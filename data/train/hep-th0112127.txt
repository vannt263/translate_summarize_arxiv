    "non - commutative theories have generated a lot of interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "these are theories defined on a manifold where the coordinates do not commute . as a result ,",
    "in such theories , there is a natural second rank anti - symmetric tensor with the canonical dimension of inverse mass squared .",
    "several interesting features develop in such theories .",
    "first of all , because of non - commutativity of coordinates , the natural product of functions , on such a space , is the star product of grnewold and moyal @xcite .",
    "one of the consequences of such a product is that , in a physical theory , the interaction terms develop a momentum dependent phase factor ( in momentum space ) .",
    "however , the two point functions and , therefore , the propagators do not modify .",
    "furthermore , explicit loop calculations show that the conventional ultraviolet terms in a commutative theory get distributed into two parts  one that is ultraviolet divergent while the other is ultraviolet finite .",
    "however , these ultraviolet finite terms become singular in the infrared limit and the amplitudes become non - analytic .",
    "all these features are quite fascinating and puzzling , since they are somewhat similar to what happens in thermal field theories @xcite . for example , we know that , at finite temperature , we have a new scale , the temperature , and an additional , natural lorentz vector , @xmath0 , which is the velocity of the heat bath . in a thermal field theory , however , the interaction vertices do not modify , rather the propagators do , because of ( anti ) periodic boundary conditions . in this sense , thermal field theories and non - commutative field theories seem complementary and a natural question of interest is whether there is any redefinition of variables that may map one to the other .",
    "it is also known that no new ultraviolet divergences develop at finite temperature .",
    "however , the infrared divergences do become more severe , once again similar to what happens in non - commutative theories , at least in one loop .",
    "even more fascinating is the observation that , at finite temperature , amplitudes become non - analytic at the origin in the energy - momentum plane , which is reminiscent of the non - analyticity in non - commutative theories . in thermal field theories , the physical origin of the non - analyticity is well understood .",
    "namely , in a thermal medium , new channels of reaction develop leading to new branch cuts , which is the reason for the non - analyticity . in the same spirit , it will be interesting to understand if there is a physical origin of the non - analyticity in non - commutative theories .",
    "a lot is already known about thermal field theories and even though we do not yet know whether non - commutative theories and thermal theories can be mapped into each other , we may make use of some of the techniques that have been developed in connection with thermal field theories , to learn more about non - commutative field theories .",
    "it is with this goal that we take up a systematic study of the photon self - energy in non - commutative qed in a general covariant gauge in arbitrary dimensions . since the contribution of the fermion loop to the photon self - energy has been studied in detail in the past , we concentrate only on the contributions coming from internal gauge and ghost loops .",
    "our study leads to a number of interesting features that bring out similarities and differences between thermal field theories and non - commutative field theories .",
    "for example , we find that although non - commutative qed has a non - abelian character because of the star product , the self - energy is transverse to all orders in a general covariant gauge in any dimension .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the self - energy of thermal qcd , which is , in general , not transverse .",
    "we verify this all orders result by explicitly calculating the self - energy at one loop .",
    "the calculations in a gauge theory are , of course , best carried out in dimensional regularization .",
    "however , most of the calculations in non - commutative theories , so far , have used the method due to schwinger ( the difficulty is mainly due to the exponential phase factor ) .",
    "therefore , as a first step , we have generalized the formulae of dimensional regularization to non - commutative theories and this indeed simplifies the calculations quite a bit .",
    "the explicit calculation , at one loop , shows that the self - energy is gauge dependent , but does not develop any new kind of ultraviolet divergence , so that the theory is renormalizable . furthermore , in the infrared limit , the imaginary part of the contributions to the self - energy , coming from these graphs , identically vanishes .",
    "this is , in fact , interesting in that the non - analyticity in the non - commutative qed does not seem to be connected with new imaginary parts in the amplitude .",
    "away from the infrared , however , the self - energy does have imaginary parts which are necessary for unitarity .",
    "the gauge dependence of the self - energy raises the question of the behavior of the poles of the photon propagator in this theory and we prove to all orders , using the nielsen identity @xcite , that , in spite of the gauge dependence of the self - energy , the poles of the propagator are gauge independent .    the paper is organized as follows . in section * ii * , we briefly review the structure of non - commutative qed . in section",
    "* iii * , drawing from previous experience with thermal field theories , we show that the photon self - energy , in this theory , is transverse to all orders in a general covariant gauge in any dimension . in section * iv * , we generalize the formulae of dimensional regularization to non - commutative theories .",
    "one loop calculations , using dimensional regularization , are presented in section * v * , where we also talk about various aspects of the result . in section",
    "* vi * , we analyze the imaginary part of the photon self - energy and bring out some interesting features associated with it . in section * vii * , we prove , using the nielsen identity , that the poles of the photon propagator are gauge independent to all orders .",
    "we present a short conclusion in section * viii * and give details on the derivation of the nielsen identity in the appendix .",
    "non - commutative qed differs from the conventional commutative qed in the following manner .",
    "first of all , the theory is defined on a manifold , where the coordinates do not commute .",
    "rather , they satisfy @xmath1 = i \\theta^{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 has the canonical dimension of inverse mass squared . to avoid problems with unitarity",
    ", we will assume that only the space - space components of @xmath3 are nonzero , namely , that the time coordinate commutes with all the coordinates .",
    "an immediate consequence of the non - commutativity of coordinates is that products of functions on this manifold are naturally defined by the grnewold - moyal star product @xmath4_{\\zeta=0=\\eta}\\ ] ] the star product also naturally introduces a moyal bracket of two bosonic functions as @xmath5_{\\rm mb } = f\\star g - g\\star f\\ ] ]    with these , we can define the action for non - commutative qed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of space - time dimensions and @xmath8_{\\rm mb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this action can be easily verified to be invariant under the gauge transformations @xmath9 infinitesimally , the transformations take the form @xmath10_{\\rm mb}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the parameter of infinitesimal transformations .",
    "we can , of course , add to this action a gauge fixing and a ghost action . for covariant gauge fixing , they will have the form @xmath12_{\\rm mb})\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the gauge fixing parameter .",
    "we note , therefore , that we can write the complete action for non - commutative qed in a general covariant gauge as @xmath14    thus , we see that because of the star product , the action in ( [ action ] ) , for non - commutative qed , has a non - abelian structure through the moyal bracket .",
    "the star product has some interesting consequences .",
    "in particular , under an integral , the star product of two functions is the same as an ordinary product ( namely , the difference between the two integrands is a total divergence that integrates to zero for functions with appropriate asymptotic fall off ) .",
    "similarly , the star product of any number of functions , under an integral , satisfies cyclicity . as a result of these , it follows that the two point functions and the propagators of a non - commutative field theory are the same as their commutative counterparts . however , the interaction vertices have an exponential dependence on @xmath3 as well as the momenta carried by the fields .",
    "thus , for example , for the action in ( [ action ] ) , the feynman rules for the theory are as follows .",
    "first , the propagators of the theory are @xmath15 these are the same as in the commutative theory .",
    "introducing the notation , @xmath16 the vertices , on the other hand , have the following forms ( with the momentum conserving delta functions omitted ) @xmath17\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\nonumber\\\\ \\begin{array}{c}\\includegraphics*{f16_quart.eps}\\end{array }   & : \\;\\;\\ ;   & \\;\\;\\ ;   - 4\\ , e^{2}\\left[(\\eta^{\\mu\\lambda}\\eta^{\\nu\\rho } -   \\eta^{\\mu\\rho}\\eta^{\\nu\\lambda } ) \\sin { p_{1}\\times p_{2}\\over 2 } \\sin   { p_{3}\\times p_{4}\\over 2}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\   &   & \\qquad\\quad + ( \\eta^{\\mu\\rho}\\eta^{\\nu\\lambda } -   \\eta^{\\mu\\nu}\\eta^{\\lambda\\rho } ) \\sin { p_{3}\\times p_{1}\\over 2 } \\sin   { p_{2}\\times p_{4}\\over 2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\nonumber\\\\   &   & \\qquad\\quad\\left .",

    "the star product , of course , introduces a non - abelian structure in this theory .",
    "but more than that , in such theories , we have an independent lorentz structure which can , in principle , introduce a behavior parallel to that at finite temperature . for example , in the self - energy , there is one independent external momentum so that we can think of @xmath18 as being analogous to the component of the velocity of the heat bath perpendicular to momentum at finite temperature .",
    "a lot is known about the self - energy of commutative yang - mills theory at finite temperature and our goal is to exploit the known features of such studies to understand the behavior of the self - energy in non - commutative qed in a general covariant gauge in any dimension . even though our actual calculations are at one loop , in the process , we will find some interesting all orders results for the self - energy as well as the propagator in non - commutative qed .",
    "it is well known in commutative qcd that , at finite temperature , the self - energy is not transverse in a general covariant gauge @xcite ( it is transverse at one loop , only in the feynman gauge ) . in spite of the apparent similarity of non - commutative theories with thermal field theories , we will show in the following that the photon self - energy in non - commutative qed is transverse to all orders in any covariant gauge and in any dimension , which is the behavior of the gauge self - energy in commutative qcd at zero temperature .    to show this ,",
    "let us introduce some techniques from finite temperature field theory @xcite .",
    "consider a theory with a natural vector @xmath0 ( for example , the velocity of the heat bath at finite temperature ) .",
    "then , given a momentum vector @xmath19 , let us define the component of @xmath0 orthogonal to @xmath19 as @xmath20 in such a theory , the self - energy for the gauge field will have the most general , all orders decomposition given by @xmath21 it follows from this that @xmath22 unless @xmath23 .    adding the tree level two point function , we can write the complete two point function to all orders as @xmath24 + { p^{\\mu}p^{\\nu}\\over \\xi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the complete propagator is defined to be @xmath25 and satisfies , in consequence of the slavnov - taylor identity @xcite , @xmath26",
    "let us now define @xmath27 then , it follows , in a simple manner , that @xmath28 this shows that @xmath29 has a zero mode , which can be explicitly constructed to be @xmath30 with @xmath31    thus far , our analysis has been quite general .",
    "let us next turn to non - commutative qed . in this case",
    ", we can identify @xmath32 furthermore , from the feynman rules , let us note that the self - energy diagrams ( involving internal photon and ghost lines ) are invariant under @xmath33 therefore , the self - energy must be an even function of @xmath34 .",
    "( we note here that this property holds even with fermion interactions and is a consequence of charge conjugation invariance of the two point function @xcite . )",
    "it follows , then , that the coefficient , @xmath35 , in ( [ decomp ] ) must be odd in @xmath34 .",
    "since it is a scalar function , the most general form it can have is @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes a scalar function , even in @xmath34 , and we have used the fact that @xmath34 is orthogonal to @xmath19 . since @xmath38 , it follows from ( [ zero ] ) that @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , to all orders , we determine that the most general form for the self - energy in non - commutative qed , in a general covariant gauge in any dimension , can be written as @xmath40 which is manifestly transverse .",
    "( note that , in this case , the zero mode in ( [ zeromode ] ) simply reduces to @xmath41 . )",
    "the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 , of course , will be dependent on the gauge fixing parameter , unlike in commutative qed , and we would like to evaluate these functions at one loop .",
    "the calculations in non - commutative field theory have so far been mostly carried out using the methods of schwinger . however , from studies in commutative gauge field theories , we know that dimensional regularization @xcite is extremely simple and powerful which , while maintaining gauge invariance , allows the proof of many results in a natural manner .",
    "therefore , it is quite useful to try to extend the method of dimensional regularization to non - commutative theories @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we will derive the dimensional regularization formulae , relevant to non - commutative theories in two different ways , both leading to the same results .    in non - commutative theories ( for example , in non - commutative qed , see ( [ vertex ] ) ) , the interactions involve a momentum dependent phase factor .",
    "therefore , a generic loop integral , that arises in such theories , has the form @xmath44 where we have defined @xmath45 with @xmath46 representing a function of the external momenta , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 represents the term that arises from combining denominators using the feynman parameters and shifting .",
    "@xmath48 , in general , depends on the external momenta , masses of the theory as well as the feynman parameters . for simplicity ,",
    "we have ignored writing the integration over the feynman parameters that needs to be carried out . to evaluate this integral",
    ", we first rotate to euclidean space , so that we have ( note that with our choice of @xmath3 having only space indices , the exponent does not change sign upon rotation to euclidean space ) @xmath49    it is the momentum dependent exponential that seems formidable . however , it turns out that it is not hard to evaluate integrals of this kind and let us present two different , but equivalent ways that lead to the same result .",
    "first of all , let us decompose the vector @xmath50 to longitudinal and transverse components with respect to @xmath51 .",
    "let us introduce the decomposition , @xmath52 so that @xmath53    in terms of these components , then , we can write @xmath54    recalling that @xmath55 is parallel to @xmath51 , we note that @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 . therefore , defining a new variable @xmath59 , we can write the integral as @xmath60 here @xmath61 denotes the bessel function and , in the intermediate steps , we have used some identities involving the gamma functions @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that the identification of the last integral with the bessel function is strictly valid when @xmath62 , where it is straightforward to show , with the help of standard tables that @xmath63 so that we have @xmath64 however , as in dimensional regularization in commutative theories , we analytically continue this result to other dimensions .",
    "let us next give an alternate derivation of the dimensional regularization formula for our basic integral .",
    "we note that @xmath65 which is exactly the same formula as derived earlier in ( [ dimreg ] ) .",
    "this , therefore , generalizes dimensional regularization to non - commutative theories and evaluates the basic integral that arises in a non - commutative field theory . in the study of self - energy in gauge theories , however , we need integrals involving additional tensor structures , which can be evaluated in the following simple manner . first , let us note that , if we are interested in the self - energy , there is only one independent external momentum and , therefore , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the external momentum .",
    "second , in this case , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the feynman parameter that arises in combining two denominators .",
    "now , if we introduce an auxiliary vector @xmath70 , then , we obtain , following our earlier derivation in ( [ dimreg ] ) , that @xmath71 for small values of @xmath72 , expanding in a taylor series and using identities involving the bessel functions , this result would generate the integrals involving all other tensor structures .    for completeness",
    ", we list below the euclidean forms of the integrals that we will need in the subsequent sections .",

    "in this section , we will explicitly evaluate the self - energy at one loop , using dimensional regularization .",
    "however , even before doing the calculation , let us verify explicitly that the self - energy is indeed transverse at one loop , as a check on our general result of section * iii*.    there are three graphs for the self - energy , at one loop , that we are interested in , namely , the one with the internal ghost loop , the tadpole involving the four photon vertex and the one involving an internal gauge loop ( see figures 1a , 1b and 1c ) .",
    "each of these three graphs has the form ( see([propagator],[vertex ] ) ) @xmath75 where @xmath76\\nonumber\\\\ n_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\rm ( gauge ) } & = & r_{\\mu\\nu } + ( 1-\\xi ) s_{\\mu\\nu } + ( 1-\\xi)^{2 } t_{\\mu\\nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77\\nonumber\\\\ s_{\\mu\\nu } & = & 2 \\left [ { ( k^{2}+2p\\cdot k)^{2}\\over k^{2}}\\,\\eta_{\\mu\\nu } - { k^{2}+ 2p\\cdot k - p^{2}\\over k^{2}}\\,k_{\\mu}k_{\\nu } + p_{\\mu}p_{\\nu } - { k^{2}+ 3p\\cdot k\\over k^{2}}\\ , ( k_{\\mu}p_{\\nu}+k_{\\nu}p_{\\mu } ) + ( k\\rightarrow k+p , p\\rightarrow -p)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ t_{\\mu\\nu } & = & - 2\\,{(p^{2}k_{\\mu } - p\\cdot k\\,p_{\\mu})(p^{2 } k_{\\nu } - p\\cdot k\\,p_{\\nu})\\over k^{2 } ( k+p)^{2}}\\label{gauge}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , adding the three terms , we see that the self - energy has a natural expansion in powers of @xmath78 ( @xmath79 corresponds to the feynman gauge ) .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath80 come only from the graph with the gauge loop and its structure , as can be seen from ( [ gauge ] ) , is manifestly transverse .",
    "there are two terms proportional to @xmath78 , coming from the tadpole as well as the gauge loop diagrams .",
    "if we add them , combine the denominators using feynman parameters and shift the integration variable , we obtain @xmath81\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] contracting with @xmath67 , it can be seen that this vanishes upon symmetric integration .",
    "therefore , the terms linear in @xmath78 are explicitly transverse as well . in a similar manner",
    ", it can also be checked that the terms independent of @xmath78 are transverse .",
    "alternatively , let us note that the terms independent of @xmath78 would correspond to the self - energy in the feynman gauge ( @xmath79 ) , which have been explicitly checked earlier to be transverse at one loop .",
    "thus , we see from the structure of the graphs that they are manifestly transverse at one loop , consistent with our all orders result .",
    "thus , let us parameterize the self - energy as in ( [ selfenergy ] ) ( with the identification @xmath82 ) and write @xmath83 it follows from this that @xmath84 in spite of the appearance of @xmath85 factors in the denominator , we will see that these quantities are well behaved at @xmath86 ( namely , two dimensions )",
    ".    let us further expand each of these coefficients in powers of @xmath78 , @xmath87 where we have used the fact that the self - energy diagrams are at most quadratic in @xmath78 .",
    "the subscripts here correspond to the power of @xmath78 and the lowest order terms simply correspond to the coefficients in the feynman gauge .",
    "we can combine denominators and integrate over the internal momenta using formulae ( [ dimreg1 ] ) for the terms depending on @xmath88 and use the conventional formulae of dimensional regularization for the term independent of @xmath3 .",
    "as we have mentioned earlier , the usual results of dimensional regularization can be obtained through the simple substitution @xmath89 therefore , it is enough to use the formulae in ( [ dimreg1 ] ) to do the complete integrals and , with a little bit of algebra , we can write the results as @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92\\nonumber\\\\ b_{2 } & = & -{1\\over 4}\\left [ ( n-6)\\left((|\\bar{\\theta}|m)^{3-{n\\over 2 } } k_{3-{n\\over 2 } } ( |\\bar{\\theta}|m ) - 2^{2-{n\\over 2 } } \\gamma(3-{n\\over 2})\\right ) + \\left((|\\bar{\\theta}|m)^{4-{n\\over 2 } } k_{4-{n\\over 2 } } ( |\\bar{\\theta}|m ) - 2^{3-{n\\over 2 } } \\gamma(4-{n\\over 2})\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    combining all the factors , we obtain ( after rotation to the minkowski space ) @xmath93\\nonumber\\\\ b & = & { e^{2}\\pi^{n\\over 2}\\over ( 2\\pi)^{n}}\\,(2p^{2})^{{n\\over 2}-1 } \\int_{0}^{1 } dx ( x(1-x))^{{n\\over 2}-2 } \\left[-4(n-2)^{2 } x(1-x)\\left((|\\bar{\\theta}|m)^{1-{n\\over 2 } } k_{1-{n\\over 2 } } ( |\\bar{\\theta}|m ) - 2^{-{n\\over 2 } } \\gamma(1-{n\\over 2})\\right)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\   &   & \\qquad + \\left((6 - 4n ) x(1-x ) + 1 - 2x^{2 } + 2(1-\\xi)(n-4)x\\right)\\left((|\\bar{\\theta}|m)^{2-{n\\over 2 } } k_{2-{n\\over 2 } } ( |\\bar{\\theta}|m ) - 2^{1-{n\\over 2 } } \\gamma(2-{n\\over 2})\\right)\\nonumber\\\\   &   & \\qquad + ( 1-\\xi)\\left(2x - ( n-6){(1-\\xi)\\over 4}\\right)\\left((|\\bar{\\theta}|m)^{3-{n\\over 2 } } k_{3-{n\\over 2 } } ( |\\bar{\\theta}|m ) - 2^{2-{n\\over 2 } } \\gamma(3-{n\\over 2})\\right)\\nonumber\\\\   &   & \\qquad\\left . -",

    "therefore , all the ultraviolet divergences are contained in @xmath42 and can be subtracted by the usual wave function renormalization counterterms .",
    "we do not need any counterterm with a new structure in the non - commutative qed , which would have rendered the theory unrenormalizable .",
    "second , when @xmath86 , @xmath96 ( since there is only one space direction ) . in two dimensions ,",
    "the theory is ultraviolet finite by power counting and gauge invariance , therefore , the @xmath97 limit can be taken smoothly in our results . in this limit , of course , @xmath98 so that we will expect these structures to vanish when @xmath86 .",
    "this can be explicitly checked in the following way .",
    "note that when the integral is convergent , as noted in ( [ convgt ] ) , @xmath99 in such a case , every term inside the parenthesis will cancel pairwise to give a vanishing result .",

    "this is a general feature that is completely parallel with the studies at finite temperature ( see next section for more details ) .",
    "as for the coefficient @xmath43 , we have already seen that all the @xmath95 terms cancel out in any dimension , so that @xmath105 the leading order term coming from the bessel functions , as @xmath102 , in four dimensions has the form @xmath106\\label{sing}\\ ] ] which agrees with the results in references @xcite for qed in 4-dimensions .",
    "( we remark here that the leading order contribution , as @xmath107 , comes from the @xmath108 term in ( [ b ] ) , whose coefficient is gauge independent . )",
    "as is well known , non - commutative theories do not have a unique @xmath97 limit .",
    "this non - analyticity is quite analogous to the behavior in thermal field theories , where the amplitudes become non - analytic at the origin in the energy - momentum plane . in the case of thermal field theories",
    ", there is a physical reason for such a non - analyticity , namely , at finite temperature , new channels of reaction develop leading to new thermal branch cuts , and this leads to the non - analyticity .",
    "correspondingly , it would be interesting to ask if the non - commutative qed theory develops any new @xmath3 dependent imaginary parts in the amplitude .    to this end ,",
    "let us start by looking at the self - energy in a non - commutative @xmath109 theory in @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "we choose the scalar field to be massless so as to keep the parallel with non - commutative qed . in this case , the basic integral for the non - planar part of the self - energy has the form ( in euclidean space ) @xmath110 where we are neglecting some overall multiplicative factors for simplicity .",
    "this integral can be evaluated using ( [ dimreg1 ] ) and gives ( after rotation to minkowski space ) @xmath111 where , in the minkowski space @xmath112 .",
    "the planar part of the self - energy , on the other hand , has no exponential factor in the integrand and the result is @xmath113    we note that for @xmath114 , the integral is ultraviolet convergent and , in the limit @xmath107 , ( [ scalar ] ) yields the result in ( [ scalar1 ] ) . in such a case , we do not expect any non - analyticity in the theory . on the other hand ,",
    "it is for @xmath115 that ultraviolet divergences are present leading to ir / uv mixing , which is the main reason for the non - analytic behavior as @xmath97 .",

    "let us note that , unlike the real part , the imaginary part of ( [ expansion ] ) , which comes from the @xmath127 terms , is a well behaved function in the limit @xmath102 .",
    "the leading imaginary part which arises from this when @xmath102 , comes from the term @xmath128 it is interesting to note that the @xmath127 term in the planar and the non - planar terms have the same coefficient .",
    "this is very much like the behavior of @xmath129 terms in thermal field theories ( here , @xmath130 is the temperature ) .",
    "namely , while there is no direct relation between the ultraviolet divergence in a field theory and powers of @xmath130 , the coefficient of @xmath129 coincides with that of the pole @xmath131 @xcite . here , too , the same behavior seems to arise .",
    "the same discussion carries over to non - commutative qed , where the imaginary parts of the non - planar terms in ( [ b ] ) may be evaluated using the relation ( for @xmath132 ) @xmath133 let us note that , in the case of qed , the planar and the non - planar terms come with opposite sign because of the factor @xmath134 . as a result , to leading order , the imaginary parts cancel in the self - energy . however , there are higher order terms in the expansion of the bessel function in ( [ bessel ] ) , which can contribute an imaginary part to the self - energy . when @xmath102 , however , these vanish quite rapidly . on the other hand , for finite @xmath124 , these imaginary parts are present and are , in fact , necessary for unitarity to hold @xcite . as we have seen in the last section , the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the self - energy",
    "are gauge dependent .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the imaginary parts coming from the higher order terms in the bessel function will also become gauge dependent .",
    "this is slightly surprising in that we would expect the imaginary part of an amplitude to be related to a physical cross section , which has to be gauge independent .",
    "the puzzle is resolved by noting that the physical process to which the photon self - energy can contribute is the electron - electron scattering amplitude ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "although the imaginary part of the self - energy graph is gauge dependent in this theory , it turns out that the other diagrams are also gauge dependent so that the sum of all such contributions can become gauge independent .",
    "as we have already seen in section * v * , the coefficient functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the photon self - energy are gauge dependent .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask what happens to the poles of the photon propagator in such a theory . in",
    "what follows , we will show that , in spite of the gauge dependence of the self - energy , the poles in the photon propagator are gauge independent to all orders .",
    "following our discussions in section * iii * , we note that the general structure of the complete two point function for the photon ( to all orders ) has the form ( with @xmath135 ) @xmath136 drawing from previous experience at finite temperature @xcite , we note that , for the purpose of analyzing the gauge independence of the poles of the propagator , it is better to rewrite the two point function as @xmath137 it is easy to determine from this that the exact propagator for the photon has the form @xmath138 this reduces to the tree level propagator when @xmath139 and the exact propagator satisfies the t hooft identity , @xmath140 .",
    "the main reason for rewriting the two point function in the form ( [ decomp1 ] ) is that the two structures @xmath141 are orthogonal , transverse projection operators satisfying @xmath142 which will be quite useful in the following analysis .",
    "furthermore , in this way of writing , we see clearly that the propagator has two independent poles at @xmath143 .",
    "( the pole in the longitudinal part has a gauge dependent residue and is clearly unphysical .",
    "note that , at finite temperature , the physical poles are related to the debye and the plasmon masses . )",
    "the gauge dependence of the two point function and , therefore , of the poles of the propagator can be analyzed through nielsen identities , which we will derive in the appendix . for the present ,",
    "let us simply note that the change in the two point function , under a change in the gauge fixing parameter , can be written as ( in momentum space ) @xmath144\\label{var}\\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath145 is described in the appendix . taking the projection of ( [ var ] ) with @xmath146 , we obtain , @xmath147 similarly , taking the projection of ( [ var ] ) with @xmath148 , we obtain , @xmath149    these two equations are quite interesting as they say that , since @xmath150 as well as @xmath151 change homogeneously as we change the gauge fixing parameter , the zeroes of these functions are gauge independent",
    ". correspondingly , the poles of the propagator are gauge independent .",
    "namely , even though the photon two point function is gauge dependent , to all orders , the poles of the photon propagator are gauge independent ( in any dimension ) .",
    "let us note here that an important consequence of this property is that the most infrared singular term in the above equations must be gauge independent . otherwise , the poles of the propagator would not have a gauge independent location .",
    "in fact , by explicit calculation , we find that this term appears in @xmath43 in the gauge independent form @xmath152 which clearly vanishes for @xmath86 and which can be compared with ( [ sing ] ) for @xmath153 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the contributions of gauge and ghost loops to the photon self - energy in non - commutative qed , in a general covariant gauge _ and _ in any dimension ( the fermion contributions have been studied earlier ) .",
    "we have shown that , to all orders , the self - energy is transverse and we have explicitly evaluated the one - loop graphs , which verify this .",
    "our calculations have used dimensional regularization , which we have generalized to non - commutative theories .",
    "the explicit calculation shows that there are no new kinds of ultraviolet divergences coming from these diagrams so that the theory is renormalizable @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the imaginary parts coming from these graphs cancel identically in the infrared limit , although away from the infrared limit , the self - energy does have @xmath154-dependent imaginary parts which are necessary for unitarity .",
    "since the photon self - energy is gauge dependent , we use the nielsen identity to show that the poles of the photon propagator are gauge independent to all orders .",
    "generally , the @xmath154-dependent infrared divergent terms that arise , to one - loop order , in non - commutative theories have inappropriate behavior .",
    "however , since we do not find any imaginary part associated with such a non - analyticity , it suggests that such behavior may not , in fact , be physical .",
    "drawing from studies of non - commutative scalar models @xcite , which make use of techniques developed in connection with thermal field theories , we conjecture that a resummation to all orders may eliminate the unphysical infrared singularities in non - commutative qed .",
    ".5 cm    we would like to thank professor j. c. taylor for many helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by us doe grant number de - fg-02 - 91er40685 and by cnpq and fapesp , brazil .",
    "in this appendix , we will derive the nielsen identity used in section * vii * to prove the gauge independence of the poles of the propagator .",
    "let us start with the action for non - commutative qed given in ( [ action ] ) , where we write the gauge fixing term as @xmath155 here @xmath156 is an auxiliary field whose equation of motion gives @xmath157 which we will use later in the analysis .",
    "however , it is more convenient to begin with the auxiliary field formulation of the gauge fixing , since it allows the brst transformations of the theory to close off - shell .",
    "the brst transformations for non - commutative qed , in this formulation , become @xmath158_{\\rm mb}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta c & = & - { \\omega\\over 2}\\,c\\star c\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta \\bar{c } & = & - \\omega f\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta f & = & 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath159 is an anti - commuting space - time independent parameter and the action @xmath160 , which includes gauge fixing and ghosts , is invariant under these transformations .",
    "let us now add to our action source terms @xmath161 here , we have the usual sources for the fields , sources for the composite brst variations and finally , we have added one extra source ( the last term ) whose meaning will become clear shortly .",
    "the action involving the sources is not invariant under the brst transformations and gives @xmath162    let us next define the generating functional as @xmath163\\ , e^{i(s + s_{\\rm source})}\\ ] ] where @xmath164 represents all the fields being integrated and the generating functional depends only on the sources .",
    "it is clear now that , under a brst field redefinition inside the path integral , the generating functional will not change , since the sources are unaffected by such a transformation .",
    "this leads to @xmath165\\,(\\delta s + \\delta s_{\\rm source})\\,e^{i(s + s_{\\rm source } ) } & = & 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath160 is invariant , using the form of @xmath166 from ( [ source ] ) , we obtain , @xmath167\\,\\left(\\int d^{n}z\\,h(z)\\star { \\partial { \\cal l}\\over \\partial \\xi}\\right ) e^{i(s+s_{\\rm source } ) } = - \\int d^{n}z\\,\\left(j^{\\mu}\\star { \\delta w\\over \\delta k^{\\mu}(z ) } - i\\bar{\\eta}(z)\\star { \\delta w\\over \\delta l(z ) } + i { \\delta w\\over \\delta j(z)}\\star \\eta(z)\\right)\\ ] ] taking the derivative of this with respect to @xmath168 , setting it to zero and integrating over @xmath69 , we obtain @xmath169    we can now define the effective action , @xmath95 , through the legendre transformation @xmath170 then , the identity in ( [ iden ] ) can be written as @xmath171 taking the second derivative with respect to @xmath172 and @xmath173 , setting @xmath174 and setting all other fields equal to zero , we obtain @xmath175 here , the restriction is understood as setting @xmath176 and , then , setting all the fields equal to zero , after taking the functional derivatives .",
    "this is the identity used in section * vii * ( see ( [ var ] ) ) , where we have identified , @xmath177 a graphical representation for @xmath178 to lowest orders is shown in figure 3 ."
