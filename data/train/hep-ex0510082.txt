    "the large amount of hadronic photon - photon interactions at high energies recorded by the lep collaborations during the lepii program has led to several measurements that permit us to investigate the validity of perturbative qcd for such processes .",
    "the emerging picture confirms qcd as the correct theory to describe these interactions .",
    "there are , however , several disagreements that still need to be understood .",
    "this article will review the current state of affairs and highlight areas where more work needs to be done .",
    "many more observables than can be discussed here are available in the original publications . in all measurements discussed in this article",
    "the photons entering the photon - photon collisions are quasi - real .",
    "delphi  @xcite and opal  @xcite have studied the production of di - jets at centre - of - mass energies from 189 to 209gev , with a total integrated luminosity of and , respectively .",
    "di - jet events are of particular interest , as the two jets can be used to estimate the fraction of the photon momentum participating in the hard interaction , , which is a sensitive probe of the structure of the photon .",
    "the -clustering algorithm@xcite is used for the measurement of the differential cross - sections , because of the advantages of this algorithm in comparing to theoretical calculations@xcite .    in leading order ( lo ) qcd , neglecting multiple parton interactions ,",
    "two hard parton jets are produced in interactions . in single- or double - resolved interactions ,",
    "these jets are expected to be accompanied by one or two remnant jets .",
    "a pair of variables , and , can be defined that estimate the fraction of the photon s momentum participating in the hard scattering : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the momentum component along the @xmath2 axis of the detector and @xmath3 is the energy of the jets or objects of the hadronic final state ( hfs ) . in lo , for direct events , all energy of the event is contained in two jets , i.e. ,  @xmath4 and @xmath5 , whereas for single - resolved or double - resolved events one or both values are smaller than  1 .",
    "differential cross sections as a function of or in regions of are therefore a sensitive probe of the structure of the photon .    the experimental results are compared to a perturbative qcd calculation at next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite which uses the parametrisation of the parton distribution functions of the photon@xcite .",

    "the cross section predicted for the case or @xmath8 is also in good agreement with the opal measurement .",

    "the shaded histogram on the bottom of each of the three plots indicates the contribution of mia to the cross section as obtained from the pythia mc generator .",
    "it is evident especially for @xmath10 that the mia contribution is of about the same size as the discrepancy between the measurement and the nlo prediction .",
    "furthermore it is interesting to observe that there is next to no mia contribution to the cross section if either or is required to be less than one , while the sensitivity to the photon structure at small is retained . as one would expect also the agreement of the nlo calculation with the measurement is best in this case . for large the nlo calculation",
    "does not agree well with the data .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that the calculation of the cross section becomes increasingly problematic when approaching @xmath11@xcite .    especially with these last measurements",
    "one is able to disentangle the hard subprocess from soft contributions and make the firm statement that nlo perturbative qcd is adequate to describe di - jet production in photon - photon collisions in the regions of phase space where the calculation can be expected to be complete and reliable , i.e. where mia contributions are small and for not too close to unity . at the same time",
    "a different sub - set of observables can be used to study in more detail the nature of the soft processes leading to the underlying event .",
    "the l3 collaboration has measured inclusive jet production in photon - photon interactions  @xcite . a total integrated luminosity of 560 recorded at centre - of - mass energies @xmath12gev is used .",
    "jets are reconstructed using the -clustering algorithm and analysed in the pseudorapidity range @xmath13 for jet transverse momenta @xmath14gev . the remaining background from other processes after event selection increases from about 5% at low @xmath15 to about 20% at high @xmath15 .",
    "this background is subtracted bin - by - bin from the data before corrections for selection efficiency and detector acceptance are applied .",
    "the differential cross section as a function of @xmath15 is shown in fig.[fig : xgcomb ] .",
    "the distribution can be described by a power law function @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "a comparison to an nlo perturbative qcd calculation  @xcite using the parton density functions fails to describe the data for jet transverse momenta larger than about 25gev .",
    "this calculation was shown to be in agreement with the calculation compared to the di - jet observables above .",
    "there is clearly a need here for additional data to be published to confirm or contradict the observed discrepancy .",
    "[ sngl ]     l3 has studied the production of charged and neutral pions in 414 of data recorded at @xmath18 centre - of - mass energies @xmath12gev . the right plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : had ] shows the transverse momentum spectrum of charged pions .",
    "it is evident that the corresponding calculation in nlo qcd fails to describe the data for momenta larger than about 4gev . at the highest charged particle momenta",
    "measured the theory underestimates the data by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "a similar measurement by l3 of neutral pion production  @xcite leads to the same conclusions . yet",
    "the presence of high momentum particles should indicate the presence of a hard scale , and the perturbative calculation should be reliable .",
    "the discrepancy can therefore not easily be understood in terms of the nlo calculation on parton level .",
    "furthermore at high momenta the interaction of two photons is expected to be dominated by the so - called direct process , i.e. the exchange of a fermion , such that uncertainties in the knowledge of the photon structure are not expected to be very important .",
    "the experimental background at the largest momenta measured has been estimated from mc to be about 20% , and is subtracted from the data before the comparisons with theory are carried out . to compare the parton level calculation to the data",
    ", it is folded with the appropriate fragmentation function .",
    "it is not expected that fragmentation effects could explain discrepancies of this magnitude .",
    "furthermore in the study of single jet production described above , which is sensitive to the same partonic processes , no fragmentation functions are used in comparing data and theory .",
    "hadronisation corrections in the upper half of the transverse momentum spectrum shown in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : xgcomb ] are estimated to be below 10% .",
    "one has to conclude that these discrepancies seen in the l3 data are very significant , and at present not understood .",
    "delphi has performed a similar measurement of charged hadron production in 617 of data with centre - of - mass energies @xmath19gev  @xcite . the right plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : had ] shows the delphi data in comparison with l3 and the prediction of nlo qcd .",
    "the delphi measurement is clearly incompatible with the l3 data and in much better agreement with nlo qcd , if still somewhat above the calculation at larger transverse momenta . in studying the background especially at the largest",
    "available transverse momenta delphi finds that a more restrictive event selection is needed in their case to reduce the background to an acceptable level .",
    "this concerns in particular the upper limits on the total energy or on the total invariant hadronic mass in the event used to suppress background from hadronic decays of the @xmath20 . when modelling their selection on the one used by l3 , delphi observes the high transverse momentum region to be dominated by this background .",
    "while this may serve as an indication of the difficulties involved in measuring the hadron spectra in the region of large transverse momenta , it should be noted that the level of background to a signal process remaining after a set of selection criteria have been applied depends to some extend on the experimental apparatus , and hence can not be directly compared across experiments .    the left plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : had ] compares the delphi data to an older measurement of opal  @xcite at lower energies .",
    "the opal data do not yet reach high enough in transverse momentum to contribute to the discussion of the data - theory discrepancies observed by l3 .",
    "measurements of high momentum hadron production from aleph and opal using the full lepii data set would clearly be very interesting to see .",
