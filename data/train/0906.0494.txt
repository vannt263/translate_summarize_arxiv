    "the origin of the singular structure of the particle mass spectrum is one of the central questions in  particle physics .  although the standard model ( sm )  furnishes a remarkable description of the physical experience , the issue about better understanding the  mass hierarchy has been always present in the research activity @xcite . in particular , this circumstance is reflected in the unsatisfying large  number of parameters which should be fixed in the sm to describe the observed masses .",
    "therefore , the search of  new approaches to consider this problem is an important theme of study nowadays .",
    "a development of  an alternative perturbation expansion for qcd , including the presence of quark and gluon condensates in the free vacuum state generating the wick expansion , has been considered in previous works @xcite . a basic issue motivating the study is the question about what could be the final strength of a  dynamically generated  quark condensate in mass less qcd , in which the free vacuum is strongly degenerated  and the underlying forces are the strongest ones in nature @xcite .  this point motivated the search for modifications of the wick expansion in this theory starting from free vacuum states including zero momentum gluon and quark condensates , in order to afterwards adiabatically connect the interaction @xcite .  a similar modification of the free vacuum leading to the perturbative expansion ,",
    "but filling real particles states up to a fermi level was before considered by p. hoyer @xcite .",
    "the modified expansion following from ref .",
    "@xcite has also close connections with other independent approaches in the literature .",
    "those consider modified free particle vacua and propagators in generating the perturbative expansion in order to take into account condensate effects @xcite .",
    "finally , we expect that in the future the analysis can show links with well established non perturbative theories considering condensation effects such as the sum rules approach and the fukuda gluon condensation studies @xcite .",
    "we would like to remark that the modified expansion being investigated could perhaps represent a theoretical foundation for the `` superconductivity systems '' like properties of the particle mass spectrum underlined in refs .",
    "this possibility is signaled by the fact that the fermion condensate generation closely resembles the similar effect in the usual bcs theory .",
    "this fact is a natural outcome since the free vacua employed to generate the expansion have the same bcs like `` squeezed '' state structure@xcite .  in ref.@xcite",
    "some indications about the possible dynamic generation of quark and gluon condensates had been obtained .",
    "nevertheless , this correction to the vacuum energy turned out to be unbounded from below as a function of the quark condensate .  in this work  we  restrict the discussion to the simpler case in which there is only one quark condensate present in the system .",
    "it is natural to  firstly consider this  situation , since the aim is to investigate the possibility that  large dynamic quark condensates and masses could define a kind of @xmath2 quark model  as an effective action for mass less qcd .  in this  case , the green functions generating functional @xmath3 of the system obtained in ref.@xcite , is here transformed to a more helpful representation . in this form @xmath3",
    "is expressed as the same functional integral associated  to mass less  qcd , in which all the effects of the condensates are now embodied in only one special  vertex having two quark and two gluon legs .",
    "this representation allows to systematize the  diagrammatic expansion of the problem .",
    "in particular it permits to  implement the dimensional transmutation effect .",
    "the obtained path integral formula  can be expected to be also helpful in developing perturbative schemes in superconductivity theory .",
    "this formula is perhaps the central result of the present work , because it indicates a technical path through which the approach being considered , could help to  evidence that  an strong instability of massless qcd under the generation of fermion condensates , can be the explanation of the whole particle mass hierarchy ( including quark and leptons ) in  a sort of generalized  nambu - jona lasinio ssb mechanism @xcite .",
    "specifically , the structure of the vertex indicates ways for its generalization  which seem able to describe the quark mass and ckm matrices as coming from the first terms in an effective action .",
    "the application of the expansion is @xcite considered in this work , by calculating the leading logarithm of the condensate dependence of a two loop approximation considered for the effective potential .",
    "the results repeat the indication of the dynamic generation of the quark condensate obtained in previous works @xcite , but again , the potential results to be unbounded from below .",
    "however , in the present case , the obtained leading logarithm behavior reinforces the instability for large values of the quark condensate .",
    "this  outcome rises the need of performing new evaluations that could determine a minimum .",
    "the attainment of stability in the next three loop approximation is  feasible , since  squared logarithms of the condensate terms should appear , that upon showing the appropriate sign can produce a global minimum of the potential .",
    "the evaluation of the squared logarithm corrections at the  three loop level is expected to be considered elsewhere .",
    "the work also present an evaluation of the two particle propagator in a @xmath4 channel in zero order in the coupling and a ladder approximation in the condensate vertex .",
    "the singularities of the result are then analyzed by assuming the existence of a minimum of the vacuum energy at the experimental value of the top quark mass @xmath0 gev .  in this case , after also adopting the notion from the former @xmath2 quark models , in which the higgs field corresponds to the quark condensate , the results suggest that the higgs particle should be considered as a @xmath4 meson which could appear at energies  around to two times the @xmath2 quark mass .",
    "the  mass of this meson bound state is expected to be estimated after adding the gluon exchange contribution to the kernel of the bethe - salpeter equation , to the here evaluated only condensate dependent kernel .",
    "the work proceeds as follows .  in section ii",
    "the function integral formula for the states showing a quark condensate  is derived .",
    "section iii is devoted to evaluate two correction for the vacuum energy as  function of the condensate parameter .",
    "the section iv  then consider the evaluation of the two particle green function in ladder approximation in terms of the new condensate vertex and the zero order in the coupling .",
    "finally the results are reviewed in the summary .",
    "in this section we will  present a simpler representation of the generating functional of the modified massless qcd  in which a fermion condensate is introduced to define the initial vacuum state employed to generate the wick expansion @xcite .",
    "the unrenormalized form of the functional will be considered . in this case",

    "let us comment on two important issues both connected with the extension of the work .",
    "the first of them is related with the possibility that the mechanism under discussion can  describe the @xmath2 quark and @xmath142 mass scales at the same time .",
    "this opportunity is suggested after noticing two main properties : a ) the logarithmic dependence of the effective potential on the quark mass @xmath41  and b )  the presence of terms in the effective potential of the form  @xmath143 @xmath144 reflecting the instability .  to see it ,",
    "let us consider the potential in two loops ( at more loops , higher powers of the logarithm will appear ) as written in the form  @xmath145 where it is assumed that after the exact evaluation of the finite terms ( having a dependence of the form @xmath146 , the resulting coefficient shows the negative value @xmath143  further assume that the extremum of the potential as a function of @xmath41 , is situated at the @xmath2 quark mass @xmath0 gev @xmath87  and also that the dimensional regularization parameter @xmath147 is approximately given by @xmath142 @xmath148 gev .",
    "therefore , after finding the extremum of the potential over @xmath41 , the ratio of the coefficients @xmath149 is estimated as follows @xmath150 henceforth , since the instability created by the @xmath151 forces can be strong , it seems feasible that a not so large ratio value of @xmath152 could arise after evaluating the finite terms , then giving space for these two widely different scales be both predicted by the scheme .",
    "the second point about we which to remark is connected with the possibility for constructing a variant of the sm model starting from the here presented discussion .",
    "this idea may directly come to the mind by noticing that the mass terms associated to the quark and leptons in a fist approximation for an effective model are associated to the graph of the form illustrated in figure [ genmod1 ] showing one condensate vertex with two external fermion legs and a massive gluon propagator joining the two gluon legs of the vertex . in the before proposed generalized form of the vertex the indices @xmath153",
    "can correspond to quarks or leptons , a fact that lead to idea of fixing the matrix @xmath154 to reproduce the yukawa mass matrix .",
    "note that the large mass of the gluon modified propagator should make the interaction between the input and output fermions short ranged and then the vertex effectively produce a yukawa term .",
    "figure [ genmod2 ] simply intends to show some diagrams of the considered generalized model which could generate the masses for the @xmath155 and @xmath3 particles starting from the massless @xmath33 and @xmath156 vector gauge fields of the sm model.the possibilities indicated above are in some measure supported by the fact that in the context of the usual top condensate models , it has been argued that the top anti - top condensate technically implements the role of the higgs field .",
