    "an observation of grothendieck @xcite that the absolute galois group @xmath4 naturally acts on simple combinatorial objects that he called _",
    "dessins denfants _ is based on a remarkable result by belyi :    ( belyi , @xcite ) a smooth complex algebraic curve @xmath5 is defined over the field of algebraic numbers @xmath6 if and only if there exist a non - constant meromorphic function @xmath7 on @xmath5 ( or a holomorphic branched cover @xmath8 ) that is ramified only over the points @xmath9 .",
    "we call @xmath10 , where @xmath5 is a smooth complex algebraic curve and @xmath7 is a meromorphic function on @xmath5 unramified over @xmath11 , a _ belyi pair_. for a belyi pair @xmath10 denote by @xmath12 the genus of @xmath5 and by @xmath13 the degree of @xmath7 . consider the inverse image @xmath14)\\subset c$ ] of the real line segment @xmath15\\subset{\\mathbb{c}p^1}$ ] .",
    "this is a connected bicolored graph with @xmath13 edges , whose vertices of two colors are the preimages of 0 and 1 respectively , and the ribbon graph structure is induced by the embedding @xmath14)\\hookrightarrow c$ ] .",
    "( recall that a ribbon graph structure is given by prescribing a cyclic order of half - edges at each vertex of the graph . )",
    "note that a connected bicolored ribbon graph of genus @xmath12 with @xmath13 edges uniquely corresponds to a _ hypermap of genus @xmath12 on @xmath13 darts_. such that the group generated by @xmath16 acts transitively on the set @xmath17 , see @xcite . ]",
    "the following is straightforward ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) :    [ gr](grothendieck , @xcite ) there is a one - to - one correspondence between the isomorphism classes of belyi pairs and connected bicolored ribbon graphs .    a connected bicolored ribbon graph representing a belyi pair is called grothendieck s _ dessin denfant_.",
    "actually , the dessin @xmath14)\\hookrightarrow c$ ] corresponding to a belyi pair @xmath10 can naturally be extended to a bicolored triangulation of the curve @xmath5 . to see that ,",
    "let us cut @xmath18 along the real projective line into two triangles with common vertices @xmath19 , and let us color the upper and the lower triangles in two different colors ( say , white and gray , see fig .  1 )",
    ". denote by @xmath20 the number of distinct poles of @xmath7 .",
    "the complement @xmath21)$ ] is the disjoint union of @xmath22 polygons , each with an even number of sides .",
    "each such polygon contains precisely one pole of @xmath7 as its center . connecting the center of each polygon with its vertices",
    ", we obtain a triangulation of @xmath5 that is properly bicolored ( the restriction of @xmath7 to each triangle is a homeomorphism onto either upper or lower triangle of @xmath23 , and triangles of the same color can not have a common side ) .",
    "corresponding to the belyi pair @xmath24.,width=188 ]    the 3-valent graph dual to the triangulation described in the previous paragraph is connected ( because @xmath14)$ ] is ) and bicolored ( the white vertices are the centers of white triangles and the black vertices are the centers of gray triangles , see fig .  1 )",
    ". moreover , its edges can be properly colored into 3 colors : the edges intersecting @xmath25)$ ] are colored in blue , the edges intersecting @xmath14)$ ]  in green , and the edges intersecting @xmath26)$ ]  in red .",
    "the ribbon graph structure is given by the blue - green - red order of edges at white vertices and red - green - blue  at black vertices ( both in the counterclockwise direction ) .",
    "such a connected bicolored 3-edge colored ribbon graph we call a _",
    "belyi graph_.    there is a one - to - one correspondence between the isomorphism classes of belyi pairs and belyi graphs .",
    "the statement of the lemma follows from lemma [ gr ] since there is a one - to - one correspondence between grothendieck s dessins and belyi graphs .",
    "however , it can easily be established directly . to a belyi pair",
    "@xmath10 we associate the belyi graph @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the graph displayed on fig .  1 .",
    "vice versa , for a belyi graph @xmath29 there is a unique map @xmath30 sending the vertices and edges of @xmath29 to the vertices and edges of @xmath28 of the corresponding color . since both @xmath29 and @xmath28 are ribbon graphs ,",
    "this map can be extended to a toplogical cover @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a topological surface with punctures . lifting the complex structure from @xmath11 to @xmath32 by means of @xmath7 and filling in the punctures we get a belyi pair @xmath10 uniquely up to an isomorphism .",
    "we are interested in the weighted count of belyi graphs of given degree and genus . to be precise , by an automorphism of a belyi graph @xmath29 we understand a graph automorphism that respects the colors of vertices and edges .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 the automorphism group of @xmath29 and put @xmath34 where the sum is taken over all belyi graphs @xmath29 of degree @xmath13 and genus @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we derive a recursion that allows to compute the numbers @xmath35 relatively fast .",
    "note that this also solves the uniform ( i.  e. with all weights equal to @xmath3 ) enumeration problem for belyi graphs ( or grothendieck s dessins ) .",
    "a passage from the weighted count to the uniform count is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath10 be a belyi pair of genus @xmath12 and degree @xmath13 , and let @xmath29 be the corresponding belyi graph .",
    "put @xmath36 , and denote by @xmath37 $ ] the ramification profile of @xmath7 over @xmath1 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in terms of the belyi graph @xmath29 these quantities can be interpreted as follows : @xmath40 is the number of red - green cycles , @xmath41 is the number of green - blue cycles , and @xmath42 is the number of red - blue cycles of length @xmath43 ( i.e. consisting of @xmath44 red and @xmath44 blue edges ) .",
    "the triple @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , will be called here the _ type _ of the belyi graph @xmath29 , and the set of all belyi graphs of type @xmath45 will be denoted by @xmath47 .    in this section",
    "we are interested in the weighted count of belyi graphs of a given type .",
    "namely , put @xmath48 and consider the degree @xmath13 generating functions @xmath49 that can be combined into the total generating function @xmath50    the main technical statement of this note is the following    [ main ] put @xmath51 then the total generating function @xmath52 satisfies the non - linear evolution equation @xmath53 and is uniquely determined by the initial condition @xmath54 equivalently , the partition function @xmath55 is explicitly given by the formula @xmath56 ( here `` 1 '' stands for the constant function identically equal to 1 ) .",
    "let us first re - write eq .",
    "( [ pde ] ) as a recursion for the numbers @xmath57 .",
    "denote by @xmath58 the sequence with 1 at the @xmath59-th place and 0 elsewhere .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ pde ] ) is equivalent to @xmath60 we prove it by establishing a direct bijection between belyi graphs counted in the left and right hand sides of ( [ rec ] ) .",
    "we introduce two operations on belyi graphs that we call edge deletion and edge insertion . to perform an edge deletion",
    ", we erase a green edge together with red and blue half - edges incident to its endpoints and connect the remaining loose red and blue half - edges together .",
    "edge insertion is an operation inverse to edge deletion ( note that in order to keep track of a graph s type we can delete and insert only green edges ) .",
    "suppose that we start with a belyi graph @xmath29 of type @xmath61 .",
    "there are @xmath62 possibilities to pick a green edge in @xmath29",
    ". then the edge deletion results in one of the following 5 cases :    a.   a red - green double edge gets deleted , see fig .",
    "[ double ] , ( a ) .",
    "the graph type changes to @xmath63 , where @xmath44 is the number of red edges in the red - blue cycle of @xmath29 containing the deleted red edge .",
    "b.   a green - blue double edge gets deleted , see fig .",
    "[ double ] , ( b ) .",
    "the graph type changes to @xmath64 , where @xmath44 is the number of blue edges in the red - blue cycle of @xmath29 containing the deleted blue edge . +    c.   the green edge connects two red - blue cycles of lengths @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the edge deletion gives rise to one red - blue cycle of length @xmath67 , see fig .",
    "[ unite ] .",
    "the graph type changes to @xmath68 .",
    "+    d.   the green edge connects two vertices of the same red - blue cycle of length @xmath69 . after the edge deletion",
    "the cycle splits into two ones of lengths @xmath43 and @xmath66 while the graph remains connected , see fig .",
    "[ split ] .",
    "the graph type changes to @xmath70 .",
    "+    e.   the green edge connects two vertices of the same red - blue cycle of length @xmath69 .",
    "after the edge deletion the cycle splits into two ones of lengths @xmath43 and @xmath66 , but the graph gets disconnected .",
    "the types of connected components are @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    in order to prove ( [ rec ] ) we need to compute for each case the number of ways it occurs .",
    "for a belyi graph of type @xmath63 there are @xmath75 red - blue cycles of length @xmath67 .",
    "this gives @xmath76 possibilities to insert a red - green double edge into a blue edge belonging to one of the red - blue cycles of length @xmath67 .",
    "the same is true for graphs of type @xmath64 when we insert green - blue double edges into the red edges . that covers the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) and yields the first line in ( [ rec ] ) .    in cases",
    "( iii)-(v ) edge insertion amounts to picking a pair of edges , one red and one blue , cutting them in halves and connecting with a green edge . in case ( iii )",
    "we start with a belyi graph of type @xmath68 and count the number of pairs consisting of one red and one blue edge belonging to the same red - blue cycle of length @xmath67 such that the two complementary arcs have lengths @xmath65 and @xmath66 . clearly , this number is @xmath77 , that yields the second line in ( [ rec ] ) . in case ( iv ) for a belyi graph of type @xmath70 we pick a red edge in a red - blue cycle of length @xmath65 and a blue edge in a ( different ) red - blue cycle of length @xmath66 .",
    "the number of ways do this is @xmath78 that yields the third line in ( [ rec ] ) . in case ( v )",
    "we pick a red edge on one connected component and a blue edge on another one . for connected components of types @xmath71 and @xmath72 this can be done in @xmath79 ways , giving the last two lines in ( [ rec ] ) . for graphs with non - trivial automorphisms , edge insertions ( deletions )",
    "equivalent under the action of @xmath33 have the same effect , so such graphs should be counted with the factor @xmath80 .",
    "this completes the proof of ( [ rec ] ) , or , equivalently , ( [ pde ] ) .    to show that the total generating function @xmath81 is uniquely determined by the initial condition @xmath82",
    ", we first notice that @xmath83 ( for @xmath84 there is only one belyi graph @xmath28 , see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the equation ( [ pde ] ) recursively expresses @xmath85 in terms of @xmath86 as follows : @xmath87 therefore , @xmath88 is uniquely determined by ( [ ind ] ) for each @xmath89 . explicit formula ( [ par ] ) for the partition function @xmath90 is just another way of writing the same thing .",
    "here we discuss some consequences of theorem 1 .",
    "first , we notice that recursion ( [ ind ] ) provides a relatively fast algorithm for computing the numbers @xmath57 .",
    "we can use it to compute , for instance , the numbers @xmath35 of dessins of degree @xmath13 and genus @xmath12 :      we call a belyi graph _ marked _ if it has a distinguished ( labeled ) green edge . any automorphism of a ( connected ) marked belyi graph mapping the labeled green edge to itself is clearly identical . therefore ,",
    "the automorphism group of any connected marked belyi graph is trivial , and the number @xmath93 of marked belyi graphs of degree @xmath13 and genus @xmath12 must be an integer .",
    "the same is true for the numbers @xmath94 , where @xmath95 ( while @xmath57 is only rational in general , the number @xmath96 is always an integer ) .",
    "note that the numbers @xmath97 also enumerate rooted hypermaps of genus @xmath12 on @xmath13 darts , as well as subgroups of @xmath98 of index @xmath13 and genus @xmath12 .",
    "there are closed formulas for @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath101 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 the numbers @xmath97 were computed in @xcite , but essentially nothing has been known about @xmath97 for general @xmath13 and @xmath12 , cf .",
    "problem 3 in @xcite .",
    "we finish with an observation ( learned from kazarian @xcite ) that the generating function @xmath52 satisfies an infinite system of non - linear partial differential equations called the kp ( kadomtsev - petviashvili ) hierarchy ( this means that the numbers @xmath57 additionally obey an infinite system of recursions ) .",
    "the kp hierarchy is one of the best studied completely integrable systems in mathematical physics .",
    "below are the several first equations of the hierarchy :        the exponential @xmath55 of any solution is called a _ tau function _ of the hierarchy .",
    "the space of solutions ( or the space of tau functions ) has a nice geometric interpretation as an infinite - dimensional grassmannian ( called the _",
    "sato grassmannian _ ) , see , e.  g. , @xcite or @xcite for details . in particular , the space of solutions is homogeneous : there is a lie algebra @xmath107 ( a central extension of @xmath108 ) that acts infinitesimally on the space of solutions , and the action of the corresponding lie group is transitive .",
    "[ tau ] the generating function @xmath52 satisfies the infinite system of kp equations ( [ kp ] ) with respect to @xmath109 for any parameters @xmath110 .",
    "equivalently , the partition function @xmath55 is a 3-parameter family of kp tau functions .",
    "we make use of eq .",
    "( [ par ] ) . to begin with",
    ", we notice that @xmath3 is obviously a kp tau function .",
    "then , since @xmath111 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the linear combination @xmath112 also belongs to @xmath107 for any @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , the exponential @xmath113 preserves the sato grassmannian and maps kp tau functions to kp tau functions .",
    "thus , @xmath90 is a kp tau function as well , and @xmath81 is a solution to kp hierarchy .      * acknowledgements .",
