    "massive stars ( m @xmath7 @xmath8 ) are among the major contributors to the chemical enrichment of the galaxy through both their winds and core collapse supernova ( ccsn ) . in carbonaceous meteorites several types of c - rich presolar grains condensed in ccsn ejecta have been identified through association of the measured isotopic abundance patterns with signatures of such events ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among those , c - rich grains like type",
    "x silicon carbides ( sic - x ) and graphites are assumed to require a c - rich environment to form ( c / o @xmath9 1 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "standard massive star models predict that c - rich ejecta originate in explosive he shell burning , characterized by partial pre - explosive he - burning products ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the heavy species abundances show a mild @xmath10-process signature from pre - explosive convective he - shell burning ( triggered by the @xmath11ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath12 mg reaction , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and by the explosive neutron burst triggered again by the @xmath11ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath12 mg reaction ( namely the @xmath13-process , with n@xmath14 @xmath15 10@xmath16 @xmath17 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sic - x grains show a @xmath18si excess compared to @xmath19si , and most of these grains have a @xmath0c and @xmath20n excess while some show a @xmath21c and @xmath20n excess .",
    "the @xmath22 mg and @xmath5ca excess compared to solar has been explained by the condensation of unstable @xmath22al and @xmath5ti into the grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "graphite grains ( with low density , ld group , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show a large range of @xmath0c/@xmath21c ratio , possibly correlated with @xmath16o excess . both excess and deficit of @xmath18si with respect to @xmath19si can be observed .",
    "indication of @xmath22 mg and @xmath5ca excess is also found for several of those grains .",
    "finally , their measured @xmath23n/@xmath20n ratio with few exceptions is quite normal , pointing to a contamination from solar nitrogen ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . to explain these abundance signatures @xcite and @xcite assume mixing of he - shell matter with si / s zone material ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) deeper in the supernova without any mixing contribution from the o - rich layers in between .",
    "the main constraint is that the material out of which the grains form needs to be c - rich , to have free carbon to condense in sic and graphites after co formation . @xcite and references therein suggests instead that since sn ejecta are not in thermodynamic equilibrium , c - rich grains may condense in o - rich and @xmath18si - rich ejecta .",
    "more recently , @xcite found a deficit or normal @xmath24fe compared to @xmath25fe abundance in sic - x grains , in disagreement with nucleosynthesis predictions for the @xmath18si - rich si / s zone to be @xmath24fe - rich ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "possible fractionation between si and fe proposed by @xcite is unlikely to be sufficient , since fe - rich subgrains in the sic - x grains also show a normal @xmath24fe/@xmath25fe ratio . in this letter",
    "we propose a new nucleosynthesis scenario , where the observational signatures of c - rich presolar grains can be obtained , without mixing , from the c - rich material in ccsn that experience a strong shock .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : models_description ] we describe stellar models and the nucleosynthesis calculations , in  [ sec : comparison ] we compare theoretical results with measurements for sic x grains and graphite grains . finally in  [ sec : summary ] results are summarized .",

    "the pre - supernova evolution is computed with the stellar code genec ( see for more details * ? ? ? * model 15st in their fig.6 ) .",
    "the explosion simulations include the fallback prescription by @xcite , using the recommended initial shock velocity and reduced by a factor of 2 and 4 , respectively ( models 15r , 15r2 and 15r4 ) .",
    "the standard initial shock velocity used beyond fallback is @xmath28 . for a 15m@xmath29 star simulation by @xcite",
    ", a @xmath30 shock velocity corresponds to a @xmath31 explosion , a @xmath32 shock velocity corresponds to a @xmath33 explosion , and the @xmath34 shock velocity corresponds to a weak explosion below @xmath35 .",
    "the full nucleosynthesis is calculated using the post - processing code mppnp ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "here we focus only on c - rich explosive he burning ejecta which include the he / c zone and a small part of the o / c zone @xcite .",
    "compared to standard symmetric ccsn models with explosion energy of 10@xmath36 erg ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our models show that depending on the explosion energy @xmath3o is depleted and @xmath18si is accumulated at the bottom of the he / c zone and at the top of the c / o zone , where @xmath0c is not significantly modified ( see fig.[fig:15_spagh_he ] for the details of models 15r and 15r4 with the largest and smallest shock ) .",
    "such @xmath18si - enrichment is obtained also in the intermediate model 15r2 .",

    "@xmath39ne exceed the @xmath0c@xmath38-rate ( fig.[fig : rates_comp ] ) .",
    "the reaction rate is directly correlated with the s - factor .",
    "the rate is obtained by integrating the s - factor over the gamow window , the energy range of stellar burning at a certain temperature as defined by @xcite .",
    "the s - factor curve of @xmath0c(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3o is characterized by non - resonant reaction components : they primarily consist of interfering e1 transitions from tails of broad high energy 1@xmath40 resonances and the 1@xmath40 sub - threshold state , and a e2 direct capture component interfering with low energy tails of 2@xmath41 resonances and the subthreshold state @xcite . while at low temperatures the reaction rate is lower than @xmath3o(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath39ne , it declines towards higher temperatures because of the decline of the s - factor by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the @xmath3o(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath39ne reaction rate on the other hand is determined by a constant non - resonant s - factor term and by the narrow 3@xmath40 and 1@xmath40 resonances at 1.1 mev and 1.3 mev respectively , which dominate the reaction rate above temperatures of @xmath42 @xcite . concerning the reaction rates of the subsequent @xmath1-capture reactions @xmath39ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath43 mg @xcite and @xmath43mg(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath18si @xcite , the non - resonant s - factor terms are larger and",
    "the critical energy range above 0.3 mev is characterized by narrow resonances which cause a further enhancement in the reaction rate , as demonstrated for @xmath39ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath43 mg in fig.[fig : rates_comp ] .",
    "this is also true but for larger energies and to a smaller extent for the production of @xmath44s , @xmath45ar , @xmath6ca , and @xmath5ti .    in parts of the he / c and c / o zones , @xmath3o is thus depleted and feeds the production of @xmath18si .",
    "this zone is c and si rich , and therefore we call this zone the c / si zone . a fundamental condition required to form",
    "the c / si zone is that sufficient @xmath46he fuel is available while high enough temperatures are reached in the explosive burning . for model 15r , @xmath3o and @xmath39ne",
    "are depleted , whereas @xmath18si and @xmath44s are produced up to a mass fraction of @xmath15 20% in the c / si zone , due to reactions along the @xmath1-capture chain ( fig.[fig : rates_comp ] ) . as shown in fig.[fig:15_spagh_he ] , the @xmath1-capture chain is efficient up to @xmath5ti . at the bottom of the he",
    "/ c zone results are similar , but since the pre - explosive @xmath3o abundance is lower the production of @xmath18si and @xmath44s is less efficient .",
    "in this zone @xmath6ca is depleted via neutron captures , and unstable @xmath5ti is not produced . in model 15r4 the most produced species in the c / si zone are @xmath39ne , @xmath43 mg and @xmath18si . in comparison with the pre - explosive abundances ,",
    "the species above @xmath44s and along the @xmath1-chain are not produced efficiently .",
    "a similar but milder signature is obtained again at the bottom of the he / c zone .",
    "notice that the rapid decrease of @xmath1-particles in the o / c zones is causing a weaker o - depletion ( and @xmath18si - excess ) .",
    "before the sn explosion such a zone is radiative , still carrying the signature of the pre - explosive convective he - burning core .",
    "the he profile under the he shell depends on uncertain physics assumptions in the models .",
    "furthermore , @xmath47he may be mixed into the o / c zone from the bottom of the he shell by extra - mixing triggered by processes that have not been considered in our pre - sn model , such as rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or convective boundary mixing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in that case",
    "larger fractions of the o / c zone would be converted into the c / si zone compared to our model .    in summary , in the ccsn ejecta exposed to strong shocks",
    "the upper part of the c / o zone and an extended region of the he / c zone are @xmath3o - depleted and @xmath18si - rich , and @xmath18si will be present in c - rich material when grains will start to condense .",
    "in this section , the nucleosynthesis predictions described in  [ sec : models_description ] are compared with observations for single sic - x and graphite grains , from the st .",
    "louis presolar grains database @xcite .",
    "we compare @xmath48 the abundances from the c - rich region in the he shell ( namely , the c / si zone and the he / c zone ) .",
    "mildly c - rich regions in the he / n zone ( h - burning layer ) will be discussed in a future work . in fig.[fig : cn_co_ratio ] , left panel , c and n isotopic ratios for sic - x grains are shown compared to the abundances in c - rich material from our models .",
    "not included in the figure , ld graphites show a similar @xmath0c/@xmath21c spread compared to sic - x grains .",
    "the c / si zone and the bottom of the he / c zone show high @xmath0c/@xmath21c and low @xmath23n/@xmath20n .",
    "the carbon isotopic ratio is at least 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of the grains , due to lack of @xmath21c ( area labeled as `` si - rich '' in the plot ) .",
    "grains data are located in between our predictions and the solar ratios . some mixture with a normal component and/or with material from the external part of the he shell is required to fit the observations in this scenario . indeed ,",
    "in the most external part of the he / c zone ( the part that is not o - depleted ) the c ratio evolves to normal values , but with a n ratio larger than solar . notice that in fig.[fig : cn_co_ratio ] there is a group of sic - x grains showing @xmath0c/@xmath21c lower than solar .",
    "we will discuss them in a further work , where sn ejecta affected by h burning are considered . in fig.[fig",
    ": cn_co_ratio ] , we report the comparison with ld graphites for @xmath3o/@xmath16o , and again @xmath0c/@xmath21c . the largest measured @xmath16o excess is observed for few graphites with @xmath0c/@xmath21c larger than solar , in agreement with the abundance signature in the external part of the he / c zone . in the c / si zone and at the bottom of the he",
    "/ c zone the @xmath3o/@xmath16o becomes up to 7 - 8 orders of magnitude larger than solar .",
    "however , such a large ratio can be reduced to a ratio @xmath15 solar with minor mixing with normal material , since there is negligible amount of oxygen left in these layers ( see e.g. , fig.[fig:15_spagh_he ] ) .    in fig.[fig : sidelta_grains ] , right panels , the si isotopic ratio of stellar models and sic - x grains are compared .",
    "the same is done for ld graphites in the bottom left panel . in the upper left panel , the pre - explosive and post - explosive isotopic si abundances are reported for model 15r . during the explosion , in the c / o zone with low @xmath1-fuel available @xmath18si is marginally produced via @xmath1-capture , and @xmath19si are strongly produced via neutron capture .",
    "the c / si zone shows a strong @xmath18si production .",
    "in particular , in zone @xmath49 ( m = 2.95 m@xmath50 ) the pre - explosive temperature and density are @xmath51 and @xmath52 , rising up to @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively , during the explosion . moving outward in the the deepest part of the he / c zone , the @xmath13-process ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) gradually changes the @xmath18si - enrichment to strong @xmath19si - enrichments .",
    "less extreme si isotopic ratios with a mild @xmath19si - excess are seen in the external he / c zone , due to the pre - explosive @xmath10-processing .",
    "the @xmath18si - excess is reproduced in part of the c / si zone for models 15r and 15r2 ( see e.g. zone @xmath49 in model 15r , fig.[fig : sidelta_grains ] , upper left panel and right bottom panel ) . also in this case , the grains data shows @xmath55-values closer to the solar ratio , corresponding again to some mixing with unprocessed material , or with more external c - rich stellar layers . on the other hand , in model 15r4",
    "the shock temperature is not sufficient to reproduce the @xmath18si - excess observed in sic - x grains .",
    "the combined nucleosynthesis contribution from @xmath1-captures and neutron captures cause a milder @xmath18si/@xmath56si - enrichment compared to @xmath18si/@xmath57si moving outward in the @xmath18si - rich regions , and an earlier positive @xmath55(@xmath56si ) with decreasing temperature compared to @xmath55(@xmath57si ) .",
    "this trend is consistent with a subset of sic - x grains , whereas most of the sic - x grains belong to the group x1 @xcite .    finally , in fig.[fig : sidelta_grains ] , left bottom panel , ld graphites show a relevant amount of grains with @xmath18si excess , but with many scattered around the solar ratios , and few with positive si @xmath55 ratios .",
    "this different behavior between sic - x grains and graphites is qualitatively explained looking at the profile of si isotopes in model 15r ( fig.[fig : sidelta_grains ] , left upper panel ) .",
    "the efficiency of graphite condensation depends on the c enrichment only , whereas sic - x grains depend on both the c and si inventory . therefore , sic - x condensation will be more efficient in the c / si zone than in the he / c zone , whereas constraints for graphites are less severe .",
    "we may also expect that the condensation of sic - x and graphites will be less efficient in the external part of the he / c zone , compared to the c - rich and o - depleted regions .",
    "indeed , in these stellar layers there is less free c and si available .",
    "simulations of the condensation processes using present abundance predictions are required to better quantify this analysis .",
    "the initial @xmath5ti and @xmath22al enrichment are distinctive signatures for a significant fraction of sic - x grains and ld graphites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "their initial amount that condenses into the grains is usually estimated assuming that the @xmath5ca/@xmath6ca and @xmath22mg/@xmath43 mg ratios are solar .",
    "this is not the case in our calculations ( see e.g. @xmath6ca abundance profile in fig.[fig:15_spagh_he ] ) .",
    "furthermore , al and ti condense more efficiently than mg and ca , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for model 15r ,",
    "the thermodynamic conditions allow to produce @xmath6ca and @xmath5ti at the same time , with @xmath5ti/@xmath6ca @xmath15 10@xmath58 ( fig.[fig:15_spagh_he ] ) .",
    "the largest measured @xmath5ca/@xmath6ca ratio in sic - x grains of @xmath15 2 - 3 @xcite , would be satisfied with a fractionation ti / ca @xmath15 100 without considering also direct @xmath5ca production . in the he",
    "/ c zone , the neutron captures deplete the pre - explosive @xmath6ca by orders of magnitude , eventually leading to high @xmath5ca/@xmath6ca and high @xmath59ca/@xmath6ca .",
    "@xmath59ti is depleted in this case .",
    "we notice that in measurements by e.g. @xcite @xmath59ca and @xmath59ti were not possible to distinguish . for model 15r4 ,",
    "the abundances in the c / si zone are less extreme than model 15r , with a nucleosynthesis more similar to the he / c zone .",
    "one of the main puzzles for the previous ad - hoc mixing scenarios for sic - x grains is the non - enhancement of @xmath24fe compared to @xmath25fe , since in standard ccsn models @xmath18si - rich zones are also @xmath24fe - rich . in the c / si zone of our models fe",
    "species are destroyed by neutron captures and grain signatures with low @xmath24fe are predicted .",
    "the isotopes @xmath60fe can also be produced outward in the he / c zone .",
    "we have compared the abundance signature in presolar sic - x grains and ld graphites with nucleosynthesis predictions from ccsn ejecta exposed to high shock velocities . due to basic nuclear properties ,",
    "an @xmath1-capture chain starts from @xmath3o feeding heavier species including @xmath18si , without affecting the pre - explosive abundance of @xmath0c and creating a new c / si zone .",
    "the amount and distribution of @xmath1-isotopes mainly depend on the abundance of the seed @xmath3o , on the explosion shock velocity and on the amount of @xmath1-particles available .",
    "the interplay between the @xmath1-captures and the @xmath13-process regulates the relative abundances of @xmath61si in the he / c zone .    the typical isotopic trends for c , n , and o of ld graphites and sic - x grains can be reproduced using the c - rich ejecta , with the exception of grains with low @xmath0c/@xmath21c .",
    "the observed @xmath18si - excess is explained qualitatively from the signature in the c / si zone , where @xmath3o has been depleted by following @xmath1-captures to build @xmath18si and other heavier species . since production of graphites depends only on the c abundance , and sic - x on both c and si",
    ", this may explain why the @xmath18si - excess is not observed in all ld graphites .",
    "therefore , the c / si zone is an ideal environment to condense sic - x and ld graphites .",
    "such abundance signatures triggered by high temperatures can be also obtained in parts of asymmetric ccsn ejecta exposed to high shock velocities , or in hypernovae ejecta .",
    "we reconsidered the @xmath5ti - excess extrapolated from a sample of c - rich presolar grains . in the c / si zone",
    "the @xmath5ca/@xmath6ca is not solar , affecting the results of such extrapolation .",
    "the ca and ti condensation efficiency is uncertain , leading to their elemental fractionation . for the model with largest explosion energy ( model 15r ) both @xmath6ca and @xmath5ti ( and @xmath59ti )",
    "are produced in the c / si zone ( with @xmath6ca/@xmath5ti @xmath15 100 ) .",
    "neutron captures destroy @xmath6ca in the he / c zone .",
    "the isotope @xmath5ca ( and @xmath59ca ) instead is produced by neutron captures in all the o - depleted and c - rich ejecta . for weaker shocks ( see e.g. , model 15r4 ) neutron captures dominate the ca nucleosynthesis , @xmath6ca is depleted and @xmath5ca produced . in both cases , a comparison needs to be made grain - by - grain , where correlations with e.g. , ti species and @xmath18si - excess ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are considered .",
    "a similar discussion can be derived for @xmath22al enrichment . finally , the present results provide support to the existence of different energy components in the ejecta of the same ccsn .",
    "asymmetries during the sn explosion of e.g. , sn1987a and casa are confirmed by observations . in sn1987a the emission sii and fei - ii from core material",
    "are correlated with hei emission , possibly indicating the signature of @xmath1-rich freezout during high - energy - sn explosion in at least part of the ejecta @xcite . in casa , @xcite reported two major velocity components for siii in the ejecta .",
    "we suggest that they may be the signature of the si / s - si / o and c / si zones , respectively .",
    "this scenario would also explain the non - correlation between neii and oiv emission in casa @xcite .",
    "indeed , ne ( together with mg , s , ar and ca ) could be produced also in the c / si zone , whereas for standard ccsn o and ne are produced in the same regions .",
