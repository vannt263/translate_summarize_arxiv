    "when set in motion through vibration or shear , granular materials have a strong tendency to segregate into bands containing particles of similar size , shape , or density @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on shear - induced segregation by size , which appears in a variety of configurations and applications , including avalanches @xcite , rotating tumblers @xcite , and internal shear experiments @xcite .    continuum models of avalanche flow have been derived using ideas from shallow water theory , in which a thin - layer approximation captures both the free surface shape and the underlying depth - averaged velocity @xcite .",
    "these models typically do not account for segregation .",
    "however , segregation in avalanching flows has been modeled by a mass transport equation alone , in which a roughly constant shear rate is specified @xcite . here , we adapt a mass transport segregation model to situations where the shear rate is far from constant , reflecting the nonlinear dependence of the velocity of particles on position , as is commonly the case for boundary - driven flows @xcite . through experiments on a mixture of two particle sizes within an annular shear cell",
    ", we measure the velocity profile and incorporate the resulting spatially - dependent shear rate into the constitutive law of the model .",
    "the gray - thornton model @xcite for segregation by size in an avalanche containing two species of particles with similar density but different size , takes the form [ basic_pde ] _ t+u(z)_x+(w(,z))_z=0 . in this partial differential equation ( pde )",
    ", @xmath0 represents the concentration ( fraction by volume ) of smaller particles as a function of the distance down the avalanche @xmath1 , distance @xmath2 above the base and time @xmath3 .",
    "the bulk flow is represented by the velocity @xmath4 parallel to the base ; the normal velocity @xmath5 of small particles is due to segregation dynamics .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are assumed to be known functions whose functional forms are deduced as part of the model derivation . in avalanche flow , @xmath4 is roughly linear near the surface @xcite , so that the shear rate @xmath6 is close to constant , and @xmath7 for positive , constant @xmath8 proportional to the constant shear rate .",
    "thus , in the gray - thornton model , the segregation rate is independent of depth .",
    "note that @xmath9 is the concentration of large particles , so that this form for @xmath5 may be considered to represent the availability of large voids created by relative motion of large particles .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the influence of non - uniform shear rate @xmath6 , for which the segregation rate will be different at different depths . for example , if there is no shear , then there should be no tendency towards segregation , whereas a large shear rate should induce rapid segregation .",
    "our model fits into the general framework of equation ( [ basic_pde ] ) , but the normal speed @xmath10 of small particles depends on @xmath2 through the depth - dependence of the shear rate @xmath6 . in our model , we assume that @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath6 . in principle , @xmath10 could be any increasing function of shear rate .    to simplify matters in both the experiment and the model , we begin with a bidisperse granular material in which the two sizes of particles ( with the same density ) are arranged in a one - dimensional configuration , as shown in fig .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that in the subsequent evolution from this normally - graded configuration to an inverse - graded configuration , the concentration of each size of particle at each location depends only on depth and time .",
    "we explore two pde models , both motivated by the structure of the velocity profile taken from experimental observations and differing only in the choice of depth - dependent shear rates chosen to approximate the experimental results .        the general form of the pde ( [ basic_pde ] ) we consider is the conservation law [ pde1 ] _",

    "an upper heavy confining plate is allowed to move vertically to accommodate changes in volume , due to both reynolds dilatancy @xcite and changes in packing density arising from the mixing / segregation process @xcite .",
    "the particles initially mix and then re - segregate through a process known as _ kinetic sieving _ : as the shearing proceeds , large particles roll and slide over one another , opening up gaps for the smaller particles to fall into .",

    "this approximation is suitable for free - surface avalanches , where shearing is provided by the effect of gravity , a body force .",

    "we begin the analysis of case  ii by considering general functions @xmath14 that are smooth , positive and decreasing , but it turns out that the choice of the exponential form is particularly useful for calculating explicit solutions .",

    "the apparatus has a window in the outer wall , permitting us to track particle positions over time with a high speed ( 450 hz ) digital camera .",

    "* velocities reach steady - state after a short initial transient of approximately @xmath48 , where @xmath49  seconds is the duration of the experiment .",
    "this observation justifies the use of a time - independent velocity profile @xmath4 in the model .      to obtain the position - dependence of the shear rate from the measured velocity profile ,",

    "we employ a linear transformation to ensure that @xmath29 and @xmath27 correspond to the top of the lower boundary layer and the bottom of the upper boundary layer , respectively .",
    "we limit our modeling to @xmath52 $ ] since we are interested in the bulk behavior of the system .",
    "we also normalize the velocity so that @xmath53 since there is no data point at @xmath54 we calculate the line containing the points @xmath55 and @xmath56 which span @xmath29 , and use the velocity value associated with @xmath29 on that line to normalize the velocity data ( see fig .  [ vp ] ) . note that the velocity of the bottom plate sets an overall timescale that is necessary to make a full comparison between predictions of the model and the observed segregation in the experiment .",
    "however , in this paper we consider only a comparison between the theoretical predictions of case  i and case  ii , using the experiment solely to provide physically realistic shear rate parameters .    in fig .",

    "for comparison , we can use @xmath65 to generate the corresponding piecewise linear fit to the measured velocity profile ; this is shown by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "these three parameter values are used with the constructions of  [ ibvp ] to generate the solution in case  i shown in fig .  [ solutions](a ) .",
    "the measured velocity profile in the region @xmath66 is also well - described by an exponential function @xmath67 , as shown in fig .",

    "full segregation is never achieved in the experiment , making it impossible to identify a final time @xmath31 to compare with the models . to measure the progress of segregation in the experiment , we record the height of the top plate and relate the total volume of the sample to the degree of mixing / segregation .",
    "because we observe that the volume approaches its final value only exponentially in time , we conjecture that isolated large particles remain trapped at the bottom and migrate upward on a slower timescale .",
    "this is a discrete effect not captured by a continuum model .",
    "the model does not account for three - dimensional motion of the particles .",
    "while the assumption that the concentration of large and small particles depends only on depth is clearly unrealistic , @xmath24 might be considered reasonable as an average across horizontal layers of particles .",
    "the side walls of the experiment undoubtedly influence the dynamics , since they introduce lateral shear",
    ". it would be possible to include this effect in a multidimensional model , but verifying such a model with experiments would be hampered by the difficulty of tracking particles within the bulk .",
    "finally , we note that the piecewise constant case ( case  i ) has been studied both theoretically and numerically in various contexts , for example in flow in porous media composed of layers of different material such as sand and clay , and in connection with sedimentation @xcite . in these studies , a variety of techniques are introduced for studying entropy conditions and special solutions , as well as analysis of existence and uniqueness questions .",
    "our application to segregation solves a special initial boundary value problem , but it reveals the unforeseen consequence that the material interface at @xmath17 removes the influence of the lower portion @xmath230 of the domain on the overall time scale of the evolution .",
