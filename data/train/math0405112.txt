    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have generated considerable excitement in the physics community both because their study allows one to explore new regimes of fundamental physics and because of their eventual engineering applications .",
    "they constitute a macroscopic quantum phenomenon , and their analysis has already lead to an increased understanding of phenomena such as superfluidity and superconductivity .",
    "of particular interest are becs in optical lattices ( periodic potentials ) , which have already been used to study josephson effects @xcite , squeezed states @xcite , landau - zener tunneling and bloch oscillations @xcite , and the transition between superfluidity and mott insulation @xcite . with each lattice site occupied by one alkali atom in its ground state , becs in periodic potentials",
    "also show promise as registers for quantum computers @xcite .",
    "* _ authors note : we rephrased the next paragraph . _",
    "*    in the present paper , we generalize recent work on near - autonomous dynamics in becs @xcite to study quasiperiodic behavior in becs in periodic lattices , which can have shallow , intermediate , or deep wells .",
    "we present our methodology and results in section [ results ] . in section [ setup ] , we discuss the physics of becs and use a coherent structure ansatz to derive a parametrically forced duffing oscillator describing the spatial dynamics of the condensate .",
    "the quasiperiodic dynamics of parametrically forced duffing oscillators is rigorously investigated in section [ main ] .",
    "sections [ lattice ] and [ superlattice ] then describe applications to becs in periodic lattices and periodic superlattices , respectively . the kam theorem used in this analysis",
    "is proven in section [ s : proof ] . finally , we summarize and discuss our results in section [ conc ] .      * _ authors note : we rephrased the paragraph below .",
    "_ *    the spatial dynamics of standing waves in becs in periodic optical lattices can be described by a parametrically forced duffing equation , where the periodic forcing is given by an external potential due to the lattice @xcite .",
    "this gives a @xmath0 degree of freedom hamiltonian system .",
    "we use kam theory and aubry - mather theory to study its quasiperiodic dynamics .",
    "previous kam studies in becs took a heuristic approach and considered only near - autonomous situations @xcite .",
    "the approach of this paper , however , is especially versatile in that shallow , deep , and intermediate lattice wells can all be considered using the same mathematical framework . that is",
    ", we consider the near - autonomous and far - from - autonomous settings simultaneously .",
    "theorem [ t : main ] proves that for any ( analytic ) external periodic potential , any negative two - body scattering length , and any chemical potential , one obtains mostly 2-quasiperiodic dynamics for condensate wave functions of sufficiently large amplitude , where the minimal amplitude depends on the experimentally adjustable bec parameters .",
    "in particular , the threshold amplitude is proportional to the reciprocal of the square root of the scattering length .",
    "any 2-quasiperiodic wave function above the threshold has one fixed frequency and one proportional to its amplitude .",
    "we also demonstrate numerically that one obtains the same dynamical picture for lattices of all depths , as an increase in lattice amplitude essentially only affects scaling in phase space .",
    "these numerical results support the theoretically predicted scaling of the threshold amplitude .",
    "our theorem applies to periodic superlattices with an arbitrary number of rationally dependent wave numbers .",
    "the system we investigate is given by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the amplitude of the wave function , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are conjugate variables , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the function @xmath7 is a polynomial in @xmath3 and 1-periodic in @xmath8 .",
    "we also consider its poincar map , defined to be the return map on the section @xmath9 .",
    "one can show that such systems have invariant tori sufficiently far from the origin @xmath10 even when they are far from autonomous ( that is , even when @xmath11 is a large perturbation of an @xmath8-independent system ) . in the present case , this implies the existence of invariant tori for any optical lattice depth .",
    "the key condition is that @xmath12 as @xmath13 , as this guarantees that the set of frequencies corresponding to rotation around the origin is unbounded ; indeed , the frequency goes to infinity with the distance to the origin .",
    "the first result of this type can be found in the equivalent context of adiabatic theory @xcite .",

    "if the diophantine condition is relaxed to include a nonzero measure of frequencies , then one can similarly show that the region outside the innermost invariant torus contains a set of invariant tori of positive measure , where the measure converges exponentially fast to full measure as @xmath173 .",
    "the remaining dynamics in this region is presumably chaotic , but due to the low dimension of the system , there can not be any arnold diffusion .",
    "thus , it is at worst bounded chaos . among many papers on this subject ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite for further details .",
    "by contrast , the region on the inside seems to exhibit chaotic dynamics , as can be seen in figures [ p : pp1 ]  [ p : pp3 ] . in the near - autonomous",
    "setting ( i.e. , for small - amplitude @xmath47 ) , the figures show large domains of integrable dynamics in the interior region .",
    "a perturbation analysis for a similar system shows that , as the amplitude of @xmath47 goes to infinity , the sizes of these islands vanish , but their number increases reciprocally , so that an integrable set of measure @xmath17 remains @xcite .    in the next two sections , we consider potentials @xmath49 with one and two wave numbers .",
    "the former case describes becs in periodic lattices @xcite , and the latter case , which is now experimentally accessible @xcite , describes becs in periodic superlattices @xcite .",

    "the first rescaling ( [ e : s1 ] ) shows that decreasing @xmath197 increases the nonintegrable perturbation by a square law .",
    "intuitively , a large lattice wave number @xmath197 implies that the poincar map corresponds to short-``time '' integration in @xmath179 and is thus `` near '' the vector field . with @xmath197",

    "one obtains qualitatively similar results for other values of the lattice depth @xmath15 if the wave number @xmath197 is rescaled , as indicated above .",
    "as remarked previously , the phase space in these phase portraits is divided into two clearly distinct regions : an outer one in which the dynamics consists in large measure of invariant circles and cantor - like aubry - mather sets ( that wind around the origin at large distance ) and an inner one in which the dynamics is mostly chaotic .",

    "<S> , we apply a coherent structure ansatz to the gross - pitaevskii equation to obtain a parametrically forced duffing equation describing the spatial dynamics of the condensate . for shallow - well , intermediate - well , and deep - well potentials , we find kam tori and aubry - mather sets to prove that one obtains mostly quasiperiodic dynamics for condensate wave functions of sufficiently large amplitude , where the minimal amplitude depends on the experimentally adjustable bec parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this threshold scales with the square root of the inverse of the two - body scattering length , whereas the rotation number of tori above this threshold is proportional to the amplitude . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the same dynamical picture for lattices of all depths , as an increase in depth essentially only affects scaling in phase space . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is applicable to periodic superlattices with an arbitrary number of rationally dependent wave numbers .    </S>",
