    "in addition to fluorescent emission powered by photoionization , other mechanisms include emission from material shocked by radio - jets or starburst outflows or ly@xmath0  cooling radiation from gravitational collapse .",
    "the same set of physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the analogous ly@xmath0  nebulae observed around a subset of luminous radio galaxies @xcite , as well as the recently discovered ly@xmath0  ` blobs ' @xcite .",
    "the primary difference between the extended `` fuzz '' around quasars as compared to the nebulae around radio galaxies and ly@xmath0blobs is that a luminous quasar and hence the source of ionizing photons is directly detected in the former but not in the latter .",

    "this explanation is plausible considering that the large energies in the jets @xmath8erg ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this model is a good representation of the data except for the flux in the core of the ly@xmath0  profile .",
    "because the metal - line transitions and the ly@xmath19  data imply a damped ly@xmath0  system , we are highly confident that the emission at @xmath23  is not quasar continuum flux , but instead corresponds to line emission from another source .",
    "the sdss fiber spectra are spatially incoherent and only indicate that the source of emission is within the 3@xmath24-diameter fiber .",

    "we have discovered a ly@xmath0  blob associated with a pdla system at @xmath43 .",

    "we may place a lower limit on the star - formation rate of @xmath44 using the @xcite relation @xmath45 and the case b recombination value of the ratio @xmath46 .",

    "we estimate @xmath61 , by combining the sdss optical photometry of the quasar  with the assumed power - law spectral shape .",
    "the fluorescent surface brightness is given by @xmath62 , so we arrive at an estimate for the distance @xmath63 adopting the measured ly@xmath0  flux .",
    "the maximum possible distance is @xmath64 because we have assumed ( i ) the fluorescent emission fills the entire @xmath52 sdss fiber , and ( ii ) we have assumed a ` full moon ' configuration ( front - side illuminated ) where our scenario is more likely to approach a ` new moon ' ( back - side ) illumination pattern .",
    "we will address this latter issue in greater detail below .",
    "intriguingly , the above distance estimate of a few hundred kpc matches the upper limit on the gas distance implied by the observed column density , if we assume the quasar is photoionizing the outer layers of the pdla system .",
    "this is the most likely origin because the extragalactic uv background and local sources are too weak or too soft to yield such a large n@xmath65 column density and is very rarely observed in dla systems ( fox et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "we have estimated the distance of the quasar from the pdla system by performing a series of calculations with the cloudy software package ( v.6.0.2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assuming a plane - parallel slab of gas with @xmath66 , metallicity [ n / h ]  @xmath67 , and a range of ionization parameters @xmath68 . to match the observed equivalent width , we require @xmath69 and , therefore , an upper limit to the separation between the quasar and dla of @xmath70 . we draw two important conclusions : ( 1 )",
    "the gas is located within approximately 1mpc of the quasar ; ( 2 ) the majority of pdla systems lying within 1mpc of the quasar should also show significant absorption .",
    "we explore the fluorescence scenario further by performing the following numerical simulation .",
    "the pdla system is modeled as a singular isothermal sphere within a halo of @xmath71 , for which 5% of the mass is assumed to be in gas .",
    "the system is placed between the observer and the quasar with a distance 300kpc to the quasar such that the pdla s backside is illuminated by the quasar .",
    "we use the code developed in ( * ? ? ?",

    "2005 ) to perform the self - shielding calculation , solving for the ionization structure of the gas , the recombination rate , and the resulting ly@xmath0luminosity .",
    "the radiative transfer of the fluorescent ly@xmath0  photons is solved with a monte carlo method @xcite . in turn , we produce a map of the expected ly@xmath0  surface - brightness as shown in figure  [ fig : theory ] .",
    "we have extracted several one - dimensional spectra from this surface - brightness image to illustrate the flux level and the expected emission line profiles .",
    "although the one - dimensional spectrum through the @xmath72 sdss fiber aperture has roughly the observed line width , it has an integrated flux that is several orders of magnitude lower than observed .",
    "the low flux results from the fact that we are observing the illuminated galaxy in a ` new moon ' configuration ; the optically thick regions which give rise to the ly@xmath0  emission also serve to shield the radiation from our vantage point .",
    "the observed flux is instead dominated by the outer regions of fiber which cover optically thin regions of gas in the halo surrounding the galaxy ( aperture a2 in figure  [ fig : theory ] ) .",

    "the velocity widths of this extended emission can be as large as @xmath74  km  s@xmath26 consistent with our observed kinematic profile .",
    "the physical mechanism responsible for this emission could be fluorescent recombination radiation from gas in the quasar host halo illuminated by quasar s large ionizing flux @xcite .",
    "it is important to explain the distinction between the fluorescent ly@xmath0  fuzz as it occurs in the quasar host halo to the fluorescence from the dla galaxy which was considered in the previous section . for the former case",
    "the emission is presumed to be coming from small dense self - shielding clouds which permeate the quasar halo but have a small @xmath75 covering factor @xcite deduced from the fraction of the ionizing continuum which is being absorbed @xcite . in the latter case , where a galaxy is illuminated",
    ", the emission comes from a large , kpc - scale self - shielding cloud and a large fraction @xmath76 of the impingent ionizing continuum is converted into ly@xmath0  recombination photons .",
    "but the mechanism powering the extended emission line ` fuzz ' could be among other mechanisms put forth to explain the extended ly@xmath0  halos around quasars ly@xmath0  blobs , and high - redshift radio galaxies , such as gas shock - heated by a large scale outflow or cooling radiation from gravitational infall ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    in the halo fuzz scenario ,",
    "the dla - galaxy is in the foreground of the extended ly@xmath0  emitting region of the quasar host , and should hence absorb the fraction of the ly@xmath0  emission which it covers .",
    "this configuration also offers a reasonable explanation for why pdlas might preferentially exhibit ly@xmath0  emission relative to intervening dlas : the presence of a pdla occults the bright quasar making it much easier to detect faint extended emission from the quasar halo .",

    "the thing that makes the extended emission from  unique is that it coincides with a proximate damped ly@xmath0  system .",

    "specifically , h@xmath19 lies in a relatively clear transmission window near 2  microns as does h@xmath77 near 1.8  microns .",
    "the relative flux of these balmer lines to ly@xmath0  is sensitive to the amount of dust extinction , the hardness of the photoionizing spectrum , and resonant scattering of the ly@xmath0  photons .",
    "these balmer line ratios could thus further distinguish between the emission mechanisms discussed in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] .",
    "furthermore , the detection of high excitation lines , most notably , , or [ ]  1640 would demand that the nebula is powered by a hard spectrum , because a stellar continuum is too soft to produce strong emission in these lines .",
    "the coincidence of a damped ly@xmath0  system and a quasar ( pdla ) provide unique opportunities for future research .",
    "a pdla acts like a natural coronagraph in the core of the damped ly@xmath0  absorber , blocking the background quasar s bright ly@xmath0  emission and allowing one to conduct a sensitive search for diffuse extended fuzz from the quasar , albeit in a relatively narrow spectral window ( @xmath78 ) . at the faintest flux levels ,",
    "star - formation from the pdla galaxy and/or the quasar host galaxy could contribute to the detected emission , but for very bright ly@xmath0  emission as in  it is very unlikely that star - formation contributes significantly .    because the bright ly@xmath0  nebula likely originates in the quasar host halo , and hence behind the pdla",

    "the size of this hole would thus indicate the extent of the lower column density ` halo ' of the pdla , and a seeing - limited , integral field unit ( or narrow band ) observation would be sensitive to sizes of 5kpc and greater . at present , the only other means of assessing the size of absorption line systems is by observing coincident absorption in close quasar pairs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these observations were probably too shallow to rule out the detection of the pdlas ly@xmath0shadow . furthermore , for phl  1222 the significant contamination from quasar ly@xmath0  emission would have made the detection of a shadow even more difficult .",
