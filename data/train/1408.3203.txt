    "the entropy of a surface is proportional to its area .",
    "this is a mysterious truth which appears in several different contexts .",
    "the first context in which this was noticed is black hole thermodynamics . there , it was observed that black holes in classical general relativity obey various laws of thermodynamics so long as they are assigned an entropy proportional to the area of their event horizon : @xmath0 .",
    "for example , hawking s area law @xcite shows that @xmath1 is nondecreasing with time , in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "however , there are also quantum corrections to the area theorem  hawking radiation implies that black holes are intrinsically quantum objects , and therefore their entropy can not be entirely described by classical geometry . in the semiclassical setting , the black hole entropy is given by the so - called `` generalized entropy '' of the event horizon : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the expectation value of the area operator on a spatial slice @xmath4 of the horizon , and @xmath5 is the von neumann entropy @xmath6 for the state @xmath7 of matter fields outside the black hole ( e.g. stars or hawking radiation ) . at leading order in @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the generalized entropy obeys the generalized second law ( gsl ) , which states that @xmath10 is non - decreasing with time @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath5 includes a divergent component due to the vacuum entanglement entropy of short - wavelength modes across the horizon .",
    "it is a standard result in quantum field theory that the leading - order divergence is in itself proportional to the area @xcite and corresponds to a renormalization of newton s constant @xcite .",
    "there are also various subleading divergences extensive on the horizon .",
    "these divergences must be absorbed into counterterms , including various subleading quantum corrections to @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the area term is thus merely the dominant `` classical '' contribution to the entropy .",
    "a second context in which the entropy - area relation arises is via ads / cft .",
    "ads / cft , or gauge / gravity duality , is a correspondence between string theories in asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) bulk spacetimes and certain conformal gauge theories ( cft s ) living on the conformal boundary @xcite . in the limit where the cft is strongly coupled and has a large number @xmath12 of colors ,",
    "the bulk theory becomes classical general relativity , coupled to certain matter fields obeying the null energy condition .    in this classical limit",
    ", there is strong evidence that the entanglement entropy of a region @xmath13 in the cft can be computed from a spacelike , codimension 2 extremal surface @xmath14 such that @xmath15 and @xmath14 is homologous to @xmath13 , as proposed by hubeny , rangamani , and takayanagi ( hrt ) @xcite . when the spacetime is static , so that there is a preferred time foliation , the extremal surface is minimal on a constant time slice @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy of a region @xmath13 in the cft is then proportional to the area of the surface in the bulk @xmath16 .",
    "given some reasonable assumptions , this formula was recently proven by lewkowycz and maldacena ( lm ) @xcite .    in complete analogy with black hole thermodynamics , this result is only valid at @xmath17 , or equivalently @xmath18 in the cft .",
    "the first quantum corrections to this formula were computed , at order @xmath19 ( boundary ) or @xmath20 ( bulk ) , by faulkner , lewkowycz , and maldacena ( flm ) ; see also @xcite .",

    "( flm assumed the geometry was static , but we will assume in what follows that everything carries over to the nonstatic case if @xmath14 is an extremal surface . ) since flm restrict their attention to a context in which the total state is pure , @xmath5 and @xmath22 are interchangeable .    the similarity of eq",

    "in fact we can define @xmath23 more generally on a very broad class of surfaces .",
    "although it is tempting to call @xmath23 of the horizon `` _ _ the _ _ black hole entropy '' , in fact there are many possible surfaces one could choose on any given spacetime background , and these surfaces may also have a statistical interpretation @xcite .",
    "the only necessary ingredient is an entangling surface @xmath24 , defined as any spacelike codimension 2 surface which divides a cauchy surface @xmath25 into two pieces .",
    "let @xmath26 be that side of @xmath25 which is outside @xmath24 , and let @xmath27 be the side which is inside @xmath24 .",
    "we can then define @xmath28 as the entanglement entropy in the spatial region @xmath26 , and take @xmath10 as in eq .",

    "the generalized entropy can be defined with respect to either side , depending on whether we pick @xmath31 or @xmath32 to calculate @xmath10 . in the case where the state is pure , the choices yield identical results .",

    "for purposes of the flm formula , it seems clear that one should choose the entropy @xmath35 which lies on the _ same side _ as the region @xmath13 whose boundary entropy is of interest .",
    "choosing the other side would violate locality , since throwing a mixed qubit into the bulk from the complementary boundary region @xmath36 would immediately affect @xmath37 , which is unphysical .",
    "note that in an abuse of notation , we shall use the term entanglement entropy to refer to the entropy of both pure and mixed states .",
    "having observed that the generalized entropy can be defined for arbitrary surfaces , we now propose a modification to the flm formula  besides extending to extremal surfaces in non - static spacetimes  namely , that instead of a ) extremizing the area and then adding @xmath5 as flm did , in the entropy .",

    "] one should instead b ) extremize the total generalized entropy @xmath23 .",
    "we will call such a surface a _ quantum extremal surface _ since it is a quantum deformation of the usual notion of an extremal surface , in which one extremizes the area .",
    "it will be shown below that prescriptions ( a ) and ( b ) are equivalent at the order of the first quantum corrections ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "since this was the order of the flm proof , it does not distinguish which of ( a ) or ( b ) is correct at higher order . at higher , potentially infinite order in @xmath8",
    ", we will argue that ( a ) is not invariant under boundary unitary transformations and is therefore not the entanglement entropy .",
    "furthermore , we will prove several suggestive theorems about ( b ) , which do not hold for ( a ) .",
    "this gives us confidence that the prescription ( b ) is correct , and that quantum extremal surfaces are connected to key physical properties of quantum spacetimes .",
    "the quantum results we will present all have analogues in classical general relativity , for classical extremal surfaces . some of these results are needed for the consistency of the holographic entropy conjecture ; others are useful for identifying the regions of spacetimes probed by the extremal surfaces .    in particular , quantum extremal surfaces , like their classical counterparts ,",
    "are constrained to lie further into the bulk than the causal surface . in the classical case",
    ", it is known that the extremal surfaces @xmath38 do not intersect the causal wedge @xmath39 associated with the domain of dependence @xmath40 of a boundary region @xmath13 , on any spacetime obeying the null energy condition @xcite .",
    "in fact it lies deeper into the bulk in a spacelike direction , so that it can not even intersect the domain of influence @xmath41 ; the same holds for the extremal surface anchored to the complement of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we will show that these results continue to hold for quantum extremal surfaces in the perturbative quantum gravity regime , even though the null energy condition is no longer satisfied ! as a consequence , it follows that no bulk signals sent in from @xmath40 can change the spacetime behind the quantum extremal surface , so long as the bulk signals propagate locally .",
    "this is true even if one uses time folds to create signals located outside of the causal wedge , as in the shenker - stanford construction @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are also bounds limiting the reach of classical extremal surfaces . for example , in @xcite , we showed that spacelike extremal surfaces can not propagate past any codimension 1 surface with negative extrinsic curvature ( assuming that the extremal surfaces can be deformed continuously so as to lie outside ) .",
    "it turns out that a perturbatively quantum spacetime features analogous `` barrier surfaces '' : any null surface on which the generalized entropy is non - increasing is an obstacle for quantum extremal surfaces .",
    "these results place limits on certain methods of bulk reconstruction in ads / cft .",
    "we will show that the bulk region behind a quantum extremal surface @xmath42 can not be accessed from @xmath13 by any of the types of boundary observables we consider , namely entanglement entropy and local causal signals .",

    "section [ ee ] details our prescription for computing holographic entanglement entropy , including some consistency checks and comparison to the flm formula . in section",
    "[ reach ] , we prove that quantum extremal surfaces lie deeper than ( and spacelike to ) the causal surface , and additionally act as an obstacle to causal signals .",
    "we also `` quantize '' the theorem that the apparent hroizon always lies inside the causal horizon .",
    "we comment on the implication for bulk signals coming in from the boundary .",
    "section [ barriers ] contains several theorems qualifying barriers to quantum extremal surfaces , and section [ discussion ] discusses the implications for bulk reconstruction .",
    "for any future - infinite timelike ( or null ) worldline @xmath43 ( i.e. an observer ) , we can define a future causal horizon as the boundary of the past of @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this definition is broad enough to include not only black holes , but also rindler and de sitter like horizons , to which the same laws of horizon thermodynamics also apply .",
    "the generalized second law ( gsl ) is the statement that the generalized entropy of a causal horizon is nondecreasing in time .",

    "it is also possible to extend the gsl to the case in which there is a set of future - infinite worldlines , and @xmath51 @xcite . in the context of ads / cft ,",

    "we may use @xmath23 to generalize constructs from classical general relativity to perturbative quantum gravity . recall that the classical definition of a ( marginally ) trapped surface @xmath64 is a codimension 2 spacelike surface such that the null expansion @xmath65 of future - outward - pointing geodesic congruences from @xmath64 is negative : @xmath66 , with equality for marginally trapped surfaces . recall that @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is an affine parameter along the null congruence .",

    "there are subtleties in the definition of quantum extremal surfaces that do not arise for extremal surfaces in classical geometry .",

    "readers who are not concerned with the technical discussion which follows below may wish to skip directly to the statement of theorem [ wall12thm1 ] , which is crucial to the rest of this paper .",
    "we begin by qualifying the regime of validity of the results in this paper .",
    "we work in perturbative quantum gravity via an @xmath8 _",
    "expansion_. a spacetime will be said to admit an @xmath8 expansion if its metric can be described by an expansion in finite order of @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is some length scale of the quantum fields in the theory : @xmath90 where the superscripts represent orders of @xmath8 after setting @xmath91 ( the fractional orders arise because quantized gravitons have amplitude @xmath92 ) .",
    "if we expand about some specific classical background , then the first term has no fluctuations but the others all do .",
    "the terms in this expansion must therefore be regarded as operators .",
    "( in the semiclassical approximation , one only considers expectation values of the @xmath93 term ; if one also ignores graviton fluctuations ( as done by e.g. flm @xcite ) then this is the first quantum correction to the metric , resulting in an @xmath20 contribution to the generalized entropy . )",
    "the terms in the @xmath8 expansion can be calculated by iterative quantization and backreaction of all fields , including gravitons .",
    "we may obtain an effective field theory at this level by introducing a uv cutoff at energies much smaller than the planck scale .",
    "we assume without proof that this effective field theory can be consistently defined , and that the gsl holds in it ( as stated above ) .",
    "the generalized entropy receives radiative corrections due to loop divergences .",
    "these divergences must be absorbed into counterterms , which are of subleading order in @xmath8 compared to the classical area term .",
    "@xmath94 is likewise subleading in @xmath8 since its leading order contribution is at @xmath95 .",
    "we can also include @xmath96 corrections in a similar expansion to describe a perturbatively stringy spacetime .",
    "this would produce additional subleading higher - curvature corrections to @xmath10 , which can be calculated for actions which are arbitrary functions of the riemann tensor by using the dong entropy formula @xcite .",
    "either way , the counterterms are subleading with respect to some parameter .",
    "this allows the counterterms to be consistently neglected in the results that follow . when proving inequalities in a regime with a small expansion parameter , it is sufficient to prove the result at the first order at which it is not saturated , since that dominates over all higher terms",
    ". in the context of our proofs , it can be shown @xcite that whenever the counterterms would be important , the bekenstein - hawking term is always more important , due to being lower order .",
    "the same does not necessarily hold for @xmath22 , because it is possible to find situations where an order @xmath8 correction to the area is balanced against the entanglement entropy .    in order to define the notion of a quantum extremal surface , we need to face the unpleasant fact",
    "that quantum fluctuations of a spacetime can involve superpositions of different geometries .",
    "as with any gauge theory , this leads to a drastic enhancement of the diffeomorphism group , because each term in the quantum superposition can be separately coordinatized .",
    "for example , in a quantum superposition of a black hole and a neutron star , we could define the `` r '' coordinate independently for each classical metric . even if we fix the classical background metric ( and we need not ! ) , the issue of quantum superpositions arises at the next order in @xmath8 .",
    "often this problem is dealt with by gauge fixing , but fixing the gauge introduces faddeev - popov ghosts with negative norm , which is problematic as it introduces negative contributions to the entanglement entropy , violating quantum inequalities .",
    "so it is better to define the quantum extremal surface @xmath97 in a gauge - independent ( i.e. covariant ) way .",
    "we expect that this can be done in a precise manner , but in this article our main concern is not with quantum superpositions , but rather with the effects of deforming the definition of an extremal surface by adding @xmath22 .",
    "thus we merely _ outline _ a possible approach :    it is instructive to start with the simpler case in which we extremize just the area . in this case",
    "we should promote the area from an expectation value to an operator @xmath98 .",
    "( we can likewise promote the counterterms to operators . ) the surface may then be found by demanding that the first order variation of the area vanish as an eigenvalue equation : @xmath99 where @xmath7 is a state in a joint hilbert space @xmath100 where the first factor contains the bulk field theory degrees of freedom , and the second contains the degrees of freedom for ( general linear superpositions of ) possible locations of the codimension 2 surface . since the surface is purely a theoretical construct and not an actual physical quantity , we expect that there will also be an operator @xmath101 which we can use to reduce states of @xmath102 to states of @xmath103 , the actual physical degrees of freedom .",
    "this ensures that @xmath7 corresponds to the same state of the bulk felds that we started with ( the one dual to the chosen cft state ) .    in the case of the quantum extremal surface",
    ", we can not simply promote @xmath104 to an operator , since it is not linear in the density matrix @xmath7 .",
    "fortunately , for purposes of defining the extremal surface , we are only interested in the first order variations of @xmath104 with respect to @xmath105 . by definition",
    "this first order variation is linear in the perturbations @xmath106 , so it corresponds to some linear operator , which could then be inserted into eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) .",
    "having defined the quantum extremal surface @xmath84 , we can then evaluate @xmath107 ; at this step we only need the expectation values : @xmath108 .",
    "this approach requires further investigation , but for now we choose to work under the assumption that it can be made precise in the @xmath8 expansion .",
    "hence we will assume that there always exists a gauge - frame in which @xmath84 , and any other surfaces of interest ( e.g. horizons ) , have a sharp location , and that the classical geometrical relations between such surfaces continue to hold as operator relations in the perturbative regime .",
    "we will now quote a theorem from @xcite which we will use throughout this paper to prove a number of results about quantum extremal surfaces .",
    "this theorem assumes an @xmath8 expansion ( which is needed to consistently neglect the higher - curvature counterterms , and also to justify a quantum inequality applied to @xmath22 ) :    [ wall12thm1](from @xcite ) : let @xmath109 , @xmath12 be null splitting surfaces ( i.e codimension 1 surfaces which divide spacetime into two regions @xcite and have an open exterior ) which coincide at a point @xmath110 and let @xmath25 be a spacelike slice that goes through @xmath110 . if ( 1 ) @xmath111 , and ( 2 ) @xmath109 , @xmath12 are smooth at the classical order near @xmath110 , and the spacetime is described by an @xmath8 expansion there , then there exists a way of evolving @xmath25 forward in time in a neighborhood of @xmath110 so that @xmath112 with equality only if @xmath109 and @xmath12 coincide at a neighborhood .",
    "in particular , there exists a normal vector @xmath113 to @xmath114 such that @xmath115 where @xmath49 is the null normal to @xmath109 and @xmath12 at @xmath110 .",

    "when @xmath13 has a boundary , @xmath38 is noncompact , and @xmath119 is ir divergent .",
    "this bulk ir divergence is dual to the uv divergence of @xmath37 in the boundary cft . in order to test the conjecture",

    "flm showed that the entanglement entropy of a region @xmath13 on the boundary is given by the generalized entropy of the classical extremal surface , at least at @xmath20 and for static situations .",
    "we expect that at higher orders in @xmath8 , the entanglement entropy is given by the generalized entropy of a surface whose location is sensitive to the quantum corrections to the entropy . our ideal candidate for a formula for holographic entanglement entropy in a non - classical bulk should therefore ( 1 ) be sensitive to quantum effects at any order in @xmath8 , ( 2 )",

    "a noncompact quantum extremal surface also has ir divergences , not only in the area term , but also in @xmath5 ( not to mention the counterterms ) .",
    "since the presence of ir divergences is not a new feature of quantum extremal surfaces , we will not worry about it here , but will assume that these divergences are cut off in a suitable manner .    in cases where the total state of the system is mixed , it is necessary to choose one side of @xmath97 to evaluate the entropy on : we may use either @xmath5 to calculate @xmath37 , or @xmath33 to calculate @xmath125 . in our proposal",
    "these correspond to two different bulk surfaces @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",

    "for example , in the case of an eternal black hole with an einstein - rosen bridge , even if we allow signals to be sent in from both sides , the geometry of the extremal surface lodged in its throat can not be changed by the shenker - stanford construction .",

    "this region of influence @xmath242 must be at least as large as the domain of influence @xmath145 , due to the ability to send signals into the bulk causally , but the shenker ",
    "stanford construction @xcite shows that it must be larger than that .",
    "in fact  assuming that there are no operators in @xmath40 which commute with everything else in @xmath40this region of bulk influence @xmath242 must be at least as large as @xmath240 , since one can freely act on @xmath40 with unitary operators in order to change it into anything one likes .",
    "however , @xmath242 can not extend into the complementary domain of reconstruction @xmath243 , or else unitaries in @xmath13 would be able to affect the spacelike separated region @xmath36 .    for a classical pure bulk @xmath244 , so _",
    "if _ the reconstructable region extends up to @xmath38 , then @xmath240 and @xmath243 are also complementary .",
    "that would imply that @xmath245 , so that the two concepts would be essentially the same , except that @xmath242 would also include the region timelike to @xmath38 .",
    "but it is unclear whether the needed assumptions are in fact true .",
    "these same reflections would also apply to the quantum extremal surface @xmath97 .",
    "our results provide evidence that quantum extremal surfaces @xmath97 are closely related to the regions of bulk reconstruction and influence . in section",
    "[ reach ] we used the gsl to prove that causally propagating signals can not go farther into the bulk than the closest quantum extremal surface @xmath140 . to the extent that this propagating signal is a good measure of what unitary operators can do , this suggests that the domain of influence extends no farther than the quantum extremal surface @xmath97 .",
    "another probe of the spacetime is the entanglement entropy itself , which is a good example of a nonlocal bulk observable . in section [ barriers ]",
    "we showed that in many spacetimes , there exist barrier surfaces which can not be crossed by any other quantum extremal surface @xmath246 anchored within some boundary region @xmath40 , at least when @xmath246 is continuously deformable to the region outside @xmath140 .",
    "it is therefore natural to suppose that the reconstructable region @xmath240 extends up to the outermost barrier itself .",
    "using some results from a future article @xcite , we also argued that a null surface @xmath12 shot out from a quantum extremal surface @xmath140 has the requisite properties to be a barrier to other quantum extremal surfaces .",
    "thus there are several indicators that @xmath140 forms some type of boundary surface relevant to questions of bulk reconstruction and influence from @xmath13 .",
    "we should emphasize that we have only explored these questions using a limited subset of probes , so it is possible that new regions of the bulk would be accessible to a different kind of probe .",
    "in the case where @xmath13 is taken to be the entire boundary , these results suggest that it may not be possible to reconstruct the region behind the extremal surface of the entire boundary @xmath247 from the dual cft .",
    "if that is really true , then it suggests that there might be so - called `` superselection '' information in the bulk which is not contained in the boundary cft @xcite .",
    "alternatively , there might be a firewall at @xmath247 which destroys in - falling observers and obviates the need for a region behind it @xcite .",
    "our results depend heavily on the fact that we are only interested in proving inequalities , since this allowed us to use theorem [ wall12thm1 ] to neglect higher - curvature effects in the entropy functional ( cf .",
    "section [ premises ] ) as compared to the bekenstein - hawking area term .",
    "if the higher - curvature terms were instead of the same order as the area term , many of our results would become much more difficult to prove ; perhaps even false .",
    "there is a hypothesis that in full quantum gravity , the entropy of a stationary black hole is in fact entirely due to entanglement entropy outside the horizon @xcite .",
    "that would mean that @xmath23 would be the fine - grained entropy of the exterior quantum gravity microstates .",
    "if we apply this hypothesis to quantum extremal surfaces , we would conclude that @xmath97 is really obtained by extremizing the entanglement entropy .",
    "this would _ formally _ allow the various proofs in this article to be applied using only the information - theoretical parts associated with @xmath22 . but this argument places us squarely in the non - perturbative quantum gravity regime , making usual metric concepts highly suspect .",
    "besides black hole thermodynamics , one of the few clues we have about nonperturbative quantum gravity is ads / cft .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath37 of a cft region is just as well - defined at small @xmath12 and weak coupling as at large @xmath12 and strong coupling .",
    "if ads / cft is valid in the former regime , there must be some concept in the bulk quantum gravity theory which is dual to @xmath37 .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the concept of a quantum extremal surface can be generalized to that context .",
    "perhaps progress can be made by assuming that some suitably quantum notion of holographic entanglement surfaces survives , and using that to explore the meaning of quantum geometry .",
