    "in most models of structure formation the majority of baryonic matter in the universe is contained in a uniformly - distributed intergalactic medium ( igm ) , which is predicted as a product of primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "the gunn - peterson constraint on the component of this igm ( gunn & peterson 1965 ; scheuer 1965 ) implies that the gas must have been highly ionized by @xmath14  5 , because the flux decrement observed on the blue side of the ly@xmath1 emission lines in the spectra of high - redshift quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) appears to be entirely consistent with absorption by discrete clouds along the line of sight ( steidel & sargent 1987 ; giallongo  1994 ) .    the meta - galactic ultraviolet ( uv ) background , which is widely believed to be primarily the integrated light of qsos , is thought to be responsible for maintaining the diffuse igm and the ly@xmath1 forest clouds in a highly - ionized state .",
    "this uv background may also be responsible for the ionization of metal - rich qso absorption systems ( steidel 1990 ) , the ionization of clouds in the galactic halo ( ferrara & field 1994 ) , as well as for producing the sharp edges of disks in nearby spirals ( dove & shull 1994 ; maloney 1993 ; bland - hawthorn , freeman & quinn 1997 ) .    from the evolution of the qso luminosity function ,",
    "recent theoretical calculations for @xmath15  2.53 indicate that the contribution of observed qsos alone to the mean intensity of the uv background is @xmath16  0.6 at the lyman limit , i.e. , at a frequency @xmath17    ( haardt & madau 1996 , hereafter hm96 ) . throughout",
    "we adopt the notation @xmath18  erg  s@xmath7  @xmath8  hz@xmath7  sr@xmath7 and we assume a cosmology of @xmath19  0.5 , @xmath20  0 and @xmath21  /  50  km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "indirect estimates of @xmath13 are uncertain ( see  [ sec : discuss ] ) and , given its importance , strenuous efforts have been made to directly measure the meta - galactic uv background .",
    "hogan & weymann ( 1987 ) proposed that long - slit spectroscopy of `` blank sky '' should reveal patches of fluorescent ly@xmath1 emission from ly@xmath1 forest clouds excited by the meta - galactic background .",
    "a detailed radiative - transfer treatment of ly@xmath1 emission from thick clouds ( @xmath22  @xmath8 ) photo - ionized by the meta - galactic radiation is given by binette  ( 1993 ) .    in a more recent paper , gould & weinberg ( 1996 ) show that for clouds with column density @xmath23  @xmath8 ( optically thick to lyman continuum photons ) , @xmath24  50% of the incident energy of the ionizing background emerges in the form of ly@xmath1 photons , including those resulting from collisional excitation .",
    "this fraction is robust and independent of cloud geometry , implying uniform surface brightness .",
    "a ly@xmath1 photon is absorbed and re - emitted within the cloud until it is doppler shifted by an atom with a velocity @xmath25  4  @xmath26 , at which point it can escape . a cloud with a typical one - dimensional ( 1d ) velocity dispersion of @xmath27",
    "30  km  s@xmath7 would have a double - peaked ly@xmath1 line with a separation of 8  @xmath28  240  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "hence , moderate - resolution spectroscopy ( @xmath29  1500 ) of an optically - thick cloud , along with adequate integration time , will yield a direct measurement of the intensity of the ionizing background .",
    "lowenthal  ( 1990 ) have observed the lyman limit system ( lls ) towards q0731@xmath30653 , and on the basis of a two hour exposure spectrogram with the multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) , place a 2  @xmath4 upper limit of @xmath31  200 at @xmath32  2.91 , on the assumption that the clouds are only 1  in extent .",
    "comparable sensitivity is obtained by martnez - gonzlez  ( 1995 ) through narrow - band imaging on the isaac newton telescope ( int ) .",
    "assuming larger clouds ( @xmath33  10 ) , their 3  @xmath4 upper - limit is equivalent to @xmath31  80 at z  =  3.4 ( see figure  [ fig : jnulimits ] and equation  [ eqn : jnu0eta ] ) .",
    "moderate - dispersion long - slit spectroscopy appears the most promising technique with which to detect ly@xmath1 fluorescence . from typical quasar lines - of - sight ,",
    "there are on average one or more optically - thick lls per unit redshift interval at @xmath34  2 ( stengler - larrea 1995 ) .",
    "hence , a single spectrogram with a slit a few arcmin in length will intercept several such high - column - density clouds ( see  [ subsec : results ] ) . imaging with narrow - band interference filters ( typically @xmath35  100 ) , although covering a larger solid angle over a smaller redshift interval , provides less contrast against the sky for line emission than does spectroscopy . therefore , narrow - band imaging can not achieve the required sensitivity without prohibitively long integrations .",
    "similarly , the expected surface brightness of ly@xmath1 is at least an order of magnitude too faint to be detected in the deepest broad - band optical imaging , i.e. , the hubble deep field ( williams  1996 ) .",
    "even if sufficient depth could be attained , since the broad - band covers a large slice of redshift space the measurement would be confusion limited , as the lls clouds ( expected to be @xmath33  10  in extent ,  [ subsec : results ] ) would overlap .    in this paper , we present the results of deep keck  ii long - slit spectroscopy with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris , oke  1995 ) at moderately - high dispersion in the blue , 150  km  s@xmath7 full width half maximum ( fwhm ) . in ",

    "as part of another program , we have been undertaking deep long - slit spectroscopy on the fields of qsos whose spectra show damped ly@xmath1 absorption systems .",
    "one field involved a set - up in the blue with a high - dispersion grating , and we are able to use the `` blank sky '' in the long - slit spectrogram for this investigation . the primary targets in these data are two actively star - forming galaxies at @xmath36  2.81 ( s2 & s3 in warren & mller 1996 ) with angular separations of 12  & 21  from the @xmath37 qso / damped system pks0528@xmath38250 , which lies at the same redshift .",
    "the coordinates of the slit center were @xmath39  05@xmath4030@xmath410935 , @xmath42  @xmath382503282 , and the position angle was set to 952 east of north so as to intercept both galaxies .",
    "the spectra of the target objects are to be presented in a forthcoming paper ( bunker  1998 ) .",
    "we obtained the long - slit spectroscopy on the night of 1998 january 20 u.t .  using lris at the f/15 cassegrain focus of the 10-m keck  ii telescope .",
    "the lris detector is a tek 2048@xmath43 ccd with 24  pixels and an angular scale of 0212 per pixel .",
    "we read out the ccd in two - amplifier mode .",
    "the observations were obtained using the 900  line  mm@xmath7 grating in first order blazed at 5500   , producing a dispersion of 0.839    per pixel .",
    "the reference arc lamps and sky - lines have fwhm  @xmath44  33.5  pixels , so for objects that fill the slit , the velocity width of a spectrally unresolved line is fwhm  @xmath44  150175  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "the grating was tilted to sample the wavelength range 45006200   , corresponding to ly@xmath1 in the redshift range 2.7  @xmath0  4.1 .",
    "the observations used the 1  by 3  long - slit .",
    "a total of 5400 s of on - source integration was obtained , and this was broken into three individual exposures of duration 1800 s that spanned an airmass range of 1.411.53 .",
    "the telescope was dithered by 75 along the slit between each integration to enable more effective cosmic ray rejection and the elimination of bad pixels . in the @xmath45-band",
    "the seeing had a fwhm  =  0811 , and the sky background ( no moon ) was 22.3  mag  arcsec@xmath9 .",
    "spectrophotometric standard stars g191b2b & hz44 ( massey  1988 ; massey & gronwall 1990 ) were observed at similar airmass to determine the spectral shape of the sensitivity function , but our observations were rendered non - photometric by intermittent thin cirrus .",
    "however , we were able to boot - strap our spectrophotometry to the narrow - band ly@xmath1 line fluxes from mller & warren ( 1993 ) of the two @xmath36  2.81 star - forming galaxies on the long slit .",
    "as we expect the ly@xmath1 emitting patches to have dimensions much greater than our slit width and to have approximately uniform surface brightness , the photometric zero - points were corrected for slit losses using standard star observations with two different slit widths .",
    "the initial stages of the data reduction followed standard procedures and were accomplished using iraf .",
    "all the calibration and data frames were bias subtracted by fitting a low - order function to the appropriate over - scan region . each half of the ccd",
    "was then converted to photo - electrons by correcting for the gain of the corresponding read - out amplifier .",
    "a high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) dark frame was then subtracted .",
    "the next step consisted of calibrating the pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations of the ccd .",
    "contemporaneous flat fields were obtained with a halogen lamp immediately after the science exposures , and these internal flats were normalized through division by the extracted lamp spectrum .",
    "the snr for these flat fields was 100300 per pixel . in order to remove the residual lower spatial frequency variations in the flat field due to non - uniform illumination of the slit",
    ", we also obtained spectral dome and twilight - sky flats .",
    "cosmic rays were identified in the flat fielded spectra by iteratively calculating the noise in each column perpendicular to the dispersion axis and identifying discrepant pixels ; those pixels associated with structure sharper than the point - spread function ( psf ) were flagged as cosmic rays .",
    "wavelength calibration was obtained from arc lamp spectra also taken immediately after the data frames . to quantify the distortions across the ccd , we traced the centroid of each arc - line ( and the sky - lines in the data frames ) at 10 pixel intervals over the length of the slit ( 800 pixels ) .",
    "it was found that the centroids of the lines shifted by up to 3 pixels , comparable to the instrumental resolution .",
    "this distortion was well fit by a quadratic along the columns ( the spatial axis ) and a cubic along the rows ( the dispersion direction ) .",
    "hence we were able to form a distortion matrix to map from a pixel space to a wavelength solution , leaving rms residuals to the fit of 0.1 pixels ( 0.08   ) .    rather than doing the sky - subtraction in the usual manner by fitting a polynomial to each column ( which might subtract the extended emission we are looking for ) , we first rectified the sky lines using the distortion matrix .",
    "we then created a high snr 1d sky spectrum by averaging the rectified rows .",
    "the slit illumination function was determined by collapsing the two - dimensional ( 2d ) blank sky spectrum dispersion axis , and this function was used to scale the 1d sky spectrum for row - by - row sky subtraction .",
    "the individual sky - subtracted , rectified 2d spectra taken at different dither positions along the slit were then registered and averaged , with a percentile clipping algorithm used to reject cosmic rays that had escaped previous cuts .",
    "a mask was used to flag the known bad pixels , which were excluded from the averaging .",
    "the individual 1800  s integrations were sufficiently long for our data to be background ( rather than read - out noise ) limited at all wavelengths .",
    "the measured noise agreed well with the poissonian statistics of the sky background , demonstrating that any additional noise introduced by our data reduction techniques was insignificant .",
    "after rectification and sky - subtraction , we searched for extended ly@xmath1 line emission by applying various filters along the spatial axis of the combined 2d spectrum .",
    "we convolved the 2d spectrum with a highly - elliptical 2d gaussian oriented parallel to the slit . for the minor axis ( along the dispersion direction ) , the width of the kernel was set to be comparable to the spectral resolution .",
    "we varied the length of the major axis to search for signal on any characteristic scale length between 1  ( our seeing disk ) and 180  ( the length of the slit ) .",
    "for the anticipated range in @xmath13 , the signal per resolution element is not large , so this smoothing is essential .",
    "we repeated the smoothing with simple boxcar filtering of various lengths along the slit axis , followed by convolution with a gaussian of comparable extent to the seeing disk .",
    "this second approach is optimal if the ly@xmath1 clouds do indeed have uniform surface brightness ( gould & weinberg 1996 ) . for both techniques",
    ", visual inspection revealed no significant extended single - line emission .",
    "the only ly@xmath1 line - emission sources detected were the target galaxies , pks0528@xmath38250 s1 & s2 .",
    "these have also been observed in continuum imaging ( mller & warren 1998 ) , with rest - frame equivalent widths of @xmath46  88    & 46    respectively .",
    "this implies that ly@xmath1 arises from an internal uv source ( star formation or agn activity ) .",
    "charlot & fall ( 1993 ) calculate @xmath46  80200    for a star forming galaxy , depending on the initial mass function ( imf ) . however , selective extinction of this line through resonant scattering and suppression by dust can greatly reduce the equivalent width of ly@xmath1 in star forming galaxies ( e.g. , steidel  1996 ) . in stark contrast , ly@xmath1 produced by external photo - ionization should have a much larger equivalent width , as the continuum arises mainly from two - photon decays .",
    "hence , the rest - uv continuum around ly@xmath1 provides excellent discrimination between local ob stars and the diffuse meta - galactic background as the source of the lyman continuum photons .",
    "any source with a detectable continuum can only yield an upper - limit on @xmath13 , as it will likely be dominated by local effects .",
    "our long slit also intercepted a [ ]  @xmath47  3727  emission line at @xmath36  0.424 , 615 east of s3 , associated with a @xmath48  22.8  mag galaxy .",
    "we detect modest continuum ( w@xmath49[]=  100    @xmath25  10   ) , and the redshift is confirmed with [ ]  3869   .",
    "the [ ] doublet is well resolved , so our resolution is better than 221  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "our search techniques failed to reveal the signature of ly@xmath1 fluorescence from optically - thick clouds .",
    "a lack of ly@xmath1 emission constrains the incident uv flux . in order to test the validity of our search methods and to place meaningful upper limits on @xmath50",
    ", we examined the recoverability of artificial emission lines added to our data frames .",
    "these synthetic lines simulated clouds of various sizes , and were convolved with the seeing disk and the instrumental spectral resolution . for those with shorter spatial extent , less than 5 , we were able to recover 90% of the simulated",
    "spectrally unresolved lines with total",
    "snr  =  3 . however ,",
    "for larger artificial clouds , the recoverability was slightly worse for the same integrated snr ( but lower surface brightness ) .",
    "this is because slit illumination effects become more dominant on these larger scale lengths , and the spectra of the target objects introduce confusion . for snr  =  3",
    ", the recoverability falls below 60% on scales exceeding 1 .",
    "our typical noise in a 1  @xmath51 aperture corresponds to a ly@xmath1 surface brightness of @xmath52  0.40.6 ( 1  @xmath4 ) .",
    "we adopt the convention @xmath53  erg  s@xmath7  @xmath8  arcsec@xmath9 .",
    "the quoted noise is for ` clean ' regions of the night sky , devoid of strong lines , and the sensitivity declines slightly at the shorter wavelengths of our spectral range ( 4500    @xmath54  6200   ) .",
    "these limits are for a spectral extraction width of 4  pixels ( 220  km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "this is optimal for a 1d velocity dispersion of @xmath26  =  30  km  s@xmath7 , comparable to that measured for ly@xmath1 forest clouds at @xmath55 ( kim  1997 ) .",
    "the line widths may in fact be greater due to coherent velocity structure ( shears and bulk flows ) .",
    "for @xmath56  20  km  s@xmath7 , the twin peaks of the doppler - broadened resonant profile become resolved , and the snr falls proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "we have corrected our limits for @xmath58  0.05  mag of foreground galactic extinction ( burstein & heiles 1984 ) .",
    "the recent cobe / iras dust maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) indicate a greater extinction ( @xmath58  0.2  mag ) .",
    "our 3  @xmath4 upper limits on the ly@xmath1 surface brightness as a function of 1d velocity dispersion and angular cloud size , @xmath59 , projected along our 1-wide slit are : @xmath60 for 1  @xmath61  60 , 2.7  @xmath0  4.1 and @xmath62  30  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "we use our results to place an upper limit on @xmath50 as a function of redshift and the size and velocity dispersion of the clouds .",
    "as this is derived from the limiting surface brightness attained , the constraint on the meta - galactic lyman continuum flux is independent of @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and is only subject to the @xmath66 cosmological surface brightness dimming .",
    "the measurement of @xmath67 from ly@xmath1 fluorescence is immune to the effects of _ in situ _ dust ; the extra - galactic lyman continuum photons only penetrate clouds to a depth of @xmath68  @xmath8 corresponding to @xmath69  mag for a galactic gas - to - dust ratio .",

    "therefore , the contribution of star - forming galaxies to @xmath13 is given by : @xmath122for an ionizing spectrum of the form @xmath123 , which can be expressed as : @xmath124 therefore , the dust - corrected sfr per unit co - moving volume at @xmath104 is equivalent to @xmath125 , if the rest - uv is extinguished by factors of 63 .",
    "hence , our 3  @xmath4 limit of @xmath126  2.0 constrains @xmath127  25%50% , assuming qsos contribute @xmath128  0.6 ( hm96 ) .",
    "however , meurer  ( 1997 ) argue that _ in situ _ dust obscuration leads to a much greater underestimate of the integrated star formation rate , and that the rest - uv extinction correction should be a factor of @xmath44  15 rather than 36 . if this is so , our constraint is significantly tighter ( @xmath127  10% at @xmath3  3 ) , comparable to but still somewhat above the best limits on the lyman continuum escape fraction from galaxies today ( @xmath127  1% , deharveng  1997 ) .",
    "the absence of an absorption trough on the blue side of the ly@xmath1 emission line in the spectra of high - redshift qsos represents the best limit on the density of a neutral , smoothly - distributed igm ( gunn & peterson 1965 ; scheuer 1965 ) .",
    "a measurement of the ionizing meta - galactic flux , when combined with limits on the baryon density from primordial nucleosynthesis and the gunn - peterson optical depth ( jenkins & ostriker 1991 ; giallongo , cristiani & trevese 1992 ) measures what fraction of gas has collapsed into galaxies and discrete clouds .",
    "our upper limit on @xmath13 requires that baryonic matter in the diffuse igm comprises @xmath129 of the closure density at @xmath104 ( from equation  2 of songaila , cowie & lilly 1990 ) .",
    "we assume the mean optical depth of the igm is @xmath130 ( steidel & sargent 1987 ) . from standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( walker  1991 ) ,",
    "our results imply that the fraction of baryons residing in the diffuse igm at @xmath104 is at most @xmath131 ( where @xmath132/100  km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 ) , i.e. , no constraint for low values of h@xmath49 .",
    "we are undertaking deeper integrations which should improve this upper limit by a factor of three .",
    "the recent super - kamiokande detection of neutrino oscillation ( fukuda  1998 ) , although providing only a mass difference between neutrino flavors rather than an absolute measurement of mass , has rekindled interest in hot dark matter ( hdm ) .",
    "we can use our upper limits on @xmath50 to constrain any relic decaying neutrino flux ( e.g. , sciama 1990 ) . according to this theory ,",
    "relativistic neutrinos make up the bulk of the critical matter density ( @xmath133 ) , and their decay photons can ionize hydrogen ( i.e. , @xmath134  13.6  ev ) but not helium . adopting the values from sciama ( 1995 , 1998 ) for the decay photon energy ( @xmath135  13.8  ev ) , the neutrino lifetime ( @xmath136s ) and number density at the current epoch ( @xmath137 ) would result in a uv flux at @xmath104 equivalent to @xmath138 ( figure  [ fig : jnulimits ] ) .",
    "this would correspond to a 6  @xmath4 signal in our spectrum over @xmath139 .",
    "our failure to detect such ly@xmath1 emission rules out with high confidence a @xmath140 cosmology in which the relativistic decaying neutrinos of sciama ( 1998 ) form the bulk of dark matter .",
    "furthermore , in a mixed dark matter ( mdm ) scenario , an hdm component in the form of @xmath141  13.8  ev sciama neutrinos can comprise at most @xmath142 .",
    "our observations constrain the combination of parameters @xmath143 , the excess photon energy above the lyman limit available for photo - ionization .",
    "if the neutrinos do account for most of the critical matter density in a flat universe ( i.e. , @xmath144 , @xmath145 ) , then @xmath146 therefore , the energy of the decay photons can be at most only 0.6  per  cent above the ionization potential of , which would require much fine - tuning .",
    "our moderate - dispersion long - slit spectroscopy with lris / keck has placed a 3  @xmath4 upper limit on the ambient uv background at @xmath3  3 equivalent to a flux at the lyman limit of @xmath92  2.0 , assuming optically - thick clouds with dimensions @xmath44  10 .",
    "we anticipate even greater sensitivity in the blue for observations at lower air mass and unaffected by cirrus .",
    "although this direct limit is almost two orders of magnitude lower than any previously published , it is still a factor of three above the expected contribution of known qsos at these epochs .",
    "however , it does enable us to say that the completeness of optical qso catalogs is better than 30% , and that the contribution to @xmath13(@xmath3  3 ) from star - forming galaxies can not exceed twice that from known quasars .",
    "we constrain the escape fraction of lyman continuum photons from star - forming galaxies at these redshifts to be @xmath127  10%50% ( assuming extinction corrections of 153 at @xmath147  1500   ) .",
    "although our relatively short ( 5400  s ) integration in this pilot study is insufficient to reach the lower limit on the quasar contribution to @xmath50 , we are able to exclude the possibility that relic neutrinos comprise the bulk of dark matter , as we would detect ly@xmath1 fluorescence from the flux of ionizing decay photons .",
    "the size of optically - thick qso absorption systems is largely unconstrained (  [ subsec : results ] ) , and their morphology is entirely unknown because quasar sight - lines yield only one - dimensional information .",
    "some work has been done using two lines - of - sight provided , for example , by a pair of lensed quasar images ( e.g. , dinshaw 1994 ) .",
    "the single example of multiple sight - lines to a damped system indicates a size greater than @xmath148kpc ( briggs 1989 ) . without strong constraints on the sizes of the high - column - density systems ,",
    "it is impossible to differentiate between the scenario where outer galactic halos are directly responsible for the absorption or whether the culprit is more extended diffuse gas .",
    "this may be associated with a cluster , possibly with a fragmented , filamentary topology ( as suggested by recent sph simulations , e.g. , katz 1996 ) .",
    "a detection of fluorescent ly@xmath1 would reveal the size and morphology of the optically - thick clouds , which is a primary clue to understanding their origin and relation to the galaxies which are forming at these epochs .    the phenomenal light - grasp of keck plus the new insights afforded by gould & weinberg ( 1996 ) make it possible to design an experiment with an extremely high likelihood of detecting fluorescent ly@xmath1 emission from high - column lyman limit absorbers .",
    "this will enable the first direct measurement of the size of these high - redshift clouds , and the determination of @xmath13 at @xmath3  2.53 .",
    "this initial study has shown that , for a dark - time integration of @xmath33  20  hours in good conditions , the sensitivity of lris / keck should be sufficient to detect the lyman continuum background at @xmath97  5  @xmath4 , even if the meta - galactic flux has no major contribution other than the known high - redshift quasars .",
    "we are embarking on an extensive program of lris / keck observations to obtain long - slit spectra of several hours . by using a filter of width @xmath149  10%",
    ", we can obtain several parallel long - slits on the same spectrogram , thereby covering a large solid angle while concentrating on those redshifts ( @xmath150  2.5 ) where our sensitivity to @xmath67 is greatest ( figure  [ fig : probz ] ) .",
    "for the first time we will set strict quantitative limits on the inventory of sources of uv radiation at high redshift .",
