    "string theory  @xcite provides a consistent framework for the unification of gravity with the standard model ( sm ) gauge interactions .",
    "the string scale @xmath4 is naturally close to the quantum gravity scale @xmath5 gev .",
    "however , arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali  @xcite have proposed an alternative to this scenario .",
    "they assumed the space - time is more than 4 dimensions with the sm particles living on a d3-brane .",
    "while the electromagnetic , strong , and weak forces are confined to this brane , gravity can propagate in the extra dimensions .",
    "the effective fundamental planck scale is of the order of tev with large extra dimensions as large as @xmath6 .",
    "tev scale string theories are also possible with advance of d - branes  @xcite .",
    "thus , make it possible for experiments to test and probe the theory at high energy colliders  @xcite .",
    "in the simplest open - string model  @xcite , it is assumed that all sm particles are identified as open strings confined to a d3-brane universe while a graviton is a closed string propagating freely in the bulk .",
    "one novel feature of the open - string model is the appearance of string resonances in the scattering of particles .",
    "earlier works on phenomenological studies  @xcite based on open - string amplitudes have been performed , which reduce to sm tree - level amplitudes at low energies . when @xmath7 , clear resonances can be observed in experiments , in particular the mass spectrum of the resonances is given by @xmath8 , which is very different from the kaluza - klein states in the add @xcite or randall - sundrum  @xcite model .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath9 there would not appear resonances but may experience virtual interference effects from the string resonances . effectively , the virtual effect is similarly to a contact interaction scaling as @xmath10 .",
    "note that the usual 4-fermion contact interaction due to exchange of new gauge bosons or leptoquarks has the leading effect of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the scale of new physics  @xcite .",
    "bounds on four - fermion contact interactions induced by string resonances have been estimated based on the analysis on @xmath11 contact interaction  @xcite .",
    "although the approximation is valid , we shall show in this work that the effect is more complicated than just the simple substitution @xmath13 .",
    "the major improvement from previous work is as follows .",
    "we start directly from open - string amplitudes and perform a global analysis instead of using the result of an analysis on contact interaction @xcite .",
    "the global data include drell - yan production at the tevatron , hera charged and neutral current deep - inelastic scattering , total hadronic , and leptonic @xmath14 cross section at lep  2 . some of the data ( cdf , hera , and lep  2 ) have been updated since the summer of 2004 .",
    "we shall see that drell - yan production , due to large invariant mass data , provides the strongest constraint among the global data . by combining all data",
    ", the string scale @xmath4 must be larger than @xmath15 tev for @xmath2 at 95% confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the tree - level open - string amplitudes and its low energy approximation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] we describe the high energy data sets that we used in this analysis . in sec .",

    "we summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "our construction of tree - level open - string amplitudes follows the same approach as that outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite . they assumed that the tree - level open - string amplitudes represent the scattering of massless sm particles as the zeroth string modes .",
    "the sm is embedded in a type iib string theory whose 10-dimensional space has six dimensions compactified on a torus with a common period @xmath16 .",
    "there are @xmath17 coincident d3-brane , on which open strings may end , that lie in the 4 extended dimensions .",
    "this approach assures the correct low energy phenomenology as given by the sm , yet captures one of the essential features of string theory , namely the string resonances .",
    "the 4-point tree - level open - string amplitude is given as a sum of ordered amplitudes multiplied by group theory chan - paton factors and can be expressed generically as  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 are kinematic parts of the amplitude .",
    "the mandelstam variables are denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 are the chan - paton factors  @xcite that involve traces over the group representation matrices @xmath23 .",
    "for example , @xmath24 typically , with normalization @xmath25 the chan - paton factors are in the range of @xmath26 to 4 .",
    "since a complete string model construction for the electroweak interaction of the sm is unavailable , chan - paton factors are taken as free parameters in our calculation .",
    "@xmath27 is essentially the veneziano amplitude  @xcite @xmath28 where the regge slope @xmath29 , and @xmath30 as either @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "we start with drell - yan production of a pair of leptons . in the massless limit of the fermions we label their chirality @xmath33 .",
    "the tree - level open - string amplitude is @xmath34\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding standard model amplitude is @xmath35 where @xmath36 here @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the electric charge of the fermion @xmath40 in units of proton charge , and the @xmath41 coupling @xmath42 . identifying the string coupling with the gauge coupling @xmath43 and matching the chan - paton factor @xmath44 as @xmath45 one can demand the string amplitude expression in eq.([str ] ) to reproduce the standard model amplitude in the low - energy limit .",
    "since the string amplitude describes massless particle scattering , the masses of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 gauge bosons are introduced by hand .",
    "so eq . ( [ str ] ) becomes @xmath48 the amplitude for @xmath49 process is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ strlow ] ) by changing @xmath50 to @xmath51 . as for the @xmath52 and @xmath53 processes , we use the corresponding @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , and interchange @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ strlow ] ) .    the factor @xmath57 in the veneziano amplitude @xmath27 develops poles at @xmath58 , implying resonance states with masses @xmath59 .",

    "before describing the data sets used in our analysis , let us first specify certain important aspects of the analysis technique . since the next - to - leading order calculations do not exist for the new interaction , we use leading order ( lo ) calculations for contributions from both the sm and the new interactions , for consistency .",
    "however , in many cases , e.g. in the analysis of precision electroweak parameters , it is important to use the best available calculations of their sm values , as in many cases data is sensitive to the next - to - leading and sometimes even to higher - order corrections . therefore , we normalize our leading order calculations to either the best calculations available , or to the low-@xmath64 region of the data set , where the contribution from the string resonances is expected to be vanishing .",
    "this is equivalent to introducing a @xmath64-dependent @xmath65-factor and using the same @xmath65-factor for both the sm contribution and the effects of string resonances .",
    "the details of this procedure for each data set are given in the corresponding section . wherever parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) are needed",
    ", we use the cteq5l ( leading order fit ) set @xcite .",
    "the reason to use the lo pdf set is that lo pdfs are extracted using lo cross section calculations , thus making them consistent with our approach .",

    "the sensitivity reach is as high as 19 tev for @xmath3 .",
    "note that the sensitivity obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is somewhat lower than the sensitivity obtained in this paper , because their analysis is based on the search for a single resonance state while ours is based on the deviation in the whole invariant mass spectrum .",
    "therefore , statistically we can obtain a higher sensitivity .",
    "the ultimate consequence of a low string scale is the testable string scattering amplitudes at hadron collider .",
    "the scattering of particles shows the stringy nature .",
    "the most obvious sign is the presence of string resonances .",
