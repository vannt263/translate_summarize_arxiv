    "low dimensional bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in highly asymmetric traps have recently been achieved , which opens new possibilities in the investigation of clouds of bosonic and fermionic gases @xcite .",
    "low - dimensional bosonic systems have many remarkable properties which distinguish them from 3d systems .",
    "one of them is the growth of the interaction when the density is decreased . as a result",
    "the system enters into the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) regime .",
    "the properties of the bose gas then coincide with the gas of free fermions .",
    "this follows from the exact solution to the problem of hard - core bosons with repulsive interaction obtained by lieb and liniger @xcite .",
    "the opposite regime with weak interaction ( high density case ) is the mean field ( mf ) regime @xcite .",
    "the tg and mf regimes can be characterized by the parameter @xmath0 which is equal to the ratio of the interaction energy and the kinetic energy of the ground state of gas , i.e. @xmath1 . here @xmath2 is the atomic mass , @xmath3 is the one - dimensional coupling constant , and @xmath4 is the @xmath5 density .",
    "the case @xmath6 corresponds to high densities , when the description by the mean field theory is valid .",
    "the case @xmath7 corresponds to the strong repulsive interaction - the tonks - girardeau regime .",
    "the modern experiments with bose gas in highly elongated traps now are in the region @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "one of the important phenomena for the experiments is the collective oscillations of the bose gas in the different regimes .",
    "it is particularly interesting to investigate the dynamics of breathing and dipole modes for mf and tg regimes , as well as the crossover between them .",
    "the theoretical predictions for the frequencies in harmonic longitudinal traps @xmath9 are obtained in refs .",
    "it is shown that the frequency of oscillations in the mean field regime is @xmath10 , while it is @xmath11 in the tg regime .",
    "the last value coincides with the one observed for the thermal gas . for the 3d cigar",
    "the frequency is @xmath12 .",
    "these investigations involve the combination of the exact solution by lieb and liniger , the local density approximation , the hydrodynamic equations , and the extended nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "note that information for oscillations in the high - dimensional regimes can be found in the review @xcite . in this work",
    "we shall study resonances in the oscillations of 1d bose gas in both regimes .",
    "the periodic and random modulations of the trap potential and the atomic scattering length are subject to our analysis .",
    "the mf regime is described by the 1d gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation with two - body interaction @xmath13 this equation is derived from the 3d gp equation in a strongly anisotropic external potential .",
    "the dynamics in the radial direction is then averaged out @xcite and the longitudinal profile of the wave function satisfies eq .",
    "( [ mf ] ) .",
    "the wave function is normalized so that the number of atoms in the bec is @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the longitudinal trapping potential , which is assumed in this work to be harmonic @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath17 describes the variation in time of the trap .",
    "the effective nonlinear coupling constant is @xmath3 . in the case of a harmonic transverse trap potential @xmath18 , eq .",
    "( [ mf ] ) is valid under the assumption @xmath19 and we have @xmath20 .",
    "the function @xmath21 describes the variation in time of the effective nonlinearity .",
    "a first method to vary the effective nonlinearity is to modulate in time the transverse trap width or equivalently the transverse frequency @xmath22 .",
    "the modulations of the transverse frequency impose variations of the bec density in the @xmath23-plane , which in turn involve variations of the nonlinear interaction @xcite .",
    "nonlinear resonances in 2d bec for such modulations have been studied in @xcite .",
    "a second method to vary the effective nonlinearity is to modulate the atomic scattering length by the so - called feshbach resonance technique @xcite .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that variation of the s - wave scattering length , including a possibility to change its sign , can be achieved by using the feshbach resonance @xmath24\\ ] ] @xmath25 is the value of the scattering length far from resonance , @xmath26 is the time - dependent external magnetic field , @xmath27 is the width of the resonance , and @xmath28 is the resonant value of the magnetic field .",
    "feshbach resonances have been observed in @xmath29na at @xmath30 and @xmath31 g @xcite , in @xmath32li at @xmath33 g @xcite , and in @xmath34rb at @xmath35 g with @xmath36 g @xcite . in the case of resonance dynamics where @xmath25 is slowly varying and keeps a constant sign atom losses",
    ". however atom losses may be important when crossing the resonance @xcite .",
    "this is the case of the @xmath29na condensate where it is necessary to cross the feshbach resonance to change the sign of the atomic scattering length .",
    "the approach developed in this paper should then be modified to take into account this phenomenon .",
    "if we are not close to the resonance , losses are small and in a first approximation they can be taken into account by a time - varying number of atoms in the effective variational equation for the width .",
    "this should lead to damped secondary oscillations with a time scale larger than the oscillations time .",
    "however atoms losses can be minimized down to a negligible level by certain experimental control that have been implemented in particular in the @xmath34rb case @xcite . furthermore in ref .  @xcite it is demonstrated in the case of @xmath32li that a change of the sign of the scattering length can be obtained without crossing the resonance by the so - called coupled channel method .",
    "our study of the nonlinear management is triggered by these experimental achievements .    according to kolomeisky _",
    "_ @xcite the tg regime is described by the nonlinear schrdinger equation with quintic nonlinearity and trap potential @xmath37 it is known that this model does not capture every aspect of the dynamics of an atomic gas in the tg regime , in particular it overestimates the coherence in interference patterns at small number of particles @xcite .",
    "however eq .  ( [ eq:2 ] ) has been shown to reproduce the collective spectrum of a gas in the tg regime within a local density approximation @xcite .",

    "we apply a variational approach using the gaussian ansatz @xmath45 note that the equation for the gas center of mass is decoupled from the equations for oscillations so we did not take it into consideration . the ansatz yields a closed - form evolution equation for the width @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 . in the repulsive case @xmath50 and in absence of modulations",

    "in this section we address the role of a time - varying nonlinearity and assume that the trap is stationary @xmath101 .",
    "we shall mainly focus our attention to the periodic management @xmath102 , but we shall also consider random fluctuations of the effective nonlinearity in the 1d gp equation .",
    "we shall first address the case where the oscillation frequency of the nonlinear management is much higher than the trapping frequency , i.e. @xmath103 .",
    "we must also assume @xmath104 to prevent from exciting the transverse modes .",
    "in such a case the influence of the nonlinear management is negligible unless the nonlinear management amplitude is large .",
    "the problem of nonlinearity management for bec , the so - called feshbach resonance ( fr ) management , has already been considered for 1d bec in refs .",
    "@xcite and for 2d bec in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors were the first ones to propose a technique of fr management , based on a time - periodic change of the magnitude and sign of the scattering length by a resonantly tuned ac magnetic field .",
    "the fr management resembles the so - called dispersion - management ( dm ) technique in fiber optics , which is based on a periodic concatenation of fibers with opposite signs of the group - velocity dispersion .",

    "the analysis shows that in the mean field regime the resonances are _ nonlinear _ and bistability exists in the vicinity of a critical frequency which is significantly above the eigenfrequency of the bec .",
