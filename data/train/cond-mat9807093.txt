    "spin - peierls systems have been the subject of a renewed interest because of the discovery of several inorganic quasi - one dimensional ( q1d ) spin - peierls compounds .",
    "a very well studied example is cugeo@xmath0 .",
    "this q1d compound made of weakly coupled cuo@xmath1 chains has a spin - peierls transition at @xmath2 @xcite , as revealed by diffraction measurements , showing a dimerization below @xmath3 , and by susceptibility data , which indicate the opening of a spin gap at @xmath3 .",
    "cugeo@xmath0 can be doped in a controlled fashion , giving the unique opportunity to study the role of impurities in a spin - peierls system .",
    "doping is done in two different ways .",
    "one possibility is to directly affect the spin degrees of freedom within each cuo@xmath1 chain by substituting some of the cu atoms ( whose spin is @xmath4 ) with magnetic ( ni @xcite , which has @xmath5 , or co @xcite , @xmath6 ) or non - magnetic ( zn @xcite , mg @xcite ) impurities .",
    "another way is by substituting ge with si @xcite , which is expected to modify the strength of the exchange couplings among the magnetic ions .",
    "for all these compounds , even a small amount of doping strongly enhances the magnetic fluctuations , leading in most cases to a lower temperature nel phase coexisting with the peierls s distorted phase .",
    "for instance , in 0.3% si - doped compounds , free spins are released which contribute with a curie - like behavior below @xmath7 ( which is slightly reduced with respect to the undoped sample ) , and finally get frozen below the nel temperature @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the same behavior has been reported in a @xmath9 zn - doped compound , where magnetization measurements can be interpreted as if approximately one spin-1/2 per zn atom is released @xcite . in all cases but co - doped samples",
    "@xcite , the low doping @xmath10 phase diagram seems to have universal features @xcite : @xmath3 decreases almost linearly with @xmath11 , while no critical concentration for the appearance of the nel phase has till now been revealed down to the lowest accessible impurity concentrations ( e.g. 0.12% zn for which @xmath12 @xcite ) .    at larger doping ,",
    "the situation is still not fully established .",
    "however , most of the data indicate that over some critical @xmath13 , the spin - peierls long - range order disappears , although short - range correlations seem to persist . for mg - doped samples",
    ", it is claimed that at @xmath14 a first order phase transition takes place which is signaled by a jump of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "manabe _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have reported an antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering with zn concentrations as low as 0.11% .",
    "their analysis of the variation of the nel temperature versus doping concentration has shown the absence of a critical doping concentration for af ordering at zero temperature ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the goal of the present article is to understand this onset of long range af order at such low doping .",
    "this experimental observation questions the validity of existing theories in a much more drastic way than the coexistence of af order and dimerization .",
    "several distinct theories describe this coexistence of dimerization and antiferromagnetism .",
    "@xcite first proposed a model showing that the two orders can coexist , and another model was proposed by mostovoy _",
    "two of the present authors have proposed another model for the coexistence of af ordering and dimerization @xcite .",
    "all these theories successfully describe the coexistence of dimerization and af order upon doping , and they also show that the effect of doping amounts to generate states inside the spin - peierls gap , in agreement with susceptibility experiments ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "a similar behavior is reported in spin - ladder systems , which , in spite of having a large spin gap , undergo a nel transition upon very small doping .",
    "for instance srcu@xmath1o@xmath0 , with a spin gap of @xmath17 , has a finite @xmath18 already at @xmath19 zn doping @xcite . in",
    "these ladder compounds the low energy spin excitations induced by doping have also been revealed by a finite specific heat coefficient @xcite .    in their article ,",
    "manabe _ et al .",
    "_ pointed out that one energy scale emerging from our model ( denoted by @xmath20 , see sections [ sec : sus ] and [ sec : mean - field ] for its definition ) was many orders of magnitude lower than the nel temperature ( for instance at @xmath21 , @xmath22k whereas @xmath23mk has been measured @xcite ) .",
    "on the basis of the analysis of af fluctuations in the 1d model , we already suggested @xcite that this apparent inconsistence can be avoided if one makes a proper treatment of disorder averaging . in the present article ,",
    "we push further this analysis by estimating the nel temperature in the presence of interchain coupling , which turns the quasi - long - range af fluctuations of the 1d model into a longer range order .",
    "we prove by two different methods ( a mean field treatment of the interchain coupling , and a decimation procedure of the 2d disordered problem ) that the resulting nel temperature has the right order of magnitude .",
    "moreover , under both treatments , we show that there is no critical concentration for the establishment of af order . as it was shown by mostovoy _",
    "_ , this is not the case in their model , and we believe that this is not the case either in the approach by fukuyama _",
    "_ , further extended by yoshioka and suzumura @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the model in section [ sec : themodel ] , and discuss the experiments by manabe _",
    "the problem of interchain coupling is first solved in section [ sec : mean - field ] at the mean field level .",
    "section [ sec : renor ] is devoted to the decimation approach that goes beyond the mean field treatment of interchain interactions , and is more relevant for the extremely low doping situation .",
    "the picture of griffith - like antiferromagnetism emerges from this treatment : large af correlated clusters are formed when the temperature is decreased below the spin - peierls temperature , without infinite range ordering .",
    "a summary of our results is presented in section [ sec : conclusion ] together with a comparison with the approaches by mostovoy _",
    "@xcite , fukuyama _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and yoshioka and suzumura @xcite .",
    "we argue that these approaches would fail to properly describe the low doping behavior , whereas our description leads to af ordering at infinitesimal doping . since the analysis of the work by fukuyama _",
    "is more technically involved , we have kept the qualitative features for the concluding section while the technical aspects are left for the appendices .",
    "we start by briefly describing our model .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian of a dimerized heisenberg model . given the large anisotropy in the couplings ( for instance @xcite ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the chain axis , and",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 the two perpendicular directions , the nel temperature is mainly determined by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we therefore consider the hamiltonian of a dimerized heisenberg model in two dimensions , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 labels the sites along the chain and @xmath34 is the chain index .",
    "@xmath35 is the dimerization parameter which is staggered along the @xmath27 axis . in reality",
    ", frustration has to be added to get a reasonable agreement with the spin susceptibility data above @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this can be accomplished by introducing for instance a ( quite large ) next nearest neighbor exchange @xmath36 , which can result both from next nearest neighbor cu - cu superexchange and from the lattice quantum fluctuations .",
    "however , this additional complication is neglected in our present analysis .    when @xmath37 , each spin at an even site is coupled by a strong bond @xmath38 to the spin at its left , and by a weak bond @xmath39 to the spin at its right , both on the same chain .",
    "a finite gap between the singlet ground state and the lowest triplet excitation arises as soon as @xmath40 and @xmath41 is less than a critical value which depends on @xmath35 .",
    "this should be the case of the pure cugeo@xmath0 .",
    "we start by assuming that the most important effect of doping is that each impurity releases a free spin out of the dimerized singlet background .",
    "this behavior was anticipated in @xcite on the basis of exact diagonalization of small - size systems , and in ref .",
    "@xcite by more qualitative arguments ( see fig . [ mapping ] ) .",
    "further numerical works have confirmed this picture @xcite , and have shown its robustness when more realistic assumptions are made , such as quantum phonons or coupling to a 3d lattice dimerization @xcite , or next - nearest - neighbor frustration @xcite .",
    "the generation of spin-1/2 objects is most clearly seen for zn or mg doping and in the limit @xmath42 . as a first approximation ,",
    "the non magnetic ion cuts the chain into two segments , e.g. one starting with a weak bond , the other ending with a strong bond . in the former segment",
    ", a free spin-1/2 moment will appear localized at the boundary .",
    "even if we add a weak link across the non - magnetic ion , which couples the two end - spins of each segment , this free spin-1/2 moment still exists .",
    "an even more transparent explanation is obtained by considering a ring of even number of sites . since @xmath43 ,",
    "the ground state is a singlet with a gap to the lowest @xmath5 excitations .",
    "if a spin is removed , and a weak link across the empty site is added , the effective spin chain will now contain an odd number of spins 1/2 .",
    "hence the ground state will have @xmath4 , in spite of a finite gap to higher spin states .",
    "moreover , since translational symmetry is broken , this @xmath4 moment will be mostly localized around the weak link .",
    "similarly , even if one spin 1/2 is substituted by a spin 1 , modeling ni doping , a free spin 1/2 moment is formed around the impurity .",
    "we also believe that the same situation holds with a finite @xmath41 .",
    "the case of si - doping is less clear .",
    "ge is supposed to influence the superexchange between the cu s @xcite , increasing the antiferromagnetic superexchange with respect to the ferromagnetic indirect exchange , finally leading to a net @xmath44 .",
    "the smaller bond length of si - o has likely the effect of reducing the antiferromagnetic superexchange by diminishing the angle cu - o - cu , thus inducing defects in the dimerized structure . in principle , a large reduction of that angle might even change the sign of the cu - cu exchange constant , leading to the formation of free spin-1 moments .",
    "although we believe this is likely to occur , here we will limit our analysis to the simpler case of non magnetic ions substituting cu .",
    "we therefore take for granted the appearance of spin-1/2 moments upon doping , in the line of several numerical works ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) and pursue the next step which is to build up the phase diagram of doped cugeo@xmath0 from these excitations . this",
    "can not be done without including the effect of interactions between those spin-1/2 moments , which are central to our description .    as we argued , in such cases free spin-1/2 moments form around each impurity , showing up as low energy states inside the spin - peierls gap , which , at very low doping , is almost unchanged .",
    "therefore , we model the doped compounds as a two components system , where spins 1/2 are diluted inside a singlet background , characterized by a fixed gap between the singlet ground state and the first excited triplets .",
    "the virtual polarization of the singlet background provides an antiferromagnetic coupling between these spins .",
    "since the dimerized state is gaped , this coupling decays exponentially with the distance between two spins over a length of the order of the spin - peierls correlation length .",
    "for instance , let us consider two spins at a distance @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 being positive integers , and @xmath25 and @xmath27 the lattice constants in the chain and perpendicular to the chain directions .",
    "then , the exchange between these two impurity - released spins can be taken of the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the spin gap , @xmath50 @xcite the correlation length in lattice constant units along the c - axis , while @xmath51 , the correlation length along the b - axis .",
    "the oscillating factor in front takes into account the fact that the singlet background polarizes mostly in a staggered way , leading to a ferromagnetic exchange if the two spins are on the same sublattice and to an antiferromagnetic one in the opposite case . since the impurities are located at random , replacing a fraction @xmath11 of the magnetic sites , eq.([j ] )",
    "defines a two dimensional random heisenberg model , which should properly describe the excitations at energies below the spin - peierls gap .",
    "the above two - component model looses its validity at larger doping , where the impurities start to affect the singlet background in a non negligible way .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that at low doping it does capture the essential physics of the real system , giving a good description of the the nel transition .",
    "below some temperature , these weakly coupled spins will tend to order antiferromagnetically .",
    "moreover , they will also induce a staggered polarization on the singlet background , which does have a finite staggered susceptibility , in spite of an exponentially decaying uniform susceptibility . according to this scenario ,",
    "the nel phase would consist of spins antiferromagnetically ordered diluted in a partially polarized singlet background .",
    "the main problem is to get an estimate of the nel transition temperature , which allows a direct comparison of the present model with the experimental phase diagram of cu@xmath52zn@xmath53geo@xmath0 @xcite , where it has been shown that zero temperature af ordering occurs at an infinitesimal zn concentration .",
    "we first proceed by considering the extremely low doping susceptibility experiments by manabe _",
    "@xcite , which , to our knowledge are the only available with zn concentrations as low as @xmath54 . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nel temperatures ( see table [ table ] ) are indeed much larger than the _ typical energy scale _ @xmath20 , given by the nel temperature of a regular array of equally spaced spin-1/2 moments with an exchange given by eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) , which we may estimate by considering , instead of a random distribution , a regular distribution of the spins over the 2d lattice with a concentration @xmath11 .",
    "the coupling along the @xmath25 and @xmath27-axes are then @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , with @xmath57 the average distance between the spins .",
    "hence , at low doping , the effective heisenberg model describing the spins has a huge space anisotropy @xmath58 , implying that the scale controlling the nel temperature is @xmath59k if @xmath21 , which is far too small compared with the experimental values of the af transition temperatures .",
    "the typical energy scale @xmath20 can also be evaluated in the single chain version of our model , as recalled in section [ sec : mean - field ] .",

    "the reason why the nel temperature is not of the order of @xmath20 , but many orders of magnitude higher , is that , as a result of disorder in the spatial distribution of magnetic moments , clusters exist in the system with spins which are close to each other , being therefore strongly af correlated .",
    "once the interchain couplings will be included ( sections [ sec : mean - field ] and [ sec : renor ] ) , this will result in a nel temperature many orders of magnitude larger than @xmath20 .",

    "[ fig - corre ] , at intermediate temperatures @xmath110 the af correlation length is increased by disorder . above @xmath20 ,",
    "the disordered chain takes advantage of rare fluctuations in which many spins get closer than the average distance @xmath95 , thus forming af correlated clusters due to the exponential dependence of the exchange ( [ j ] ) upon the distance .",
    "the experimental values of the nel temperature ( see table [ table ] ) are clearly of the order of the average exchange @xmath78 , and not of the order of the typical exchange @xmath20 .",
    "the same is true for the characteristic exchange @xmath65 in ( [ eq : fit ] ) and the ( negative ) curie temperature @xmath68 in ( [ eq : curie ] ) .",
    "the orders of magnitude of @xmath65 and @xmath68 obtained in section [ sec : sus ] are in fact a proof of the relevance of disorder in the physics of the system .",
    "we now include the effect of an interchain coupling @xmath111k @xcite under the form of a mean field treatment based on the 1d model proposed and analyzed in refs . @xcite .",
    "as recalled in section [ sec:1d ] , the 1d version of our model does develop quasi - long - range af fluctuations , which is the reason why af order will be easily generated once an interchain coupling @xmath84 is taken into account . when the interchain exchange @xmath41 is switched on",

    "the question whether the nel order is a true long range order or a short range order will be discussed in more details in the light of the decimation calculation in section [ sec : renor ] .",
    "we look in the present section at the mean field response to a uniform staggered field , and therefore the nel order is infinite ranged , which is not the case when the interchain coupling is included beyhond the mean field treatement .    to get an estimate of the nel temperature , we use the following mean - field like equation for @xmath15 : @xmath112 where @xmath97 is the local staggered magnetic susceptibility ( [ eq : chis ] ) , and @xmath87 the correlation length drawn on fig .",

    "it is quite clear from the present calculation that the nel temperature @xmath15 is much larger that @xmath20 .",
    "this originates from the fact that large magnetically ordered clusters form already much above @xmath20 .",
    "this fact , together with the finite polarizability of the singlet dimerized background , explains the surprisingly high nel temperatures @xmath15 .",
    "we can even obtain a rougher estimate of the nel temperature .",
    "since @xmath113 , we can , in a first approximation , take the correlation length @xmath87 equal to the spin - peierls correlation length @xmath108 , and further assume that the susceptibility amounts to a paramagnetic contribution of the free magnetic moments : @xmath114 using eq.([eq - tn ] ) we obtain the nel temperature @xmath115 linear in the impurity concentration .",
    "taking @xmath116 , and @xmath117 and @xmath118 we get @xmath119 . at the same concentration , martin _ et al .",

    "these results will be further confirmed by the decimation analysis in section [ sec : renor ] .",
    "we now present a decimation scheme in 2d which allows to describe the physics at extremely low doping .",
    "we have already shown in section [ sec : mean - field ] that our model leads to correct orders of magnitude of the nel temperature .",
    "we do not believe this mean field theory to be valid at very low doping , since lowering the doping should enhance inhomogeneities , and we then do not expect the physics to be captured by a homogeneous staggered field involved in the mean - field stoner criterion ( [ eq - tn ] ) .",
    "this is why we now consider the full disordered problem in a fixed dimerized background .",
    "we take a square lattice of size @xmath121 , representing the initial cu sites of cugeo@xmath0 , which , without doping , are paired into a spin - peierls dimerized phase",
    ". some of these lattice sites will be occupied by non magnetic impurities with a probability @xmath11 , leaving in their vicinity unpaired spin 1/2 moments .",
    "the exchange coupling between two such spins at positions @xmath122 and @xmath123 is @xmath124 , where we take @xmath125 @xmath49 being the spin - peierls gap @xmath126 , and @xmath127 and @xmath128 the correlation lengths in the @xmath25 and @xmath27 directions , respectively .",
    "this model has no adjustable parameter .",
    "the exchange @xmath129 is negative if the two sites belong to the same sublattice , and positive otherwise , which takes into account the finite response of the singlet background to a staggered field .",
    "this defines a disordered spin model in 2d with long range interactions , in the sense that any spin has an exchange with any other , which however decays exponentially with their separation .",
    "the decimation procedure we use here is similar to the one used by bhatt and lee @xcite in the study of phosphorus doped silicon .",
    "however , we decimate strong bonds without renormalizing the exchanges , which is just sufficient to get the order of magnitude of the ordering temperature .    by construction , our model has bonds which are never frustrated and are perfectly compatible with a long range af order , being ferro on the same sublattice and antiferro on different sublattices .",
    "therefore we may not get the same low temperature properties found by bhatt and lee @xcite in their work on si : p .",
    "the reason of the difference is that our spins are diluted into a matrix which is easily af polarizable .",
    "a similar physics does not exist in si : p .      in one dimension ,",
    "a rg transformation of a random af spin chain consists in picking - up the strongest exchange of energy @xmath130 , decimate the two corresponding spins , and renormalize the exchange by projecting onto the singlet states of the decimated bonds .",
    "this leads to broad renormalized exchange distributions and to asymptotically exact low - energy physics @xcite .    similarly to the study on si : p by bhatt and lee @xcite , we carry out the same procedure in 2d , with the difference that we do not define a renormalized exchange but just eliminate the strong bonds .",
    "this approximation is expected to lead to qualitatively correct results as far as the estimate of the ordering temperature is concerned . considering the 2d disordered problem defined by the hamiltonian ( [ eq - exchange ] )",
    ", we decimate the bonds of strength @xmath131 . assuming the initial bonds were colored in white",
    ", we color in black these strongly coupled bonds .",
    "as the energy @xmath130 decreases , more and more white bonds will be turned into black , until the black bonds percolate throughout the system at an energy @xmath132 .",
    "we use @xmath132 as an estimate of the nel temperature @xmath15 , even though , strictly speaking , @xmath132 is an upper bound of the nel temperature . in practice , we use the following techniques to solve this problem numerically .",
    "( i ) the decimation is carried out by quick sorting the exchanges .",
    "( ii ) a linked list is built at each energy that encodes the graph of existing exchanges .",

    "we have tested our program with standard 2d site and bond percolation , with excellent results .",
    "we now present our results , by first showing in section [ sec : no - self ] the failure to find a percolating cluster in the infinite volume limit .",
    "we next consider in section [ sec : phase - diagram ] ordering in a finite coherence volume .      in this section ,",
    "we fix the impurity concentration @xmath11 and look for percolation in an initial lattice of size @xmath133 , with increasing sizes @xmath134 .",
    "given the anisotropy of the problem ( @xmath135 ) , percolation occurs along the @xmath11 direction of the strongest exchanges .",
    "it may happen that the left - most and right - most columns contain no impurity at low concentration , because of the finite probability @xmath136 to have an impurity present in a given column .",
    "we are thus lead to consider as percolating a cluster that percolates between the left - most and right - most columns that contain at least one impurity .    in order to determine the percolation probability , we consider two ( equivalent ) quantities .",
    "first the existence probability @xmath137 , i.e. the probability to find a percolating cluster in a system with a finite size @xmath134 .",
    "we also consider the binder cumulant @xmath138 , with @xmath139 the number of impurities in a percolating cluster .",
    "we analyze in this section the finite size scaling behavior of these two quantities .",
    "more precisely , if a true percolation transition would occur ( as it is the case in the 2d bond and site percolation problem ) , the crossing points either of @xmath140 or of @xmath141 for increasing sizes would accumulate at the transition temperature .",
    "we have plotted on figs .",
    "[ existence ] and [ binder ] the existence probability and binder cumulant for increasing sizes at a fixed impurity concentration @xmath142 . as it is visible on these figures",
    ", there is no true percolation transition in the sense that while the crossing point temperatures are higher and higher as the sizes increase , the existence probability decreases to zero .",
    "we interpret this result as the lack of true long range order in an infinite system .",
    "therefore , we believe that af ordering is of a griffith type .",
    "in fact , this finding is not unexpected . at a fixed energy @xmath143",
    ", we can interpret the diluted spins as particles with a core of area @xmath144 approximately given by @xmath145 the core is indeed elliptic , with a ratio between the axes @xmath146 .",
    "hence , the ratio between the area occupied by these particles and the surface sample is @xmath147 ignoring the complication due to the anisotropy , and assuming that the cores are impenetrable , a percolating cluster can only appear if @xmath148 where @xmath149 , being @xmath150 the site percolation threshold of a 2d square lattice .",
    "however , the core of each particle is not impenetrable . for this reason the existence probability does not approach one for increasing sizes even below @xmath151 .",
    "indeed , the existence probability @xmath152 for @xmath153 does not tend to a step function as for standard percolation , but to a smooth curve as it is visible from the finite size study shown on fig .",
    "[ existence ] .",
    "the previous analysis suggests that a true nel long range order is not established at very low doping , where the singlet background is assumed only to provide a coupling between the impurity released spins . as we said , for larger doping",
    ", the background will be much more influenced by the impurities , which , besides creating states inside the gap , would also reduce the main gap , making a true antiferromagnetic long range order competitive with respect to the spin - peierls phase , as discussed in the introduction .    nonetheless , the neutron beam that probes af ordering has a finite coherence length .",
    "therefore the relevant question , even at low doping , is not whether a true long range order exists , but rather if clusters of size larger than that coherence length appear , and with which probability .",
    "for this reason , we want now to discuss af ordering in a finite coherence volume , which , as we said , is set either by the size of the sample or by the finite coherence length of the experimental probe , e.g. the neutron beam .",

    "the above analysis suggests that at low doping the model does not have a true long range order in the thermodynamic limit , but the probability to find an ordered cluster of any given size @xmath134 is finite .",
    "this implies that the system will appear as if it were ordered to an external probe with a finite coherence length .",
    "this scenario gives a natural explanation of the fact that the measured nel temperatures are always much larger than the _ typical energy scale _ @xmath20 of the doped cugeo@xmath0 , and of the evidence that the intensity of the af peaks observed in neutron scattering is not saturated even at @xmath168 @xcite for a zn doped sample with @xmath169 .    to obtain the dependence of the susceptibility upon temperature , we would need to improve our decimation scheme by renormalizing the exchanges , similarly to ref .",

    "let us summarize the proposal we have presented for the onset of the nel long range order in doped cugeo@xmath0 .",
    "we first want to stress that , in our opinion , the real difficulty in the subject is not the coexistence of dimerization and antiferromagnetism , since the two order parameters are not incompatible . instead , what is puzzling is the appearance of antiferromagnetism at such low impurity concentration as @xmath171 , with a reasonably high transition temperature .",
    "we have shown that this behavior might depend on the peculiar properties of the disorder in this system , as well as in other spin gaped systems .",
    "we believe that the most important effect of disorder , at low doping , is to induce randomly distributed localized free moments .",
    "these moments are weakly coupled by an exchange constant exponentially decaying upon the distance , see eq.([j ] ) , caused by the virtual polarization of the singlet background .",
    "we have shown that even a single chain does develop quasi long range nel order , _",
    "i.e. _ a power law decaying staggered correlation function , which , we believe , does imply a low temperature transition to an af phase as soon as the interchain exchange is taken into account .",
    "moreover , we argued that the exponential dependence on the distance of the exchange between those randomly distributed moments implies that rare events in which the impurity released spins are closer than the average distance ( and therefore get strongly coupled ) , dominate the physics at low doping , in a griffith - like scenario .",
    "this picture was fully confirmed by an investigation of the 2d disordered problem using a decimation method .",
    "the formation of these griffith - like clusters , together with the finite staggered susceptibility of the singlet background , may explain why ordered domains larger that the neutron coherence length do appear at temperatures much larger than the temperature @xmath20 ( the exchange between two moments at a distance equal to the average one ) .",
    "some consequences can be drawn from this scenario :    * a nel transition is expected for any arbitrary small impurity concentration .",
    "* at relatively large doping concentrations , the mean field picture is expected to hold since the inhomogeneities of the af order are weak . in this concentration range",
    ", the nel temperature behaves like @xmath172 , where @xmath29 is the exchange constant in the @xmath27-direction , and @xmath108 the correlation length in the pure cugeo@xmath0 .",
    "* for low impurity concentrations , the nel state becomes highly inhomogeneous and the decimation method is more suited than the mean field theory . instead of a single transition temperature we find a quite broad distribution of @xmath15 s .",
    "we have indications that a true long range order is never established , so that the low temperature phase might be rather interpreted as a griffith - like antiferromagnet .",
    "we have shown that , for small coherence volumes , the nel temperature behaves like @xmath173 . by increasing the coherence volume ,",
    "this behavior does not rigorously hold . however , as it is visible on fig .",
    "[ fig - manabe ] , the behavior of the nel temperature for @xmath163 can hardly be discriminated from the @xmath155 calculation , and a fit of our results to a @xmath173 behavior would be equally satisfactory . * a very long correlation length in the c - axis direction , extending well above @xmath108 ,",
    "may be observed in a wide temperature range .",
    "this can be measured in nmr experiments at very low doping .",
    "for instance , the nmr linewidth in the ladder compound sr(cu@xmath52zn@xmath53)@xmath1o@xmath0 at a zn concentration @xmath174 , at which no nel transition has been observed down to the lowest accessible temperature , is two orders of magnitude larger than the correlation length of the undoped compound @xcite , which indicates that a similar behavior might well occur in the doped cugeo@xmath0 .",

    ", we make the following comments :    * the microscopic modeling of doping in a spin - peierls system is quite different in our model and in ref . @xcite . as we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite , our model is more related to a dimerization with a random telegraph noise of zero average distribution , with the low temperature physics dominated by the localized spins around the domain walls .",
    "* the physics of the 1d limit of both models is different .",
    "this can be seen by considering the rg flow @xcite .",
    "the 1d limit of the model by mostovoy _",
    "_ has been solved by hyman _",
    "@xcite , and flows to a fixed point with power - law griffith singularities .",
    "by contrast , the 1d limit of our model flows to the random singlet fixed point @xcite with logarithmic singularities @xcite . * more importantly , the random dimerized heisenberg chain , which is the starting point of the description in ref .",
    "@xcite , does _ not _ develop quasi long range af fluctuations , as it is the case in our proposal .",
    "this allows to understand why a finite critical concentration of impurities is required in ref .",
    "@xcite to generate an af - dimerized phase . as we show in the present article , this is not the case in our model , and it seems that this is not the case in experiments either @xcite .    a proposal similar to the one by mostovoy _",
    "_ was previously put forward by fukuyama , tanimoto and saito ( fts ) @xcite , who also worked out a model showing a coexistence of antiferromagnetism and dimerization , as well as the onset of antiferromagnetism for arbitrary small doping .",
    "as we discussed , we have started our analysis by assuming that the main effect of the impurities is the release of free spins out of the singlet background , which is in agreement with the magnetic susceptibility data on the doped compounds , showing an almost curie like component at low temperature which seems to scale linearly with doping ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) . instead , fts assume , as mostovoy _",
    ", that the main effect of disorder is the local reduction of the dimerization @xmath175 close to each impurity , hence of the spin gap .",
    "for instance , they can fit the experimental reduction of the scattering intensity from the dimerized lattice in the @xmath176 si doped compound , by taking @xmath177 .",
    "this leads to a rough estimate of the local reduction of the spin gap @xmath178 .",
    "obviously , for smaller impurity concentrations , one should expect an even smaller reduction of the spin gap .",
    "however , to explain within this model the almost curie like behavior of the low temperature susceptibility at low doping , one should assume a much stronger suppression of the spin gap down to @xmath179 close to each impurity , not just a small reduction as the fit to the neutron scattering data would imply .",
    "this is one reason why we believe that our approach is more relevant .",
    "the other is that we do not believe that a local reduction of the dimerization might explain the appearance of antiferromagnetism at such low concentration as @xmath180 of zn doping .",
    "in fact , a more realistic modeling of disorder in cugeo@xmath0 should include both disorder effects , the local reduction of dimerization as well as the appearance of free spins .",
    "essentially , the main difference between our approach and the fts one is in the different emphasis placed on the two effects .",
    "we believe that the main role at low doping in establishing the nel phase is played by the free moments induced by disorder , while fts seem to favor the other mechanism of a local reduction of the dimerization .",
    "apart from this comment on the grounds of the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also have some more technical criticisms . to analyze their model , fts use the so - called self consistent harmonic approximation ( scha ) applied to the bosonized version of a dimerized heisenberg chain .",
    "this approximation is a mean field theory , or saddle point approximation , plus random phase fluctuations . by this technique , they show the existence of a mean field solution having both a finite dimerization parameter and a finite nel order parameter . essentially , close to the impurity , where the dimerization parameter is assumed to be reduced , a staggered magnetic moment in the @xmath181-direction arises .",
    "we believe that this approach is not fully consistent , as we explain in detail in appendix a.    an alternative variational approach has recently been developed by yoshioka and suzumura @xcite for the zn doping case .",
    "they have rigorously shown that in bosonization the spin - lattice coupling does change sign crossing a non magnetic impurity , as it was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . with this disorder modeling",
    "they have proved the existence of a variational action which does again describe a state where the dimerization gets reduced around an impurity and at the same time a static staggered moment appears in the @xmath181-direction .",
    "we believe that this variational approach gives a reasonable description of the nel ordered phase , very close to what we propose , but does not allow a description of how the af ordering occurs , which we did in the present work .",
    "we postpone to appendix [ ap : solitons ] a detailed discussion of this point , and we end - up with two simple comments on these semiclassical analyzes .    the dimerized phase breaks translational invariance like a nel phase does , which , in addition , also breaks spin symmetry . if one analyzes the role of defects in a dimerized state within a scheme which breaks su(2 ) symmetry ( what is implicitly done in those semiclassical approaches , as shown in appendix [ ap : solitons ] ) , it is not a surprise that a finite staggered magnetization comes out of the calculation ( without spin anisotropy or an applied staggered magnetic field ) , since the dimerized state already breaks translational symmetry .    finally , one can work out a model in the spirit of the fts scenario .",
    "this can be done by considering a dimerization distributed as a telegraph noise , and taking a value @xmath35 in the dimerized background ( large segments ) , and @xmath182 close to the impurities ( short segments ) .",
    "the resulting disordered model can be exactly solved in the xx limit along the lines in ref .",
    "this would result in a model with power - law griffith singularities , equivalent to the model by mostovoy _",
    "@xcite , and inequivalent to our model where the dyson singularities are power - law .",

    "were @xmath276 be present , we would indeed find a coexistence of dimer order and nel one , the latter mainly localized close to the domain wall .",
    "we have now all the elements to describe what happens in this solvable model for the classical phase , and compare with the variational approach of ref .",
    "we start reminding that after the jordan - wigner transformation , a site occupied by a spinless fermion corresponds to a the spin having a @xmath181-component @xmath277 , while an empty site to @xmath278 .",
    "moreover , a chain with periodic boundary conditions is compatible with the presence of a single domain wall only if it has an odd number of sites .",
    "therefore the ground state has a total @xmath4 . in our xx - limit",
    "we can not rigorously discuss the su(2 ) symmetry , but at least the following discussion gives some hints how the implementation of such symmetry gives a classical phase @xmath250 independent of the position .",
    "in fact , if we take a ground state which does not break the symmetry , we have to assume that the chemical potential crosses exactly the soliton energy , so that there is an equal probability to have @xmath279 .",
    "in other words this implies that @xmath280 , leading to a vanishing @xmath276 , and leaving only the @xmath281 term which has indeed a phase fixed at @xmath250 .",
    "let us suppose a domain wall and an anti - domain wall at a distance much larger that @xmath282 .",
    "we can now consider a periodic chain with an even number of sites .",
    "the ground state will be a singlet . around each domain wall",
    "there will be a localized soliton state at zero energy .",
    "the two @xmath4 solitons will be coupled by the polarization of the background , generating a singlet @xmath283 as well as a triplet @xmath5 state . the singlet state has energy @xmath284 ( @xmath285 ) , the @xmath286 component of the triplet @xmath287 , and the @xmath288 have energy zero , where @xmath289 decays exponentially with the distance among the two domain walls .",
    "the fact that the triplet is not degenerate is a consequence of the xx - limit . in this case , however , we are lucky since the lowest energy state , being a singlet , is su(2 ) invariant .",
    "this is in essence why the spin anisotropy with a random distribution of domain walls does not play a very relevant role for what it regards the ground state properties . within the lowest energy singlet state",
    ", each soliton state has an equal probability of being empty or occupied , leading again to a vanishing @xmath276 eq.([finale ] ) .",
    "however , one can view the singlet state as oscillating between two configurations each having @xmath290 , hence a classical phase @xmath274 compatible with a nel order .",
    "in a rough picture , the system is locally , in time , in one of the two possible nel ordered states , and oscillates between them over a very long time scale @xmath291 .",
    "moreover , in spite of the exponential decay of the polarization over a length @xmath292 , which is the correlation length of the dimerized state , the two solitons , which are at a distance much larger that @xmath108 , oscillate coherently .",
    "this is on a very small scale our picture of what happens in the doped cugeo@xmath0 .",
    "we think that the variational approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is able to describe only the states where one soliton is occupied and the other is empty , or viceversa , and not the superposition of the two , which is beyond a mean field like approach",
    ". therefore the method implicitly breaks su(2 ) symmetry , which obviously leads to a finite staggered magnetization @xmath276 , since already the dimerized state breaks the translational invariance . for this reason ,",
    "we believe that this approach should give a reasonable description of the nel ordered phase , but is unable to describe the way in which the magnetic ordering is established , which is what we have done in this work .",
