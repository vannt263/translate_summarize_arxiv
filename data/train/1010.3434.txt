    "neutrinos do not interact with photons in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , minimal extension of the sm with massive neutrinos yields neutrino - photon and neutrino - two photon interactions through radiative corrections @xcite . despite the fact that minimal extension of the sm induces very small couplings , there are several models beyond the sm predicting relatively large neutrino - photon and neutrino - two photon couplings .",
    "electromagnetic properties of the neutrinos have important implications on particle physics , astrophysics and cosmology . therefore probing electromagnetic structure of the neutrinos at colliders",
    "is important for understanding the physics beyond the sm and contributes to the studies in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) generates high energetic proton - proton collisions with a high luminosity .",
    "it is commonly believed that it will help to answer many fundamental questions in particle physics . recently",
    "a new phenomenon called exclusive production was observed in the measurements of cdf collaboration @xcite and its physics potential has being studied at the lhc @xcite .",
    "complementary to proton - proton interactions , studies of exclusive production might be possible and opens new field of studying very high energy photon - photon and photon - proton interactions .",
    "therefore it is interesting to investigate the potential of lhc as a photon collider to probe the electromagnetic properties of the neutrinos .    atlas and cms collaborations have a program of forward physics with extra detectors located at distances of 220 m and 420 m from the interaction point @xcite .",
    "range of these 220 m and 420 m detectors overlap and they can detect protons in a continuous range of @xmath2 where @xmath2 is the proton momentum fraction loss defined by the formula , @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the momentum of incoming proton and @xmath5 is the momentum of intact scattered proton .",
    "atlas forward physics ( afp ) collaboration proposed an acceptance of @xmath6 .",
    "there are also other scenarios with different acceptances of the forward detectors .",
    "cms - totem forward detector scenario spans @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "one of the well - known application of the forward detectors is the high energy photon - photon fusion .",
    "this reaction is produced by two quasireal photons emitted from protons . since the emitted quasireal photons have a low virtuality they do not spoil the proton structure .",
    "therefore scattered protons are intact and forward detector equipment allows us to detect intact scattered protons after the collision .",
    "the photon - photon fusion can be described by equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) @xcite . in the framework of epa , emitted",
    "photons have a low virtuality and scattered with small angles from the beam pipe .",
    "therefore they are almost real and the cross section for the complete process @xmath8 can be obtained by integrating the cross section for the subprocess @xmath9 over the effective photon luminosity @xmath10    @xmath11    where w is the invariant mass of the two photon system and the effective photon luminosity is given by the formula @xmath12 with @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the energy of one of the emitted photons from the proton , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the functions of the equivalent photon spectra .",

    "the magnetic moment of the proton is taken to be @xmath22 . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are functions of the electric and magnetic form factors . in the above epa formula ,",
    "electromagnetic form factors of the proton have been taken into consideration .    in this work",
    "we investigate the potential of exclusive @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions at the lhc to probe @xmath25 and @xmath26 couplings .",
    "we obtain model independent bounds on these couplings considering dirac neutrinos . during numerical analysis",
    "we assume that center of mass energy of the proton - proton system is @xmath27 tev .",
    "non - standard @xmath25 interaction can be described by the following dimension 6 effective lagrangian @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the magnetic moment of @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath32 is the transition magnetic moment . in the above effective lagrangian new physics energy scale @xmath33",
    "is absorbed in the definition of @xmath29 .",
    "the most general dimension 7 effective lagrangian describing @xmath26 coupling is given by @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are dimensionless coupling constants .",
    "current experimental bounds on neutrino magnetic moment are stringent .",
    "the most sensitive bounds from neutrino - electron scattering experiments with reactor neutrinos are at the order of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "bounds derived from solar neutrinos are at the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "bounds on magnetic moment can also be derived from energy loss of astrophysical objects .",
    "these give about an order of magnitude more restrictive bounds than reactor and solar neutrino probes @xcite .",
    "neutrino - two photon coupling has been less studied in the literature .",
    "current experimental bounds on this coupling are derived from rare decay @xmath40 @xcite and the analysis of @xmath41 conversion @xcite .",
    "lep data on @xmath40 decay sets an upper bound of @xcite @xmath42 ^ 6 \\sum_{i , j , k}\\left(|\\alpha^{ij}_{rk}|^2+|\\alpha^{ij}_{lk}|^2\\right)\\leq2.85\\times10^{-9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the analysis of the primakoff effect on @xmath41 conversion in the external coulomb field of the nucleus @xmath43 yields about two orders of magnitude more restrictive bound than @xmath44 decay @xcite .    in the presence of the effective interactions ( [ nunuphoton ] ) and ( [ nunuphotonphoton ] ) , @xmath45 scattering is described by three tree - level diagrams .",
    "the polarization summed amplitude square is given by the following simple formula @xmath46 where s , t and u are the mandelstam variables and we omit the mass of neutrinos . in the above amplitude we also neglect interference terms between interactions ( [ nunuphoton ] ) and ( [ nunuphotonphoton ] ) .",
    "neutrinos are not detected directly in the central detectors . instead",
    ", their presence is inferred from missing energy signal .",
    "therefore statistical analysis has to be performed with some care .",
    "any sm process with final states which are not detected by the central detectors can not be discerned from @xmath47 .",
    "atlas and cms have central detectors with a pseudorapidity coverage @xmath48 .",
    "the sm processes with final state particles scattered with very large angles from the beam pipe may exceed the angular range of the central detectors .",
    "hence any sm process with final states in the interval @xmath49 should be accepted as a background for @xmath45 .",
    "there are also other sources of backgrounds .",
    "the one which may affect our results is the instrumental background due to calorimeter noise .",
    "the calorimeter noise can be effectively suppressed by imposing a cut on the transverse energy of the jets . according to ref.@xcite",
    "the calorimeter noise is negligible for jets with a transverse energy greater than 40 gev ( @xmath50 gev ) .",
    "of course the calorimeter noise is not the only factor which affects the jet efficiency .",
    "based on @xcite we take into account a global efficiency of 0.6 .",
    "this is actually a prudent value for the global efficiency .",
    "we have considered the following background processes : @xmath51 our backgrounds can be arranged into three classes :    ( 1)- @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath49 for all final charged particles .",
    "( 2)-@xmath53 and @xmath55 with @xmath49 for final charged leptons and @xmath48 , @xmath56 gev for final quarks , i.e. , final quarks with @xmath56 gev are assumed to be missing even for @xmath48 .",
    "( 3)-we assume that 40% of the number of events from reactions @xmath53 and @xmath57 with @xmath49 for final charged leptons and @xmath48 , @xmath50 gev for final quarks is missing .",
    "among all the background processes the biggest contribution comes from electron - positron production with @xmath49 .",
    "the reason originates from the fact that the cross section is highly peaked in the forward and backward directions due to small mass of the electron and @xmath58 pole structure .",
    "the sum of all background cross sections is @xmath59 pb for @xmath7 and @xmath60 pb for @xmath6 .",
    "we have estimated 95% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "bounds using one - parameter @xmath61 test without a systematic error .",
    "sm prediction about missing number of events is @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 is the integrated luminosity , 0.9 is the qed two - photon survival probability and @xmath64 is the sum of all background cross sections . in order to test sm prediction we use the following @xmath61 function : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the cross section for the process @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the statistical error .    in tables",
    "[ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] , we show 95% c.l .",
    "upper bounds of the couplings @xmath69 and @xmath70 . as we have mentioned , diagonal elements @xmath29 are strictly constrained by the experiments .",
    "if we assume that @xmath31 is diagonal then our limits are many orders of magnitude worse than the current experimental limits . on the other hand we see from the tables that our bounds on @xmath71 are approximately at the order of @xmath72 .",
    "it is 7 orders of magnitude more restrictive than the lep bound .",
    "as we have mentioned , during statistical analysis we consider the background processes given in ( [ background ] ) .",
    "the main contribution is provided by the processes @xmath73 with @xmath49 .",
    "of course there are other backgrounds that we have not taken into account . but",
    "these others are expected to give relatively small contributions .",
    "furthermore , even a large background does not spoil our limits significantly .",
    "for instance , if we assume that background cross section is 4 times larger than the sum of all backgrounds that we have considered , our limits are spoiled only a factor of 2 .",
    "they are still at the order of @xmath72 .    the subprocess @xmath74 is described by 8 tree - level diagrams containing effective @xmath25 and @xmath26 couplings ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the analytical expression for the amplitude square is quite lengthy so we do not present it here . but",
    "it depends on the couplings of the form ; @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 where we assume that @xmath78 ; @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 is absent in the sm at the tree - level .",
    "sm contribution is originated from loop diagrams involving 5 vertices .",
    "since the sm contribution is very suppressed it is appropriate to set bounds on the couplings using a poisson distribution .",
    "the expected number of events has been calculated considering the leptonic decay channel of the z boson as the signal @xmath81 , where @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "we also place a cut of @xmath48 for final state @xmath84 and @xmath83 .",
    "upper bounds of the couplings @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath69 are presented in tables [ tab3 ] and [ tab4 ] .",
    "we observe from the tables that the subprocess @xmath74 provides approximately an order of magnitude more restrictive bounds on @xmath87 coupling with respect to @xmath88 . on the other hand",
    "both processes have almost same potential to probe the coupling @xmath89 .",
    "forward detector equipments allow us to study lhc as a high energy photon collider . by use of forward detectors",
    "we can detect intact scattered protons after the collision .",
    "therefore deep inelastic scattering which spoils the proton structure , can be easily discerned from the exclusive photo - production processes .",
    "this provides us an opportunity to probe electromagnetic properties of the neutrinos in a very clean environment .",
    "we show that exclusive @xmath90 and @xmath91 reactions at the lhc probe neutrino - two photon couplings with a far better sensitivity than the current limits .",
    "former reaction improves the sensitivity limits by up to a factor of @xmath92 and latter improves a factor of @xmath93 with respect to lep limits .",
