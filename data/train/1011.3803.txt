    ", it has yielded new insights into photo - induced dynamics of electronic excited states of small molecules @xcite , polymers @xcite , large photosynthetic aggregates @xcite and even solid state systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , long living electronic coherence has been detected in energy transfer dynamics of photosynthetic proteins @xcite , a find that stimulated a renewed interest in the properties of energy transfer in biological systems and its arguably quantum nature .",
    "most 2d experiments are well described by the third order perturbation semiclassical light - matter interaction response function theory .",
    "simulations must include dephasing of electronic coherence and electronic energy transfer between levels which are both induced by interaction of the electronic _ degrees of freedom _",
    "( dof ) with environment ( bath ) .",
    "response functions of model few level systems with pure dephasing ( no energy transfer between the levels ) can be calculated using second cumulant in magnus expansion @xcite , and expressed in terms of the _ energy gap correlation function _ ( egcf ) , @xmath0 . for gaussian stochastic bath , this result is exact , and the egcf of the electronic transitions thus determines fully both the linear and the non - linear ( transient ) absorption spectra . for energy transferring systems , such as frenkel excitons in photosynthetic complexes @xcite ,",
    "the exact response functions can not be constructed by second cumulant .",
    "photosynthetic complexes are relatively large , and the proper methods to simulate finite timescale stochastic fluctuations at finite temperatures @xcite carry a substantial numerical cost .",
    "stochastic simulations can thus be readily implemented only for small systems @xcite .",
    "an explicite inclusion of some important environmental modes into the hamiltonian also increases the size of the system beyond feasibility .",
    "practical calculations thus require some type of reduced dynamics where only electronic dof are treated explicitly . a convenient form of the reduced dynamics , master equations , is realized by deriving kinetic equations for expectation values of relevant quantities averaged over the dof of the bath @xcite .",
    "if these quantities ( such as transition dipole moment ) do not depend on the bath dof , all relevant information is carried by the _ reduced density matrix _ ( rdm ) .",
    "it was demonstrated that rdm master equations derived by projection operator technique reproduce the linear response exactly @xcite . for higher order response",
    ", however , the same approach neglects bath correlation between different time intervals of the molecular photo - induced evolution separated by interaction with laser pulses ( see e.g. section 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "standard rdm master equations do not properly account for the non - equilibrium state of the phonon bath present after the second and the third laser pulse .",
    "this neglect can lead to a complete loss of the experimentally observed dynamics in simulated 2d spectra , such as in the case of the vibrational line shape modulation of a single electronic transition @xcite .",
    "this modulation interplays with simultaneous effect of electronic coherence .",
    "accounting reliably for bath correlations among intervals is therefore of utmost importance for interpretation of the role of quantum coherence in natural light - harvesting .",

    "the two approaches lead to the same exact results for a system of non - interacting molecules . for a coupled system ,",
    "the quality of the equations of motion derived by the two approaches has to be compared in a separate study .",
    "however , the central idea of the projector approach , i.e. its choice in a form which satisfied @xmath87 , is general , and it does not limit the present method to the three projectors suggested above . depending on physical situation , we expect that specialized projectors can be introduced for interacting systems , possibly based on the comparison with the results of ref . @xcite .",
