    "a useful metric for quantifying activity in a galaxy is the specific sfr ( ssfr , sfr per unit stellar mass , sfr / m@xmath7 ) .",
    "this represents an efficiency of star - formation , since it measures the observed star - formation rate relative to that which it must have had in the past in order to build up the observed amount of stellar mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the local universe , a correlation between the ssfr and stellar mass",
    "is observed @xcite , such that lower mass galaxies exhibit higher ssfrs than their higher mass counterparts .",
    "a similar trend is also seen at higher redshifts @xcite , with the overall normalisation of this relation shifting to higher ssfrs at earlier cosmic times .",
    "one result of this evolving relation is that the number of galaxies exceeding some ssfr threshold shifts from higher to lower mass galaxies with increasing cosmic time , generally referred to as ` cosmic downsizing ' @xcite , or ` downsizing in ( s)sfr ' .",
    "the evolution of this relation between ssfr and mass represents an important test of galaxy formation models , since both sfr and stellar mass depend critically on the prescriptions used for star - formation and mechanisms (  feedback \" ) which act to suppress it .",
    "thus , observations which measure how ssfr and stellar mass are related and evolve with cosmic time are required to constrain such models . several observational limitations to building such a study exist .",
    "possibly the most serious of these is the use of different sfr indicators which have different sensitivities to unobscured ( e.g. , uv , , ) and obscured star - formation ( e.g. , far infra - red emission , fir ) ; additional dependencies , such as metallicity ( e.g. , ) ; and contamination from non - starforming sources .",
    "the need to span a wide redshift range often means that different indicators must be used at different redshifts within a given survey , necessitating switching between different indicators , in which case systematic differences between the indicators might masquerade as evolution .",
    "previous studies of ssfr  mass and its evolution have used either mixtures of different sfr indicators ( e.g. , @xcite ) , photometric redshifts which require sfr , redshift and dust extinction , etc . to be estimated , in an often degenerate way , from the same set of data ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "many studies also use stacking techniques , in which case contamination from a subset of objects ( such as agn ) is often difficult to detect , and suffers from the limitation that only the average property of the stacked sample may be estimated ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "so , it is important to check that @xmath21=24.0 is bright enough to sample the z@xmath61 star - forming galaxies of interest . in paper 2 , we used photometric redshifts to show that galaxies potentially within our redshift range with sfrs below our  selection threshold likely do not significantly contribute to the global sfrd at z@xmath61 . pushing these photo - z s to fainter fluxes to attempt to locate galaxies below our @xmath21=24.0 limit with stellar masses",

    "thus , a linear extrapolation of the ( median - smoothed ) relation around this mass towards the @xmath08.5 limit gives some indication of how the average relation should look in the absence of any possible selection bias .",
    "the average relation ( measured by a running median of 15 objects ) agrees reasonably well with the linear extrapolation from brighter magnitudes , indicating that the bulk of objects at the @xmath08.5 mass limit are likely above the @xmath21=24 magnitude limit . assuming the scatter in magnitude at a given mass remains constant , a visual estimate from this plot suggest that mass incompleteness at the magnitude limit will be minimal .",
    "attempting to quantify this , fading galaxies at @xmath69.5 to @xmath08.5 assuming the same mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) as the higher mass galaxies , a maximum of 25% of these objects would fall below the @xmath21-band magnitude cut - off .",

    "the difference between a sfr of 0.3  and 0.1  ( the former being the approximate roles limit and the latter thus being a factor of three below the nominal limit ) corresponds to a systematic offset of 0.4 mag in observed @xmath21 .",

    "@xcite showed that the -sfrs could be empirically corrected to agree statistically with the -derived sfrs , but that the depth of the sdss spectroscopy led to incompleteness for high mass galaxies when  was used as the sfr indicator , due to the reduced sensitivity of  to sfr with increasing m@xmath7 .",

    "however , when the low mass roles data are included , an upturn in the relation at lower masses is seen .    in order to verify that this upturn is significant , a bootstrap technique is used to perform 1000 realisations of the z@xmath61 data .",
    "the bootstrap error bars for each data point are comparable with , or smaller than , the 1@xmath35 sampling errors shown in the plot .",
    "furthermore , if the approximate mid - points of the lower and higher mass samples , given by simply taking the centre - most bins of the roles and fors2 data ( i.e. , @xmath09.0 and @xmath010.6 ) , then the lower mass sample is always significantly higher than than the higher mass bin in all but two of the 1000 simulations . if a weighted mean of all three bins in the low and high mass samples is considered , then this would strengthen the significance further .",
    "the main uncertainty between the lower and higher mass data is likely to be systematic in nature ( discussed in  [ sec : discuss ] ) , and so we also consider the following bootstrap test .",
    "the null hypothesis that the data in the lowest mass bin is in fact the same as that of the highest mass roles bin , @xmath69.2 , ( i.e. , that the z@xmath01 ssfr  mass relation is in fact flat and that the observed upturn is artificial ) is adopted .",
    "data points from the @xmath69.2 bin are taken and bootstrap resampled , with the lowest 25% of these points removed each time ( making the conservative assumption that the @xmath23 25% incompleteness , estimated in  [ sec : masscompl ] , systematically occurs for the lowest ssfr values ) .",
    "this generates a new mean ssfr value in each realisation which is obviously systematically higher than that without the lower points removed . in 1000 realisations ,",
    "only seven are as high as the mean ssfr observed in the data for the lowest mass roles point . a limit to this bias",

    "we emphasize again that this test is likely conservative , since it assumes that the distribution of @xmath68.5 galaxies is exactly the same as those of @xmath69.2 galaxies , and that the 25% lowest ssfr galaxies are removed in each bootstrap realisation .",
    "the fact that we measure an upturn in this data is therefore intriguing but not can not be completely dismissed as due to selection effects , and can only be addressed with even deeper k - band data in future mass - selected samples .",

    "the low - mass end was an approximate by - eye fit to the bulk of the data points .",
    "interestingly , if we combine our highly complete ( @xmath480% ) low - mass data with the deep2/aegis data a very different dependence is found ( see  [ sec : ssfrmass2 ] ) .    with the values fitted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ssfrmass ] , the typical @xmath56 for a galaxy of @xmath0[9 , 11 ] at z@xmath01 would be [ 1.7 , 4.0 ] with @xmath73[34 , 4 ] gyr ; or for galaxies with these masses at z@xmath00.1 , the corresponding values would be @xmath74[1.1 , 3.7 ] and @xmath73[64 , 5 ] gyr .",
    "so , the upturn seen in the z@xmath61 ssfr  mass relation towards lower masses can be explained by a non - zero @xmath69 ,",
    "i.e. , the formation redshift was more recent for lower mass galaxies .",
    "although a linear fit ( @xmath75 ) in log  log space is permitted (  [ sec : ssfrmass ] ) , the higher mass points all lie systematically above the linear fit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ssfrmass ] , right panel ) and lower mass points systematically below , favouring the current parameterisation . with only the higher mass data used in other spectroscopic surveys , it is unlikely that this upturn could be detected .",
    "consider the implications for the mass function of star - forming galaxies (  [ sec : mf ] ) .",
    "in this toy model , individual star - forming galaxies are increasing in stellar mass : a typical @xmath09 galaxy at z@xmath01 would increase its stellar mass by @xmath230.5 dex by z@xmath00.1 and a @xmath011 galaxy at z@xmath01 by @xmath230.1 dex .",
    "some fraction of galaxies must also have their star - formation terminated and leave the blue cloud @xcite .",
    "these effects would act so as to shift the exponential cut - off of the mass function towards higher masses ( and to shift the low mass tail toward higher masses by a larger amount ) , and to decrease the overall normalisation of the mass function , respectively .",
    "therefore processes must be occurring in order to balance these effects , preserving the apparent constancy of the mass function @xcite .      in order to gain some insight into the processes which might be responsible for the above results , we compare the observations with a recent semi - analytic model of galaxy formation , the galform model of @xcite , implemented within the millennium @xmath76-body simulation .",
    "this is a version of the durham semi - analytic model which includes feedback from agn to quench cooling within massive haloes .",
    "firstly we add additional data in order to test the model over a wider redshift baseline (  [ sec : adddata ] ) , and recast the ssfr ",
    "mass results in a manner more directly related to the predictions made by the model (  [ sec : timescale ] ) .      to the @xmath77 and @xmath78 data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : timescale ] ( blue and black points , respectively ) , we add higher redshift data at @xmath79 from two bx galaxy surveys ( sawicki & thompson 2006 ; and reddy & steidel 2009 , red squares and circles , respectively ) .",
    "these @xmath80 samples are used to extend the redshift baseline of our comparisons .",
    "it is important to note that the two stellar mass functions at @xmath80 are derived in a different way from those at lower redshifts .",
    "the sawicki ( 2010 ) mf is obtained from the bx galaxy lf using an empirical @xmath81-stellar mass relation .",
    "this relation has been derived from a small but deep sample of @xmath80 galaxies in the hubble deep field for which stellar masses were estimated from multi - wavelength ( @xmath82 through @xmath83 ) sed fitting , and which takes the form @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "sawicki ( 2011 ) use it to infer a stellar mass function from a revised version of the sawicki & thompson ( 2006 ) @xmath80 uv lf that has been updated to take into account luminosity - dependent dust effects .",
    "we follow the same approach but apply the mass - luminosity relation to the original lf ( sawicki & thompson 2006 ) .",
    "this lf has a somewhat shallower faint - end slope than the updated lf ; together with the reddy & steidel ( 2009 ) result ( below ) , which comes from a steeply - rising z@xmath62 lf , the two results span a conservatively wide plausible range of z@xmath62 possibilities . at their faint / low - mass end , reddy & steidel ( 2009 ) follow a similar approach and an earlier version of the same hdf - based mass calibration .",
    "specifically , at the low - luminosity end they correct their bx galaxy lf using their prescription for magnitude - dependent dust and then apply the sawicki et al .",
    "( 2007 ; see also sawicki 2011 ) sfr - stellar mass relation to arrive at the low - mass end of the mf ; at the bright / massive end , they use stellar masses obtained from sed fitting for individual galaxies in their large sample of bx galaxies .",
    "the studies at @xmath79 have several key differences from our study at lower redshift .",
    "the principal of these is that stellar masses are not derived for individual galaxies , as is the case at lower redshifts , but rather stellar mass densities are calculated from uv lfs and empirical stellar mass - @xmath81 ( or stellar - mass - sfr ) relations  an approach that can propagate significant scatter ( @xmath85 dex ) into the results . additionally , these conversions are based on the assumption of a single , constant star formation history in the sed fitting .",
    "finally , it should be kept in mind that both the @xmath80 samples rely on essentially the same stellar mass - @xmath81 relation and the chief differences in the results stem from differences in their somewhat different uv luminosity functions .      as shown in eqn .",

    "the zcosmos - measured spectroscopic total mass function @xcite agrees well with the @xcite measurement where they overlap at higher masses .",
    "results at lower masses , where the photo - z estimate of the total mass function is not tested , should be regarded as the largest possible systematic error in the comparison with the models .",

    "indeed , the models and the data seem to agree best around the value of this transition mass . at z@xmath00.1 , at higher and lower masses , the model predicts somewhat higher values of the past - average to present sfr . we will return to this point below .",
    "also , towards lower masses at z@xmath01.0 , the model is consistent with the individual measurement uncertainties and the sfrd errors in fig .",

    "[ fig : ssfrmass ] which is driving our fit of a tau model with non - zero @xmath69 . at low masses",
    ", almost all galaxies should be star - forming at the level we can measure and so differences due to the roles data only selecting star - forming galaxies and galform selecting all galaxies should be negligible .",
    "it is also worth noting that feedback from agn is negligible in the models for low mass galaxies and so , whereas these effects could both play a part in the disagreement at the high mass end , the disagreement at the low mass end is pointing to inadequacies in the modelled physics for low mass galaxies .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to examine in detail what processes might be responsible , but we note that effects such as over - quenching for satellite galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) may be at least partly responsible , and we point modellers to the current low mass data as an important test of galaxy formation theories .",

    "indeed , almost 70% of the total sfrd at each epoch occurs above this mass limit . at @xmath69.5 ,",
    "the z@xmath01 distribution drops below that of the local value .",
    "this may be due to inadequate sampling of galaxies in this mass range , as this is the point around which the fors2 data end and the roles data begin . at the low mass limits of the data ,",

    "this reflects the upturns we see in figs .",

    "if the deficit around @xmath69.5 is due to a paucity of these mass galaxies in our sample , then the excess measured here is likely even higher than 5% .",

    "they found that the same trend was seen in the @xcite models , as it also appears to be in galform from the parallel nature of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : timescale ] .",
    "@xcite also used the dimensionless growth rate ( @xmath95 ) , i.e. , closely related to the inverse of the star formation timescale divided by the age of the universe at the redshift of interest ( and the inverse of @xcite s @xmath48 ) , as the observational quantity to compare with semi - analytic models of galaxy formation .",
    "the predictions were made by @xcite which are based on the model of @xcite .",
    "as with the @xcite model , these semi - analytic prescriptions are applied to the millennium simulation .",
    "@xcite found that the growth rate was in good agreement with the models at z@xmath60 , but that the growth rate in the observations increased much faster than those of the models .",
    "the @xcite model seems to predict a much flatter evolution in the growth rate / timescale than the @xcite model over the redshift range considered here ( compare fig .  1 of @xcite with fig . 7 of @xcite model ) .",
    "thus , although both semi - analytic models qualitatively reproduce the downsizing trend in cosmic star - formation , they both fail to reproduce important details : the @xcite predicts too slow a rate of the growth of stellar mass due to star - formation , although the values for different galaxy masses at z@xmath00 are quite accurately predicted ; whereas the @xcite model predicts approximately the correct growth rate for all but the most massive galaxies ( @xmath9311 ) , underpredicting the local sfrd in high mass galaxies . conceivably these shortcomings could be due to similar factors , however a detailed investigation into the semi - analytic models is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "@xcite and others ( e.g. , @xcite ) have claimed that the evolution in growth rate , or equivalently ssfr , is the same for galaxies of all masses .",
    "if our limiting mass was higher ( more like @xmath939.5 ) we would have reached similar results .",
    "our lower mass sample identifies an upturn in average ssfr at lower masses which we interpret as evidence for a later formation epoch for lower mass galaxies in our toy - modelling .",
    "our measurements are most robust for low mass galaxies , for the reasons mentioned above .",
    "more uncertainty exists when results for high mass galaxies are included .",
    "the high mass data used comes from public spectroscopy of the cdfs .",
    "this is a relatively small field ( which is especially problematic for the rarer , high mass galaxies ) and these data have a sampling completeness of @xmath2350% ( and an overall completeness , including the redshift success rate , of @xmath2330% ) .",
    "however , the agreement between the cdfs data and the larger zcosmos survey converted to the same empirically - corrected -sfr tracer gives reassurance that cosmic variance does not have a significant impact on these results ( appendix [ sec : ssfrmass2 ] ) .",
    "another concern is how well the empirically - corrected -luminosity traces the total ( i.e. extinction - corrected ) sfr .",
    "the calibration is known to give good agreement between extinction - corrected -sfrs at z@xmath60.1 @xcite , where the extinction has been calibrated either by the balmer decrement or ir luminosity .",
    "the disagreement between the deep2/aegis ssfrs and the current dataset ( see appendix  [ sec : ssfrmass2 ] ) at the high mass end might suggest that the empirically - corrected -sfrs are missing extinguished star - formation detected in the 24@xmath94 m observations ( but note that the dicrepancy still persists for -only sfrs ) ; or recent suggestions that the rest - frame 12@xmath94 m data overestimates the true sfr may be responsible ( see appendix  [ sec : ssfrmass2 ] ) .",
    "the validity of a mass - dependent correction for -sfrs must be tested with an independent sfr indicator less - sensitive to extinction .",
    "it is an important open question @xcite whether extinction is more physically related to a galaxy s stellar mass or sfr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently @xcite have presented compelling evidence from a large sdss sample that suggests stellar mass is the more fundamental , supporting our mass - dependent empirical correction for the effects of dust .",
    "in addition ,  luminosity is also sensitive to the effect of metallicity . as we discussed in paper 2",
    ", it is an open question how the effects of evolution in metallicty and dust may change our mass - dependent correction to the -sfr between that calibrated locally and that at higher redshift .",
    "it is possible that the evolutionary effects may in fact cancel out , since at z@xmath61 galactic metallicity is lower than locally ( so  luminosity increases for a given sfr ) , and dust extinction is likely higher @xcite ( so  luminosity decreases for a given sfr ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite recently proposed a fundamental relation between stellar mass , metallicity and sfr which is observed to remain constant , due to a conspiracy in the evolution of these parameters , up to z@xmath62.5 .",
    "we estimate the likely size of these effects below .    for low mass galaxies ,",
    "the situation is somewhat simplified as a ) the dust extinction is extremely low , as we have shown above ; b ) theoretical models for the dependence of  luminosity on sfr as a function of metallicity @xcite give good agreement with empirical calibrations @xcite . eqn . 15 from @xcite gives the correction to sfr which must be applied to  luminosity as a function of metallicity .",
    "taking the mass  metallicity ( m  z ) relations from @xcite for z@xmath60.1 and z@xmath60.7 ( their eqns .",
    "8 and 7 respectively ) , one can estimate the change in this theoretical correction between z@xmath60.7 and z@xmath60.1 . for a @xmath239.0 galaxy ( which is well sampled by the @xcite data at z@xmath60.7 ) , the evolution in this correction due to the evolution in metallicity is @xmath235% .",
    "this is not large enough to explain the observed upturn in the ssfr ",
    "mass relation for low mass galaxies . towards higher masses , the metallicity difference ( between z@xmath60.7 and z@xmath60.1 , eqns . 7 and 8 of @xcite ) becomes smaller , in fact crossing at @xmath23 10.30.7 data , and a polynomial fit to the z@xmath60.1 data .",
    "nevertheless the metallicity difference at these masses is still small . ] , and so differential evolution in the m  z relation can not explain the upturn at @xmath19 relative to @xmath610 galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the evolution in average dust extinction between z@xmath60.1 and z@xmath61 appears to be mild , even for the more massive galaxies considered here ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the expectation is that the empirical mass - dependent correction for -sfr should not change significantly by z@xmath61 . to properly test our empirical correction",
    "would require an analogue of our local test using balmer decrement corrected -sfrs at z@xmath61 , and such work is ongoing .",
    "another possible consideration is how star - forming galaxies are selected .",
    "it is now well - established that galaxies show a bimodal distribution in colour out to at least z@xmath61 @xcite , comprising a ` blue cloud ' dominated by star - forming galaxies , and a red - sequence dominated by passive galaxies with some minority of dust - reddened star - forming galaxies .",
    "a similar bimodality is also seen locally in the distribution of sfr or ssfr ( @xcite , mcgee et al . ,",
    "mnras submitted ) , such that galaxies exhibit a relatively tight star - forming sequence ( which may have scatter as low as 0.2 dex @xcite when plotted against stellar mass ) , and a broader population of galaxies with low ( s)sfrs exhibiting little or no star - formation .",
    "however a tail exists down from the star - forming sequence such that it is necessary to go @xmath931 dex lower in sfr to encompass 95% of galaxies ( fig .",
    "17 , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , however galaxies have their sfrs measured , be it emission lines or sed - fitting ( such as @xcite , mcgee et al . , in prep )",
    ", it is necessary to identify the star - forming sequence using either an overdensity selection in ( s)sfr  mass space ; or an approximate cut on ( s)sfr ; or , as we choose here , a colour cut to isolate the blue cloud .",
    "this rejects the tail of galaxies towards lower ssfrs and allows the bulk of the star - forming sequence to be isolated .",
    "this colour cut has the advantage when used with -sfrs that it rejects objects for which the source of the emission is likely not star - formation , and it simplifies the comparison with other works where people have applied a colour selection . throughout this work ,",
    "we have applied a colour cut to exclude red galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "this makes negligible difference to any of our results for dwarf galaxies since only one galaxy out of 199 in roles is red by this criterion , and the low mass end in the sdss data is unaffected by the colour cut ( c.f . left and right panels of fig .",

    "the z@xmath61 data move slightly toward lower ssfrs ( but still within the 1@xmath35 errors ) when red galaxies are included in the computation of the mean ( c.f .",
    "left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : ssfrmass ] ) , suggesting that liner activity and/or dust - reddened star - formation has little impact on the fors2 sample . at z@xmath60.1 , a significant lowering of the average ssfr in the sdss stripe82 data occurs when red galaxies are included in the mean .",
    "this is caused by the wide tail of low ssfr galaxies extending from the main star - forming sequence which can be seen as the difference between the two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : ssfrmass ] . excluding red - sequence galaxies better traces the peak of the contours ( i.e. the mode ) of the star - forming sequence and is more directly comparable to the selection made at z@xmath61 , and so we favour this approach .",

    "this is combined with an equally - deep comparison sample taken from stripe 82 of the sdss .",
    "we have , for the first time , measured the ssfr  mass relation and mass function of star - forming galaxies down to @xmath68.5 at z@xmath61 using spectroscopy .",
    "the strength of the roles dataset is that it offers a highly - complete spectroscopic sample for such low mass galaxies .",

    "these data are restricted to the region covered by mips 24@xmath94 m imaging and where the nir photometry was deeper than @xmath99 .",
    "stellar masses were fitted by @xcite .",

    "24@xmath94 m sfrs were computed by template - fitting @xcite ; and emission line sfrs were measured by @xcite .",
    "we have converted the assumptions used by the deep2 team in computing the purely -- sfrs to be the same as ours ( i.e. , they assume /@xmath00.69 and an average extinction at  of 1.30 mag independent of mass / magnitude ; we adopt a nominal /@xmath00.50 and 1 mag of extinction at , to which the empirical mass - dependent correction of @xcite can then be applied directly ) . however , we can not separate out the contribution of the two components in the @xmath2224@xmath94 m sfrs.24@xmath94 m sfrs , one would like to apply the empirical correction of @xcite ( which corrects for mass - dependent extinction _ and _ metallicity trends ) to the , and then divide this by the mass - dependent extinction ( eqn . 9 of @xcite ) to remove the dust correction , to which one may add the 24@xmath94 m flux which accounts directly for the extinguished component of star - formation . ]",
    "thus , the deep2 data consist of -sfrs using our mass - dependent correction ( where no 24@xmath94 m detection exists ) or an uncorrected @xmath2224@xmath94 m sfr ( where a significant 24@xmath94 m detection exists ) .",
    "the deep2 sfrs are only calculated for blue galaxies @xcite , since the emission line luminosity for red galaxies primarily comes from agn / liner activity rather than star - formation .",
    "all measurements of sfr and stellar mass are converted to our adopted bg03 imf ( see below ) .    as a check of the other two z@xmath61 datasets ,  sfrs from the zcosmos survey ( @xcite , kindly provided by c. maier ) are used .",

    "one of the main disadvantages of mips photometry is that the psf is relatively large ( 6 ) and so faint sources quickly become confused . to minimise this effect , we begin by just considering high mass sources , which will generally have higher sfrs and hence should be the brighter 24@xmath94 m sources . to achieve this ,",
    "objects are selected from just the fors2 sample . in order to attempt to quantify the impact of confusion ( which may still be problematic for these brighter sources ) , objects with significant irac band 1 flux ( 3.6@xmath94 m , hereafter , [ 3.6 ] )",
    "are selected from the fireworks catalogue .",
    "the [ 3.6 ] flux is often used as a prior when attempting to deblend the 24@xmath94 m images , since typically every 24@xmath94 m source is detected in [ 3.6 ] and the psf of the latter is much better than the former ( 1.6 ) .",
    "the [ 3.6 ] source list is cross - correlated with the 24@xmath94 m list , and objects with more than one match with 6  are flagged as potentially blended .",
    "the 6  radius means that two 24@xmath94 m sources separated by this amount will touch at their half - maxima .",
    "this should only be regarded as a crude estimate of confusion since the fireworks catalogue is @xmath21-band selected , and so a number of fainter [ 3.6 ] sources do not appear even in the deep @xmath21-band imaging , and hence some potential blends may not be identified .",
    "in addition , the presence of a second [ 3.6 ] source within the matching radius does not guarantee it will be a significant source of 24@xmath94 m flux , and so cases flagged as ` blended ' may in fact suffer no contamination from a neighbour .",
    "nevertheless , this method provides an approximate division between blended / unblended sources .        to understand any differences on our results from comparing our empirically - corrected -sfrs with @xmath2224@xmath94 m sfrs from @xcite ,",

    "however , even considering just the deep2 points using only  sfrs ( generally lower mass , @xmath610 ) shows a significantly higher sfr in the  data versus the cdfs data , and so the difference can not be attributed entirely to the inclusion of the 24@xmath94 m data .",
    "one main difference between the deep2  data and the other two datasets is that deep2 is not flux calibrated ( as the other samples are ) , but line strengths are calculated using equivalent widths and broad band photometry to calibrate the continuum .",
    "another difference is that deep2 is very biased towards blue - selection relative to the other surveys ( cdfs is @xmath89-band selected , zcosmos is @xmath111-band selected ) .",
    "although the @xmath21-band follow - up photometry helps with the mass selection of the aegis - deep2 data , the initial deep2 spectroscopy is still @xmath48-band selected ( which is close to rest - frame @xmath82 at z@xmath61 , and thus more closely resembles a sfr - seleted sample rather than mass - selected ) .",

    "in order to test for contamination of the  flux or 24@xmath94 m flux by agn in our sample , the technique of @xcite is used to examine the mir colours for the signature of an agn .

    "<S> mass functions are constructed for star - forming galaxies and found to evolve by only @xmath535% between z@xmath01 and z@xmath00.1 over the whole mass range . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution is such that the mass function decreases with increasing cosmic time , confirming that galaxies are leaving the star - forming sequence / blue cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the observational results are extended to z@xmath62 by adding two recent lyman break galaxy samples , and data at these three epochs ( z@xmath00.1 , 1 , 2 ) are compared with the galform semi - analytic model of galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> galform predicts an overall sfr density ( sfrd ) as a function of stellar mass in reasonable agreement with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> the star formation timescales inferred from 1/ssfr also give reasonable overall agreement , with the agreement becoming worse at the lowest and highest masses . </S>",
    "<S> the models do not reproduce the ssfr upturn seen in our data at low masses , where the effects of extinction and agn feedback should be minimal and the comparison should be most robust .    </S>",
