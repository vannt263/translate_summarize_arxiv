    "the search for the higgs boson is the main priority in high energy experiments and hints of its existence may have been already seen at lep@xcite at around @xmath3 gev .",
    "nevertheless , the sm can only be a low energy limit of a more fundamental theory because it can not explain a number of theoretical issues , one of which is the gauge hierarchy problem between the only two known scales in particle physics ",

    "@xcite proposed that using compactified dimensions of large size ( as large as mm ) can bring the planck scale down to tev range .",
    "randall and sundrum @xcite proposed a 5-dimensional space - time model with a nonfactorizable metric to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "the randall - sundrum model ( rsm ) has a four - dimensional massless scalar , the modulus or radion .",
    "the most important ingredients of the above model are the required size of the radion field such that it generates the desired weak scale from the scale @xmath4 ( @xmath5 planck scale ) and the stabilization of the radion field at this value .",
    "a stabilization mechanism was proposed by goldberger and wise @xcite . as a consequence of this stabilization ,",
    "the mass of the radion is of order of @xmath6 and the strength of coupling to the sm fields is of order of @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the detection of this radion will be the first signature of the rsm and the stabilization mechanism by goldberger and wise .",
    "higgs and radion can be produced in various types of accelerators .",
    "several papers have been published in order to study the possibility of detection of the higgs particle in @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 colliders @xcite .",

    "we explore the possibility of an intermediate - mass higgs boson or radion scalar be produced in peripheral heavy ion collisions through photon - photon interactions @xcite .",
    "the reason to choose photon - photon fusion in peripheral heavy ion collisions resides in the fact that the production mode is free of any problem caused by strong interactions of the initial state , which make these processes cleaner than pomeron - pomeron or pomeron - photon fusions . in the context of the sm",
    ", the higgs boson has been explored in detail in the literature @xcite , with the general conclusion that the chances of finding the sm higgs in the photon - photon case are marginal . on the other hand , a study of radion production in peripheral heavy ion collisions has not yet been made .",

    "in order to describe the interactions of the rsm radion with the sm particles , we follow the notation of ref .",
    "these interactions are model - independent and are governed by 4-dimensional general covariance , and thus given by the following lagrangian @xmath17 where @xmath18 is of order tev , and @xmath19 is the trace of sm energy - momentum tensor , which is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes higher order terms .",

    "( [ t ] ) . note that the couplings of the radion with fermions , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are similar to the couplings of the higgs to these particles , the only difference resides in the coupling constants where @xmath24 , the vev of the higgs field , is replaced by @xmath25 .",
    "the coupling of the radion to a pair of gluons ( photons ) is given by contributions from 1-loop diagrams with the top - quark ( top - quark and @xmath22 ) in the loop , similar to the higgs boson couplings to the same pair .",

    "60% per each quark @xmath89 @xcite , and finally an efficiency of reconstruction for @xmath90 or @xmath15 of 80% .",
    "taking all these efficiencies into account , the cross sections are evaluated with a total efficiency factor of 70(32)[80]% for the decay @xmath91 or @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "the results are presented in table [ acceptance_cut ] for a higgs and radion masses of 115 gev , with @xmath93 tev , in peripheral ar - ar and pb - pb collisions at lhc .",
    "results for ca - ca collisions at lhc can also be obtained , according to equation ( [ e3 ] ) , by simply multiplying the results for ar - ar collisions by the factor @xmath94 .    in order to improve the higgs and radion signal over sm background , i.e. , all other feynman diagrams that contribute to the process considered , we have studied several kinematical distributions of the final state particles .",
    "since the higgs and radion interactions occur mainly when these particles are produced on - shell , the most promising one is the invariant mass of the final particles .",
    "the behavior of the normalized invariant mass distribution of the final state particles is plotted in figure [ minv ] for the process @xmath95 with a higgs mass and a radion mass equal to 115 gev and @xmath96 tev .",
    "for instance , if we impose an additional cut of @xmath97 gev in the process @xmath95 , the value for the sm background cross section in peripheral ar - ar collisions is reduced from 6.927 pb to 0.8486 pb , while the value for the higgs ( radion ) cross section ( @xmath98 ) is almost unaffected , varying from 0.1038(1.923@xmath99 ) pb to 0.1038(1.919@xmath99 ) pb when the invariant mass cut is imposed .",
    "similar behavior is observed in the processes @xmath100 and @xmath2 , as can be seen in table [ refined_cut ] .",
    "therefore we collected final states @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 events whose invariant masses fall in bins of size of 30 gev around the higgs ( radion ) mass @xmath101 }   < m_{h(r ) } + 15\\text { gev } \\;\\ ; \\label{cut2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to evaluate our results .    considering the effective photon - photon luminosities given by figure [ gg_lumi ] and refs .",
    "@xcite , we note that the ar - ar(ca - ca ) luminosity is @xmath5250(2500 ) times greater than the pb - pb luminosity . on the other hand , table [ refined_cut ]",
    "shows that the pb - pb cross sections are @xmath530(20 ) times greater than the ar - ar(ca - ca ) cross sections .",
    "taking into account both luminosity and cross section behavior for each mode of the heavy ion lhc accelerator , one can realize that the total number of events in ar - ar(ca - ca ) collisions is @xmath58(125 ) times greater than in pb - pb collisions , which shows that pb - pb collisions is less indicated than ar - ar(ca - ca ) collisions for photon - photon fusion processes with a typical center of mass energy of @xmath102 gev .",
    "therefore , the pb - pb mode will not be considered form this point on in our analysis .",
    "another information that can be extracted from figure [ gg_lumi ] is the dependence between the effective photon - photon luminosity and the invariant mass of the initial @xmath12 pair , which indicates that a discovery of a sm higgs or a rsm radion production via photon - photon fusion is favored for low values for the invariant mass of the initial @xmath12 pair .",
    "similar conclusion can be obtained from figure [ mass ] , where the behavior of the cross sections of the processes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , for events whose invariant masses fall in bins of size of 30 gev around the mass @xmath4 used to impose the cut in equation ( [ cut2 ] ) , is presented for @xmath96 tev .",
    "higher values for the cross sections are obtained for masses @xmath4 lower than 200 gev . therefore , from this point on , we will only consider in our analysis a sm higgs and a rsm radion mass of 115 gev , as indicated by the latest hints from the lep higgs search @xcite experiment .",
    "another point considered in our analyses is the dependence between the cross sections for the radion contribution of the three processes and the ratio of the vev s of the radion ( @xmath25 ) and the higgs ( @xmath24 ) fields .",
    "figure [ lambda_v ] shows the behavior of the cross sections in the range @xmath103 .",
    "note that figures [ lambda_v ] ( a ) and ( b ) show that the sm higgs contribution is greater than the rsm radion contribution in the processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while figure [ lambda_v ] ( c ) shows that the rsm radion contribution is greater than the sm higgs contribution in the process @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , the process @xmath83 is the most sensitive for a radion search while the other two processes are most sensitive for a higgs search .    in order to identify a 95% c.l .",
    "signal of a sm higgs or a rsm radion production at the heavy ion mode of the lhc , let us consider the significance ( @xmath104 ) of a signal given by the equation @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the number of events , @xmath107 is the integrated luminosity of the accelerator , @xmath108 is cross section of the process considered .",
