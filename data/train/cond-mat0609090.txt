    "pure spin current represents a non - equilibrium distribution where free carriers , electrons or holes , with the spin `` up '' propagate mainly in one direction and equal number of spin - down carriers propagates in the opposite direction .",
    "this state is characterized by zero charge current because electric currents contributed by spin - up and spin - down quasiparticles cancel each other , but leads to accumulation of the opposite spins at the opposite edges of the sample .",
    "spin currents in semiconductors can be driven by an electric field acting on unpolarized free carriers ( the so - called spin hall effect ) .",
    "they can be induced as well by optical means under interband or intraband optical transitions in non - centrosymmetrical bulk and low - dimensional semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a pure spin current in semiconductor quantum wells ( qws ) under interband optical pumping with linearly polarized light is linked with the spin splitting of the energy spectrum , which is linear in the wave vector @xmath1 , and the spin - sensitive selection rules for the optical transitions .",
    "the effect is most easily conceivable for direct transitions between the heavy - hole valence subband @xmath2 and conduction subband @xmath3 in qws of the c@xmath4 point symmetry , e.g. , in ( 110)-grown qws . in such structures",
    "the spin component along the qw normal @xmath5 $ ] is coupled with the in - plane electron wave vector .",
    "this leads to @xmath6-linear spin - orbit splitting of the energy spectrum as sketched in fig .  1 , where the heavy hole subband @xmath2 is split into two spin branches @xmath7 .",
    "in the reduced - symmetry structures , the spin splitting of the conduction subband is usually smaller than that of the valence band and not shown for simplicity . due to",
    "the selection rules the allowed direct optical transitions from the valence subband @xmath2 to the conduction subband @xmath3 are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as illustrated in fig .  1 by vertical lines . in the presence of",
    "the spin splitting , electrons with the spins @xmath10 are photoexcited in the opposite points of the @xmath1 space which results in a flow of electrons within each spin branch .",
    "the corresponding fluxes @xmath11 and @xmath12 are of equal strengths but of opposite directions .",
    "thus , this non - equilibrium electron distribution is characterized by the nonzero spin current @xmath13 = @xmath14 but a vanishing charge current , @xmath15 .        in general ,",
    "the flux of electron spins can be characterized by a pseudo - tensor @xmath16 with the components @xmath17 describing the flow in the @xmath18 direction of spins oriented along @xmath19 , with @xmath19 and @xmath18 being the cartesian coordinates .",
    "the non - zero components of the photo - induced spin current are determined by the light polarization and the explicit form of spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the latter is governed by the qw symmetry and can be varied . in ( 110)-grown qws",
    "the absorption of unpolarized light leads to a flow along @xmath20 $ ] of spins oriented along @xmath21 .",
    "this component can be estimated as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant describing the @xmath24-linear spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath2 subband , @xmath25 is the relaxation time of the spin current , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the electron and hole effective masses in the qw plane , respectively , @xmath28 is the light absorbance , and @xmath29 is the light intensity .",
    "another contribution to spin photocurrents may come from @xmath24-linear terms in the matrix elements of the interband optical transitions .",
    "taking into account @xmath30 admixture of the remote condution band @xmath31 to the valence - band and conduction - band states @xmath32 and @xmath33 , one derives the interband matrix elements of the velocity operator for bulk zinc - blende - lattice semiconductors  @xcite @xmath34 \\:,\\\\",

    "in contrast to the low - symmetry qws considered above , in ( 001)-qws the linear - in-*k * terms in the matrix elements of optical transitions under normal incidence vanish , and the spin photocurrents are entirely related to the spin - orbit splitting of the free - carrier subbands .",
