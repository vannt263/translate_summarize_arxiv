    "in heavy - ion , atomic and molecular collisions , an elastic differential cross section , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the scattering angle , is often characterized by a complicated interference pattern .",
    "this complicated structure makes it difficult to understand the physical phenomena involved in the scattering process , as well as the links between @xmath6 and the properties of the model that describes the phenomenon .    in some cases",
    ", semiclassical methods @xcite explain the scattering pattern as the interference between simpler , and slowly varying , subamplitudes .",
    "if we ignore the complication that , in some angular regions , uniform asymptotic techniques are necessary , then the semiclassical subamplitudes arise mathematically from saddle points or poles , which account physically for contributions from reflected , refracted or generalized diffracted semiclassical trajectories @xcite .",
    "the subamplitudes can be conveniently grouped into two types : those arising from semiclassical trajectories which initially move in the same half plane as the detector ( n or nearside trajectories ) and those from the opposite half plane ( f or farside trajectories ) .",
    "semiclassical methods are not always simple to apply and sometimes they have a limited range of applicability .",
    "their limitations are determined by the range of validity of the ( presently known ) asymptotic techniques that are used to approximate the original quantum mechanical problem .    in order to overcome these difficulties , it is common practice to apply to the elastic scattering amplitude , @xmath8 , a nf method that was proposed by fuller@xcite more than 25 years ago .",
    "the fuller nf method has the merit of being simple and , although inspired by the semiclassical theories , it uses only scattering matrix elements @xmath9 calculated ( or directly parametrized ) by exact quantum mechanics .",
    "the nf subamplitudes are obtained by exact summation of nf partial wave series ( pws ) , thereby bypassing problems associated with the applicability and validity of semiclassical techniques , e.g. using approximate @xmath9 , replacing the pws by integrals , using stationary phase integration , etc .",
    "the fuller method is based on a splitting of the legendre polynomials , @xmath10 , in the pws of @xmath8 , into traveling angular wave components , with the traveling angular waves consistent with detailed semiclassical analyses of scattering from impenetrable and transparent spheres @xcite .",
    "the fuller method was @xcite and continues to be widely used ; indeed the isi web of science reports about 140 citations since 1981 to fuller s seminal work ( for more recent examples see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the success of the method depends , apart from its simplicity , on its remarkable capability of physically explaining complicated interference patterns in cross sections as arising from the interference between nf subamplitudes having simple properties .",
    "in particular , the nf cross sections are often less structured and more slowly varying with @xmath7 than is the full cross section .",
    "even though no semiclassical technique has been used , these nf subamplitudes can often be given a physical interpretation ( in analogy with results from semiclassical methods ) as contributions from simple scattering mechanisms , which then allows a good understanding of the angular scattering .",
    "in the light of these unquestionable successes , it is desirable to extend the validity of the fuller approach to cases where the original fuller method is not ( physically ) satisfactory , for example , it may produce oscillatory and rapidly varying nf cross sections , when the full cross section is monotonic and slowly varying with @xmath7 .",
    "examples of these shortcomings have been known for a long time .",
    "one classic example is pure coulomb scattering . for repulsive coulomb potentials only a n contribution is expected semiclassically ( @xcite , p. 56 ) , whereas the fuller nf method yields also a f contribution @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the nf cross sections are less simple than the full one . in this case , the unsatisfactorily effects are , however , confined to a restricted backward angular region ( @xcite , p. 1564 ) .",
    "another more striking example is observed in the scattering by a uniformly charged sphere ( @xcite , p. 154",
    "26 ) . in this case",
    ", the ratio of the full cross section to the rutherford one decreases monotonically into the shadow of the coulomb rainbow .",
    "in contrast , the n ratio closely follows the full ratio up to @xmath11 when it becomes approximately constant ( i.e. independent of @xmath7 ) , being approximately equal to the f ratio .",
    "a similar effect is also observed in the angular distributions for a strong absorption model ( sam ) with a two parameter ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) symmetric @xmath14 matrix element and fermi - like form factors @xcite .",
    "for a fixed value of the cut - off parameter @xmath12 and for a sufficiently large value of the diffuseness parameter @xmath13 , the fuller nf cross sections show an almost exponential decline up to a certain @xmath7 ( which decreases with increasing @xmath13 ) . at larger angles ,",
    "the nf cross sections are greater then the full cross section , which continues its oscillatory exponential decline .",
    "similar striking effects appear at high energies and for large scattering angles in the nf cross sections of @xmath3 particles and light heavy - ions scattered by nuclei using optical potentials .",
    "less striking , but still disturbing , effects are also observed , at lower energies , in some n cross sections for the optical potentials used to fit recent data of light heavy - ion scattering @xcite .",
    "typical n cross sections rapidly decrease from @xmath15 and from @xmath16 .",
    "the two branches meet in the crossing region where an interference pattern appears , with strong oscillations over an extended range of angles .    in this paper , we show how some of these shortcomings can be removed using a new nf method @xcite , based on an _ improved modified resummation _ of the pws .",
    "the new method is a development of the hatchell @xcite idea of incorporating the yennie , ravenhall and wilson ( yrw ) @xcite resummation technique into the nf formalism .",
    "the limitations of the nf hatchell resummation technique have been discussed @xcite and a _ modified _ nf yrw resummation procedure , depending on two parameters @xmath3 and @xmath17 , was proposed @xcite to bypass the difficulties with the original nf yrw approach .",
    "the possibility of further _ improving _ the modified yrw resummation procedure , using different resummation parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 , together with a rule to fix the value of these parameters @xcite , is discussed in the present work .    for all three nf methods , fuller , hatchell and ours , the starting point is the quantum mechanical pws for the full scattering amplitude @xmath8 , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the wavenumber , @xmath22 is the legendre polynomial of degree @xmath23 and @xmath24 is given in terms of the scattering matrix element @xmath9 by : @xmath25 in the following , we will write @xmath26 . for future convenience , we recall that the pws ( [ pardev ] ) , considered as a distribution , converges to its exact value for @xmath27 , upon dropping the 1 in the term @xmath28 on the r.h.s of ( [ paramp ] ) .",
    "the omitted amplitude is proportional to the dirac delta function @xmath29 ( e.g. see @xcite , p. 52 ) .",
    "we also recall that the pws ( [ pardev ] ) , considered as a distribution , is convergent if @xmath9 is asymptotically coulombic @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we briefly outline the original fuller nf method , and show that unsatisfactorily results are obtained for seven collision systems , which are different from those considered in @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we discuss a modification of the fuller nf technique proposed in refs . @xcite and present an improved modified method .",
    "our new method is very effective in cleaning unphysical contributions from nf cross sections for the seven examples where the usual fuller technique gives usatisfactorily results .",
    "our conclusions are in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "the fuller nf decomposition is realized by splitting in ( [ pardev ] ) @xmath30 , considered as a standing angular wave , into traveling angular wave components @xmath31 where ( for @xmath32 ) @xmath33,\\ ] ] with @xmath34 the legendre function of the second kind of degree @xmath35 .",

    "the splitting of @xmath46 into the sum of @xmath47 , or the related splitting obtained from the asymptotic expansions of these functions @xcite , plays a crucial role in deriving the semiclassical subamplitudes .",
    "in particular , the nf semiclassical subamplitudes arise from terms originally containing @xmath47 , or their asymptotic expansions ( [ asyqpm ] ) .",
    "these facts raise the hope that the direct calculation of the @xmath48 from their pws representation in ( [ pardevmp ] ) will separate the nf contributions to @xmath36 , thereby avoiding problems connected with the applicability or validity of the semiclassical theory .    in order to make this hope mathematically rigorous",
    ", one should prove that it is possible to perform on the pws , written in terms of the @xmath49 , the same manipulations that are used in deriving the complete semiclassical decomposition of @xmath8 .",
    "these manipulations are essentially path deformations in @xmath50 of the integrals into which ( [ pardev ] ) can be transformed , using either the poisson sum formula ( @xcite , p. 45 )",
    "or the watson transformation ( @xcite , p. 49 ) .",
    "the consequences of these path deformations depend on the properties of the terms in the pws when they are continued to real or complex values of @xmath51 from the initial physical half integer @xmath50 values .",
    "the splitting of @xmath52 into the @xmath53 modifies these properties and can cause the appearance of unphysical contributions in the @xmath48 , which cancel out in @xmath8 ( these contributions are not expected to be present in the semiclassical subamplitudes ) .    in spite of these possible limitations , extensive experience with the fuller nf method",
    "has demonstrated that the method is usually reliable , in the sense that it often decomposes @xmath8 into simpler nf subamplitudes , apparently free from unphysical contributions arising from the above mathematical difficulties .",
    "however for a few examples , some of which were mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] , the fuller nf subamplitudes can be directly compared with the corresponding exact analytical , or semiclassical , results and disagreements are observed .",
    "fortunately , the fuller nf subamplitudes contain information that allows one to recognize the unphysical nature of the undesired contributions .",
    "suppose @xmath54 , or @xmath55 , contains a single semiclassical contribution from a stationary phase point at @xmath56 .",
    "then the derivative with respect to @xmath7 of the phase of @xmath54 , or @xmath55 , is equal to @xmath56 , or @xmath57 , respectively ( @xcite , p. 57 ) .",
    "following fuller we will call this derivative the _ local angular momentum _ ( lam ) for the f ( or n ) subamplitude ; it depends on @xmath7 . usually , only for a generalized diffracted trajectory , arising from a simple pole ,",
    "is the lam expected to be constant , being equal to the angular momentum of the incoming particle responsible for the diffraction .    in the semiclassical regime",
    ", this constant value is expected to be large .",
    "because of this , if we observe that , in a certain @xmath7 range , lam @xmath58 0 , this can be considered a warning for the unphysical nature of the n or f subamplitudes in that range of @xmath7 .",
    "this occurs for the lam of the fuller coulomb f subamplitude , and for the nf subamplitudes of the sam in the angular region where the nf cross sections contain unphysical contributions @xcite . in both cases , this decoupling of @xmath7 from lam , together with the fact that the full cross section is simpler then the nf ones , suggests the unphysical nature of the nf subamplitudes .",
    "we show below for seven collision systems , different from those considered in @xcite , how unphysical nf contributions manifest themselves .",
    "the seven collision systems are ; ( a ) a simple sam model , ( b ) @xmath0o + @xmath0o at @xmath2 = 145 mev , using the ws2 optical potential of ref .",
    "@xcite , and ( c ) more briefly , @xmath0o + @xmath0o at @xmath2 = 480 , 704 , 1120 mev , and @xmath3 + @xmath4c , @xmath3 + @xmath5ca , both at @xmath2 = 1370 mev .",
    "the first example is a simple sam in which the @xmath9 is directly parametrized by @xmath59 with @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ,    the sam ( with modifications for the coulomb interaction , and in a slightly different form from ( [ sam ] ) ) was widely used in early studies of heavy - ion elastic scattering @xcite . at the present time , the sam is not so popular , using either simple forms such as ( [ sam ] ) or more sophisticated functions .",
    "it has been found that the characteristics of heavy - ion angular distributions , measured over wide angular ranges , are not accounted for by the simpler sam models ; instead the angular scattering is more easily described using optical potentials , rather then attempting complicated extensions of the sam .    in spite of this",
    ", the sam in its simple form ( [ sam ] ) continues to be of interest , since it allows important tests of nf decompositions @xcite .",
    "this is because the pws for the sam ( [ sam ] ) can be evaluated easily by saddle point techniques @xcite , or more simply , using the watson transformation and elementary complex integration .",
    "both methods allow a simple , mathematically correct , identification of the nf subamplitudes . for @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65",

    "@xcite , eq .",

    "the nf cross sections , multiplied by @xmath67 are equal and have an exponential slope , whereas the phase derivatives of the nf subamplitudes are expected to be equal to @xmath68 , respectively .",

    "furthermore , because the @xmath9 are real , @xmath8 has a constant phase ( and its phase derivative is of no interest ) , while the @xmath72 have identical moduli but opposite phases .",
    "thus we need only show the n ( or f ) lam and similarly for the cross sections . in fig .",
    "1 , the n and f quantities are shown by thick continuous and dashed curves , respectively .    in a systematic notation explained in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , the results obtained from the fuller nf method , which substitutes ( [ euldec ] ) into ( [ pardev ] ) , are indicated by @xmath73 . the thin curve , in the lower panel of fig .",

    "figure 1 shows that , for @xmath73 , unphysical contributions dominate the f (= n ) cross section over most of the angular range , i.e. for @xmath74 . in particular , the f curve is completely different from the expected exponential decrease . also the f (= @xmath75n ) lam @xmath76 for @xmath74 . at forward angles , oscillations in the f lam curve",
    "indicate that another f subamplitude is present , which interferes with the unphysical one .",
    "this behavior does not support the conjecture that the f lam of this other subamplitude has the expected value , @xmath77 .    by comparing the lower panel of fig .",

    "the explanation for this observation is straightforward .",
    "the amplitude obtained on dropping @xmath9 from the term @xmath28 in ( [ paramp ] ) is @xmath80 . applying to @xmath81 the same procedure used by fuller to derive the nf coulomb subamplitudes ( ref .",

    "the corresponding nf cross sections , downward shifted by one vertical unit , are shown in fig . 1 by the thin dotted curve and labelled nf@xmath83 .",
    "this curve shows that the major part of the unphysical contribution , when it dominates the fuller f subamplitude , is due to @xmath84 and does not depend on the properties of @xmath9 .",
    "a more satisfactory fuller nf result is obtained by dropping @xmath85 from the term @xmath86 in ( [ paramp ] ) , and then considering the pws thus obtained as a distribution . to ensure convergence of the resulting nf subamplitudes",
    ", a yrw resummation is performed on them .",
    "this is explained in more detail in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , and in a systematic notation developed there , is denoted @xmath87 .",
    "figure 1 shows that the @xmath87 results are rather good at forward angles , @xmath88 .",
    "apart from a small region around @xmath89 , where the condition @xmath65 is not satisfied , the n (= @xmath75f ) lam agrees closely with the expected value of @xmath90 up to @xmath91 , and the n (= f ) cross section curve follows the expected exponential decrease . for @xmath92 ,",
    "the n cross section is still dominated by an unphysical contribution . at intermediate angles , @xmath93",
    ", interference oscillations appear both in the n cross section and in the n lam curve .",
    "it is interesting to note that the nf lams are more sensitive to interference effects in fig . 1 than are the nf cross sections .",
    "also , in the interference region , one can not attach the meaning of a _ local angular momentum _ to the subamplitude phase derivative . in our case , in this interference region , the n lam curve oscillates around the expected semiclassical value of @xmath90 in the region , @xmath94 , where the true semiclassical component dominates the n subamplitude , and around the unphysical value of 0 at larger angles .",
    "figure 2 shows our results for the phenomenological ( ws2 ) optical potential used to fit @xcite the @xmath0o + @xmath0o elastic cross section at @xmath96 mev . the usual fuller nf method has been applied that employs an analytic formula for the nf subamplitudes of the coulomb scattering amplitude @xcite .",

    "in the upper panel we display lam/@xmath21 , which we call the _ local impact parameter _",
    "( lip ) , and in the lower panel a log plot of @xmath97 .",
    "the thin continuous lines show the ( unsymmetrized ) cross section and lip for the full amplitude . for @xmath98 , and at backward angles ,",
    "the full cross section is characterized by oscillations having approximately the same period . in the intermediate angular range ,",
    "@xmath99 , there are oscillations of longer period , which increases as @xmath7 increases . these properties , which are typical of light heavy - ion scattering , are much more complicated than those for the simple sam cross sections , and indicate the presence of several interfering subamplitudes .    the oscillations in the lip curve for the full amplitude",
    "qualitatively follow those in the full cross section .",
    "in addition , the change in sign of the full lip for @xmath98 indicates a crossover between one n subamplitude , dominant at smaller angles ( where the full lip oscillates around negative values ) , with a f subamplitude that is dominant at larger angles ( where the full lip oscillates around positive values ) .",
    "the oscillations of longer period in the intermediate angular range for the full cross section correspond to an oscillating positive lip .",
    "this indicates there is an interference between two f subamplitudes with a crossover near the deep minimum at @xmath91 .",
    "the oscillations at backward angles in the full cross section indicate an interference of one of these f subamplitudes with its continuation to the opposite side of the target ( n ) .",
    "the results of the fuller nf method ( thick curves , continuous for n and dashed for f quantities ) in fig .",
    "2 confirm this interpretation .",
    "the n cross section crosses the f one at @xmath98 ; the f cross section oscillates in the intermediate angular range before decreasing , almost monotonically , towards backward angles , where it meets the n cross section . for @xmath100 , the behavior of the n cross section",
    "is characterized by rather complicated oscillations .",
    "it is difficult to imagine that these oscillations arise only from interference between a n subamplitude , which is dominant at forward angles , with a n subamplitude dominant at backward angles .",
    "the thin dotted lines in fig . 2 show interpolations ( linear fits ) of the average behavior of the n cross section in the ranges @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in the crossing region of the dotted lines ,",
    "the n cross section is about two orders of magnitude larger then the crossing value .",
    "the contribution from an additional n subamplitude is apparently necessary to explain this behavior of the n cross section .",
    "the shape of the n lip curve supports this conjecture .",
    "the n lip curve is oscillatory , with increasing oscillation amplitude , up to @xmath103 , where the deep minimum corresponds to a crossover between two interfering n subamplitudes . for @xmath104 ,",
    "the n lip curve is oscillatory around 0 , which suggests an unphysical origin for the n subamplitude dominant in this angular range . at @xmath105 , where there is a narrow maximum in the n lip curve , the unphysical n subamplitude crosses a different n subamplitude , that becomes dominant at backward angles .",
    "oscillations , similar to those observed at backward angles in the n lip curve , are present at backward angles in the f lip curve .",
    "the corresponding oscillations in the f cross section are barely visible with the scale used in the lower panel of fig .",
    "they can , however , be observed in the inset , where the thin rectangular area is plotted with a vertical scale magnified by a factor of 3 .    in summary",
    "our detailed analysis of the nf lip and nf cross sections indicates the presence of an unphysical contribution , which makes the properties of these quantities unneccessarily complicated .      in this section",
    "we briefly discuss five additional examples where the nf optical potential cross sections are dominated by unphysical contributions over wide angular ranges .",

    "in the preceding section , we have discussed examples where the fuller nf method resulted in unphysical contributions .",
    "we also clearly demonstrated that the fuller method has the capability to identify the unphysical contributions through anomalous behavior in the nf lam , or lip .",
    "this capability helps us to avoid misleading interpretations of the full and nf cross sections obtained from the fuller nf method .",
    "however the problem of finding more satisfactory nf methods without unphysical contributions remains open .",
    "a possible solution to this problem was proposed by hatchell @xcite , who used a modified nf method .",
    "the modifications consisted of , first , in writing @xmath8 in the resummed form ( @xmath110 ) @xmath111 @xmath112 , and , second , in using a different splitting in the resummed pws ( [ jendev ] ) for the legendre polynomials into traveling waves .",

    "the success of using ( [ jendev ] ) before applying the nf splitting ( [ euldec ] ) depends upon the properties of the resummed coefficients @xmath118 . for the sam at low @xmath23 values , the @xmath118",
    "rapidly decrease in magnitude @xcite with increasing @xmath113 . as a result ,",
    "the low @xmath23 values , where the splitting into running angular waves is physically less reasonable , give a smaller contribution to the resummed pws .",
    "however , in some cases , this resummation technique acts in the opposite direction , by enhancing the undesired unphysical contributions to the nf resummed subamplitudes .",
    "we have found that this happens , for example , for pure coulomb scattering , for scattering by an impenetrable sphere , and for the sam ( see @xcite ) when the cross section is calculated at an angle @xmath143 , using the identity @xmath144=(-1)^l",
    "p_l(\\cos \\theta)$ ] .",
    "one possible solution to the intriguing puzzle discussed in section [ sec:30a ] is to regard ( [ jenide ] ) as a particular case of the modified resummation identity @xcite @xmath145 with @xmath146 and @xmath147 for @xmath148 , apart a renormalization factor , the r.h.s . of ( [ jenidegen ] )",
    "depends only on the ratio @xmath149 .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , we can assume @xmath150 for all @xmath151 . by iterating ( [ jenidegen ] ) @xmath113 times",
    ", we can write @xmath8 in the modified resummed form ( @xmath152 ) @xmath153 @xmath154 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the extended modified resummed form for the pws ( [ pwse ] ) is given by ( @xmath32 and @xmath155 ) @xmath156 the identity ( [ jendevgen ] ) is the key result for our improved nf method .",
    "the yrw resummation formula ( [ jendev ] ) is obtained when @xmath157 .",
    "the resummed form ( [ jendevgen ] ) with @xmath158 is a particular case of a more general one @xcite , which uses a basis set of reduced rotation matrix elements ; this gives the amplitude for more general scattering processes than those described by ( [ pardev ] ) .",
    "for these general pws , a fuller - like nf decomposition can be introduced @xcite which allows the scattering amplitude to be separated into nf subamplitudes . in some cases ,",
    "the nf cross sections contained unexpected ( unphysical ) oscillations @xcite , which are enhanced if the generalization of ( [ jendev ] ) is used , but which disappear for an appropriate choice of the @xmath17-parameter in the generalization of ( [ jendevgen ] ) .",
    "the considerable successes achieved by the original fuller nf method suggest that the modified resummed form ( [ jendevgen ] ) be used to diminuish unphysical contaminations to the nf subamplitudes when they are present . to do this , we must give a practical rule to fix the values of the @xmath159 parameters .",
    "@xcite , it was proposed to select the value of @xmath158 so that @xmath160 _ approximately mimics the shape of the angular distribution_. the shape of the cross section can however be very different from that given by @xmath160 .",
    "it is therefore desirable to test a different recipe , based on a simple rule .",
    "the quantitative recipe proposed here is inspired by the observation that the modified resummation procedures produce a more physical nf understanding by reducing the contribution from the low @xmath23 values in the resummed pws .",
    "this suggests that we select the @xmath161 in @xmath113 repeated applications of ( [ jenidegen ] ) , so as to eliminate as many low @xmath23 terms as possible from the resummed pws in ( [ jendevgen ] ) .",
    "the transformation from @xmath162 to @xmath163 is linear tridiagonal , with coefficients linear in @xmath164 , which means that a resummation of order @xmath113 allows one to equate to zero the leading @xmath113 coefficients @xmath118 , with @xmath165 , by solving a system of @xmath113 equations of degree @xmath113 in the parameters @xmath166 .",
    "we will call the resummation defined in this way an _ improved resummation of order @xmath113_. it is straightforward to show that the improved resummation of order @xmath167 is obtained by choosing @xmath168",
    "while the improved resummation of order @xmath169 is given by @xmath170 with @xmath171 and @xmath172 solutions of the linear equations @xmath173 higher order improved resummations require the solution of more complicated systems of equations .",
    "note that the improved resummation of order @xmath167 is , obviously , not defined if @xmath174 .",
    "similarly the resummation of order @xmath169 is not defined for an ( accidentally ) zero value of the determinant of the linear equations ( [ sys ] ) .",
    "analogous limitations are expected to hold for higher order resummations .",
    "however , these pathological situations were never observed in our calculations . in all the cases",
    "we have analyzed using @xmath175 , we find that the improved resummations considerably reduce the width of the angular regions in which the fuller nf cross sections exhibit unphysical behavior . in these analyses ,",
    "we have used @xmath9 from simple parametrizations , as well as from some of the optical potentials currently employed to describe light heavy - ion scattering . note that , as for the yrw resummed form ( [ jendev ] ) , no physical information is lost on using our improved resummed form ( [ jendevgen ] ) , and the full @xmath8 does not depend in any way on the resummation order used .",
    "this might seem surprising , because our method omits the contribution from low values of @xmath23 .",
    "for example , for the improved resummation of order @xmath176 , the _ resummed _ term @xmath177 is set to zero in the _ resummed _ pws , but the information on the _ physical _ value of @xmath178 is contained in the _ resummed _ term @xmath179 and in the resummation parameter @xmath180 , and similarily for higher order resummations .",
    "the improved resummation method only modifies the nf ( resummed ) subamplitudes , not their sum @xmath8 , as it tries to eliminate unphysical contributions that have their origin in the nf splitting of the @xmath141 into running waves @xmath181 .",
    "the physical meaning of the nf splitting ( [ euldec ] ) is based on the asymptotic properties of @xmath30 and @xmath182 , see ( [ asyqpm ] ) .",
    "the nf splitting ( [ euldec ] ) is not expected to be physically meaningful for low @xmath23 values .",
    "for example , for @xmath183 , ( [ euldec ] ) states that @xmath184 is the sum of @xmath185.\\ ] ] this decomposition of unity is undoubtly mathematically exact , but it is difficult to think that it can be physically meaningful .",
    "it is contributions of this type that the improved resummation omits from the resummed pws , after having moved to higher values of @xmath23 in the resummed pws , the physical information contained in the original @xmath9 .",
    "it is also interesting to understand the reasons for the successes and failures of the hatchell method for the sam @xcite based on the use of the yrw resummed form ( [ jendev ] ) for @xmath8 and the fuller nf splitting ( [ euldec ] ) . in those cases where the hatchell method is successfull",
    ", we find for low @xmath23 values , @xmath186 , and the @xmath118 are made small in magnitude with the choice @xmath187 . in those cases where the hatchell method fails",
    ", it happens that , for low @xmath23 values , @xmath188 , and the choice @xmath189 makes the @xmath118 small in magnitude .",
    "our improved method automatically chooses appropriate values for the resummation parameters using the exact values of @xmath9 .",
    "finally , we summarize the procedure used by our new improved resummation method . the calculations are performed applying : _ first _ , an improved resummation of order @xmath190 , with @xmath191 meaning no resummation , _ second _ , the fuller nf splitting ( [ euldec ] ) , and _ third _ an extended yrw resummation ( [ jendeve ] ) of the nf ( resummed ) subamplitudes . this latter yrw resummation is necessary to ensure the convergence of the final nf pws .",
    "this final resummation can , however , be replaced with any other procedure that provides convergence of the final nf pws .",
    "the results obtained from these three steps will be indicated by the notation @xmath192 .",
    "the notation @xmath193 is used in fig . 1 . also , we use @xmath73 to indicate the original fuller method for the sam case : no resummation and no final yrw resummation , because , in this case , the presence of the 1 in the term @xmath28 ensures rapid convergence of the pws .      our results obtained after applying the @xmath194 procedures to the sam of sec .",
    "[ sec:21 ] are shown in fig .",
    "the effectiveness of the improved resummation procedure is impressive , both for the nf cross sections and for the nf lam curves .",
    "using the @xmath195 method ( for which @xmath196 ) , the f (= @xmath75n ) lam and the f (= n ) cross section are in agreement with the expected results up to @xmath197 . for @xmath198 ( which has @xmath199 ) , the agreement covers almost the whole angular range .",
    "the small irregular oscillations appearing at large @xmath7 for the n lam curve , when @xmath198 , may arise from precision limitations ( 64 bit floating point representation ) in the calculations , or from residual unphysical contributions not completely removed by our improved method .",
    "if instead we apply the yrw resummation procedure , we find that it gives worse results compared to our @xmath200 methods , although better results than the fuller @xmath193 method .",
    "this is because the yrw choice of @xmath201 is not too far from our improved estimate of these parameters .",
    "note that , using our improved procedure , the value of the sam cut - off parameter , @xmath202 , is correctly identified in the plots of the lam . also , no shift of the lam occurs on changing the resummation order .",
    "we recall that resummation does not change or translate in any way the physical properties @xmath9 ; nor does it alter the physical content of @xmath8 .",
    "it only changes the coefficients @xmath203 in the resummed pws ( [ jendevgen ] ) .",
    "note that the @xmath203 have a different meaning from the partial wave amplitudes @xmath120 , and the summation index of the resummed pws ( [ jendevgen ] ) should not be identified as the orbital angular momentum quantum number .",
    "this is because the resummation extracts the factor @xmath204 from the legendre polynomial pws .",
    "figure 5 shows our results for the ws2 optical potential of sec .",
    "[ sec:22 ] using the @xmath195 method ( for which @xmath205 ) .",
    "the oscillations of the fuller n curves around @xmath206 are removed , and both the @xmath195 n cross section and the n lip curve are considerably simpler than those from the fuller method .",
    "the f curves are essentially the same as those in fig .",
    "2 , although the @xmath195 method has suppressed the oscillations in the f cross section at backward angles ( compare the insets in the lower panels of figs . 2 and 5 ) , as well as the oscillations in the f lip curve in the same angular range .",
    "this demonstrates that the @xmath195 method is more effective than the usual fuller one in decomposing @xmath8 into slowly varying nf subamplitudes .",
    "it also shows that some oscillations in the fuller nf cross sections in fig .",
    "2 are artifacts , without any physical meaning , introduced by the properties of the nf technique used .",
    "we have also applied the improved resummation method @xmath198 .",
    "the results are practically the same as those for @xmath195 and are not shown .",
    "the cleaning by the @xmath195 procedure in fig .",
    "5 of the original fuller nf subamplitudes ( fig .",
    "2 ) is impressive and allows a better identification , in the f cross section and f lip of the dominance , for @xmath207 , of the contributions from classical - like trajectories refracted from the internal part of the nuclear interaction . in fig .",
    "5 , this interpretation is demonstrated by the overall agreement , for @xmath207 , between the f curves and the classical mechanical results ( thin curve , labelled 1 ) corresponding to impact parameters smaller than the classical orbiting one .    for the ws2 potential the collision energy is , in fact , slightly below the critical energy at which orbiting disappears for the classical deflection function ( when it is transformed into a nuclear rainbow minimum ) . because of this , the dependence of the impact parameter @xmath208 on @xmath7 is that of an infinitly many - valued function ( @xcite , p. 127 - 129 ) .",
    "four of these branches , corresponding to the deflection function being larger than @xmath209 , are plotted for the lip in the upper panel of fig .",
    "5 ( shown by thin curves ) and labelled from 1 to 4 for increasing values of @xmath208 . the lip is assumed to be equal to @xmath208 for the f branches ( thin dashed curves , with labels 1 and 4 ) and to @xmath210 in the n case ( thin continuous curves , 2 and 3 ) . in the lower panel ,",
    "the thin curves , with the same labels , show the contributions to the classical cross section from these branches , in which we have included , in the usual simple way ( @xcite , p. 49 ) , the absorptive effects of the imaginary part of the optical potential .    the agreement between the quantum @xmath195 f curves and the classical curve labelled 1 is overall good for @xmath207 , and is impressive for @xmath92 .",
    "this shows that the @xmath195 f subamplitude , calculated by an exact quantum method , is dominated for @xmath207 by a classical contribution corresponding to trajectories with small impact parameters , @xmath211 fm , which are refracted by the nuclear interaction . the contribution from f branch 1 continues at @xmath16 into the contribution from n branch 2 .",
    "however , as @xmath7 decreases from @xmath16 , there is an increasing disagreement with the average quantum n contribution .",
    "evidently , for impact parameters that approach the orbiting one ( @xmath212 fm ) , diffractive effects start to become significant .",
    "finally , we note that there is a large disagreement between the classical f curve 4 and the average behavior of the quantum f cross section at forward angles .",
    "this suggests that the other f subamplitude responsible for the interference pattern in the f quantum cross section can not be considered a classical - like refractive contribution .      in fig .",
    "6 , we show the n ( upper panel ) and f ( lower panel ) cross sections calculated using the improved nf method , @xmath213 , for the optical potentials considered in sec .",
    "[ sec:23 ] .",
    "in contrast to fig .",
    "3 , no normalization factors are used in fig .",
    "comparison of fig . 6 with fig .",
    "3 shows that the @xmath213 nf resummation method has removed the unphysical contributions that dominate the fuller nf cross sections over most of the angular range .    for these cases , @xmath214 , and @xmath215 , in descending order for the collision systems listed in the legend of the upper panel of fig .",
    "6 . in all cases , @xmath216 , which is a consequence of the fact that , for these five collision systems , at low @xmath23 values we have @xmath186 .",
    "the result @xmath216 also explains why the unphysical contributions in the fuller nf cross sections of fig .",
    "3 have very similar shapes . indeed for @xmath217 , the angular dependence of the unphysical cross sections is @xmath218 , which is the same as the rutherford cross section .",
    "this implies that on making the ( usual ) plot of the ratio of the cross sections to the rutherford one , the unphysical contributions will appear independent of @xmath7 , i.e. a constant .",
    "figure 6 clearly shows that the @xmath213 method has cleaned the fuller nf cross sections of unphysical contributions .",
    "the @xmath213 and fuller nf cross sections agree closely at forward angles , with the @xmath213 curves providing the correct continuation of the fuller nf curves to larger angles , where the unphysical fuller nf contributions become dominant over the @xmath213 results .",
    "in addition , the @xmath213 procedure clearly identifies the oscillatory pattern of the @xmath0o + @xmath0o full cross sections at @xmath219 480 mev and 704 mev as an interference between the nf resummed subamplitudes .    as a final curiosity",
    ", we note that a suspect behavior appears in the @xmath213 nf cross sections for @xmath220c at @xmath221 .",
    "we find that the corresponding @xmath213 nf lip are @xmath76 for @xmath100 .",
    "however , the lip for the full amplitude is also @xmath76 for @xmath100 , indicating that the full cross section is dominated by contributions from low partial waves in this angular region .",
    "we have repeated the calculations , substituting the ws form factors used in @xcite , with symmetrized ws - like form factors defined by @xmath222 where @xmath223 and @xmath224 are the radius and diffuseness parameters , respectively .",
    "we find that the full cross section decreases for @xmath100 by more than 5 orders of magnitude , which exceeds the precision limits of our optical potential computer code . at",
    "forward angles the effect of the substitution is very small .",
    "this supports the conjecture that the suspect behavior in the @xmath213 nf and full cross sections arises from the cusp , which the usual ws potentials have at the origin .",
    "the cusp is expected to produce diffraction scattering for the low partial waves , which is equally distributed between the n and f subamplitudes .",
    "it is this effect that we observe , and which disappears on removing the cusp .",
    "similar effects , although masked by the limited range of the scale along the ordinate , are also observed in the @xmath0o + @xmath0o collision at @xmath219 1120 mev , as well as tentatively in the @xmath213 n @xmath225ca cross section .",
    "our new nf resummation procedure clearly improves the original fuller nf method , as is evident from the seven examples discussed here , and from those presented elsewhere @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "we obtain nf resummed cross sections that are more slowly varying and less structured than the fuller ones . on the one hand ,",
    "our results confirm the utility of nf methods for gaining insight into the properties of the subamplitudes responsible for complicated structures in cross sections . on the other hand ,",
    "they remind us of the empirical origin of nf methods , and suggest caution in the interpretation of results obtained from nf techniques .",
    "using different nf methods lets us check what parts of the resulting nf subamplitudes are independent of the particular technique used .",
    "only properties stable with respect to different nf methods , can be considered as manifestations of some physical phenomenon .",
    "in addition , we have shown that in all nf analyses , it is desirable to investigate the behavior of the lam .",
    "this quantity is more sensitive to interference effects than are the nf cross sections , and a null value ( or an oscillatory behavior around zero ) of the nf lam in a certain angular range may indicate the dominance of an unphysical contribution ."
