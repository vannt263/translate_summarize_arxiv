    "the fact that early - type galaxies in clusters and groups define sequences in the colour - magnitude and surface brightness - luminosity diagrams has been known for a long time ( ( e.g . * ? ? ?",

    "* ) ; @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* b ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "these relations are expected to provide clues about the evolutionary status of the galaxies that follow them and they seem to be universal .",
    "such universality led several authors to suggest their use as reliable distance indicators ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and to set membership criteria ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the faint end of these photometric relations is populated by very faint dwarf elliptical ( de ) and dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies . despite morphological criteria have been proven useful for identifying dwarf galaxies in nearby clusters and groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fs90 ) , background galaxies may mimic dwarf morphologies if they are not observed with sufficient spatial resolution ( see , for example , object 27 in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this fact may introduce a significant contamination into the observed relations and may cause disagreements in their interpretation .",
    "examples of discrepancies that deserve some analysis are those related with the linearity and the scatter of the colour  magnitude relation ( cmr ) .",
    "most cmrs show no perceptible change of slope from luminous galaxies to the dwarf regime ( @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter paperi ; @xcite ) except , perhaps , at the very bright end ( see fig.8b in @xcite and fig.3 in @xcite )",
    ". however , non - linear trends for the cmr of the virgo cluster have been found @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a considerable increase in the scatter of all cmrs towards their faint end in comparison to that displayed by the brightest galaxies .",
    "it is still under discussion whether such increase has a physical origin pointing to differences in ages , metal abundances or formation scenarios among dwarf galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or whether it can be accounted for by photometric errors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "mean effective surface brightness relations , regarding particularly the behaviour of their faint ends . in order to analyze the structure of the antlia cluster",
    ", we study the projected spatial distribution of the whole galaxy sample .    in addition , we have confirmed the existence of two compact elliptical ( ce ) galaxies in antlia ( @xcite , hereafter paperii ; @xcite ) .",
    "these are rare low - mass systems ; about only a dozen have been identified within a distance of @xmath4 mpc ( @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) and a similar amount at larger distances @xcite .",
    "we include these two peculiar confirmed members in our analysis thus contributing to the discussion of the alleged dichotomy between bright and faint elliptical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as ces are thought to be either the extension to low luminosities of the family of giant ellipticals ( @xcite and references therein ) or not ( @xcite ) .    finally , physical characteristics of the dsph candidates are compared to galaxies of the same type in other groups and clusters .",
    "the dsphs are particularly interesting as they are supposed to be the faintest systems containing dark matter and can be used to constrain cold dark matter ( cdm ) models of galaxy formation ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . due to their low surface brightness",

    "this paper is based on photometric data obtained from ctio - mosaic and vlt - fors1 images of the central region of antlia , and radial velocities measured from gemini - gmos and magellan - mike spectra .",
    "antlia is the third nearest well populated galaxy cluster after virgo and fornax . before our studies on antlia ( @xcite ; paperi ; paperii ) ,",
    "the photographic work of fs90 was the last major effort devoted to study the faint galaxy content in this cluster .",
    "they identified , by visual inspection on photographic plates , 375 galaxies in their antlia group catalogue down to @xmath5 mag . among them , 252 are classified as dwarf galaxies or probable dwarf objects , 71 of which are found in our frames .",
    "only 15 of these 71 galaxies had measured radial velocities at that moment .",
    "our spectra have allowed us to add 23 new radial velocities to this sample ( 16 early - type and 3 late - type members plus 4 background galaxies ) , and to detect 5 previously unclassified new antlia members .",

    "the reduction was performed using a combination of the iraf package , and the package written by jack baldwin for dealing with the tilted slits in mike spectra ( available at the lco website ) .    using the gemini - gmos spectra ,",
    "radial velocities were measured with the iraf task by means of cross - correlation against simple stellar population ( ssp ) templates suitably selected from the miles database @xcite . in table[velocidades ] we list the error weighted average values , and the corresponding errors , obtained for each galaxy with the four templates used ( [ z / h]= -0.71 , 0.0 ; ages 7.4 and 10.0 gyrs ) . in the case of galaxies showing bright emission lines , these were used to check and refine the previously measured radial velocities . for the ce galaxy fs90192 we obtained the radial velocity value by fitting gaussian profiles with the task within iraf , to h@xmath21 and the caii triplet lines .",
    "we have obtained new radial velocities for 23 fs90 galaxies . among them , 20 have become new confirmed members of the antlia cluster , and 3 are background galaxies .",

    "we recall that fs90 assigned to each galaxy listed in their antlia catalogue a membership status : 1 for definite members , 2 for likely members and 3 for possible members .",
    "this assignment was based on morphological criteria as only 6 per cent of the listed galaxies had radial velocity determinations at the moment of the catalogue publication .    in general , we confirm the morphological / membership classification assigned by fs90 .",
    "the exceptions are two ce galaxies ( fs90110 and fs90192 ) that are new members of antlia and were originally considered just as  possible \" members , two galaxies originally classified as  possible \" and  likely \" de members , which turned out to be an antlia member ( fs90103 ) and a background systems ( fs90  205 ) , and a confirmed member but with a different ( irregular ) morphology ( fs90  221 ) .",
    "as expected , in some objects we are able to see features like nuclei , spiral arms or knots of star formation , thanks to the spatial resolution of our ccd images .",
    "all status 1 galaxies of the spectroscopic sample became confirmed members , while only two of the 20 spectroscopically confirmed antlia members were classified as status 3 galaxies by fs90 ( fs90110 and fs90192 , the new ce antlia galaxies ) .",
    "adding up the 23 fs90 galaxies with new radial velocities presented in this paper with the 37 already presented in paper i , we have the following statistics : cluster membership is confirmed for 100% ( 31/31 ) of fs90 status 1 galaxies , 81% ( 13/16 ) of status 2 ones , and 54% ( 7/13 ) of status 3 objects .",
    "this agrees with previous works in the ngc5044 group @xcite , showing that morphologically assigned memberships are still reliable ( mainly for diffuse dwarfs ) out to distances of @xmath22mpc .    with the addition of the new data",
    ", we will revisit the photometric relations of early - type galaxies in the central region of antlia considering spectroscopically confirmed fs90 members and fs90 galaxies with membership status 1 displaying early - type morphologies .",
    "this criterion will allow us to extend the cmr relation down to @xmath23mag , minimizing contamination by background galaxies lacking radial velocities in this subsample .",
    "we have measured with the task ellipse within iraf some galaxies presented with sextractor @xcite photometry in paperi ( see table[tabla_ell ] ) in order to compare the measurements obtained with these two softwares ( see appendix[ell_sex ] ) . as bright galaxies were all measured with ellipse due to saturation in their central regions ( see paperi for details ) , we will consider these new photometry in our diagrams and in the different fits performed to the photometric relations .",
    "we have obtained radial velocities for five new antlia members that were not in the fs90 catalogue .",

    "in fig.[fig2_ch4 ] we show the logarithmically scaled @xmath8 images of these galaxies .",
    "all of them show what seems to be a nucleus .",
    "this is a selection effect , as a bright central nucleus turns out to be necessary for obtaining reliable radial velocities from absorption - line spectra of faint diffuse galaxies .",
    "our spectroscopic data include other low - surface brightness objects without nuclei for which it was not possible to obtain a redshift .",
    "their photometric data were obtained through sextractor or ellipse , depending if the object was detected by the former software or not .",

    "we have performed a visual search on the @xmath8 mosaic image for new dwarf galaxy candidates based on morphological criteria .",
    "we looked for extended objects displaying low - surface brightnesses , that do not show substructure or evidence of star formation in the @xmath9 mosaic frame .",
    "for those objects falling into the deeper fors and gmos frames , we have also checked their morphologies by examining their appearance in these deeper images .    as these galaxies are not included in ned , we will designate them in the same way as new de antlia members .",
    "we present their images in fig.[fig_new_dwarfs ] .",
    "we obtained integrated magnitudes and colours for all but one of the 16 new dwarf systems ( see table[candidates ] ) .",
    "these measurements were performed in the way described in section2 of paperi through sextractor and ellipse , or with phot within iraf .",
    "the seven candidates that have no structural parameters determinations are either too faint and diffuse , or are located near bright galaxies or stars which prevented a more exhaustive photometric analysis .    in particular , we are interested in identifying counterparts of local group dsph galaxies as they will represent the very faint end of the dwarf galaxy population in antlia , certainly missed in the fs90 antlia catalogue .",

    "in order to test the results found by @xcite in abell 901/902 regarding the existence of a colour  density relation in the projected radial distribution , we divided our dwarf galaxy sample into systems displaying redder and bluer colours than the mean cmr .    from fig.[cmr_esferoides ] and table[ajustes ]",
    ", we can see that spectroscopically confirmed members define a tight relation down to @xmath54 mag with no change of slope or increase in the scatter .",
    "the new dwarf galaxy candidates seem to extend the relation down to @xmath55 mag , although introducing a considerable dispersion in the cmr at its very faint end . in particular , dsph candidates tend to increase the scatter towards bluer colours than the mean relation . in comparison with the results presented in paperi ,",
    "the cmr gets slightly steeper with the addition of the new confirmed members .",
    "when fs90 non confirmed members are included in the fit , both the slope of the cmr and its scatter increase .",
    "the selection of the spectroscopic targets was performed independently of their location in the photometric relations analyzed in this paper .",
    "the gemini - gmos fields were chosen to include as many fs90 galaxy candidates as possible .",
    "therefore , it is remarkable that all early - type confirmed members suite so well in the cmr . in addition , we can see that spectroscopically confirmed background galaxies included in the fs90 antlia catalogue , as well as di and bcd confirmed members , would introduce a substantial dispersion to the relation if they were wrongly considered as early - type cluster members .",
    "the new confirmed ce galaxies share the same cmr as `` normal '' early - type dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , as can be seen from the data included in table  [ ajustes ] , they increase the dispersion of the relation defined by dwarf confirmed members towards the red side of the colour - magnitude diagram . when these peculiar galaxies are excluded from the fit ,",
    "faint early - type members define a cmr with a similar scatter to that traced by bright ones .",
    "the location of both ces in the cmr diagram is consistent with a luminosity fading ( @xmath56mag for fs90110 , and @xmath57mag for fs90192 ) at constant colour .",
    "magnitude versus mean effective surface brightness diagram for antlia definite and confirmed members plus new dwarf galaxy candidates and members .",
    "the dashed line shows the locus of constant effective radius ( @xmath58 1 kpc ) followed by fs90 galaxies fainter than @xmath59mag ( paperi ) .",
    "new dwarf galaxy candidates tend to depart towards smaller @xmath60 .",
    "the dotted line shows the theoretical effect of isophotal truncation ( at 26.0 magarcsec@xmath61 ) on the galaxy surface brightness distributions at the faint end of the relation .",

    "we show , as a dashed line , the locus of constant effective radius ( @xmath63kpc ) found for galaxies fainter than @xmath64 mag in paperi .",
    "recall that lines parallel to this locus towards fainter luminosities correspond to smaller effective radii ( see eq.1 in paperi ) .    for our new sample of dwarf early - type members and candidates , we obtain a mean effective radius of @xmath65 ( rms 0.31 ) kpc , considering 57 galaxies with @xmath66 mag and excluding the two ces which represent extreme cases .",
    "however , we see that both fs90 and new confirmed members fainter than @xmath67 mag tend to depart from the linear relation towards smaller effective radii . when only dwarf galaxies in the range @xmath68 are considered , the mean effective radius increases to @xmath69 ( rms 0.28 ) kpc .",
    "one possible explanation for the faint break is that it arises due to the isophotal limit of our photometry , which causes different fractions of galaxy luminosity to be lost outside the limiting isophote for galaxies with different profile shapes . in order to quantify this effect",
    ", we considered a set of srsic models spanning an appropriate magnitude range , with shape parameters ( @xmath70 ) following the luminosity  shape relation given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig.10 ) .",
    "we fixed the effective radii of all the models at 1kpc ( 5.87 arcsec at the antlia cluster distance ) , and we then computed for each model the fraction of light lost outside the limiting radius , and the effective radius `` measured '' from the truncated profile ( see * ? ? ? * for the relevant expressions ) .",
    "we thus obtained for each model the values of isophotal magnitude and mean effective surface brightness that would be measured from a truncated profile .",
    "we show the results in fig.[mueff_esferoides ] , where the dotted line follows the isophotal magnitude versus mean effective surface brightness relations for srsic models truncated at isophotal radii corresponding to 26.0 mag arcsec@xmath61 . while profile truncation always leads to a magnitude dimming and a lower measured @xmath71 , low @xmath70 ( i.e. , fainter ) galaxies are more strongly affected than galaxies with @xmath72 .",
    "this gives a curved relation in the observed magnitude vs. mean effective surface brightness plane , which should be a straight line for galaxies with the same effective radius .",
    "then , the downturn of the relation for our dwarfs at faint galaxy magnitudes may be attributed to this effect , corresponding to our limiting isophote of about 26.0 magarcsec@xmath61 . the same departure towards fainter magnitudes of the dwarfs at the faint end of this relation , with respect to the general trend ,",
    "is present in the compilation from different environments by @xcite .",
    "both ce galaxies clearly depart from the locus of constant effective radius but , at first glance , in a different manner .",
    "fs90110 seems to extend the break defined by the brightest galaxies towards fainter magnitudes , but fs90192 is located with the bulk of early - type dwarf galaxies defining what could be their low limiting @xmath60 . if we calculate for their luminosities the corresponding @xmath62 on the locus of @xmath73kpc , we obtain that they differ from the measured values in @xmath74 mag arcsec@xmath61 for fs90110 , and @xmath75 mag arcsec@xmath61 for fs90192 .",
    "therefore both ce galaxies depart from the trend defined by early - type dwarf galaxies in a similar manner , defining what could be a photometric criterion to identify candidate ce galaxies .",
    "alternatively , the location of the ces with respect to the surface brightness - luminosity relation can be judged as consistent with a stripping scenario .",
    "the luminosity  effective radius diagram presented by @xcite in abell 901/902 ( their fig .",
    "2a ) , shows that their galaxies scatter about a mean constant effective radius . in figure[mueff_esferoides ] , the galaxies located below the dashed line have @xmath76 kpc and those found above the line , @xmath77 .",
    "we see that early - type dwarfs in the central region of antlia , either redder or bluer than the colour of the mean cmr , show similar effective radii , in agreement with barazza et al.s findings .",
    "in particular , red dwarfs ( excluding the two ces , 16 galaxies ) display a mean effective radius @xmath78 ( rms 0.34 ) kpc , while blue dwarfs ( 33 systems ) , @xmath79 ( rms 0.30 ) kpc .    we have also plotted , with green squares , the data corresponding to the study of the early - type galaxy population in poor groups performed by @xcite . the bright and faint early - type systems in these groups ,",
    "follow the same luminosity@xmath62 relation as antlia galaxies with a similar scatter .      .",
    "red and blue symbols depict dwarf galaxies displaying redder and bluer colours than the mean cmr , respectively .",
    "north is up and east to the left . ]    in fig.[posiciones ] we show the location of our galaxy sample in the mosaic field .",
    "two concentrations of galaxies are present around ngc3258 and ngc3268 , respectively , with a poorly populated zone between them .",
    "both concentrations are similar in number of galaxies , contain several bright lenticulars , and in each of them there is a ce galaxy placed in the neighbourhood of the dominant system .",
    "@xcite have shown that redder dwarf early - type galaxies in abell 901/902 are located closer to the central cluster galaxies than bluer ones of similar luminosity . in our case",
    "the mean distances of the dwarfs to each one of the two dominant galaxies ( the closer one ) are : 8.0 ( rms 4.8 ) arcmin for the 20 dwarfs redder than the mean cmr at the same luminosity , and 7.7 ( rms 4.3 ) arcmin for 37 dwarfs bluer than the mean cmr .",
    "if we consider the luminosity ranges @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , we obtain , respectively , mean distances of 8.2 ( rms 6.1 ) arcmin ( 7 red dwarfs ) and 8.4 ( rms 4.8 ) arcmin ( 12 blue dwarfs ) , 8.3 ( rms 5.6 ) arcmin ( 7 red dwarfs ) and 7.6 ( rms 4.5 ) arcmin ( 20 blue dwarfs ) , and 7.4 ( rms 2.0 ) arcmin ( 6 red dwarfs ) and 5.9 ( rms 1.1 ) arcmin ( 5 blue dwarfs ) .",
    "therefore , we do not find a clear trend in the sense of that reported by barazza et al .",
    "however , this differences are rather marginal , and should be tested with a larger sample including the outer regions of antlia .",
    "the cmr of early - type galaxies in groups and clusters of galaxies is a well known photometric relation that has been studied for long . in the colour - magnitude diagram ,",

    "the physical interpretation of this feature has been the subject of numerous observational and theoretical studies . while luminosity or brightness can be easily associated with the ( stellar ) mass of a galaxy , the well known _ age - metallicity _ degeneracy prevents a clear physical identification for integrated colours .    from the study of photometric indices correlated with line strenghts for 31 elliptical galaxies belonging to pairs or small groups ,",
    "@xcite has found that , for the redder galaxies of the sample , the differences in integrated colours are correlated with variations in abundances . in a more recent work ,",
    "@xcite have studied the @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 spectral absorption line indices of 101 galaxies in the coma cluster .",
    "they found that the cmr in coma is mainly driven by a luminosity  metallicity effect .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite about fornax and virgo elliptical galaxies .",
    "they are basically old stellar systems and define a mass  metallicity trend , in contrast with field ellipticals , where age and @xmath87-element fraction may be more strongly correlated with stellar mass than overall metallicity .",
    "this finding for field galaxies is confirmed by @xcite ; however , his sample covers a small luminosity range which strongly limits any analysis of correlations involving absolute magnitudes .",
    "@xcite show the mid - ir cmr for early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster with absolute k - band magnitudes between -26 and -19 . by comparing their results with those of optical studies ,",
    "they conclude that the cmr is driven by metallicity effects , as a mass  age relation would produce a slope in the opposite sense to that observed .",
    "observations of clusters at intermediate redshift showed that the slope of the cmr display small variations with redshift ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "hence , although other stellar population parameters like age and @xmath87-element fraction are shown to depend on the luminosity of early - type galaxies , and this behaviour is shown to depend on the environment , a clear mass - metallicity relation holds through different environments , from rich clusters to the local group , spanning more than 5 decades in @xmath88 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".    within the discussion of the cmr in antlia it may be thus interesting to turn , as a comparison , to the ngc5044 group , a relaxed galaxy aggregate intermediate between small groups and rich clusters @xcite , where early - type galaxies are also found to follow a well - defined cmr spanning @xmath89 mag in luminosity @xcite .",

    "a low metal content is , however , their general characteristic , and should be the main driver of their optical integrated colours .",
    "therefore , despite the identification of the physical mechanisms involved in defining the cmr is still an open issue , there is strong evidence that the cmr should be mainly interpreted as a mass  metallicity relation .",
    "it is widely accepted that the cmr is linear along its extension , and that it shows no perceptible change of slope from the bright galaxies to the dwarf regime ( @xcite ; paper i ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition there is strong evidence for the universality of this relation in clusters of galaxies .",
    "@xcite have found that early - type galaxies in virgo and coma present _ identical _ @xmath90 and @xmath91 colours , following the same linear cmr .",
    "@xcite found , for the perseus cluster , a fit to the bright end of the cmr in agreement to that derived by @xcite for the coma cluster .",

    "in addition , it is still under discussion whether there is a genuine ( i.e. , with a physical origin ) increase in the scatter of the cmr towards its faint end or , instead , the larger scatter can be accounted for by photometric or classification errors and/or background galaxies contamination .    in the perseus cluster ,",
    "@xcite have found a significant spread ( @xmath92 0.5 mag ) around the mean cmr , in the colours of galaxies with @xmath93 mag .",

    "when unconfirmed members and confirmed background galaxies are introduced in the relation , it displays a larger colour dispersion , not only in its faint end but also at intermediate luminosities . in fig.2b of paperi",
    "we included in the same colour  magnitude diagram fs90 galaxies with spiral and irregular morphologies , some of them with spectroscopically confirmed membership .",
    "these objects introduced considerable dispersion towards the blue side of the relation , in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "the revised slope of the relation for all definite members is steeper than that found in paperi .",
    "however , this value is in agreement with the one found in that paper for the bright end of the relation .",
    "therefore , the bright galaxies seem to define the slope of the relation and when confirmed early - type dwarf members are included in the analysis , the faint galaxies follow a relation with a similar slope and scatter .",
    "this steeper value for the slope of the cmr of antlia is still consistent with those reported for other galaxy clusters .",

    "regarding the positions in the colour - magnitude diagram of the confirmed antlia ces , they can be compared with those displayed by the ce galaxies recently identified in centaurus @xcite and coma ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "centaurus ces are located within the cmr on its red side , in a similar manner to antlia s ces ( see fig.3 in * ? ? ?",
    "despite all confident coma s ces ( namely , ccgv9a , ccgv19a and ccgv19b ) are found on the red side of coma s mean cmr , only one of them shows a similar location to those found in antlia and centaurus ( that is , within or near the general trend ) , while the other two display a considerable offset from the mean relation towards redder colours and/or fainter brightnesses ( see fig.2 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "coma s ces have age and abundances estimations .",

    "therefore , in all these clusters , the increase of the scatter starts at different absolute magnitudes , which tend to be brighter for more distant clusters , if virgo is excluded from the sample .",
    "this trend could be interpreted as a diminishing of the precision of the photometric data and a more uncertain morphological / membership classification as we go to more distant clusters .    from the analysis",
    "performed in [ s.cmra ] , it might be inferred that , once photometric errors are discounted , different cmrs obtained using metallicity sensitive colours , like @xmath2 and @xmath104 , display fairly low intrinsic dispersions ( @xmath133mag ) .",

    "whatever the process dominating the intrinsic scatter is , from our comparison we could say that it arises with similar strength in different clusters . in this sense , @xcite have found a colour scatter with no evolution with redshift or correlation with the velocity dispersions of the clusters included in their analysis .        as it was shown in section[mueff ] , in a plot of @xmath1 magnitude versus @xmath62 ,",

    "the mean effective radius of the confirmed members with @xmath136 mag is @xmath137 ( rms 0.26 ) kpc .",
    "therefore , there seems to be a faint limit in magnitude for the constant effective radius relation followed by des .",
    "we have already mentioned that this could be due to the isophotal limit of our photometry .",
    "it is possible that we are not reaching the most external regions of the galaxies as they are embedded in the background .",
    "many of these faint objects are located near brighter galaxies as well . in this way",
    ", our effective radius could be underestimated for galaxies fainter than @xmath138 mag ( @xmath139 mag , @xcite ) , leading to the apparent discontinuity or `` break '' in this relation .",
    "however , @xcite have found that newly discovered dwarf galaxies in the m81 group ( @xmath140 mpc ) , have effective radii in agreement to those found for the new dwarf galaxies in antlia , i.e. @xmath141 kpc ( see their table 3 ) .",
    "local group dsphs have @xmath141 kpc , as well ( @xcite , and references therein ) . @xcite as well as",
    "@xcite found a similar trend to our faint break , in their respective samples of dwarf galaxies .",
    "therefore , we can not rule out the possibility that the luminosity vs. @xmath62 relation , corresponding to a mean constant effective radius of @xmath142 kpc , presents two physical breaks : one at magnitudes brighter than @xmath143 mag , and another at its faint end , at magnitudes fainter than @xmath144 mag .",
    "we recall that the correlation between luminosity and @xmath62 for magnitudes brighter than @xmath143 mag corresponds to the @xcite scaling relation defined by bright es and bulges of s galaxies on the @xmath145 vs. @xmath146 diagram .",

    "as mentioned above in this section , most of the galaxies fainter than the low luminosity break are located near brighter ones .",

    "surface brightness profiles displaying a break , as is the case of fs90110 ( see paperii ) would favour this interpretation @xcite .",
    "@xcite have argued that , with the exception of the very bright galaxies ( @xmath147 , @xmath148 , i.e. `` core '' e ) , the break at the bright end of the luminosity versus @xmath62 relation is not due to different formation mechanisms among dwarf and bright e galaxies .",
    "they emphasize that both type of galaxies display continuous trends in the central surface brightness ( @xmath149 ) versus luminosity plot , and in the @xmath70 srsic index @xcite versus luminosity diagram .",

    "@xcite sustain the existence of a dichotomy between de ( _ spheroidal _ galaxies in their paper ) and e galaxies pointing to distinct origins .",
    "the fact that e and de follow similar correlations would indicate that the parameters involved in such relations are not sensitive to the physics that makes them different . therefore , these authors consider that to distinguish galaxy types it is necessary to use all parameter correlations and find out which ones are sensitive to formation mechanisms . from an extensive analysis ,",
    "kormendy et al .",
    "conclude that e galaxies form via mergers being ce galaxies their low luminosity counterparts , while de are late - type galaxies transformed by environmental effects and by energy feedback from supernovae .    in this context",
    "it is interesting to point out the top panel of figure 1 in the work by @xcite .",
    "there the authors show the location in the @xmath62luminosity diagram of all ces detected by them with the virtual observatory ( 21 objects ) , along other confirmed ces and early - type systems .",
    "it can be seen that m32 seems to extend the locus defined by bright early - type galaxies towards brighter values of @xmath62 ( or smaller @xmath60 ) .",
    "but the rest of the ces included in the plot seem to define a parallel sequence to that of des and ds0s , towards brighter @xmath62 . simulating the interaction of a disk galaxy with a galaxy cluster potential",
    ", @xcite also found that tidal stripping can reduce the stellar mass of the galaxy and speculate that low - luminosity objects could be the progenitors of ces .",
    "considering that most ( if not all ) ces are companions of brighter galaxies , it might be interpreted that the offset of different ce galaxies from the de / ds0 sequence depends on the degree of interaction experienced by the system and/or on the morphology of the progenitor . in this sense , ce galaxies would not be thought as the natural extension of the family of giant ellipticals towards low luminosities , as the origins of both populations would be quite different .",
    "it is worth noting that our two ce galaxies also seem to lie along a sequence parallel to that of des rather than to follow the trend of bright ellipticals .",
    "it is clear that the interpretation of the behaviour of bright and dwarf early - type galaxies in the luminosity@xmath62 diagram is an open question . our present results for the antlia cluster do not show any discontinuity between bright and dwarf ones in this diagram , but it should be taken into account that bright early - type galaxies in antlia are mainly lenticulars , not ellipticals .",
    "in addition , we should enlarge the photometric sample at the low - luminosity end before arriving at sensible conclusions .    at the moment",
    ", it is not possible to discern if @xmath62 keeps almost constant from the faint break towards fainter magnitudes , or if the effective surface brightness increases with decreasing luminosity , showing a similar trend to that displayed by e galaxies .",
    "however , it is remarkable the good match showed by the galaxies belonging to poor groups to the locus of constant effective radius defined by antlia s systems .",
    "this fact is pointing to a relation that arises with similar characteristics in very different environments .",
    "x - ray observations of the antlia cluster @xcite , have shown that the x - ray diffuse emission is elongated in the direction defined by a line joining both dominant galaxies .",
    "studies of the globular cluster systems of ngc3258 and ngc3268 @xcite have revealed that these systems display an elongated distribution in the same direction .",
    "these results may be the consequence of tidal forces between both galaxies , which may be ultimately pointing to an ongoing merger in the central region of antlia .",
    "thus , the two structures found in this region ( fig.[posiciones ] ) might be two groups in interaction : one with ngc3258 as dominant galaxy , and other with ngc3268 as the central galaxy , both of them containing a ce galaxy .",
    "more radial velocities from galaxies in the outer regions of antlia are needed to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "we have shown in section[distribution ] that there is no conclusive evidence of the existence of a colour  density relation in antlia in the sense reported by @xcite for abell 901/902 .",
    "these authors propose that the existence of this relation in the projected radial distribution is an indication that the formation of des is closely related to the processes that affect the cluster itself , like ram - pressure stripping and harassment .",
    "the ram - pressure stripping would remove more efficiently ( and faster ) the interstellar medium of galaxies located closer to cluster centres . that may affect star formation in a way that these galaxies would have , on the average , an older stellar population and thus be redder than galaxies located further away from the cluster centres .",
    "the harassment scenario predicts a colour gradient in terms of effective radius @xcite , in the sense that bluer ( outskirts ) galaxies display larger @xmath145 than the redder ( central ) ones . in agreement with barazza et",
    "results , we do not find a relation between colour and effective radius . in this context , as the early - type dwarf galaxy populations of antlia and abell 901/902 do not show such a gradient , the harassment process seems not to be a dominant one in these associations . @xcite",
    "have also found that the lack of correlations with clustercentric distances in the scaling relations favours a ram - pressure stripping scenario for the evolution of the galaxies .",
    "our selection of the low luminosity dsph candidates in antlia was mainly based on their limiting magnitude ( @xmath150 mag , @xcite ) and morphology ( diffuse appearance and no nucleus ) .",
    "local group counterparts of these objects are also devoid of gas and dominated by old and intermediate - age stars . their extended sizes , low luminosity and measured velocity dispersions , as well as their large mass - to - light ratios , point to dsph being objects with large amounts of dark matter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our new dsph candidates have integrated magnitudes in the range @xmath151 mag , which corresponds to @xmath152 . in agreement with the tidal origin proposed for dsph galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "most dsphs are located within a radius of 300 kpc from the milky way and m31 @xcite .",
    "though our dsph candidates sample in antlia is in fact small , their positions displayed in fig.[posiciones ] and identified by open pentagons , place them close to the two giant dominant galaxies or to bright lenticulars , all of them confirmed cluster members .",
    "their average projected distance to the closest bright galaxy ( with @xmath153 mag ) is @xmath154 arcmin , which at the antlia distance correponds to about @xmath155 65 kpc .    regarding their sizes ,",
    "the study of dsphs in m31 by @xcite has shown that their tidal radii ( @xmath156kpc ) are about twice as extended as their counterparts in the milky way .",
    "the classical dsphs ( i.e. , not including the newly discovered ultra faint dwarfs ) surrounding the milky way have tidal radii in the range @xmath157 kpc to 3 kpc @xcite .",
    "even their spatial distribution is different , being the milky way satellites more clustered around their host than those of m31 @xcite .",
    "globally , we can consider that tidal radii of local group dsphs range from @xmath58 0.5 to 7 kpc , which correspond to @xmath155 3 - 45 arcsec at the antlia distance . from table[candidates ] , we can see that the antlia dsph candidates display total radii in the range 5 - 11 arcsec , that is within the expected values if we compare to the local group ones , though in the range of the smaller sizes . this can be understood like a selection effect , as it would be even more difficult to detect larger , but more diffuse , galaxies at the antlia distance .",
    "in this paper we have deepened our study of the galaxy populations in the central region of the antlia cluster , paying particular attention to the faint systems composed by dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals .",
    "we have obtained radial velocities for a total of 28 faint galaxies ( @xmath158 mag ) located in this region through gemini - gmos and magellan ",

    "in addition , images in the @xmath8 band are shown for all the galaxies with new radial velocities and the 16 new candidates .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows : + - early - type galaxies in the antlia cluster follow a tight colour - magnitude relation that extends , with no perceptible change of slope , from the giant ellipticals down to the dsphs spanning almost 12 magnitudes in luminosity . when only confirmed early - type members",
    "are considered , we find no significant increase in the scatter towards the faint end of the relation . when the intrinsic scatter of the cmr of antlia is compared with those of other groups and clusters cmrs , it is found that antlia s cmr is one of the tightest relations reported up to now .",
    "we suggest that this finding is related with the use of a metallicity sensitive colour index like @xmath2 .",
    "+ - the five previously unknown early - type antlia members and the 16 new candidates follow the same photometric relations as the fs90 early - type members and candidates , although introducing some dispersion .",
    "in particular , the new dwarf candidates increase the scatter of the cmr towards its faint end . these new dwarf members and",

    "however , similar sizes ( @xmath161kpc ) have been reported for faint members of the local group , m81 and ngc5044 groups .",
    "therefore , there seems to exist a physical brightness limit for the relation corresponding to constant effective radius , a relation that seems to arise in different environments as it has been found in clusters like virgo and coma ( see fig . 5 in paperi ) as well as in poor groups .",

    "however , the ce galaxies found in coma present [ fe / h ] abundances comparable to those of some des . therefore , at the moment it is difficult to establish if ces should be treated as a separate class of objects , or should be considered as part of the general early - type dwarf galaxy family experiencing , perhaps , particular dynamical processes .",
    "+ - we have found a small sample of 7 unstudied dsph candidates , whose membership can not be confirmed with our spectra due to their low surface brightness .",
    "they cover a range in integrated magnitudes @xmath152 and total radii between 5 and 11 arcsec , which at the antlia distance correspond to approximately 850 pc  2 kpc .",
    "they are found close to bright galaxies ( @xmath165mag ) , being their average projected distance from them of @xmath166kpc .",
    "+ - the projected spatial distribution of the whole sample points to a complex structure for antlia .",
    "at least two groups are present in the central region , with some evidence of an ongoing merger .",
    "we will extend our study adding new fields adjoining the central one , and increasing the spectroscopic data set , in order to add kinematic information to the spatial distribution .",

    "we have obtained the cmr from colours and magnitudes measured with sextractor and with ellipse .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to quantify if there are significant differences between these two ways of obtaining photometry .",
    "to this aim , in figures  [ t1_ell_sex ] we show plots comparing @xmath1 magnitudes , @xmath2 colours , and effective radii obtained with sextractor and ellipse .    in the left panel of figure[t1_ell_sex ] , we see that for luminosities in the range @xmath173 , magnitudes obtained from sextractor and ellipse agree well , the mean offset being @xmath174 . however , there are significant differences for @xmath175mag , that can be as large as 1.14 mag .",
    "the mean offset for faint galaxies is @xmath176 mag . in the case of @xmath9 magnitudes ( no plot is shown ) , considerable offsets arise for @xmath177mag . for magnitudes brighter than this limit we obtained @xmath178 and for fainter ones , @xmath179mag .    in the central panel of figure[t1_ell_sex ] , we show the differences in @xmath2 colours as @xmath180 as a function of the ellipse luminosity of the galaxy . for @xmath181mag , offsets as large as @xmath182 mag might arise for some objects : 6 galaxies out of 30 ( 20 per cent ) present @xmath183mag .",
    "when effective radii are compared ( righ panel of figure[t1_ell_sex ] ) , those obtained by sextractor tend to be larger than those found by ellipse . in the plot , we considered @xmath184 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath185mag , the mean offset is @xmath186 arcsec and for @xmath187mag , @xmath188 arcsec .    despite these differences , we see from both panels of figure[t1_ell_sex2 ] that our conclusions about the colour - magnitude and luminosity@xmath62 relations almost do not change by considering photometry obtained by one way or another .",
    "the slope and zero point of both cmrs are similar , and the locus of constant effective radius arise naturally in both samples .",
    "sextractor photometry seems to introduce some additional scatter at the faint end of the relation , while ellipse slightly increases the dispersion at intermediate brightness .",
    "the luminosity@xmath146 relation presents lower scatter when the sextractor photometry is considered .",
    "however , the break at the faint end of the relation is found in both samples . in the case of fs90192 ,",
    "one of the ce galaxies , it can be seen that its location away from the locus of constant effective radius towards higher values of @xmath62 , is similar in both cases .    from our findings",
    "we conclude that sextractor and ellipse are suitable to study mean photometric relations with a comparable level of confidence .",
    "however , for individual studies of low brightness galaxies , some care must be taken when considering colours and structural parameters ."
