    "<S> controlling the transport , trapping , and filtering of nanoparticles is important for many applications . by virtue of their weak response to gravity and their thermal motion , </S>",
    "<S> various physical mechanisms can be exploited for such operations on nanoparticles . however , the manipulation based on optical forces is potentially most appealing since it constitutes a highly deterministic approach . </S>",
    "<S> plasmonic nanostructures have been suggested for this purpose , but they possess the disadvantages of locally generating heat and trapping the nanoparticles directly on surface . </S>",
    "<S> here , we propose the use of dielectric rings made of high permittivity materials for trapping nanoparticles . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to their ability to strongly localize the field in space , nanoparticles can be trapped without contact . </S>",
    "<S> we use a semi - analytical method to study the ability of these rings to trap nanoparticles . </S>",

    "<S> the study of single isolated nanoparticles ( nps ) and their properties is important for understanding how they may mutually agglomerate as well as for how they interact with other types of matter . with the rising commercial use and large - scale production of engineered nps </S>",
    "<S> , methods to capture and filter nps are needed for environmental and health - care aspects but also to assure a sustainable nanotechnology . </S>",
    "<S> disciplines such as analytical chemistry  @xcite and nanotoxicology  @xcite are concerned with methods to characterize nanomaterials with respect to their impact upon unintended exposure or , more generally , nanotoxicity . to perform research in these fields , access to a large number of nps and agglomerates in a specific experimental surrounding is required . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , these disciplines would benefit from basic physical processes that are capable to spatially and temporally control the motion of nps . </S>",
    "<S> going one step further , these processes may also be used in respirator function for protection in pandemic of respiratory diseases ( e.g , sars , bird and swine flu ) , where inhalation of nps , which can be easily aerosolized , is of great concern . </S>",

    "<S> both , a single trap and an array of traps may be envisioned as an active contactless electromagnetically controlled filter . </S>",
    "<S> our work exploits dielectrics as the material from which the ring is made . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to metallic rings studied in literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , scattering nanostructures from high permittivity dielectric materials were recently identified as a suitable platform to replace plasmonic structures in selected applications  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the extraordinary control of the multipolar composition of the scattered field combined with the vanishing absorption , dielectric structures are appealing in many instances . here , we explore the possibility of using such high permittivity scatterers to trap nps . here </S>",
    "<S> , air is assumed as the host ambient medium and , as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setup ] , one may introduce a substrate , which other than lowering the trapping frequencies slightly will have no other qualitative effects . in ambient air , the mean free path of the air molecules is @xmath12  nm . therefore , for particles with a diameter @xmath13 , the molecule - particle surface collisions are not small compared to molecule - molecule collisions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , without elaborating , it is reasonable to assume that a particle of mass @xmath14 at a position @xmath15 will obey the langevin equation @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the constants of gravity and dissipation , and the random force @xmath19 can be obtained from the fluctuation - dissipation relation . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to investigate the optical force @xmath20 as a means to trap the np . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we first introduce the numerical and theoretical approaches to compute the optical force based on maxwell s stress tensor and the induced multipole moments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then compute the exerted optical force on an isolated dielectric np illuminated by a plane wave . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards , we study the interaction of light with an isolated ring and show the presence of a field concentration ( hot spot ) . having characterized the field in close proximity to the ring , we place a spherical dielectric np at various positions and calculate the force exerted on it . </S>",
    "<S> this is obtained semi - analytically within dipole approximation while neglecting the scattered field generated by the np ( _ i.e. _ , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : forcets]-[eq : forcete ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> both approaches are shown to be in good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we obtain the trajectory of the np by considering various initial conditions and show that for the induced field , trapping is feasible .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by noting that for a host medium characterized by its permittivity @xmath21 and permeability @xmath22 , the time averaged optical force exerted on an arbitrarily shaped np is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a surface enclosing the particle , @xmath25 is the normal to @xmath24 , and @xmath26 is the time - averaged maxwell s stress tensor : @xmath27 . </S>",

    "<S> the response of an isolated ring to an @xmath54-polarized field is first obtained computationally using the finite elements method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ability of the dielectric ring to concentrate the energy into a finite spatial region that can be considered as a focusing effect is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : torus ] ( a)-(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of a hot spot can be observed about 700 to 800  nm below the ring . </S>",
    "<S> if we now assume the initial np position @xmath55 to be along the @xmath41-axis , we observe that the maximum field ( in the @xmath0-plane ) is formed when the particle is _ approximately _ within the hot spot region ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath56 800 nm ) , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : toruswithsphere ] ( a ) . for the chosen materials and particles , it is reasonable to assume that the scattered field generated by the np is negligible when compared to the field generated by the ring itself . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we may obtain the force on the spherical np semi - analytically by using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : forcets]-[eq : forcete ] , where the electric and magnetic fields are only due to the ring ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : torus ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this approximation is intended to simplify the computation of the force and therefore warrants a validation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we also calculate the force by using the self - consistent fields of the nanoparticle - ring configuration ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : toruswithsphere ] ) via integrating maxwell s stress tensor _ i.e. _ , eq .  </S>",

    "<S> all features are qualitatively and quantitatively present . </S>",
    "<S> having established that the semi - analytical method is sufficiently accurate , we will now proceed to obtain the trajectory of the np . here , the utility of the analytical results obtained can be appreciated when noting that solving the coupled navier - maxwell equations , using frequency ( maxwell ) and time ( navier ) domains , require significant computational resource .    </S>",
    "<S> as an example , we show in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : motionpotential ] the trapping trajectory of the np for a given initial condition . in order to obtain a proper trapping volume , an incident field with a circular polarization was employed as linearly polarized fields would yield an incomplete gradient . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a reasonable estimate for the np damping in air may be obtained in the range @xmath57  kg / s , as confirmed from experiments with a mechanical oscillator  @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> nm , @xmath58 nm , @xmath59 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we follow its trajectory during its trapping toward the final position ( @xmath60 nm , @xmath60 nm , @xmath61 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the particle has a radius of @xmath62 nm and a mass of @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> a damping force was introduced of @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the particle velocity , and @xmath66 kg / s is the damping parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we assumed an incident wave with an intensity of @xmath67 , which means that for a gaussian beam with a beam waist of @xmath68 m , we need a laser with an incident power of @xmath69 mw . ]    for most practical application of the presented concept in optical filtering , separation , and sorting , it is envisioned that large numbers of nanorings may need to be fabricated and integrated . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is worthwhile to consider the influence of neighboring rings on the field properties of a given trapping site . for this reason , we investigated the focusing effect of a single ring but employed periodic boundary conditions in the lateral directions ( @xmath70 plane ) . by monitoring the field magnitude at the location of the hot spot of an isolated ring as a function of the period </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained an estimate of a minimal ring separation distance of 800  nm required to sufficiently suppress the coupling . under such conditions , each ring in the array acts as an individual trapping site , supporting the design principle depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setup ] .    in conclusion , the modelled concept of a dielectric ring based field modulation theoretically proved to present a viable approach to optically trap dielectric nps . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial modification of the electromagnetic field and its enhancement by a factor of 5 , yielding a hot spot in the vicinity of the ring , was seen to provide a means to control the transport of nearby nps . </S>",
    "<S> nps distributed near the ring were shown to follow trajectories to entrapment under the engendered force field . </S>",
    "<S> considering the possibility of using metallic rings or other metallic nanostructures in conjunction with a dielectric ring and invoking thermoplasmonics  @xcite , one may envision applications where bacterial aerosolized particles may be trapped and killed by being subjected to heat . </S>",
    "<S> following the presented simulations , the special emphasis placed on the dielectric aspect of the traps can be assumed crucial for avoiding excessive absorption and thus heat generation which could impact biological applications . </S>"
