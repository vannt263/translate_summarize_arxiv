    "additionally , in the environment of exploding massive stars , which has long been explored as a possible site for the r - process nucleosynthesis , charged - current neutrino - nucleus reactions play an important role in the production of chemical elements . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are many interesting effects of neutrino - induced reactions before , during , and after the r - process . to explore their role in nucleosynthesis reliable neutrino - nucleus reaction rate compilations involving also nuclei with large neutron excess",
    "are required .",
    "available data on neutrino - nucleus cross sections are limited to deuterium  @xcite , and @xmath3c and @xmath4fe target nuclei , obtained by the lsnd  @xcite and karmen  @xcite collaborations , and at lampf  @xcite .",
    "therefore , only theoretical approaches can provide cross sections for a large number of target nuclei that are involved in various applications of neutrino physics and astrophysics .",
    "modeling neutrino - nucleus interactions is also important in view of the current research and development of neutrino detectors , e.g. , for supernova and solar neutrinos , neutrinos produced in laboratories , and geoneutrinos .",
    "the ongoing and planned neutrino detector facilities involve a variety of target materials , induced reactions and scientific objectives , e.g. , moon  @xcite , miniboone  @xcite , minos  @xcite , sno+  @xcite , opera  @xcite , lvd ( large volume detector)@xcite , orland experiment proposal at the spallation neutron source ( sns )  @xcite , nova neutrino experiment  @xcite , daya bay reactor neutrino experiment  @xcite , etc .",
    "there is also interesting concept of beta - beams for the production of neutrinos by using @xmath5-decay of boosted radioactive ions  @xcite .",
    "the proposal to establish a beta - beam facility that could produce low - energy neutrino beams in the 100 mev energy range would allow direct insight into the neutrino - induced reactions in nuclei as well as its underlying structure involving a non - trivial combination of nuclear allowed and forbidden transitions  @xcite .    at low neutrino energies ,",
    "the neutrino - induced reactions are sensitive to the properties of nuclei involved , i.e. their initial and excited states .",
    "therefore it is necessary to employ a microscopic framework providing reasonable description of nuclear structure properties . over the past years",
    ", a variety of advanced microscopic models have been developed and employed in studies of charged - current neutrino - induced reactions at low energies , also including various particle decay channels .",
    "in particular , these include the nuclear shell model  @xcite , random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite , continuum rpa ( crpa )  @xcite , and the hybrid model which combines the shell model for allowed transitions , with the rpa to account for the forbidden transitions  @xcite .",
    "frameworks based on quasiparticle rpa ( qrpa ) have also recently been developed , based on skyrme functionals  @xcite , brueckner g matrix employed for two - body interaction by solving the bethe - salpeter equation using bonn - cd potential  @xcite , and projected qrpa  @xcite .",

    "although the shell model provides a very accurate description of ground state wave functions , the description of high - lying excitations necessitates the use of large model spaces which often leads to computational difficulties , making the approach applicable essentially only to allowed transitions in light and medium - mass nuclei . for systematic studies of neutrino - nucleus cross sections throughout the nuclide chart including the heavy nuclei , microscopic calculations",
    "must therefore be performed using models based on the qrpa .",
    "the first global calculations of electron neutrino - nucleus cross sections have been conducted using the gross theory of @xmath5-decay  @xcite .",
    "two microscopic frameworks have been employed in large - scale calculations of neutrino - induced reactions i ) extended thomas - fermi plus strutinsky integral ( etfsi ) and continuum quasiparticle random phase approximation ( cqrpa )  @xcite , and ii ) rpa with landau - migdal ( lm ) force , using wood - saxon potential ( ws ) to determine the single - particle basis of target nuclei  @xcite .",
    "there are no up - to - date systematic calculations conducted in the framework of energy density functional .    recently the framework based on relativistic nuclear energy density functional ( rnedf ) has been introduced in modeling the charged - current neutrino - nucleus cross sections  @xcite , and it has also been extended for applications in modeling neutral - current neutrino - induced reactions  @xcite . in the case of iron group nuclei ,",
    "comparison of the results for charge exchange reactions obtained using skyrme functionals and the rnedf , as well as with the shell model , showed reasonable theoretical uncertainty inherent in modeling neutrino - nucleus cross sections .",
    "however , in view of applications in supernova and r - process simulations , which also involve unstable nuclei far from the valley of stability , where no experimental data are available , it is necessary to provide independent insight into relevant neutrino - induced processes from various models and effective interactions .",
    "the main objective of this work is conducting large - scale calculations of charged - current neutrino - nucleus cross sections in a large pool of nuclei from oxygen towards lead , based on the rnedf .",
    "in addition to the overall cross sections covering the range of neutrino energies up to 100 mev , calculations also include the cross sections averaged over neutrino fluxes for the range of temperatures characteristic of various stages of stellar evolution .",
    "in addition to the fermi - dirac neutrino spectra we also apply supernova spectra from a recent simulation that includes three - flavor boltzmann neutrino transport .",
    "particular aim of this work is to emphasize the role of forbidden transitions in modeling neutrino - nucleus cross sections in large pool of nuclei , including both stable and nuclei away from the valley of stability .",
    "the relevance of forbidden transitions has already been discussed in several studies , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite . in the study of neutrino capture by r - process waiting point nuclei , first forbidden strength , together with the low - lying gamow - teller transitions , increased the rate of neutrino scattering from very neutron - rich nuclei by a factor of at least 2 and in some instances even by a factor of 5  @xcite .",

    "we compare our results to the available sets of cross sections based on two other theoretical frameworks : etfsi + cqrpa  @xcite and rpa ( ws+lm )  @xcite , where the former contains only contributions from the gamow - teller and fermi transitions , while the latter includes all transitions up to @xmath43 .",

    "the difference is significant even for the lightest isotopes considered in this study . for nuclei with the proton - to - neutron ratio @xmath46 , the etfsi + cqrpa framework predicts a change of the general trend and an anomalous increase of the cross sections with a corresponding decrease of the number of neutrons .",
    "the agrement between results that take into accout forbidden transitions , rqrpa and rpa(ws+lm ) , is much better in all three isotopic chains , although for very neutron - rich ni and sn isotopes the rqrpa predicts higher values of the flux - averaged cross section . in the case of the pb isotopic chain ,",
    "the agreement between the rqrpa and rpa(ws+lm ) cross sections is excellent for all the isotopes under consideration .",
    "there are several reasons for the shown deviations .",
    "each model employs different effective interactions that result in variations of the excitation pattern contributing to the cross sections , and the present calculations are based on a fully self - consistent approach to the neutrino - induced reactions .",
    "the three models agree best for nuclei around the valley of stability , where most of the experimental data on nuclear structure properties are available . in the very neutron rich region",
    "the differences between various models increase and grow relatively large .",
    "however , in all three isotopic chains the agreement of the rqrpa results is much better with the values obtained using the rpa ( ws + lm ) model than with the etfsi + cqrpa , partly indicating the importance of the forbidden transitions .    in the case of cross sections",
    "averaged over the supernova neutrino flux for ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , the impact of the self - consistent and complete calculations including all relevant multipoles is explored in view of previous knowledge on neutrino induced reactions on a large - scale basis within the opb pool .",
    "figure  [ all_isotopes_t4_rqrpa_goriely.eps ] shows the ratio of the cross sections averaged over supernova neutrino flux of the present work and etfsi + cqrpa  @xcite model . in order to identify nuclei with pronounced discrepancies ,",
    "the following groups of nuclei are separately denoted in figure : stable nuclei , proton - rich nuclei defined by @xmath35 and neutron - rich nuclei with @xmath36 . for target nuclei where the cross sections are available for both models , the present large - scale calculations result mainly in systematically larger cross sections , for most of nuclei up to the factor of 4 , and for smaller number of nuclei up to the factor of 7 . however , for a limited set of medium mass nuclei the cross sections of this work are smaller than the etfsi+cqrpa ones , and these are mainly limited to neutron deficient nuclei in the range @xmath47 .",
    "the reason is the anomalous increase of the cross sections in the etfsi + cqrpa model , when moving along a particular isotope chain from @xmath48 nucleus toward proton rich nuclei ( see figs .",
    "[ csm_ni_isotopes_t4.eps ] and  [ csm_sn_isotopes_t4.eps ] ) .",
    "this behavior has not been observed in the present analysis .",
    "apart from this anomaly , one can observe systematic linear increase of the ratio of cross sections with the nuclear mass .",
    "as already discussed in the case of isotopic chains , in addition to the self - consistent implementation of the rnedf , the model employed in the present work includes a complete set of transition operators up to @xmath2 multipoles which enhance the overall cross sections . as shown in fig .",
    "[ all_isotopes_t4_rqrpa_goriely.eps ] the linear trend is particularly apparent in the case of neutron - rich nuclei ( @xmath36 ) , where the absolute values of the cross sections are relatively large in comparison to other nuclei under consideration .    to further explore the role of forbidden transitions in the opb pool , in fig .",
    "[ all_isotopes_t4_all_vs_gt_iar.eps ] we plot the ratio of cross sections taking into account all multipoles up to and including @xmath2 with cross sections that only include the contributions from the fermi and gamow - teller transitions .",
    "a trend very similar to the one in the previous figure appears , which indicates that the forbidden transitions contribute a larger fraction of the total cross sections in nuclei with higher mass . in heavier nuclei , and neutron - rich nuclei in particular",
    ", the difference between the proton and neutron numbers grows large , to the extent that in the very heavy nuclei neutrons occupy a full shell more above the protons .",
    "however , even in cases where there is not enough neutrons to occupy a full shell , additional neutrons move closer in energy to the orbits of the next shell , and therefore make the forbidden transitions less suppressed .",
    "the present analysis provides quantitative estimates for the mass dependence of the underlying structure in the neutrino - nucleus cross sections : in the mass region below @xmath49 the forbidden transitions contribute less than 10% of the total flux - averaged cross sections , but their contribution grows practically linear with mass and can provide up to 50% of the total cross section .",
    "therefore , in order to provide a realistic description of neutrino - nucleus reactions , as well as in the corresponding astrophysical applications , models must take into account more than the simplest fermi and gamow - teller terms .    in fig .",
    "[ all_isotopes_t4_rqrpa_langanke.eps ] the ratio of the averaged cross sections of this work and rpa ( ws + lm )  @xcite is shown .",
    "qualitative agreement between the two models is obtained and differences are within a factor of 2 .",
    "the ratio exhibits a mild mass dependence , i.e. the model based on rqrpa provides larger cross sections mainly for nuclei up to @xmath50 , while for heavier systems the cross sections are up to 50% smaller when compared to the ones previously reported with the rpa ( ws + lm ) model .",
    "these discrepancies occur for particular isotopic chains , however , there is no global systematic over- or underestimation of the cross - sections with respect to the rpa ( ws + lm ) approach , indicating that the deviations mainly originate from the different nuclear ground state and the residual interaction . the lack of a linear trend for neutron - rich nuclei ( in comparison to figs .  [ all_isotopes_t4_all_vs_gt_iar.eps ] and  [ all_isotopes_t4_rqrpa_goriely.eps ] ) , along with the fact that rpa ( ws+lm ) model includes all transitions up to and including @xmath43 points to the importance of the lowest forbidden transitions in the quantitative description of semileptonic processes in nuclei .",
    "the largest deviations appear for low mass proton - rich nuclei , where the @xmath26 reactions become suppressed and the absolute values of the cross sections are actually very low , making them very sensitive to the structural details of the ground state . in comparison to the rpa ( ws + lm ) model , the main advantage of the present work is implementation of fully self - consistent theory framework in description of nuclear sector in neutrino induced reactions . in this way predictions for the cross sections become feasible not only in the region of stable nuclei and those that are covered by the rpa ( ws+lm ) model , but also in the unknown regions of the nuclide map of relevance for the stellar processes and nucleosynthesis .",

    "several key features of the neutrino - nucleus cross sections have been illustrated for various supernova neutrino fluxes , indicating systematic increase of the averaged cross sections with increase of the number of neutrons in target nuclei as well as with temperature of the neutrino distribution . when going away from the valley of stability toward neutron - rich nuclei , the cross sections become considerably enhanced , while on the proton - rich side they are suppressed due to the blocking of orbitals available for neutrino induced transitions .",
    "the cross sections from the present analysis have been discussed in view of previously reported large scale calculations .",
    "current results are consistently higher than the results obtained using the etfsi + cqrpa model which includes only the fermi and the gamow - teller transitions . for lighter nuclei",
    "the rqrpa cross sections are approximately 50% larger , while for the heaviest nuclei studied they are up to 3 times larger .",
    "this enhancement originates in part from the forbidden transitions that are fully taken into account in the present work .",
    "we provide important quantitative insight into the underlying structure of the neutrino - nucleus cross sections throughout the nuclide map : in the mass region below @xmath49 the forbidden transitions contribute less than 10% of the total flux - averaged cross sections , but their contribution increases with mass and can provide up to 50% of the total cross section . for the limited set of nuclei , the differences between the present results and those of the rpa ( lm + ws ) model are constrained within a factor of three .",
    "there is no general trend in the cross sections ratio between the two models , and the differences arise mainly due to the different approach in the calculations of the nuclear ground state and the residual interaction in ( q)rpa .",
    "we have shown that the self - consistent calculations based on the rnedf , which take into account transitions of all relevant multipoles , result in differences in comparison to previously reported cross sections , and for a considerable number of target nuclei the cross sections are larger .",
    "therefore , revised calculations in modeling stellar evolution and r - process nucleosynthesis based on self - consistent descriptions of neutrino - induced reactions may allow an updated insight into the origin of elements in the universe .",
    "on the other hand , by employing various theory frameworks for neutrino - nucleus cross sections , one could estimate the uncertainties in the calculated element abundance patterns .",
    "the tables with the cross sections vs. neutrino energies of this work are available from the authors on request .",
