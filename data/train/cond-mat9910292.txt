    "in the recent years there has been much interest in various loop models .",
    "loop models are graphical models defined by drawing closed loops along the bonds of the underlying lattice .",
    "the loops may come in @xmath4 different flavours ( colours ) .",
    "no two loops can share a bond , while sharing a vertex is generally allowed .",
    "explicitly , the bond configurations are such that each vertex houses an even number  possibly zero  of bonds of each colour .",
    "each loop configuration is assigned a `` weight '' that depends on the number of participating vertices of each type . in the cases of interest",
    "these weights are actually positive hence , at least in finite volume , they define a _ probability measure _ on the set of all loop configurations . thus , for a finite lattice the loop partition function may be written as : @xmath5 with the sum running over all allowed loop configurations @xmath6 . here @xmath7 is the total number of participating bonds , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the number of vertices of type @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the corresponding vertex factor . where @xmath12 is a `` loop fugacity '' and @xmath13 is the number of loops of the @xmath10-th colour .",
    "although the objects @xmath13 are unambiguous when self - intersections are forbidden , in the general case they are not easily defined .",
    "nevertheless , the essence of such a term  at least in the case of integer @xmath12  is captured by the introduction of additional colours . ]",
    "this definition is slightly different from the one typically found in literature ( _ cf .",
    "_   refs .",
    "@xcite ) since it also includes the bond fugacity @xmath14 .",
    "although strictly speaking it is not needed ( since the bond fugacity can always be incorporated into the vertex factors ) , we find it convenient to keep @xmath14 as a separate parameter .",
    "we remark that by relabeling the empty bonds as an additional colour , these models may be formally regarded as `` fully packed '' .",
    "the reason loop models have been extensively studied is because they appear quite naturally as representations ( often approximate ) of various statistical - mechanical models .",
    "these include , among others , the ising model ( this approach dates back to kramers and wannier  @xcite and was later used to solve the model exactly  @xcite ) , the potts model ( polygon expansion  @xcite ) , @xmath15 spin models   @xcite , 1-d quantum spin models  @xcite , a supersymmetric spin chain  @xcite , the @xmath16-colouring problem  @xcite and polymer models  @xcite .",
    "here we consider the loop models explicitly related to the high - temperature expansions of the standard @xmath15 , corner - cubic ( aka diagonal - cubic ) and face - cubic spin models .",
    "this is , in fact , the same set of models that was treated in ref .",
    "however , in this paper , we provide a careful treatment of the large @xmath4 cases  and we treat the standard @xmath0-dimensional lattices . as a result , we arrive at quite unexpected results concerning the behaviour of these models in the high fugacity region .    in particular , despite the considerable attention",
    "the subject has received , most authors ( with certain exceptions , e.g.   @xcite ) chose to consider models where only loops of _ different _ colours are allowed to cross each other ( if at all ) . on the other hand spin systems ( in the high - temperature approximation )",
    "naturally generate self - intersecting loops . in order to avoid this issue ,",
    "an exorbitant amount of work has been done on lattices with coordination number @xmath17 ( e.g.  the honeycomb lattice ) , where loop intersections simply can not occur .",
    "overall this approach appears to be justified since one is usually interested in the critical properties of the underlying spin systems .",
    "indeed , consider the archetypal @xmath4-component spin system with @xmath18 and let us write @xmath19 .",
    "although as a spin system the right hand side makes strict sense only if @xmath20 ( the `` physical regime '' ) , the associated loop model turns out to be well defined for all @xmath21 . since the systems can be identified for @xmath22 it can be argued that the critical properties of the spin system and those of the loop model are the same and are independent of the underlying lattice .    notwithstanding , for @xmath3 any phase transition in the actual spin system is not anticipated until temperatures of order @xmath23 ( i.e. @xmath24 ) , which we note is well outside the physical regime of the loop model . at first glance",
    "this appears to be borne out : the natural parameter in the loop model ( as well as in the spin system ) seems to be @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the loop model could , in principle , capture the essential features of the spin system up to  and including  the critical point .",
    "we have found such a picture to be overly optimistic . indeed , depending on the specific details , e.g.  the lattice structure",
    ", there may be a phase transition in the region @xmath26 ( specifically , @xmath27 ) , well outside the physical regime but well before the validity of the approximation was supposed to break down .",
    "furthermore , it would seem that both the temperature scale and the nature of the transition ( not to mention the existence of the transition ) depend on such details .",
    "finally , we shall demonstrate that in contrast to their spin system counterparts , the large-@xmath4 models have _ no _ phase transition  for any value of bond fugacity  associated with the formation of large loops ( i.e.   divergent loop correlations ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : models ] is dedicated to the description of the spin models and their connection to the loop models .",
    "specific results for those models with the two - dimensional spin variable ( @xmath1 ) are presented in section  [ sec : n=2 ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : n_large ] contains the discussion of reflection positivity as well as some results concerning phase transitions in the large @xmath4 case .",
    "let us start by considering the @xmath15 model on some finite lattice @xmath28 _ defined _ by the following partition function : @xmath29 with @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 denoting normalised summation ( integration ) over all possible spin configurations .",
    "the corresponding loop model is readily obtained along the lines of a typical `` high - temperature '' expansion .",
    "we write @xmath33 and define @xmath4 different colours ( each associated with a coordinate direction of the @xmath15-spins ) . expanding the product",
    ", we have @xmath4 choices for each bond plus a possibility of a vacant bond .",
    "thus , various terms are represented by @xmath4-coloured bond configurations : @xmath34 with @xmath35 denoting those bonds where the term @xmath36 has been selected .",
    "clearly , the various @xmath35 s are pairwise ( bond ) disjoint .",
    "thus , for each @xmath37 we obtain the weight @xmath38 on the basis of elementary symmetry considerations it is clear that @xmath39 if and only if each vertex houses an even number ( which could be zero ) of bonds of each colour .",
    "once this constraint is satisfied , we get an overall factor of @xmath40  with @xmath41 being the total number of participating bonds  times the product of the _ vertex factors _ obtained by performing the appropriate @xmath15 integrals . the details and results of these calculations are presented in appendix  [ sec : kmf ] . in general",
    ", it is seen that the vertex factors depend only on the number of participating colours and the number of bonds of each colour emanating from a given vertex , i.e.  not on the particular colours that were involved nor on the directions of these bonds .    in the case of a square lattice ( @xmath2 ) we have only three main types of ( non - empty ) vertices : those where two bonds of the same colour join together , those with two pairs of bonds of two different colours and those with four bonds of the same colour .",
    "these have weights of @xmath23 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 correspondingly .",
    "rescaling the bond fugacity from @xmath44 to @xmath45 we arrive at the vertex weights @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the factor of 3 relating @xmath49 to @xmath50 has an interesting interpretation ( which , as shown in appendix  [ sec : kmf ] , turns out to be quite general ) .",
    "indeed , each vertex of the third type may be decomposed into three different vertices as shown in fig .",
    "[ o(n)_vertices ] .",
    "each of the new vertices is now assigned equal weight , which is also that of @xmath49 .",
    "we thus split each @xmath37 into @xmath51 different graphs ",
    "each of equal weight  in which every vertex with four bonds now provides explicit instructions relating outgoing and incoming directions of an individual walk .        hence in every such graph ( now defined with the walking instructions encoded at every vertex ) the individual loops are well defined .",
    "furthermore , changing the colour of any loop does not change the weight of the graph .",
    "thus we may write @xmath52 where the summation now takes place over all configurations @xmath53 of colourless loop graphs in which every vertex housing four bonds is resolved by `` walking instructions '' , and @xmath54 is the number of such loops ( being now defined completely unambiguously ) .",
    "in addition to the advantages of a manifestly colourless expression , the above permits continuation to non - integer @xmath4 .",
    "we conclude this subsection with the following series of remarks and observations .    *",
    "as shown in appendix  [ sec : kmf ] , such vertex decomposition works , in fact , for an arbitrary lattice in an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions ( with the proper weights for vertices housing 6 , 8 , etc .",
    "bonds ) . *",
    "notice that only @xmath20 region of the parameter space is `` physical '' ( in a sense of the underlying hamiltonian : @xmath55 $ ] ) , while for @xmath56 one presumes , no spin hamiltonian can be written at all .",
    "the corresponding loop model , however , makes perfect sense in the entire parameter space . *",
    "if we consider a 2d xy model ( @xmath1 ) , we notice that the factor @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ o(n)_loops ] ) can be obtained by assigning directions to the colourless loops .",
    "the above decomposition of type 3 vertices makes this procedure unambiguous . having done that , we can turn this model into a random surface model by assigning heights to the plaquettes in such a way that a plaquette to the right of a directed bond is always one step higher than the plaquette to the left .",
    "not surprisingly , this random surface model turns out to be identical to the one obtained by the standard means of fourier - transforming the original weights in eq .",
    "( [ o(n)_part ] ) ( _ cf",
    ". _   refs .",
    "@xcite ) . *",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that in the fully packed limit @xmath58 , the @xmath1 loop model on the square lattice ( with the colour degrees of freedom being replaced by assigning directions to the loops ) turns out to be nothing but the square ice model ( i.e. the six - vertex model with all six weights being equal  see ref .",
    "@xcite for a definition of this model ) .",
    "the mapping between the vertices of these models is shown in fig .",
    "[ 6-vertex ] .",
    "we remark that the perspective of the ice model ( and , for that matter , other six - vertex models ) as a two colour loop model provides additional flexibility in the analysis of these systems .",
    "these issues will be pursued in a future publication .",

    "( [ o(n)_part ] ) ) : @xmath59 \\label{corner_part}\\ ] ] with @xmath60 . for small values of @xmath21",
    "this model may be viewed as a high - temperature limit of a corner - cubic model .",
    "indeed , it describes an interaction of the type in eq .",

    "we can choose to associate the weight of @xmath63 with each bond , thus making all vertex weights @xmath11 to be equal to unity .",
    "in other words , the resulting loops in this model do not interact with each other via vertices ( there is still a hard core bond repulsion , however ) .",

    "\\label{face - cubic}\\ ] ] here @xmath66 , and for a given site @xmath10 exactly one of @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) has a non - zero value .",
    "in fact , one may think of @xmath69 s as components of an @xmath4-dimensional unit vector that is only allowed to point along the coordinate axes ( or from the centre to the faces of an @xmath4-dimensional hypercube - thus the name face - cubic ) .",
    "while the corner - cubic model described earlier had @xmath70 degrees of freedom per site ( the number of corners of a hypercube ) , the present model has only @xmath71 such degrees of freedom ( the number of faces ) .    once again , the corresponding loop model is obtained by performing multiplication in eq .",
    "( [ face - cubic ] ) and then summing the resulting terms over all possible values of @xmath69 s .",
    "but since for each site @xmath10 only one of the spin components @xmath72 at a time , we notice that no terms that mix different @xmath73 s are allowed . in terms of resulting loops",
    "this means hard - core repulsion of different colours : only loops of the same colour can share a vertex .",
    "the vertex factors are now : zero for any vertex with multiple colours and @xmath23 for vertices with two or more bonds of the same colour ; the bond fugacity is given by @xmath74 .",
    "in this section we shall restrict our attention to the models with cubic symmetries .",
    "firstly , let us slightly change the notations for convenience : let @xmath75 and @xmath76 for the corner - cubic , while @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the face - cubic model .",
    "the corresponding partition functions are then written as @xmath79 \\label{cc2}\\ ] ] and @xmath80\\ , .",
    "\\label{fc2}\\ ] ]    while we have seen that the loop models generated by these partition functions are very different , the spin models themselves turn out to be identical . indeed , eq .  ( [ fc2 ] )",
    "is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ cc2 ] ) by the following transformation : @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "this is equivalent to a @xmath83 rotation in the spin space ( along with a @xmath84 rescaling ) and is very specific to the @xmath1 case . in turn , both models are equivalent to the ashkin  teller model  @xcite with a particular choice of parameters that will be detailed in section  [ sec : at_duality ] .",
    "the two - colour loop models generated by eq .",
    "( [ cc2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ fc2 ] ) are given by the following sets of parameters in eq .",
    "( [ part ] ) : @xmath85 , with all vertices having weight one , and @xmath44 , with all multi - colour vertices given weight zero and all other non - empty vertices given weight one - half respectively .",
    "turning our attention to the particular case of two spatial dimensions , we remark that in the former model one can sum over all possible colourings to obtain the following result for the partition function : @xmath86 with @xmath87 being the total number of occupied ( colourless ) bonds and @xmath88 being the total number of _ faces _ in the clusters they form .",
    "the number of faces is the minimum number of bonds that one must remove in order for the remaining clusters to be tree - like .",
    "for example , the cluster in fig .",
    "[ cross - cluster ] has five _ faces _ , while it can at most consist of four _ loops_. curiously enough , this result appears to have no simple generalisation for @xmath89 .",
    "it appears that the two - dimensional loop model derived from the corner - cubic model can not be mapped directly onto a random surface model .",
    "however , the other loop representation ( the one obtained via expansion of the face - cubic model ) does correspond to a random surface model .",
    "indeed , consider the following `` recipe '' : take a loop configuration generated by a particular term in the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ fc2 ] ) .",
    "let red be the colour of loops originating from @xmath69 s , while blue corresponds to @xmath90 s .",
    "take all plaquettes at the outermost region to be at height zero ( these plaquettes are said to form a substrate ) .",
    "on this substrate we have clusters of loops .",
    "the outermost boundaries of these clusters are themselves closed loops .",
    "the plaquettes immediately adjacent to these boundaries are assigned the hight of @xmath91 if the loop forming a boundary is red , or @xmath92 if it is blue .",
    "these plaquettes , along with any other plaquette accessible from them without crossing coloured bonds are said to form a plateau and thus have the same height .",
    "inside such a plateau region there may be other loop clusters , that may or may not touch the boundary of a plateau ( only corners are allowed to touch , since no bond sharing between the loops is possible ) .",
    "every such cluster is now treated in the same way : its boundary defines the `` secondary '' plateau with the height being that of the `` primary '' plateau @xmath93 depending on the colour of the boundary .",
    "this procedure is repeated until all plaquettes are assigned their heights . as an example , consider the cluster in fig .",
    "[ cross - cluster](a ) , which may now only consist of the bonds of a single colour .",
    "if this were a red cluster , the heights would be @xmath91 for the plaquettes 1 - 4 and @xmath94 for the plaquette 5 .",
    "in fact , this description is essentially identical to that given in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of wetting transition with the only difference that we allow for two - coloured clusters instead of single - coloured , and therefore the heights in our case may be both positive and negative .",
    "firstly , due to an irreducible four - leg vertex factor , it can not be described by a nearest - neighbour hamiltonian ( i.e. a hamiltonian that depends only on the height difference of neighbouring plaquettes ) .",
    "secondly , since no directions are assigned to the loops separating the plateaux , there is no way of deciding on the _ sign _ of their relative height difference without going through the necessary construction steps starting from the _ outside_. by contrast , the @xmath95-related random surface model can be constructed starting from _ any _ plaquette  a particular choice simply determines the overall additive constant . in this sense",
    "the mapping between the present random surface and the loop model is _",
    "nonlocal_. ]    the important feature of this random surface model is that it must have a phase transition whenever the underlying ashkin  teller model undergoes a transition .",
    "let us derive yet another graphical representation for the @xmath1 ( ashkin  teller ) model considered in the previous section , this time it will be a _ random cluster _ representation closely resembling the fk representation for the potts model .",
    "we start from eq .",
    "( [ corner_part ] ) ( with @xmath1 ) , and with the help of the identity @xmath96 rewrite it as follows : @xmath97 \\label{at_part}\\ ] ] with @xmath98 .",
    "the random cluster representation is generated by evaluating the product over all bonds in eq .",
    "( [ at_part ] ) and then summing over the possible values of @xmath99 s and @xmath100 s .",
    "if we think of the bonds originating from the @xmath99 variables as green ( g ) , and the bonds originating from the @xmath100 variables as orange ( o ) , then each of the resulting terms in the partition function can be graphically represented as a collection of green and orange clusters as well as empty sites .",
    "the clusters of different colours may share sites , but not bonds . denoting the configurations of green and orange bonds as @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively , we can then write the partition function as @xmath103 with @xmath104 being the total number of bonds ( of a specified colour ) , and @xmath105 being the number of corresponding connected components .",
    "the rule for counting the connected components is as follows : every site that is not a part of a green cluster is considered to be a separate connected component for the purposes of @xmath106 , even if this site is a part of an orange cluster , and vise versa . in particular , the quantities @xmath107 and @xmath108 are to be interpreted exactly as in the usual random cluster models .      the duality relations for such random cluster representation of the standard at model in two dimensions were established in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "firstly , let us write the generic at hamiltonian as @xmath110 .",
    "\\label{at_hamlt}\\ ] ]    the graphical representation for the partition function is then obtained along the lines of the previous section .",
    "the only difference is that this time double - coloured ( i.e. green and orange at the same time ) bonds are also allowed .",
    "the graphical weight of a given bond configuration @xmath111 is @xmath112 where @xmath113 observe that eq .",
    "( [ at_fk ] ) describes a particular case of this model provided that @xmath114 while @xmath115 .",
    "[ sec : at_duality ]    the dual model is obtained by placing orange bonds between the sites of a dual lattice every time when it does not cross a green bond of the original lattice .",
    "correspondingly , the green bonds on the dual lattice are dual to the original orange bonds .",
    "the duality relations are given by : @xmath116 and the model becomes self - dual when @xmath117 .",
    "it is therefore suggestive that our model becomes self - dual at @xmath109 ( or @xmath118 ) . in order to show that it is indeed _ exactly _ self - dual",
    ", we shall perform the above duality transformation to the orange bonds only ( @xmath119 ) , leaving the green bonds intact .",
    "this results in having green bonds on both original and the dual lattices .",
    "the green bonds on the dual lattice can be then split into those traversal to the original green bonds and those traversal to the previously vacant bonds , or symbolically @xmath120 . here",
    "@xmath121 is the configuration of ( green ) bonds _ dual _ to the orange bonds while @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the configurations of bonds _ transversal _ to the original green and vacant bonds correspondingly .",
    "the corresponding weight is now given by : @xmath124 we now observe that @xmath125 , and also that @xmath126 as @xmath127 ( the original random cluster model becomes fully packed according to eq .",
    "( [ at_fk ] ) ) .",
    "then the weight in this limit becomes simply @xmath128    the model described by such weights is manifestly self - dual since @xmath129 and @xmath130 as @xmath127 , and there is a symmetry between the green and the orange bonds .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that a phase transition occurs exactly at the self - dual point .",
    "although this is plausible , it is not the only possibility . in particular , there may be a phase transition at some @xmath131 .",
    "however , we can say the following : if at @xmath132 there is no magnetisation ( i.e. percolation of green or orange bonds ) then the theorem proved by two of us  @xcite applies ; @xmath132 is a critical point in the sense of infinite correlation length and infinite susceptibility .",
    "the only other possibility is positive magnetisation at @xmath132 which implies a magnetic transition  which could be continuous or first order  at some @xmath133 .",
    "( in particular , this is shown to happen , with a first order transition for the large-@xmath16 versions of these models  @xcite ) .",
    "although we find these alternative scenarios unlikely , we have , in any case , established the existence of a transition in this model for some value of @xmath21 between zero and one .",
    "as mentioned above , in our opinion the most likely scenario is that a phase transition occurs precisely at @xmath132 .",
    "the interesting question then is that of the universality class . without any supporting mathematical statements",
    ", we suggest that _ at _ this point our model behaves similarly to the 4-state potts ferromagnet at its critical point . in order to substantiate this claim ,",
    "let us first recall the random cluster representation for a @xmath16-state potts model : @xmath134 for @xmath135 this model is universally accepted to have a continuous transition at the self - dual point @xmath136 .",
    "thus for the @xmath137 model at the self - dual point we have @xmath138 on the other hand , we can use eq .",
    "( [ limiting_weight ] ) to rewrite the partition function of our model at @xmath132 as follows : @xmath139 the difference between the two models is in the last factor of @xmath140 in eq .",
    "( [ stupid ] ) .",
    "it is , however , reasonable to speculate that it can be neglected . indeed , on average @xmath141 , and",
    "therefore one would expect the typical value of the difference @xmath142 to be sublinear in the system size .",
    "by contrast , the individual terms @xmath143 and @xmath144 indeed scale linearly with the size of the system so this correction may be `` unimportant '' .",
    "this , however , does not mean that the two models approach the self - dual point in a similar fashion .",
    "in other words , we expect the exponents associated with the critical point itself ( such as @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) of the two models to be the same , while this needs not be true for the exponents associated with the _ approach _ to the critical point ( such as @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) .",
    "in fact , the @xmath132 point of our model may well be an edge of a critical kosterlitz - thouless phase in which case the approach exponents would take on extreme values ( zero or infinity ) .",

    "throwing in a combinatoric factor for the placement of the @xmath277 bonds and the fact that there can not conceivably be more than @xmath278 loops to colour we arrive at @xmath279 where @xmath280 is defined as follows : for @xmath277 bonds , consider their placement on the lattice chosen so as to maximise the number of ways in which the resulting ( colourless ) graph can be decomposed into distinct loops .",

    "the type of these transitions happens to be sensitive to the lattice structure and the vertex factors that correspond to loop intersections .",
    "this leads to a variety of critical phenomena which has not been observed in the case of a honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "we shall consider the case of all vertex factors being positive and uniformly bounded .",
    "let the number of colours @xmath4 be very large and consider the high fugacity limit of @xmath58 .",
    "the model becomes fully - packed in this limit , i.e. every bond is occupied .",
    "but since @xmath4 is large , according to the estimates of the previous subsection the partition function is dominated by configurations in which there are as many loops as possible . in two dimensions ,",
    "it is clear that these `` maximum entropy states '' break the translational symmetry : the loops of different colours may run around either odd or even plaquettes of the lattice .",
    "( we remark that in @xmath243 , the situation is considerably more complicated and is currently under study . )    on the other hand , if the bond fugacity is low , the system must be translationally invariant .",
    "therefore one would anticipate that at some large but finite value of @xmath14 a translational symmetry - breaking transition takes place . due to a doubly positionally degenerate nature of the resulting high - density state",

    ", it appears to be very similar to the transition in the ising antiferromagnet .",
    "let us now turn to the rigorous arguments supporting this qualitative picture .",

    "( [ eq : xi_bound ] ) .",
    "similarly , in @xmath305 half the bonds are used ( resulting in a factor of @xmath219 ) and there are no more than @xmath216 loops .",
    "we get @xmath312^n y(n)\\ ] ]  essentially the square root of the above .    in order to show that there is translation invariance it is sufficient to establish the following :",
    "let @xmath313 and @xmath314 denote local events , let @xmath315 be the translation operator to the point @xmath191 and let @xmath316 denote any unit vector .",
    "then we must show that for all @xmath317 with @xmath318 large the probabilities of @xmath319 and @xmath320 are essentially the same .",
    "we note that either the supports of @xmath313 and @xmath321 are attached by a @xmath322-connected path of sites of type @xmath305 and @xmath306 , or they are separated by a connected circuit of cites of type @xmath304 .",
    "( two sites are considered @xmath322-connected if they share the same plaquette . ) however , in case the support of a is surrounded by a connected circuit of empty sites , it is clear that for any @xmath316 , @xmath313 and @xmath323 have the same probability .",
    "thus we arrive at @xmath324 where @xmath325 is the event that there is a @xmath322-connected path of non-@xmath301 sites between the support of a and that of @xmath321 .",
    "now , provided @xmath326 is small , @xmath327 with @xmath328 for some constant @xmath147 .",
    "thence translation invariance ( among the states that emerge from the torus ) is established .",
    "let us now turn attention to the opposite limit , namely @xmath329 .",
    "we claim that with high probability the plaquettes on the lattice are of one of the two types : they are either surrounded by four bonds of the same colour , or by bonds of four different colours .",
    "we will again define site events representative of the two purported ground states .",
    "if a site is on the even sublattice , we say it is of the a - type if it has four bonds of two different colours , one colour occupying the positive @xmath330 and @xmath331 directions and the other , the negative @xmath330 and @xmath331 directions .",
    "the odd site of the a - type is defined as the mirror reflection of an even a - type site .",
    "a site is said to be of b - type if the rles of the even and the odd sublattices are reversed  see fig .",

    "there are three choices for such bad sites , namely housing no bonds , only two bonds and a `` + '' configuration in which the @xmath330 and @xmath332 directions have the same colour and similarly for the @xmath333 directions .",
    "the first two are the old @xmath301 and @xmath302 from the preceding portion of this proof , while the constrained partition function for the latter event , denoted ( for the lack of better notations ) by @xmath334 can be bounded by @xmath335 on the other hand , we can always estimate @xmath224 from below by @xmath336 ^ 2n$ ] as discussed previously .",
    "thus we have ( as @xmath337 )    [ eq : mu_estimates ] @xmath338    thus almost all sites are either a - type or b - type . however , there is no constraint that a and b sites can not be neighbours .",
    "but , as we show below , this possibility is also suppressed for @xmath3 .",
    "firstly , let us notice that the reflections through bonds map the even into the odd sites ( and vice versa ) . by definition ,",
    "the a - even and a - odd events are mirror images , and similarly for b. thus , under multiple reflections , a - sites map to a - sites and b s to b s . hence ,",
    "if ( a - b ) is the event that the origin is of the a - type and its right nearest neighbour is of the b - type , we have @xmath339 where @xmath340 is the partition function constrained according to the pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ a - b_pattern ] .",
    "are the even sites of the a - type etc .",
    "the zigzag lines that form loops wrapping the torus and separating the columns of a- and b - sites are shown black.,width=264 ]    now , the interior of the a or b columns still consists of the four - bond loops  just as a pure a or pure b - type tiling would .",
    "however , as is easily seen in fig .",
    "[ a - b_pattern ] , a boundary between the columns is formed by a zigzag line of a single colour running around the torus . thus we arrive at @xmath341 and hence , in the large @xmath237 limit , @xmath342 .",
    "the rest of the proof follows easily : a connected cluster of a - type sites has , on its boundary a `` bad '' site or an a - b pair ; similarly for the clusters of b - sites .",
    "thus , if @xmath343 and @xmath4 are large enough , the possibility that any given site is isolated from the origin is small .",
    "thence , given that the origin is of the a - type  which has probability very near one half  the population of b - type sites is small and vice versa .",
    "evidently , there are two states , one with an abundance of a - sites and the other with an abundance of b s .",
    "it is not hard to see that in these two states , translation symmetry is broken  both are dominated by the appropriate staggered patterns .",
    "so far we have succeeded in proving the following general statements :    * a generic multi - coloured loop model with _ all _ vertex factors @xmath344 uniformly bounded from above and below does not have a phase transition corresponding to the divergence of the loop size in _ any _ dimension _ provided _ that the number of colours @xmath4 is sufficiently large . * in two dimensions these models undergo a different phase transition , presumably of the ising type , that is associated with breaking the _ translational _ symmetry . while the `` ground states '' ( the states at @xmath345 ) of the system are _ not _ translationally invariant , their degeneracy appears to grow very fast with @xmath0 , and it is not obvious that the resulting `` entropy '' will not destroy the transition at any finite value of @xmath14 . ] .",
    "while the examples of the models that have been considered in this paper all have their vertex factors independent of the particular arrangements of different colours entering the vertex , all these results remain valid even if this is not the case as long as all different vertex factors are still reflection - symmetric and bounded from above and below by some positive numbers .    a clear example of a model that does not follow this rule is the loop model derived from the face - cubic spin model in section  [ sec : face - cubic ] .",
    "here the bonds of different colours are simply not allowed to share a vertex , making the corresponding vertex factor vanish .",
    "it is clear that as the bond fugacity @xmath14 increases , the system will have a phase transition ( possibly of the first order ) associated with breaking the _ colour _ symmetry .",
    "indeed , the only way to `` pack '' more bonds into the system is to force all of them to be of the same colour .",
    "this transition is very similar to the widom - rowlinson transition .",
    "another interesting observation can be made about the two - dimensional loop model with all two- and four - leg vertices having the same weight ( this is the model originating from the corner - cubic spin model  see section  [ sec : corner - cubic ] ) . comparing the states of the system at @xmath345 when all bonds are occupied ( the fully packed limit ) , and at @xmath346 when no additional weight is associated with placing extra loops",
    ", we conclude that the @xmath347-coloured model at @xmath345 is identical to the @xmath4-coloured model at @xmath346 .",
    "indeed , one should simply consider the vacant bonds at @xmath346 as being coloured grey to turn the @xmath4-coloured loop system into a fully - packed @xmath347-coloured system .    now",
    "start with the large enough @xmath4 at @xmath345 .",
    "the result of section  [ sec : transl_sym ] guarantees the existence of a broken translational symmetry in this case . by the argument presented here",
    "this means the existence of a broken symmetry in @xmath348-coloured , @xmath346 case .",
    "now let us continuously increase the value of the bond fugacity in this @xmath348-coloured model .",
    "as @xmath14 grows , there are only two possible scenarios : the broken translational symmetry is either lost via a phase transition or is retained all the way to @xmath345 .",
    "the former case corresponds to the _ intermediate _ symmetry - broken phase surrounded by the phase transitions at @xmath349 and @xmath350 .",
    "if the latter scenario is realised , then go to @xmath345 and repeat the process of mapping it onto a lower @xmath4 model .",
    "notice that this latter scenario can not continue all the way to @xmath351 because the @xmath351 , @xmath346 case is nothing but a loop representation for the ising magnet at @xmath352 which does not have broken translational symmetry .",
    "`` high temperature '' expansion are also the domain walls of the ising model on the dual lattice at @xmath353 .",
    "these dual spins are assigned their values independently with probability @xmath354 , and the contours separating regions of opposite type are manifestly translation invariant . ]",
    "therefore one _ must _ find an intermediate phase at some not very large value of @xmath4 ( although we can not rule out a possibility of it being just the point @xmath346 ) .    from the above",
    "we also learn that the @xmath1 ( ashkin  teller - like ) model is _ not _ critical in its fully - packed limit ( since it is just the @xmath352 ising model ) . on the other hand the @xmath95 loop model discussed in section  [ sec : on ] _ is _ critical in this limit ( it maps onto the square ice model ) .",
    "but the only difference between the two is the factor of 3 in the same - colour four - leg vertex factor .    on the basis of this observation ( along with the first two remarks of this section )",
    "we reiterate that the vertex factors and lattice details are often important for determining the phase diagram of a particular model .",
    "in this appendix we present the calculation of the generic vertex factor appearing in the loop expansion of the @xmath15-type model featured in [ sec : on ] .",
    "as it turns out , this calculation is independent of the lattice details ( such as the dimensionality or coordination number ) which is reflected in our notation .",
    "thus let @xmath355 denote the @xmath4-dimensional solid angle and let @xmath356 denote the components of a @xmath4-dimensional unit vector . since we only consider the spin at one particular site , the actual site index is conveniently dropped for now .",
    "the vertex factor we need to calculate is @xmath357 where @xmath358^{-1 } } $ ] is the total solid angle and @xmath359 is the haar measure .",
    "the object @xmath360 is , of course , the `` vertex factor '' originating from @xmath361 terms from the first component , ",
    "@xmath362 terms from the @xmath4-th component associated with these numbers of these types of bonds entering into a vertex .",
    "[ proposition_a1 ] let @xmath363  which is equal to @xmath364  denote the number of different ways of dividing @xmath365 objects into @xmath366 distinct pairs .",
    "then @xmath367 where @xmath368 and @xmath369    the calculation of the value for @xmath360 has appeared before , _ cf . _",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "however , the interpretation that emerges from this formula has , to our knowledge , not been discussed previously ( _ cf . _  the remark following the proof ) .",
    "the proof boils down to the calculation of the above integral .",
    "we write @xmath370 where @xmath371 .",
    "also , @xmath372 where @xmath373 is an @xmath374-dimensional unit vector . finally , we note the fact that @xmath375        as a consequence of the expression  ( [ eq : proposition_a1 ] ) we may decompose the coloured bond configurations to obtain a colourless loop model ( which generalises the result of eq .",
    "( [ o(n)_loops ] ) obtained for the square lattice ) .",
    "in particular , at each vertex we have a factor which depends only on the total number of bonds entering the vertex ( and the dimensionality of the spin @xmath4 ) times the number of ways that the bonds of the various colours can be paired . by choosing a particular pairing scheme at each vertex , the bond configuration breaks , unambiguously , into a collection of",
    "self - returning walks ( loops ) .",
    "configurations with the same set of loops  that is to say the same set of bonds and the same pairing schemes ( walking instructions ) at each vertex  but which differ in the colours of the loops are seen to have identical weights .",
    "thus we consider configurations @xmath53 of loops ( bonds + walking instructions ) and the partition function becomes the analog of the expression [ o(n)_loops ] : @xmath380 with @xmath381 being the factor for a vertex with @xmath382 bonds given by @xmath383    we observe that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ o(n)_loops_gen ] ) provides a well defined model for all @xmath4 and can be continued  essentially with no ambiguity  to non - integer values . as usual , we may _ define _ correlation functions via loop probabilities or be content with the numerators containing strings divided by denominators without .    in the previous discussions of these issues ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) the goal has been to derive the self - avoiding walk as the @xmath384 limit of the @xmath15 models . thus the vertex weights themselves get continued without reference to intermediate models .",
    "( and indeed , the self - avoiding walk does emerge as @xmath385 . ) although we have only treated the case where the original spin models were defined by @xmath386 as opposed to @xmath387  we claim that the latter case also leads to graphical models that are well defined for non - integer @xmath4 .",
    "( the derivation is somewhat intricate and will eventually appear in a future publication .",
    ") however , we remark that in either case , the @xmath384 limit is , in this context , quite simple to understand .",
