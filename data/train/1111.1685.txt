    "@xcite the topological classification of the ground states of bulk band insulators or superconductors is a useful approach for the elucidation of low energy properties of the topological phases .",
    "the fundamental consequence of this classification is the _ bulk - boundary correspondence _ ; i.e. there exist the topologically protected gapless states on a boundary surface which separates two systems belonging to different topological classes.@xcite recently , teo and kane proposed the generalization of this topological classification to arbitrary topological defects such as line defects and point defects in insulators and superconductors.@xcite it was suggested that the existence of gapless modes in defects follows from topologically nontrivial ground states of hamiltonians which vary with material parameters characterizing the defects .",
    "the teo - kane theory was successfully applied to various kinds of heterostructure junction systems , describing correctly low energy gapless modes which appear at junctions . a basic idea of teo - kane theory is an `` adiabatic deformation '' .",
    "the interface structure with a finite energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state can be deformed smoothly into the hamiltonian varies slowly in real space without closing the energy gap .",
    "then , dealing with the spatial coordinates @xmath0 which parametrize defects as adiabatic parameters , one can introduce the adiabatic hamiltonian @xmath1 , which can be used for the argument on topological properties of defects .",
    "although the underlying idea is quite general , and independent of approximation schemes of calculations , a simple method for implementing this idea is to apply the semi - classical approximation to such a slowly varying hamiltonian , and to treat the spatial coordinate @xmath0 and the momentum @xmath2 as independent variables .",
    "in fact , this approach was adopted for the argument on the topological insulator - antiferromagnet junction in ref.@xcite .",
    "the semi - classical approach is particularly useful when the spatial variation of material parameters raised by defects is sufficiently slow . in the case of line defects with broken time reversal symmetry , which may be raised by the topological insulator - magnet junctions , the topological invariant within a semi - classical approximation",
    "can be represented by the winding number of the axion @xmath3-term @xcite which characterizes the topological structures of band insulators in bulk regimes . as long as the spatial variation of material parameters in the vicinity of defects is sufficiently slow",
    ", we can calculate the @xmath3-term by using the semi - classical approach .",
    "@xcite    however , in some cases , a semi - classical approximation fails to give the correct energy spectrum of spatially inhomogeneous systems .",
    "for instance , in the case of a topological insulator - ferromagnet heterostructure junction , which is particularly important for the application to the quantum hall effect , a semi - classical approximation which neglects quantum corrections leads to the closing of an energy gap at the interface between the topological insulator and the ferromagnet .",
    "since the full quantum energy spectrum of this system has an energy gap , the gap - closing is a spurious effect raised by the semiclassical approximation . because of the gap - closing",
    ", we can not evaluate the topological invariant , and hence , the semiclassical approach for the topological classification of defects is flawed .",
    "motivated by the above consideration , we propose a full quantum formulation for the topological invariant characterizing line defects in three - dimensional insulators with no symmetry exploiting the green s function method , but , without using both adiabatic deformation and semi - classical approximation . on the basis of the full quantum treatment , we demonstrate the existence of a nontrivial topological invariant in the topological insulator - ferromagnet tri - junction systems of which the energy gap is closed within the semi - classical approximation .    the organization of this paper is as follows : in sec.[sec2 ] , we briefly review the teo - kane classification scheme , particularly focusing on the topological invariant for line defects in a three - dimensional insulator .",
    "we also demonstrate that in a topological insulator - ferromagnet heterostructure system a semi - classical approximation neglecting quantum corrections to the energy spectrum fails to capture the correct topological features of the system . in sec.[sec3 ] , we present the full quantum construction of the topological invariant for line defects with broken time - reversal symmetry . in sec.[sec4 ] and sec.[sec5 ] , we apply our approach to the topological insulator - ferromagnet heterostructure system . for this purpose",
    ", we use an exactly solvable model of the heterostructure .",

    ". then the nonzero winding number of @xmath3 corresponds to the existence of gapless modes .",
    "the @xmath3-term is the same as the axion field in the context of the axion electrodynamics describing the electromagnetic property of the topological insulators.@xcite    the above argument is based on a semi - classical approach because quantum corrections to the energy spectrum from spatial inhomogeneities are neglected .",
    "hence it is not guaranteed that eq.(1 ) can describe the existence of gapless modes in cases where the semi - classical approximation fails .",
