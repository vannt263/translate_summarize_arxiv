    "in the late 1970s , @xcite and @xcite conducted physical experiments that investigated the evolution of nonlinear wave trains on deep water .",
    "they found that the growth of the benjamin - feir instability is followed by a shift in the spectral peak to a frequency closer to zero .",
    "subsequent experiments , including those in @xcite and @xcite , demonstrated that the amplitude of the lower sideband grows and eventually overtakes that of the carrier wave .",
    "these later experimental studies focused on waves with larger steepness and involved wave breaking .",
    "more recently , @xcite conducted similar experiments without wave breaking or wind .",
    "they found that frequency downshifting ( fd ) is not observed ( in their tank ) if the waves have `` small or moderate '' amplitudes and that fd is observed if the amplitude of the carrier wave is `` large '' or if the sideband perturbations are `` large enough . ''",
    "they also found that if fd occurs then ( i ) the spectral mean ( defined below ) decreases monotonically in time and ( ii ) fd occurs in the higher harmonics before it occurs in the fundamental .",
    "the goal of the current work is to provide a mathematical justification for fd that does not rely on wind or wave breaking .",
    "readers interested in wind and wave - breaking justifications for fd are referred to  @xcite .",
    "there are two quantities that are commonly used to quantify frequency downshifting : the spectral peak and the spectral mean .",
    "the spectral peak , @xmath0 , is defined to be the wave number corresponding to the fourier mode with largest magnitude .",
    "the spectral mean , @xmath1 , is defined by @xmath2 where @xmath3 , the `` mass , '' and @xmath4 , the `` linear momentum , '' are defined by    @xmath5    @xmath6    [ mp ]    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the free surface displacement and period of the solution / wave train respectively .",
    "we note that while some studies use @xmath4 by itself as a measure of fd , we focus on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite derived the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) from the euler equations as a model for the evolution of the envelope of a nearly monochromatic wave group .",
    "nls preserves the spectral mean , so it can not be used to model fd .",
    "@xcite carried out the nls perturbation analysis one order higher to obtain what is now known as the dysthe system . @xcite",
    "numerically solved nls and the dysthe system and established that the dysthe system more accurately predicts the evolution of mildly sloped , narrow - banded , weakly nonlinear waves over longer time periods than does nls .",
    "they also found that dissipative generalizations of the dysthe system are required to model waves of moderate steepness over long distances .",
    "finally , their numerical studies showed that the dysthe system did not lead to a permanent fd even though the dysthe system does not preserve the spectral mean . @xcite",
    "established that the dissipative nls equation accurately modeled the evolution of waves trains in which no fd occurred and that it can not model fd because it preserves the spectral mean .",
    "the dissipative nls equation was used as an ad - hoc model without formal justification until @xcite derived it from a weakly viscous generalization of the euler equations .",
    "the first step in the current work is to carry out the dysthe perturbation analysis starting from the @xcite weakly viscous generalization of the euler equations in order to derive a new system which we call the viscous dysthe system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ derivation ] contains the derivation of the viscous dysthe system .",
    "section [ properties ] contains a summary of the main properties of this new equation .",
    "section [ experiments ] contains comparisons of viscous dysthe predictions with experimental data from two experiments , one of which exhibiting fd .",
    "@xcite introduced the following system for an infinitely - deep weakly viscous fluid    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    [ ddz ]    here @xmath13 is the velocity potential of the fluid , @xmath14 is the free - surface displacement , @xmath15 is the acceleration due to gravity , and @xmath16 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "this model assumes that gravity and viscosity are the only external forces acting on the fluid .",
    "the euler equations are obtained from ( [ ddz ] ) by setting @xmath17 .",
    "substituting    @xmath18    @xmath19    into the linearized version of ( [ ddz ] ) gives its linear `` dispersion '' relation @xmath20 the @xmath21 term represents dispersion while the @xmath22 term represents ( wave - number dependent ) dissipation .",
    "this establishes that , according to this model , small - amplitude waves with large wave number will decay faster than small - amplitude waves with small wave number .",
    "following the work of @xcite , assume    @xmath23    @xmath24    [ ansatz ]    where @xmath25 is a positive constant and @xmath26 is a small dimensionless parameter . here",

    "nls is obtained from equation ( [ vbalone ] ) or ( [ vaalone ] ) by setting @xmath78 .",
    "the classical dysthe systems for the surface displacement and velocity potential are obtained from ( [ vb ] ) and ( [ va ] ) by setting @xmath79 .",

    "this is qualitatively different from other fd models that have two ( or more ) free parameters that can be used to fit the decay of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite showed that the dysthe system for the velocity potential ( the va system with @xmath79 ) preserves both @xmath3 and @xmath4 in @xmath81 while the dysthe system for the surface displacement ( the vb system with @xmath79 ) preserves @xmath3 , but not @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , they established that the sign of @xmath82 in the vb system with @xmath79 is not definite and therefore the dysthe system can predict frequency upshifting . @xcite conducted numerical studies of the vb system with @xmath79 and did not observe a permanent downshift in any of their simulations .",
    "these results suggest that the @xmath83 term ( the only term that differentiates the va and vb systems when @xmath79 ) is not the mechanism for fd .",
    "we note that the va system with @xmath79 is hamiltonian while the vb system with @xmath79 is likely not hamiltonian  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite derived a hamiltonian generalization of the dysthe system for the surface displacement .",
    "although we do not study this equation here , we expect that the results shown below will generalize to it because the @xmath84 viscosity term , @xmath85 , provides the mechanism for fd .",
    "the @xmath81 dependences of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the vb system are given by    @xmath86    @xmath87    [ dcqsa ]    where    @xmath88    @xmath89    further @xmath90 the cauchy - schwarz inequality establishes that @xmath91 .",
    "this suggests that the vb system will exhibit fd in the spectral mean sense .",
    "however , the sign of @xmath92 can vary , so fd is not necessarily guaranteed .",

    "fd does not occur in either the va or the vb system if either i ) @xmath79 ( i.e.  @xmath93 ) or ii ) @xmath94 ( not physically interesting ) .",
    "finally , equation ( [ dpm ] ) establishes that fd is a higher - order effect , corroborating the @xcite result that the dissipative nls equation preserves the spectral mean .",

    "this allows all complex @xmath96 to be considered by assuming , without loss of generality , that @xmath96 is a positive constant .",
    "the solution of this system is    @xmath106    @xmath107    [ wrwi ]    the constants of integration were chosen so that these ( viscous ) solutions limit to the solutions of the ( nonviscous ) dysthe system in the @xmath108 limit .",
    "note that ( [ omegar ] ) establishes that if @xmath109 , then to leading order all plane - wave solutions of the vb system decay to zero as @xmath110 . just as in nls and the dysthe system , choosing @xmath111 corresponds to shifting the wave number of the carrier wave .",
    "the function @xmath104 depends on @xmath97 in such a way that it takes into account the correct ( up to the order of the equation ) rate of dissipation for the shifted carrier wave ( see equations ( [ ddzdispersion ] ) and ( [ cov ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath112 for the remainder of the paper .      in order to study the stability of solutions of the form given in equation ( [ swsoln ] )",

    "note that the decay due to @xmath119 has been factored out in equation ( [ b0p ] ) .",
    "this allows the evolution of the perturbation , @xmath121 , to be directly compared to the constant @xmath96 . if @xmath116 and/or @xmath117 grow without bound in @xmath81 , we say that the solutions is linearly unstable ( even though the magnitude of the entire perturbed solution may decay to zero ) .    substituting ( [ pertform ] ) into ( [ vb ] ) , linearizing in @xmath115 , and separating into real and imaginary parts leads to a system of coupled pdes that have constant coefficients in @xmath122 and @xmath123 . without loss of generality ,",

    "however , @xmath135 determines the large-@xmath81 behavior of the solution because the @xmath81 dependent term is integrable on @xmath136 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath131 are @xmath137 this establishes that the long - term solution of ( [ odes ] ) is given by @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the constants of integration .",

    "therefore all plane - wave solutions of the vb system are linearly unstable .",
    "the growth rate of the instability is @xmath143 .",
    "this instability is not a benjamin - feir - like instability because _ all _ spatially dependent perturbations lead to exponential growth .",

    "in this section the validity of the vb system is tested by comparing its predictions with measurements from two physical experiments of one - dimensional , nearly monochromatic wave trains on deep water and predictions from the nls , dissipative nls , and dysthe equations .",
    "the waves were created by a plunger - type wave maker that oscillates vertically at one end of a 43-foot long and 10-inch wide wave channel .",

    "fd was observed in the second experiment , but not the first . for each experiment ,",
    "the wave gauges recorded time series lasting 23.4033 seconds .",
    "the experimental initial conditions were comprised of a carrier wave with a frequency of 3.33hz ( @xmath153 ) and one upper and one lower seeded sideband each separated from the carrier wave by 0.17092hz ( @xmath154 ) . complete experimental details are found in section 6 of @xcite .",
    "all equations were solved numerically by assuming periodic boundary conditions and using split - step pseudospectral methods that allow the linear parts of the pdes to be solved exactly in fourier space .",
    "the initial conditions for the pdes were @xmath155 this form was selected for the initial conditions because it contains all of the modes with significant amplitude measured by the first wave gauge .",
    "the complex conjugates of the amplitudes were used because of the change of variables in equation ( [ xicov ] ) . note that when solving the nls or dissipative nls equation , @xmath156 is set to zero in equation ( [ vbalone ] ) in order to determine the correct equation and then a value of @xmath156 from either table [ matable ] or [ latable ] was used in ( [ ics ] ) to obtain the appropriately scaled initial condition .",
    "table [ matable ] contains the values of the physical parameters for this experiment .",
    "figure [ fampsmod ] contains plots of the fourier amplitudes ( in centimeters ) versus @xmath157 , the distance from the first wave gauge ( in centimeters ) . unlike the plots in  @xcite ,",
    "the experimental data here are not scaled .",
    "although the amplitudes of the sidebands increase , the amplitude of the carrier wave is dominant at all measurement sites .",
    "this means that fd in the spectral peak sense did not occur in this experiment .",
    "the vb system provides the best predictions for all four of these quantities .",
    "it predicts a brief temporary frequency upshift followed by a downward trend .",
    "the dysthe equation predicts a temporary , but dramatic , frequency upshift that is quite different than what was experimentally observed .",
    "both the nls and dissipative nls predict that @xmath1 is constant even though the experimental data shows a definite downward trend .",
    "note that the plots of @xmath4 and @xmath1 make it obvious that the initial conditions used in the numerical simulations of the pdes do not exactly match the experimental initial conditions .",
    "this is because only the carrier wave and the first six sidebands are used in the initial conditions ( see equation ( [ ics ] ) ) .",
    "if more modes are included , the initial points line up more closely , but the qualitative behavior of the plots remains the same ."
