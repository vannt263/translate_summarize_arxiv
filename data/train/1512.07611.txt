    "rooted in a host organism or patch of habitat such as a dead log , tens of thousands of species of filamentous fungi rely on spores shed from mushrooms and passively carried by the wind to disperse to new hosts or habitat patches .",
    "a single mushroom is capable of releasing over a billion spores per day @xcite , but it is thought that the probability of any single spore establishing a new individual is very small @xcite . nevertheless in the sister phylum of the mushroom - forming fungi , the ascomycota , fungi face similarly low likelihoods of dispersing successfully , but spore ejection apparatuses are highly optimized to maximize spore range @xcite , suggestive of strong selection for adaptations that increase the potential for spore dispersal .",
    "spores disperse from mushrooms in two phases @xcite : a powered phase , in which an initial impulse delivered to the spore by a surface tension catapult carries it clear of the gill or pore surface , followed by a passive phase in which the spore drops below the pileus and is carried away by whatever winds are present in the surrounding environment .",
    "the powered phase requires feats of engineering both in the mechanism of ejection @xcite and in the spacing and orientation of the gills or pores @xcite . however , spore size is the only attribute whose influence on the passive phase of dispersal has been studied @xcite .",
    "spores are typically less than 10@xmath0 m in size , so can be borne aloft by an upward wind of only 1 cm / s @xcite .",
    "buller claimed that such wind speeds are usually attained beneath fruiting bodies in nature @xcite : indeed peak upward wind velocities under grass canopies are of order 0.1 - 1 cm / s @xcite .",
    "however even if the peak wind velocity in the mushroom environment is large enough to lift spores aloft : 1 .",
    "the average vertical wind velocity is zero , with intervals of downward as well as upward flow and 2 . mushrooms frequently grow in obstructed environments , such as close to the ground or with pilei crowded close together ( fig 1 a - b )",
    ". the pileus traps a thin boundary layer of nearly still air , with typical thickness @xmath1 @xcite , where @xmath2 is the horizontal wind velocity , @xmath3 the size of the pileus , and @xmath4 the viscosity of air @xcite ; no external airflow can penetrate into gaps narrower than @xmath5 .",
    "for typically sized mushrooms under a grass canopy ( with @xmath6 cm , @xmath7 cm / s , @xmath8 m@xmath9s@xmath10 ) , we find that @xmath11 mm .",
    "if the gap thickness between pileus and ground is smaller than @xmath5 then no external wind will penetrate into the gap .",
    "* spores can disperse from thin gaps beneath pilei without external winds . *",
    "we analyzed spore deposition beneath cultured mushroom ( shiitake ; _ lentinula edodes _ , and oyster ; _ pleurotus ostreatus _",
    ", sourced from ccd mushroom , fallbrook , ca ) as well as wild - collected _ agaricus californicus_. pilei were placed on supports to create controllable gap heights beneath the mushroom , and placed within boxes to isolate them from external airflows .",
    "we measured spore dispersal patterns by allowing spores to fall onto sheets of transparency film , and photographing the spore deposit ( fig .",
    "1c ) . in all experiments , spore deposits extended far beyond the gap beneath the pileus .",
    "spores were deposited in asymmetric patterns , both for cultured and wild - collected mushrooms ( fig .",
    "1d ) . using a laser light sheet and high speed camera (",
    "see materials and methods ) , we directly visualized the flow of spores leaving the narrow gap beneath a single mushroom ( fig . 1e and movie s1 ) : our videos show that spores continuously flow out from thin gaps , even in the absence of external winds .",
    "what drives the flow of spores from beneath the pileus ?",
    "some ascomycete fungi and ferns create dispersive winds by direct transfer of momentum from the fruiting body to the surrounding air .",
    "for example , some ascomycete fungi release all of their spores in a single puff ; the momentum of the spores passing through the air sets the air into motion @xcite .",
    "fern sporangia form over - pressured capsules that rupture to create jets of air @xcite . however , the flux of spores from a basidiomycete pileus is thousands of times smaller than for synchronized ejection by a ascomycete fungus , and pilei have no known mechanism for storing or releasing pressurized air .",
    "the only mechanism that we are aware of for creating airflows without momentum transfer is by the manipulation of buoyancy  an effect that underpins many geophysical flows @xcite and has recently been tapped to create novel locomotory strategies @xcite .",
    "* mushrooms evaporatively cool the surrounding air . *",
    "many mushrooms are both cold and wet to the touch @xcite ; the expanding soft tissues of the fruit body are hydraulically inflated , but also lose water quickly ( fig .",
    "we made a comparative measurement of water loss rates from living mushrooms and plants .",
    "the rate of water loss from mushrooms greatly exceeds water loss rates for plants , which use stomata and cuticles to limit evaporation ( fig .",
    "for both plants and pilei , rates of evaporation were larger when tissues were able to actively take in water via their root - system / mycelium , than for cut leaves or pilei .",
    "however , the pilei lost water more quickly than all species of plants surveyed under both experimental conditions .",
    "in fact , evaporation rates from cut mushrooms were comparable to a sample of water agar hydrogel ( 1.5% wt / vol agar ) , while evaporation rates from mushrooms with intact mycelia , were twofold larger ( fig 2b ) . taken together , these data suggest that pilei are not adapted to conserve water as effectively as the plant species analyzed",
    ".    the high rates of evaporation lead to cooling of the air near the mushroom , and may have adaptive advantage to the fungus .",
    "previous observations have shown that evaporation cools both the pileus itself and the surrounding air by several degrees celsius @xcite . specifically , since latent heat is required for the change of phase from liquid to vapor , heat must continually be transferred to mushroom from the surrounding air .",
    "we compared the ambient temperature of the air between 20 cm and 1 m away from _",
    "p. ostreatus _ pilei with intact mycelia , with temperatures in the narrow gaps between and beneath pilei , using a traceable liquid / gas probe ( control company , forestwood , tx ) .",
    "we found that gap temperatures were consistently 1 - 2@xmath12c cooler than ambient ( fig . 2c )",
    "the surface temperature of the pileus , measured with a dermatemp infra - red thermometer ( exergen , watertown , ma ) was up to 4@xmath12c cooler than ambient , consistent with previous observations ( @xcite and fig . 2c ) .",
    "evaporation alone can account for these temperature differences : in a typical experimental run , a pileus loses water at a rate of @xmath13 kg / m@xmath9s ( comparable with the data of @xcite ) . evaporating this quantity of water requires @xmath14 w / m@xmath9 of vaporization enthalpy . at steady state the heat flux to the mushroom",
    "must equal the enthalpy of vaporization ; newton s law of cooling gives that the heat flux ( energy / area ) will be proportional to the temperature difference , @xmath15 between the surface of the mushroom and the ambient air : @xmath16 where @xmath17 w / m@xmath9@xmath18c is a heat transfer coefficient @xcite . from this formula",
    "we predict that @xmath19c , in line with our observations .",
    "* increasing air density by cooling produces dispersive currents*. cooling air from the laboratory ambient ( @xmath20c ) down to @xmath21c increases the density of the air by @xmath22 kgm@xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the coefficient of expansion of air . cold dense air will tend to spread as a gravity current @xcite , and an order of magnitude estimate for the spreading velocity of this gravity current from a gap of height @xmath25 cm is given by von karman s law : @xmath26cm / s .",
    "although the air beneath the pileus is laden with spores , spore weight contributes negligibly to the creation of dispersive winds : in typical experiments , spores were released from the pileus at a rate of @xmath27540@xmath28 490 spores / cm@xmath9 s ( data from @xmath30 _ p. ostreatus _ mushrooms ) . if the mass of a single spore is @xmath31 kg and its sedimentation speed is @xmath32 m / s ( see discussion preceding equation ( 1 ) ) , then the contribution of spores to the density of air beneath the pileus is @xmath33 kgm@xmath23 , less than half of the density increase produced by cooling @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , water evaporation , rather than spores and the water droplets that propel them @xcite , constitute most of the mass lost by a mushroom .",
    "to prevent spore ejection , we applied a thin layer of petroleum jelly to the gill surfaces of cut mushrooms .",
    "treated mushrooms lost mass at a statistically indistinguishable rate to cut mushrooms that were allowed to shed spores ( fig .",
    "although our experiments were performed in closed containers to exclude external airflows it is still possible that spore deposit patterns were the result of convective currents created by temperature gradients in the lab , rather than airflows created by the mushroom itself . to confirm that spores were truly dispersed by airflows created by the mushroom we rotated the mushroom either 90@xmath12 or 180@xmath12 halfway through the experiment and replaced the transparency sheet . since the box remained in the same orientation and position in the lab",
    ", we would expect that if spores are dispersed by external airflows , the dispersal pattern would remain the same relative to the lab .",
    "in fact we found consistently that the direction of the dispersal current rotated along with the mushroom ( see figure s1 ) , indicating that mushroom generated air - flows are dispersing spores .",
    "we explored how the distance dispersed by spores depended on factors under the control of the parent fungus .",
    "the distance spores dispersed from the pileus increased in proportion to the square of the thickness of the gap beneath the pileus ( @xmath35 , fig .",
    "however , we found no correlation between spore dispersal distance and the diameter of the pileus or the rate at which spores were produced ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively , figure s2 ) .",
    "spores were typically deposited around mushrooms in asymmetric patterns , suggesting that one or two tongues of spore laden air emerge from under the pileus , and spores do not disperse symmetrically in all directions ( fig .",
    "these tongues of deposition were seen in wild - collected as well as cultured mushrooms ( fig .",
    "we dissected the dynamics of one of these tongues by building a two dimensional simulation of the coupled temperature and flow fields around the pileus .",
    "although real dispersal patterns are three dimensional , these simulations approximate the 2d dynamics along the symmetry plane of a spreading tongue . in our simulations",
    "we used a boussinesq approximation for the equations of fluid motion and model spores as passive tracers , since their mass contributes negligibly to the density of the gravity current .",
    "initially we modeled the pileus by a perfect half - ellipse whose diameter ( 4 cm ) and height ( 0.8 cm ) matched the dimensions of a _",
    "l. edodes _ pileus used in our experiments . however ,",
    "if cooling was applied uniformly over the pileus surface then spores dispersed weakly ( fig .",
    "weak symmetric dispersal can be explained by conservation of mass : cold outward flow of spore - laden air must be continually replenished with fresh air drawn in from outside of the gap . in a symmetric pileus , the cool air spreads along the ground and inflowing air travels along the under - surface of the pileus .",
    "so initially on leaving the gills of the mushroom , spores are drawn inward with the layer of inflowing warm air ; and only after spores have sedimented through this layer into the cold outflow beneath it do they start to travel outward ( fig 4a , upper panel ) .",
    "* asymmetric airflows are necessary for dispersal . * to understand how mushrooms can overcome the constraints associated with needing to maintain both inflow and outflow , we performed a scaling analysis of our experimental and numerical data .",
    "although the buoyancy force associated with the weight of the cooled air draws air downward , warm air must be pulled into the gap by viscous stresses . for fluid entering a gap of thickness @xmath38 , at speed @xmath2 , the gradient of viscous stress can be estimated as : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the viscosity of air .",
    "we estimate the velocity @xmath2 by balancing the viscous stress gradient with the buoyancy force ; @xmath41 i.e. : @xmath42 .",
    "we then adopt the notation that if @xmath43 is a quantity of interest ( e.g. temperature or gap height ) that can vary over the pileus , then we write @xmath44 for the value of @xmath43 on the right edge of the pileus and @xmath45 for its value on the left edge of the pileus .",
    "if @xmath46 then there is the same inflow on the left and right edges of the pileus , and dispersal is symmetric and weak .",
    "if there are different inflows on the left or right side of the pileus , then there can be net unidirectional flow beneath the pileus , carrying spores further .",
    "assuming , without loss of generality , that the net dispersal of spores is rightward , the spreading velocity of the gravity current can be estimated from the difference : @xmath47 ( right - moving inflow minus left - moving inflow ) . the furthest traveling spores originate near the rightward edge of the pileus and fall a distance @xmath48 ( the gap width on the rightward edge ) before reaching the ground . since the gravity current spreads predominantly horizontally , the vertical trajectories of spores are the same as in still air , namely they sediment with velocity @xmath49 and take a time @xmath50 to be deposited . by balancing the weight of a spore against its stokes drag , we obtain @xmath51 where @xmath52 kg / m@xmath53 is the density of the spore , and @xmath54 m is the radius of a sphere of equivalent volume@xcite .",
    "the sedimentation velocity , @xmath49 , can vary between species , ( typically @xmath55mm / s ) , but does not depend on the flow created by the pileus .",
    "the maximum spore dispersal distance is then : @xmath56_r^\\ell \\frac{h_r}{v_s } \\label{eq : scaling}\\ ] ] where we use the notation @xmath57^l_r$ ] to denote the difference in the quantity @xmath43 between the left and right sides of our model mushroom .",
    "unidirectional dispersal therefore requires either that @xmath58 ( i.e. there is a temperature gradient between the two sides of the pileus , fig 4a middle panel ) or @xmath59 ( i.e. the mushroom is asymmetrically shaped , fig 4a lower panel ) .",
    "these two cases can be distinguished by the dependence of dispersal distance upon the gap height : for a temperature - gradient induced asymmetry we predict : @xmath60^\\ell_r h_r^3 $ ] ( and @xmath61^\\ell_r h_r^2 $ ] ) , whereas for a shape induced asymmetry : @xmath62^\\ell_r h_r^2 $ ] ( and @xmath63^\\ell_r h_r$ ] ) .",
    "both scalings are validated by numerical simulations ( fig .",
    "when rescaled using equation ( [ eq : scaling ] ) , data from simulations with different values of @xmath64 , @xmath48 , @xmath65^l_r$ ] , @xmath66^l_r$ ] or @xmath49 all collapsed to two universal lines corresponding to temperature and height asymmetries ( fig .",
    "4c , d ) .",
    "experimental data from real mushrooms is fit well by @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "additionally the scaling ( [ eq : scaling ] ) accords with experimental observations that dispersal distance does not depend on pileus diameter or on the rate of spore release ( fig .",
    "we can not directly confirm that there are not temperature gradients over the pileus surface .",
    "but these data are consistent with shape asymmetry ; that is variation in the thickness of the pileus , and height of the gap , playing a dominant role in asymmetric spore dispersal from real mushrooms .",
    "additionally , we made another direct test of our scaling law ( [ eq : scaling ] ) by measuring @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "4e , and see materials and methods ) .",
    "when the dimensionless prefactors in ( [ eq : scaling ] ) were kept constant by using the same pileus , but the height of the gap , @xmath48 , was varied , we found that @xmath69 , consistent with the scaling for shape asymmetry - driven flow ( fig .",
    "* spores can disperse over barriers surrounding the pileus*. in nature , pilei may grow crowded together or under plant litter or close to the host or substrate containing the parental mycelium ( fig 1a - b ) ; thus , in addition to needing to disperse from the narrow gap beneath the pileus , spores may potentially also need to climb over barriers to reach external airflows .",
    "although the cold , spore laden air is denser than the surrounding air , to replace the cold air that continuously flows from beneath the pileus , warm air must be drawn in to the pileus .",
    "our simulations showed that when the gravity current met a solid barrier , the warm inflow and cold outflow could link to form a convective eddy ( figure s3 ) .",
    "we studied whether this eddy could lift spores into the air , and what effect this might have upon spore dispersal .",
    "we found that when mushrooms were surrounded by a vertical barrier ( see materials and methods ) , spores were dispersed over the barrier ( fig .",
    "5a ) provided that their horizontal range , predicted using equation ( 1 ) , exceeded the height of the barrier ( fig .",
    "surprisingly , spores climbing over the barrier were dispersed apparently symmetrically in all directions from the top of the barrier ( compare fig .",
    "5a with 1c ) over the entire area of the box containing the mushroom and barrier ( fig .",
    "in particular , the total horizontal extent of the spore deposit ( the size of the box ) typically greatly exceeded the horizontal range predicted by equation ( 1 ) , even without accounting for the distance traveled by the gravity current in crossing over the barrier .",
    "the enhancement of spore dispersal by a barrier can be attributed to the action of the recirculating eddy : spores that climb the barrier may enter the current of air that is pulled down to the mushroom to replace the cold spore laden air ( fig .",
    "5c ) . this eddy can carry spores up and further away from the barrier , and it is likely that no longer being constrained to travel along the ground surrounding the mushroom contributes to their increased range .",
    "why does the height that gravity currents need to climb up the barrier not reduce their dispersal distance ? in a climbing gravity current spores continue to sediment vertically downward . since the vertical velocity of a climbing gravity current ( @xmath70 cm / s ) is typically much larger than the sedimentation speed ( @xmath71 mm / s ) , spores do not sediment out of vertical gravity current as it climbs . to test this idea",
    "quantitatively , we numerically simulated spore dispersal by a gravity current that encounters a barrier inclined at an angle @xmath72 to the horizontal . since the velocity of the gravity current",
    "is directed parallel to the barrier , spores can still sediment toward the barrier , but at a reduced sedimentation velocity @xmath73 .",
    "( sedimentation parallel to the barrier , with velocity @xmath74 can be neglected ) .",
    "revisiting equation ( [ eq : scaling ] ) we therefore predict that spores will disperse a distance @xmath75 , i.e. they will travel a factor of @xmath76 further up the slope than they would travel horizontally , and this prediction agrees quantitatively with numerical simulations ( fig .",
    "5c ) . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath77 ( a vertical wall ) , we predict no sedimentation onto the wall , consistent with experimental observations that the distance that a gravity current climbs up a vertical wall does not reduce its horizontal spreading .    finally we note that , though our experiments were designed to exclude external winds , in nature wind speed tends to increase with height above the ground @xcite , so spore that travel upward and then away from the vertical wall may be more likely to reach dispersive winds .",
    "mushrooms are not simple machines for producing the largest number of spores , but directly influence the dispersal of those spores , even during the phase of their dispersal previously considered to be passive . rather than being the result of failure to evolve water - conserving adaptations , rapid water loss from the pileus enables mushrooms to create convective cells for dispersing spores .",
    "convectively - generated winds provide a mechanism for spore dispersal for pilei that are crowded close together or close to the ground .",
    "indeed , the presence of nearby boundaries for the upward flowing part of the current to climb may enhance spore dispersal .",
    "our analysis of convective dispersal adds to an increasing body of work revealing that fungal sporocarps are exquisitely engineered to maximize spore dispersal potential @xcite .",
    "although evaporative cooling is an essential ingredient for spore dispersal and has been observed in many species @xcite , our analysis reveals the previously unreported role played by the asymmetric thickness of the pileus , or of the gap beneath it in shaping and amplifying the dispersive wind created by the mushroom .",
    "asymmetric spreading of spores was seen both in cultured and wild - collected mushrooms ( respectively _ l. edodes _ and _ a. californicus _ ) with circular pilei .",
    "although in some environments mushrooms may be able to rely on external winds to disperse their spores from the moment that spores are ejected , we have highlighted two common growing configurations in which there is likely to be little external wind in the gap beneath the pileus .",
    "there are an unknown number of such low - wind environments or niches for which the pileus generated wind may drive or assist spore dispersal . moreover , the combination of controls that can be used by the fungus to manipulate dispersal distance ( including gap width , asymmetry and temperature gradients ) creates the potential for mechanistic explanations for why some species may disperse more effectively than others @xcite .",
