    "many systems of physical interest possess symmetries which in turn induce invariant submanifolds in their state spaces .",
    "a great deal of effort has gone into the study of the dynamics and intermittent behaviour of such systems near their invariant submanifolds ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . a class of dynamical systems with invariant submanifolds have been shown to be capable of producing a number of novel modes of behaviour , including on  off intermittency , which occurs as the result of an instability of an attractor in an invariant submanifold @xcite .",
    "it manifests itself as an attractor whose trajectories get arbitrarily close to an attractor for the system in the invariant submanifold while intermittently making large deviations away .",
    "it can be modelled by a biased random walk of the logarithmic distance from the invariant submanifold @xcite .",
    "since the linearised behaviour near an invariant submanifold has a natural skew product structure ( i.e.  the linearised dynamics transverse to the invariant submanifold is forced by the dynamics within the submanifold ) many such studies have tended to concentrate on systems that are of _ skew product _",
    "type for simplicity , although it should be stated that on - off intermittency can be found in systems that do not have skew product structure .",
    "moreover , bifurcation problems in such settings have tended to concentrate on _ normal _ parameters , i.e.  parameters that vary the global dynamics without changing the dynamics within an invariant submanifold . in general ,",
    "dynamical systems are not skew products over the dynamics within any invariant subspace , and moreover they do _ not _ possess normal parameters@xcite .",
    "the authors @xcite have recently shown that dropping these assumptions can lead to the presence of a number of novel types of dynamical behaviour , including a new type of intermittency , referred to as _ in  out intermittency_. the presence of this type of intermittency has also been found in different distinct nonlinear dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there have been interesting developments concerning the study of other phenomena  e.g.  _ riddling _  in these more general settings @xcite .",
    "to characterise in  out intermittency , it is best to contrast it with on  off intermittency , as they both can occur in systems with invariant submanifolds . to begin with",
    ", it is useful to bear in mind that even though on  off intermittency can occur in non  skew product settings , all its necessary ingredients can be satisfied in skew product settings . in  out",
    "intermittency , on the other hand , requires the _ absence _ of skew product structure for its existence .",
    "briefly , we say that an attractor @xmath0 exhibits _ in  out intermittency _ to the invariant submanifold @xmath1 , if the following are true @xcite :    1 .",
    "the intersection @xmath2 is not necessarily a minimal attractor , i.e.  there can be proper subsets of @xmath3 that are attractors ( for on  off intermittency @xmath3 is assumed to be minimal ) .",
    "this means that there can be different invariant sets in @xmath3 associated with attraction and repulsion transverse to @xmath3 , hence the name in  out",
    ". these growing and decaying phases come about through different mechanisms within @xmath1 .",
    "if the system has a skew  product structure , in  out intermittency reduces to on  off intermittency @xcite .",
    "[ in - out - trajectory ] shows a schematic representation of a typical trajectory for an in  out process near @xmath1 .",
    "+ # 1#20.54#1 2 .",
    "the minimal attractors in the invariant submanifold are not necessarily chaotic ( as for on - off intermittency ) ; they are very frequently periodic or equilibria .",
    "furthermore , the trajectory remains close to one of these attractors during the moving away or `` out '' phases , with the important consequence that during these `` out '' phases the trajectory can shadow a periodic orbit , for example , while drifting away from @xmath1 at an exponential rate @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the asymptotic scaling of the probability distribution of the duration of laminar phases in the in  out case can have two contributions : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are positive real constants depending on the bias of the random walk modelling the `` in '' phase and the probability of leaking into the deterministic `` out '' phase ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the term @xmath8 corresponds to biased on  off intermittency , while the extra term @xmath9 can cause an identifiable shoulder to develop at large laminar sizes @xmath10 which can help to statistically distinguish in  out from on  off intermittency .",
    "the authors in @xcite were motivated by a numerical exploration of a two dimensional map and explored the statistics by means of a markov chain model .",
    "our aims in this paper are twofold .",
    "firstly , we demonstrate the occurrence of in  out intermittency in dynamical systems generated by ordinary differential equations ( ode ) as well as by partial differential equations ( pde ) .",
    "the latter are especially of interest , since they are in principle infinite dimensional and also because few examples of intermittent behaviour and their scalings have been shown concretely to occur in such models ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . secondly , by choosing as our models the mean  field dynamo models @xcite , the occurrence of this type of intermittency could be of interest in understanding certain features of solar and stellar variability , and in particular we expect that due to its generic features , it may well appear in more detailed and accurate models of solar and stellar variability .",
    "mean - field dynamo models have been employed extensively in order to study various aspects of the dynamics of solar , stellar and galactic dynamos ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "their rather idealised nature has been criticized by a number of authors ( see e.g.@xcite ) . however , such models are thought to capture some of the essential physics of the turbulent processes and reproduce many important dynamical and statistical features of the full three dimensional magneto - hydrodynamical models ( see e.g.  @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "the standard mean  field dynamo equation is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the mean magnetic field and mean velocity respectively and the turbulent magnetic diffusivity @xmath14 and the coefficient @xmath15 arise from the correlation of small scale turbulent velocities and magnetic fields @xcite .    in axisymmetric geometry , equation ( [ dynamo ] ) is solved by splitting the magnetic field into poloidal and toroidal components , @xmath16 , and expressing these components in terms of scalar field functions @xmath17 in spherical polar coordinates @xmath18 .",
    "equation ( [ dynamo ] ) can then be expressed in terms of equations for the scalars @xmath0 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and we consider a purely rotational velocity @xmath22 .",
    "nondimensionalisation of these equations in terms of a length @xmath23 and a time @xmath24 produces the convective and rotational magnetic reynolds numbers @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are typical values of @xmath15 and @xmath29 .",
    "solutions to these equations are often considered in the @xmath30 limit where the terms in @xmath15 can be ignored in the equation for @xmath19 , giving a single dynamo parameter @xmath31 on rescaling .",
    "this reflects the fact that , in stellar convective zones , rotational shear produces toroidal flux much more effectively than the processes represented by the @xmath15 terms , whilst in the full equations ( the so called @xmath32 limit ) we retain both @xmath33 and @xmath34 as two control parameters .",
    "the equation ( [ dynamo ] ) gives a kinematic dynamo , since the velocity field @xmath13 is prescribed .",
    "as this equation stands there is no mechanism to limit the growth of the magnetic field a nonlinear saturation mechanism is usually supplied by making @xmath15 depend on @xmath12 .",
    "this can be done by supplying a closed functional form representing a fixed approximation of the nonlinear effect ( c.f.@xcite ) , or more dynamically , by supplying an auxiliary equation for @xmath15 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    in the following we consider two cases arising from two separate studies @xcite : the above pde model in the @xmath32 limit with two different algebraic forms for @xmath35 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite and figs .",
    "[ inoutpde1 ] and [ inoutpde2 ] captions ) as well as a finite order truncation of it in the @xmath30 limit but with a time dependent form of the @xmath15 effect in one spatial dimension ( this can be obtained by averaging ( [ dynamo ] ) over @xmath36 ) and using a spectral expansion @xcite .",
    "this ode model possesses a second ( alongside @xmath37 ) control parameter , the magnetic prandtl number @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the turbulent kinematic viscosity , which arises from the time dependent equation for @xmath15 .",
    "this model is given by    @xmath40    where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are spatially independent coefficients of the spectral expansions of the scalar fields @xmath0 , @xmath19 and @xmath15 respectively , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are coefficients expressible in terms of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the truncation order and @xmath37 and @xmath50 are the parameters defined above .",
    "the detailed derivation of these equations together with a phenomenological study of their dynamics is given in @xcite .",
    "we note that the main ingredients necessary for the occurrence of in  out intermittency are present in both these models . both are axisymmetric and possess invariant submanifolds .",
    "more precisely , the truncated model ( [ truncated ] ) with @xmath49=4 is a 12dimensional system of odes with two 6dimensional symmetric and antisymmetric invariant submanifolds given by @xmath51 @xmath52 respectively .",
    "similarly the pde model ( [ alpha2omega ] ) possesses two invariant submanifolds , the antisymmetric and symmetric invariant submanifolds which are given by @xmath53 @xmath54 respectively , where @xmath55 is the latitude .",
    "if one separates the poloidal and toroidal scalar field components into symmetric and antisymmetric parts then the dynamic evolution for the symmetric ( antisymmetric ) components has contributions from antisymmetric ( symmetric ) counterparts .",
    "this means that these equations are of non  skew product type . for the ode system ( [ truncated ] ) this can be readily seen by noting that the evolution equation for each component in @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) contains components from @xmath57 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "for the pde models , we first note that @xmath13 in equation ( [ dynamo ] ) is not dynamical : it is prescribed and therefore can be viewed as a part of the initial conditions .",
    "the non - skew product nature of the pde models follows in a similar way to the ode models , bearing in mind the form of the equation ( [ dynamo ] ) and those of the invariant submanifolds ( [ submanifolds ] ) and ( [ submanifolds2 ] ) .",
    "finally the control parameters @xmath37 and @xmath50 appearing in the ode model ( [ truncated ] ) are generically non  normal as they enter the equations for @xmath41 and @xmath43 for all @xmath58 . similarly this is also true for the control parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the case of the nondimensionalised version of the pde equations ( [ alpha2omega ] ) .    in this way , both models possess all the necessary ingredients for the occurrence of in  out intermittency .",
    "# 1#20.47#1    given that the ode models are more transparent , we first demonstrate the presence of in  out intermittency in the truncated system ( [ truncated ] ) with @xmath49=4 . for this model , in  out intermittency occurs for parameter values for which the system of equations ( [ truncated ] ) restricted to @xmath57 is within a _ window of periodicity _ ( c.f.@xcite ) .",
    "fig.[lyapunov ] depicts the presence of such windows for the ode model ( [ truncated ] ) .",
    "the presence of such windows is supported by a conjecture of barreto _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , according to which for chaotic systems with @xmath48 positive lyapunov exponents and @xmath59 control parameters , with @xmath60 , there is a dense set of nearby parameter values at which the attractors are periodic .",
    "this implies that for our system ( [ truncated ] ) , for each parameter value at which there is a chaotic attractor in @xmath57 there are parameter windows arbitrarily close for which the attractor is periodic .",
    "[ inoutode ] shows an example of in  out intermittency in this system at parameter values @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we note that even though the interval reported here over which in  out occurs is small , nevertheless there are likely to be other intervals ( according to the conjecture of barreto _ et al .",
    "_ , possibly an infinite number of them ) over which this happens .",
    "the top panel shows the periodic orbit in the antisymmetric invariant submanifold , @xmath57 , which the projection of the trajectory of the full system shadows clearly ( second panel ) .",
    "this shadowing or intermittent periodic locking of the tangential variables occurs within the laminar phases ( third panel ) where there is a simultaneous exponential growth ( hence the name `` out '' phase ) of the amplitudes of the transverse variables through several orders of magnitude ( bottom panel ) .",
    "this last panel also shows the `` in '' phases , which can be modelled as a biased random walk taking the trajectory into the invariant submanifold .",
    "# 1#20.47#1    # 1#20.44#1    to substantiate this further , we also calculated the scaling of the probability distribution of the duration of laminar phases and this is shown in fig .  [ scalingode ] .",
    "this is compatible with the predicted scaling ( [ scaling ] ) , possessing both a @xmath63 section , at small laminar phase sizes , as well as a noticeable shoulder at higher laminar phase sizes , the latter being a distinctive signature of the in - out intermittency .    #",
    "1#20.47#1    # 1#20.47#1    these signatures , namely the periodicity of the attractor of the system restricted to the invariant submanifold , the periodic locking and the exponential growth of the `` out '' phases together with the compatibility with the scaling ( [ scaling ] ) clearly show the occurrence of in  out intermittency in the truncated ode dynamo systems .    to demonstrate the occurrence of in  out intermittency in the pde case ( which as shown above also possesses all of the required ingredients ) , we integrated equation ( [ alpha2omega ] ) , in parameter regions suggested by @xcite , using the code described in @xcite and implemented by @xcite .",
    "[ inoutpde1 ] and [ inoutpde2 ] give examples of in  out intermittency in these pde models@xcite .",
    "as can be seen , this behaviour can occur with the invariant submanifold being either antisymmetric ( fig .",
    "[ inoutpde1 ] ) or symmetric@xcite ( fig.[inoutpde2 ] ) .",
    "again , in addition to the presence of periodic behaviour in the system restricted to the invariant submanifold ( top panels ) , these figures clearly show the presence of locking during the `` out '' phases ( second panels ) with an exponential growth of the energy of the transverse modes through several orders of magnitude ( bottom panels ) .",
    "this behaviour mirrors very closely the truncated ode model shown in fig .",
    "[ inoutode ] as well as that expected to occur from the theory @xcite . to substantiate this further",
    ", we again looked at the compatibility of the scaling for the distribution of the laminar phases with the theoretical scaling given by ( [ scaling ] ) . despite the greatly enhanced numerical cost of integrating the pde equations long enough to obtain convergence to the scaling law , we have been able to establish agreement in this case as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ scalingpde ] .",
    "together , these signatures clearly demonstrate the occurrence of in  out intermittency in these pde dynamo models .    # 1#20.44#1",
    "by establishing the main ingredients necessary for the occurrence of in  out intermittency as well as checking the predicted corresponding phase space signatures and predicted scalings , we have concretely demonstrated the occurrence of this type of intermittency in both ode and pde models .",
    "this type of intermittency requires for its existence the non  skew product feature , the generality of which makes the occurrence of this type of intermittency of potential interest .",
    "the models chosen here are mean  field dynamo models , which despite their approximate nature are thought to capture many features of magnetic activity in solar  type stars . an important",
    "observed feature of variabilities in solar - type stars is the presence of dynamical behaviour with different statistics over different time intervals due to the occurrence of the so called grand minima during which the amplitude of the magnetic activity is greatly diminished .",
    "a number of scenarios have been suggested in order to explain these phenomena ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . within the deterministic framework ,",
    "intermittency @xcite ( and multiple intermittency @xcite ) has been put forward as a possible mechanism .",
    "a number of studies have found intermittent types of behaviour in such models ( e.g.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the concrete demonstration of in  out as well as other forms of intermittency are of potential importance in this regard as they demonstrate the possible types of dynamical variability that can occur in such settings .",
    "we thank axel brandenburg and david moss for helpful conversations .",
    "ec is supported by a pparc postdoctoral fellowship , pa was partially supported by epsrc grant gr / k77365 and rt benefited from pparc uk grant no .",
    "l39094 .",
    "in fact only model systems possess invariant submanifolds .",
    "this is usually either due to the absence of exact symmetries or to the presence of noise .",
    "the study of such systems in the presence of noise is under consideration and will be published elsewhere : p.  ashwin , e.  covas , and r.  tavakol , `` influence of noise on in  out intermittency '' , in preparation ( 2000 ) .",
