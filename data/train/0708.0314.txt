    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and spectroscopy ( sts ) is a key tool in nanoscience , allowing for both manipulation of nano - objects and access to their energy spectrum and wave function ( wf ) . the class of systems under study is broad and loosely defined , ranging from nanotubes to quantum dots ( qds ) and molecules .",
    "their common features are the possibility of achieving relatively good electrical insulation , the discreteness of their energy spectrum , and the manifestation of coulomb blockade phenomena at low temperatures . in these few - body systems",
    "electron - electron interaction may play a major role , as it is immediately apparent e.g.  from single - electron charging experiments.@xcite    some of us recently suggested that the wf imaging technique of sts could be a sensitive and direct probe of electron correlation.@xcite despite recent experimental evidence that few - body semiconductor qds are strongly affected by electron correlation , as seen both in inelastic light scattering@xcite and high source - drain@xcite spectroscopies , all qd wf images obtained so far , both in real@xcite and reciprocal@xcite space , were basically interpreted in terms of independent - electron wfs . in this paper",
    "we apply many - body tunneling theory to a realistic model which fully takes into account the combined effect of dot anisotropy and coulomb interaction and predict that sts maps can be strongly distorted by correlation effects .",
    "these calculations are validated by a recent low - temperature - sts experiment performed by a few of us on few - electron inas qds at the university of hamburg , which was reported in ref .   and that we here review providing further details and discussion of the theoretical model .",
    "while in this paper we focus exclusively on semiconductor qds , we stress that the main ideas regarding how electron correlation affects sts could in principle be applied also to short carbon nanotubes as well as single molecules .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : after a review of conceptual frameworks used to understand sts ( sec .",
    "[ s : concept ] ) , we illustrate our full configuration interaction ( fci ) method of calculation of sts images ( sec .",
    "[ s : fci ] ) and theoretically focus on the double charging of a qd in various realistic regimes ( sec .",
    "[ s : predictions ] ) .",
    "we discuss the evidence of correlation effects provided by the hamburg experiment ( sec .",
    "[ s : hamburg ] ) , and eventually reconsider our findings in the conclusions ( sec .",
    "[ s : conclusions ] ) .",
    "in order to understand the origin of correlation effects in sts , it is useful to critically reconsider the basic picture of sts performed in the presence of coulomb blockade . figure 1 displays schematically the typical energy landscape along the tunneling direction seen by an electron flowing from the stm tip to a drain lead ( backgate in fig .",
    "1 ) through the qd .",
    "the qd is well isolated from tip and backgate by two tunneling barriers ( the vacuum and an insulating layer , respectively ) , so the width of its discrete energy levels is negligible . at low temperature transport",
    "occurs mainly due to resonant tunneling through the qd chemical potentials @xmath0 , which are depicted as segments in the qd region of fig .",
    "1 [ @xmath1 is the number of electrons filling in the qd at equilibrium and @xmath2 is its ground - state energy].@xcite if the tip - backgate voltage @xmath3 is small , current may flow or not ( coulomb blockade ) depending if some value of @xmath1 exists such that @xmath4 enters the transport energy window . by increasing @xmath3 one",
    "is able to widen the transport window , causing a step in the current @xmath5 to occurr ( a peak in the differential conductance @xmath6 in the inset of fig .",
    "1 ) each time the chemical potential @xmath7 for a new electron number @xmath8 enters the window .    in the standard sts mean - field",
    "theory,@xcite the chemical potentials @xmath4 s are simply hartree - fock or kohn - sham single - particle ( sp ) self - consistent levels , split in energy by coulomb and exchange interactions in addition to the effect of quantum confinement .",
    "the energy- and space - resolved local density of sp states , @xmath9 , is just given by a sum over the occupied sp orbitals @xmath10 , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the energy of the @xmath13th sp level .",
    "a general result of many - body time - dependent perturbation theory , valid to first order in the tunneling matrix element,@xcite is that @xmath6 is proportional to the local electron density .",
    "is the fermi energy of the stm tip .",
    "upper right inset : corresponding idealized @xmath6 vs. @xmath3 plot ( ignoring all broadening mechanisms but resonant tunneling ) . ]    therefore , in the framework of mean - field theory , the local value of the differential conductance , @xmath14 , is given by a sum over the square moduli of sp orbitals whose energies fall in the transport window @xmath15 around the fermi energy @xmath16 , @xmath17 . if the energy resolution is sufficient , the space - resolved map of @xmath14 provides the image of the square modulus of a _ single _ sp orbital , namely the highest - energy occupied qd orbital , akin to the homo in molecules .",
    "besides , the sts energy - scan mode exhausts the _",
    "aufbau _ filling sequence of the lowest - energy sp levels of the dot .    since in general the qd energy spectrum strongly depends on electron - electron interaction and consequently on @xmath1,@xcite the above mean - field theory suffers a few serious drawbacks : ( i ) each tunneling event involves the transition between qd ground states with @xmath1 and @xmath18 electrons , therefore it is unclear which value of @xmath1 should be used in the @xmath1-dependent computation of self - consistent sp orbitals @xmath19.@xcite ( ii ) the interacting @xmath1-electron ground state @xmath20 is in general a linear superposition of many electronic configurations ( slater determinants ) , @xmath21 , with expansion coefficients @xmath22 , @xmath23 , while mean - field theory approximates @xmath20 with a single slater determinant , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) : this approximation turns out to be poor in strongly correlated regimes.@xcite    in order to circumvent the above difficulties we recall from many - body tunneling theory that the differential conductance is proportional to the _ interacting _ local density of states,@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the energy- and space - resolved exact zero - temperature retarded green s function ( or one - electron propagator).@xcite the quantity on the r.h.s . of eq .",

    ", the calculation of @xmath29 requires the knowledge of the ( configuration interaction ) expansion coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the interacting ground - states @xmath20 and @xmath33 with both @xmath1 and @xmath34 electrons , respectively , according to the formula @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a sp quantum index depending on both slater determinants @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "distortion effects of @xmath29 with respect to @xmath39 are due to the quantum interference among different sp orbitals @xmath40 . in the non - interacting limit ,",
    "both @xmath1- and @xmath41-electron ground states are single slater determinants , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and therefore @xmath29 reduces to the simple sp orbital @xmath44 .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional qd with parabolic lateral confinement , which is a commonly accepted approximation@xcite in the framework of the envelope - function description of sp states : @xmath45 in the sp hamiltonian for the @xmath46th electron of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hsp ] ) the lateral confinement is different in the @xmath47 and @xmath48 directions ( with corresponding confinement frquencies @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively ) : such an elliptical confinement mimics the combined effects of geometrical deviations from perfect circularity and/or atomistic effects@xcite due to strain , piezolectric fields , interface matching , which lower the symmetry point - group from @xmath51 ( circular case ) to @xmath52 [ the symmetry point - group of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hsp ] ) , @xmath53 , is actually slightly larger than the @xmath52 group ] .",
    "in addition , we include into our model the full coulomb interaction among the @xmath1 electrons populating the dot : @xmath54 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hsp]-[eq : hi ] ) @xmath55 and @xmath56 are respectively the electron charge and static relative dielectric constant of the host semiconductor , @xmath57 is the canonically conjugated momentum of position @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the electron effective mass .",
    "we solve numerically the few - body problem of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hi ] ) for the ground states of @xmath1 and @xmath34 electrons by means of the fci method , that we successfully applied in predicting qd transport@xcite and raman@xcite spectra ( for full details on our fci method , its performances , and ranges of applicability , see ref .  ) .",
    "briefly , we expand the @xmath1-electron interacting ground state @xmath20 on the basis of the slater determinants @xmath21 obtained by filling in with @xmath1 electrons in all possible ways a subset of the sp orbitals , eigenstates of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hsp ] ) . on the slater - determinant basis , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hi ] ) is a large , sparse matrix that we diagonalize by means of a parallel state - of - the - art lanczos code .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath22 , which are the output of the fci calculation , are eventually used to build the quasi - particle wf @xmath29 .",
    "we here consider quasi - particle wf images for realistic qds predicted by the theory of secs .",
    "[ s : concept]-[s : fci ] , focusing on the simplest case where electron correlation becomes relevant , namely the tunneling transition @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , the image of the first charging process @xmath61 is simply given by the lowest - energy sp orbital .",
    "we first investigate the case of a circular qd by monitoring the evolution of the square modulus of @xmath29 as a function of the lateral confinement energy @xmath62 . on a general basis",
    ", we expect that correlation effects are negligible in the non - interacting limit @xmath63 while they dominate in the opposite limit @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , the sp [ eq .  ( [ eq : hsp ] ) ] and the coulomb [ eq .  ( [ eq : hi ] ) ] terms of the interacting hamiltonian scale differently with @xmath65 , the former as @xmath66 and the latter as @xmath67 ( ref .  ) . when @xmath68 the sp term dominates with respect to the coulomb term , and the ground state is essentially a single slater determinant , while interaction effects can be regarded as a perturbation : in this limit mean - field theory is expected to give correct predicitons . in the opposite limit , instead , the coulomb term very effectively mixes many slater determinants , and significant distortions of @xmath29 with respect to the non - interacting case are expected .",
    "ground state transition @xmath60 , as a function of lateral confinement energy @xmath65 and dot anisotropy .",
    "( a - c ) dependence of the sts image on the lateral confinement energy @xmath65 in the case of a circular dot .",
    "plots ( a - c ) correspond to @xmath69 @xmath70 , 0.5 , 0.01 mev , respectively , with @xmath71 .",
    "( d - e ) dependence of the sts image on the dot anisotropy . plots ( d - e ) correspond to @xmath72 1 , 1.1 , 1.5 , respectively , with @xmath73 2 mev .",
    "the lateral extension of all plots is 4 @xmath74 4 units of the characteristic lateral extension of the harmonic oscillator @xmath75^{1/2}$ ] , and gaas parameter are used throughout the paper .",
    "plot heights are renormalized arbitrarily .",
    "the absolute norms of sts maps are given in table [ t : tab1 ] . ]",
    "figures 2(a - c ) display the maps of @xmath76 in the @xmath77 plane for decreasing values of @xmath65 [ from top to bottom , @xmath78 ( a ) , @xmath79 0.5 mev ( b ) , @xmath79 0.01 mev ( c ) ] . in the non - interacting case [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , the sts map is just a replica of the sp 1@xmath80 orbital , eigenstate of the 2d harmonic oscillator ( a 2d gaussian ) , corresponding to the injection of a second electron into the same 1@xmath80 level occupied by the first electron with opposite spin , according to pauli exclusion principle .",
    "as @xmath65 is decreased , we see that a significant portion of weight is moved from the image center into an outer ring [ fig .",
    "in a very shallow dot [ fig .",
    "2(c ) ] , the dot center is completely emptied and the sts image now looks like a donut .",
    "the latter case of strong interaction shows that the sts image can be very different from that expected by a naive application of the aufbau principle , due to the hybridization of higher - energy sp orbitals with the 1@xmath80 wf .    in fig .",
    "2 the length unit is the characteristic lateral extension of the harmonic oscillator , @xmath75^{1/2}$ ] , which depends on @xmath81 , and @xmath29 is arbitrarily normalized .",
    "another effect of correlation is the loss of absolute weight of the quasi - particle wf as @xmath65 is decreased.@xcite    .[t : tab1]norm of the quasi - particle , @xmath82 , for different ground - state @xmath83 ground - state tunneling transitions @xmath60 .",
    "the weight ranges between 0 and 1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ t : tab1 ] shows the norm of @xmath29 for the cases displayed in fig .",
    "we see that the reduction of the confinement energy @xmath65 in a circular qd is associated to a dramatic weight loss .",
    "this trend may be seen as a signature of the wigner crystallization of the @xmath41- and @xmath1-electron ground states which manifests itself as an increased `` rigidity '' of the states opposing electron injection .",
    "we now switch to consider the effect of dot anisotropy , since the dependence of sts images on dot ellipticity was found to be a major issue in the hamburg experiment ( cf .",
    "[ s : hamburg ] below).@xcite in fig .",
    "2(d ) we start showing the predicted sts map for a circular qd with @xmath69 2 mev , and then modify its ellipticity by increasing the lateral frequency ratio @xmath84 , going from @xmath72 1.1 [ fig .",
    "2(e ) ] up to @xmath72 1.5 [ fig .",
    "by doing so , as we move downwards in the right column of fig .  2 , we expect to `` squeeze '' the quasi - particle wf along the @xmath47 direction , which is indeed observed for both single and double charging processes .",
    "however , in the present double charging case , we also see an unexpected effect , i.e.  the quasi - particle wf develops two peaks along the @xmath48-axis .",
    "this surprising distortion is due to the destructive interference between 1@xmath80 and 1@xmath85 states of the harmonic oscillator along @xmath48 ( belonging to the same representation @xmath86 of the @xmath53 group ) , which is a correlation effect .",
    "this can also be seen as a manifestation of the general statement that the importance of correlation increases as the system dimensionality is reduced ( from 2d to 1d ) .    to conclude this section",
    ", we mention that another issue relevant to sts images is the type of dielectric environment felt by qd electrons.@xcite specifically , the dielectric mismatch between vacuum and inas in the hamburg experiment affects both the sp confinement potential ( self - polarization effect ) and the electron - electron interaction ( interaction with surface image charges of like sign ) , therefore changing the relative importance of their effect on the ground state .",
    "qualitatively , we expect that changing the dielectric environment causes effects similar to those obtained by modifying @xmath65 .",
    "we studied strain - induced inas qds grown on n - doped gaas(001 ) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe).@xcite an undoped tunneling barrier 5 nm thick insulates the freestanding qds from a n - doped gaas buffer layer 200 nm thick , acting as a backgate for the current flowing from the stm tip through the qds .",
    "the samples were transferred from the mbe into the stm chamber in ultra - high vacuum without being exposed to the air by means of a mobile system , in ordered to avoid contamination , and stm was operated at a background pressure smaller than @xmath87 mbar and at @xmath88 6 k with maximum energy resolution of @xmath89 2 mev.@xcite stm images were taken in constant - current mode , with a typical sample bias in the range of 2 - 4 v and a tunneling current of 20 - 40 pa .",
    "a lock - in technique ( modulation voltage @xmath90 in the range of 5 - 20 mv ) was used to record @xmath91 and wf mapping was carried out over a specified area by stabilizing the tip - surface distance in each point @xmath92 at voltage @xmath93 and current @xmath94 , switching off the feedback and recording a @xmath6 curve from @xmath95 to @xmath96 ( @xmath97).@xcite as a result , wf mapping produces a 3d array of @xmath6 data , which allows obtaining spatially resolved @xmath91 images at different values of sample voltages .",
    "spatial maps recorded at the voltages 840 ( map a ) , 1040 ( b ) , 1140 ( c ) , and 1350 ( d ) mv , respectively , for a representative qd .",
    "the size of all maps is 30 @xmath74 30 nm .",
    "white ( black ) colour stands for high ( low ) values of @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath98 100 pa , @xmath99 1500 mv , @xmath100 4 mv . ]    in fig .",
    "3 we show @xmath91 maps of a representative qd measured at fixed voltages corresponding to four clearly localized qd wfs , labeled ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , respectively , in order of increasing energy.@xcite we observed a pronounced shape anisotropy for all dots , which have a pyramidal shape with well - defined facets , consistently with previous findings.@xcite this is evident also from the elongation of images ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) of fig .  3 along the [ 10 ] direction . in detail , wf maps of fig .  3 show the following approximate symmetries , going from low to high - energy : @xmath80-like for ( a ) , @xmath101-like for ( b ) and ( c ) , and possibly ( d ) .",
    "the ( d ) image is somehow blurred , likely because states of the wetting layer overlapping in energy with ( d ) significantly contribute to the spectral density .",
    "see ref .   for further discussion .",
    "as expected for the square moduli of the two lowest - energy sp 1@xmath80 and 2@xmath101 orbitals , images ( a ) and ( b ) exhibit a roughly circular symmetric intensity distribution and elongation along the [ 10 ] direction with a node in the center , respectively ( fig .",
    "unexpectedly , image ( c ) shows again a @xmath101-like symmetry in the [ 10 ] direction , as before , instead of [ 110 ] as expected for the second 2@xmath101 orbital.@xcite as a consequence , it is not possible to explain the wf sequence [ and map ( c ) in particular ] in terms of sp orbitals , since in this case we would expect the appearance of either a single 2@xmath101 or two 2@xmath101 states elongated in the [ 10 ] and [ 110 ] directions , respectively . on the other hand , from a mean - field point of view the charging of the same 2@xmath101 orbital with a second electron can be excluded since a replica is not observed for the 1@xmath80 orbital .    on this basis , we believe that the understanding of the data of fig .  3 must rely on the theory developed in sec .",
    "[ s : predictions ] , taking into account the combined effect of electron correlation , dot anisotropy , and dielectric mismatch .",
    "specifically , we assign maps ( a ) and ( b ) to the tunneling events @xmath61 corresponding to resonances through 1@xmath80 and 2@xmath101 sp states , while we associate image ( c ) of fig .  3 to the ground state @xmath83 ground state charging process @xmath60 , showing features similar to those predicted in figs .",
    "2(e - f ) .",
    "further support for this interpretation is reported in ref .  .",
    "in this paper we have focused on qds where electron - electron interaction may be relevant , showing that the sts technique is sensitive to quasi - particle wfs and that their images can be greatly affected by electron correlation . on the basis of fci calculations of sts maps which fully take into account correlation effects and dot anisotropy , we have been able to understand measured wf images of freestanding self - assembled inas quantum dots .",
    "we identified ground- and excited - state wfs corresponding to the injection of a first and a second electron into the qd .",
    "correlation effects are found to distort the wf corresponding to double charging in an essential way .",
