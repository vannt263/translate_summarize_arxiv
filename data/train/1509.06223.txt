    "flavor symmetry plays essential role in classification of the hadrons .",
    "the light hadronic states are successfully described by using su(3 ) flavor symmetry . in the case",
    "this symmetry is exact , hadrons belonging to the same representation of su(3 ) flavor group could be degenerate . experimentally it is known that the hadrons belonging to the same representation have different masses , which leads to su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking . at quark level",
    ", this symmetry is broken due to the mass difference of the light u , d and s quarks .",
    "the breaking of the su(3 ) flavor symmetry might lead to mixing of hadrons .",
    "in other words , the definite flavor eigenstates can mix to form the physically observed states .",
    "long time ago , it is observed that the lowest lying hadrons @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be represented as the combination of the su(3 ) octet , pure isospin @xmath4 , and @xmath5 baryons in the following form @xcite , [ emix01 ] ^0 - ^0  , + ^0 + ^0  .",
    "the @xmath6 mixing angle is estimated in framework of the quark model whose value is predicted to be @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "very recently , the lattice qcd ( lqcd ) group presented the latest estimate on @xmath6 mixing angle to have the value @xmath8 @xcite , which is approximately two times smaller compared to the prediction of the quark model .",
    "the aim of the present note is to determine the @xmath0@xmath1 mixing angle within the qcd sum rules , and compare this mixing angle with the predictions of the quark model and lqcd .    in determination of the @xmath0@xmath1 mixing angle within the qcd sum rules we follow the method suggested in @xcite , and for this goal we start by considering the following correlation function , [ emix02 ] = i d^x e^ipx 0 \\{_h(x ) |_h(0 ) } 0  , where t is the time ordering operator , @xmath9 is the interpolating current , carrying the same quantum numbers as the corresponding hadron .",
    "if the bare @xmath10 and @xmath11 states are mixed , the corresponding physical states with definite mass should be the linear combinations of these bare states . in this case , the interpolating currents corresponding to the physical states could be represented as the superposition of the interpolating currents corresponding to the bare states , i.e. , [ emix03 ] _ _ ^0 + _ ^0  , + _ _ ^0 - _ ^0  , where @xmath12 is the mixing angle between @xmath13 and @xmath14 states . in presence of only two physical states , eq .",
    "( [ emix02 ] ) can be written as , [ emix04 ] = i d^4x e^ipx 0 \\{_(x ) | _ } 0  .",
    "it should be remembered that the general form of the correlator function is , [ nolabel01 ] ( p ) = _ 1(p^2 ) + _ 2(p^2 ) i  , and coefficients of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( unit operator ) structures , i.e. , @xmath17 and @xmath18 can both be used in determining the mixing angle .    in order to construct the sum rules for the mixing angle @xmath12 , the correlation function ( [ emix04 ] ) is calculated in terms of hadrons , quarks and gluons .",
    "using the duality ansatz these two representations are matched and the sum rules for the corresponding physical quantity is obtained .",
    "the hadronic representation of the correlation function is obtained by saturating it with the full set of baryons having the same quantum numbers as the corresponding interpolating current .",
    "since @xmath19 and @xmath20 can create only the states @xmath21 and @xmath22 , correspondingly , the hadronic part of the correlation function is obviously zero . using eq .",
    "( [ emix03 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ emix04 ] ) , one can easily obtain the expression for the mixing angle for both structures , [ emix05 ] 2= 2 _ ^0 _ ^0 - _",
    "^0  , where @xmath23 are the correlation functions corresponding to the unmixed states , i.e. , [ emix06 ] _",
    "ij^0 = i d^4x e^ipx 0 \\ { _ i^0 ( x ) _ j^0 } 0  , where @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "so the problem of determination of the mixing angle requires the calculation of the theoretical part of the correlation function , for which the expressions of the interpolating currents are needed .    according to the @xmath26 classification",
    "the interpolating currents for the unmixed @xmath13 and @xmath14 are chosen as , [ emix07 ] _ ^0 2 ^abc \\{2 ( u^at c d^b ) _ 5 s^c + 2 ( u^at c _ 5 d^b ) s^c + ( u^at c s^b)_5 d^c + ( u^at c _ 5 s^b ) d^c + ( d^at c s^b)_5 u^c - ( d^at c _ 5 s^b ) u^c }  , + _",
    "^0 ^abc \\{(u^at c s^b ) _ 5 d^c + ( u^at c _ 5 s^b ) d^c + ( d^at c s^b ) _ 5 u^c + ( d^at c _ 5 s^b ) u^c }  , where @xmath27 are the color indices , @xmath28 is the charge conjugation operator , and @xmath29 is the arbitrary constant with @xmath30 corresponding to the so  called ioffe current .    using the operator product expansion at @xmath31 , one can easily obtain the expressions for the correlation functions @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 from eq .",
    "( [ emix03 ] ) from the qcd side for the @xmath35 and @xmath16 structures .",
    "the expressions of these correlation functions are presented in the appendix .    in",
    "order proceed for the numerical calculations we need the values of the input parameters that are given as : @xmath36 @xcite , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 @xcite . for the masses of the light",
    "quarks we use their @xmath40 values given as : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "it follows from the expressions of the invariant functions that in order to determine the @xmath0@xmath1 mixing angle three arbitrary parameters are involved , namely , the continuum threshold @xmath44 , the borel mass parameter @xmath45 , and the parameter @xmath29 ( see the expressions of the interpolating currents ) ; and of course the mixing angle should be independent of them all . as is well known , the continuum threshold is related to the energy of the first excited state .",
    "the difference @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the mass of the ground state , is equal to the energy needed to excite the particle to its first energy state .",
    "this difference usually changes in the range between @xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "it follows from the analysis of the mass sum rules that in order to reproduce the experimental values of the masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons , the continuum threshold @xmath44 should lie in the range @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the working region of the borel mass parameter should be such that , the results for the @xmath0@xmath1 mixing angle should exhibit good stability with respect to the variation of @xmath45 at fixed values of @xmath44 .",
    "the upper bound of @xmath45 is obtained by demanding that the higher states and continuum contributions should be less than 30% of the total result .",
    "the lower bound of @xmath45 is determined from the condition that the contributions of higher dimensional operators should be less than the perturbative one . from these conditions",
    "the working region of @xmath45 is determined to be @xmath51 .    in figs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we present the dependence of the mixing angle @xmath12 on @xmath45 at the value of the continuum threshold @xmath52 and , at several fixed values of the auxiliary parameter @xmath29 , for the coefficients of the structures @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . we observe from fig .",
    "( 1 ) that in the range @xmath53 of the borel parameter , the mixing angle @xmath12 exhibits good stability for the values of the auxiliary parameter @xmath54 for the structure @xmath15 . as can be traced from fig .",
    "( 2 ) , the mixing angle @xmath12 seems to be rather stable at all considered values of the auxiliary parameter @xmath29 for the structure @xmath16 at the fixed value of the continuum threshold @xmath52 .",
    "our final attempt for determination of the mixing angle is to find the region of @xmath29 where the mixing angle exhibits insensitivity to its variation .",
    "for this aim we study the dependence of the mixing angle @xmath12 on @xmath55 where @xmath56 , at several fixed values of @xmath45 and at @xmath52 , and presented them in figs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) for the coefficients of the structures @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . in this respect ,",
    "the results of our numerical analysis depicted in figs . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) can be summarized as follows :    * for the structure @xmath15 , in the above  determined working regions of @xmath45 and @xmath44 , the best stability for the mixing angle is achieved when @xmath57 , and the mixing angle is found to have the value @xmath58 . * for the structure @xmath16 not only there is no stability region for the mixing angle , but also the mixing angle changes its sign .",
    "therefore prediction for the value of the mixing angle from the structure @xmath16 is not reliable .",
    "therefore we conclude that , the final result for the mixing angle is @xmath59 which is obtained from the @xmath15 structure . the error in determination of the mixing angle can be attributed to the uncertainties in the value of the continuum threshold @xmath44 , the quark condensates , and the scale parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the results presented in this work can further be improved by taking @xmath60 corrections in to account .",
    "finally , we compare our result on the @xmath0@xmath1 mixing with the calculations of the quark and lattice qcd models , whose predictions are , [ nolabel02 ] 0.86 ^ 0  ,  @xcite + 0.40 ^ 0 0.026 ^ 0  ,  @xcite respectively . from these results we observe that , our prediction on the @xmath0@xmath1 mixing angle is very close to the result obtained in the quark model , and more than two times larger compared to that of the result obtained in the lattice qcd model .",
    "a reliable lattice qcd determination of the @xmath0@xmath1 mixing angle requires an equally highly accurate reproduction of the octet baryon mass differences , which has not yet been established .    in conclusion , the mixing angle between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons is estimated within the framework of the light cone sum rules method .",
    "a comparison of our result with the predictions of the quark and lattice qcd models is presented .",
