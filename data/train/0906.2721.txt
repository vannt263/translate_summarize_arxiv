    "<S> we present a global fit to the structure function @xmath0 measured in lepton - proton experiments at small values of bjorken-@xmath1 , @xmath2 , for all experimentally available values of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , using the balitsky - kovchegov equation including running coupling corrections . using our fits to f@xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , we reproduce available data for f@xmath6 and perform predictions , parameter - free and completely driven by small - x evolution , to the kinematic range relevant for the lhec .    deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering ( dis ) experiments constitute one of the main sources of information about the partonic structure of hadrons , as well as a testing ground of pqcd techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the dis program carried out in hera has explored an unprecedented kinematic regime in the dis variables @xmath3 and bjorken-@xmath1 . at small values of @xmath1 , the emission of additional soft gluons in the hadron wavefunction </S>",
    "<S> is enhanced by factors of @xmath7 , resulting in a fast growth of the gluon density of the hadron with decreasing bjorken-@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> such growth has been observed in data and , at small enough values of @xmath1 , or , equivalently , for large gluon densities , it is expected to be tamed by repulsive gluon - gluon self - interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the latter mechanism is known as _ saturation _ of the gluon distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is non - linear phenomenon , closely related to unitarity of the theory , which is not included in the more standard linear approaches to dis based on the dglap or bfkl pqcd evolution equations . here </S>",
    "<S> we present an analysis of available dis data at small-@xmath1 based on the non - linear balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation including the recently calculated running coupling corrections to the evolution kernel @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the starting point of our analysis is the dipole model of dis , which stems from the @xmath8-factorization theorems in the high - energy limit . </S>",
    "<S> it states that , at small-@xmath1 , the virtual photon - proton cross section can be written as a convolution of the light - cone wavefunction for a virtual photon to split into a quark - antiquark dipole , @xmath9 , times the cross section for dipole - proton interaction . for a hadron homogeneous in the transverse plane , </S>",
    "<S> one has : @xmath10 where the subscripts t , l stand for the polarization of the virtual photon ( transverse or longitudinal ) , @xmath11 is the dipole transverse size and @xmath3 the photon virtuality . </S>",
    "<S> explicit expressions for @xmath12 in the case of any number of active flavors can be found in @xcite . in our analysis </S>",
    "<S> we consider only the three flavor case , i.e , with no charm quark . </S>",
    "<S> all the information about the strong interactions , and also all the @xmath1 dependence of the absorption cross section , is encoded in the imaginary part of the dipole scattering amplitude , @xmath13 ( related to the dipole cross section through the optical theorem ) . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization @xmath14 in originates from integration over the transverse plane , trivial in the case of a _ cylindrical _ proton considered here , and will be one of the free parameters in the fit . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusive dis structure function is then given by @xmath15 whereas the longitudinal structure function @xmath16 is obtained by just considering the longitudinal component .    </S>",
    "<S> general arguments in qcd indicate that the dipole scattering amplitude is small for small dipole sizes @xmath11 ( _ color transparency _ ) , whereas large dipoles suffer a large absorption . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenological works in the context of saturation parametrize the transition between these two regimes , _ dilute _ and _ saturated _ , in terms of a @xmath1-dependent saturation scale @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 for @xmath19 , whereas @xmath20 for @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the parametrization depend on the physical input considered in each case . </S>",
    "<S> the leading @xmath1-dependence of the structure functions is thus encoded in that of the saturation scale , commonly assumed to have a power - law behavior : @xmath22 gev@xmath23 , with the _ evolution speed _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 being a free parameter fitted to experimental data . the results from different groups , albeit using slightly different parametrizations of the dipole amplitude , report @xmath25 .    in this work , rather than resorting to phenomenological models </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the @xmath1-dependence of the dipole amplitude in terms of the pqcd non - linear bk evolution equation including the recently calculated running coupling corrections . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the original , leading - log ( ll ) in @xmath26 bk equation yields an evolution speed @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the bare coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such value is too large to attempt a good description of data . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the running coupling corrections to the ll kernel obtained through resummation of @xmath29 terms bring the evolution speed down to values compatible with those extracted from data , among other interesting dynamical effects @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath33 is the largest experimental value of @xmath1 included in the fit . </S>",
    "<S> the precise shape of the running coupling kernel @xmath34 depends on the scheme chosen to single out the ultra - violet divergent contributions from the finite ones that originate after the resummation of quark loops . </S>",
    "<S> it was found in @xcite that the prescription suggested by balitsky in @xcite minimizes the role of the subleading contributions , and is therefore better suited for phenomenological applications . </S>",

    "<S> we obtain an excellent fit to available experimental data for the inclusive dis structure function @xmath36 with @xmath51 and all existing values for @xmath3 , @xmath52 gev@xmath23 , which adds up to 847 data points . in order to smoothly go to photoproduction , </S>",
    "<S> we have used the following redefinition of the bjorken variable : @xmath53 , with @xmath54 gev for the three light flavors considered in this work . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data included in the fit has been obtained by the h1 and zeus collaborations ( hera ) and by the e665 ( fermilab ) and nmc ( cern ) collaborations . the parameters from the fit are presented in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that the quality of the fit and the values of the parameters are stable under the restriction of the data range to the region @xmath55 gev@xmath23 ( which leaves 703 data points for the fit ) . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison between a selection of experimental data and the results from the fit for @xmath36 is shown in fig . [ figf2 ] . the two initial conditions _ gbw _ and _ mv _ offer equally good fits to data . with the parameters values yielded by the fit </S>",

    "<S> the theoretical results have been computed at the same @xmath56 as the experimental ones.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the analyses of available data , including this work , offer compelling evidence for the presence of gluon saturation effects . </S>",
    "<S> however , a clear distinction from alternative ( linear ) approaches can not yet be established unambiguously . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a good description of all data for @xmath57 can be achieved using dglap fits , even though the very application of dglap at such low @xmath3 is questionable . on the other hand , the observables like @xmath58 which are more sensitive to the gluon distribution are poorly determined experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed lhec @xcite may have the potential to disentangle different physical scenarios through a deeper exploration of the small-@xmath1 kinematic region . </S>",
    "<S> the question rises of which observable is best suited to pin down the saturation of the proton gluon distribution . </S>",
    "<S> a partial answer is given in fig . </S>",

    "<S> it presents a nnpdf1.2 dglap fit @xcite to pseudodata for proton f@xmath5 and f@xmath6 in the kinematic regime relevant for the lhec ( down to @xmath59 approx . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudodata are generated by extrapolation of the fit to f@xmath5 presented here using bk evolution , and thus include saturation effects . while @xmath0 can be well fitted by dglap , </S>",
    "<S> the best dglap fit to pseudotata underestimate @xmath58 at small @xmath3 and overshoots it at the largest @xmath3 considered , yielding a large @xmath60d.o.f .. one concludes that a precise experimental determination of @xmath58 at the lhec over a large enough @xmath3 range might suffice to pin down the kinematic region where departure between dglap and non - linear ( or , maybe , linear resummed small-@xmath1 evolution ) takes place , while @xmath0 does not offer such discrimination power .    -1 cm   ( left plot ) and f@xmath6 ( right plot ) generated by extrapolation of our fits down to @xmath59 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 gev@xmath23.,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( left plot ) and f@xmath6 ( right plot ) generated by extrapolation of our fits down to @xmath59 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 gev@xmath23.,title=\"fig : \" ] </S>"
