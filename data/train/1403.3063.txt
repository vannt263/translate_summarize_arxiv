    "clusters of galaxies contain hundreds or thousands of galaxies with a full range of luminosities , going from low - luminosity dwarf galaxies to @xmath13 galaxies and beyond .",
    "if clusters are dynamically relaxed systems , we naturally expect the brightest galaxies , which are presumably the most massive ones , to be concentrated in the central regions of clusters , since this is the most stable configuration .",
    "in particular , in each cluster , we expect to find the brightest galaxy cluster ( bcg ) at rest at the center .",
    "@xcite refer to this assumption as the `` central galaxy paradigm . ''",
    "this paradigm has played an important role in the development of semi - analytical models of galaxy formation over the past twenty years . in the early model of @xcite",
    ", each dark matter halo can host a central galaxy plus a number of satellite galaxies . in the initial state , halos contain only a mixture of cold and hot gas , with no galaxy . eventually , a central galaxy forms at the center of each halo .",
    "then , when a merger between several halos takes place , the central galaxy of the most massive progenitor becomes the central galaxy of the new halo , while all other galaxies become satellite galaxies . in this model ,",
    "the brightest galaxy in a halo is always the central one .",
    "many other semi - analytical models of galaxy formation have been developed since , and the central galaxy paradigm remains a key ingredient for most of them @xcite , thought some models locate the central galaxy at the minimum of the gravitational potential @xcite , which can be off - center if the halo contains substructures .",
    "halo occupation modeling @xcite and large n - body simulations of structure formation in cdm universes @xcite also rely on the assumption that the brightest galaxy is located in the center of the parent halo .",
    "several studies assume a phenomenological model that a massive `` central '' galaxy lies at the center of the host dark matter halo , and `` satellites '' constitute of the remaining galaxies in the halo ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "observations attempt to quantify the correlations and differences between the properties ( like sfr , color ) of central and satellite galaxy populations , and their dependence on the environment @xcite . also , many observational techniques are based on the assumption that the central galaxy paradigm is valid .",
    "these include measurement of halo masses by satellite kinematics @xcite , weak lensing @xcite , and strong lensing @xcite , and automated identification of groups and clusters in redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "observational studies of galaxy clusters have been performed in order to test the validity of the central galaxy paradigm @xcite .",
    "two different approaches are used in these studies .",
    "the first one consists of measuring the difference in radial velocity between the bcg and the cluster itself , and comparing it to the velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "the second one consists of measuring the projected distance between the bcg and the center of the cluster , estimated either from the distribution of galaxies or from the peak x - ray luminosity .",
    "the overall conclusion is that the central galaxy paradigm is usually valid , that is , most bcgs are at rest at the center of their host cluster , but many of them are not , too many to be dismissed as peculiar objects . in two of the most recent studies , @xcite studied a large sample of clusters containing 1426 candidate bcgs , and found that a significant number of bcgs have large peculiar velocities , the median value being 32% of the radial velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of @xmath14 galaxies from the _ sloane digital sky survey _ ( sdss ) , and found that the fraction @xmath8 of clusters in which the brightest galaxy is not the central one varies from 0.25 for low - mass clusters to 0.40 for high - mass one . in both papers ,",
    "the authors suggest that major mergers between clusters might explain their results .",
    "the central galaxy paradigm is based on the assumption that the galaxies inside a parent cluster either formed concurrently with the cluster , or later , after the distribution of dark matter and gas in the cluster had settle into an equilibrium configuration @xcite .",
    "one alternative scenario is that the cluster formed by the merger of smaller groups @xcite , and that the galaxy that will eventually become the bcg already existed in one of these groups @xcite .",
    "if the cluster has not yet reached equilibrium by the present , this could explain the off - center location and peculiar velocity of the bcg .",
    "our goal is to test this _ merging - group scenario _ , as @xcite call it .",
    "we performed a numerical simulation of the formation and evolution of the galaxy and cluster populations inside a large cosmological volume , in a @xmath1cdm universe .",
    "this is a challenging task : to obtain statistically meaningful results , we need to simulate a volume sufficiently large to contain several massive clusters . at the same time",
    ", we need to describe the formation and evolution of the galaxy population down to low - mass galaxies . to achieve this",
    ", we combine a large n - body cosmological simulation with a semi - analytical subgrid treatment of galaxy formation , merging , and tidal destruction .",
    "the objectives of this work are ( 1 ) to determine if the observational results reported by @xcite , @xcite , and others can be reproduced using a numerical simulation , ( 2 ) to investigate the role played by major mergers in the build - up of clusters , and determine if the merging - group scenario constitutes a valid explanation for the observational results , and ( 3 ) to check the robustness of the various statistics used to assess the success or failure of the central galaxy paradigm .",
    "the reminder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we describe our algorithm for simulating the formation and evolution of the galaxy and cluster populations .",
    "results are presented in section  3 .",
    "summary and conclusion are presented in section  4 .",
    "the numerical algorithm is described in details in @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we reuse the simulation that was presented in @xcite .",
    "we simulate the formation of large - scale structures in a cubic volume of comoving size @xmath15 , using a particle - mesh ( pm ) algorithm , with @xmath16 equal - mass particles and a mesh @xmath17 .",
    "the mesh spacing is @xmath18 , which gives the comoving length resolution of the algorithm .",
    "we assume a concordance @xmath1cdm model with density parameter @xmath19 , cosmological constant @xmath20 , and hubble constant @xmath21 .",
    "the total mass in the box is @xmath22 and the mass per particle is @xmath23 .",
    "galaxies are represented by using one single particle per galaxy .",
    "the code creates galaxies each of mass @xmath24 in regions where the density exceeds 200 times the mean density of the universe at that redshift .",
    "when that condition is satisfied , a `` galaxy particle '' is introduced , and the masses of the nearby particles is reduced accordingly . as the simulation proceeds , these galaxy particles are allowed to merge , forming more massive galaxies at later epochs .",
    "they can also tidally disrupt one another .",
    "the mergers and tidal disruption of galaxies are modeled using a semi - analytical prescription . for details",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite . as we showed in that paper",
    ", this algorithm successfully reproduces the observed luminosity function of galaxies , and provides a full description of the history of galaxy and cluster formation .",
    "the algorithm keeps track of the total mass @xmath25 of each galaxy . to facilitate comparison with observations ,",
    "we ascribe a stellar mass and a luminosity to each galaxy .",
    "we calculate luminosities using the @xmath26 ratio given in @xcite , equation  ( 17 ) : @xmath27\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ( this is their m1 model ) .",
    "we can estimate the luminosity of a galaxy using @xmath32 . since @xmath33",
    ", @xmath34 increases monotonically with @xmath35 .",
    "hence , we will assume that , in each simulated cluster , the bcg is simply the most massive galaxy in the cluster .",
    "we should keep in mind that is an estimate , because @xmath36 is an average over an ensemble of galaxies . in the real universe",
    ", there might be some clusters in which the bcg is not the most massive galaxy . to estimate the stellar mass @xmath37",
    ", we use the fitting formula given by @xcite , equations  ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) .",
    "the stellar mass and luminosity corresponding to the minimum galaxy mass @xmath38 are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the simulation produces 50 dumps between redshifts @xmath41 and @xmath2 . , but the first galaxies form at @xmath41 , so earlier dumps are not useful .",
    "] each dump contains the positions , velocities , and masses of three types of particles : the @xmath42 particles the simulation started with , the particles representing galaxies , and the particles representing tidal fragments , that is , galaxies that have been destroyed by tides .",
    "these latter particles do not enter in the analysis , except when computing the global properties of clusters ( total mass , center - of - mass position and velocity , velocity dispersion , @xmath43 ) .",
    "versus @xmath44 , averaged over all 28 clusters with @xmath45 ( circles ) .",
    "error bars show 1-@xmath11 uncertainty on the value of the mean .",
    "the solid curve shows a fit to the clusters in the 2df survey ( see text).,width=480 ]    for each dump , we build a cluster catalog , using a standard friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking length equal to 1/4 of the mean particle spacing ( that is , @xmath46 comoving ) .",
    "all three types of particles are included .",
    "we excluded clusters containing fewer than 4000 particles , corresponding to a mass @xmath47 . at @xmath2 ,",
    "the simulation volume contains 1788 clusters .",
    "two of these clusters have a mass @xmath48 and 16 more clusters have a mass @xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed mass function of clusters @xcite .",
    "we also calculated the radial projected density profiles of clusters , following @xcite . for each cluster , we first calculated the virial radius @xmath49 , and then the projected surface density @xmath50 calculated using galaxies only .",
    "we then averaged over clusters to get @xmath50 as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "the length resolution of our simulation is @xmath51 . in order to compute @xmath50 over one decade in radius , from @xmath52 to @xmath53",
    ", we selected all clusters with @xmath45 , thus ensuring that the entire range in radius is above the resolution limit .",
    "this represents a total of 28 clusters for the whole simulation .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ profiles ] ( circles ) .",
    "the solid curve is not a fit to our own results , but rather a fit to the clusters in the 2df survey .",
    "this fit is taken directly from the top left panel of figure  8 in @xcite , using the parameters listed in their table  2 . because we included only 28 clusters ,",
    "our error bars are larger than the ones in @xcite , but the results are consistent .",
    "in the following subsections , we compare our results with observations , focusing on two recent observational studies : @xcite and @xcite . before making these comparisons , we want to mention the similarities and differences between our numerical samples and their observational ones . @xcite used the sdss galaxy group catalog of @xcite .",
    "it contains @xmath54 galaxies with magnitude @xmath55 and redshift @xmath56 , forming @xmath57 clusters ( they use the word `` group '' ) .",
    "hence , most clusters contain only one galaxy . from this sample , they selected for analysis a subsample of 6760 clusters with masses @xmath58 containing at least 3 galaxies each .",
    "@xcite selected 1169 clusters from the catalog of @xcite .",
    "this sample includes only rich clusters up to redshift @xmath59 , with at least 30 galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath60 $ ] , where @xmath61 is the magnitude of the third brightest member .",
    "they identified the bcg in each cluster , and retained several candidates when the identification was ambiguous , so they ended up with 1426 bcg s .",
    "their analysis does not involve satellite galaxies ( galaxies other than the bcg s ) . in our simulation , the number of galaxies increases with time . at @xmath2 our numerical sample consists of @xmath62 galaxies with mass @xmath6 .",
    "the hubble velocity across the computational volume is @xmath63 , corresponding to a redshift @xmath64 which can be taken as the depth of our sample .",
    "we identify 1788 clusters with a mass @xmath3 .",
    "these clusters contain a total of @xmath65 galaxies , with one galaxy per cluster in the poorest ones , and 7765 galaxies in the richest one ( cluster c01 , see section 3.5 below ) .",
    "hence , our sample is similar to the one used by @xcite in terms of number of clusters .",
    "our shallower depth ( @xmath64 compared to 0.2 ) is compensated by the fact that a numerical simulation provides an effective sky coverage of 100% .",
    "the sample used by @xcite is significantly larger than ours , with 2.7 times more galaxies and 3.7 times more clusters , with the minimum cluster mass 30% lower than ours .",
    "in which the brightest galaxy is not the one closest to the center , versus cluster mass .",
    "solid circles : our results at @xmath2 ; solid triangles : results of @xcite ; open triangles : predictions from the morgana semi - analytic model ; open squares : predictions of @xcite semi - analytic model.,width=480 ]    for each cluster , we calculated the projected distances between the galaxies and the center of mass of the cluster .",
    "we only considered galaxies with total masses @xmath66 , corresponding to a stellar mass @xmath67 and a luminosity @xmath68 .",
    "this is our mock detection limit .",
    "we then identify the brightest galaxy , and the galaxy closest to the center .",
    "figure  [ fbnc ] shows the fraction @xmath8 of clusters in which the brightest galaxy is not the central one , versus the mass of the clusters .",
    "we average over bins of width @xmath69 .",
    "error bars are 1-@xmath11 uncertainties on the value of the mean for each bin , that is , the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of clusters in each bin ( we refer the reader to @xcite for the calculation of the horizontal error bars on their results ) .",
    "the solid circles show the results for our simulated clusters , at @xmath2 .",
    "the solid triangles , open triangles , and open squares are taken directly from figure  9 of @xcite .",
    "the solid triangles show their results , while the open symbols show the predictions of the morgana semi - analytical model ( @xcite , open triangles ) the semi - analytical model of @xcite ( open squares ) .",
    "we find that @xmath8 increases with cluster mass .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite and of the morgana model , while the @xcite model predicts a drop in @xmath8 at masses @xmath70 . in this mass range ,",
    "our results are , within error bars , fully consistent with the ones of @xcite . at lower masses , our simulations and",
    "the semi - analytical models all predict that @xmath8 continues to decrease with decreasing cluster mass , while the results of @xcite show levelling - off of @xmath8 around 0.25 at low masses .",
    "these authors speculate that the discrepency between the observational results and the predictions of the semi - analytical models is caused by various shortcomings of the latter .",
    "in particular , the dynamical friction time - scale tends to be too short in semi - analytical models , resulting in galaxies being accreted too rapidly .",
    "we do observe a similar phenomenon at the late stages of our simulation , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "adding this to the fact that our simulation does not include galaxies with masses below @xmath24 , we probably have a deficit of low - mass galaxies in small clusters , which would explain the low values of @xmath8 .",
    "for this reason , we will avoid drawing any conclusion based of the value of @xmath8 for low - mass clusters .",
    "figure  [ fbnc2 ] shows @xmath8 vs. cluster mass at three different redshifts , @xmath71 , 0.2 , and 0 , for our simulation . the corresponding lookback times ( time elapsed since those redshifts )",
    "are @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , respectively . within error bars",
    ", @xmath8 is independent of redshift .",
    "ideally , clusters should evolve toward equilibrium with time .",
    "the fact that @xmath8 does not decrease with time implies that some process is maintaining clusters out of equilibrium .",
    "major and semi - major mergers are the likely culprits , as we shall see later .",
    "( solid circles ) , @xmath59 ( open circles ) , and @xmath71 ( crosses ) . for clarity ,",
    "results at @xmath59 and @xmath71 were shifted by @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively.,width=480 ]       in which the brightest galaxy is not the one closest to the center , versus cluster mass , in our simulation .",
    "solid circles : @xmath8 calculated using projected distances , as in figures  [ fbnc ] and  [ fbnc2 ] ; open squares : @xmath8 calculated using actual 3d distances . for clarity , the latter results were shifted by @xmath75.,width=480 ]    ) .",
    "the solid circle identifies the bcg .",
    "the cross identifies a galaxy whose mass is just below the detection threshold @xmath77.,width=480 ]    the resolution limit of our simulation is of order @xmath51 .",
    "this might cause a problem if several galaxies , including the bcg , are located within that distance to the center . in such case",
    ", we could not unambigously determine which galaxy is the closest to the center .",
    "fortunately , a central region of radius @xmath51 is quite compact , and the likelihood of finding several galaxies in that region is small .",
    "we counted the number of galaxies in the central region at @xmath2 for all 1788 clusters in the simulation .",
    "we found 465 clusters with no galaxy in the central region , 1312 clusters with one galaxy , 11 clusters with two galaxies , and no cluster with more than two galaxies .",
    "hence , there is an ambiguity in identifying the central galaxy for 11 clusters , or 0.6% of the cluster population .",
    "furthermore , all these are low - mass clusters .",
    "the most massive has a mass of @xmath78 and the 10 others have a mass below @xmath79 .",
    "as we explained above , we are avoiding drawing conclusions based on the value of @xmath8 for these clusters .",
    "there are two other sources of uncertainties in the determination of @xmath8 for a given redshift and mass range .",
    "the first one is statistical .",
    "@xmath8 is the fraction of clusters for which the bcg is not the closest galaxy to the center .",
    "the more clusters we have , the more accurate the determination of @xmath8 will be .",
    "this is illustrated by the error bars in figures  [ fbnc ] and  [ fbnc2 ] .",
    "these error bars become very large at high masses because we only have a few clusters in these mass bins .",
    "the second source of uncertainty comes from the difficulty in determining whether , for a particular cluster , the bcg is the closest galaxy to the center or not .",
    "two effects make this determination difficult .",
    "first , observers deal with projected distances on the plane of the sky , whereas the distance that enters in the central galaxy paradigm is actually the 3d distance . in a simulation",
    ", we have the luxury of knowing all components of the positions , and we can therefore calculate 3d distances .",
    "so we recalculated @xmath8 , using this time the full 3d separation between the galaxies and the center of mass of the clusters . in figure",
    "[ fbnc_3d ] , we compare these results with the ones obtained using the projected distances . at low masses ,",
    "the results are nearly identical , or well within error bars .",
    "things are different in the highest mass bin : the `` real '' value @xmath8 , the one computed using 3d distances , appears to be significantly below the `` observed '' value which is computed using projected distances , in spite of the large error bars . a false positive might be recorded when a galaxy that is not the bcg appears to be close to the center , but is merely aligned with it .",
    "these projection effects should become more common as the number of galaxies increases , which explains why this problem is found only in high - mass clusters .",
    "however , the same problem should appear in lower - mass bins if the detection limit of galaxies is shifted to lower luminosities .",
    "this brings us to the second effect .",
    "the total number of galaxies observed in each cluster will depend on the detection limit .",
    "if this limit is lower , more galaxies will be detected , and the odds that one of them will be closer to the center than the bcg ( either in 3d on in projection ) will increase .",
    "for this reason , any value of @xmath8 determined from observations should be taken as a lower limit , owing to the fact that we might be missing faint galaxies located near the center . to illustrate this , we focus on one particular cluster in our simulation , cluster c03 .",
    "this is the third most massive cluster in our simulation , with a total mass @xmath80 .",
    "figure  [ dist_allgal ] shows the masses and projected distances to the center for all galaxies in the cluster . , which explains the horizontal alignment seen in the bottom of the figure .",
    "the solid circle and the vertical line indicate the bcg and its projected distance to the center , respectively .",
    "the horizontal dotted line indicates the detection limit we used to determine @xmath8 . above that line ,",
    "all galaxies are located at distances larger than the bcg , hence this clusters is identified as one for which the bcg is the closest to the center , and therefore this cluster does not contribute to the value of @xmath8 .",
    "but if the detection limit is slightly lowered , then a low - mass galaxy , indicated by a cross , suddenly becomes visible , and the bcg is no longer the closest galaxy to the center .",
    "this could explain the discrepancy between our values of @xmath8 and the ones reported by @xcite , if their low - mass clusters contain large numbers of low - mass galaxies , but this is unlikely since most of the clusters in their sample contain 5 galaxies or fewer ( see their figure  1 ) .",
    "finally , there is a third effect : the uncertainty in determining the location of the center .",
    "this location is always approximate , whether it is determined from observations or from a simulation .",
    "observations are limited by projection effects , detection limits , poor sampling ( having too few observed galaxies in the cluster ) , or in the case of dynamical estimates , only having the radial component of the velocities .",
    "simulations have their own problems : clusters do not have sharp edges , and tend to blend into filaments and larger structures .",
    "an algorithm for identifying clusters , like the friends - of - friends algorithm , must use a particular value for the linking length , and it is this particular value which sets , somehow arbitrarily , the edges of the clusters . for these reasons , we can never be sure which galaxy is the closest to the center if the differences in distances are very small .",
    "we actually use this limitation to justify the resolution of our simulation .",
    "the _ physical _ length resolution is of order @xmath81 at @xmath82 and @xmath51 at @xmath2 .",
    "we do not think that the location of clusters s centers could be determined with a precision better than that . also , the location of the center depends on the method used for estimating it .",
    "we use the center of mass of the cluster , but we also tried using the galaxies only , as in @xcite . for high - mass clusters , the differences were of order the resolution length of the algorithm or less ; for low - mass clusters , the number of galaxies was too small to allow a reliable determination of the center .",
    "for all clusters .",
    "solid lines : @xmath83 ; dotted lines : @xmath84;,width=480 ]    according to the central galaxy paradigm , the bcg should be at rest relative to the cluster .",
    "following @xcite , we calculate the difference in radial velocity between the bcg and the cluster itself .",
    "we assume that the observer is located in the @xmath85 direction , at a distance significantly larger than the size of the cluster .",
    "hence , the @xmath86-component can be taken as the radial component .",
    "the velocity difference is then given by @xmath87    using this , we calculate the ratio @xmath9 , where @xmath11 is the 1d velocity dispersion . @xmath88 and @xmath11 are calculated using @xmath89    where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the mass and the @xmath86-component of the velocity of particle @xmath92 .",
    "two different approaches can be used to estimate @xmath88 and @xmath11 for a given cluster : we can include only the galaxy particles in the sums .",
    "this corresponds to what an observer would do .",
    "or we can use all particles : galaxies , dark matter , and tidal fragments . here",
    "we use both approaches .",

    "it is interesting to notice that both methods tend to give similar results .",
    "a case in point is cluster c14 , for which the variations in @xmath9 with redshift are perfectly in phase . comparing this figure with the open circles in figure  [ dist ]",
    ", we find in several cases an _ anticorrelation _ :",
    "@xmath9 increases when the projected distance to the center decreases , and vice - versa .",
    "the most spectacular case is cluster c12 at @xmath108 , but notice also cluster c01 between @xmath109 and @xmath110 , cluster c04 between @xmath111 and @xmath59 , and several others .",
    "this anticorrelation could be a signature of non - equilibrium .",
    "if the bcg is moving back and forth inside the cluster , then the velocity is maximum when the bcg goes through the equilibrium position , and minimum when the bcg is the farthest from the equilibrium position ( like an oscillating pendulum ) .",
    "notice that we are comparing radial velocities with projected distances .",
    "hence , this explanation is appropriate for a back - and - forth motion , but would not be appropriate for an orbital motion .",
    "using a cosmological n - body simulation combined with a sub - grid treatment of galaxy formation , merging , and tidal destruction , we simulated the evolution of the galaxy and cluster population in a comoving volume of size @xmath15 , in a @xmath1cdm universe . in the final sate of the simulation , at @xmath2 , we identified 1788 clusters , including 18 massive ones ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we then investigated the location and velocity of the bcg in each cluster , in order to test the validity of the central galaxy paradigm .",
    "the fraction @xmath8 of clusters for which the bcg is not the closest galaxy to the center increases with cluster mass . the same trend is seen in the results of @xcite and in the prediction of the semi - analytical models . furthermore , our results , within error bars , match the results of @xcite at the high - mass end .",
    "however , at the low - mass end , our results predict that @xmath8 decreases , in agreement with the semi - analytical models , but not with the results of @xcite , which predict a plateau at @xmath112 .",
    "we agree with the general conclusion of @xcite that many bcgs do not reside at the center if their host cluster .",
    "however , we found that @xmath8 is not a very robust statistics .",
    "its determination is affected by projection effects , which may lead to an overestimate of @xmath8 , and selections effects , which may lead to an underestimate of @xmath8 .",
    "uncertainties in the determination of the center of the clusters can also be a problem .",
    "we also calculated the ratio @xmath9 .",
    "this is a more robust statistics , since it is not affected by projection effects , and weakly affected by selection effects through the estimation of @xmath11 .",
    "the distributions of @xmath9 extend from 0 to 1.8 , and are very skewed toward low values .",
    "the median values of @xmath9 are in the range 0.030.08 , significantly lower than the value 0.32 reported by @xcite . however ,",
    "when we consider only clusters with masses @xmath93 , the distributions become wider , and the median values raise to 0.15 at @xmath2 and 0.28 at @xmath71 .",
    "this indicates that low - mass clusters and nearby clusters , are more likely to be in equilibrium than high - mass ones or distant ones .",
    "we selected the 18 most massive clusters in our simulation , with masses @xmath93 , and performed a detailed study of the history of their formation , focussing on the period @xmath82 to @xmath2 ( that is , the last 9.4 gyrs ) .",
    "for each cluster , we built a merger tree , and followed the location and velocity of the bcg along the main family line of each cluster .",
    "a general pattern emerges .",
    "the brightest galaxy is initially the closest to the center of the cluster , and remains the closest until the cluster experiences a major or semi - major merger with another cluster of comparable mass . immediately after that merger ,",
    "the brightest galaxy can find itself at one mpc or even more from the center of the new cluster , and in this case is no longer the closest to the center .",
    "however , the new cluster , immediately after the merger , is out of equilibrium . during the time it takes for the cluster to reach equilibrium",
    ", the brightest galaxy migrates toward the center , until it finds itself the closets to the center again .",
    "the whole situation can be described in terms of two sets of timescales .",
    "first , we have the timescale for the clusters to form by the merger of smaller progenitors , versus the timescale for galaxies to form inside these progenitors . if the former timescale is the shorter one , which is the basic assumption behind the central galaxy paradigm , then the galaxies will form inside a system in equilibrium , and the bcg will settle at rest at the center of the cluster .",
    "but if the latter timescale is the shorter one , the galaxy destined to become the bcg is already present in one of the progenitor .",
    "the second set of timescales then comes into play : the timescale for the cluster to reach equilibrium after a major or semi - major merger , versus the timescale between such mergers .",
    "if the former timescale is the shorter one , then the cluster will reach equilibrium at @xmath2 , after the last merger .",
    "but if the latter timescale is the shorter one , then the cluster will be constantly disturbed by mergers , will never have sufficient time to reach equilibrium , and therefore will still be out of equilibrium at @xmath2 .",
    "these two limits are illustrated by the solid and open circles , respectively , in figure  [ last ] .",
    "we conclude that brightest galaxies not being at the center of their host clusters , and having large velocities , is a transient phenomenon , closely associated to major mergers between clusters . if the last major merger took place at large redshift , @xmath113 ( or if no such merger ever took place ) , the cluster has time to reach equilibrium before the present .",
    "but if the last major merger took place recently , the cluster will still be out of equilibrium at @xmath2 .",
    "this explains why @xmath8 increases with cluster mass : low - mass clusters are the ones that have not experienced any major merger in their recent history .",
    "they formed at high redshift , and were `` left alone '' until the present , giving them time to reach equilibrium .",
    "all calculations were performed at the laboratoire dastrophysique numrique , universit laval .",
    "this work benefited from stimulating discussions with benoit ct , roger coziol , heinz andernach , cesar augusto caretta , an anonymous referee , and especially ramin skibba , who also provided some of the data plotted in figure  [ fbnc ] .",
