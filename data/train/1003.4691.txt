    "ring galaxies are dramatic examples of galaxy transformation caused by a remarkably simple interaction .",
    "observations and numerical models ( @xcite ) argue persuasively that these objects are formed by the near central passage of a companion through a spiral along the rotation axis .",
    "the brief additional gravitational force induces epicyclic motions throughout the disk , which act to form radially propagating orbit - crowded rings of gas and stars .",
    "the concentration of the ism into the expanding ring ( at the disk s expense ) is nearly total and can last for @xmath0 myrs .",
    "it is this radical rearrangement of the spiral s ism that is responsible for their interesting star forming properties .",
    "star formation rates ( @xmath1 ) in ring galaxies are typically @xmath2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , i.e. , somewhat enhanced over large spirals but far below the @xmath1s inferred in lirgs ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the _ distribution _ of star formation is unique , being completely restricted to the expanding rings while simultaneously extinguished over the interior disk .",
    "both effects are evident in the lindsay - shapley ring ( _ l - s _ , hereafter ) and cartwheel , shown in figure 1 .",
    "a weak nuclear source is responsible for @xmath5 of the star formation in both .",
    "the star forming rings are narrow , with slices showing very sharp radial cutoffs in h@xmath6 emission .",
    "this implies that ob stars remain in the rings for their main sequence lifetimes , which constrains the stellar velocity dispersion of the rings : @xmath7 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the weak line emission that is sometimes found in ring galaxy disks is _ post_-starburst in origin , i.e. , arising from aging hii complexes powered by a - stars .",
    "_ l - s _ and cartwheel have been mapped in hi ( figure 1 ) . in such large systems",
    "@xmath8 of the atomic ism is concentrated in the rings , resulting in high hi surface densities : @xmath9 m@xmath3 pc@xmath10 . at the same time , their interiors are very gas poor , with @xmath11 m@xmath3 pc@xmath10 .",
    "hi line - widths are typically narrow ( @xmath12 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "kinematic analysis of the hi yields the ring s expansion speed ( @xmath13 ) , and thus an estimate of the ring galaxy s age ( @xmath14 ) . from their measured radii and @xmath13 ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 km s@xmath4 , respectively ) , the rings in cartwheel and _ l - s _",
    "are @xmath17 and @xmath18 myrs old ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath1 in ring galaxies correlates with their peak @xmath19 , which explains why young systems ( e.g. , ngc  2793 with @xmath20 myr ) have such low @xmath1 : they are still organizing their ism into a dense ring",
    ".      stars form in cold molecular gas , so hi data can only tell part of the story .",
    "ring galaxies are not very luminous in the rotational transitions of @xmath21co , a fact often attributed to reduced metallicities from snow - plowing outer disk gas into the ring ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however _",
    "l - s _ s ring possesses @xmath22solar abundances ( @xcite ) , which together with its large angular size , made it an ideal target for the @xmath23 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we observed 16 positions in _ l - s _ in @xmath21co(j=1 - 0 ) and @xmath21co(j=2 - 1 ) transitions : 14 on the ring and one each centered on the nucleus and enclosed disk .",
    "figure 2 shows co detections in 9/14 ring positions , defining two molecular arcs in the ring s north and southwest . the latter coincides with the galaxy s peak @xmath19 and @xmath24 .    _ l - s _ s ring is dominated by _",
    "atomic _ rather than molecular gas . for a galactic i@xmath25-n@xmath26",
    ", we find m@xmath26/m@xmath27 .",
    "astonishingly , a typical dwarf galaxy has nearly as much h@xmath28 as _ l - s _ s ring ( @xcite ) .",
    "the molecular gas fraction ( @xmath29 ) varies considerably around the ring , and is lowest in the ring s southwest quadrant ( @xmath30 at p9-p11 ) , where both @xmath19 and @xmath24 peak .",
    "the @xmath21co and hi line profiles in _",
    "l - s _ s ring can be extremely broad ( @xmath31 km s@xmath4 ) , with multiple velocity components or broad tails evident .",
    "it is not clear if this represents out - of - plane gas motions or caustics , though preliminary numerical models suggest the latter ( j. wallin , private communication ) .",
    "the onset of robust star formation in gas disks can be described in terms of local gravitational stability parameters , e.g. , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the gas velocity dispersion and @xmath34 is the disk s epicyclic frequency ( @xcite ) .",
    "regions of the disk where @xmath35 are jeans unstable and prone to collapse , leading to the formation of molecular cloud complexes and eventually stars .",
    "the `` bead on a string '' morphology evident in h@xmath6 ( figure 1 ) suggests that the rings are gravitationally unstable .",
    "are they ?",
    "the cartwheel s ring is , even ignoring its ( unknown ) molecular component .",
    "however , @xmath36 essentially everywhere in _ l - s_a ring ( figure 3 ) , due to the large @xmath37 .",
    "this ignores , however , the stellar component s contribution to @xmath38 . using irac 4.5 @xmath39 m data",
    "we find that the stellar mass surface density ( @xmath40 ) everywhere exceeds that of gas ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) .",
    "a gravitational stability parameter combining stars and gas can be written @xmath42 ( @xcite ) , where the ring s radial h@xmath6 profile constrains @xmath43 km s@xmath4 .",
    "figure 3 shows that when the stellar component is included , @xmath44 and _ l - s _ s ring is everywhere jeans unstable .",
    "conversely , the interior disks in both satisfy @xmath45 , i.e. , these regions are stable against the growth of gravitational instabilities and star formation is effectively quenched .",
    "a strong correlation exists between @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) and the surface density of cold gas in galaxies , i.e. , the `` schmidt law '' , written @xmath48 . in m  51",
    "for example , h@xmath28 and @xmath46 obey @xmath49 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "hi is uncorrelated with @xmath47 , implying that it is a photo - dissociation product and not directly involved in the star formation process .",
    "we show star formation laws derived for the cartwheel and _ l - s _ in the same figure . both are peculiar .",
    "unlike m  51 , atomic gas in the cartwheel correlates with @xmath47 in most of the ring , though with a small @xmath50 .",
    "the exponent becomes negative ( i.e. , _",
    "anti_-correlated ) where @xmath47 peaks .",
    "would this peculiarity disappear if the molecular component were available ?",
    "l - s _ s ring is any guide : atomic gas obeys m  51 s _ molecular _ schmidt law , but its cold molecular ism is _ uncorrelated _ with @xmath47 , which is completely the opposite from m  51 . how can h@xmath28 be so apparently disconnected from star formation ?",
    "star formation efficiency ( @xmath51 ) is the yield of massive stars per unit h@xmath28 mass .",
    "@xcite find nearly constant @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) ) from s0 to scd ( @xmath53 l@xmath3/m@xmath3 ) .",
    "later types show higher @xmath51 , peaking at @xmath54 l@xmath3/m@xmath3 for irr . detecting molecular gas in _",
    "l - s _ s ring allows the first estimate of @xmath51 in a ring galaxy .",
    "we find @xmath55 l@xmath3/m@xmath3 , i.e. , similar to an irr and an order of magnitude higher than the ( presumably @xmath56sa ) progenitor .",
    "this result depends , of course , on our ability to reliably measure h@xmath28 in the ring using @xmath21co emission .",
    "the rings are gas rich but seemingly h@xmath28 poor .",
    "since hi rapidly converts into h@xmath28 , the low @xmath57 can not signal the consumption of the molecular gas reservoir . nor can metallicity effects by themselves be responsible , at least in _ l - s_. the gas phase pressure ( @xmath58 ) might be a factor , as it directly affects the hi to h@xmath59 conversion rate .",
    "@xcite finds @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the ambient uv - field . for _ l - s _ s ring we estimated @xmath61 with spitzer and galex images , and @xmath62 , with the ring s stellar surface mass density derived with irac 4.5 @xmath39 m data .",
    "we find very high gas phase pressures , with @xmath63 , leading us to expect @xmath64 everywhere . _",
    "l - s _ s ring should be dominated by molecular gas . why is nt it ?",
    "we used photo - dissociation models in @xcite to estimate average gas volume densities ( @xmath65 ) in _ l - s _ s ring given its @xmath19 and uv - field . in the northern half of the ring , @xmath66 @xmath67 , implying an ism dominated by the _ cold neutral medium _ ( _ cnm _ , @xmath68 k ) , i.e. , the precursor of cold molecular clouds . in the southwest , where @xmath47 and @xmath19 are both much higher , the models give @xmath69 @xmath67 , which taken at face value , points to an ism dominated by the",
    "_ warm neutral medium _",
    "( _ wnm _ , @xmath70 k ) .",
    "how can you form stars out of this ?",
    "we believe the answer lies in fundamental differences in the environments of rings and spiral arms .",
    "consider that molecular clouds spend @xmath71 myrs in the arms of grand design spirals like m  51 , whereas the ism is confined in rings , equally as dense and actively forming stars , for @xmath72 myr .",
    "while molecular cloud growth is enhanced in the high @xmath73 rings , the destructive effects of sne and ob stars are also amplified .",
    "a dominant _ wnm _ might be expected as the molecular clouds become fragmented and `` over - cooked '' by shocks and sustained uv - fields .",
    "co might in this case retreat to the inner - most cloud cores resulting in weak @xmath74 and underestimates of @xmath75 .",
    "this might explain the peculiar schmidt laws and enhanced @xmath51 .",
    "at the same time , higher cloud collision rates might favor the formation of unusually large molecular cloud complexes and more efficient star formation .",
    "more work remains though results from cartwheel and _ l - s _ are intriguing .",
    "the distribution and gravitational stability of a ring galaxy s ism changes dramatically as it evolves .",
    "further , the long confinement in the dense star forming ring is expected result in a fragmented and largely atomic ism , which may explain the peculiar star formation laws , efficiencies , and @xmath57 observed in the two largest and most evolved ring galaxies , cartwheel and _ l - s_. future progress will require sensitive and high resolution assays of the molecular ism in these and other ring galaxies , which will be possible with alma and carma ."
