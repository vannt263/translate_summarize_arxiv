    "birkhoff initiated the mathematical theory of convex plane billiards .",
    "his main interest was in estimating the number of periodic billiard trajectories .",
    "he has pioneered the use of topological methods , based on the variational reduction and using the critical point theory .",
    "periodic trajectories in convex billiards in euclidean spaces of dimension @xmath8 were studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the high - dimensional problem also allows approach based on the critical point theory , and the main difficulty lies in more complicated topology of the appropriate configuration space .",
    "thus , the major effort of @xcite was in computing the cohomology algebra of the cyclic configuration space of the sphere .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to strengthen the estimates obtained in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will obtain linear in @xmath5 estimates on the number of @xmath5-periodic billiard trajectories , improving the logarithmic estimates of @xcite . on the other hand , in this work we will study a larger variety of billiard problems : besides the periodic trajectories we will be also interested in the number of ways the billiard ball can be brought from a given initial point to a given final point after making a prescribed number @xmath5 of reflections at the boundary of the billiard domain .",
    "let @xmath9 be a closed smooth strictly convex hypersurface .",
    "the @xmath10-dimensional convex body @xmath2 , bounded by @xmath6 will serve as our billiard table .",
    "the billiard ball is a point which moves in @xmath2 in a straight line , except when it hits @xmath11 , where it rebounds making the angle of incidence equal the angle of reflection . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath12 are three subsequent reflection points then the normal to @xmath6 at point @xmath13 bisects the angle between the vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we will consider the following billiard problems .    * problem a : * _ given two distinct points @xmath16 and a number @xmath5 , estimate the number of billiard trajectories inside @xmath6 which start at point a , end at point @xmath13 and make @xmath5 reflections at the hypersurface @xmath6 .",
    "_    * problem b : * _ estimate the number of billiard trajectories inside @xmath6 , which start and end at a given point @xmath3 and make a prescribed number @xmath5 of reflections at the hypersurface @xmath6 . _    problem b deals with closed billiard trajectories .",
    "it is clear that any closed billiard trajectory starting and ending at @xmath3 determines another closed billiard trajectory which is obtained by passing the same route in the reverse order .",
    "this explains that there is a natural @xmath17-action on the set of closed billiard trajectories , and in problem b one actually asks about _ the number of @xmath17-orbits _ of closed billiard trajectories .",
    "using this @xmath17-symmetry we will give a better estimate for problem b than the estimate for problem a given by theorem [ thm1 ] below .",
    "* problem c : * _ estimate the number of @xmath5-periodic billiard trajectories inside the billiard domain @xmath2 .",

    "any billiard trajectory @xmath28 must lie in a 2-plane passing through the center of the sphere @xmath29 .",
    "if the endpoints @xmath30 are distinct and not antipodal then there is a unique 2-plane passing through @xmath30 and @xmath29 ; the circle @xmath31 , the intersection of this 2-plane with @xmath7 , must contain all the reflection points @xmath32 .",
    "fix an orientation on @xmath31 and let @xmath33 be the angle from @xmath21 to @xmath13 .",
    "then the angle between @xmath34 and @xmath35 must be independent of @xmath36 and may take the values @xmath37 hence , we see that in this example there exist precisely @xmath22 billiard trajectories starting at @xmath21 , ending at @xmath13 and making @xmath5 reflections .",
    "this example shows that the statement of theorem [ thm1 ] for the generic case and for @xmath23 odd can not be improved .",
    "it looks reasonable to conjecture that for even @xmath23 the lower bound on the number of billiard trajectories is also @xmath22 .",

    "in this section we will use the variational method of g. birkhoff to show that the problem of estimating the number of billiard trajectories can be reduced to a topological problem of estimating the lusternik - schnirelman category of a space of configurations of @xmath5 points on the sphere @xmath7 .",
