    "compartmental epidemic models have been considered widely in the mathematical literature since the pioneering works of kermack , mckendrick and many others .",
    "investigating fundamental properties of the models with analytical tools allows us to get insight into the spread and control of the disease by gaining information about the solutions of the corresponding system of differential equations .",
    "determining steady states of the system and knowing their stability is of particular interest if one thinks of the long term behavior of the solution as final epidemic outcome .",
    "+ in the great majority of the deterministic models for communicable diseases , two steady states exist : one disease free , meaning that the disease is not present in the population , and the other one is endemic , when the infection persists with a positive state in some of the infected compartments .",
    "in such situation the basic reproduction number ( @xmath0 ) usually works as a threshold for the stability of fixed points : typically the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable whenever this quantity , defined as the number of secondary cases generated by an index infected individual who was introduced into a completely susceptible population , is less than unity , and for values of @xmath0 greater than one , the endemic fixed point emerging at @xmath1 takes stability over by making the disease free state unstable .",
    "this phenomenon , known as forward bifurcation at @xmath1 , is in contrary to some other cases when more than two equilibria coexist in certain parameter regions .",
    "backward bifurcation presents such a scenario , when there is an interval for values of @xmath0 to the left of one where there is a stable and an unstable endemic fixed point besides the unique disease free equilibrium .",
    "such dynamical structure of fixed points has been observed is several biological models considering multiple groups with asymmetry between groups and multiple interaction mechanisms ( for an overview see , for instance , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "however , examples can also be found in the literature where the coexistence of multiple non - trivial steady states is not due to backward transcritical bifurcation of the disease free equilibrium ; in the age - structured sir model analyzed by franceschetti _",
    "@xcite endemic equilibria arise through two saddle - node bifurcations of a positive fixed point , moreover wang @xcite found backward bifurcation from an endemic equilibrium in a simple sir model with treatment . + in case of forward transcritical bifurcation , the classical disease control policy can be formulated : the stability of the endemic state typically accompanied with the persistence of the disease in the population as long as the reproduction number is larger than one , while controlling the epidemic in a way such that @xmath0 decreases below one successfully eliminates the infection , since every solution converges to the disease free equilibrium when @xmath0 is less than unity . on the other hand , the presence of backward bifurcation with a stable non - trivial fixed point for @xmath2 means that bringing the reproduction number below one is only necessary but not sufficient for disease eradication .",
    "nevertheless , multiple endemic equilibria have further epidemiological implications , namely that stability and global behavior of the models that exhibit such structure are often not easy to analyze , henceforth little can be known about the final outcome of the epidemic .",
    "+    multi - city epidemic models , where the population is distributed in space over several discrete geographical regions with the possibility of individuals mobility between them , provide another example for rich dynamics . in the special case when the cities are disconnected the model possesses numerous steady states , the product of the numbers of equilibria in the one - patch models corresponding to each city . however , the introduction of traveling has a significant impact on steady states , as it often causes substantial technical difficulties in the fixed point analysis and , more importantly , makes certain equilibria disappear . some works in the literature deal with models where",
    "the system with traveling exhibits only two steady states , one disease free with the infection not being present in any of the regions , and another one , which exists only for @xmath3 , corresponding to the situation when the disease is endemic in each region ( see , for instance , arino @xcite , arino and van den driessche @xcite ) . other studies which consider the spatial dispersal of infecteds between regions ( gao and ruan @xcite , wang and zhao @xcite and the references therein ) do nt derive the exact number for the steady states but show the global stability of a single disease free fixed point for @xmath2 and claim the uniform persistence of the disease for @xmath3 with proving the existence of at least one ( componentwise ) positive equilibrium .",
    "+ the purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of individuals mobility on the number of equilibria in multiregional epidemic models .",
    "a general deterministic model is formulated to describe the spread of infectious diseases with horizontal transmission .",
    "the framework enables us to consider models with multiple susceptible , infected and removed compartments , and more significantly , with several steady states .",
    "the model can be extended to an arbitrary number of regions connected by instantaneous travel , and we investigate how mobility creates or destroys equilibria in the system .",
    "first we determine the exact number of steady states for the model in disconnected regions , then give a precise condition in terms of the reproduction numbers of the regions and the connecting network for the persistence of equilibria in the system with traveling .",
    "the possibilities for a three patch scenario with backward bifurcations ( i.e. , when two endemic states are present for local reproduction numbers less than one ) are sketched in figure [ fig : schematic ] ( cf .",
    "corollary [ cor : summaryee ] ) .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a general class of compartmental epidemic models is presented in section [ sec : model ] , including multigroup , multistrain and stage progression models .",
    "we consider @xmath4 regions which are connected by means of movement between the subpopulations and use our setting as a model building block in each region .",
    "section [ sec : dfe ] concerns with the unique disease free equilibrium of the multiregional system with small volumes of mobility , whilst in sections [ sec : ee ] , [ sec : irred ] and [ sec : nodirect ] we consider the endemic steady states of the disconnected system and specify conditions on the connection network and the model equations for the persistence of fixed points in the system with traveling .",
    "we finish sections [ sec : ee]-[sec : nodirect ] with corollaries that summarize the achievements .",
    "the results are applied to a model for hiv transmission in three regions with various types of connecting networks in section [ sec : hiv ] , then this model is used for the numerical simulations of section [ sec : richdyn ] to give insight into the interesting dynamics with multiple stable endemic equilibria , caused by the possibility of traveling .",
    "we consider an arbitrary ( @xmath4 ) number of regions , and use upper index to denote region @xmath5 , @xmath6 . let @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the set of infected , susceptible and removed ( by means of immunity or recovery ) compartments , respectively , for @xmath10 .",
    "the vectors @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are functions of time @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that all individuals are born susceptible , the continuous function @xmath15 models recruitment and also death of susceptible members .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath16 is @xmath17 times continuously differentiable .",
    "the @xmath18 matrix @xmath19 describes the transitions between infected classes as well as removals from infected states through death and recovery .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that all non - diagonal entries of @xmath20 are non - positive , that is , @xmath20 has the z sign pattern @xcite ; moreover the sum of the components of @xmath21 should also be nonnegative for any @xmath22 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that for such a matrix it holds that it is a non - singular m - matrix , moreover @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore we let @xmath24 be a @xmath25 diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries denote the removal rate in the corresponding removed class .",
    "+ disease transmission is described by the @xmath26 matrix function @xmath27 , assumed @xmath28 on @xmath29 , an element @xmath30 represents transmission between the @xmath31th susceptible class and the @xmath32th infected compartment .",
    "the term @xmath33 thus has the form @xmath34 , @xmath35 . for each pair @xmath36",
    "we define a non - negative @xmath37-vector @xmath38 which distributes the term @xmath39 into the infected compartments ; it necessarily holds that @xmath40 .",
    "henceforth individuals who enter the @xmath41-th infected class when turning infected are represented by @xmath42 , which allows us to interpret the inflow of newly infected individuals into @xmath11 as @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "recovery of members of the @xmath32th disease compartment into the @xmath31th removed class is denoted by the @xmath46-th entry of the @xmath47 nonnegative matrix @xmath48 .",
    "+ in case of disconnected regions we can formulate the equations describing disease dynamics in region @xmath5 , @xmath6 , as @xmath49 due to its general formulation our system is applicable to describe a broad variety of epidemiological models in the literature .",
    "this is illustrated with some simple examples .",
    "multigroup models    epidemiological models where , based on individual behavior , multiple homogeneous subpopulations ( groups ) are distinguished in the heterogeneous population are often called multigroup models .",
    "the different individual behavior is typically reflected in the incidence function as , for instance , by sexually transmitted diseases the probability of becoming infected depends on the number of contacts the individual makes , which is closely related to his / her sexual behavior . in terms of our system ( [ basismodel ] ) , such a model is realized if @xmath50 holds and the vector @xmath51 is defined as its @xmath31th component is one with all other elements zero , meaning that individuals who are in the @xmath31th susceptible group go into the @xmath31th infected class when contracting the disease . a simple sir - type model with constant recruitment @xmath52 into the @xmath41th susceptible class , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 as natural mortality rate of the @xmath41th subpopulation and recovery rate of individuals in @xmath55 , @xmath56 , becomes a multigroup model if its ode system reads @xmath57 see also the classical work of hethcote and ark @xcite for epidemic spread in heterogeneous populations .",
    "stage progression models    these models are designed to describe the spread of infectious diseases where all newly infected individuals arrive to the same compartment and then progress through several infected stages until they recover or die .",
    "if we let @xmath58 for every @xmath36 then ( [ basismodel ] ) becomes a stage progression model .",
    "the example @xmath59 provides such a framework with one susceptible and one removed class . the more general model presented by hyman _",
    "_ in @xcite considers different infected compartments to represent the phenomenon of changing transmission potential throughout the course of the infectious period .",
    "multistrain models    considering more than one infected class in an epidemic model might be necessary because of the coexistence of multiple disease strains .",
    "individuals infected by different subtypes of pathogen belong to different disease compartments , and a new infection induced by a strain always arises in the corresponding infected class . using the interpretation of @xmath60 in ( [ basismodel ] ) this can be modeled with the choice of @xmath61 , @xmath35 , @xmath62 , however it is not hard to see that the model described by the system @xmath63 also exhibits such a structure .",
    "van den driessche and wathmough refer to several works for multistrain models in section 4.4 in @xcite , and they also provide a system with two strains and one susceptible class as an example ; though we point out that their model incorporate the possibility of `` super - infection '' which is not considered in our framework .    after describing our general disease transmission model in @xmath4 separated territories",
    "we connect the regions by means of traveling with the assumptions that travel occurs instantaneously .",
    "we denote the matrices of movement rates from region @xmath41 to region @xmath5 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , of infected , susceptible and removed individuals by @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , which have the form @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where all entries are nonnegative . for connected regions , our model in region",

    "we also suppose that all eigenvalues of the derivative @xmath82 have negative real part , which establishes the local asymptotic stability of @xmath83 in the disease free system @xmath84 when system ( [ basismodel ] ) is close to the disease free equilibrium , the dynamics in the infected classes can be approximated by the linear equation @xmath85 where we use the notation @xmath86 .",
    "the transmission matrix @xmath87 represents the production of new infections while @xmath88 describes transition between and out of the infected classes .",
    "clearly @xmath87 is nonnegative , which together with @xmath23 implies the non - negativity of @xmath89 .",

    "it is clear that , with the help of theorems [ th : pluszeroro>1 ] and [ th : pluszeroro<1 ] , the number of fixed points in the disconnected system which persist with traveling can be easily determined for any given ( not necessarily irreducible ) connecting network .",

    "as pointed out in theorem [ th : dfehiv ] the unique disease free equilibrium always exists in @xmath125@xmath689 .    the existence of the unique disease free steady state is guaranteed by theorem [ th : dfehiv ] .",
    "the proof will be done in the following steps :    1 .",
    "we show that there is no travel network which results in the persistence of 13 - 17 or 19 - 26 equilibria .",
    "we prove that the system of three regions with traveling can not have 8 or 11 fixed points .",
    "we demonstrate through examples that all other numbers of equilibria up to 27 can be realized .",
    "step 1 : + we note that if either @xmath682 holds in any of the regions , or there are two or more regions where @xmath683 , then the number of fixed points does nt exceed 12 .",
    "thus , to have at least 13 equilibria there must be two regions @xmath710 with @xmath711 and @xmath712 . if the third region also has three fixed points , that is , @xmath713 then there is no region with local reproduction number greater than one , and thus theorem [ th : pluszeroro<1 ] yields the existence of 27 steady states . otherwise @xmath714 is greater than one and region @xmath715 has two equilibria , one disease free and one endemic .",
    "in this case by theorem [ th : iftendemic ] there are 9 fixed points where @xmath716 , all of which preserved for small volumes of traveling .",
    "the possible number of equilibria with @xmath717 , which exist with traveling , are one ( if @xmath715 is reachable from both regions ) , 3 ( if @xmath715 is reachable from only one of them ) and 9 ( if @xmath715 is unreachable ) .",
    "we conclude that there are only two values greater than 12 for the possible number of fixed points in the travel system , which are 18 and 27 .",
    "+ step 2 : + we distinguish 5 cases to consider :    a.   @xmath718 for @xmath692 ; b.   @xmath711 , @xmath712 , @xmath719 , @xmath720 ; c.   @xmath711 , @xmath721 , @xmath719 , @xmath720 ; d.   @xmath722 for @xmath692 ; e.   there is an @xmath397 such that @xmath723 , @xmath724 .    in case ( i )",

    "fixed points has been described in step 1 , and we use the case when @xmath739 and @xmath740 to construct examples for 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 steady states .",
    "figure [ fig:4567 ] depicts one possibility for the network of each case , though it is clear that there might be several ways to get the same number of equilibria .",
    "+ if both regions 2 and 3 are reachable from 1 , then fixed points where @xmath728 are preserved with traveling only if @xmath730 and @xmath716 also hold . on the top of these 2 positive equilibria , there surely exists the disease free steady state plus 1 , 2 or 3 non - zero fixed point(s ) with @xmath741 , depending on whether region 2 is reachable from 3 and vice versa , as illustrated in figure [ fig:4567 ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "if region 3 is reachable from both regions 1 and 2 then @xmath717 is only possible in the disease free equilibrium ; although all 6 fixed points where region 3 is at the endemic steady state persist for small volumes of traveling if there is no connection from 1 to 2 ( figure [ fig:4567 ] ( d ) shows such a situation ) .",
    "the dynamics of the hiv model in connected regions is worth investigating in more depth , although this is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "however the numerical simulations presented in the next section reveal some interesting behavior of the model .",
    "this section is devoted to illustrate the rich dynamical behavior in the model .",
    "the epidemiological consequence of the existence of multiple positive equilibria in one - patch models is that the epidemic can have various outcomes , because solutions with different initial values might converge to different steady states .",
    "stable fixed points are of particular interest as they usually attract solutions starting in the neighborhood of other ( unstable ) steady states . for instance , in case of backward bifurcation the presence of a stable positive equilibrium for @xmath742 makes it possible that the disease sustains itself even if the number of secondary cases generated by a single infected individual in a fully susceptible population is less than one",
    ". however , considering multiple patches with connections from one to another deeply influences local disease dynamics , since the travel of infected agents induces outbreaks in disease free regions .",
    "the inflow of infected individuals might change the limiting behavior when pushing a certain solution into the attracting region of a different steady state , and it also may modify the value of fixed points . + henceforth , knowing the stability of equilibria in the connected system of regions is of key importance . for small volumes of traveling not only the number of fixed points but also their stability can be determined : whenever a steady state of the disconnected regions continues to exists in the system with traveling by means of the implicit function theorem , its stability is not changed on a small interval of the mobility parameter @xmath124 .",
    "this means that equilibria of @xmath125@xmath126 , which have all @xmath4 components stable in the disconnected system , are stable ; although every steady state which contains an unstable fixed point as a component is unstable when @xmath136 and thus , also for small positive @xmath124 . in this paper",
    "the conditions for the persistence of steady states with the introduction of small  volume traveling has been described : by a continuous function of @xmath124 , all fixed points of @xmath106@xmath107 will exist in the connected system but those for which there is a dfat region with local reproduction number greater than one , and to which the connecting network establishes a connection from an eat territory .",
    "however , infection - free steady states are typically unstable for @xmath743 , thus the above argument yields that incorporating traveling with low volumes preserves all stable fixed points of the disconnected system , since the equilibria which disappear when @xmath124 exceeds zero are unstable .",
    "+ the dependence of the dynamics on movement is illustrated for the hiv model . to focus our attention to how @xmath124 influences the fixed points , their stability and the long time behavior of solutions",
    ", we let all model parameters but the local reproduction numbers in the three regions to be equal . in the figures which we present in the appendix , the evolution of four solutions with different initial conditions were investigated as @xmath124 increases from zero through small volumes to larger values .",
    "+ if all three regions exhibit backward bifurcation , and the local reproduction numbers are set such that besides the disease free fixed point , there are two positive equilibria @xmath673 , @xmath744 , then , as described in section [ sec : hiv ] , 27 steady states exist for small @xmath124-s . assuming that the conjectures of section [ sec : hiv ] about the stability of the disease free equilibrium and the steady state with @xmath745 , and the instability of the positive fixed point with @xmath746 hold in each region",
    ", we get that system @xmath125@xmath126 with hiv dynamics exhibits 8 stable and 19 unstable steady states on an interval for @xmath124 to the right of zero .",
    "this is confirmed by figures [ fig : hivrl1irred ] and [ fig : hivrl1red ] , where two cases of irreducible and reducible travel networks were considered ( see the appendix for more detailed description of the networks ) , and @xmath747 holds . introducing low volume traveling ( e.g. , letting @xmath748 in our examples ) effects neither the stability of steady states nor the limiting behavior of solutions , however the difference in the type of the connecting network manifests for larger movement rates , as the conditions for disease eradication clearly change along with the equilibrium values ( see figures [ fig : hivrl1irred ] and [ fig : hivrl1red ] ( c ) and ( d ) where @xmath124 were chosen as @xmath749 and @xmath750 , respectively ) .",
    "+ when there are regions with local reproduction numbers larger than one in the network , certain fixed points of the disconnected system disappear with the introduction of traveling ; this phenomenon is reasonably expected to have an impact on the final outcome of the epidemic . for all three networks used for the simulations in figures [ fig : hivrg1nofb ] , [ fig : hivrg1feedback ] and [ fig : hivrg1full ] , presented in the appendix , the number of infected individuals takes off in regions with @xmath751 for small @xmath124 , regardless of the initial conditions ( see figures ( b ) where @xmath748 and , in particular , the cases when @xmath752 ) .",
    "the results for larger travel volumes ( in the simulations the two settings of @xmath753 and @xmath750 were considered ) further support the conjecture that solutions converge to positive steady states in regions with reproduction number greater than one .",
    "however , the case when regions 2 and 3 , @xmath754 , are not reachable from each other and a single endemic equilibrium seems to attract all solutions ( illustrated in figure [ fig : hivrg1nofb ] ) is in contrary to the situation experienced in figure [ fig : hivrg1feedback ] , since we see that establishing a path from region 2 to 3 via region 1 results in the emergence of another positive ( possibly locally stable ) steady state in region 3 .",
    "nevertheless , comparing figures [ fig : hivrg1nofb ] and [ fig : hivrg1feedback ] with reducible networks to figure [ fig : hivrg1full ] , where a complete connecting network was considered , highlights the role of the irreducibility of the network on the dynamics .",
    "whereas in case of reducible networks , the final epidemic outcome in a region with @xmath610 strongly depends on initial conditions and connections to other regions , making each region reachable from another sustains the epidemic in region 1 ( where @xmath755 ) by giving rise to a single positive steady state of the system .",
    "this has an implication on the long term behavior of solutions in regions with @xmath609 as well , since direct connections seem to stabilize only one endemic equilibrium in region 2 and region 3 , and exclude the existence of other steady states .",
    "+ in summary , the theoretical analysis performed throughout the paper is in accordance with the numerical simulations for small values of the general mobility parameter @xmath124 , but more importantly , it provides full information about the fixed points of @xmath106@xmath107 : it determines their ( non-)persistence , along with their stability , in the system with traveling incorporated . on the other hand ,",
    "little is known about the solutions of the model when the travel volume is larger , as the structure of the connecting network and initial values deeply influence the dynamics .",
    "in this paper a general class of differential epidemic models with multiple susceptible , infected and removed compartments was considered .",
    "we provided examples of multigroup , multistrain and stage progression models to illustrate the broad range of applicability of our framework to describe the spread of infectious diseases in a population of individuals .",
    "the model setup allows us to investigate disease dynamics models with multiple endemic steady states .",
    "such models have been considered in various works in the literature including studies which deal with the phenomenon of backward bifurcation .",
    "we extended our framework to an arbitrary number of regions and incorporated the possibility of mobility of individuals ( e.g. , traveling ) between the regions into the model .",
    "motivated by well known multiregional models , where the exact number of steady states have not been explored , our aim in this work was to reveal the implication of mobility between the regions on the structure of equilibria in the system .",
    "+ we introduced a parameter @xmath124 to express the general mobility intensity , whilst differences in the connectedness of the regions were modeled by constants , each describing the relative connectivity of one territory to another .",
    "considering the model equations of the connected system as a function of the model variables and @xmath124 , the implicit function theorem enabled us to represent steady states as continuous functions of the mobility parameter .",
    "we showed that the unique disease free equilibrium of the disconnected system along with all componentwise positive fixed points continues to exist in the system with traveling for small @xmath124 , with their stability unchanged . on the other hand ,",
    "boundary equilibria of the system with no traveling ( this is , steady states with some regions without infection and others endemic for @xmath136 ) may disappear when @xmath124 becomes positive , as they might move out of the nonnegative cone along the continuous function established by means of the implicit function theorem , and thus , become no longer biologically meaningful .",
    "+ throughout the analysis performed in the paper we gave necessary and sufficient condition for the persistence of such equilibria in the system with traveling for various types of the connecting network .",
    "it turned out that the local reproduction numbers and the structure of the graph describing connections between the infected compartments of the regions play an important role . if each infected compartment is connected to every other infected class of the same type of other regions , implying that the connecting network includes every possible link , then a boundary equilibrium of the disconnected system wo nt persist with traveling if and only if there is a component of the fixed point corresponding to a disease free region with local reproduction number greater than one .",
    "assuming an extra condition on the infected subsystem in each region we showed that the same statement holds in the case when the connection network of infected classes is not complete but is still irreducible , meaning that each region is reachable from any other one via a series of links between any of the infected classes ",
    "see figure [ fig : directcon ] which illustrates such a situation .",
    "the result also extends to the most general case of arbitrary connection network of the infected classes : it was proved that steady states of the disconnected system which have a disease free region with @xmath743 disappear from the system if the possibility of mobility establishes a connection to this region ( maybe via several other regions ) from a territory where the disease is endemic ; nevertheless all other equilibria of the system without traveling continue to exist for small values of the mobility parameter @xmath124 .",
    "the epidemiological implication of this behavior is that , even for small volumes of traveling , all regions with local reproduction number greater than one will be invaded by the disease unless they are unreachable from endemic territories .",
    "direct or indirect connections from regions with positive disease state make the inflow of infecteds possible and then the imported cases spread the disease in the originally disease free region due to @xmath743 . + in the most common situation of forward transcritical bifurcation of the disease free equilibrium at @xmath756 ,",
    "when the disease can not be sustained for values of @xmath757 less than one , our results yield that only connections from regions with @xmath743 have impact on the equilibria of the disconnected system .",
    "if a region with local reproduction number greater than one is susceptible in the absence of traveling then isolating it from endemic territories keeps the region free of infection , so a successful intervention strategy can be to deny all connections from regions with @xmath743 .",
    "however , the dynamics becomes more complicated when small  volume traveling is incorporated into a system of multiple regions with some exhibiting the phenomenon of backward bifurcation : in a case when endemic equilibria exist for @xmath742 as well , protecting a region with @xmath743 from the disease by denying the entrance of individuals from areas where the reproduction number is greater than one is no longer sufficient ( though still necessary ) to prevent the outbreak .",
    "such a situation was illustrated by an hiv transmission model for three regions where , under certain conditions , the dynamics undergoes backward bifurcation in each region .",
    "we calculated the possible number of steady states of the disconnected system which persist with the introduction of traveling with small volumes into the system , and illustrated by several examples on the network structure and model parameter setting that mobility of individuals between the regions gives rise to various scenarios for the limiting behavior of solutions , and thus makes the outcome of the epidemic difficult to predict .",
