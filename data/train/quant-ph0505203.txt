    "typical atomic ion species for quantum information applications such as @xmath1be@xmath2 , @xmath3ca@xmath2 , and @xmath4cd@xmath2 have a single valence electron with a @xmath5 ground state and @xmath6 first excited electronic states . in isotopes with nonzero nuclear spin , the @xmath5 ground states are split by the hyperfine interaction .",
    "an applied static magnetic field @xmath7 provides a quantization axis and removes degeneracy in the ground state zeeman levels .",
    "two states , one from each ground state hyperfine level , are designated as the qubit states , denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 for each ion @xmath10 and separated by energy @xmath11 . at certain values of @xmath7",
    ", this energy splitting can be insensitive to magnetic field fluctuations to first order , forming a qubit that can have particularly good phase stability .",
    "such qubit levels are termed `` clock states '' because their stability is exploited in atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "the qubit frequency splitting @xmath12 is usually in the microwave range and large compared with the radiative line - width @xmath13 of excited electronic states , therefore the qubit can be measured with high fidelity by resonant pumping to a cycling transition between one hyperfine state and an excited electronic state @xcite .",
    "initialization of the qubits can also be accomplished with high accuracy using optical pumping techniques ( figure [ cap : qubit ] ) .",
    "we assume ions are confined in a linear paul trap @xcite with a combination of static and radio frequency ( rf ) electric quadrupole potentials @xcite .",
    "when the ions are sufficiently cold , their coulomb repulsion balances the external confinement forces , and the ions form stationary crystals with the residual motion described by coupled harmonic oscillatory motion in the trap .",
    "the number of collective modes scales linearly with the number of atoms @xmath14 in the trap , making it difficult to isolate and control all modes of oscillation for large numbers of ions . to circumvent this difficulty ,",
    "an architecture has been proposed for shuttling ions between multiple trap regions in a trap structure such that it is only necessary to localize a small number of ions at a given time @xcite .",
    "two - qubit quantum gates in addition to arbitrary single qubit rotations are sufficient for the engineering of arbitrarily complex entangled states @xcite , so we focus on the operation of quantum gates on @xmath15 ions , although extensions to larger numbers of ions is straightforward .",
    "the ions arrange themselves along the weakest ( @xmath16 ) axis of the confinement potential , and the position operator of each ion can be written as @xmath17 , with the operator @xmath18 describing the small quantum harmonic oscillations of each ion about its equilibrium position @xmath19 .",
    "of the six normal modes of oscillation for the two ions , only the two axial normal modes will be considered for simplicity ( see section 1.1 ) : the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath20 and a `` stretch '' coordinate @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the component of @xmath18 along the @xmath16-axis .",
    "the base hamiltonian for the collective system is @xmath23 where @xmath12 is the frequency difference between the two qubit states ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the frequencies associated with the center - of - mass and stretch modes , respectively ; and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are their respective harmonic oscillator creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian describes the internal energy of the ions , and the second term describes the external vibrational energy of the system .    single qubit rotations between hyperfine qubit levels ( not involving ion motion ) can be performed by applying appropriate radiation fields .",
    "for example , a resonant microwave field can directly couple the qubit levels through a magnetic dipole interaction , resulting in coherent rabi oscillations between the two qubit states .",
    "alternatively , optical stimulated - raman transitions can be employed @xcite , using two optical sources that coherently couple the qubit states through excited @xmath6 electronic states , as discussed next .",
    "an optical coupling between the hyperfine qubit states and an excited electronic state of each ion can be exploited to entangle qubit states with collective motional states , forming the backbone of most trapped ion quantum logic gates .",
    "as shown in figure [ cap : two_level ] , we assume each of two trapped ions consists of three levels : the two ground state qubit levels @xmath28 and @xmath29 and an excited electronic state @xmath30 having respective optical frequency spans @xmath31 and @xmath32 . two optical fields @xmath33 with @xmath34 and polarization @xmath35 , connect each of the qubit levels @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , to state @xmath30 through electric dipole operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 . we assume that the optical fields have a difference frequency @xmath38 and are both detuned from the excited - state resonance by @xmath39 , as drawn in figure [ cap : two_level ] .",
    "these fields evaluated at the ion s position @xmath40 are what ultimately couples the spin to the motion .",
    "the interaction can be transformed to a rotating frame at frequency @xmath41 in order to remove all terms varying with optical frequencies , and under the usual optical rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , the interaction hamiltonian between the fields and the ions is    @xmath42\\label{general_h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this expression , the dipole coupling strengths between qubit state @xmath43 and excited state @xmath30 from laser field @xmath44 on ion @xmath10 are given by @xmath45@xmath46@xmath47 .",
    "for most of the remainder of this paper ( outside of section 3 ) , we assume that the detuning @xmath48 of the optical fields from electronic resonance is much larger than the excited state line - width @xmath13 and the couplings @xmath49 , so that spontaneous emission during the optical coupling is negligible @xcite and the excited state @xmath30 can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "applying rwa on the microwave frequencies , we find    @xmath50\\label{adelim_h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the differences in the wave - vector and the phase of the two applied fields , @xmath53 is the `` base rabi frequency '' directly coupling the qubit states of ion @xmath10 , and @xmath54 corresponds to the ac stark shifts of the qubit level @xmath55 of ion @xmath10 by both optical fields .    for simplicity , we assume @xmath56 is parallel to the x - axis ( @xmath57 ) , so that the interaction deals only with axial motion ( although it is straightforward to treat the more general case ) .",
    "we substitute the x - component of the position operator @xmath58 for ion @xmath10 by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the root mean square spatial spread of the ground state wavepacket for normal mode @xmath61 of oscillation in the trap , @xmath62 is the single ion mass , and the plus ( minus ) sign refers to ion @xmath63 ( @xmath64 . in the interaction frame of the vibrational levels , equation [ adelim_h ] becomes @xmath65}e^{i(\\delta\\omega)t}e^{-i(\\delta kx_{0,i}-\\delta\\phi)}\\left|\\uparrow_{i}\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\downarrow_{i}\\right|+h.c.)\\nonumber \\\\",

    "the above treatment can be generalized to the case of multiple optical sources that connect both qubit states to any number of excited states , resulting in higher order expressions for @xmath68 and @xmath69 . here however , we are mainly interested in the sensitivity of entangling gate operations on the optical phases @xmath70 .",
    "the net optical phase appearing in the coupling hamiltonian ( equation [ adelim_h ] ) is sensitive only to the phase _ difference _ @xmath52 between the two optical fields , so that when both fields are generated from a single laser and modulator , fluctuations in the optical phase of the laser source become common mode and do not lead to decoherence @xcite .",
    "however , in order to couple the qubits with the motion for entangling quantum gates , the optical sources are generally non - copropagating ( @xmath71@xmath72 ) , opening up the sensitivity to decoherence from fluctuations in relative beam path lengths or ions positions through the phase factor @xmath73 .",
    "this requires interferometric stability between the optical paths of the fields @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which should be feasible over short times using stable optical mounts and indexing the laser beams to the trap structure itself .",
    "however , over the long time scale represented by an extended quantum computation , drifts in the phase @xmath73 can be a serious source of decoherence .",
    "equation [ adelim_h ] includes direct couplings between qubit states , and entangling couplings between qubit states and trapped ion motional states .",
    "we consider the case where the base rabi frequencies @xmath68 are much smaller than the vibrational frequencies @xmath76 of the ions in the trap . in this case , the difference frequency @xmath77 of the optical sources can be tuned to particular values so that a single stationary term emerges from the above hamiltonian , and all others couplings can be neglected under the rotating wave approximation .",
    "in this regime , as seen from the rest frame of the ions , the applied laser fields acquire resolved frequency - modulation sidebands from the ions harmonic vibration .",
    "we concentrate on three spectral features : the `` carrier '' , the first upper and lower sidebands , each selected by appropriate tuning of the radiation field difference frequency .      when the difference frequency between the optical sources is tuned to the free - ion qubit resonance ( compensating for possible differential stark shifts , assumed to be equal for the two ions ) , then @xmath78 ( figure [ cap : stimulated - raman - transition]a ) , and we find the stationary term in equation [ adelim_h ] is given by @xcite @xmath79 this `` carrier '' interaction describes simple rabi flopping between the qubit states in each ion , where the qubit raising and lowering operators are defined by @xmath80 and @xmath81 . also , @xmath82 is the debye - waller factor that exponentially suppresses the carrier coupling due to ion motion described by vibrational quantum numbers @xmath83 in each mode @xmath61 of motion , with @xmath84 being a laguerre polynomial of order @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "when the ions are confined to the lamb - dicke limit ( ldl ) where @xmath85 , then @xmath86 . however ,",
    "if the motion of either mode is not in a pure eigenstate of harmonic motion and outside of the ldl , then the rabi frequency will depend upon the noisy motional quantum state and lead to qubit decoherence . in order to avoid this problem ,",
    "carrier operations are often performed with copropagating raman beams ( @xmath87 ) thereby forcing @xmath88 . a carrier transition using a copropagating geometry",
    "can also be insensitive to the phase noise of the source laser , making it ideal for single qubit rotations .",
    "when the difference frequency between the optical sources is tuned lower than the free - atom qubit resonance by the vibrational frequency @xmath76 of mode @xmath61 ( again compensating for differential stark shifts ) , @xmath89 ( figure [ cap : stimulated - raman - transition]b ) and we find the stationary term in equation [ adelim_h ] is @xcite @xmath90 this  red sideband ",
    "interaction describes rabi flopping between the coupled qubit - motional states @xmath91 and @xmath92 in each ion , where @xmath93 is the debye - waller factor for the first sideband , with @xmath94 the `` spectator '' mode of motion . here , @xmath95 is an associated laguerre polynomial .",
    "this interaction is the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xcite where energy is exchanged between the internal qubit and the external harmonic oscillator states .",
    "when the difference frequency between the optical sources is tuned higher than the free - atom qubit resonance by the vibrational frequency @xmath76 of mode @xmath61 ( once again compensating for differential stark shifts ) , @xmath96 ( figure [ cap : stimulated - raman - transition]c ) and we find the stationary term in equation [ adelim_h ] is now @xcite@xmath97 this `` blue sideband '' or anti - jaynes - cummings interaction describes rabi flopping between the coupled qubit - motional states @xmath98 and @xmath99 in each ion .      the original cirac - zoller ( cz ) scheme @xcite illustrates how entanglement between trapped ion qubits can be achieved through coupling of each qubit to a common mode of motion in the trap .",
    "the cz scheme allows the operation of a controlled - not gate between two trapped ion qubits , flipping the state of a target qubit ( e.g. , @xmath100 ) only when the control qubit is , say , in state @xmath101 .",
    "this can be accomplished by cooling a collective motional mode @xmath61 of the two ions to the @xmath102 ground state and performing the following three steps :    \\(1 ) a carrier @xmath103-pulse on the target qubit with associated phase @xmath104 ,    \\(2 ) a @xmath105 phase gate on two ions    \\(3 ) a carrier @xmath106-pulse on the target qubit with phase @xmath104 ( step ( i ) reversed ) .",
    "steps ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) are simply carrier couplings on the target qubit ion , achieved by focusing radiation on the target ion only ( @xmath107 ) and applying the radiation for a time @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "step ( 1 ) results in the evolution @xmath110 step ( 3 ) is identical to step ( 1 ) except the phase is shifted by @xmath111 there are many ways to implement step ( 2 ) , one of which is : i ) a @xmath105-pulse blue sideband that maps the internal qubit state of the control qubit to the collective state of the ion pair , ii ) a @xmath112-pulse coupling the @xmath113 state exclusively to an auxiliary level , and iii ) a @xmath105-pulse on the blue sideband to map the collective motional state back to the control bit ( see figure [ cap : cirac - zoller ] ) .",
    "the net effect of these steps produces the following phase gate : @xmath114 here every state maintains a constant amplitude and the phase is well - defined .",
    "however , steps ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) contribute an additional phase to the controlled - not gate:@xmath115 the phase of the cirac - zoller controlled - not gate therefore depends solely on the phase of the @xmath103-pulse single qubit rotations . as mentioned in section 1.1 , the sensitivity of single qubit rotations to optical phase can be removed using copropagating raman beams requiring only a stable microwave source driving an optical modulator .",
    "this conversion between a phase gate and a controlled - not gate is extremely useful for many entangling gate schemes , since phase gates are more intuitive to construct and have an inherently well - defined phase .",
    "the cz model for trapped ion quantum logic gates has many drawbacks , including the need for individually addressing the ions with optical sources , and the requirement that the motion be prepared in a pure state of collective motion , usually through laser - cooling to the @xmath102 state . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we consider improved schemes for trapped ion quantum gates that do not have these requirements . in some cases",
    ", we will see that the sensitivity to the optical phase @xmath73 can also be suppressed .",
    "unlike the cirac - zoller gate where the internal qubit state of one ion is directly transferred to particular eigenstates of motion , entangling gates using spin - dependent forces coherently displace the initial motional state in the position / momentum phase space , a process through which each spin state can acquire an independent geometric phase@xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity in these phases can result in a final state that can no longer be separated into two independent qubit subspaces , thus entangling the internal states of the two ions .",
    "this produces a phase gate similar to the cirac - zoller scheme , which can then be converted to a controlled - not gate when combined with single qubit rotations .    in this section ,",
    "we focus on gates in the resolved - sideband limit where the interaction time is much longer than the trap period .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is proportional to @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the pauli spin matrix operating on the internal qubit states , and @xmath118 is a unit vector pointing in a particular direction on the bloch sphere for ion @xmath10 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath116 each experiences a different force from the interaction ( see figure [ cap : bloch spheres ] ) .",
    "the gates are categorized according to the direction of @xmath118 : in a `` @xmath119 gate '' , the differential force is applied via a differential ac stark shift on the states @xmath28 and @xmath29 induced by the laser fields @xcite . however , clock states exhibit no differential ac stark shift when the raman detuning @xmath48 is large compared to the qubit frequency splitting @xmath12 ( see appendix a ) , so the only available qubit states for a @xmath119 gate are thus susceptible to magnetic field fluctuations . in a `` @xmath120 gate '' ,",
    "optical fields driving spin flips and coupling to the motion produces a differential force between eigenstates of @xmath121 , where the unit vector @xmath122 lies on the equatorial plane of the bloch sphere@xcite . although this gate is compatible with clock states , the optical beam configuration can give rise to extreme sensitivity of the qubit phase on the optical phase of the driving field , which can be the limiting factor in the fidelity of the gate@xcite . in this section , we propose a method to cancel this phase dependence on the optical field , relaxing the constraint on long - term interferometric stability between the two raman beam paths for the entirety of a multi - gate sequence quantum algorithm .      in order to understand the spin - dependent force , we start by considering the effects when a force is applied to a harmonic oscillator . in general",
    ", a forced harmonic oscillator has a hamiltonian of the form @xcite @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the annihilation and creation operators respectively , and @xmath126 is the root mean square spatial spread of the ground state wavepacket .",
    "the first term is the unperturbed hamiltonian for the harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath127 , and the last two terms correspond to an external time - dependent force @xmath128 applied to the system . in the interaction picture",
    "@xmath129 assuming the force @xmath130 is detuned from resonance by frequency @xmath131 , then the interaction hamiltonian can be rewritten as@xmath132 the state after an interaction time @xmath133 is prescribed by the time - evolution operator @xmath134+ ... \\right)\\right\\ } .\\label{eq : evolution operator}\\ ] ]    if we consider only the first term in the exponent of the evolution operator and substituting in the interaction hamiltonian from equation [ eq : interaction picture 2 ] , the resulting operator is exactly the displacement operator @xmath135 with @xmath136 defined as @xmath137 the displacement operator translates motional states in position / momentum phase space without distortion ( figure [ cap : displacement ] ) . for example , a displacement on an initial ground state of motion results in a coherent state @xmath138 , where the final state is defined in terms of number states as @xmath139 in terms of x - p coordinates , @xmath140 .    the remaining higher order terms in the time - evolution operator originate from the non - commutative property of the interaction hamiltonian at a given time with itself at different times .",
    "this can be understood by considering the displacement operators , which do not commute with one another but rather follow the commutation rule @xmath141 .",
    "therefore the complete time - evolution operator can be constructed by integrating over infinitesimal displacements in time:@xmath142 with the geometric phase accumulated over the entire path from time @xmath143 to @xmath133 expressed as @xmath144 for a near - resonant driving force with detuning @xmath145 ( equation [ eq : interaction picture 2 ] ) , the initial motional state moves in a circular trajectory of radius @xmath146 with periodicity @xmath147 in the rotating frame of harmonic motion , following the path ( from equation [ eq : alpha general])@xmath148 in one period of evolution under this force , the motional state returns to its original phase space coordinates , but acquires a geometric phase of @xmath149 equivalent to the area enclosed by the trajectory ( figure [ cap : displacement ] ) .    for a single qubit experiencing a spin - dependent force ,",
    "the interaction hamiltonian includes a dependence on the internal spin state of the ion . assuming the force couples to only one of the vibrational modes and the other mode can be neglected under the rotating wave approximation , the most general expression for the interaction hamiltonian is@xmath150 where @xmath151 denotes the internal qubit state of the ion , and @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the eigenstates of @xmath154 associated with eigenvalues @xmath155 and @xmath156 respectively .",
    "the interaction provides no coupling between the two orthogonal spin eigenstates of @xmath154 , but the motional state becomes entangled with the spin state as the differential force pushes the motional states of the two spin components in separate directions . at time @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is an integer , the two motional states overlap again , disentangling the vibrational component of the wavefunction from the spin , but leaving the spin component with a phase shift due to the difference in the geometric phases of the paths .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian can also be written in terms of the @xmath154 operator as follows:@xmath159 where @xmath160 is the identity operator , @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "now consider a spin - dependent force applied simultaneously to two ions in the same trapping potential .",
    "the total force on the system is now dependent on the spins of both ions .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian now becomes@xmath163 where @xmath164 , @xmath165 denotes the internal qubit state of ion 1 and ion 2 respectively , and @xmath166 is the total force applied to the state @xmath167 .",
    "the geometric phase of an enclosed loop is proportional to @xmath168 ( equation [ eq : phi one period ] ) , which can be calibrated so that the nonlinearity results in a wavefunction whose spins are not factorizable , thus creating entanglement between two ions",
    ".    the following sections will provide specific examples of entangling gates using spin - dependent forces .",
    "while the fundamental concept is the same in both instances , the experimental requirements and the susceptibility to various sources of phase decoherence are distinct .",
    "we will discuss these cases in detail and provide some solutions for phase control of these gates .",
    "as the name implies , the @xmath119-gate applies a differential force on the eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the interaction has no coupling between the two eigenstates of @xmath119 , conveniently avoiding the neccessity to produce large frequency shifts in the raman beams to bridge the hyperfine splitting .",
    "instead , the raman beams couple to the vibrational states without driving a spin flip .",
    "the two raman beams form a beating wave with periodicity @xmath169 along the weakest trap dimension . due to the ac stark effect , this wave form a moving periodic potential , exerting a near - resonant force on the ion in the direction of travel .",
    "if the ac stark effect has different amplitude on the two qubit states , then the two states experience different forces from the beating wave @xcite .",
    "the @xmath119 gate uses two non - copropagating beams with frequency difference @xmath170 , where @xmath76 is the frequency of vibration and @xmath145 is the detuning from the vibration frequency . for this example",
    ", we will let the beams couple to the stretch mode @xmath171 , though the same algebra can be carried out for the center - of - mass mode .",
    "( stretch mode is a better candidate since it exhibits lower levels of decoherence from background electric fields @xcite . )",
    "we apply two fields @xmath172 where the frequency difference @xmath173 is slightly detuned from the stretch mode frequency .",
    "the field couples each of the spin states to the excited @xmath174 state , and is detuned by a large frequency @xmath48 ( see figure [ cap : sigma_z ] ) . using the same rwa and adiabatic elimination of the excited state used to obtain equation [ adelim_h ] , the interaction hamiltonian for a single ion becomes@xmath175\\left|\\uparrow\\right\\rangle",

    "the first two terms in the expressions in equation [ eq : stark shift ] contribute to the average stark shift for each of the states , which can be canceled by carefully choosing the polarizations @xmath182 and @xmath183 @xcite .",
    "the cross terms represent the variation in intensity formed by the interference pattern that pushes the ion , and must have a different magnitude and/or phase between the two qubit states to create a differential force . in the lamb - dicke limit , and assume the detuning @xmath48 is approximately the same for both spin states ( @xmath184 ) , the interaction hamiltonian for two ions can be written as @xmath185 where @xmath186 , and @xmath187 .",
    "the phase difference between the force applied to the two ions is determined by the optical phase difference @xmath188 , which corresponds to the ion spacing at equilibrium .",
    "if the ions are spaced by an integer multiple of the optical wavelength , i.e. @xmath189 , then they experience the same phase in the force , i.e. @xmath190 ( see figure [ cap : two ions ] ) .",
    "this is a convenient case since the forces cancel when the two spins are aligned in the same direction , and displacement occurs only when the spins are anti - aligned .",
    "a physical explanation of this scenario is that the stretch mode can be excited only when the two ions are pushed in different directions or with different magnitudes .",
    "the fastest gate time possible for this scheme is when the anti - aligned states acquire a @xmath103 phase shift in time @xmath147 , or in other words , a round - trip geometric phase @xmath191 . under these conditions , and",
    "assuming all the average stark shifts have been accounted for , the gate performs the operation @xcite:@xmath192 with a phase shift of @xmath106 on both qubits , the final state is equivalent to the result from a standard phase gate in equation [ eq : phase gate ] .",
    "note that the end result is completely independent of the optical phase of the drive field .",
    "the optical phase @xmath193 is absorbed in the term @xmath194 , translating to a phase shift in @xmath136 that defines the coherent state .",
    "since the acquired geometric phase depends only on the area enclosed by the trajectory , the phase of the resulting state has no correlation to the phase of @xmath194 .",
    "while the optical phase still needs to be coherent during a gate , variations in phase between gates are acceptable since they have no impact on the outcome .",
    "ideally , if the @xmath119 gate can be performed on magnetic field insensitive states , the gate would be extremely phase stable .",
    "unfortunately , in the limit where the detuning from the excited state is large compared to the hyperfine splitting , magnetic field insensitive states have no differential stark shift ( see appendix a ) .",
    "therefore , this gate is susceptible to decoherence from magnetic field fluctuations if performed on magnetic field sensitive states , or if performed on magnetic field insensitive states in the limit where detuning from excited state is comparable to the hyperfine splitting , by spontaneous emission from the excited state .",
    "we call the gate scheme proposed by m@xmath195lmer and s@xmath195rensen @xcite a @xmath120 gate because the interaction is analogous to the @xmath119 gate operating in a rotated basis .",
    "although the original treatment describes the interaction in a four - level ladder system , here we describe it in terms of spins and displaced motional states as in section 2.1 .",
    "the m@xmath195lmer - s@xmath195rensen gate employs simultaneous addressing of both ions with bichromatic fields , one detuned from the red sideband of a vibrational mode by frequency @xmath145 and the other from the blue sideband by @xmath196 .",
    "the two sidebands have equal strength @xmath197 in the lamb - dicke limit , and once again we assume the force couples only to the stretch mode .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is simply the sum of the red sideband plus the blue sideband ( from equations [ rsb ] and [ bsb ] ) with a detuning @xmath145 : @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the sideband rabi frequency , @xmath200 and @xmath201 are the wave - vector difference for the red and blue sidebands , @xmath202 indicates the equilibrium position of the @xmath10-th ion along the x - axis , and @xmath203 and @xmath204 are the phases of the red and blue sidebands respectively .",
    "we can simplify this expression to : @xmath205 where @xmath206=\\hat{\\sigma}_{+}^{(i)}e^{-i\\phi_{s , i}}+\\hat{\\sigma}_{-}^{(i)}e^{i\\phi_{s , i}}.\\label{eq : definition of sigma_phi}\\ ] ] here @xmath207 is the differential force on the @xmath10-th ion , @xmath208 is the spin phase of the @xmath10-th ion , @xmath209 is the phase of the force on the @xmath10-th ion , and @xmath210 where @xmath211 corresponds to the force on the spin state @xmath212 respectively on the @xmath10-th ion . as in the @xmath119 gate , we set the phase of the force acting on the two ions to be opposite , i.e. @xmath213 , and choose @xmath145 and @xmath214 such that the round - trip geometric phase satisfies the condition @xmath215 .",
    "then the final state of the gate is equivalent to the final state in equation [ eq : geometric phase gate ] , except @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the eigenstates of @xmath216 , are replaced by @xmath217 and @xmath218 , the eigenstates of @xmath219 .",
    "this gate written in the @xmath119 basis produces the following truth table:@xmath220 note that after the gate , only the spin phase remains , while the motion phase has no effect on the final state .",
    "as in the @xmath119 gate , drifts in the motion phase between gates is acceptable .",
    "however , the spin phase must be maintained between gates , or alternatively , an equivalent entangling gate with the dependence on the spin phase removed can be formed using a combination of @xmath120 gate and other quantum operations .",
    "an analysis of noise sources for the spin phase requires careful consideration of the physical experimental setup in the laboratory . to drive the red sideband and the blue sideband transitions simultaneously ,",
    "a minimum of three optical frequencies are required , assuming one frequency can be used for both sideband couplings ( see figure [ cap : sigma phi ] ) .",
    "since each of the two fields driving a sideband must have a non - zero wave - vector difference @xmath56 , the optical beams can be set up such that two fields at different frequencies share the same wave - vector @xmath221 , and each individual field combined with a third field having a different wave - vector @xmath222 drives a sideband transition . in other words , if the field along @xmath222 has frequency @xmath223 , then the field propagating along @xmath221 needs both a frequency component @xmath224 to drive a detuned red sideband , and a frequency component @xmath225 to drive a detuned blue sideband .",
    "the choice of the positive or negative frequency differences between the fields determines the sign of @xmath200 and @xmath201 , and determines the gate s susceptibility to the phase stability between the two wave - vectors .",
    "the first scenario involves frequencies of both fields along @xmath221 being higher ( or lower ) than @xmath223 , then the wave - vector difference @xmath56 for both the red and the blue sideband propagates in the same direction ( figure [ cap : beam configurations]a ) .",
    "for example , let the field along @xmath221 include both @xmath226 and @xmath227 frequency components .",
    "then the wave - vector difference @xmath228 for the red sideband and the blue sideband point in the same direction .",
    "instability in the relative beam paths results in an equal phase shift in the sideband transitions , i.e. @xmath229 .",
    "this results in a net shift in the spin phase by @xmath230 .",
    "this is not a desirable situation since the outcome of the gate is sensitive to changes in the beam path length difference on the scale of an optical wavelength .",
    "however , we note that the spin phase shift is exactly the same as the phase shift on the non - copropagating carrier transition , i.e. when the field propagating along @xmath221 has frequency @xmath231",
    ". therefore it is possible to construct a phase gate using the following ramsey experiment : 1 ) perform a @xmath103 rotation on both ion with phase shift @xmath230 using the non - copropagating transition ; 2 ) perform the @xmath120 gate using the frequencies listed above ; 3 ) perform a @xmath106 rotation on both ions with phase shift @xmath230 using the non - copropagating transition .",
    "this rotation from @xmath232 to @xmath233 before the @xmath120 gate and the subsequent rotation back to @xmath232 after the @xmath234 gate effectively removes the dependence on the spin phase @xmath104 as long as the spin phase is constant during the ramsey experiment .",
    "the final state becomes identical to equation [ eq : geometric phase gate ] and has no residual dependence on @xmath235 .",
    "in addition , this scheme is also insensitive to ion spacing since the phase of the push force is always zero in the basis defined by @xmath236 .",
    "another scenario is to select the frequencies along @xmath221 to straddle the frequency along @xmath222 .",
    "then the wave - vector difference for the red and the blue sideband propagates in opposite directions .",
    "for example , let the field along @xmath221 include both @xmath237 and @xmath227 frequency components ( figure [ cap : beam configurations]b ) .",
    "then the wave - vector difference for the red sideband @xmath238 is in the opposite direction as the blue sideband .",
    "instability in the relative beam paths results in an opposite phase shift in the sidebands , i.e. @xmath239 .",
    "this results in a net zero change in the spin phase @xmath240 , removing any spin phase dependence on @xmath235 from the gate .",
    "hence this configuration is termed `` phase insensitive '' .",
    "however , the motion phase in this setup acquires a dependence on the phase shift @xmath235 .",
    "therefore the phase of the force on each ion should be calibrated to be the same by setting the ion spacing ( using the trap frequency as a tuning parameter ) equal to @xmath241 , where @xmath158 in an integer .",
    "while it is possible to produce similar entanglement operations with other values of ion spacing , the gate speed will be slower for the same intensity from the laser , and the output will appear different than the expression in equation [ eq : sigma phi truth table ] .",
    "similar to the other configuration , it is possible to construct a phase gate with the transformation in equation [ eq : geometric phase gate ] , using an analogous ramsey experiment involving single qubit rotations in phase with the gate : 1 ) perform a @xmath103 rotation on both ion with phase shift @xmath240 using either a calibrated and phase locked microwave source or a copropagating raman transition ; 2 ) perform the @xmath242 gate using the frequencies listed here ; 3 ) perform a @xmath106 rotation on both ions with phase shift @xmath240 .",
    "the @xmath243-gate can also be achieved by applying spin - dependent momentum kicks on the ions with fast laser pulses @xcite . for gates in the resolved - sideband limit discussed in section 2",
    ", the ion is assumed to be confined within the lamb - dicke limit , where the spread in the position of the ions from their equilibrium positions is much smaller than the optical wave length .",
    "outside of this limit , the effective rabi frequency fluctuations leads to significant gate errors . for gates using fast laser pulses",
    "@xcite , the impulsive spin - dependent force from the traveling wave has an almost uniform intensity distribution around the ion s position , and this fluctuation of the effective rabi frequency can be safely neglected .",
    "these pulsed gates can therefore faithfully operate outside of the lamb - dicke limit . in this section , we want to show that non - trivial phase errors can arise when the ions are outside the lamb - dicke limit , and suggest a method to cancel these errors by carefully selecting the direction and timing of momentum transfer , a technique reminiscent of the phase cancellation effect in the phase insensitive @xmath242 gate configuration discussed in section 2.3.2 .",
    "the central component of the fast @xmath243 gate in the context of ground state hyperfine qubits is a set of fast resonant laser pulse pairs that exclusively couple one of the two qubit states ( here taken to be @xmath244 ) of each ion to the excited state @xmath179 .",
    "the coupling hamiltonian follows from from equation 2 with @xmath245:@xmath246 where @xmath247 is the resonant rabi frequency of the transition for each ion and as before , the plus ( minus ) sign refers to ion @xmath63 ( @xmath248 ) .",
    "the pulse pairs are set to drive successive @xmath105-pulses ( @xmath249 ) from @xmath250 on the electronic transitions of each ion , with the pulse duration @xmath251 taken to be much shorter than the radiative lifetime of @xmath179 as well as the trap period @xmath252 .",
    "when these two successive fast pulses have non - copropagating wave - vectors @xmath222 and @xmath221 , and both @xmath105-pulses are completed in a time much shorter than the lifetime of state @xmath30 , the result is the following evolution for two ions @xcite:@xmath253 in this expression , @xmath254 and @xmath255 are initial coherent states of the two modes of motion , and @xmath256 are the lamb - dicke parameters of the two modes associated with the wave - vector difference @xmath257 , exactly as defined in section 1.1 .    in the fast @xmath243 gate ,",
    "a series of pulse pairs is applied to the ions so that the motional states of both modes of motion simultaneously return to the same position in phase space regardless of the state of the two qubits . when these fast pulses are interspersed with periods of free evolution of the two modes of harmonic motion ,",
    "the result can be a @xmath243 phase gate for appropriate choices of pulse timing @xcite .",
    "this fast gate works independent of the motional state and outside of the lamb - dicke limit , as long as the motion remains harmonic .",
    "however , outside of the lamb - dicke regime , we find that this gate can be sensitive to changes in the phase of the optical fields due to the change in the position of the ions at different times . in order to see this effect",
    ", we note that this fast @xmath243-gate involves a spin - dependent force on the ion from absorption of a photon from a laser pulse traveling in the @xmath222 direction and emission of another photon to a pulse propagating in a different @xmath221 direction .",
    "we can lock the relative phase of these two propagating laser beams so that their phase difference is set to zero at the ion s equilibrium position . then ,",
    "if during the above impulsive kicks , the ion is at a position @xmath258 from its equilibrium site , it will acquire a net spin - dependent phase factor of @xmath259 from the absorption and the emission of the photon .",
    "this phase factor from each spin - dependent kick is non - negligible if the ion is outside of the lamb - dicke limit . for a complete gate operation with a series of laser kicks , with the spin - dependent phase factor for the @xmath260-th kick",
    "is denoted by @xmath261 , the total phase factor after @xmath14 kicks is given by @xmath262 with @xmath263 .",
    "if the gate speed is comparable or slower than the local ion oscillation frequency , the ion s position @xmath264 at different laser kicks changes depending on the initial momentum and position are become almost uncorrelated .",
    "therefore , the above effect contributes a random phase to the spin , which is a source of the gate infidelity .    to eliminate this random phase effect",
    "when the ion is outside the lamb - dicke limit , one needs to require the gate speed to be significantly faster than the local ion oscillation frequency . in that case , the ion s position at different laser kicks are almost the same although they are still unknown . for any two positions @xmath264 and @xmath265 during the @xmath260-th and @xmath266-th kick respectively , the difference between them can be bounded as @xmath267 , where @xmath268 is the ion s typical speed and @xmath269 denotes the gate time .",
    "due to this position correlation and the fact that the total momentum kicks @xmath270 for the fast gate , we conclude that the random phase @xmath271 is bounded by @xmath272 , and the gate infidelity @xmath273 from this random phase scales as @xmath274 .",
    "the scaling of @xmath275 can be further improved to @xmath276 if we use a more involved sequence of the kicking forces with @xmath158 basic cycles .",
    "the gate time must be short enough to make the scaling parameter @xmath277 . under that condition",
    ", the gate infidelity can then be reduced rapidly to zero with an appropriate pulse sequence even if the ion is outside of the lamb - dicke limit @xcite .",
    "most quantum logic gate schemes for trapped ions operate through interactions with optical electromagnetic fields .",
    "some schemes , such as the @xmath242 gate and the fast @xmath243 gate , have a phase dependence on the phase of the optical driving field , which can become a major source of decoherence if uncontrolled .",
    "we have shown here methods to remove this phase dependence for these two entangling gates by choosing appropriate wave - vector orientations and pulse timings that naturally cancel the phase factor @xmath259 upon the completion of the gate .",
    "furthermore , the sideband resolved @xmath242 gate can operate on magnetic field insensitive qubit states , removing an unavoidable vulnerability of the @xmath243 gate .",
    "these techniques eliminates the random phase from the optical driving field while maintaining phase coherence at the rf or microwave atomic frequencies , allowing long gate sequences to be performed over the timescales beyond the coherence time of the optical fields .",

    "in this appendix we will show that magnetic field insensitive states have no differential stark shift in the limit where the detuning from the excited state is much larger than the hyperfine splitting , i.e. @xmath278 @xcite . to find the field insensitive states for a system in the @xmath279 ground state with some nuclear spin @xmath280",
    ", we write down the hamiltonian for the hyperfine interaction in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath281 : @xmath282 where @xmath283 is the total angular momentum of the electron , @xmath284 is the nuclear spin , and @xmath285 is the contact term . @xmath286 and @xmath287 are the lande g - factors for the nucleus and the electron .",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are linear combinations of the @xmath288 states , and can be represented as @xmath289 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath290 and @xmath291 are functions of the magnetic field .",
    "if two states @xmath292 and @xmath293 are magnetic field insensitive , then @xmath294 applying ehrenfest s theorem , @xmath295+\\left|b_{i}\\right|^{2}\\left[\\frac{g_{j}}{2}+g_{i}(m_{f , i}+\\frac{1}{2})\\right].\\label{eq : de / db}\\ ] ] normalization of the eigenstates and solving equation [ eq : partial b ] gives the result @xmath296 .",
    "since the dipole moment of the electron dominates the dipole moment of the nucleus , i.e. @xmath297 , we can approximate it as @xmath298 @xmath299    now consider the stark shift for each of these magnetic field insensitive states .",
    "the ac stark shift is given by@xmath300 where @xmath301 is the excited state with the corresponding z - component of the electron and nuclear spins .",
    "since the electric dipole only couples the orbital angular momentum of the electron , @xmath302 only couples to the states with the same @xmath303 .",
    "so the expression can be simplified to@xmath304 if the energy difference between the two states @xmath305 and @xmath306 is small compared to @xmath48 , and applying the results from equation [ eq : coef_relation ] , then we find that @xmath307 .",
    "so we conclude that the energy shift due to stark effect is the same for any two magnetic field insensitive states .",
    "the fields driving stimulated raman transition in ions are typically generated from a single laser source with the multiple frequencies generated by optical modulators .",
    "acousto - optic modulators can produce frequency shifts up to about 1 ghz , while electro - optic modulators can modulate at upwards of 10 ghz or more .",
    "the electro - optic modulator offers a solution for driving raman transitions in ion species with a large hyperfine splitting , but unlike acousto - optic modulators , all frequencies in the modulated field have the same wave - vector , making it difficult to separate different frequency components .",
    "electro - optic modulators control the birefringence of uniaxial crystals with a lower frequency electric field , effectively modulating either the phase or the polarization of the incident optical field , depending on the orientation of the optical axes .",
    "since the raman coupling is polarization - dependent , the polarization modulation is equivalent to an amplitude modulation . for non - copropagating raman beam geometry",
    ", the modulated field is divided using a beam splitter and the two beams recombine at the trap from different angles . if the difference between any frequency from one beam and any frequency from the other beam matches the energy splitting of two atomic and/or phonon levels , then a transition can potentially be driven .",
    "however , the amplitude of each pair of frequencies driving the transition can result in cancellations in the total transition rate .",
    "usually , amplitude modulation produces sidebands with the same phase , resulting in the transition rates adding constructively . but phase modulation produces a comb of sidebands , some having amplitudes with opposite phases , which could result in a total transition rate of zero .",
    "this problem can be remedied by setting the beam path length difference between the two beams to certain values that produces a non - zero total transition rate @xcite .",
    "this effectively adds a different phase to each sideband , resulting in a transition rate proportional to the squared electric field @xmath308 where @xmath309 is the @xmath158-th order bessel function .",

    "@xmath311 is the wave - number associated with the modulation frequency and @xmath312 is the beam path length difference .    to avoid nulling the average intensity due to destructive interference between the two fields at the ion ,",
    "the field propagating along one path can be frequency shifted slightly from the field in the other path .",
    "the modulation frequency would then have to be adjusted to compensate for this frequency shift so that pairs of frequencies matches the energy difference between the two coupled levels .",
    "when the frequency offset is accounted for , all the @xmath56 vectors driving the transition have the same sign , and the resulting transition is exactly the same as if each of the two beams having only a single frequency . to reverse the @xmath56 vector , only the frequency offset on one beam",
    "needs to be changed .",
    "for example , to drive a raman transition between two levels which have an energy splitting of @xmath313 , the modulation frequency of the eom can be set to @xmath314 .",
    "the modulated beam is split into two paths , with the beam in path a frequency shifted by @xmath315 and the beam in path b frequency shifted by @xmath316 .",
    "the two beams are recombined at the ion , with wave - vector @xmath222 and @xmath221 respective to beam path a and b. in this case the wave - vector difference @xmath56 for the raman transition is equal to @xmath221@xmath317 , since the beam in path b has higher frequency .",
    "the beam in path b can also be frequency shifted by @xmath318 instead , in which case the wave - vector difference @xmath56 would be @xmath319 since the beam in path a would have the higher frequency .",

    "these two frequencies can be arbitrarily close to one another by tuning the modulation frequency of the eo close to the qubit frequency splitting @xmath323 , which allows both frequencies to be generated using a single frequency shifter with a given bandwidth . however",
    ", if the modulation frequency of the eo is exactly @xmath12 , then each beam would simultaneously drive a copropagating carrier transition ( see section 1.2.1 ) that will interfere with the @xmath242 operation . therefore the modulation frequency should be tuned to approximately but not exactly @xmath323 ."
