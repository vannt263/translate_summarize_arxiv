    "to understand the deep structure of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite , in particular the holographic principle and quantum black holes , it is necessary to analyze in detail the entropy counting .",
    "most of the work on black hole entropy in lqg focuses on boundary state counting , especially in the isolated horizon framework @xcite . in the present work we propose to extend these considerations to the bulk entropy .",
    "we use the framework outlined in @xcite . we consider a given spin network state for the 3d geometry of the ( canonical )",
    "hypersurface and focus on an arbitrary bounded region . the previous work @xcite analyzed the boundary entropy of such a region assuming a totally mixed state , i.e having no knowledge about its interior .",
    "we naturally recovered the area - entropy law . in the present work ,",
    "we extend this calculation to the bulk entropy .",
    "more precisely , we retain the information about the graph ( underlying the quantum geometry state ) inside the considered region and , under given boundary conditions , count all the distinct spin network states on that graph",
    ". then the entropy  defined as the logarithm of the number of states depends on the topology of the graph through its number of loops .    in the trivial topology case with no loop",
    ", we recover the previous result obtained by counting boundary states @xcite .",
    "as soon as the topology becomes non - trivial the entropy diverges .",
    "nevertheless , we identify a symmetry responsible for this divergence and get a finite entropy after suitable gauge fixing .",
    "the entropy increases with the number of loops . for a complicated enough graph topology",
    "we find that the entropy can grow arbitrarily large compared to the boundary area .",
    "however , we also identify a regime for which the entropy still scales as the area .",
    "we call it the  holographic regime \" .",
    "there it turns out to be possible to arbitrarily adjust the proportionality factor between the entropy and the area ( without changing the immirzi parameter ) .",
    "if quantum gravity is to be a holographic theory , then the lqg dynamics should be such that projecting on physical states selects this regime .",
    "finally , the gauge fixing that we use seems to be related to a gauge fixing of the hamiltonian constraint , but more investigations are required to understand that relationship .",
    "let us start with an arbitrary spin network state on the canonical hypersurface @xmath0 . consider a connected bounded region @xmath1 of its graph that includes a finite set of vertices and the edges that connect them .",
    "the boundary @xmath2 is the set of edges which have only one end vertex laying in @xmath3 .",
    "we can picture @xmath3 as a 3-ball and @xmath2 as its boundary 2-sphere punctured by the boundary edges .",
    ", width=188 ]    let us call @xmath4 the graph inside @xmath3 and assume that the boundary @xmath2 is made of @xmath5 edges .",
    "the spin network state carries spin labels ( @xmath6 representations ) attached to each edge of the graph .",
    "in particular , the boundary data consists of the spin labels @xmath7 of the @xmath5 boundary edges puncturing @xmath2 .",
    "we assume these labels fixed once and for all as defining the boundary .",
    "we further take them all equal to the lowest spin @xmath8 . as it was shown in @xcite ,",
    "this hypothesis simplifies the calculations and it is straightforward to generalize the calculations to any generic configuration .",
    "for such a choice of spins the number of boundary edges @xmath5 is necessarily even , and we therefore assume in the following that the boundary is made of @xmath9 edges .",
    "in @xcite we motivated defining boundary states as intertwiners between the @xmath9 boundary representations  or equivalently as singlet states in the tensor product of the @xmath9 spin @xmath10 .",
    "counting the dimension @xmath11 of the intertwiner space  gives the ( boundary ) entropy @xmath12 in term of the binomial coefficient @xmath13 : s _ n_= 2n2 -32n +  assuming that every @xmath14 puncture contributes a microscopic area @xmath15 in planck units , we find that the entropy satisfies the usual proportionality law at the leading order , and has a @xmath16 logarithmic correction : s_~ -32a+  , where the total boundary area is @xmath17 . in the standard lqg framework , the microscopic area is given in terms of the immirzi parameter @xmath18 . then the semi - classical relation @xmath19 can be used to fix the value of the immirzi ambiguity @xmath20 .",
    "the isolated horizon framework presents a different though similar calculation for the entropy .",
    "it leads to a different ratio @xmath21 and thus a different value of @xmath20 , but also to a different value of the logarithmic correction - usually @xmath22 instead of the present @xmath23 .",
    "this boundary entropy calculation can be interpreted as computing the number of spin network states assuming that the graph @xmath4 inside the region @xmath3 is reduced to a single vertex .",
    "assuming that the outside observer have no access to any information about the graph inside @xmath3 , we have indeed coarse - grained this graph to a single point : this can be dubbed the  black point \" model .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the effects of keeping a non - trivial graph @xmath4 on the entropy calculation . as a spin - network wave functional is a function of the ( gravitational ) holonomies , it is possible to have an impression that degrees of freedom are attached to the edges of @xmath4 .",
    "however , due to the gauge invariance , degrees of freedom are truly carried by the loops of the graph .",
    "consider @xmath4 with @xmath24 vertices , @xmath25 internal edges and @xmath26 external legs .",
    "then the number of independent loops is @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath4 is a tree , @xmath28 , the entropy is exactly the same as for the trivial graph with a single vertex .",
    "as soon as the graph possesses a non - trivial topology , @xmath29 , we obtain an infinite number of states and thus of degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , loops of a spin network can carry arbitrary spins @xmath30 independently of each other . to overcome this obstacle",
    ", we note that this divergence is associated to a further gauge invariance .",
    "this gauge invariance is generated by the action of the holonomy operators on the loops of the spin network state . to count physical degrees of freedom and to get a meaningful finite entropy , we gauge fix this action @xcite .",
    "we use the simplest gauge fixing and fix the spin associated to each loop of @xmath4 .",
    "it actually requires fixing the spin of only one link of each loop .",
    "having done this , we will see in the following section that we indeed obtain a finite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the resulting entropy does not depend of the choice of the spins used in the gauge fixing and only depends on the size / area of the boundary @xmath26 and on the complexity of the graph @xmath4 described by the number of loops @xmath31 .",
    "this gauge fixing of the holonomy operators on the graph loops can be related to the gauge fixing of the hamiltonian constraint . in the context of the topological bf theory ,",
    "this would actually exactly coincide with the action of the hamiltonian constraint . in the case of lqg , it is more subtle and we should investigate further the validity and physical interpretation of our gauge fixing . while we postpone this for future work , we insist that in our framework this gauge fixing is natural .",
    "first , we gauge fix the holonomies on loops inside the considered region @xmath3 .",
    "this a priori does not affect the dynamics of the exterior of @xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , if we did not gauge fix them we would be over - counting the number of states ( seen by an external observer ) .",
    "what would be non - trivial is to gauge fix the action of holonomies on loops crossing the boundary / horizon @xmath2 .",
    "second , we do check that the number of degrees of freedom does not depend on the gauge fixing and that the action of the holonomies creates isomorphic copies of the same  physical \" hilbert space . in short",
    ", we are disregarding the internal excitations that do not couple to the exterior of the region and that would produce an overcounting in the entropy ascribed to @xmath3 by an external observer .    in the following sections we study in detail the one - loop case and",
    "then show that the calculations can be straightforwardly generalized to an arbitrary graph topology .",
    "finally we discuss the different regimes of entropy corresponding to the different scaling of the number of loops @xmath31 with the size of the boundary @xmath5 .",
    "let us start by reviewing the black - point case , @xmath28 .",
    "the hilbert space of spin networks of a tree is isomorphic to the space of intertwiners between the boundary representations @xcite .",
    "its dimension is given by : _ 0 = _ ( 2 ) dg _ 12(g)^2n= , where @xmath32 is the normalized haar measure on the @xmath6 lie group and @xmath33 is the character in the fundamental spin-@xmath34 representation .",
    "this formula can be interpreted in terms of a random walk with a mirror in origin .",
    "the binomial coefficients @xmath13 give the number of returns to the origin for the usual random walk , while the mirror introduces the factor @xmath35 .",
    "consider now the one - loop diagram on the left of fig .",
    "[ oneloop ] .",
    "it is a loop to which @xmath9 legs are attached , so all the vertices are 3-valent gauge invariance at every vertex ( see e.g. @xcite . ] .",
    "pick an arbitrary link @xmath36 and fix the spin which it carries , @xmath37 .",
    "this obviously fixes the action of the holonomy operator on the loop : acting with a holonomy carrying a spin @xmath38 on this state would change the spin-@xmath39 representation into the tensor product representation @xmath40 .",
    ", width=264 ]    assume that @xmath41 . moving from the initial link @xmath36 to the next link @xmath42 , we see that @xmath42 can carry either the spin @xmath43 or @xmath44 since the external leg between @xmath36 and @xmath42 injects a spin @xmath34 into the diagram .",
    "going on one finally arrives back to the initial link @xmath36 and the initial representation @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the number of possible spin labeling @xmath45 is exactly the number of returns to the origin of a random walk after @xmath9 iterations : _ 1=2nn .",
    "we get a finite result which is different from the tree case .",
    "moreover , it does not depend on the chosen spin @xmath39 .",
    "this hilbert space leads to the following asymptotic behavior of the entropy : s_1 2n2 - 12n+  it does not affect the leading order proportional to the area but only the logarithmic correction .    there is nevertheless a subtlety : the assumption that the spin @xmath39 is large enough compared to the boundary size @xmath5 . indeed",
    "if @xmath39 is smaller than @xmath46 , there exists the possibility that the random walk along the loop will ascribe a spin 0 to a link .",
    "in such a case , we can not move down to a @xmath47 spin but can only go back up to @xmath48 .",
    "then we get a smaller hilbert space .",
    "we discard this case because we do not consider it as a true one - loop graph anymore .",
    "indeed , if a link is labeled with a spin @xmath49 , it is just as if that link did not exist since the corresponding spin network wave function would not depend on the holonomy on that link .",
    "then if we remove that link from the graph , we end up with a tree again .",
    "therefore , we interpret this situation when @xmath50 as describing a superposition of a 0-loop and 1-loop graphs .",
    "however , we can still compute exactly the dimension of the hilbert space . for this purpose , it is more convenient to use the another one - loop diagram that is shown on the right of fig .",
    "[ oneloop ] .",
    "we now look at the one - loop diagram with two vertices : all the boundary links merge into a single link to which the loop is then attached .",
    "assume that the loop still carries a fixed spin @xmath39 and we call @xmath51 the spin carried by the intermediate link .",
    "on one side , we have an intertwiner between the @xmath9 spin @xmath34 and the spin @xmath51 .",
    "as long as @xmath52 , the dimension of this intertwiner space is @xcite : d^(n)_k=2nn+k-2nn+k+1=. on the other side , we have a unique 3-valent intertwiner between two representations @xmath39 and the same representation @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding intertwiner space is of dimension one as long as @xmath53 .",
    "the total number of spin network states amounts to summing over all possible @xmath51 s from @xmath49 to the maximal allowed spin @xmath54 : n_1^(j)= _ k=0^k_maxd^(n)_k = 2nn-2nn+ k_max+1 .",
    "when @xmath39 is larger than @xmath46 , we recover the previous result with @xmath55 . at the other end of the spectrum ,",
    "when @xmath39 vanishes , we recover the 0-loop case with @xmath56 .",
    "finally , we see that the values of the spin @xmath39 carried by the loop between @xmath49 and @xmath46 interpolate between the tree case and the 1-loop case .",
    "this allows us to interpret this intermediate situation as a superposition of the 0-loop and 1-loop cases , and moreover to identify the true 1-loop case as the @xmath41 regime when the entropy does not depend anymore on the specific value of @xmath39 .    to conclude this section",
    ", we showed that considering a one - loop graph over a tree increases the entropy .",
    "after carefully gauge fixing , we obtain a finite entropy which differs from the 0-loop case only by the logarithm correction , @xmath47 instead of @xmath16 .    in the following sections",
    ", we generalize this analysis to an arbitrary number of loops",
    ". we will show that if the number of loops is fixed it will only affect the logarithm correction while if we allow the number of loops to scale with @xmath5 it may well also affect the leading order .",

    "our aim was to compute the number of ( spin network ) states describing the quantum geometry of a bounded region of space , living on a fixed graph and with fixed boundary conditions .",
    "this bulk entropy is obviously related to the complexity of the graph and was found to be related to the number of loops @xmath31 of that graph .",
    "the straightforward calculation then gives at first an infinite entropy .",
    "nevertheless , after fixing a certain number of labels of the spin network states , we were able to extract meaningful finite results .",
    "this lead to the identification of different sectors of the spin network hilbert space depending on @xmath31 with different asymptotical behavior of the entropy .",
    "we can a priori have an entropy growing as large as we want if we choose a number of loops @xmath31 large enough .",
    "nevertheless , two sectors are particularly interesting .",
    "if the graph complexity is fixed while the boundary area grows , then the bulk entropy @xmath80 has the same leading order than the boundary entropy but the logarithmic correction to the entropy changes and increases with @xmath31 . on the other hand , if @xmath31 grows linearly with the boundary area @xmath84 , then the bulk entropy also grows linearly with the area but the ratio @xmath21 depends explicitly on the ratio @xmath132 .",
    "we call this sector the  holographic regime \"",
    ".    if we want black holes to satisfy the area - entropy law , the quantum black hole state must necessarily be in the holographic regime .",
    "however , this regime is generic enough to allow for a fine - tuning of the ratio @xmath21 to @xmath133 without changing the immirzi parameter ( i.e the value of the minimal quantum of area ) .",
    "indeed , we can always change the area - complexity ratio @xmath132 to adjust the value of @xmath21 .",
    "our point of view is that it is the lqg dynamic that is supposed to select the physical regime and value of @xmath132 .",
    "there are two important issues to address in this scenario .",
    "first , should the considered entropy for the space region be its boundary entropy or its bulk entropy ?",
    "we see a priori no reason why the degrees of freedom inside the region would not couple to the space outside",
    ". then the bulk degrees of freedom would affect the black hole evaporation .",
    "however , the case of a black hole might ( should ? ) be drastically different from a generic region of space . this is a question that needs to be addressed by the lqg dynamics . the second issue is directly related to our approach .",
    "our entropy calculation relies on a partial fixing of the spin network labels .",
    "we discussed that it could be interpreted as a gauge fixing of the hamiltonian constraint , but this needs to be worked out in details .",
    "thus , the limits of validity of the present work depend on understanding the legitimacy of this gauge fixing .",
    "however , even if it does not turn out to be interpreted as the gauge fixing of a certain symmetry , we have nevertheless identified the different sectors of the spin network kinematical space with different bulk entropy behavior , but we still need to provide these different sectors with a proper physical interpretation .",
    "the asymptotic expressions for @xmath134 and the different regimes of @xmath135 are based on the use of stirling formula , replacement of the sum by the ( euler - maclaurent ) integral and the saddle point ( gaussian ) approximation .",
    "it is convenient for the analysis to introduce a shifted loop number @xmath136 and consider the ratio @xmath137 .    the first factor in the sum of eq .",
    "( [ nicesum ] ) takes the form ~f(k",
    "/ n)e^-n(k / n ) , where f(x)= , ( x)= ( 1+x)(1+x)+(1-x)(1-x ) .",
    "the second factor becomes ~=g(k / n , l / n)e^-n(k / n , l / n ) , where g(x,)= , ( x,)=xx -(x+)(x+ ) .",
    "the sum of eq .",
    "( [ nicesum ] ) is replaced by the integral n_l~ _ 0 ^ 1 dx f(x)g(x,)e^-n(x , ) , with @xmath138 .",
    "the saddle point approximation requires the knowledge of the derivatives of the exponent : _ x=,_x^2=. the unique fixed point , @xmath139 , in the interval @xmath140 $ ] is x_0(- ) , and it is easy to check that @xmath141 is always positive on @xmath140 $ ] .    in particular , for @xmath142",
    "the minimum of @xmath143 is inside the interval and we use the gaussian approximation @xmath144 that gives the following asymptotics for the entropy : s(l , n)=n_l , n_l~f(x_0)g(x_0 , ) .",
