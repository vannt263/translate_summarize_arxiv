    "<S> put energy @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> what is the nature of the state in the limit @xmath3 ? </S>",
    "<S> in particular , what is the entropy @xmath4 ?    this question has never been seriously addressed in string theory which aims to be a complete theory including gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the reason can be traced to a general feeling : wo nt the maximal entropy state be a _ black hole _ , whose states we can not really understand ?    but this is where the question gets interesting . </S>",
    "<S> suppose we take v=(1  meter)^3 ,  e=1  m_a solar mass black hole has radius @xmath5 , so it can not fit into our meter sized box . </S>",
    "<S> there are four possibilities :    \\(a ) the entropy in the box will be that of a solar mass hole    \\(b ) the entropy will be that of a hole of size 1 meter , the largest that can fit in our box    \\(c ) the entropy will be something else , perhaps in between ( a ) and ( b )    \\(d ) we can not put one solar mass of energy in the box of size 1 meter    to see why this question is relevant to cosmology , forget for a moment the notions of inflation and dark energy , and imagine following a traditional big bang cosmology to early times @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> let the @xmath7 slice be a torus ; thus we have a flat universe with torus volume @xmath1 shrinking towards zero as @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> . what will the torus contain ?    at large @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> the torus contains dust . at smaller @xmath8 , we expect radiation , which has an entropy @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> what happens at even smaller @xmath8 depends on the theory ; for example in string theory we will enter a ` string gas ' phase where @xmath10 . proceeding further back , </S>",
    "<S> we ask : what is the nature of the maximal entropic state in the limit of infinite energy density ?        </S>",
    "<S> two clarifications before we proceed :    \\(i ) one may wonder if we should look for _ low _ entropy states so that the entropy can increase in the future . </S>",
    "<S> but in fact we have traditionally considered the _ maximal _ entropy state at any given @xmath8 : in the traditional big bang we took the radiation phase at early times because radiation has more entropy than dust , and we take a string gas phase at even earlier times because the string gas has more entropy than radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that we can have the maximal entropy state at a _ given _ volume @xmath1 ; when @xmath1 increases the entropy can increase further , with a change in the nature of the state from string gas to radiation to dust .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) should we consider the maximal entropy state if it turns out to involve black holes @xcite ? </S>",
    "<S> if the universe started off with black holes then would it not always have these holes , in contradiction to what we see around us today ? </S>",
    "<S> but in recent years we have understood that black hole states are no different from other states in string theory . </S>",
    "<S> if we switch off gravity , then the entropy of black holes is reproduced by the states of multiply intersecting branes @xcite . if we turn on gravity , these states ` swell up ' to become ` fuzzballs ' , with the following geometric structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 6 small compact directions of string theory make nontrivial fibrations over the 3 space directions in the volume @xmath1 , creating generalized analogues of kaluza - klein monopoles and antimonopoles . </S>",
    "<S> the set of all such solutions account for the bekenstein entropy of the hole @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will not need the detailed structure of these solutions ; all we note is that black hole states are not fundamentally different from other states in string theory .    in standard general relativity </S>",
    "<S> there is no constraint on how much @xmath2 we can put in a given volume @xmath1 ; more @xmath2 simply gives a larger rate of expansion , via the relation @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we ignore ( d ) . to choose between the other possibilities we must look into the structure of microstates . </S>",
    "<S> a study of simple fuzzballs suggests that we get ( b ) . to see the reason we recall why the typical fuzzball has size of order the schwarzschild radius . </S>",
    "<S> when we explicitly construct the states of the hole , we get @xmath12 orthogonal wavefunctions of the string fields . in order to be orthogonal the different wavefunctions can not really overlap , and the minimum region requires to hold all the wavefunctions turns out to be order the schwarzschild radius .    now if we limit the size of our region to be 1 meter ( while still taking one solar mass of energy ) , then not all the @xmath12 wavefunctions for the solar mass hole can fit in our box . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit study of the wavefunctions of the 2-charge extremal hole indicates that possibility ( b ) holds in that case @xcite , and in what follows we will assume that ( b ) is correct for more general situations as well .    </S>",
    "<S> the above conclusion may seem natural in retrospect : the entropy @xmath13 in a volume is order the entropy of the largest hole which can fit in that volume . </S>",
    "<S> but note that we have gone somewhat beyond the standard bekenstein relation @xmath14 @xcite : there is no boundary in the torus that we can compute the area of , and the energy @xmath2 is _ more _ than that of the hole that would fit in the given volume @xmath1 .    to see how the above observation may be important for cosmology , let us recall how the information paradox @xcite gets resolved in string theory . consider a shell of mass @xmath15 that is collapsing through its horizon radius @xmath16 . in ordinary 3 + 1 dimensional gravity the wavefunction of the shell moves in the expected way to smaller @xmath17 , creating the traditional black hole geometry . </S>",
    "<S> but in string theory the @xmath12 states of the hole give alternate wavefunctions with the same quantum numbers as the shell . </S>",
    "<S> there is a small amplitude for the wavefunction of the shell to tunnel into one of these microstate wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> we may estimate this amplitude as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and we use @xmath20 for all length scales . </S>",
    "<S> this gives s_gravity~1 g d^4 x ~1 g 1(gm)^2(gm)^4~gm^2~ ( mm_p ) ^2 thus @xmath21 is indeed tiny . </S>",
    "<S> but we must now multiply by the _ number _ of states that we can tunnel to , and this is given by @xmath22 where s_bek = a4g~(gm)^2g~ ( mm_p ) ^2        thus the smallness of the tunneling amplitude is offset by the remarkably large degeneracy of states that the black hole has @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunction of the shell tunnels into these ` fuzzball ' states in a time much shorter than the evaporation time of the hole @xcite , and then these fuzzballs states radiate energy much like any other normal body @xcite . in short , the semiclassical approximation that leads to the standard black hole geometry </S>",
    "<S> gets invalidated by the large measure of phase space over which the wavefunction of the shell can spread .    </S>",
    "<S> now consider the universe at a time when the volume @xmath23 is very small , but @xmath2 is very large @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> very few of the @xmath24 states allowed at this energy @xmath2 can fit in our box  we say that the energy @xmath2 is ` hypercompressed ' . </S>",
    "<S> there is a small amplitude @xmath25 per unit time for tunneling between states in @xmath23 and states in a _ </S>",
    "<S> larger _ </S>",
    "<S> volume @xmath26 . because the entropy of black hole type states is huge , there are vastly more states in @xmath26 , and the wavefunction will drift towards the volume @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we access even more states if we expand to a yet larger volume @xmath27 , and so on , giving a ` push ' towards larger volumes . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[ffour ] gives a toy quantum mechanical model for this evolution : each state in a given box can transition into a _ band _ ( with energy spacing @xmath28 ) in the next larger box . </S>",
    "<S> the peak of the wavefunction moves through the volumes @xmath29 with @xcite k_peak(t)t note that this expansion is in _ addition _ to any expansion rate obtained from the classical gravity equations , since it is generated by the phase space measure describing the degeneracy of states . </S>",
    "<S> note that the degeneracy of states is always a factor in quantum systems , but what makes it significant for our macroscopic problem is the enormously large entropy of black hole type states .     can transition with amplitude @xmath25 to a band of states in volume @xmath30 , with band spacing @xmath28 ; thus we get a series of ` fermi golden rule absorptions ' taking us to larger volumes . ]    obtaining precise rates of expansion from this physics will have to await the extraction of the parameters @xmath31 from string theory . </S>",
    "<S> but qualitatively , we can see two regimes where this extra ` push ' can be relevant :    \\(i ) in the early universe , matter can be very ` hyper - compressed ' , so we may get an analogue of inflation .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) the cosmological horizon @xmath32 today holds just about the mass needed to make a black hole with radius @xmath32 . thus matter is on the border of being hyper - compressed , and we may get order unity corrections to the expansion rate .    to summarize , we have traditionally made little use of the enormous degeneracy of gravitational states implied by the bekenstein formula . with the explicit realization of these states in string theory , we find that their large measure @xmath33 $ ] competes with the classical term @xmath34 in path integrals . </S>",
    "<S> this correction resolves the information paradox , and may also provide cosmological effects that avoid the need for fine tuned inflation potentials or anthropic arguments that must tune @xmath35 to @xmath36 . </S>"
