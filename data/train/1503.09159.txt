    "minimal surfaces have recently become subject of intensive study in physical and biological sciences , e.g. materials science and molecular engineering which is due to its area minimizing property .",
    "they are used in modeling physical phenomena as soap films , block copolymers , protein folding , solar cells , nanoporous membranes , etc .",
    "minimal surfaces found applications also in architecture , cagd , and computer graphics where bzierpolynomials and splines are widely used to efficiently describing , representing and visualizing 3d objects .",
    "hence it is important to know minimal surfaces in polynomial form of lower degrees .",
    "bi - cubic polynomial minimal surfaces are studied in @xcite .",
    "polynomial surfaces of degree 5 and 6 are studied in @xcite and @xcite where some interesting surfaces are described and their properties are examined .",
    "examples of polynomial minimal surfaces of arbitrary degree are presented in @xcite .    in section 3",
    "we specify the result of cosn and monterde @xcite concerning bi - cubic polynomial minimal surfaces .",
    "we note that their proof that these surfaces coincide up to affine transformation with the classical enneper surface concerns the case of surfaces in _ isothermal _ parameters . in section 4",
    "we consider an analogous problem for polynomial surfaces defined by charts @xmath0 of degree 4 on both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that they are more various than the bi - cubic ones , so they may be more useful in computer graphics . in this paper",
    "we use a new approach to minimal surfaces proposed by ganchev @xcite as well as the method from @xcite to obtain a parametrization of the surface in canonical parameters .",
    "in section 5 we consider bi - quartic harmonic bzier   surfaces .",
    "we show that for a special choice of nine boundary control points the corresponding harmonic bzier   surface is uniquely determined and is symmetric with respect to one of the coordinate planes @xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath4 , and @xmath5 . based on the bzier representation we apply computer modeling and visualization tools to illustrate and support our results .",
    "let @xmath6 be a regular surface",
    ". then @xmath6 is locally defined by a chart @xmath7 as usual we denote by @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , ... the partial derivatives of the vector function @xmath11 .",
    "then the coefficients of the first fundamental form are given by the inner products @xmath12 and the unit normal is @xmath13 then the coefficients of the second fundamental form are defined by @xmath14 the gauss curvature @xmath15 and the mean curvature @xmath16 of @xmath6 are given by @xmath17 respectively . note that the gauss curvature and the mean curvature of a surface do not depend on the chart .",
    "the surface @xmath6 is said to be _ minimal _ if its mean curvature vanishes identically . in this case",
    "the gauss curvature is negative and the normal curvature of @xmath6 is the function @xmath18 , see @xcite .",
    "we say that the chart @xmath0 is _ isothermal _ or that the parameters @xmath19 are isothermal if @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "it is always possible to change the parameters @xmath19 so that the resulting chart be isothermal .",
    "we note however that this change of the parameters to isothermal ones is in general nonlinear .    when the chart is isothermal it is possible to use complex functions to investigate it .",
    "we shall explain briefly this .",
    "namely let @xmath22 and @xmath23 be two holomorphic functions ( actually sometimes they are taken meromorphic ) .",
    "define the weierstrass complex curve @xmath24 by @xmath25 then @xmath24 is a minimal curve , i.e. @xmath26 , and its real and imaginary parts @xmath27 are minimal charts .",
    "moreover , they are isothermal and are harmonic functions ( i.e. @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the laplace operator ) as the real and complex part of a holomorphic function .",
    "conversely , every minimal surface can be defined at least locally in this way .",
    "of course a minimal surface can be generated by the weierstrass formula with different pairs of complex functions @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "it is easy to see that the coefficients of the first fundamental form of a chart defined via the weierstrass formula with functions @xmath22 , @xmath23 are given by @xmath31 the normal curvature is computed to be @xmath32 see @xcite , theorem 22.33 .",
    "recently ganchev @xcite has proposed a new approach to minimal surfaces . briefly speaking he introduces special parameters called _ canonical principal parameters_.",
    "a chart with such parameters is isothermal .",
    "moreover , the coefficients of the two fundamental forms are given by @xmath33      l=1 , & \\",
    "m=0 , & \\ n=-1 .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] his idea leads to the fact that the real part of the minimal curve @xmath34 is a minimal surface in canonical principal parameters . note that this is the weierstrass formula with @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "we shall use also the following theorems :    * theorem a. * @xcite if a surface is parametrized with canonical principal parameters , then the normal curvature satisfies the equation @xmath37 conversely , for any solution @xmath38 of equation there exists a * unique * ( up to position in the space ) minimal surface with normal curvature @xmath38 , where @xmath19 are canonical principal parameters.@xmath39    * theorem b. * @xcite let the minimal surface @xmath6 be defined by the real part of .",
    "any solution of the differential equation @xmath40 defines a change of the isothermal parameters of @xmath6 to canonical principal parameters .",
    "moreover , the function @xmath41 that defines @xmath6 via the ganchev s formula is given by @xmath42.@xmath39    the canonical principal parameters @xmath19 are determined uniquely up to the changes @xmath43",
    "by investigating minimal bzier surfaces cosn and monterde @xcite formulate that any bi - cubic minimal surface defined by @xmath44 is , up to affine transformation in the space , actually an affine reparametrization of the classical enneper surface @xmath45 ( this chart of the enneper surface is obtained from the weierstrass formula with @xmath46 , @xmath47 . )",
    "we note that their proof actually refers to bi - cubic * isothermal * minimal charts . indeed , as we mentioned in section [ preliminaries ] , the change of parameters to isothermal ones is in general nonlinear .",
    "below we give a simple example of a bi - cubic minimal chart that can not be transformed by an affine transformation into an isothermal one .",
    "consider the bi - cubic chart @xmath48 it can be shown by direct computation that this chart defines a minimal surface .",
    "of course we can simply remark that this is a reparametrization of @xmath49 with @xmath1 replaced by @xmath50 , so the mean curvature vanishes identically .",
    "let us make an affine transformation of the parameters @xmath19 : @xmath51 with nonzero jacobian , i.e. @xmath52 we shall try to determine the coefficients @xmath53 , so that the chart @xmath54 be isothermal .",
    "actually we shall see what follows only from @xmath55 .",
    "a direct computation shows that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 since @xmath58 is positive , the vanishing of @xmath59 implies @xmath60 .",
    "hence the coefficients in @xmath61 must be zero .",
    "in particular the coefficients of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 are @xmath65 these equations imply immediately @xmath66 let e.g. @xmath67 . from it follows @xmath68 , which contradicts .",
    "so it is impossible to make an affine transformation of the parameters in to obtain an isothermal chart",
    ".    * remark .",
    "* in view of the above notes the problem of existing bi - cubic minimal surfaces different from the enneper one is still open .",
    "more generally it will be interesting to obtain a method for finding polynomial minimal non - isothermal charts .",
    "in this section we examine minimal surfaces represented by isothermal polynomial charts of degree 4 in both @xmath69 .",
    "we may expect that there exists more than one such surface , but it is interesting to know `` how many '' are there .",
    "so consider the chart @xmath70 where @xmath71 are vectors in @xmath72 .",
    "using @xmath21 and looking on its coefficient of @xmath73 we obtain @xmath74 .",
    "analogously we derive consecutively @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "it is known that any minimal isothermal chart is harmonic , see e.g. @xcite . in our case",
    "this implies @xmath84 substituting these in @xmath85 and looking on the coefficients of @xmath86 and @xmath87 we obtain also @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "if @xmath90 the chart is not of degree 4 .",
    "so we assume @xmath91 . up to position in space and symmetry we may take @xmath92 now the coefficients of @xmath93 and @xmath94 in @xmath85 give @xmath95 and @xmath96 . using this",
    "we can calculate the derivatives @xmath97 and @xmath9 .",
    "let the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 give the weierstrass representation of the surface .",
    "denote by @xmath98 the derivative of @xmath99 .",
    "then @xmath100 in our case a direct computation shows @xmath101 on the other hand the weierstrass formula implies easily @xmath102 hence we derive @xmath103      g(z)&=&\\frac { c_{01 } + i c_{10 } + ( c_{11 } + 2 i c_{20 } + 3 ( - c_{03 } + i c_{30 } ) z ) z }      { a_{01 } -   i b_{01 } + i a_{10 } + b_{10 } + ( a_{11 } - i b_{11 } + 2 i a_{20 } + 2 b_{20 } ) z}\\cdot\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently we have obtained that for some complex constants @xmath104 and @xmath105 @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a polynomial of degree at most 2 .",
    "suppose @xmath108 , i.e. @xmath22 is a constant .",
    "then the derivative @xmath109 is of degree 2 or 4 , so the chart @xmath0 is of degree 3 or 5 , which is not our case .",
    "so @xmath110 .",
    "since @xmath111 is a polynomial then @xmath112 divides @xmath107 .",
    "hence @xmath113 , where @xmath114 .",
    "we have proved the following    [ th1 ] any bi - quartic parametric polynomial minimal surface in isothermal parameters is generated by the weierstrass formula with the functions @xmath115    further , we are interested which of the functions in theorem [ th1 ] generate different surfaces .",
    "denote by @xmath116 the chart defined as the real part of the weierstrass minimal curve with functions @xmath117 , @xmath47 and the corresponding surface by @xmath118 .",
    "denote also by @xmath0 the chart with generating functions @xmath119 , @xmath120 for arbitrary nonzero complex numbers @xmath104 , @xmath121 , and the corresponding surface by @xmath6 . using and",
    "we can see that the nonzero coefficients of the first fundamental form and the normal curvature of @xmath116 are respectively @xmath122 obviously @xmath116 is not in canonical principal parameters .",
    "we want to change the parameters @xmath19 to canonical principal ones .",
    "equation has a solution @xmath123 so according to theorem b we change the variable @xmath124 by @xmath125 .",
    "now the functions @xmath126 generate a chart @xmath127 in canonical principal parameters and @xmath128    analogously @xmath0 is not in canonical principal parameters . using again theorem b and changing the complex variable @xmath124 by @xmath129 we obtain a corresponding chart @xmath130 in canonical principal parameters . according to its normal curvature is @xmath131 the last formula implies that this is also the normal curvature ( in canonical principal parameters ) of the surface @xmath132 generating via the weierstrass formula by the functions @xmath133 according to theorem a the surfaces @xmath6 and @xmath132 coincide up to position in the space . on the other hand , the weierstrass formula implies that the surfaces @xmath118 and @xmath132 are homothetic .",
    "so for any nonzero complex numbers @xmath104 , @xmath105 the surface @xmath6 is , up to position in the space , homothetic to @xmath118 .",
    "surfaces of type @xmath6 for different values of @xmath104 and @xmath121 are shown in figure [ generating ] .     for different values of @xmath104 and @xmath121,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    generating  functions  f(z)=10z ,  g(z)=z        for different values of @xmath104 and @xmath121,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    generating  functions  f(z)=z ,  g(z)=10z    now we are interested whether the functions @xmath117 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , define a surface which is really different from @xmath118 .",
    "the chart @xmath0 generated by these functions is not in canonical principal parameters so according to theorem b we change the complex variable @xmath124 by @xmath125 .",
    "then the functions @xmath136 define a chart @xmath130 in canonical principal parameters .",
