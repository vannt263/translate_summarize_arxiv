    "the kinetics of submonolayer nucleation and island growth during the initial stage of epitaxial thin film growth has been studied intensively both experimentally and theoretically for more than three decades ( for reviews , see refs .  , and references therein ) .",
    "important aspects of the growth kinetics in the submonolayer growth regime can be described by the rate equations ( re ) approach.@xcite this approach has proven to be very valuable in inorganic thin film growth .",
    "interestingly , many of the theoretical concepts developed for thin film growth kinetics of inorganic materials , have shown recently to be very valuable also for applications in organic thin film growth.@xcite this is due to the fact that these concepts often are not specifically referring to particular materials . instead , they take into account the key mechanisms involved in the complex interplay of deposition , evaporation , diffusion , aggregation and dissociation from a general viewpoint .",
    "parameters entering the re are the capture numbers @xmath0 , which describe the strength of islands of size @xmath1 to capture adatoms at a coverage @xmath2 and ratio @xmath12 of the adatom diffusion coefficient @xmath4 and deposition flux @xmath5 .",
    "the dependence of the capture numbers on @xmath1 has been studied for various @xmath13 but only for one or a few @xmath2 values . in this work",
    "we present a systematic study of the full dependence on both @xmath2 and @xmath13 for different types of island morphologies and the case , where detachments of atoms from islands can be neglected , corresponding to a critical nucleus of size @xmath14 .",
    "this is motivated by the following questions , which have not been thoroughly answered yet :    * if the @xmath0 are known , do the re then predict correctly the number density @xmath6 of islands of size @xmath1 , that means the island size distribution ( isd ) ?",
    "this question indeed was earlier posed by ratsch and venables @xcite as well as evans _",
    "_ @xcite the answer to this question is not obvious , since the re with known capture numbers @xmath0 neglect many - particle correlation effects,@xcite spatial fluctuations in shapes and capture zones of islands , and coalescence events that , despite rare in the early - stage growth , can have a significant influence.@xcite * is there a simple functional form of the @xmath0 , in particular , is there a scaling of these capture numbers with respect to an effective capture length as suggested by a self - consistent treatment @xcite based on the re ?",
    "do the @xmath15 , when scaled with respect to their mean @xmath16 , depend for large @xmath13 on the scaled island size @xmath17 only , as suggested by bartelt and evans @xcite ?    in previous studies it has been found that the scaled isd @xmath18 as a function of scaled island size @xmath9 approaches , for fixed coverage @xmath2 , a scaling function @xmath19 for large @xmath13 .",
    "early simulations suggested that @xmath19 is independent of @xmath2 and moreover not sensitive to the island morphology .",
    "however , later results showed @xcite that the morphology has an influence on the form of @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , one would expect the scaling function @xmath19 to become independent of @xmath2 if the re with known capture numbers correctly predict the isd , and if the scaled capture numbers @xmath20 as a function of @xmath17 become independent of @xmath2 for large @xmath13 . under these assumptions ,",
    "an explicit relation was proposed by bartelt and evans,@xcite which connects the scaling function of the capture numbers with the scaling function of the isd .",
    "we hence address the following further questions :    * is the scaling function @xmath19 independent of @xmath2 for large @xmath13 ? what is the influence of the island morphology ? can the relation between the scaled isd @xmath19 and the scaling function for the capture numbers be confirmed ?    the re treatment is based on a coupled set of simple rate equations describing the time evolution of the adatom density @xmath21 and the number density @xmath22 of islands with size @xmath23 , if spatial correlations among islands during growth are neglected .",
    "taking into account direct impingement of arriving atoms at the border of islands , the re for the case @xmath14 read @xmath24 these equations refer to the pre - coalescence regime where only adatoms are mobile and it is presumed that re - evaporation of atoms and atom movements between the first and second layer can be disregarded . moreover , adatoms arriving on top of an island are not counted , i.e.  @xmath1 in a strict sense refers to the number of substrate sites covered by an island ( or the island area ) .",

    "the term @xmath28 describes the attachment of adatoms to islands of size @xmath29 , and the term @xmath30 the direct impingement of deposited atoms to boundaries of islands with size @xmath1 . for the idealized point island model",

    "( [ eq : n1 ] ) is replaced by one ( no covered substrate area ) .",
    "for a unified discussion of capture numbers and the isd we formally set @xmath32 for the point island model .    introducing the total number density of stable islands @xmath33 and the average capture number @xmath34 , @xmath35 a reduced set of equations for @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be derived from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : n1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ns ] ) within the re treatment .",

    "if the full dependence of the isd @xmath6 on @xmath2 and @xmath13 is mediated by the mean island size @xmath40 , the isd should obey the following scaling form , as first suggested by vicsek and family,@xcite @xmath41 here the scaling function @xmath19 must fulfill the conditions @xmath42 .",

    "[ sec : adatom_and_island_density ] we analyze the mean island and adatom densities for the different island morphologies and discuss their prediction by the self - consistent re and the re based on the capture numbers determined in the kmc simulations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : isd ] we demonstrate that the isd is successfully predicted by the re as long as coalescence events can be neglected .",
    "these coalescence events are relevant already for small coverages @xmath69 for compact morphologies , while they turn out to be much less important for fractal morphologies .",
    "the reason for these differences are reduced coalescence rates for fractal island morphologies because of a screening effect.@xcite finally , we study in sec .  [",
    "sec : scaling_theory ] the behavior of the scaled capture numbers and scaled isds in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "the kmc simulations are performed with a first reaction time monte carlo algorithm @xcite on a square lattice with @xmath70 sites . in this algorithm , two times @xmath71 and @xmath72 are randomly generated from the exponential probability density @xmath73 , where @xmath74 for @xmath71 , corresponding to a deposition process , and @xmath75 for @xmath72 , corresponding to one of the possible diffusive jumps of adatoms . if @xmath76 , the simulation time is incremented by @xmath72 and one of the @xmath77 adatoms is selected randomly and moved to a randomly selected vacant nearest neighbor site . if @xmath78 , the simulation time is incremented by @xmath71 and one of the @xmath79 sites is randomly chosen .",
    "if this site is vacant , an additional adatom is deposited on this site , while , if the site is occupied , no deposition takes place .    with respect to the formation of islands we consider three simple growth models that are representative for the different types of island morphologies in the case of @xmath14 .",
    "fractal islands are generated by applying `` hit and stick '' aggregation , that means an adatom having another atom as nearest neighbor becomes immobilized .",
    "compact island morphologies are produced by letting islands grow spirally into a quadratic form as in ref .",

    "main reason for these differences is that for point islands the number density @xmath33 continues to increase with @xmath2 ( that means time @xmath102 ) due to ongoing nucleation of new islands , while for compact and fractal morphologies , @xmath33 tends to saturate for larger @xmath2 , with less pronounced saturation in the compact case ( see sec .",

    "the larger island extension and the strong capture of adatoms by finger tips in the case of fractal islands lead to about five times larger @xmath15 in comparison to the compact islands .    the differences with respect to the @xmath2 dependence are also reflected in the behavior of @xmath98 in fig .",
