    "the observational infrastructure enabling the study of solar physics has seen dramatic advances over the past five years . among these , we highlight a few :    in 2009 , the two stereo spacecraft ( launched into earth - trailing and earth - leading orbits in 2006 ; @xcite ) passed the quadrature points relative to the sun - earth line .",
    "when combined with earth - perspective viewing , the following years enabled a view of the entire solar surface , for the first time in history showing us the evolution of an entire stellar atmosphere .    the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; @xcite ) on board the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo - launched in 2010 ; @xcite ) provides uninterrupted observing of the outer atmosphere of the entire earth - facing side of the sun at a cadence of 12s and a resolution of close to an arcsecond .",
    "combined with magnetography and helioseismology with the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; @xcite ) , as well as sun - as - a - star spectroscopy in the euv with the euv variability experiment ( eve ; @xcite ) , this powerful sdo spacecraft sends down well over 1tb / day .",
    "the primary data and higher - level derivatives fill a data archive that now exceeds 7pb and holds over 96%  of all data ever taken from space in the domain that focuses on the sun and the physics of the sun - earth connections .",
    "instrumentation with high spatial or spectral resolution is flown on the jaxa - led hinode / solar - b mission ( launched in 2006 ; @xcite ) and the nasa small explorer iris ( interface region imaging spectrograph , launched in 2013 ; @xcite ) that offer images with resolutions between 0.1 and 0.3arcsec , combined with spectroscopy in the visible and ultraviolet .",
    "rhessi @xcite , launched in 2002 , is continuing to provide unique spectroscopic images of the sun at high energy .",
    "these space - based instruments provide important access to the domain from photosphere to corona , critically complemented by ground - based telescopes and their instrumentation , as well as by rocket experiments such as hi - c @xcite .    in the optical domain , the 1.6 m new solar telescope ( nst , @xcite ) at big bear in the u.s.a .  and the 1.5-meter german gregor solar telescope at tenerife in spain @xcite have been in regular operation since 2012 .",
    "the 1-m new vacuum solar telescope ( nvst , @xcite ) at fuxian lake in southwest china is also in regular operation recently .",
    "crisp ( crisp imaging spectro - polarimeter ) at the swedish 1-m solar telescope ( sst ; ) reached 0.13arcsec spatial resolution and high polarimetric sensitivity aided by post - processing .",
    "all these telescopes have capacities close to their diffraction limit due to advanced designs and excellent seeing conditions .",
    "we have seen glimpses into very high - resolution ground - based coronal observing as well with , for the first time , synoptic observations of coronal stokes polarimetry in the near infrared by the coronal multichannel polarimeter ( comp , @xcite ) telescope .    in the radio domain ,",
    "the recently commissioned chinese spectral radioheliograph ( csrh ; ) at mingantu in inner mongolia of china ( renamed as mingantu ultrawide spectral radioheliograph - muser ) is a radioheliograph operating with the widest frequency range ever reached from 400mhz to 15ghz , with a high temporal , spatial , and spectral resolution .",
    "recent non - solar dedicated radio arrays such as the murchison wide - field array ( mwa , @xcite ) and the low - frequency array for radio astronomy ( lofar , @xcite ) have obtained spectroscopic solar imaging at metric and lower frequencies .",
    "the recently upgraded karl g.  jansky very large array ( evla ) has provided solar radio dynamic imaging spectroscopy of type iii bursts at decimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "even the millimeter domain and beyond is seeing major advances with the atacama millimeter / sub - millimeter array ( alma ; @xcite ) observatory coming on line for solar observing as it continues to complete its construction phase .",
    "the observations of tens of thousands of sun - like stars by the nasa kepler satellite is offering yet more insights into the physics of the sun , ranging from an improved understanding of internal structure and dynamics ( with asteroseismic techniques ) to a view of rare , extremely energetic flares .",
    "kepler data , with ground - based follow - up studies , suggest that solar flares may occur with energies up to several hundred times higher than observed directly in the past half century with space - based instrumentation @xcite .",
    "the volume of information that needs to be processed by solar researchers is increasing rapidly . in terms of data to be analyzed , we have definitely reached the petabyte era .",
    "this is true for observational data in the archives of sdo , but also in computer experiments in which single snapshot data dumps of the advanced codes can exceed a tb .",
    "a tendency towards open data policies means that we have ever more access to large volumes and a daunting diversity of data .",
    "that complicates finding , processing , and integrating data . infrastructure support for , for example ,",
    "the virtual solar observatory ( vso ) , solarsoft idl ( sswidl ) , and the heliophysics events knowledgebase and registry ( hek , her ) are critically important to enable efficient utilization of the growing data diversity and volume .",
    "the community lags in strategic thinking about these meta - infrastructural elements , both where current support and future expansion or replacement are concerned .",
    "there has also been a recent movement towards open - source data analysis software , with the development of the sunpy solar analysis environment in python @xcite .",
    "a similar flood of information is found with scientific publications , which exceed 2,000 refereed publications per year ( see above ) . here",
    ", the support infrastructure of ads is of critical value .",
    "the wide diversity of journals in which the works of colleagues are published requires subscription access to many publications , at costs that are increasingly hard to bear for relatively small research groups ; here , preprint services such as arxiv and maxmillennium play significant roles in making the community aware of what is going on .",
    "`` living reviews '' as offered by the free on - line journal living reviews in solar physics enable new researchers to understand the context of their work and established researchers in one sub - specialty a quick introduction into adjacent areas by their peers .    among the difficulties the solar activity community also faces",
    "is that many solar and inner - heliospheric events are studied by different groups and published in different journals .",
    "finding studies on a particular solar region of interest is hampered by inconsistent use of the characterizing spatio - temporal coordinates of events which may be found in abstract , main text , tables , appendices , and sometimes only marked in figures that are not machine - readable .",
    "the iau adopted a standard convention for this in 2009 ( @xcite ) in its sol standard ( short for solar object locator ) .",
    "its use is encouraged by journal editors including those of solar physics , the astrophysical journal , and the journal of geophysical research .",
    "broad usage of the sol standard would enable computer searches of related publications , enabling researchers to put new ( meta-)studies in broader contexts .",
    "for the highlights touched upon in this report , we opted for two criteria to identify topics of interest .",
    "one is to mention specific areas of note in the opinion of the organizing committee that may be new developments , are highly specialized yet significant , may concern new instrumentation or methods , or are otherwise deemed to be developments that may grow to see more activity in terms of publications in the near future .    the other criterion we applied is to be guided towards topics of frequent activity by the community itself by looking at the most cited works . such a selection does introduce a bias toward the papers published early in the period reviewed , of course , but our purpose is not to identify the most - cited works per se , but rather to find the dominant themes within the set of these works that apparently resonate strongly within the community already within the 3-y window from which they are selected .",
    "we searched for the most - cited refereed publications from ads with the terms `` solar.activity '' , `` coronal.mass.ejection '' , `` solar flare '' , `` solar prominence '' , or synonym(s ) in their abstracts in the period 2012 - 2014 . within this set , we identify the following themes ( sorted alphabetically ) : active - region magnetic fields ; coronal thermal structure ; coronal seismology ; solar flares and eruptions ; and the sun - in - time related aspects of long - term solar variability including cosmic - ray modulation .",
    "we close with a collection of developments , discoveries , and surprises .",
    "the photospheric magnetic field of active regions forms the foundation of the overlying atmosphere .",
    "its evolution   through emergence , displacement , and submergence of flux   is key to driving eruptive and explosive events in the corona and into the heliosphere . until recently ,",
    "generally only line - of - sight magnetic field maps were available for this work .",
    "nowadays , regular vector - magnetic determinations from the observed polarization signals are available from sources that include hinode , solis , and sdo / hmi .",
    "the sensitivity of such vector field maps allows the detection of lasting changes in the photospheric field when comparing pre- to post - flare observations ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "temporal resolution is so good that coronal events can be tightly bracketed to try to understand the causes of flares and eruptions , as well as the changes in energy and helicity involved ; for example , @xcite analyze a series of nonlinear force - free field models for the evolution in the energy of an active region around the time of a major eruption .",
    "the increasing availability of vector - magnetic data enables statistical studies on the properties of active regions and their activity heretofore possible only on line - of - sight magnetograms .",
    "for example , @xcite use a data base of vector field maps of over 2,000 active regions to train a machine - learning algorithm to attempt forecasting of large flares .",
    "@xcite review 3,000 vector field maps of some 60 regions to compare estimates of free energy with flare rates .",
    "@xcite analyze a sample of nearly 200 coronal mass ejections to reveal that flux , twist , and proxies for free energy tend to set upper limits to the speed of cmes emanating from the active regions studied .",
    "@xcite review hundreds of vector magnetograms of a sample of 80 active regions to study helicity and twist parameters to test for the influence of coriolis forcing .",
    "one long sought - after goal of flare and cme physics is to use models of the solar atmospheric field to understand why field configurations destabilize and under what conditions destabilization begins and proceeds . in a `` meta - analysis '' review , @xcite discuss recent developments , including the use of 3d field extrapolations that suggest that topological structures ( notably null points and hyperbolic flux tubes ) may be involved in the triggering and generally as tracers of reconnection processes early on .",
    "but even as the availability of vector - magnetic field maps becomes routine , the realization is growing that by themselves they appear insufficient to provide generally adequate lower - boundary conditions to understand the solar atmospheric activity .",
    "for example , a group of modelers using a variety of non - linear force - free field algorithms concludes in a series of studies ( see , _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) that snapshot vector - magnetic maps do not suffice to obtain a reliable coronal field model with accurate energy or helicity measurements , with effects of instrumental resolution and field of view , as well as the model geometry ( cartesian vs.  spherical ) all compounding the problems .",
    "new developments include the use of coronal loop observations to guide non - potential field models either from a single perspective as is possible currently ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) or by using stereoscopic data from existing or future space- based instrumentation such as stereo , solar orbiter , and sdo ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "methods to follow the evolution of active - region fields based on data driving are also being developed , using the uninterrupted stream of ( vector ) magnetograms now available from space - based platforms ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* based on the mhd - like magnetofrictional approximation ) , even reaching up to global mhd field models from near the solar surface into the heliosphere @xcite .",
    "others are developing mhd methods to study cme initiation based on observed surface field evolution ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "fundamental difficulties with these emerging methods include the difficulty in measuring the transverse field in areas of relatively low flux densities , the intrinsic 180-degree ambiguity in the field direction given a magnitude for the transverse component , the need to constrain the electric field to drive the model s evolution , and ultimately the quantitative comparison with solar observables to determine the verisimilitude of the model fields .",
    "even as our ability to observe and process rapidly growing data volumes on active region fields increases , we remain puzzled by the sun s atmospheric magnetic field : we have yet to understand how large amounts of energy can sometimes be stored to eventually be explosively converted into flares and cmes , while in other cases the energy is either not stored or is not explosively released . for a recent review of our understanding of the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere , and the variety of methods used to observe and study it , we refer to , and references therein .",
    "the x - ray solar corona is made of complex arrays of magnetic flux tubes anchored on both sides to the photosphere , confining a relatively dense and hot plasma .",
    "this optically thin plasma is almost fully ionized , with temperatures above 1mk , and emitting mostly in the extreme uv to x - rays with intensities proportional to the square of its density .",
    "significant progress was made in studying the physical and morphological features of coronal loops in a series of very successful euv and x - ray solar missions , since the first observational evidence of the presence of coronal loops provided by rocket missions in the mid-1960s @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", several solar missions were launched and started producing spectacular images and data in different spectral ranges .",
    "the high spatial and temporal resolution of these instruments and the complementarity between these data sets , poses new challenges to understand the heating and dynamics of coronal loops .",
    "the launch in 2010 of the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allows continuous observation of the whole sun with high temporal and spatial resolution with aia , eve , and hmi .",
    "in particular , aia images span at least 1.3 solar diameters in multiple wavelengths , at about 1arcsec in spatial resolution and at a cadence of about 10seconds .",
    "coronal loops observed by aia have been found to be highly variable and highly structured in space , time , and temperature , challenging the traditional view of these loops as isothermal structures and favoring the case for multi - thermal cross - field temperature distributions . because the thermal conductivity is severely reduced in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field",
    ", a spatially intermittent heating mechanism might give rise to a multi - threaded structure in the internal structure of loops .",
    "one possible example of such an intermittent heating process is mhd turbulence , which is expected to produce fine scale structuring within loops all the way beyond the resolution of current observations @xcite .",
    "a recent study by @xcite combining spectroscopic data from the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis , * ? ? ? * ) aboard hinode and sdo / aia images , shows that most of their loops must be composed of a number of spatially unresolved threads .",
    "more recently , the sounding rocket mission high - resolution coronal imager ( hi - c , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , achieved an unprecedented spatial resolution 0.2arcsec in euv images .",
    "@xcite find that the finely structured corona , down to the 0.2  resolution , is concentrated in the moss and in areas of sheared field , where the heating is intense .",
    "this result suggests that heating is on smaller spatial scales than aia and that it could be sporadic .",
    "these results are consistent with differential emission measure ( dem ) analysis that study the distribution of temperature across loops .",
    "@xcite present a systematic study of the differential emission measure distribution in active region cores , using data from eis and the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) aboard hinode .",
    "their results suggest that while the hot active region emission might be close to equilibrium , warm active regions may be dominated by evolving million degree loops in the core .",
    "more recently , @xcite used xrt and eis data as well as images from sdo / aia , and found that cooler loops tend to have comparatively narrower dem widths . while the dem distribution of warm loops could be explained through bundles of threads with different temperatures ,",
    "cooler loops are consistent with narrow dems and perhaps even isothermal plasma .",
    "the authors then speculate that warm , multi - thermal , multi - threaded loops might correspond to plasma being heated , while cool loops are composed of threads which have had time to cool to temperatures of about a million degrees , thus resembling a single isothermal loop .",
    "the interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was launched in 2013 , and provides crucial information to understand coronal heating , by tracing the flow of energy and plasma from the chromosphere and transition region up to the corona .",
    "iris obtains high resolution uv spectra and images with high spatial ( 0.33arcsec ) and temporal ( 1s ) resolution .",
    "recent iris observations show rather fast variations ( 20 - 60s ) of intensity and velocity on spatial scales smaller than 500 km at the foot points of hot coronal loops @xcite .",
    "these observations were interpreted as the result of heating by electron beams generated in small and impulsive heating events ( the so - called coronal nanoflares ) .",
    "theoretical models of coronal heating have been traditionally classified into ac or dc , depending on the time scales involved in the driving at the loop foot points : ( a ) ac or wave models , for which the energy is provided by waves at the sun s photosphere , with timescales much faster than the time it takes an alfvn wave to cross the loop ; ( b ) dc or stress models , which assume that energy dissipation takes place by magnetic stresses driven by slow foot point motions ( compared to the alfvn wave crossing time ) at the sun s photosphere .",
    "although these scenarios seem mutually exclusive , two common factors prevail : ( i ) the ultimate energy source is the kinetic energy of the sub - photospheric velocity field , ( ii ) the existence of fine scale structure is essential to speed up the dissipation mechanisms invoked @xcite . for a coronal heating mechanism to be considered viable",
    ", the input energy must be compatible with observed energy losses in active regions , estimated by @xcite to be @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite used high - resolution observations of plage magnetic fields made with the solar optical telescope aboard hinode to estimate the vertical poynting flux being injected into the corona , obtaining values of about @xmath1 , which suffices to heat the plasma .",
    "coronal seismology , like terrestrial seismology and traditional helioseismology , provides a means of probing the background state of the medium through which the waves propagate .",
    "although the corona is not hidden from view like the interiors of earth and sun , it is very difficult to directly measure plasma and magnetic properties such as density @xmath2 , magnetic field @xmath3 , or transport coefficients .",
    "observations of oscillations in the coronal plasma can potentially provide powerful constraints on these quantities , for example through the alfvn velocity @xmath4 ( _ e.g. _ , see the _ living review _ of * ? ? ?",
    "but unlike the solar interior and terrestrial examples where waves are but perturbations on the background state , the coronal seismic waves are crucially important to the energy balance of their host medium .",
    "coronal heating and solar wind acceleration are widely thought to result at least in part from waves @xcite .",
    "an overview of coronal seismology as of 2012 is provided by @xcite .",
    "the last 58 years have seen an explosion in coronal wave studies due to the advent of new instrumentation , such as the ground - based coronal multichannel polarimeter ( comp , * ? ? ? * ) and the space - based atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) on the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) . both have revealed ubiquitous alfvn - like ( i.e. , transverse to the magnetic field ) coronal oscillations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) , though the interpretation of their exact natures  alfvn or kink  is controversial @xcite .",
    "the term `` alfvnic '' is commonly used to encompass both wave types . in either case , the increased resolution of the aia observations @xcite has allowed the detection of sufficient oscillatory power to potentially power both the corona and solar wind @xcite , though precise mechanisms are not currently known with certainty .",
    "the concentration of oscillatory power in the few - minute period band , and in particular at around 5-minutes , strongly suggests a link with the sun s internal @xmath5-mode global oscillations .",
    "consistency in the estimation of alfvn speed between seismic techniques and magnetic field extrapolation is confirmed by @xcite using aia data from a flare - induced coronal loop oscillation .",
    "time - distance techniques applied to comp observations indicate a preponderance of outward propagating waves over inward propagation , even in closed loop structures , suggesting _ in situ _ dissipation ( or mode conversion ) on a timescale comparable to the alfvn crossing time @xcite .    disentangling alfvn and kink waves",
    "is addressed in depth by @xcite . in the magnetically structured solar atmosphere , the only true alfvn wave is torsional , and there is considerable interest in identifying these in observations because of the amount of energy they could potentially contribute to the outer atmosphere . however , being incompressive , alfvn waves are not seen in intensity , and torsional alfvn waves are also difficult to detect in doppler @xcite .",
    "recently though , 0.33-arcsec high - resolution observations of the chromosphere and transition region ( tr ) with nasa s interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris ) , coordinated with the swedish solar telescope , have revealed widespread twisting motions across quiet sun , coronal holes , and active regions alike that often seem to be associated with heating @xcite .",
    "this must presumably extend to the corona as well .",
    "dissipation of alfvn waves in the solar atmosphere has long been thought to rely largely on the generation of alfvn turbulence through nonlinear interaction between counter - propagating waves @xcite .",
    "observations with comp showing enhanced high - frequency power near the apex of coronal loops @xcite possibly supports this view .",
    "the presumed acceleration of the solar wind by alfvn turbulent energy deposition poses the challenge of identifying and explaining counter - propagating alfvn waves in open magnetic field regions required to produce that turbulence . @xcite",
    "confirm the presence of these counter - propagating waves using comp .",
    "these observations also provide evidence of a link to the @xmath5-mode spectrum , which presumably relies on magnetoacoustic - to - alfvn mode conversion occurring in the lower atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the solar chromosphere is where most of the energy of a solar flare is dissipated and radiated in bright linear structures called flare ribbons , and recent work on this topic has been dominated by observations from iris .",
    "the high spectral resolution available with iris shows complex spectral line profiles in the si iv transition region line at 1394  and 1403 sometimes with two or three time - varying gaussian components within one iris spatial pixel @xcite .",
    "the hot `` coronal '' line of fe xxi ( 1354 ) on the other hand shows only a single strongly blue - shifted component @xcite originating in compact ribbon sources at the beginning of a flare , with no hot `` stationary component '' present .",
    "the presence of this line also demonstrates the high temperatures reached by the chromosphere in flares as deduced from hinode / eis observations @xcite . with eis",
    ", we see 1.5 - 3mk redshifts @xcite confirming earlier reports , as well as significant non - thermal broadening .",
    "this means that the momentum - conserving condensation front that is produced by flare heating and paired with the evaporation flow contains hot plasma . in turn",
    "this implies that the condensation front originates relatively high in the chromosphere , otherwise such high temperatures would not be possible in the standard ( electron - beam - driven ) model of flares .",
    "this is somewhat at odds with recent measurements of element abundance @xcite which look more photospheric than coronal , suggesting that up - flowing evaporated material comes from low down in the chromosphere , below where the normal fractionation by first ionization potential sets in .",
    "flare optical ( or white - light ",
    "wl ) emission continues to be difficult to observe and difficult to explain .",
    "optical foot points characterized using 3-filter observations with hinode / sot @xcite could be explained by modest temperature increases of the photospheric black body .",
    "the other main proposed radiation mechanism is recombination emission , and flare continuum in the near uv ( beyond the balmer edge ) observed with iris has an intensity consistent with this @xcite , but the tell - tale balmer jump has not been seen .",
    "co - spatial hard x - ray ( hxr ) and white - light flare sources have been observed using rhessi and sdo / hmi , and require that both emissions are produced a few hundred kilometres above the photosphere @xcite , at a height corresponding to the temperature minimum region , and beyond the range expected for hxr - emitting electrons arriving from the corona ( unless the chromosphere is under - dense compared to expectations ) .",
    "it may be possible to generate optical emission from the temperature minimum region , for example by modest heating due to ion - neutral damping @xcite , but the presence of non - thermal electrons in this plasma is harder to explain . also indicating the flare s impact on the dense lower atmosphere , there have been many more reports of `` sun quakes ''   flare seismic emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )   but the mechanical driver remains uncertain ; there are correspondences with either hxr sources ( pressure pulses from electron - beam driven shocks ) or magnetic transients ( lorentz forces ) in some but not all cases .",
    "high - resolution ground - based flare observations using the new solar telescope at bbso show extraordinary fine structure , on a sub - arcsecond scale , in flare ribbons and footprints @xcite , setting the scene for future observations with dkist .",
    "examination of the changes in photospheric vector field occurring at the flare impulsive phase by @xcite using the hmi on sdo suggests strong , permanent and abrupt variations in the vertical component of the lorentz force at the photosphere consistent with a downward ` collapse ' of magnetic loops , and changes in the horizontal component mostly parallel to the neutral line in opposite directions on each side , indicating a decrease of shear near the neutral line .",
    "the brighter the flare ( as expressed in the goes class ) , the larger are both the total ( area - integrated ) change in the magnetic field and the change of lorentz force @xcite , although @xcite found that indicators of magnetic non - potentiality ( e.g. rotation , shear and helicity changes ) are more closely associated with flares   see for example the study of flare - associated rotating sunspots by @xcite . in the corona , imaging and spectroscopic observations show compelling evidence for plasma flows suggestive of those expected around a coronal reconnection region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the growing number of observed flares in archives and the increased coverage of flares in wavelength space and in domains from surface to heliosphere is enabling an improved assessment of energy budgets .",
    "for example , @xcite quantify energies of an ensemble of large , eruptive flares to find , among others that it appears that the energy in accelerated particles during the initial phases of the flare suffice to supply the energy eventually radiated in the flare across the spectrum , and that that total energy is statistically just under the bulk kinetic energy in associated coronal mass ejections .",
    "the central problem in solar flare theory remains the acceleration of the non - thermal electrons required to explain observed chromospheric hxr sources .",
    "observations with rhessi and sdo show that coronal electron acceleration can be very efficient ; @xcite find that essentially all electrons in a coronal source of density a few times @xmath6@xmath7 are energized to above around 10kev .",
    "kappa distributions , which are found to be a better fit than a standard thermal plus non - thermal distribution in coronal hxr sources @xcite , are shown to arise naturally in an acceleration region when there is a balance between diffusive acceleration and collisions , in the absence of significant escape from the acceleration region @xcite . in the electron - beam model of a flare",
    ", electrons must of course escape the corona to produce the chromospheric hxr sources , and the number flux requirements have always been somewhat problematic .",
    "this may be alleviated if electrons are boosted by wave - particle interactions in the corona ; a quasi - linear simulation of coronal electron propagation shows that wave - particle interaction with the high phase - velocity langmuir waves generated by density inhomogeneities can accelerate beam electrons to higher energies , reducing the requirement on electron flux at energies of a few tens of kev by up to a factor ten .",
    "study a model in which electrons are re - accelerated in the chromosphere , concluding that this also reduces demands on putative electron beam fluxes ( however requirements on the flare chromosphere energy source , not directly addressed in this model , remain the same ) .",
    "chromospheric ( re- ) acceleration models may also produce electron angular distributions which are more isotropic , consistent with the angular distributions inferred from inversion of rhessi mean electron flux spectra , accounting for photospheric x - ray albedo , by @xcite .",
    "a completely different view by @xcite is that the electron energization in flares takes place in a parallel electric field that develops close to or in the chromosphere , in a region of anomalous resistivity , if energy is transported alfvnically   specifically by inertial alfvn waves .",
    "however , the orthodoxy remains that energy transport is by electron beams , and this is now being tested against observations using beam - driven radiation hydrodynamics codes , the output of which can be compared with , for example , iris @xcite and eve and aia data , so far with mixed success .",
    "the understanding of the initiation and evolution of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) has tremendously profited from the combination of coronagraphic observations with high cadence imaging in the euv together with the multi - perspective view provided by the stereo mission , as well as from increasingly sophisticated mhd and thermodynamic modeling ( for reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "magnetic flux ropes play a key role in the physics of cmes .",
    "but there is a long debate whether flux ropes are pre - existing or formed during the eruption .",
    "@xcite observed the formation of a flux rope during a confined flare in high - cadence sdo / aia euv imagery . within hours after its formation , the flux rope became unstable and erupted resulting in a cme / flare event .",
    "for other cmes , for example those associated with quiescent prominence - cavity systems , a variety of observations indicate a pre - existing flux rope which may erupt bodily as a cme ( see e.g. figure 12 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite synthesized 16 years of coronagraphic and euv observations with mhd simulations , and found that flux ropes are a common structure in cmes ; in at least 40% a clear flux rope structure could be identified .",
    "in addition , they established a new `` two - front '' morphology consisting of a faint front followed by diffuse emission and the bright cme leading edge .",
    "the faint front is suggestive of a wave or shock front driven by the cme .",
    "the high - cadence six - passband sdo / aia euv imagery allows to perform differential emission measure ( dem ) analysis on solar flares and cmes to study their multi - thermal dynamics .",
    "it was shown that the cme core region , typically identified as the embedded flux rope , is hot ( 8  10 mk ) indicative of magnetic reconnection being involved .",
    "in contrast , the cme leading front has temperatures similar to the pre - eruptive corona but of higher densities suggesting that the front is a result of compression of the ambient coronal plasma .",
    "the hot flux rope is a key indicator to the physical processes involved in the early acceleration phase of the cme @xcite .",
    "the environment of cmes is important for the development of non - radial propagation .",
    "@xcite report that during solar minimum conditions cmes originating from high latitudes can be easily deflected toward the heliospheric current sheet , thus eventually becoming geo - effective .",
    "@xcite showed that coronal holes nearby the cme initiation site can cause strong deflections of cmes .",
    "modeling of the initiation of cmes continues to provide insights into the various forces and mechanisms that may be involved : initiation may involve the kink instability @xcite , sunspot rotation , reduction of tension of the overlying field @xcite , torus instability @xcite , and the breakout process @xcite . which dominates under which conditions and how commonly these occur remain topics of future work .      since their discovery by the soho / eit instrument about 15 years ago",
    ", there has been a vivid debate about the physical nature of large - scale euv waves , i.e.  whether they are true wave phenomena or propagating disturbances related to the magnetic restructuring due to the erupting cme . in the recent years",
    ", there has been tremendous progress in the understanding of these intriguing phenomena thanks to the unprecedented observations available , in particular the high - cadence euv imagery in six wavelengths bands by sdo / aia combined with the stereo multi - point view which allowed for the first time to follow euv waves in full - sun maps @xcite .",
    "there seems now relatively broad consensus that large - scale euv waves are often fast - mode magnetosonic waves ( of large amplitude or shocks ) , driven by the strong lateral expansion of the cme ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a number of detailed case studies revealed that the cme lateral front and the euv wave appear originally co - spatial .",
    "but when the lateral cme expansion slows down , the euv wave decouples from the driver and then propagates freely , adjusting to the local fast - mode speed of the medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "three - dimensional thermodynamic mhd modeling of well observed euv waves also supports these findings , showing the outer fast - mode euv wave front followed by another bright front indicating the cme component @xcite .",
    "statistical studies of euv waves based on sdo / aia @xcite and stereo / euvi data @xcite revealed euv wave speeds that range from close to the fast magnetosonic speed in the quiet corona to values well above , the fastest ones exceeding 1000  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "@xcite showed that at least half of the euv waves under study show significant deceleration , and a distinct anti - correlation between the starting speed and the deceleration , providing further evidence for a freely propagating fast - mode wave .",
    "the association rate of euv waves with type ii bursts , which are indicative of shock waves in the solar corona , may be as high as 50% @xcite .",
    "detailed case studies provided a number of further characteristics suggestive of the wave nature , such as reflection and refraction of euv waves at coronal holes and active regions , transmission into coronal holes as well as the initiation of secondary waves by the arrival of the wave at structures of high alfvn speed @xcite and for one case , @xcite have evaluated the euv wave s initial energy using a blast - wave approximation , to be around 10%  of that of the associated cme .",
    "@xcite discovered quasi - periodic fast - mode wave trains within a large - scale euv wave with a periodicity of 2  min , running ahead of the laterally expanding cme flanks .",
    "@xcite presented the first simultaneous observations of the propagation of a large - scale euv wave and an h@xmath9 moreton wave , showing that the wave fronts evolve co - spatially indicating that they are both signatures of a fast magnetosonic wave pulse .",
    "the stereo mission , often in combination with soho / lasco , offers observations of cmes all the way from their origin on the sun , and of their propagation in interplanetary space to beyond 1au from outside the sun - earth line .",
    "these data combined with a multitude of other in - situ space missions have been vividly used to connect remote sensing cme observations to the field and plasma data observed by in - situ spacecraft , to constrain models of interplanetary cme propagation , to study cme - cme interaction , and to forecast cme arrival times and speeds with the ultimate aim improving the prediction of their geo - effectiveness .",
    "@xcite and @xcite tracked a flux rope all the way from its solar origin to its in - situ signatures at 1au using the stereo secchi euv imagers , coronagraphs and wide - angle heliospheric imagers .",
    "they establish that the cavity in the classic three - part cme is the feature that becomes the magnetic cloud , implying material ahead of the cavity is piled - up material from the corona or the solar wind .",
    "modeling of the interplanetary propagation of cmes makes use of empirical , analytic and numerical approaches .",
    "the analytical  drag - based model \" ( dbm ) is based on the hypothesis that the lorentz forces driving a cme eruption ceases in the upper corona and that beyond a certain distance the interplanetary cme ( icme ) dynamics is governed solely by the interaction of the icme and the ambient solar wind plasma @xcite . from the observational side , a variety of reconstruction methods have been developed and applied to the heliospheric imager data including one- as well as two - spacecraft ( stereoscopic ) observations and inclusion of in - situ data and radio type ii bursts to better constrain the propagation direction , distance and speed profile of cmes in interplanetary space @xcite .",
    "these efforts result in comparable typical uncertainties in the cme arrival time of about half a day @xcite .",
    "studies using stereo heliospheric imager data and in - situ plasma and field measurements established that the interaction of cmes in the inner heliosphere , due to a faster cme launched after a slower one , seems to be a common and important phenomenon @xcite . the interaction process may cause deflection or merging of cmes , and either deceleration or acceleration of merged cme fronts ( including heating and compression ) .",
    "@xcite , reporting in a fast cme causing an extreme storm , speculate that the interaction between two successively launched cmes resulted in the extreme enhancement of the magnetic field of the ejecta that was observed in - situ near 1au .      the unusually deep and temporally - extended activity minimum between sunspot cycles 23 and 24 , followed by a slowly rising and low amplitude cycle 24 , has led to renewed interest in the underlying causes of solar cycle fluctuations , including grand minima .",
    "much attention has focused on the so - called babcock - leighton solar cycle models , in which the regeneration of the solar surface dipole takes place via the decay of active regions .",
    "most extant versions of these dynamo models are geometrically ( axisymmetric ) and dynamically ( kinematic ) simplified , yet they do remarkably well at reproducing many observed solar cycle characteristics ( see , _ e.g. _ , karak _ et al .",
    "_ 2014 , and references therein ) .",
    "explanations for the extended cycle 23 - 24 minimum and low amplitude cycle 24 have been sought in terms of variations in the meridional flow expected to thread the solar convection zone ( upton and hathaway 2014 ) , and patterns of active region emergence and associated feedback on surface flows ( cameron _ et al .",
    "_ 2014 ; jiang _ et al .",
    "these successes of the babcock - leighton modelling framework have however been challenged by helioseismic measurements ( zhao _ et al .",
    "_ 2013 ; schad _ et al .",
    "_ 2013 ) indicating that the meridional flow within the convection zone has a far more complex cellular structure than assumed in the majority of these mean - field - like solar cycle models .",
    "possible avenues out of this conundrum are being explored ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , hazra _ et al .",
    "_ 2014 ; belucz _ et al .",
    "_ 2015 ) .",
    "much effort has also been invested in implementing various form of data assimilation schemes in dynamo models , with the aim of achieving improved forecasting of the amplitude and timing of future sunspot cycles . at this point in time",
    "no existing dynamo model - based forecasting scheme has done significantly better than the known precursor skill of the solar surface magnetic dipole moment at times of cycle minima , nonetheless progress is likely forthcoming in this area .",
    "global magnetohydrodynamical simulations of solar convection have also progressed rapidly in recent years , with many research groups worldwide now running simulations producing large - scale magnetic fields undergoing polarity reversals ( _ e.g. _ masada _ et al .",
    "_ 2013 ; nelson _ et al .",
    "_ 2013 ; fan and fang 2014 ; passos and charbonneau 2014 ; warnecke _ et al .",
    "_ 2014 ) . due to computing limitations all these simulations",
    "run in parameter regimes still far removed from solar interior conditions .",
    "nonetheless , many are producing tantalizingly solar - like features , including rotational torsional oscillations ( beaudoin _ et al .",
    "_ 2013 ) equatorward propagation of activity `` belts '' ( kpyl _ et al .",
    "_ 2012 ; warnecke _ et al .",
    "_ 2014 ; augustson _ et al .",
    "_ 2015 ) cyclic in - phase magnetic modulation of convective energy transport ( cossette _ et al .",
    "_ 2013 ) and grand minima - like interruptions of cyclic behavior ( augustson _ et al .",
    "one particularly interesting feature is the spontaneous production of magnetic flux tube - like structures within the convection zone , as reported in nelson _",
    "these were found to rise to the top of the simulation domain , partly through magnetic buoyancy , while maintaining their orientation in a manner compatible with hale polarity laws ( nelson _ et al .",
    "this has revived the idea that dynamo action could be wholly contained within the solar convective envelope , rather than relying on the tachocline for the formation and storage of the magnetic flux ropes eventually giving rise to sunspots .",
    "major efforts have also taken place in reinterpreting and reanalyzing historical observations of magnetic activity .",
    "noteworthy in this respect are the analyses of tilt angle patterns for bipolar magnetic regions ( see pavai _",
    "_ 2015 , and references therein ) , and reanalysis of polar faculae data by munoz - jaramillo _ et al . _",
    "( 2012 ) . of particular importance",
    "is the recently completed revision of the international sunspot number ( ssn ) time series .",
    "ssn values for the period 1947-present now account for a discontinuity in the manner of counting spot groups having occurred at the locarno reference station ( clette _ et al .",
    "correcting for this leads to a significant ( @xmath10% ) decrease in ssn values during the space era .",
    "consequently , reconstructions of solar activity into the distant past using the ssn as a backbone to extrapolate space - borne measurements will need to be reassessed .",
    "radionuclides generated by the atmospheric impact of galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) provide a crucial proxy for the evolution in the sun s activity @xcite on time scales longer than a few years or a decade , depending on the radionuclide and its deposition in terrestrial natural archives .",
    "new ice core data on @xmath11be and tree ring data on @xmath12c have been combined to provide better understanding of climate impacts on these records : a joint analysis of composite tree ring data with ice cores from greenland and antarctica have enabled the separation of the common signal ( assumed to be dominated by solar and heliospheric variability ) from terrestrial variability @xcite . from this , we now have 94 centuries of data on a proxy for solar activity . but translating that proxy into details of solar activity that may drive space weather and terrestrial climate remains a challenge , as reviewed by , _",
    "e.g. _ .      and",
    "then , of course , there were numerous surprising realizations and discoveries , in the real world as much as in the rapidly growing virtual world ) .",
    "we mention merely a small sampling in no particular order : a weak solar cycle following an uncommonly low and long solar minimum @xcite ; a series of x - class flares from ar12192 none of which were associated with a cme , contrasting with statistics to date @xcite ; use of a sun - grazing comet to probe the high corona and its connection to the innermost heliosphere @xcite ; an extremely large amount of dense , cool plasma falling back onto the sun following a massive filament eruption providing a close - up example of distant accretion processes @xcite ; reports of enormously energetic flares from what would appear to be sun - like stars @xcite and potential evidence for strong sep events associated with very energetic solar flaring from @xmath12c records albeit without obvious auroral counterparts ; the successful creation of realistic looking sunspots in the computer @xcite ; the revision of sunspot numbers that suggests no long - term increase in solar activity occurred over the past few hundred years @xcite ; radiative magneto - convective simulations have reached resolution scales of a few kilometers , and suggest comparable energy densities in magnetic and kinetic reservoirs @xcite ; iris observations uncovering rapidly - evolving low - lying loops at transition region temperatures , heretofore inferred from emission measure studies but never yet observed @xcite ; a new model was proposed for coronal heating based on magnetic gradient pumping @xcite ; non - potential field models for a continuously - driven corona over a 16-year period was achieved @xcite ; a solar eruption in july of 2012 that would likely have powered a century - level extreme geomagnetic storm , as for the carrington - hodgson flare of 1859 , had it enveloped earth @xcite ; the realization that stokes theorem combined with the induction equation could explain why polar fields should be a good indicator for the strength of the next sunspot cycle @xcite ; the simulation of a sequence of homologous cmes and demonstration of so - called `` canniballistic '' behavior @xcite ; the discovery of nested toroidal line - of - sight flows and `` lagomorphic '' coronal polarimetric signatures within coronal cavities indicating the presence of magnetic flux ropes @xcite ; rapidly rotating magnetic structures ( `` magnetic tornadoes '' ) have been identified , which provide a channel of energy and twist from the solar surface to the corona @xcite ; and the x - class flare sol2014 - 03 - 29 t made history by becoming `` the best - observed flare of all time '' ( http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-telescopes-coordinate-best-ever-flare-observations/#.vhj4trq9yow[according to nasa ] ) as the ground - based dunn solar telescope and the space - based iris , rhessi , and sdo all observed it in detail .",
