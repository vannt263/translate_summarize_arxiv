    "the wealth of literature on tone and intonation has amply demonstrated that voice pitch ( f@xmath0 ) in speech is under independent linguistic control . in english ,",
    "voice pitch alone can signal the distinction between a statement and a question .",
    "similarly , in many tone languages , voice pitch alone signals the tense of a verb .",
    "phonologists usually describe a pitch contour much as they describe speech more generally , namely as a sequence of discrete units ( i.e.  a transcription ) .",

524,100 ) ( 525,100 ) ( 526,100 ) ( 527,99 )    the question addressed in this paper concerns how we should relate pitch contours to tone sequences .",
    "this paper is divided into four main sections , summarised in turn below .",
    "tone transcription : :    in this section i present the problem of relating sequences of    f@xmath0 values to tone transcriptions .",
    "i argue that hidden    markov models are unsuited to the task and i demonstrate the    importance of having a computational tool which allows phonologists to    experiment with f@xmath0 scaling parameters . f@xmath0",
    "scaling : :    this section gives a mathematical basis for a general approach to    f@xmath0 scaling which , it is hoped , will be applicable to    any tone language .",
    "i derive an f@xmath0 prediction function    from first principles and show how the model of for the nigerian    language igbo is a special case . tone and f@xmath0 in bamileke dschang : :    present some data from my own fieldwork and give a statistical    analysis , using the same technique used by liberman et al .",
    "i then show    how the general model of the previous section is instantiated for this    language .",
    "this demonstrates the versatility of the general model ,    since it can be applied to two very different tone languages .",
    "implementations : :    this section provides two non - deterministic techniques for    transcribing an f@xmath0 string .",
    "the first method uses a    genetic algorithm while the second method uses simulated annealing .",
    "the performance of both implementations is evaluated and compared on a    range of artificial and real data .",
    "finally , i give some examples of    multiple , automatically - generated transcriptions of the same    f@xmath0 data .",
    "a promising way of generating contours from tone sequences is to specify one or more pitch targets per tone and then to interpolate between the targets ; the task then becomes one of providing a suitable sequence of targets @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps less clear how we should go about recognising tone sequences from pitch contours .",
    "hidden markov models ( hmms ) offer a powerful statistical approach to this problem , though it is unclear how they could be used to recognise the units of interest to phonologists .",
    "hmms do not encode timing information in a way that would allow them to output , say , one tone per syllable ( or vowel ) .",
    "moreover , the same section of a pitch contour may correspond to either h or l tones .",
    "for example , a h between two hs looks just like an l between two ls . there is no principled upper bound on the amount of context that needs to be inspected in order to resolve the ambiguity , leading to a multiplication of state information required by the hmm and problems for training it .    in the present context ,",
    "the emphasis is not on automatic speech recognition but on a tool to support phonologists working with tone . as we shall see in the next section , once the phonologist has identified the salient location to measure the ` f@xmath0 value ' of a syllable ( or some other phonological unit )",
    ", the task will be to automatically map a string of these values to a string of tones .",
    "connell and ladd have devised a set of heuristics for identifying key points in an f@xmath0 contour to record f@xmath0 values @xcite . in the absence of a program which enshrines these heuristics ,",
    "it was decided to develop a system for producing a tone transcription from a sequence of f@xmath0 values .",
    "apart from the obvious benefits of automating the process , such as speed and accuracy , it could show up cases where there is more than one possible tone transcription , possibly with different parameter settings for the f@xmath0 scaling function .",
    "having the _ set _ of tone transcriptions that are compatible with an utterance has considerable value to an analyst searching for invariances in the tonal assignments to individual morphemes .    to exemplify this point",
    ", it is worth considering a recent example where an alternative transcription of some data proved valuable in providing a fresh analysis of the data . in their analyses of tone in bamileke dschang",
    ", hyman gives the transcription in ( [ ex : machete - dogs]a ) while stewart gives the one in ( [ ex : machete - dogs]b ) , for the phrase meaning .",
    "[ ex : machete - dogs ]     @xcite     @xcite    these two possibilities exist because of different f@xmath0 _ scaling parameters_. these parameters determine the way in which the different tones are scaled relative to each other and to the speaker s pitch range .",
    "this is illustrated in ( [ ex : hyman - interp ] ) , adapting hyman s earlier notation @xcite .",
    "[ ex : hyman - interp ]    hyman : +    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     i therefore conclude that the presence of more than one table for @xmath5 indicates an interplay between @xmath5 values and the ratio @xmath6 .",
    "this raises an interesting question .",
    "suppose we have two tone sequences @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and two interpretation functions @xmath1 and @xmath9 based on @xmath5 and @xmath10 respectively",
    ". then under what circumstances is the phonetic interpretation of both sequences the same under their respective interpretation functions ?",
    "a sufficient condition for them to be the same is that @xmath11 and that @xmath12 .",
    "the reader can check that these conditions are met by the mapping in ( [ ex : mapping ] ) and the two tables for @xmath5 given above .",
    "note that this observation holds for the model in general , not just for the specialised version of the model as applied to bamileke dschang .",
    "it can also be shown that @xmath5 is completely determined once @xmath13 is specified .",
    "a possible characterisation of total vs.  partial downstep now arises : if @xmath14 then we have total downstep , but if @xmath15 then we have partial downstep .",
    "however , the interpretation of these terms must necessarily be different from the standard interpretation , since i have shown that the standard interpretation is not compatible with the present model .",
    "this concludes the discussion of f@xmath0 scaling in bamileke dschang .",
    "i shall now present the implementations .",
    "in this section , i show how it is possible to get two programs to produce a sequence of tones @xmath3 ( i.e.  a tone transcription ) given a sequence of @xmath16 f@xmath0 values @xmath2 .",
    "the programs make crucial use of the prediction function @xmath1 in evaluating candidate tone transcriptions .    both programs involve search , and in general , the aim in searching is to discover the values for @xmath17 so as to optimise the value of a specified evaluation function @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath19 has many local optima , deterministic methods such as hill - climbing perform poorly .",
    "this is because they terminate in a local optimum and the particular one found depends heavily on the starting point in the search , and there is usually no way of choosing a good starting point .",
    "exhaustive search for the global optimum is not an option when the search space is prohibitively large . in the present context ,",
    "say for a sequence of 20 tones , the search space contains @xmath20 possible tone transcriptions , and for each of these there are thousands of possible parameter settings , too large a search space for exhaustive search in a reasonable amount of computation time .",
    "_ non - deterministic search methods _ have been devised as a way of tackling large - scale combinatorial optimisation problems , problems that involve finding optima of functions of discrete variables .",
    "these methods are only designed to yield an approximate solution , but they do so in a reasonable amount of computation time .",
    "the best known such methods are genetic search @xcite and annealing search @xcite .",
    "recently , annealing search has been successfully applied to the learning of phonological constraints expressed as finite - state automata @xcite . in the following sections i describe a genetic algorithm and an annealing algorithm for the tone transcription problem .      for a cogent introduction to genetic search and an explanation of why it works ,",
    "the reader is referred to . before presenting the version of the algorithm used in the implementation",
    ", i shall informally define the key data types it uses along with the standard operations on those types .",
    "gene : :    a linear encoding of a solution . in the present setting",
    ", it is an    array of @xmath16 tones , where each tone is one of h , h , h , l ,    l or l. a gene also contains 16 bit encodings of the parameters    @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these encodings    were scaled to be floating point numbers in the range    @xmath24 $ ] for @xmath21 , @xmath25 $ ] for    @xmath22 and @xmath26 $ ] for @xmath23 .",
    "gene pool : :    an array of genes , @xmath27 .",
    "one of the search parameters is    the size of @xmath27 , known as the _ population_. the gene pool    is renewed each generation , and the number of generations is another    search parameter .",
    "evaluation : :    a measure of the fitness of a gene as a solution to the problem .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is the sequence of f@xmath0    values we wish to transcribe .",
    "suppose also that @xmath3 is a    particular gene .",
    "the the evaluation function is as follows :    @xmath28 crossover : :    this is an operation which takes two genes and produces a single gene    as the result .",

    "@xmath34 in other words , the genes @xmath35 and    @xmath36 are cut at a position determined by @xmath32    and the first part of @xmath35 is spliced with the second part    of @xmath36 to create a new gene .",
    "crossover builds in the idea    that good genes tend to produce good offspring . to see why this is so",
    ",    suppose that the transcription contained in the first part of    @xmath35 is relatively good while the rest is poor , while the    transcription contained in the first part of @xmath36 is poor    and the rest is relatively good .",
    "then the offspring containing the    first part of @xmath35 and the second part of @xmath36    will be an improvement on both @xmath35 and @xmath36 ;    other possible offspring from @xmath35 and @xmath36 will    be significantly worse and may not survive to the next generation .",

    "the resulting gene is optimal    since we choose the crossing points in such a way as to minimise    @xmath37 at each    position . in developing the system , exploiting",
    "the decomposability of    the evaluation function in this way caused a significant improvement    in system performance over the version which used simple crossover .",
    "breeding : :    for each generation , we create a new gene pool from the previous one .",
    "each new gene is created by mating the best of three randomly chosen    genes with the best of three other randomly chosen genes .",
    "mutation : :    in order to maintain some _ genetic diversity _ and an element of    randomness throughout the search ( rather than just in the initial    configuration ) , a further operation is applied to each gene in every    generation . with a certain probability ( known as the _ mutation    probability _ ) , for each gene @xmath3 and each tone in    @xmath3 ,",
    "the tone is randomly set to any of the six possible    tones .",
    "likewise , the parameter encodings are mutated .",
    "the mutation    rate is set to 0.005 but raised to 0.5 for a single generation if the    evaluation of the best gene is no improvement on the evaluation of the    best gene ten generations earlier .",

    "the building blocks of genetic search discussed above are structured into the following algorithm , expressed in pseudo - pascal :    xxxxxxxxxxxx + begin + pool , newpool ; + for g : = 1 to generations do + begin + if * good_performance*(10 ) then + mutation_rate : = 0.005 ; + else + mutation_rate : = 0.5 ; + newpool[1 ] : = * find_best_gene*(pool ) ; + for n : = 2 to population do + begin + gene1 : = * best_of_three*(pool ) ; + gene2 : = * best_of_three*(pool ) ; + newpool[n ] : = * crossover*(gene1 , gene2 ) ; + ( newpool[n ] , mutation_rate ) ; + end + pool : = newpool ; + ( pool ) ; + end + write * find_best_gene*(pool ) ; + end    the main loop is executed for each generation . each time through this loop , the program checks performance over the last ten generations and if performance has been good , the mutation rate stays low , otherwise it is changed to high .",
    "then it copies the best gene to the new pool .",
    "now we reach the inner loop , which selects two genes , performs crossover , and mutates the result .",
    "next , the current pool is updated , an evaluation is performed , and the program continues with the next generation .",
    "once all the generations have been completed , the program displays the best gene from the final population and terminates .      as with genetic algorithms ,",
    "simulated annealing @xcite is a combinatorial optimisation technique based on an analogy with a natural process .",
    "_ annealing _ is the heating and slow cooling of a solid which allows the formation of regular crystalline structure having a minimum of excess energy . in its early stages when the temperature is high , annealing search resembles random search .",
    "there is so much free energy in the system that a transition to a higher energy state is highly probable .",
    "as the temperature decreases the search begins to resemble hill - climbing .",
    "now there is much less free energy and so transitions to higher energy states are less and less likely . in what follows ,",
    "i explain some of the parameters of annealing search as used in the current implementation .",
    "temperature : :    at the start of the search the temperature , @xmath38 is set to    1 . during the search ,",
    "the temperature is reduced at a rate set by the    ` cooling rate ' parameter , until it reaches a value less than    @xmath39 .",
    "perturbation : :    at each step of the search , the current state is perturbed by an    amount which depends on the temperature .",
    "the temperature determines    the fraction of the search space that is covered by a single    perturbation step . for a tone sequence of length @xmath16 ,",
    "we    randomly reset the worst @xmath40 tones according to    @xmath37 . for the    parameters we proceed as follows , here exemplified for    @xmath21 .",
    "first , set    @xmath41 .",
    "now , add to @xmath21 a random number in the range    @xmath42 $ ] and check that the result is still in the    range    @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "equilibrium : :    at each temperature , the system is required to reach ` thermal    equilibrium ' before the temperature is lowered . in the present    context , equilibrium is reached if no more than one of the last eight    perturbations yielded a new state that was accepted .",
    "free energy function : :    this is the amount of available energy for transitions to higher    energy states .",
    "in the current system , it is the distribution    @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a uniform    random variable in the range @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "if the energy    difference @xmath47 between an old and a new state is less    than the available energy , then the transition is accepted .",
    "the factor    of 1000 is intended to scale the energy distribution to typical values    of the evaluation function .",
    "now the algorithm itself is presented :    xxxxxxxxxx= xx + begin + trans , newtrans , besttrans ; + trans ; + t : = 1 ; + while t @xmath48 0.000001 do + begin + repeat + newtrans : = * perturb*(trans , t ) ; + @xmath47 : = * evaluate*(newtrans ) + @xmath49 * evaluate*(trans ) ; + if @xmath50 or + exp(@xmath51/1000.t ) @xmath48 random(0,1 ) then + trans : = newtrans ; + if * evaluate*(trans ) @xmath52 * evaluate*(besttrans ) + besttrans : = trans ; + until * equilibrium_reached * ; + trans : = besttrans ; + temperature : = temperature / 1.2 ; + end + write trans ; + end    the program is made up of two loops .",
    "the outer loop simply iterates through the temperature range , beginning with a temperature of 1 and steadily decreasing it until it gets very close to zero .",
    "the nested loop performs the task of reaching thermal equilibrium at each temperature .",
    "the first step is to perturb the previous transcription to make a new one .",
    "notice that the temperature @xmath38 is a parameter of the perturb function .",
    "next , the difference @xmath47 between the old and new evaluations is calculated .",
    "if the new transcription has a better evaluation than the old one , then @xmath47 is negative .",
    "next , the program accepts the new transcription if ( i ) @xmath47 is negative or ( ii ) @xmath47 is positive and there is sufficient free energy in the system to allow the worse transcription to be accepted . finally , we check if the new transcription is better than the best transcription found so far ( besttrans ) and if so , we set besttrans to be the new transcription .",
    "once equilibrium is reached , the current transcription is set to be the best transcription found so far , and the search continues .",
    "both the genetic and annealing search algorithms have been implemented in . in this section , the performance of the two implementations",
    "is compared .",
    "performance statistics are based on 1,200 executions of each program .",
    "search parameters were set so that each execution took around 5 seconds on a sun sparc 10 .",
    "three performance trials were undertaken .    in the first trial",
    ", both programs generated random sequences of tones , then computed the corresponding f@xmath0 sequence using @xmath1 , then set about transcribing the f@xmath0 sequence .",
    "since these sequences were ideal , the best possible evaluation for a transcription was zero .",
    "the performance of the programs could then be measured to see how close they came to finding the optimal solution .",
    "each program was tested on f@xmath0 sequences of length 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 . for each length ,",
    "each program transcribed 100 randomly - generated sequences .",
    "the results are displayed in figure 6 .",
    "each pair of bars corresponds to a given transcription length .",
    "the left member of each pair is for the genetic search program , while the right member is for the annealing search program .",
    "the heavily shaded bars corresponding to evaluations less than 1 are the most important .",
    "these indicate the number of times out of 100 that the programs found a transcription with an evaluation less than 1 .",
    "this evaluation means that the average of the squared difference between the predicted f@xmath0 values and the actual f@xmath0 values was less than 1hz .",
    "observe that the annealing search program performs significantly better in all cases .",
    "note that the mutation operation in the genetic search program treats each bit in the parameter encodings equally , while the perturbation operation in the annealing search program is sensitive to the distinction between more significant vs.  less significant bits .",
    "this may explain the better convergence behaviour of the annealing search .",
    "notice also in figure 6 that performance does not degrade with transcription length as the length doubles from 10 to 20 .",
    "this is probably because a randomly generated sequence will contain downsteps on every second tone ( on average ) causing a general downtrend in the f@xmath0 values and severely limiting the combinatorial explosion of possible transcriptions .",
    "trial 2 was the same as trial 1 except that this time upstep was permitted as well .",
    "the results are displayed in figure 7 .    again the annealing program fares better than the genetic program .",
    "consider again the bars corresponding to evaluations less than 1 .",
    "for both programs , however , observe that the performance degrades more uniformly than in trial 1 , probably because the inclusion of upstep greatly increases the number of possible transcriptions ( and hence , the number of local optima ) .",
    "the final trial involved real data , including data from the utterance given in figure 1 .",
    "this trial involved four subtrials .",
    "the first and second had f@xmath0 sequences of length 10 , while the third and fourth had length 18 and 19 .",
    "the first and second sequences were taken by extracting the initial 10 f@xmath0 values from the third and fourth sequences , thereby avoiding the asymptotic behaviour of the longer sequences .",
    "the data is tabulated below , and it comes from the sentences in ( [ ex : data ] ) .",
    "performance results are given in figure 8 .",
    "notice that the interpretation of the shading in this figure is different from that in previous figures .",
    "this is because evaluations near zero were less likely with real data .",
    "in fact , the annealing program never found an evaluation less than 3 while the genetic program never found an evaluation less than 4 .    since the programs performed about equally on finding transcriptions with an evaluation less than 7",
    ", i shall display these transcriptions along with an indication of how many times each program found the transcription ( g  =  genetic , a  =  annealing ) .",
    "i give transcriptions which occurred at least twice in one of the programs , during 100 executions of each .",
    "the results from trial 1 deserve special attention . in trial 1 ,",
    "three transcriptions were found by both programs .",
    "the best evaluations found are given below :    it is striking to note that the first two transcriptions above are what hyman and stewart ( respectively ) would have given as transcriptions for the abstract f@xmath0 sequence .",
    "this is demonstrated in ( [ equiv]a , b ) .",
    "the third transcription points to another possibility , given in ( [ equiv]c ) .    # 1@xmath53    [ equiv ]    * hyman s transcription scheme * +    * 10@c h & l & h & l & h & l & h & l & h & l + 1 & 3 & 1 & 3 & 1 & 3 & 1 & 3 & 1 & 3 + 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 + 1 & 3 & 2 & 4 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 6 & 5 & 7    * stewart s transcription scheme * +    * 10@c h & l & h & l & h & l & h & l & h & l + 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 + 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 5 + 1 & 3 & 2 & 4 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 6 & 5 & 7    * novel transcription scheme * +    * 10@c h & l & h & l & h & l & h & l & h & l + 1 & & 1 & & 1 & & 1 & & 1 & + 0 & & 1 & & 2 & & 3 & & 4 & + 1 & 3 & 2 & 4 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 6 & 5 & 7    therefore , there are encouraging signs that the program is living up to its promise of producing alternative , equally acceptable transcriptions , as desired from an analytical standpoint .",
    "although we have seen more than one transcription for a given f@xmath0 sequence , it is inconvenient to be required to run the programs several times in order to see if more than one solution can be found . furthermore , the programs are designed not to get caught in local optima , which is a problem since interesting alternative transcriptions may actually be local optima .",
    "therefore , both programs are set up to report the @xmath54 best solutions , where the user specifies the number of solutions desired .",
    "the program ensures that the same area of the search space is not re - explored by subsequent searches .",
    "this is done by defining a distance metric on transcriptions which counts the number of tones in one transcription that have to be changed in order to make it identical to the other transcription .",
    "that part of the search space within a distance of @xmath55 from any previously found solution is not explored again .",
    "the programs give up before finding @xmath54 solutions if 5 randomly generated transcriptions all fall within distance @xmath55 of previous solutions .",
    "now , consider the following randomly generated sequence of tones :     @xmath56 + 201 & 215 & 201 & 173 & 163 & 201 & 173 & @xmath57 & @xmath58 +    the annealing program was set the task of finding ten transcriptions of this tone sequence .",
    "the program was run only twice , and it reported the following solutions with evaluations less than or equal to 1 . both runnings of the program found the same solutions , and in the same order .",
    "( note that two transcriptions are taken to be the same if one or both begin with an initial upstep or downstep ; this has no effect on the phonetic interpretation ) . in the following displays",
    ", the predicted f@xmath0 values are given below each solution to facilitate comparison with the input sequence .",

    "interestingly , the third solution in both of the above executions was not found , though two new solutions were found .",

    "however , an analysis of the relationship between the kinds of solutions found , the two @xmath5 tables and the parameter values @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 has not been attempted .",
    "it is rather unsatisfying that the performance of the two programs is heavily dependent on the setting of several search parameters , and it seems to be a combinatorial optimisation problem in itself to find good parameter settings .",
    "my trial - and - error approach will not necessarily have found optimal parameter values , and so it would be premature to conclude from the performance comparison that annealing search is better than genetic search for the problem of tone transcription . a more thoroughgoing comparison of these two approaches to the problem needs to be undertaken .",
    "since the parameters are continuous variables , and since the evaluation function  which we could write as @xmath97is a smoothly continuous function in @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , it would be worthwhile to try other ( deterministic ) search methods for optimising @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , once a candidate tone transcription @xmath3 has been found .",

    "this paper began with a discussion of the problem of relating tone transcriptions to their physical counterparts , namely f@xmath0 traces .",
    "i showed that it is desirable for phonologists working on tone to use sequences of f@xmath0 values as their primary data , rather than impressionistic transcriptions which make ( usually implicit ) assumptions about f@xmath0 scaling .",
