    "even more than 30 years after the discovering of high energy pulsars , the theoretical reproduction of x - ray and @xmath1-ray emission from such pulsars is still a matter of debate .",
    "it is commonly agreed that there are two scenarios on modelling x - ray and @xmath1-ray creation : the outer gap ( og ) model ( e.g. , cheng , ho & ruderman 1986a , b , romani 1996 , cheng & zhang 1999 , hirotani & shibata 2001 ) and the polar cap ( pc ) model ( e.g. , harding 1981 , sturner & dermer 1994 , daugherty & harding 1996 , luo et al .",
    "2000 , zhang & harding 2000 ) .",
    "the fundamental difference between these two types of models is the location of the regions where particles are accelerated to relativistic energies and emit high energy photons . the early pc model ( harding 1981 ) assumed that the emission is produced just above the pc surface . in the present versions of pc model",
    "( e.g. daugherty & harding 1996 , harding & muslimov 1998 ) , it is proposed that the particle acceleration region may extend from the pc surface to several stellar radius above due to free charge flow and inertial frame dragging , so that wide double - peak x - ray and @xmath1-ray light curves can be reproduced , given the inclination angle is not large .",
    "in contrast , the og model ( cheng et al .",
    "1986a , chr ) presumed that the gaps can exist in the outer magnetosphere between the null charge surface and the light cylinder .",
    "later , chr model was developed to the single og models ( e.g. , chiang & romani 1994 , romani & yadigaroglu 1995 , cheng et al . 2000 ) , which claimed that the three dimension extents of ogs are constrained by the pair cascade processes , and a single og can produce wide double - peak high energy light curves .",
    "whereas theoretical considerations of more detailed physical processes for particle acceleration and photon emission are necessary , it is urgent and interesting to find new observational evidence for these models .",
    "psr b1937 + 21 , with the period of 1.56 ms , is the fastest millisecond pulsar ( msp ) known . at radio bands",
    ", it exhibits an interpulse emission that is roughly equal to the main pulse in intensity and separated from it by a phase of about @xmath0 .",
    "recently , the asca observations detected pulsed x - ray emission from this pulsar ( takahashi et al .",
    "only one nonthermal narrow pulse was observed , which is coincident with the radio interpulse in phase within the timing errors .",
    "the pulse width is about @xmath2 @xmath3s ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "besides the narrow pulse , the light curve reveals two additional wide gaussian - shaped bulges above the background level , with each phase interval being about 0.5 rotation period and each peak intensity @xmath5 of the nonthermal pulse peak .    where does the x - ray emission of the fastest msp come from , the pc or the og ?",
    "it has not been extensively studied as the other high energy pulsars such as the crab pulsar and vela .",
    "the previous work was done by luo et al ( 2000 ) , in which the pc model was modified for msps .",
    "they applied the theory to psr b1937 + 21 and suggested that the x - ray emission probably originates from the location of one stellar radius above the pc .    in this paper , efforts on modelling the observational data at radio and x - ray bands",
    "are made for both the pc and og models .",
    "the inclination angle between the rotation and magnetic axes is constrained in section 2 , which is necessary for the modelling .",
    "the modelling is carried out in section 3 .",
    "conclusions and discussions are placed in section 4 .",
    "the inclination angle ( @xmath6 ) between the rotation and magnetic axes is a necessary parameter for both the pc and og models to give various high energy emission beams .",
    "unfortunately , there is no agreement on the value of inclination angle of psr b1937 + 21 . in this section",
    "we reinvestigate the value of @xmath6 under the double - pole model , viz .",
    ", the radio interpulse and main pulse are considered to be from the opposite magnetic poles of a dipolar field , and the result is used in the calculation in section 3 .",
    "we assume that the radio emission beams from double poles are axisymmetric around the magnetic axis and have the same radius , namely , @xmath7 .",
    "according to the geometry model ( gil et al .",
    "1984 , lyne & manchester 1988 , lm88 ) one has @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is impact angle between the line of sight ( los ) and the magnetic axis , @xmath11 is the pulse width of the average profile , the subscripts ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' denote the main pulse and the interpulse , respectively .",
    "there are two simple geometrical relations between the inclination angles and the impact angles , namely , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "> from the above relations @xmath14 can be derived as @xmath15 , \\label{eq : bt1}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 in the following we neglect the subscript ` 1 ' , so that all the @xmath6 , @xmath10 and @xmath17 below are referred to the main pulse except for special declaration .    to figure out the value of @xmath18 , the profile at 1.5 ghz is chosen ( downloaded from epn ) for its high time resolution and low dispersion smearing ( kramer et al .",
    "the pulse widths are measured at the level of 10% of their peak intensities , which are @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the main pulse and the interpulse respectively .",
    "so that @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be calculated , as shown by the solid curve and the curve dotted by circles respectively in fig.1 .",
    "the @xmath21 curve approximates to a linear function of @xmath23 when @xmath24 , which is determined by the fact that the main pulse and interpulse are both narrow and differ only a little in pulse width .    for a dipolar field",
    ", the shape of the polar cap is found to change from a circle ( for @xmath25 ) to an ellipse of which the longitudinal radius is about 1.6 times of the latitudinal radius ( for @xmath26 , cheng et al .",
    "since the deviation from circular shape is not essentially significant , we simply regard the polar cap as a circle in this section . so that the opening angle ( between the magnetic axis and the tangent of the magnetic field line ) of the polar cap @xmath27 can be determined by the last open field line on the plane containing the rotation and magnetic axes ( @xmath28 plane ) .",
    "the radius @xmath27 is a function of the stellar radius r and the inclination angle @xmath6 , as shown by the dash curves in fig.1 for @xmath29 km and 10 km .",
    "we further assume that the boundary of the radio beam is defined by the last open field lines , then the beam radius should be greater than @xmath27 . according to this criteria",
    ", the inclination angle is constrained to be @xmath30 for @xmath31 km and @xmath32 for @xmath29 km . as the radii of neutron stars ( nss )",
    "are currently believed to be about 10 km , we accept that @xmath30",
    ".    can we determine the exact value of @xmath6 ?",
    "it is sure if the maximum rate of position angle @xmath33 is exactly known , where @xmath34 is the position angle and @xmath35 the pulse longitude .",
    "the maximum rate presents the second relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath10 , which reads @xmath36 combining with eq.s  [ eq : bt1 ] and  [ eq : ps ] , @xmath6 and @xmath10 can be solved for a given @xmath33 .",
    "although recent polarization observations present flat position angle sweeps ( thorsett & stinebring 1990 , stairs et al . 1999 ) , it can not be asserted that the real value of @xmath37 is small , because observations may give a less steep position angle gradient due to smearing of finite sampling time , to the frequency dispersion in pulse arrival time ( liu & wu , 1999 ) , and to the interstellar scattering ( gil 1985a ) .",
    "the @xmath38 curves derived from eq .  [ eq : ps ] for @xmath39 and 20 respectively are presented by the dotted curves in fig.1 .",
    "the intersections of @xmath38 and @xmath21 shows that a larger @xmath40 results in a larger @xmath6 and smaller @xmath10 , which means the los sweeps across the radio beam more closely to the beam center .",
    "one may find that when the real value of @xmath37 is large enough , @xmath6 would exceed @xmath41 ( for example , taken @xmath42 as proposed by gil ( 1985a ) , @xmath6 is @xmath43 ) and hence contradict against @xmath30 .",
    "however , if the radius is smaller , for example , @xmath29 km , this inconsistency would cancel .",
    "in fact , xu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that psr b1937 + 21 is probably a strange star ( ss ) with low mass and small radius .",
    "the detailed discussion is placed in section 4 .",
    "the range of @xmath6 presented above is different from the conventional consideration in double - pole model that @xmath6 should be close to 90@xmath44 ( stairs et al .",
    "alternatively , there is another kind of so - called single pole model to interpret the interpulse , which suggests that the interpulse emission comes from the same pole as the main pulse . in the single pole model proposed by gil ( 1985a ) for psr b1937 + 21 , @xmath6 only need to be 20@xmath44 .",
    "the single pole model predicts that the separation between the main pulse and interpulse may be close to 180@xmath44 and is frequency independent ( gil 1983 , 1985b ) , which is coincident with the observation of psr b1937 + 21 ( hankins & fowler 1986 ) .",
    "however , observations with high time resolution ( e.g. kramer et al .",
    "1998 , stairs et al . 1999 ) failed to find the emission components between the main pulse and interpulse , which was reported by stinebring et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and was suggested to be a strong support to the single pole model ( gil 1985a ) .",
    "therefore , in this paper the radio emission is considered to come from double poles .",
    "more confirmative estimations of @xmath45 are expected to determine @xmath6 and @xmath10 .",
    "in this section we calculate the x - ray beams in the frames of both the pc and og models to find out whether they are able to reproduce the observational facts .",
    "the facts used here are :    \\(1 ) at 1.4 ghz the separation between the peaks of interpulse and main pulse is @xmath46 ( measured from the profile presented by takahashi et al . ( 2001 ) ) ;    \\(2 ) at 1.5 ghz ( epn data ) the 10% widths of the main pulse and interpulse are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ;    \\(3 ) the nonthermal x - ray pulse is nearly coincident with the interpulse , the x - ray pulse width is about @xmath49 ( takahashi et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "luo et al . ( 2000 ) discussed the viability of pc models for high energy emission from msps .",
    "they found that the maximum lorenz factor of particles is limited by curvature radiation and not sensitive to the specific acceleration model , but the height where the lorenz factor achieves the maximum is model dependent , which may be between @xmath50 ( for the inner vacuum gap ) and above @xmath51 ( for the space - charge limited gap ) from pc surface for pulsar period @xmath52 ms and a surface magnetic field @xmath53 g. assuming a space - charge limited flow , the pair cascades can occur at the typical distance ( to the star center ) of @xmath54 , and high energy emission is radiated from this region .",
    "with respect to @xmath55 ms and @xmath56 g for psr b1937 + 21 , their analysis applies to this pulsar .",
    "since the radio emission is also radiated from the region near the pc , homocentric radio and x - ray beams are produced ( fig.2a ) .",
    "quantitatively , we assume the radio emission arises from the pc up to the distance @xmath57 , the x - rays may arise from the pc to a ( a ) relatively higher distance , e.g. , @xmath58 , or ( b ) lower distance , e.g. , @xmath59 . for simplicity",
    "we assume the emission regions are bounded by the last open field lines . in case ( a )",
    "the x - ray beams are wider than the radio beams , therefore , when the line of sight sweeps across the both radio beams ( to reproduce the main pulse and the interpulse ) it would sweep across the both x - ray beams either , and hence gives double x - ray pulse , which is inconsistent with the observation . in case",
    "( b ) the x - ray beams are narrower than the radio beams , and then , for a proper viewing angle ( between los and the rotation axis ) , only one x - ray beam could be observed . in this case , could the fact ( 3 ) be explained as well ?",
    "we analyze this issue by using the figure of the ( phase - viewing angle ) plane on which the emission beams are projected .    in fig.3 ,",
    "the horizon axis is pulse phase , the vertical axis is is the viewing angle @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the dotted curves represent the boundaries of x - ray beams , the solid curves are the boundaries of radio beams , and the pcs are shown by the dashed curves .",
    "retardation ( due to distinct emission heights ) and abberation effects ( due to emission sources co - rotating with the pulsar ) have been taken into account , both of which make the lower beam move towards the trailing edge of the higher beam . to obtain the figure ,",
    "a moderate inclination angle is taken , @xmath62 .",
    "although there is @xmath30 as discussed in section 2 , the angle should not be too small , or it would give too wide radio beams ( fig.1 ) , which must be emitted from unbelievably high distances near the light cylinder .    according to fig.3 , when @xmath63 the x - ray peak is coincident with the radio pulse centered on phase about 0.9 ; when @xmath64 it is coincident with the radio pulse on phase about 0.4 .",
    "however in both cases , the radio pulse associated with the x - ray pulse is the main pulse which is wider and more intense than the other one .",
    "however , we should point out that the above analysis is based on a simple assumption that the radio ( x - ray ) beams from both poles have the same width and the emission pattern in the beams is symmetrical about the magnetic axis . since the magnetosphere structure of pulsars and the detailed radio emission process are still unknown exactly , possibly significant deviation from the assumption",
    "can not be ruled out , and the validity of the pc model need to be considered further .",
    "we discuss such possibility in section 4 .      in the original og model chr",
    "suggested that a global current flow through the magnetosphere can result in large regions of ogs between the null charge surface and the light cylinder along the last open field lines . within the ogs particles with one kind of charge",
    "are accelerated outward from the star and give an outward emission beam , while those with the opposite charge are accelerated towards the star and give an inward beam .",
    "the high energy photons were proposed to be emitted from two ogs associated with the two poles so that double - peaked @xmath1-ray pulse profile can be reproduced , of which one peak corresponds to the outward beam from one og and the other peak to the inward beam from the opposite og .",
    "chr assumed that the ogs are active only near the @xmath28 plane .",
    "however , this assumption is merely valid for large inclination angles .",
    "the currently prevalent og models are the single og models ( e.g. chiang & romani 1992 , chiang & romani 1994 , cheng et al .",
    "generally the inward emission is not important in these models for the reason that the inward high energy photons can not pass freely through the inner magnetosphere due to magnetic pair production .",
    "the outward emission from the og associated with a single pole can produce a broad , irregularly - shaped emission beam which is particularly dense near the edge .",
    "the og regions can be supported along all the last open field lines , but the three dimension scales of ogs are limited by the pair production processes .    in the latest version of this type of model ( cheng et al . 2000 ) , the fraction size ( @xmath65 ) of the gap is @xmath66 , which can be estimated by the threshold of @xmath67 pair production , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the mean vertical extension perpendicular to the magnetic field , @xmath70 is the radius of light cylinder , @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the transverse extension of the gap , @xmath73 is the energy of the x - ray photons emitted from hot pcs , and @xmath74 is the characteristic photon energy emitted by the relativistic particles .",
    "the radial scale of pair production is limited to a range between @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath75 ( the subscript ` in ' means the inner boundary of the og ) is the distance of null charge surface , @xmath77 corresponds to the @xmath78 plane .    in the following",
    "our modelling is in the frame of single og model .",
    "only the outward emission beams from two ogs are considered , as illustrated by fig.2b . for psr b1937 + 21",
    ", we have a thin og with @xmath79 @xmath80 , so that the x - rays can be simply regarded as being radiated from the last open field lines unless @xmath81 is too small .",
    "the radial scale @xmath82 and the transverse scale @xmath81 are free parameters in calculating the x - ray beams .",
    "first we consider a general situation of the og scenario to test if the observation facts can be hopefully reproduced . from fig.2b",
    "one can see that provided the observer s viewing angle is not just @xmath83 , e.g. , @xmath84 , the los can sweep across both of the radio beams and only one x - ray beam . by assuming a group of reasonable values of parameters ( see the first line of table 1 ) , namely , the inclination angle , the stellar radius , the distance of radio emission , and the radial and transverse extensions of the ogs , the x - ray beams are calculated , which are demonstrated by the line - shadowed areas in fig.3 .",
    "retardation and abberation effects are also included .",
    "it shows clearly that the x - ray pulse could be associated with the radio interpulse ( which has a smaller width than the other one ) , and the narrow x - ray pulse width may be obtained if proper extension of the og is assumed",
    ".    then we model the observational data .",
    "the parameters listed in the second line of table 1 are found out to be able to reproduce the narrow x - ray pulse width , the radio pulse widths , and the coincidence between the x - ray pulse and the radio interpulse , which are in good agreement with the observational data . in order to simulate the observational profiles",
    ", we simply assume that the x - ray and radio pulses are gaussian shapes , and assume additionally wide , weak , hot x - ray emission from both of the pcs .",
    "the theoretical profiles are plotted in fig.4 , together with the observational profiles for comparison .",
    "it should be pointed out that modelling the x - ray pulse width is not sensitive to the value of @xmath82 but to @xmath81 , thereby the range of @xmath82 is relaxed and a reasonable value is chosen .",
    "other groups of values are also tried .",
    "it is found that for the moderate inclination angles @xmath85 the observational data can be reproduced with proper choice of the gap size ( @xmath86 in table 1 is approximately the maximum transverse scale ) .",
    "therefore , our calculation suggests that the nonthermal x - rays of psr b1937 + 21 may be emitted from the ogs .",
    "the discovery of pulsed x - ray emission from the msp psr b1937 + 21 and the phase alignment between the x - ray pulse and the radio interpulse provide valuable information on the emission mechanism . in this paper",
    "we investigate the possible origin of the x - rays from both the pc and og accelerators . in the frame of the prevailing og model ( e.g. cheng et al .",
    "2000 ) , the x - rays from outer gap accelerators could account for the main observational facts by assuming proper size of the ogs for an oblique rotator . in the frame of pc model , by assuming symmetric geometry for radio and x - ray emission , the x - rays from polar cap accelerators would produce an x - ray peak aligned with the main radio pulse in phase , which is contradictive against the observation .",
    "there is a slight inconsistency as shown in fig.4 , i.e. , in the og model , the calculated separation between the interpulse and main pulse is @xmath0 , @xmath87 greater than the observational value .",
    "this may be due to the retardation effect .",
    "the phase shift for different heights can be roughly estimated as @xmath88 .",
    "a difference of @xmath89 is enough to produce the phase shift of @xmath87 .    a moderate inclination angle @xmath90 is used in the modelling .",
    "but @xmath6 could be larger if the real gradient of position angle is steeper than the present observations as suggested in section 2 .",
    "could the og model be still valid for large value of @xmath6 ?    as shown in fig.1 , when @xmath91 it would result in a puzzling problem that the derived radio beam radius is considerably smaller than the pc radius , if @xmath31 km and a magnetic dipole are assumed .",
    "a much smaller stellar radius could cancel the problem , but this requires an ss scenario , because the smallest radius of nss is generally believed to be @xmath929 km while sss can have much smaller radius due to their different equations of state .",
    "in fact , according to the observational limits on the radius and mass derived from the pulse width and @xmath40 , xu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that psr b1937 + 21 is probably a strange star with much low mass , small radius and weak magnetic moment . if psr b1937 + 21 is an ss with small radius , for example , @xmath93 km , a group of parameters is found out to be able to model the observational data by og model , which is listed in the third line in table 1 .",
    "then we turn to the pc model .",
    "when the emission geometry is not symmetrical , the pc model could be able to explain the observation as well .",
    "the possible asymmetry is discussed for the radio and the x - ray emission , respectively .",
    "\\(1 ) it has been assumed that the radio emission pattern from the two poles is the same in our modelling ; the different behaviors of the main pulse and the interpulse are thus geometrical origin .",
    "however , their difference may be caused intrinsically since the mechanism for the radio emission is still poorly understood .",
    "for example , a possible reason may be that the pulsar has a non - dipolar magnetic field , thus the distribution of emission intensity in the radio beams may be different from each other , which could lead to that for one beam only part of it is observed while for the other a larger part or the whole is observed .",
    "\\(2 ) when psr b1937 + 21 is an ns or an ss with crust and its inclination angle is near @xmath83 , the x - ray emission pattern may be significantly asymmetric about the magnetic axis . in this case",
    ", the space charge is negative on the side toward the rotation axis ( where @xmath94 , hereafter side i ) and positive on the side away from the axis ( where @xmath95 , hereafter side ii ) . on side",
    "ii the ions can be pulled away from the surface by strong electric field if the binding energy is small enough .",
    "therefore , the half beam from side ii could be much less luminous than that from side i due to the much smaller lorentz factors of the ions , and thus may be too weak to be observed .",
    "notice that , if side i is above the equator on one pole , it should be below the equator on the other pole .",
    "therefore , only single x - ray peak is observed which may coincide with the radio interpulse .    in recent years , it is suggested that pulsars may be bare strange stars ( bsss ) ( e.g. , xu 2002 and references therein ) . if psr b1937 + 21 is also a bss , the positive charge on side ii is carried by positrons but not ions , then the emission pattern on both sides should be the same , and each beam may be symmetric around the magnetic axis . in this case , when symmetrical geometry is assumed for the radio emission , pc model could not account for the observational facts , otherwise , pc model may still be valid .    in general , further research on the pulsar s magnetosphere structure and emission mechanisms will be helpful to understand the origin of its x - rays for psr b1937 + 21 .",
    "we are expecting that future polarization observations could provide more confirmative value of @xmath40 , which is meaningful not only for constraining whether this pulsar is an ns or an ss but also for a better understanding of its x - ray emission .",
