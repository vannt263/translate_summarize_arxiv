    "in recent years the superconductor - ferromagnet ( s / f ) hybrid structures attract a steadily growing interest . the actual progress in the preparation of s",
    "/ f / s junctions permits to observe the transition from normal 0-junction to the so - called @xmath0-junction with the change of the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer @xcite .",
    "such a behavior has been predicted in @xcite  and it is related to the oscillations of a superconducting order parameter in the ferromagnetic layer .",
    "another manifestation of the spin - dependent transport in s / f hybrid structures is the dependence of the critical temperature of metallic f / s / f sandwiches on the mutual orientation of ferromagnetic moments of the outer layers . on the basis of usadel equations , applicable in the dirty limit",
    ", it has been demonstrated in @xcite , that the antiparallel orientation of the ferromagnetic moments is more favorable for superconductivity , i.e. it corresponds to the higher superconducting transition temperature and to the larger amplitude of the superconducting order parameter . recently",
    "this effect has been observed on experiment @xcite .",
    "note also that for the first time the coupling between ferromagnets through a superconducting layer has been treated theoretically in @xcite for the case of ferromagnetic insulators and observed on experiment in @xcite .    at the same time in @xcite , a microscopic multiterminal model for s - f hybrid structure at @xmath1 has been proposed ,  where the ferromagnet was described by different density of states for opposite orientations of the magnetic moment .",
    "then , it has been deduced that the superconducting gap is less influenced by the ferromagnetism for the case of parallel orientation of the f electrodes .",
    "hence at @xmath2 the parallel orientation of the ferromagnetic moments appears more favorable for superconductivity .    in the present work",
    "we analyze the properties of the microscopic model system comprising three coupled atomic - scale layers : one superconducting layer in between of two ferromagnetic layers , which can have parallel or antiparallel orientation of the magnetic moments .",
    "this model may be relevant for the description of layered superconductors like rusr@xmath3gdcu@xmath4 , where superconducting and magnetic layers alternate @xcite as well as artificial s / f structures obtained by molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "such a model can be solved exactly and so we may verify that the results for the critical temperature for a diffusive regime of electrons motion , obtained in @xcite , are also qualitatively applicable for a clean atomic layered system .",
    "we demonstrate that in all cases the antiparallel alignment of ferromagnetic moments corresponds to the higher transition temperature to the superconducting state .",
    "however at low temperature the situation may be different and as it follows from our analysis , the superconducting gap for parallel alignments of ferromagnetic moments increases faster with the decrease of the temperature comparing with the antiparallel alignment . at some temperature @xmath5 the gaps for parallel and antiparallel alignment coincides and at @xmath6",
    "the gap is higher for parallel alignment .",
    "so at @xmath1 the parallel alignment is more favorable for superconductivity while near @xmath7 the situation is inverse .",
    "this result is in accordance with @xcite , where the superconducting gap have been calculated at @xmath1 in the framework of quite different model of bulk superconductor in the contact with small ferromagnetic electrodes .",
    "adopting the model of @xcite , we consider a three layers system with one superconducting layer between two ferromagnetic layers , see fig .",
    "it is supposed that the coupling between layers is realized via the transfer integral @xmath8 , which is relatively small ( @xmath9 , so the superconductivity can coexist with ferromagnetism in the adjacent layers . introducing the notations @xmath10 and @xmath11 for electrons creation operators in f layers and @xmath12 in s layer",

    "note that the electrons spectra in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) are calculated from the fermi energy .",
    "the superconducting order parameter satisfies the usual self - consistency equation @xmath22 where , @xmath23 is the cooper pairing constant which is assumed to be non zero in s layers only . introducing in the usual way @xcite thegreen functions @xmath24 and writing the corresponding equations for the green functions , we finally obtain the following exact expressions for the green functions in s layer : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , \\\\ b & = & i\\omega -\\xi -t^{2}\\left [ \\frac{1}{i\\omega -\\xi _ { \\downarrow } ^{\\varphi } } + \\frac{1}{i\\omega -\\xi _ { \\downarrow } ^{\\eta } } \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the self - consistency equation for superconducting order parameter is now written as @xmath27 to calculate the critical temperature of the superconducting transition it is sufficient to know the anomalous green function @xmath28 in the linear approximation on @xmath29 then it is convenient to write the linearized self - consistency equation for @xmath7 in the following form @xcite @xmath30 ,   \\label{eq for tc}\\ ] ] where we have defined a reduced function @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the bare mean - field critical temperature of the central s layer in the absence of the proximity effect ( i.e. for @xmath33 .    in the case",

    "firstly we consider the situation when the electron dispersion spectra in the ferromagnet  differs only by the exchange field @xmath38 from the electron spectrum in s layer i.e. @xmath39 and @xmath40    performing in ( [ eq for tc ] ) the integration over energy @xmath41 and summation over matsubara s frequencies @xmath42 , we finally obtain @xmath43 \\right\\ } ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath44 , \\ ] ] where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is the superconducting transition temperature for parallel ( antiparallel ) orientation of the f - layers magnetic moments and we define the function @xmath47 through the digamma function @xmath48 as ( @xmath49 is euler constant ) @xmath50 \\right\\ } .\\ ] ] using ( [ eq for ta and tp ] ) we can determine the relative variation of critical temperature @xmath51 in the two following limits :    * i ) * in the limit *  * @xmath52 up to the fourth order over @xmath8 we have : @xmath53 + \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{\\left ( 2\\pi t_{c0}\\right ) ^{6}}\\left [ \\left ( \\frac{1085}{16}% \\zeta ( 3)\\zeta ( 5)-\\frac{889}{8}\\zeta ( 7)\\right ) t^{4}h^{2}-\\frac{127}{16}% \\zeta ( 7)t^{2}h^{4}\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath54 the last result , the difference @xmath55 was already found for s / f multilayer in @xcite ( after correcting a sign mistake ) .",
    "* ii ) * in the limit *  * @xmath56 and for @xmath57 we obtain : @xmath58 , \\ ] ] @xmath59 , \\ ] ] @xmath60 also the difference of the critical temperatures @xmath61 coincides with that of the s / f multilayer @xcite .",
    "we see that in all cases the difference between critical temperatures for parallel and antiparallel alignment is proportional to @xmath62 , while the decrease of the critical temperature itself is proportional to @xmath63 this fact demonstrates that the spin - orientation dependence of @xmath7 is related with  a rather subtle interference effect between electrons coming from ferromagnetic layers .",
    "now we consider the case of a ferromagnetic half - metal , which we may model in ( [ sol ] ) by @xmath64 and @xmath65that corresponds to a zero density of sates for the electrons with spin orientation along magnetic moment in ferromagnetic layers .",
    "note that the limit @xmath66is equivalent to take the transfer integral for electrons with spin up orientation equal to zero .",
    "this may be simply demonstrated  from the initial equations for the green functions@xmath67 performing integration over @xmath41 and summation over matsubara frequencies in the self - consistency equation , we can deduce the relative temperature variation @xmath68 at the order up to @xmath62 , in terms of the dimensionless field @xmath69@xmath70 \\right\\ }   \\frac{t^{4}}{\\pi ^{4}t_{c0}^{4}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath71 \\frac{t^{4}}{\\pi ^{4}t_{c0}^{4 } } ,   \\label{tc semimetal}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath47 was defined before and the function @xmath72 is @xmath73 .\\ ] ] in the limiting case @xmath74which corresponds to the situation @xmath75or simply @xmath76 we have @xmath77 \\frac{t^{2}}{\\pi ^{2}t_{c0}^{2}}+\\left\\ { \\frac{31}{64}\\zeta ( 5)-\\frac{3}{2}\\left ( \\frac{7}{8}% \\zeta ( 3)\\right ) ^{2}\\right\\ } \\frac{t^{4}}{\\pi ^{4}t_{c0}^{4}},\\ ] ] and the critical temperature difference is @xmath78 in the opposite limit @xmath79 we find @xmath80 and @xmath81 then we may conclude that in all cases the critical temperature is higher for the antiparallel alignment of the ferromagnetic moments .",
    "in this section we demonstrate that the proximity effect at low temperature is very special and that the superconducting gap at @xmath2 for half - metal and for usual ferromagnet with small exchange field , is higher for parallel orientation in accordance with @xcite .",
    "firstly we consider the model of a half - metal with @xmath82 and @xmath83 so the self consistency equations for parallel and antiparallel orientations may be written as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the electron density of state .    in the limit of weak interlayer coupling @xmath86 and at @xmath2 we obtain the following expression for the superconducting gap for parallel orientation @xmath87@xmath88 d\\theta , \\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the gap of an isolated s layer .",
    "performing expansion over @xmath90 it may be demonstrated that at all order over @xmath91the corrections to @xmath87 disappear , and @xmath92 .",
    "so the proximity effect for the case of half - metal vanishes",
    ". it may be understood as an impossibility of cooper pair destruction .",
    "indeed at @xmath1 , the disappearance of the cooper pair in s layer means that two electrons with opposite spins must leave it . due to the insulating character of neighboring f layer for some one spin orientation it becomes impossible and so",
    ", the cooper pair is not destroyed at all .    on the other hand , for the antiparallel alignment",
    "this argument does not works and  the proximity effect leads to a decrease of the gap @xmath93@xmath94 therefore the superconducting gap variation is @xmath95 as the superconducting transition temperature is higher for the ap case , it means that above some temperature @xmath96the gap for parallel orientation becomes smaller than that for antiparallel orientation .    to find this temperature @xmath97 in the limit @xmath86 we perform an expansion over @xmath8 in the self - consistency equations for @xmath98 after integration over energy @xmath41 we have the following equation for the ratio @xmath99@xmath100[(2k+1)^{2}+x^{2}]^{1/2}}{% ( 2k+1)[(2k+1)^{2}+x^{2}]^{3/2}[(2k+1)+\\sqrt{(2k+1)^{2}+x^{2}}]^{4}}=0,\\ ] ] from what we find @xmath101 @xmath102 .",
    "taking into account that in the limit @xmath86 the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap in the first approximation is the same as that for an isolated s layer @xmath103 , we directly find the temperature of gap inversion @xmath104    similar calculations can be performed for the standard ferromagnetic case with @xmath39 and @xmath64 in the limit @xmath105 in the result we obtain the following equation for the ratio @xmath99@xmath106^{3/2}[(2k+1)+\\sqrt{(2k+1)^{2}+x^{2}}]^{6}}% + \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ \\left .",
    "\\frac{+38(2k+1)^{4}-11(2k+1)^{2}x^{2}-x^{4}}{% ( 2k+1)^{3}[(2k+1)^{2}+x^{2}][(2k+1)+\\sqrt{(2k+1)^{2}+x^{2}}]^{6}}\\right\\ } = 0,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which gives @xmath107 , and the temperature @xmath96 of the gap inversion is @xmath108",
    "in the present work we have demonstrated that , in the framework of the considered microscopic model , in all cases the superconducting transition temperature is higher for antiparallel orientation of the ferromagnetic moments . this is consistent with the predictions made in @xcite , on the basis of the diffusive dirty limit model and recent experimental results @xcite .",
    "we may consider this result as a quite general one and model independent . on the other hand",
    "the superconducting gap at low temperature for the case of half - metal and for usual ferromagnet with small exchange field occurs to be larger for parallel orientation .",
    "this is in opposite with the diffusive model prediction @xcite , but in accordance with the @xmath1 result  @xcite obtained in the framework of the multiterminal model for s - f hybrid structures .",
    "it may be interesting to calculate the superconducting critical temperature in the model @xcite to compare with our predictions .",
    "finally we conclude that the spin - orientation dependence of the superconductivity in f / s / f atomic layers structure may be quite different at high and low temperature regimes .",
    "note also that the condition of small interlayer coupling @xmath86 , may be crucial for the conclusion that there is a gap inversion for parallel and antiparallel orientation with temperature decrease .",
    "indeed , it has been demonstrated in @xcite , that the strength of interlayer coupling may qualitatively change the critical temperature dependence via the exchange field .",
    "note also , that strictly speaking , the superconductivity is impossible in atomic 2d system .",
    "however , our results must be qualitatively applicable for systems consisting of several consecutive s and f layers , as well as for s / f multilayered systems , where the fluctuations are strongly suppressed ."
