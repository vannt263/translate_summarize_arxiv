    "one attosecond ( 10@xmath0 ) is roughly the time it takes for light to travel through atomic distances .",
    "this fact makes high - frequency pulses of attosecond duration a very powerful tool for resolving or even controlling dynamic processes occurring at the atomic scale @xcite . indeed , in the past few years",
    ", such pulses have caused a breakthrough in metrology , with applications as diverse as resolving the motion of bound electrons @xcite , exciting inner - shell electrons @xcite , inducing vibrational wavepackets in molecules @xcite , or controlling electron emission @xcite .",
    "attosecond pulses have been predicted theoretically in the mid-1990s @xcite and have become experimentally feasible a few years later @xcite .",
    "they are a direct consequence of the fact that high - order harmonics , generated by the interaction of a strong laser field ( intensities of the order of @xmath1 ) with a gaseous sample , are almost phase locked @xcite .",
    "hence , by superposing sets of high harmonics , it is possible to produce attosecond pulses .",
    "specifically , there exist two main scenarios : either one obtains an attosecond - pulse train , by employing long input pulses @xcite , or isolated attosecond pulses , from few - cycle driving fields @xcite .",
    "both situations have been widely exploited in the literature , and sometimes the attosecond pulses appear in combination with additional driving fields .",
    "for instance , recently , an attosecond - pulse train superposed to a strong , infrared , linearly polarized field has been employed to control high - harmonic generation ( hhg ) @xcite and above - threshold ionization ( ati ) @xcite .",
    "such a train exhibited a time - delay @xmath2 with respect to the infra - red field . by varying this delay , one could influence several features , such as the intensities , resolutions , and maximal energies in the high - harmonic or photoelectron spectra .",
    "this scheme has been proposed theoretically @xcite and realized experimentally @xcite , and the key idea behind it is to provide an additional pathway , which can be controlled , for an electronic wave packet to be released in the continuum .",
    "this can be understood in view of the physical mechanisms behind both phenomena . at a time",
    "@xmath3 an electron is freed by tunneling or multiphoton ionization.@xmath4subsequently , it propagates in the continuum , gaining energy from the field , and it is driven back towards its parent ion , to which it returns at a time @xmath5 . if the electron recombines or rescatters , there is either emission of high - frequency radiation ( i.e. , hhg ) , or of high - energy photoelectrons ( i.e. , high - order ati ) @xcite . for low - order ati peaks , the electron reaches the detector without rescattering .",
    "an attosecond pulse train allows the electron to reach the continuum by absorbing high - energy photons and being able to overcome the ionization potential .",
    "additionally , since they are of very short duration , the attosecond pulses provide a tool to control the instant at which the electron is being ejected .",
    "this has direct consequences in the momentum it acquires from the field when it is released @xcite , and also a strong influence on the kinetic energy the electron has upon return @xcite .",
    "therefore , it also affects the spectra .",
    "the results in @xcite and @xcite have been obtained from the numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation , and the attosecond - pulse train has been modeled by the superposition of five harmonics ( @xmath6 to @xmath7 ) .",
    "these are realistic assumptions , and well within the available experimental data . however , in order to interpret the results obtained , the attosecond - pulse train has been approximated by a monochromatic wave of frequency @xmath8 which is the central frequency of the group of harmonics in question , and a classical model for an electron ejected by such a wave and propagating in a strong , low - frequency field was constructed .",
    "these simplifications have enormously facilitated the understanding of the ionization mechanisms , and , specifically , have shown how to manipulate ionization by varying the time delay @xmath9    in a previous publication , we have also investigated the ati and hhg spectra from an atom irradiated by a time - delayed attosecond - pulse train superposed to a near - infrared laser field @xcite . specifically , we have considered the transition amplitudes for both phenomena within the strong - field approximation , and took the attosecond pulse train to be a sum of dirac - delta functions in the time domain .",
    "these assumptions have allowed an almost entirely analytical treatment , which has been vital for a clear understanding of the problem .",
    "indeed , we were able to investigate the influence of the attosecond pulses on the spectra in far more detail than in @xcite , and to interpret the results obtained in terms of quantum interference effects .    to a very large extent ,",
    "our results , as well as their physical interpretation , agree with those in @xcite .",
    "in fact , we have obtained , for very specific time delays , enhancements of more than one order of magnitude in the harmonic spectra similar to those reported in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as the time delay increases , the enhancements move gradually from the high - order harmonics towards lower frequencies , until they only affect the low - plateau region .",
    "finally , for ati , we have observed an identical behavior of the yield with the time delay as in @xcite , namely that it extends towards higher energies if @xmath10 , and that it decays most quickly , as the frequency increases , for @xmath11 .    there",
    "exist , however , a few discrepancies , especially for hhg , between our results and those in @xcite . first , the above - mentioned features occur for different phases @xmath12 .",
    "second , the explanations for such features are slightly different . in @xcite , we related the enhancements in the spectra to a particular pair of orbits , for which the excursion times @xmath13 of the electron in the continuum were very short",
    ". therefore , the spreading of the electronic wave packet in the continuum would be very reduced .",
    "hence , the overlap of this wave packet , upon return , with the bound state it left , would be considerable , leading to very prominent harmonics .",
    "we have shown that the maximal kinetic energy the electron may have upon return , for this pair of orbits , was very much dependent on the delay between the infra - red field and attosecond - pulse train , going from @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the ponderomotive energy , to vanishingly small values . in the former case , this leads to strong harmonics throughout , whereas the latter case causes enhancements only in low - energy regions of the spectra .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , the modifications in the spectra have been attributed to the selection of specific electron trajectories , which are present in case it is released by a high - frequency wave , and , subsequently , propagates in a strong infra - red field . in comparison to the case in which the electron is released only by the infrared field , there is a splitting in the electron orbits , into the so - called `` downhill '' and `` uphill '' trajectories , with respect to the effective potential barrier @xmath16 at the electron start time @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the electric field and the atomic binding potential , respectively .",
    "the former and the latter case relate to the situation for which the electron velocity , at @xmath20 , has the opposite or the same direction of the field , respectively .",
    "if the time delays are appropriately chosen , one may enhance ionization , and thus the hhg spectra , for a particular set of orbits , or for none .",
    "probably , such discrepancies are rooted on the fact that the attosecond pulse train has been modeled in different ways .",
    "while in @xcite it has been approximated by a monochromatic wave , in @xcite we considered a dirac - delta comb . in this context , one should keep in mind that a realistic attosecond - pulse train possesses a broad frequency range .",
    "therefore , a monochromatic wave is as much as an approximation as a dirac - delta comb .",
    "the main difference lies in the number of harmonics composing the train : the former should work better if this number is small ( such as in @xcite ) , and the latter if it is large .    in this",
    "proceeding , we present a detailed discussion of the two limits which one may adopt , when modeling the attosecond pulse train .",
    "we put a particular emphasis on the consequences of taking the attosecond pulse train to be a monochromatic wave , within the strong - field approximation , for high - order harmonic generation . in order to make an assessment of the similarities and differences from the dirac delta comb employed in our previous work @xcite , we will also briefly recall such results .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "the main features in the spectra , such as their overall intensities , the plateau shapes and cutoff energies , are determined by the orbits @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , the contributions from such orbits are at least one order of magnitude larger than those from @xmath116 or @xmath115 .",
    "this is in particular true for the case @xmath97 , due to the shorter excursion times .",
    "apart from that , they coalesce at a much larger energy than the other sets .",
    "this means that , classically , the maximal energy for which the electron returns to its parent ion along @xmath79 , and consequently the cutoff , is larger than for the longer orbits . in the figure",
    ", we also notice that the hump in the low - plateau region , for @xmath144 can be traced back to the fact that the electron excursion time in the continuum , for the set @xmath79 is extremely short in this case ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "the other pairs of orbits mainly contribute to the substructure in the spectra .",
    "another noteworthy feature is that , regardless of the sign of @xmath145 , the cutoff energies are the same for all sets of orbits , in agreement with the previous discussion .     or @xmath143 in eq .",
    "( [ tret1 ] ) , respectively . for comparison",
    "the overall contributions are displayed as the solid black lines in the figure .",
    "the numbers on the upper edge of the figure give the kinetic energy of the electron upon return , in units of the ponderomotive energy @xmath15.,width=340 ]    another scenario , presented in fig . 7 for comparison ,",
    "is observed if the attosecond - pulse train is taken to be a dirac - delta comb . in this case , the dominant set of orbits , and , consequently , the shape of the spectra , are highly dependent on the time delay @xmath128 .",
    "for instance , if the time delay is vanishing [ fig .",
    "7.(a ) ] , the spectrum is dominated by the orbits @xmath79 .",
    "this is due to the fact that they coalesce at the energy @xmath146 , which is at a relatively high harmonic order .",
    "furthermore , since the electron excursion times are very short , the harmonics are quite prominent . for @xmath147 [ fig .",
    "7.(b ) ] , there is now a double plateau , with two consecutive intensity drops at @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "these are the energies for which the orbits @xmath79 and @xmath116 coalesce , respectively . specifically in the upper half of the plateau",
    ", there was a drop in one order of magnitude , as compared to fig .",
    "this is due to the larger excursion times , and , consequently , wave - packet spreading , for @xmath116 . if the delay increases further [ fig .",
    "7.(c ) ] , the contributions from @xmath79 only cause a shoulder in the spectrum , due to the fact that they now coalesce at @xmath150 , and the plateau , extending until @xmath151 , is determined by the orbits @xmath116 .",
    "the latter orbits dominate the spectra even more for @xmath152 [ fig .",
    "7.(d ) ] , since the cutoff energy for @xmath79 is now vanishingly small .",
    "this effect is very similar to that observed in @xcite , even though it occurs for completely different delays .    , @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 between the attosecond - pulse train and the low - frequency driving wave ( figs .",
    "[ hhgfig3](a ) ,  [ hhgfig3].(b ) ,  [ hhgfig3].(c ) and  [ hhgfig3].(d ) , respectively ) . in the figure",
    ", we only show the harmonic orders for which @xmath156 .",
    "the contributions from specific pairs of orbits are depicted in the same colors as those employed in fig .",
    "4 , for depicting each corresponding pair . for comparison ,",
    "the spectra computed with the ten shortest orbits and with orbit 3 to 10 are given as the thick lines in the figure .",
    "the numbers on the upper edges of the figure give the approximate kinetic energy of the electron upon return , in units of the ponderomotive energy @xmath15.,width=377 ]",
    "the outcome of this work supports the results in @xcite in several ways . in general",
    ", it also shows that , by changing the initial conditions with which an electron is ejected in the continuum , one may manipulate several features in the spectra , such as the high - harmonic intensities , or cutoff .",
    "furthermore , by considering the electron to be released in the continuum by a monochromatic wave , we have obtained a splitting of the electron start times very similar to that reported in @xcite , within the context of the strong - field approximation , in the so - called uphill and downhill trajectories .",
    "we have also observed enhancements in the low - plateau region , and higher overall intensities for the contributions from the downhill trajectories .",
    "this indicates a good perspective for harmonic control , by selecting either the downhill or uphill trajectories with , for instance , an adequate delay between the infrared field and the attosecond - pulse train .",
    "we have also obtained very detailed information about the contributions of specific pairs of orbits to the spectra . in the monochromatic limit ,",
    "the shortest pair of trajectories , denoted @xmath79 is completely dominant , determining the shape of the plateau , the cutoff energy and the overall intensity in the spectra .",
    "this is due to the fact that the maximal classical energy for this pair , and thus the cutoff , is always at a higher harmonic order than for the longer pairs of trajectories .",
    "in contrast , in case one considers a sum of dirac - delta functions , the dominance of this pair will depend very much on the time delay between the infra - red field and the attosecond pulses .",
    "this is due to the fact that the maximal energy an electron returning along these orbits is not always at a higher harmonic frequency than for the longer pairs .",
    "for instance , if for @xmath157 the orbits ( 1,2 ) coalesce at the end of the plateau , and thus overshadow the remaining contributions , for @xmath158 and @xmath159 this energy lies at the low - energy part of the plateau , or near the ionization potential , respectively .",
    "hence , the orbits ( 3,4 ) will also play an important role in the spectra .    a feature in common for both the monochromatic and the dirac - delta limits",
    "is that the excursion time @xmath13 of the electron in the continuum is a very important parameter , and considerably influences the shape of the plateau and harmonic intensities .",
    "this is not surprising , since , now , for all sets of orbits , the electron is reaching the continuum with a roughly equal , and large , probability .",
    "hence , the differences in the yield will be mainly determined by the overlap between the returning electronic wave packet and the bound state with which it recombines .",
    "the shorter the orbit along which the electron is returning is , the larger this overlap will be .",
    "in contrast , if the electron is released by tunneling ionization , the probability with which it is ejected will depend much more critically on the instantaneous potential barrier , and also influence the yield .",
    "moreover , it is remarkable that both asymptotic limits exhibit features in common with those obtained in @xcite within a more realistic model for the attosecond pulses .",
    "the monochromatic limit , for instance , allows one to identify the downhill and uphill trajectories , and to analyze their consequences in the spectra . approximating the attosecond pulse train by a sum of dirac delta functions , on the other hand , sheds light on several features reported in @xcite , such as a double plateau , or changes of more than one order of magnitude in the harmonic spectra .",
    "however , only in delta - dirac case there is a decrease in the energy of the enhanced harmonics , with increasing time delays @xmath128 .",
    "there exist , however , aspects of @xcite that we have not addressed .",
    "we have not , for instance , investigated the differences in the high - harmonic resolution , due to a particular trajectory choice . indeed , in order to do so , it would have been necessary to extend the start times to several cycles of the laser field . instead ,",
    "we have restricted them only to the first half cycle , in order to have a closer look at quantum interference effects .",
    "furthermore , the uniform approximation employed in this work requires that we deal with pairs of trajectories ( for details see @xcite ) , and such effects are expected to be related to single trajectories in a pair @xcite .",
    "these issues were not the main objective of this work , and are open for further studies .",
