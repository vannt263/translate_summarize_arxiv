    "the concept of curve crossing has many applications in the study of atomic collisions @xcite , excitations of atoms and molecules by nonstationary fields @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite , and solid state physics @xcite .",
    "typical curve crossing problems are generally divided into two classes , @xmath0-dependent and @xmath1-dependent ones .",
    "the description of inelastic collisions , for example , involves crossings of coordinate - dependent potentials , and can therefore be treated as an @xmath0-dependent problem , described by a set of coupled second - order stationary schrdinger equations . by the use of a common - trajectory approximation @xcite",
    ", @xmath0-dependent problems can be reduced to @xmath1-dependent ones .",
    "the latter class also naturally appears in the description of transitions due to non - stationary fields .",
    "typical @xmath1-dependent problems involve the crossing of time - varying potentials , and their description requires a set of coupled first - order non - stationary schrdinger equations .",
    "curve crossing problems are usually solved by using semiclassical approximations .",
    "two - state crossing is described by the landau - zener ( lz ) formula @xcite ( or one of its various modifications @xcite ) , while multistate crossing is treated as a sequence of independent two - state crossings .",
    "although semiclassical approaches are satisfactory for many applications ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , they fail to describe certain effects found recently in experiments , numerical calculations , and analytically - soluble potential models @xcite .",
    "the lz formula forms an exact solution of the problem involving the crossing of two linear potentials infinitely diverging on both asymptotes .",
    "it gives good results even when local perturbations in the vicinity of the crossing are taken into account @xcite .",
    "however , if the potentials retain a finite potential gap on an asymptote @xcite , have singularities @xcite , or are truncated @xcite , the transition probabilities deviate essentially from the lz formula .",
    "some interesting effects appear also in state crossing involving bose - einstein condensates , described by the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equations ( see @xcite ) , instead of the linear schrdinger equations .",
    "the treatment of multistate curve crossing as a sequence of independent two - state crossings , commonly used in semiclassical approaches , fails to describe `` counterintuitive '' transitions ( see @xcite ) , in which the second crossing precedes the first one . in the case of a @xmath1-dependent linear grid ( see @xcite ) consisting of two sets of mutually parallel potentials ( see fig .  [ figpot ] ) , counterintuitive transitions are exactly forbidden if the problem is defined on the infinite time interval ( @xmath2 ) , as has been shown in ref .  @xcite .",
    "however , the potentials in the grid infinitely diverge on both asymptotes , which is unphysical .",
    "we consider here a truncated linear grid , defined on a finite time interval @xmath3 .",
    "such a truncation is relevant for application to transitions in time - dependent fields ( e.g. , single electronics @xcite ) , since the field variation is actually finite .",
    "the problem is studied here with the help of the `` quasidegeneracy '' approximation , introduced in @xcite for the case when one of the sets consists of only one potential .",
    "this approximation treats a non - degenerate system with small potential gaps as a perturbed degenerate system ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a special form of the quasidegeneracy approximation was used also in ref .",
    "this form is applicable to a linear grid consisting of two potentials in each set , with equal couplings between all states belonging to different sets , while only one of the sets is quasidegenerate .",
    "the method of ref .",
    "@xcite is actually a simplified form of the method of ref .",
    ". a linear grid in which one set of parallel potentials is exactly degenerate was considered also in ref.@xcite , by using a method different from the quasidegeneracy approximation .",
    "the quasidegeneracy approximation is generalized here to the case of a truncated linear grid with arbitrary number of potentials in both sets . in sec .",
    "[ sectran ] we introduce a `` decoupling '' transformation , which approximately transforms the problem to a set of parallel two - state crossings .",
    "the transition amplitudes are calculated in sec .",
    "[ secamp ] , and applicability criteria are presented in sec .",

    "a few preliminary results of this work have been presented in @xcite .",
    "let us consider two sets of mutually parallel linear potentials .",
    "this problem can be easily reduced by a gauge transformation to the case of a set of horizontal potentials @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) crossed by a set of slanted parallel linear potentials @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) ( see fig .  [ figpot ] ) .",
    "the interactions between the states within each set of parallel potentials can be eliminated by a unitary transformation .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we can describe the problem by the following system of coupled equations for the expansion coefficients @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( using a system of units in which @xmath10 ) .",
    "the only non - vanishing coupling coefficients @xmath11 involve pairs of crossed potentials .",
    "the problem is defined here on the finite time - interval @xmath12 .",
    "the special case of @xmath13 has been considered in @xcite , by using a quasidegeneracy approximation . in order to generalize this approximation ,",
    "let us perform a singular value decomposition ( svd ) for the coupling matrix @xmath11 , of the form @xmath14 this decomposition is well known in the theory of spline approximations ( see , e. g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the two matrices with elements @xmath15 and @xmath16 are unitary , and their rows are the eigenvectors of the quadratic matrices formed by products of the @xmath11 and their hermitian conjugates : @xmath17 using the matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath18 leads to a new system of coupled equations @xmath19 in which @xmath20 given a matrix @xmath11 , its svd is not unique , and may be chosen in such a way that its singular values @xmath21 are real and non - negative , and the non - diagonal potential elements @xmath22 and @xmath23 vanish when @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "when both parallel sets of potentials are degenerate , the matrices @xmath26 and @xmath27 are diagonal , and the system ( [ trde ] ) describes a set of @xmath28 independent pairs of crossing potentials , @xmath29 separate horizontal potentials ( not coupled to other channels ) , and @xmath30 separate slanted potentials . since the transformation ( [ ab ] ) partially eliminates the coupling between the states , hereafter it is called the  decoupling transformation  .",
    "the channels described by coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 will be called the `` decoupled channels '' .    in the non - degenerate case",
    "the non - diagonal elements of @xmath33 and @xmath23 lead to transitions between the decoupled channels .",
    "however , the magnitudes of these non - diagonal elements are bounded by the inequalities @xmath34 where the bandwidths of the potential sets are defined as @xmath35 therefore , these transitions are negligible if the bandwidths of the two potential sets are small enough .",

    "given an arbitrary matrix @xmath11 , the transformation matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 can not be generally expressed in an analytical form .",
    "nevertheless , analytical expressions can be obtained in the specific case of a separable matrix @xmath40 . in this case ,",
    "one of the rows ( the first , for definiteness ) has the form @xmath41 and the other rows are orthogonal to the first one .",
    "the singular values can then be written as @xmath42 horizontal , and @xmath43 slanted , separate potentials .    in the case of equal couplings @xmath44 ( independent of @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the opposite situation ( in which @xmath21 is independent of @xmath50 ) takes place in the case in which the coupling matrix @xmath11 is proportional to a unitary matrix .",
    "the zero - order equations ( [ zodeau ] ) and ( [ zodebu ] ) representing separate channels have the simple analytical solutions @xmath51 the remaining equations ( [ zodeac ] ) and ( [ zodebc ] ) represent a set of @xmath28 two - state linear curve - crossing problems . in the limit @xmath52 , @xmath53 the transition amplitude in each of these systems",
    "is given by the lz formula .",
    "however , the solution of this problem converges to the asymptotic limit very slowly .",
    "we shall therefore use the exact solution of the linear two - state curve crossing problem , known since the pioneering work of zener @xcite .",
    "the two independent solutions @xmath54 , @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , can be expressed in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function @xmath57 ( see @xcite ) as @xmath58 where @xmath59 are , respectively , the lz exponent for the two - state crossing and the position of the crossing point on the time scale .",
    "the transition matrix @xmath60 , connecting the coefficients @xmath61 , @xmath62 at the boundaries @xmath63 and @xmath64 as @xmath65 can be expressed in terms of the fundamental solutions ( [ fundsol ] ) in the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 in our numerical calculations we expressed the confluent hypergeometric functions in terms of columbic wavefunctions , using the algorithm of @xcite for their evaluation .    when the original representation ( [ phieq ] ) is recovered by application of the transformation ( [ ab ] )",
    "one obtains the transition matrix @xmath68 , defined by @xmath69 in the zero - order approximation , as    [ sor ] @xmath70    where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "this solution constitutes the quasidegeneracy approximation .    whenever @xmath75 or @xmath76 are @xmath50-independent , and @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 ) , transitions between states within the corresponding set of @xmath79 ( or @xmath80 ) parallel potentials become forbidden due to the unitarity of matrices @xmath15 and @xmath81 .",
    "such an effect may take place if the couplings @xmath21 are close in magnitude or very small .",
    "if @xmath82 ( or @xmath83 ) such transitions vanish only at low couplings , in which case @xmath84 ( or @xmath85 ) are close to unity .",
    "the quasidegeneracy approximation described in sec.[sectran ] is applicable when the terms neglected in eqs.([zode ] ) yield sufficiently small contributions to the transition amplitudes .",

    "( [ lambda ] ) as the single expression @xmath108 these criteria allow for an interpretation that stems from the viewpoint of the uncertainty principle .",
    "equation ( [ ac ] ) means that the potentials become indistinguishable within a limited time interval . the second term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ac ] ) describes a broadening of the allowed uncertainty as the coupling increases .",
    "in the limiting case of a linear grid defined on the infinite time interval @xmath109 , some transitions become forbidden ( see @xcite ) . an example of such transitions",
    "is shown in fig.[figpot ] , in which two time - independent potentials are shown crossed by three parallel time - slanted potentials .",
    "the forbidden transitions , such as @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , are called counterintuitive , since in order to treat them as a sequence of independent two - state crossings , one has to assume a motion backwards in time .",
    "counterintuitive transitions can nonetheless occur , as has been proven in numerical calculations involving crossings of nonlinear potentials @xcite , and in uses of the quasidegeneracy approximation for truncated and piecewise linear problems , involving a set of horizontal potentials , crossed by one slanted potential @xcite .",
    "such transitions are present in truncated linear grids as well , since the transformations ( [ ab ] ) connect the initial and final states to all the decoupled channels .    hereafter we shall demonstrate the application of the quasidegeneracy approximation to a particular example . consider the model of a linear grid with @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 ( recalling that @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the time - independent parts of the slanted potentials ) . let the coupling matrix have one of the two special forms , either @xmath119 with integer values of @xmath120 , or the equal - coupling form , with @xmath121 all the following calculations are performed for the slope @xmath122 .",
    "the results can be readily expanded to other @xmath123 values by the substitutions @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 .",
    "figure [ figcoup ] presents the dependence of counterintuitive transition probabilities on the coupling strength @xmath127 for two cases : an exactly degenerate one ( @xmath128 ) , and a one in which @xmath129 , on the verge of the validity criteria ( [ ac ] ) . at low values of @xmath127 the amplitudes @xmath75 and @xmath130 in the decoupled representation eq.([sl ] )",
    "are close to unity and practically independent of @xmath50 , and therefore all transitions ( including counterintuitive ones ) within each of the two sets of parallel potentials in the original representation have small probabilities [ see discussion following eqs([sor ] ) ] . in cases in which the singular values are quite similar ,",
    "the probabilities of such transitions become small at high coupling strengths , since @xmath75 and @xmath130 are small for all @xmath50 ( see , for example , the plots for @xmath131 in fig .",
    "[ figcoup ] , where @xmath132 and @xmath133 ) .",
    "however , if the singular values of the coupling matrix are significantly different , the counterintuitive transitions remain significant over a wide range of coupling strengths as some of the amplitudes @xmath75 ( or @xmath130 ) are large , and some are small ( see the plots for @xmath134 in fig .",
    "[ figcoup ] , where @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) . in the case of a separable matrix",
    "( see the plot for @xmath137 in fig.[figcoup ] , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) , such transitions persist even in the limit of high coupling strength .",
    "it is worth noting that even a change of the phase of one element of the coupling matrix transforms a separable matrix to a non - separable one , and therefore changes the behavior of the transition probability at high values of the coupling strengths .",
    "counterintuitive transitions persist at finite values of the potential gap @xmath140 as well ( see figs .",
    "[ figcoup]b and [ figgap ] ) .",
    "as one can see , the higher is the coupling strength , the better are the results of the quasidegeneracy approximation [ in agreement with the criteria eq .",
    "( [ ac ] ) ] . at low coupling strengths the predictions of the quasidegeneracy approximation are correct as long as @xmath141 ( see [ figgap]a ) , while at high coupling strengths they are correct as long as @xmath142 ( see [ figgap]b ) .",
    "probabilities of counterintuitive transitions ( see fig.[figgap]b ) and other transitions ( see fig .  [ figosc ] ) demonstrate an oscillating pattern in their dependence on the potential gap .",
    "the nature of these oscillations is different from the well - known stckelberg oscillations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which may be present only in transitions including two or more interfering `` intuitive '' paths .",
    "( such paths exist in the transitions from 1 or 4 to 2 or 3 in the case presented in figs .",
    "[ figgap ] and [ figosc ] . )",
    "the period of the stckelberg oscillations is @xmath143 ; i.e. , it is dependent on the potential gap @xmath140 but independent of the time interval @xmath144 .",
    "these properties , as well as the magnitude of the stckelberg oscillation period , are not in agreement with the behavior of the oscillations presented in figs .",
    "[ figgap]b and [ figosc ] .",
    "the quasidegeneracy approximation relates the oscillations reported here to the interference of the terms in eqs .",
    "( [ sor ] ) , corresponding to different decoupled channels .",
    "the dependence on @xmath140 is due to exponents in eqs .",
    "( [ fundsol ] ) and in the second sum of each of the two equations ( [ soraa ] ) and ( [ sorbb ] ) .",
    "the oscillation period in @xmath140 is @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the ratio of the potential gaps in the original and decoupled representations .",
    "for the coupling matrix ( [ g2 ] ) we have @xmath147 , 5.3 , 4.0 , and 2.5 for @xmath148 , and 3 , respectively , which explains the variation of the oscillation period with @xmath120 in fig.[figgap ] .",
    "it is worth noting that in fig .",
    "[ figosc]b these oscillations are absent just for the transitions for which one would expect stckelberg oscillations ( @xmath149 and @xmath150 ) .",
    "the reason for not seeing stckelberg oscillations in our figures is simple .",
    "the scale of the plot is too small to show even a single stckelberg period . in the case of equal coupling",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ geq ] ) ] @xmath151 for all @xmath50 .",
    "this property results in the absence of oscillations in fig.[figosc]c .    there is still another kind of oscillations possible .",
    "it has been demonstrated in the case of a truncated two - state linear curve crossing , in which oscillations may show up as a function of each of the two truncation times ( see @xcite ) . in principle , such oscillations should also appear in our model in the @xmath140 dependence , since the crossing points move as the potential gap is varied .",
    "however , the period of these oscillations , too , is too large to show up in figs .  [ figgap ] and [ figosc ] .    in the limit of high coupling strengths or slow potential variation ( @xmath152 )",
    "the semiclassical approach of independent crossings predicts non - vanishing transitions only for one final state per a given initial state .",
    "if @xmath153 all the non - vanishing transitions lead from one set of the parallel potentials to another set , leading to a complete population transfer between the sets .",
    "this property was used in a recent proposal of single - electronics devices , based on transitions between quantum dots ( refs .",
    "in contrast , the quasidegeneracy approximation predicts more non - vanishing transitions ( see figs .",
    "[ figgap ] and [ figosc ] ) . in the case of @xmath154 ,",
    "a finite probability may remain for transitions within the same set of the parallel potentials ( see figs .",
    "[ figgap ] , [ figosc]b , and [ figosc]c ) , leading to an incomplete population transfer .",
    "this effect is similar to the effect of incomplete optical shielding in ultracold atom collisions @xcite .",
    "the effect of incomplete population transfer may interfere with the operation of the single - electronics devices mentioned above .",
    "equations ( [ sor ] ) describe the transition amplitudes in a truncated linear potential grid , whenever the applicability criteria ( [ ac ] ) are observed .",
    "the results can be applied also to a more general case , in which the grid may be broken into well - separated groups of quasidegenerate crossings . in this case",
    "the transition amplitudes can be represented as products of the transition amplitudes given by eqs .",
    "( [ sor ] ) for the quasidegenerate groups .",
