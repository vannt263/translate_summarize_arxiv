    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) established as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction takes a simple form @xcite , @xmath6 however , it is still hard to understand nonperturbative phenomena , such as color confinement and dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking , due to the infrared strong - coupling feature @xcite . in this decade ,",
    "lattice qcd monte carlo calculations have been developed and have been mainly applied to ( i ) _ hadron spectroscopy _ and ( ii ) _ finite temperature qcd phase transition _ , with a great success .",
    "however , lattice qcd is applicable also to ( iii ) _ quark hadron physics _ and",
    "( iv ) _ confinement physics _ , as a useful and reliable method .",
    "our group is aiming to construct quark hadron physics and confinement physics based on lattice qcd .",
    "our strategy is to adopt lattice qcd calculations to the relevant quantities pointed out in quark hadron physics or confinement physics , in order to obtain the reliable physical picture based on qcd .    in relation to quark hadron physics , we are investigating several important subjects in quark hadron physics using su(3)@xmath0 lattice qcd at the quenched level as follows .    1 .",
    "we numerically derive the static three - quark ( 3q ) potential @xmath7 at @xmath1 , which is responsible to the baryon properties , and find that @xmath7 is well reproduced by the sum of a constant , the coulomb term and the linear confinement term proportional to the total flux - tube length , with the accuracy better than a few % [ 3 - 5 ] .",
    "2 .   from the polyakov - loop correction",
    ", we obtain the q-@xmath8 potential and the 3q potential at @xmath2 , which characterize the hadron structure at @xmath2 .",
    "3 .   we measure the lowest mass of the positive and the negative parity baryons in singlet , octet and decuplet representations of the su(3 ) flavor , respectively @xcite .",
    "the experimentally observed @xmath9 is much lighter than the corresponding baryon with the mass of 1.6gev on the lattice , which may suggest the @xmath10 molecule picture for @xmath9 .",
    "the octet - decuplet baryon mass splitting is also investigated .",
    "we are investigating the glueball properties both at @xmath1 and at @xmath2 .    here ,",
    "for the accurate measurement of the 3q potential at @xmath1 and the lowest hadron mass in each channel , we adopt the _ smearing technique _ which reduces the excited - state contamination .",
    "furthermore , to get maximal information on the temporal correlation , we use _ anisotropic lattices _ where the temporal lattice spacing @xmath11 is finer than the spatial lattice spacing @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the anisotropic lattice is quite useful for the finite temperature qcd , because of the limitation of the temporal distance @xcite .",
    "since these studies are introduced in [ 5 - 7 ] , we mainly present the recent progress of our studies on confinement physics based on su(2 ) lattice qcd at the quenched level .",
    "to understand the confinement mechanism is one of the most difficult problems remaining in the particle physics .",
    "as the regge trajectories and lattice qcd calculations indicate , quark confinement is characterized by _ one - dimensional squeezing _ of the color - electric flux and the _ string tension _",
    "@xmath13 , which is the key quantity of confinement . on the confinement mechanism ,",
    "nambu first proposed the _ dual superconductor theory _ for quark confinement @xcite , based on the electro - magnetic duality in 1974 . in this theory , there occurs the one - dimensional squeezing of the color - electric flux by the _ dual meissner effect _ due to condensation of bosonic color - magnetic monopoles .",
    "however , there are _ two large gaps _ between qcd and the dual superconductor theory [ 2,9 - 11 ]    1 .",

    "2 .   the dual superconductor theory requires color - magnetic monopole condensation as the key concept , while qcd does not have color magnetic monopoles as the elementary degrees of freedom .",
    "these gaps may be simultaneously fulfilled by taking _",
    "ma gauge fixing , _ which reduces qcd to an abelian gauge theory including color - magnetic monopoles .    in euclidean qcd , the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge is defined so as to minimize the total amount of the off - diagonal gluons [ 2,9 - 11 ] @xmath14 \\equiv",

    "off - diagonal gluons behave as charged matter fields like @xmath22 in the standard model , and provide the color - electric current in terms of the residual abelian gauge symmetry . in addition",
    ", color - magnetic monopoles appear as topological objects reflecting the nontrivial homotopy group [ 2,9 - 14 ] @xmath23 in a similar manner to similarly in the gut monopole . here , the global weyl symmetry and color - magnetic monopoles are relics of nonabelian nature of qcd .    in this way , in the ma gauge , qcd is reduced into an abelian gauge theory including color - magnetic monopoles , which is expected to provide a theoretical basis of the dual superconductor theory for quark confinement .",
    "furthermore , recent lattice qcd studies show remarkable features of _ abelian dominance _ and _ monopole dominance _ for nonperturbative qcd ( np - qcd ) in the ma gauge .    1 .   without gauge fixing ,",
    "all the gluon components equally contribute to np - qcd , and it is difficult to extract relevant degrees of freedom for np - qcd .",
    "2 .   in the ma gauge",

    "( see fig.3(a ) . ) in the ma gauge , lattice qcd shows _ abelian dominance _ for np - qcd ( confinement @xcite , gluon propagators @xcite , chiral symmetry breaking @xcite ) : only the diagonal gluon is relevant for np - qcd , while off - diagonal gluons do not contribute to np - qcd .",

    "[ 17 - 19 ] for np - qcd : the monopole part leads to np - qcd , while the photon part seems trivial like qed and does not contribute to np - qcd .",
    "for example , on the q-@xmath31 potential , the purely linear potential appears in the monopole part , while the coulomb potential appears in the photon part like qed @xcite .",
    "thus , in the ma gauge , qcd is reduced into an abelian gauge theory with color - magnetic monopoles , _ keeping essence of infrared nonperturbative features _ , and the _ relevant collective mode for np - qcd _ can be extracted as the color - magnetic monopole .      to find out essence of the ma gauge , we study the off - diagonal gluon field @xmath32 in the ma gauge in su(2 ) lattice qcd .",

    "<S> we are aiming to construct quark hadron physics and confinement physics based on qcd . using su(3)@xmath0 lattice </S>",
    "<S> qcd , we are investigating the three - quark potential at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , mass spectra of positive and negative - parity baryons in the octet and the decuplet representations of the su(3 ) flavor , glueball properties at @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we study also confinement physics using lattice qcd . in the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge , </S>",
    "<S> the off - diagonal gluon amplitude is strongly suppressed , and then the off - diagonal gluon phase shows strong randomness , which leads to a large effective off - diagonal gluon mass , @xmath3 . due to the large off - diagonal gluon mass in the ma gauge </S>",
    "<S> , infrared qcd is abelianized like nonabelian higgs theories . in the ma gauge , there appears a macroscopic network of the monopole world - line covering the whole system . from the monopole current , we extract the dual gluon field @xmath4 , and examine the longitudinal magnetic screening . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath5 0.5 gev in the infrared region , which indicates the dual higgs mechanism by monopole condensation . from infrared abelian dominance and infrared monopole condensation , low - energy qcd in the ma gauge </S>",
    "<S> is described with the dual ginzburg - landau ( dgl ) theory . </S>"
