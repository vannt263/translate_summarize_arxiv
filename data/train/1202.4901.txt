    "we investigate the evolution of binary systems that leads to the formation of close double compact objects ( dcos ) merging within a hubble time : double neutron star ( ns - ns ) , black hole ",
    "neutron star ( bh - ns ) , and double black hole ( bh - bh ) systems . only isolated evolution ( i.e. , in field populations ) is considered .",
    "several different groups have provided similar estimates and studies in the past decade @xcite .",
    "the exploration of the relevant physical processes and rate estimates were obtained with the startrack population synthesis code @xcite . in this paper",
    "we revisit these rate estimates , incorporating recent improvements to the input physics within the startrack code .",
    "similar rate estimates performed for dense populations in which dynamical interactions between stars are important ( i.e. , globular clusters ) have been presented elsewhere @xcite .    to describe the formation of a double compact object one needs to know the history of both progenitors , as well as the interactions between them . however , the uncertainties associated with a number of evolutionary processes inhibit an accurate description . among the most important unknowns",
    "are the details of the common envelope ( ce ) phase , the unknown maximum mass of the ns , the physics of the supernova explosions that form compact objects , and the wind mass loss rates of their progenitors . in this paper",
    "we approach the problem by calculating and investigating a suite of population synthesis models .",
    "the uncertainties are assessed by altering the parameters and input physics within defined limits .",
    "this allows us to  bracket \" our ignorance of the physical processes that are crucial for understanding double compact object formation .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the physics associated with the ce phase , focusing on the binding energy parameter , @xmath1 , and the structure of the donor star .",
    "we introduce a new treatment of the ns / bh formation processes in core collapse supernovae , and assess the role of natal kicks , the maximum ns mass , and wind mass loss on the rates . to show the basic dependence of our results on metallicity , we consider two fiducial stellar populations : @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "our main results are presented in fig .  [ 02rates ] and",
    "[ 002rates ]",
    ". a broader metallicity study will be presented in paper ii of this series , with inclusion of the cosmic star formation history , and a calculation of the dependence of rates on redshift .",
    "paper iii will examine the detection prognosis with advanced gravitational telescopes ( e.g. advanced ligo / virgo , einstein telescope ) , incorporating the latest gravitational waveforms and sensitivity curves for the various instruments .    in order to make the results of our research easily accessible to the community , we have provided an on - line synthetic universe database , available at www.syntheticuniverse.org . at present",
    "this contains detailed information on the population synthesis models in this paper .",
    "in addition , a number of physical parameters and their distributions that are not discussed here in detail ( e.g. , initial binary parameters , component masses , mass ratios , evolutionary tracks ) are also provided , for those who might want to include them in their own research .",
    "we intend this database to act as an extension to our three papers , functioning as a repository of the full spectrum of our double compact object populations .",
    "the  synthetic universe \" site will be updated in real time as new physical models are calculated , and will respond to requests from the scientific community .",
    "eventually , the synthetic universe will include various objects in addition to double compact object binaries , for example stellar populations with white dwarfs ( e.g. , supernovae ia progenitors ; low frequency gravitational wave sources ; cataclysmic variables ) and various types of x - ray binaries ( e.g. , persistent and transient sources ; high- and low - mass x - ray binaries in galactic and extra - galactic environments ) .    in the next section",
    "we describe recent physical developments addressing the ce events , the wind mass loss rates from massive stars , supernovae explosions and compact object formation , incorporated into the startrack code .",
    "section [ modeling ] contains a general description of the most important physical parameters used in our population synthesis , while in section [ results ] we present the models used in this study , and our results .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section [ dis ] .",
    "we have used the population synthesis code startrack to calculate the numbers and properties of dcos .",
    "the full description of the code can be found in @xcite .",
    "the code utilizes a set of stellar models ( @xcite ; slightly modified from its original version ) that allow for the evolution of stars at different metallicities .",
    "the model for compact object formation adopted in the code has been significantly revised ; changes are described in section [ cof ] . during core collapse",
    ", fallback and direct bh formation is now accounted for @xcite and the newly born objects receive natal kicks @xcite .",
    "the formation of low mass nss through electron capture supernovae is also accounted for ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "binary interactions are treated in detail , and the various physical processes have been calibrated using either results of detailed evolutionary calculations ( e.g. , @xcite for mass transfer sequences ) , or specific sets of observations ( e.g. , @xcite for tidal interactions ) .    in the following sections we describe the major updates to the code that are relevant for the formation of bhs and nss .",
    "these crucial improvements are based on advances in stellar evolution physics in the last decade .",
    "included are revised rates for wind mass loss for massive stars that now allow for the formation of bhs with masses observed in the milky way and other galaxies ( see section [ winds ] ) .",
    "another improvement relates to the ce coefficient , @xmath1 , describing the binding energy of the envelope .",
    "it is now dependent upon the parameters ( mass , radius , etc . ) and the evolutionary stage of the donor .",
    "this is a major improvement when compared to most previous studies , where @xmath1 was considered constant throughout the evolution of the donor ( section [ ce ] ) .",
    "the third major update regards the core collapse / supernova explosions , and the resulting model for compact object formation .",
    "we introduce two convection - enhanced , neutrino driven supernova engines ( based on rayleigh - taylor and standing accretion shock instabilities ) into our population synthesis code .",
    "this addition allows us to account for the dearth of galactic compact objects within the mass range @xmath4 ( the so called `` mass gap '' ( section [ cof ] ) ) .",
    "the startrack code was recently updated with new wind mass loss rates ( described in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "one of the major changes was the implementation of mass loss for o / b stars based on @xcite , followed by new winds for wolf - rayet stars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the luminous blue variable winds ( based on @xcite ) were calibrated so as to allow for the formation of bhs with masses up to @xmath5 in a solar metallicity environment .",
    "this was done in order to account for the observed masses of known bhs in the milky way ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the most important consequence of these updates is the possibility of the formation of bhs with masses up to @xmath6 in sub - solar metallicity environments ( @xmath7 ) , which corresponds to the observed mass of the most massive known stellar - mass bh in the ic10 x-1 binary @xcite",
    ". these revisions also result in the formation of bhs with masses up to @xmath0 in a low metallicity ( @xmath8 ) environment .",
    "we begin with an expression describing the energy balance of the ce @xcite : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the roche lobe radius of the donor at the onset of roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) , @xmath11 is the binary separation , @xmath12 is the mass of the ejected envelope , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the masses of the donor and accretor , respectively .",
    "indices @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for initial and final parameters , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 describes the efficiency of the transfer of orbital energy into unbinding the envelope .",
    "if there is sufficient orbital energy to unbind the envelope the binary may survive the ce phase , otherwise the component merger and the formation of a peculiar single object is assumed ( an example : if the accretor is a compact object then in the outcome of the ce a star harbouring a ns / bh may form ) .",
    "the value of @xmath18 has been set to @xmath19 throughout this study .",
    "the range of values for the product @xmath20 may therefore be covered by @xmath1 alone .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 describes the binding energy of the envelope , and is defined as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the radius of the donor , which becomes equal to the roche lobe radius of the donor at the onset of the ce .",
    "the most significant changes of binding energy are usually associated with radial expansion or contraction of a star .",
    "additionally , the mass loss / gain may alter the binding energy .",
    "generally , as the envelope of the star expands it becomes less dense and so its binding energy decreases , while a contraction of the envelope leads to an increase in the binding energy .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is a function of binding energy , radius , and mass ( eq .  [ ebindeq ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath1 will decrease if the radius expands faster than the binding energy decreases , which is the case for stars on the hertzsprung gap ( hg ) stars ( fig .  [ lam10][lam60 ] ) .",
    "if the radial expansion of a star remains moderate , @xmath1 may increase as it happens on the red giant branch ( rgb ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) ( see fig .",
    "[ lam10 ] ) .",
    "for the most massive stars ( initial mass above @xmath23 ) the mass loss becomes a significant factor , and the changes in density profile , radius , and binding energy result in an almost constant @xmath1 during later evolutionary stages ( see fig .  [ lam20][lam60 ] ) .",
    "most importantly , eq",
    ".  [ ebindeq ] implies that given the mass , radius , and evolutionary state ( i.e. the envelope size ) of a donor , a change of @xmath1 will change the binding energy of its envelope .",
    "for example , the binding energy of the envelope of a star with @xmath24 will be larger by an order of magnitude as compared to an identical star with @xmath25 . during the ce phase ,",
    "orbital energy is used to eject the envelope .",
    "therefore , a binary will have much more difficulty ejecting the tightly bound envelope of a donor with @xmath24 , as compared with one with @xmath25 .",
    "the consequences for the formation of double compact objects are twofold . if @xmath1 has a low value , and the stars have insufficient separation ( orbital energy ) , they will merge during the ce phase .",
    "this terminates further binary evolution and prevents the formation of a dco .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath1 has a high value , it is most likely that a given system will eject the ce with a small resulting decrease in orbital separation .",
    "binaries ( later becoming dcos ) retaining a wide enough separation after the ce event may not be able to merge within a a hubble time .",
    "such dcos become uninteresting from the gravitational wave detection perspective . also , a supernova explosion occurring in a binary that maintains a wide orbital separation tends to disrupt the system .",
    "the outcome of the ce phase depends strongly on the evolutionary stage of the donor , as first discussed in  @xcite . even before considering the energy balance , it is critical to incorporate an understanding of the core - envelope structure of the star .",
    "for example , main sequence ( ms ) stars do not have clear core - envelope division , as the helium core is still in the process of being developed .",
    "stars on the hg similarly lack a clear entropy jump associated with the core - envelope structure @xcite , although when in the evolution such a division appears ( late hg or post hg ? ) remains unclear . in the case of a ce initiated by a ms or hg donor ,",
    "therefore , the orbital energy is transferred into the entire star rather than just the envelope .",
    "this makes the ejection of the envelope difficult , and for ms stars we assume that this will always result in a merger .",
    "however , in the case of hg we extend the analysis by considering two possibilities .",
    "one is to ignore the core - envelope boundary issue , and proceed with the calculation of the energy balance ( submodel a ) .",
    "the second is to adopt a pessimistic approach ( submodel b ) in which each ce with a hg donor leads ( independent of energy balance ) to a merger .",
    "both submodels are calculated for each evolutionary model in this study .",
    "massive stars , beyond hg , that enter the core helium burning already possess well - defined core - envelope structure and require only the energy balance calculation .",
    "exceptions are the helium ms and helium hg stars , which have an analogous structure to their hydrogen counterparts , and are treated as such .",
    "the first attempts to use physical ( calculated rather than assumed ) values of @xmath1 coefficient were presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a study by @xcite followed soon after , discussing in detail @xmath1 values lower than @xmath19 .",
    "the authors of the two former papers evaluated the binding energy for stars that are potential neutron star progenitors ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the actual @xmath1 values were presented for about ten stellar models with different initial mass ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "later , @xcite extended the initial work to calculate with physical @xmath1 populations of galactic double compact objects , including evolution of massive stars that are progenitors of black holes .",
    "unfortunately , the values of @xmath1 coefficients for massive stars were not tabulated and we were unable to base our calculations on this study .",
    "however , it is worth noting that these initial studies , made it clear that the value of physical @xmath1 is rather sensitive to the definition of the core - envelope boundary . in any realistic calculation of envelope binding energy the exact location of this boundary in a given star needs to be assumed and it is not entirely clear how to define this point @xcite . within the realistic limits on the exact location of core - envelope boundary",
    "one may expect an uncertainty of a factor of @xmath29 on a double compact object merger rates ( 2012 , t.tauris , private communication ) .",
    "a physical estimate of @xmath1 was recently presented by two groups : @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we adopt the expressions from the former group in the startrack code , although both calculations yield similar results for ns / bh progenitors .",
    "the new @xmath1 values cover ce events , and depend on the evolutionary stage of the donor , its mass at zero age main sequence ( zams ) and the mass of its envelope , and its radius .",
    "in addition , all of these quantities can depend on a wide range of metallicities ( @xmath30@xmath31 ) .",
    "this represents a significant improvement in the physics of the formation of dcos , as most previous studies treated @xmath1 as constant ( usually @xmath25 ) throughout the evolution of a star . in the new approach",
    "the authors calculate two values of @xmath1 from detailed stellar models : in the first they treat the binding energy of the donor s envelope as consisting only of its gravitational energy , while in the second the binding energy is decreased by the full internal energy of the envelope . since neither of these extremes is plausible @xcite",
    ", we choose our @xmath1 to be the average of the two . in the case of stars with masses leading to the formation of bhs we find that @xmath32 ( see fig .  [ lam40],[lam60 ] ) .",
    "we find higher values for typical ns progenitors , and especially in the late evolutionary stages we have @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "[ lam10 ] ) .",
    "since the group that developed this procedure is affiliated with nanjing university , we label this approach as the _ nanjing _ @xmath1 .",
    "we have additionally requested that the authors compute a few extra models for massive stars , as these are particularly relevant to our study .",
    "@xcite presents models up to @xmath34 , and we have now obtained models up to @xmath35 .",
    "we then extrapolate these to our entire mass range ( up to @xmath36 ) . for stars with @xmath37",
    "we use the fitting function calculated for @xmath38 , but input the higher mass when necessary .",
    "we acknowledge that recently similar population synthesis studies were performed .",
    "two most notable are : a study by @xcite ( performed with the seba code , more details in section [ compseba ] ) on the mergers of black hole systems and a study by @xcite ( using the @xcite code fused with several startrack procedures ) on short gamma - ray bursts . however , in contrast to the input physics in our work , the mentioned codes utilize a constant @xmath1 value .      to evolve a star from zams toward its eventual supernova ( sn ) with the startrack code , we use the ( slightly modified ; see @xcite ) procedure presented in @xcite , with updated wind mass loss rates as described in section [ winds ] . the mass of the compact object is calculated from the properties of the pre - supernova star , and the type ( whether it is a ns or a bh ) is set solely by its mass .",
    "we use a recent study by @xcite to describe the sn explosion and the resulting compact object formation .",
    "our models allow for a successful explosion without the need for the artificial injection of energy into the exploding star .",
    "this is a major update of the input physics used in the population synthesis of massive binaries .",
    "previous studies at best used significantly outdated supernova models , if they used any at all .",
    "we have introduced two alternative supernova models into our code :  delayed \" and  rapid \" .",
    "both are core - collapse scenarios , and they share the same convection - enhanced neutrino - driven explosion mechanism . the main factor that differentiates the two models is the type of instability which causes the macroscopic flows of matter ( similar to convection ) that eventually lead to the ejection of the infalling matter .",
    "the delayed model is sourced from the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) , and can produce an explosion as late as @xmath39 after bounce , while the rapid model starts from the rayleigh - taylor instability and occurs within the first @xmath40@xmath41 . in the rapid scenario",
    "we either end up with a very strong ( high velocity kick ) supernova in the case of a low mass star ( @xmath42 ) , and produce a ns , or the supernova fails , and there is direct collapse to a massive bh . in the delayed case the entire spectrum of explosion energies",
    "is allowed , and this results in a wide range of compact object masses , from nss to light bhs to massive bhs .",
    "the formulae describing the two supernova engines adopted in startrack are provided in @xcite ( eqs .",
    "1517 for the rapid and 1820 for the delayed engine ) .",
    "we also allow for the formation of nss through electron capture supernovae ( ecs , @xcite ) .",
    "these are weak supernovae ( no natal kick assumed ) occurring for the lowest mass stars ( @xmath43 ) , and they end up forming nss .",
    "the physics underlying the formation of double compact objects is uncertain , notably due to modelling challenges of the supernova and ce phases .",
    "core collapse , usually ( but not always ) followed by a supernova explosion , forms a compact object .",
    "the mass and the type of compact object is determined by the details of the event .",
    "additionally , supernova asymmetry via mass loss and/or a natal kick may disrupt a binary , depleting the population of double compact objects . at the same time , for some binaries a natal kick of the right amplitude and direction may produce a prematurely coalescing dco .",
    "the ce phase is present in all formation scenarios , for all types of close double compact objects .",
    "it is the primary mechanism for bringing initially widely - separated binaries into close orbits , thereby allowing them to coalesce within a hubble time .    to explore the uncertainties associated with our models we calculate a suite of population synthesis results , investigating a range of factors which have the largest impact on the rates and physical properties of dcos . as a reference we use the standard model introduced in section  [ stan ] , that resembles input physics described in detail in @xcite , with some important additions and modifications .",
    "the subsequent models are variations on this standard model , each exploring a single parameter connected to either the core collapse / supernova explosion or ce phases . despite the fact that we now have physically motivated values for @xmath1 , we also explore models",
    "in which @xmath1 is constant , with the specific value set over a wide range .",
    "the range is chosen to be such as to encompass all plausible values allowed by detailed physical calculation of the _ nanjing _ results @xcite .",
    "variations 14 employ @xmath440.01 , 0.1 , 1 , and 10 , respectively ( see table [ pstudy ] ) .    to delineate between a ns and a bh we need to adopt a value for the maximum ns mass .",
    "theoretical studies of the equation of state allow values in the range @xmath45@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "observations yield a narrower range , with the most massive nss reaching @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "statistical analyses of the measured bh masses indicate that the bh mass distribution is unlikely to extend below about @xmath48 @xcite , which leaves a significant range with no compact objects .",
    "this might argue for a higher upper limit on the ns mass ( or even potentially a lower limit on the bh mass ? ) . utilizing the theoretical and observational estimates , we vary the maximum ns mass from @xmath46 ( variation 5 ) , through @xmath49 ( standard ) , and as low as @xmath50 ( variation 6 ) .    in the standard model for natal kicks in core collapse supernovae",
    "we employ a maxwellian kick distribution with @xmath51 km s@xmath52 , based on observed velocities of single galactic pulsars @xcite . during the explosion , parts or all of the ejected mass may not reach escape velocity due to _ ( i ) _ the strong gravitational potential generated by the newly formed compact object and _ ( ii ) _ the decreasing explosion energy with the mass of exploding star . in the asymmetric mass ejection kick mechanism ( adopted here )",
    "it makes bh natal kicks smaller as compared with ns kicks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to account for this effect we use a simple linear formula describing the reduction of natal kick magnitude by the amount of fallback during a sn : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the final magnitude of the natal kick , @xmath55 is the velocity drawn from a maxwellian kick distribution , and @xmath56 is the fallback factor .",
    "the values of @xmath56 range between 01 , with 0 indicating no fallback / full kick and 1 representing total fallback / no kick ( in this case a  silent supernova \" ) .",
    "this factor is calculated for both the delayed and rapid sn engines according to @xcite . for the electron capture supernovae",
    "the explosions are found to be symmetric @xcite , and we assume no natal kick .",
    "however , the orbit is still modified due to the mass loss in the explosion .",
    "bhs that form through partial fall back are assumed to receive natal kicks that are drawn from the same distribution as for the nss , but the value is decreased in proportion to the amount of fall back . in particular , the most massive bhs form via full fall back , which leads to no natal kick and `` silent '' bh formation .",
    "this may be supported both theoretically @xcite and from observations @xcite .",
    "there seems to be some evidence that nss that are found in binaries receive smaller natal kicks ( e.g. , @xcite ) , of the order of @xmath57 km s@xmath52 . keeping the same maxwellian distribution as in the standard model ,",
    "we modify the magnitude of natal kicks of nss and bhs to @xmath58 km s@xmath52 ( variation 7 ) .    additionally , we calculate two models in which the bh kicks take on two extreme values . in one ,",
    "newly formed bhs receive full natal kicks as , observed for single pulsars ( @xmath51 km s@xmath52 ) independent of the amount of fallback ( variation 8) . in the other , no natal kicks are applied to bhs , independent of their mass or the amount of fallback ( variation 9 ) .    as our standard model we select the rapid supernova engine , since this supernova mechanism , combined with binary evolution , successfully reproduces the mass gap @xcite observed in galactic x - ray binaries @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the delayed engine ( variation 10 ) , as well as the routine previously implemented within startrack @xcite , generates a continuous spectrum of compact object masses .",
    "observational and theoretical developments have led to the discovery of a number of puzzling phenomena in the winds from massive stars . the two most prominent are the  weak wind problem \" ( e.g. , @xcite ) and  wind clumping \" ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the former is related to the fact that wind mass loss rates from late o and early b type stars might be @xmath592 orders of magnitude lower than theoretically predicted .",
    "the latter suggests that winds might be forming dense clumps rather than being distributed uniformly , which may lead to an overestimate of mass loss rates by a factor of @xmath60 .",
    "based on this we investigate the possibility that our wind mass loss rates are too high , and so we calculate a model ( variation 11 ) in which the rates are reduced by a factor of 2 .",
    "this is done for all stars at all points in their nuclear evolution .",
    "the standard model utilizes detailed calculations of stable , nuclear and thermal timescale , mass transfer episodes .",
    "the model distinguishes between nuclear and thermal timescale transfers , also accounting for contributions from magnetic braking , gravitational radiation and tidal interactions ( for details see @xcite  section 5 ) .",
    "these calculations have been calibrated on massive binaries that are relevant for dco formation ( e.g. @xcite ; for further details see @xcite  section 8) . during",
    "mass transfer episodes it is not known how much of the transferred mass is retained within the given binary and how much mass is lost entirely from the system . in our standard prescription",
    "we set the mass transfer to be half - conservative .",
    "this means that half of the mass that is transferred from the donor is accreted onto the companion and the rest is expelled to infinity .",
    "the specifics of the angular momentum loss associated with the expelled matter are presented in eq .",
    "32 & 33 in @xcite .",
    "the accretion rate in an rlof mass transfer ( @xmath61 ) is given by the formula : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the donor s rlof mass transfer rate and @xmath64 sets the level of conservativeness ( @xmath65 for the standard model , half - conservative ) .",
    "if the transfer rate exceeds the eddington limit , then more accreted mass can be ejected .",
    "we additionally investigated two cases : a fully conservative ( variation 12 , @xmath66 ) and fully non - conservative ( variation 13 , @xmath67 ) mass transfer .",
    "we also include two additional models investigating the common envelope parameter @xmath1 .",
    "however , in contrast to variations 14 we allow it to vary physically according to the _ nanjing _ prescription while boosting it by a constant value . in variation 14 we multiply @xmath1 by a factor of @xmath68 , which causes the binding energy of the envelope to decrease by the same factor .",
    "this is done to account for the possibility that not only internal energy but enthalpy may be the agent that causes the ejection of the envelope , making it easier in consequence @xcite . to investigate the aforementioned core - envelope boundary problem ( see section [ newlam ] ) , which may cause @xmath1 to vary significantly we present variation 15 . here",
    "we divide @xmath1 by a factor of @xmath68 , which in turn increases the binding energy .",
    "the aforementioned boundary problem may also boost @xmath1 , however high values of this parameter are already covered in variations 4 and 14 .",
    "table  [ pstudy ] lists all of our models , each with the relevant parameter to be varied as compared to our standard model ( listed in the first row ) .",
    "each model is calculated for two metallicity values : solar ( @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 solar ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "each model is further divided into submodel a ( ce energy balance with hg donor ) and submodel b ( ce merger with hg donor ) as discussed in section  [ hgtreatment ] .",
    "we end up with @xmath72 distinctive models ( 15 variations for 2 metallicities and 2 ce submodels , on top of our standard model ) .    for each model",
    "we evolve @xmath73 binaries ( with one exception , see .",
    "[ v4 ] ) , assuming that each component is created at the same time .",
    "each binary system is initialized by four parameters which are assumed to be independent .",
    "these are : primary mass @xmath74 ( initially more massive component ) , mass ratio @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the mass of the secondary component ( initially less massive ) , the semi - major axis @xmath77 of the orbit , and the eccentricity @xmath78 .",
    "the mass of the primary component is randomly chosen from the initial mass function adopted from @xcite , and @xcite , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is our standard choice for field populations .",
    "stars are generated from within an initial mass range @xmath81@xmath82 , with the limits based on the targeted stellar population . for example , ns studies require evolution of single stars within the range @xmath83@xmath84 , while for bhs the lower limit is @xmath85 .",
    "binary evolution may broaden these ranges due to mass transfer episodes , and we therefore set the minimum mass of the primary to @xmath86 .",
    "we assume a flat mass ratio distribution , @xmath87 , over the range @xmath881 , in agreement with recent observations  @xcite .",
    "given a value of the primary mass and the mass ratio , we obtain the mass of the secondary from @xmath89 .",
    "however , for the same reasons as for the primary , we do nt consider binaries where the mass of the secondary is below @xmath90 .",
    "the distribution of initial binary separations is assumed to be flat in @xmath91  @xcite , and so @xmath92 , with @xmath77 ranging from values such that at zams the primary fills no more than 50% of its roche lobe to @xmath93 .",
    "for the initial eccentricity we adopt a thermal equilibrium distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath94 , with @xmath78 ranging from @xmath95 to @xmath19 .",
    "the double compact object merger rates for a synthetic galaxy resembling the milky way , but for two differing values of metallicity , are presented in table  [ gmerger02 ] ( @xmath2 ) and table  [ gmerger002 ] ( @xmath96 ) .",

    "these changes reflect the fact that since the previous study we have introduced physical @xmath1 values and observationally constrained sn models , which yields a new compact object mass spectrum .",
    "a general division of these rates by dco type may be understood in the following way .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) falls steeply with mass , and delivers more ns than bh progenitors ( by a factor@xmath128 ( ns progenitors ) to the number of stars between @xmath129@xmath130 ( bh progenitors ) as calculated from the imf ( see section [ modeling ] ) .",

    "the supernova explosion is the major process that drastically affects the number of massive binaries , as the explosions tend to disrupt binaries .",
    "this is especially true in the case of ns progenitors , as these receive large natal kicks and as many as @xmath132@xmath133 of potential binaries may end up disrupted after the first supernova explosion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "supernovae do not affect binaries with bhs as much because it is believed that most of the massive stars producing bhs do not experience large kicks at core collapse .",
    "what follows is that the rates for ns - ns and bh - bh mergers are not as separated as would be simply deduced from the imf .",
    "the rates are also very sensitive to the details of the ce , and these are quite different for ns and bh progenitors ( as discussed below ) . additionally , the three types of double compact objects evolve along separate evolutionary channels ( see table [ channels ] ) .",
    "this qualitative picture can explain the calculated ratio of ns - ns to bh - bh merger rates ( @xmath134@xmath135 ) .",
    "the bh - ns merger rates are the smallest , as the majority of potential progenitor binaries have initially large mass ratios , and the first interaction of the two components leads to a ce phase and the inevitable merger .",
    "this happens because the massive envelope of the bh progenitor can not be successfully dispersed by the much less massive ns progenitor .",
    "note that none of the significant bh - ns formation channels starts with the ce phase , but instead the progenitors of these systems originate from a narrow mass range ( mass ratio of the two components larger than @xmath136@xmath137 allowing for the first interaction to be a stable rlof ( see table [ channels ] ) .    at sub - solar metallicity",
    "other factors come into play and make bh - bh systems dominant in the overall merger rate .",
    "first , the smaller wind mass loss makes pre - sn progenitors of nss slightly more massive ( by @xmath114 ) .",
    "heavier ns progenitors tend to explode as core collapse supernovae ( full kicks ) rather than ecse ( no kicks , see section  [ cof ] ) .",
    "this means that for sub - solar metallicity more nss are formed with disruptive natal kicks than for a solar environment .",
    "additionally , smaller wind mass loss decreases the expansion of the separation between the components .",
    "this causes the progenitors of ns - ns systems , at sub - solar metallicities , to engage in a second ce ( see table  [ channels2 ] ) just after the first one .",
    "this increases the probability of a merger during evolution when compared with@xmath138 , hence the drop of merger rates of ns - ns systems from@xmath138 to @xmath139 .",
    "the merger rates for bh - bh systems increase for sub - solar metallicity , as low wind mass loss rates allow the progenitors to remain more massive during evolution .",
    "this in turn makes the pre - sn stars more massive and allows for larger amount of fallback .",
    "increased fallback reduces the magnitude of the natal kicks ( see eq .",
    "[ vkick ] ) to almost none or none at all ( direct collapse into a bh ) and makes the sn significantly less disruptive , as explained in detail by @xcite .    the formation of bh - ns binaries is determined by the properties of the progenitors of both compact object types .",
    "therefore , the behaviour of these systems may be considered as a combination of effects noted in the formation of bh - bh and ns - ns systems .    in figures",

    "for ns - ns progenitors ( top panel ) , the masses of the primary components ( up to @xmath140 ) exceed the typical upper limit for the formation of a ns for single stars ( @xmath23 , also lower limit for the formation of a bh ) . under favourable circumstances , binary evolution may push this limit even further , up to @xmath141 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that for bh - ns systems ( middle panel ) , a high progenitor mass does not necessarily imply that it will form a bh . during their evolution , progenitors of bh - ns systems may undergo a mass ratio reversal ( due to mass transfer events ) so the primary component ( initially more massive ) may become a ns ( as seen on the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ mrem ] ) . for bh - bh progenitors",
    "the lowest mass of the primary component is @xmath142 , and the lowest mass of the secondary is @xmath143 .",
    "also , progenitor stars of bh - bh systems have a wide mass distribution ( ranging up to @xmath130 ) . however , the masses peak at @xmath144 for the primary component and @xmath145 for the secondary .    the distribution of masses of dco remnants ( fig .",
    "[ mrem ] ) clearly shows the gap between the upper mass achievable by nss ( @xmath47 , despite allowing for the formation of nss with mass up to @xmath49 ) and the lower mass of bhs ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "this is due to the implementation of the rapid supernova engine , which is the first to successfully reproduce this  mass gap \" ( for details see section [ cof ] ) .",
    "additionally , for bh - ns binaries some remnants formed out of the initially less massive star in the binary fall within the bh mass regime while some primary components ( initially more massive ) may end up as nss .",
    "this is due to the aforementioned mass ratio reversal . despite a wide range of bh - bh progenitor masses , the component masses of remnant systems are mostly clustering around @xmath68@xmath147 .",
    "such a drastic reduction in mass range comes from the significant wind mass loss for massive bh progenitors and mass ejection in ce events .",
    "both factors usually reduce the masses of the whole progenitor stars to the masses of their cores , for which the mass range is narrow .    to calculate the chirp mass @xmath148 of a dco we use the following formula : @xmath149 where @xmath150 are the masses of the components . the most notable aspect of the chirp mass distributions ( fig .",

    "this scenario meets the criteria of a and b submodels and allows the binaries to be accounted in both ( in terms of forming merging dcos ) .",
    "submodel b , therefore , favours binaries with larger separations , which translate into larger merger times",
    ".    additionally , the delay times decrease with metallicity .",
    "this comes from the fact that for sub - solar environments stars lose less mass in winds and therefore , form more massive remnants .",
    "the more massive the components of a dco , the less time it takes for a system to merge . a secondary effect of the reduced wind mass loss rates for @xmath167 on the delay times is the smaller expansion of the separation during evolution as a smaller amount of mass is removed from the system .",

    "the behaviour of the population of double compact objects in this model can be understood as follows .",

    "this binding is so strong that most of the binaries experience a merger during the first ce phase in their evolutionary history .",
    "this terminates the evolution of the binary and prevents the formation of a dco .",
    "the least affected are bh - bh systems , since the fixed @xmath1 value used in this variation is comparable to ( although lower than ) the _ nanjing _ @xmath1 ( see fig .  [ lam40],[lam60 ] ) of the typical bh progenitor .    in earlier stages , such as on the hertzsprung gap ,",
    "the values are higher ( _ nanjing _ @xmath180@xmath181 ; see fig .",
    "[ lam40 ] ) .",

    "there are two mechanisms determining this outcome .",
    "the first is the increased number of mergers during the ce in this variation , which reduces the overall number of dcos .",
    "the second is the fact that less massive bh - bh systems have relatively light progenitors .",
    "these binaries have smaller chances of ejecting such a strongly bound ce due to a smaller orbital energy reservoir , and merge in the process .    since the populations in submodels a and b are similar , we find similar distributions of chirp masses and delay times .",

    "as most donors are cheb stars , both submodels produce very similar populations . furthermore , since many progenitors are very massive stars , they produce very massive bh - bh systems in both submodels .    the average delay times for@xmath138 are @xmath190for ns - ns , @xmath191 gyr for bh - ns , and @xmath192 gyr for bh - bh systems . for @xmath139",

    "the increase in merger rates by a factor of @xmath349 , when contrasted with the standard model , is primarily associated with the first occurrence of mass transfer through rlof . in this variation , in the outcome of rlof , the secondary component ( initially less massive ) gains more mass from the primary component ( initially more massive ) as compared with the same event in the standard model . in the latter only half of the donated mass",

    "now , ( in this variation ) many secondary components which normally underwent the rgb phase ( in the standard model ) , skip this evolutionary period .",
    "the additional mass increases the core temperature of the star and allows it to begin helium burning in the core ( cheb star ) immediately after the hg .",

    "the outcome of the ce for a binary with a cheb donor will result in a tighter separation than with an rgb donor . in the latter case , which often occurs in the standard model ,",
    "the binaries undergo an additional mass transfer from the secondary ( see channel nsns01 in table [ channels ] ) after the ce .",
    "the resulting separation is often insufficient to prevent the disruption by the following second sn .",
    "however , if the cheb star is the donor , which is often the case in this variation , ns - ns progenitors will engage in a second ce immediately after the first one , due to the smaller separation .",
    "the outcome of two consecutive ces is an orbit tight enough ( small separation ) to increase the chances of survival of the subsequent second sn . in other words the ns - ns systems that form the merging population in this variation",
    "originate from the population of disrupted systems in the standard model .",
    "a secondary effect of fully conservative mass transfer is that stars with mass that is close to borderline between white dwarf and neutron star often become the latter .",
    "overall more ns - ns are formed relative to white dwarf - neutron star systems in this model . for submodel a the ns - ns rates increase due to the aforementioned evolutionary scenarios with two consecutive ces ( e.g.,nsns03 ) .",

    "submodel b does not allow for the survival of the ce with evolved helium donors .",
    "therefore , the merger rates drop drastically ( from @xmath274 to @xmath263 ) for submodel b in this variation , when contrasted with the standard model .    for @xmath139 , in this variation",
    "the ns - ns systems arrive from a different population of progenitors than the ones in the standard model . in the standard model many progenitors that engage in a stable mass transfer at first contact",
    "do not survive the following first supernova explosion . however , in this variation the fully conservative mass transfer forces the stars to engage in ce upon first contact .",
    "the full mass transfer causes the roche lobe around the donor to shrink rapidly due to the companion becoming more massive and the transfer starts to be unstable .",
    "the reduction of the separation between the components in the ce outcome allows for the survival of the first sn and eventually the formation of a merging dco .",

    ", bh - ns progenitors evolved mostly through a stable mass transfer upon first contact ( see bhns01 , table [ channels ] ) .",
    "however , in this variation the fully conservative mass transfer almost immediately forces the binary into a ce .",
    "the outcome is usually a coalescence of the components and further binary evolution is terminated .",
    "additionally to the above , many binaries that formed bh - ns systems in the standard model now form bh - bh systems .",
    "the fully conservative mass transfer allows the secondary component to accumulate more mass during the first contact .",

    "for @xmath138 the most significant difference occurs for bh - ns systems .",
    "when compared with the standard model the rates increase by an order of magnitude for both submodels .",
    "the reason for this is the character of the mass transfer at first contact in the binary .",
    "the first mass transfer through rlof occurs when the primary component ( initially more massive ) evolves off the main sequence , expands rapidly on the hertzsprung gap and overfills its roche lobe . in the standard model ( half - conservative character ) the resulting mass transfer is often unstable , leading to a ce event . as the outcome the components are so close to each other that a merger occurs at the first passage of the periastron .",
    "however , in this variation , this first mass transfer is often stable due to its non - conservative character .",
    "the reason is that the roche lobe around the donor will not decrease as rapidly as in the standard model ( where the accretor gains more mass ) .",
    "so in this case the lack of a ce allows for an undisturbed evolution of the binary at this stage , thus yielding more dcos in the end .",
    "the same mechanism acts for @xmath139 and increases the galactic merger rates by a factor of @xmath29 in this variation when compared with the standard model .",
    "the ns - ns systems experience a drop in galactic merger rates by a factor of @xmath218 for both submodels .",
    "this is caused by a simple fact that in a non - conservative mass transfer the accretor does not gain any mass from the donor .",
    "the most significant stable rlof event ( in terms of the amount of mass flow ) is the one at first contact , where the primary component is the donor .",
    "if the secondary component is deprived of mass at this point , then it can not grow enough to become a ns progenitor and produces a white dwarf remnant instead .",
    "in other words this variation yields ns - wd more often when contrasted with the standard model . for @xmath139",
    "this mechanism is still present however , it is somewhat suppressed by the low wind mass loss caused by the low metallicity composition of the stars . in effect",

    "experience a similar effect as the aforementioned ns - ns systems . at first contact",
    "the secondary component does not gain any mass ( non - conservative mass transfer ) and is more likely to become a ns instead of a bh .",
    "therefore there are more bh - ns systems created at the cost of bh - bh systems",
    ". additionally , secondary stars that make bhs are lighter than in the standard model .",
    "light bhs receive high natal kicks and are subject to disruption .",
    "both effects cause a slight decrease in galactic merger rates for @xmath138 in both submodels .    for",
    "@xmath139 bh - bh systems experience the same effects resulting from the secondary component gaining no mass at first contact .",
    "this produces bh - ns binaries ( instead of bh - bh binaries in standard model ) and makes stars smaller . additionally ,",
    "as compared to models with solar metallicity , expansion of stars is slower for @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , secondaries typically initiate ce late on the cheb",
    ". typical values of @xmath1 for bh progenitors at cheb are lower ( higher binding energy ) than for hg stages ( see fig .",

    "another major difference is in the physics describing sn explosion and the mass of the remnant : startrack utilizes the most recent supernovae calculations @xcite , while seba utilizes the theoretical predictions by @xcite .",

    "it seems then , that although seba predicts smaller bh - bh rates , the employed in seba input physics makes bhs more massive then in startrack .",
    "it seems quite possible that these both effects cancel out and the resulting ligo / virgo detection rates will come out very similar at least if compared with our unphysical models .",
    "we have investigated the major parameters and input physics involved in binary evolution leading to the formation of double compact objects : the ce coefficient @xmath1 , the supernova mechanisms ( remnant formation and natal kick magnitude ) , the maximum mass of nss , and the wind mass loss rates .",
    "the study was performed by calculating a suite of population synthesis models , allowing us to estimate the associated uncertainties in the formation of dcos .",
    "the calculations were done using the startrack population synthesis code , recently updated with wind mass loss rates for massive stars , a realistic ce treatment , and convection - driven neutrino - enhanced supernovae .",
    "these updates are incorporated in our revised standard model ( see section [ stan ] ) of binary evolution and dco formation .",
    "our newer version yields lower merger rates than the equivalent standard model from  @xcite .",
    "this difference arises mainly from the _ nanjing _ treatment of the ce parameter , @xmath1 ( see section [ newlam ] ; @xcite ) , which we have now incorporated .",
    "significant changes in the merger rates are also caused by varying the value of @xmath1 ( variations 14 , 14 and 15 , see table [ gmerger02 ] and [ gmerger002 ] ) .",
    "we therefore identify a strong dependence of the merger rates on the binding energy of the ce .",
    "emerging from the simulations are two populations of dcos .",
    "the first is that of double compact objects with merger times less than @xmath99 gyr ( merging in a milky way - like galaxy , the _ merging population _ ) .",
    "the second is of objects having merger times higher than this limit ( distant future mergers , the _ non - merging population _ ) .",
    "the @xmath1 parameter shifts dcos between these two populations . on the one hand , lowering @xmath1 increases the ce binding energy , and thus tends to draw the binaries from the non - merging population toward the merging one , as progenitor binaries must lose more orbital energy to unbind the envelope .",
    "this results in a larger number of system in the merging population , and increases the galactic merger rates . on the other hand ,",
    "this also causes progenitors of dcos from the merging population to merge during the ce more often , terminating binary evolution and therefore reducing the number of binary systems , and thus merger rates .",
    "the final outcome is set by the specific value of @xmath1 , and varies from population to population .",
    "for example , a given change in @xmath1 may cause an increase in the merger rate of bh - bh systems while decreasing the rate of ns - ns systems , due to the differing orbital separations of bh - bh and ns - ns progenitors .",
    "the types of dcos most affected by this mechanism are ns - ns and bh - ns systems .",
    "the range of merger rates for these systems spans three orders of magnitude between solar and sub - solar metallicities ( see table [ gmerger02 ] and table [ gmerger002 ] ) .",
    "the large range of merger rates obtained in this and previous studies using calculations with a fixed value of @xmath1 is an artifact of the unphysical treatment of the ce phase .",
    "when a more physically motivated treatment is applied , in which the value of @xmath1 is chosen to correspond to the given star and its evolutionary stage , it is found that the merger rates are on the high side of the ranges computed with variations that assume non - physical , fixed values of @xmath1 . however , despite having a physical description of this parameter , the details of the common envelope event are still elusive .",
    "first , it is not known how and with what efficiency the orbital energy is transferred into the envelope .",
    "second , we lack the full description of the core - envelope boundary .",
    "we have attempted to manipulate the value of @xmath1 to estimate a potential effect of these unknowns on the dco merger rates .",
    "the most significant manifestation of this exercises is a factor of @xmath29@xmath402 reduction in galactic merger rates for systems containing a bh ( see tables [ gmerger02 ] and [ gmerger002 ] ) .",
    "in particular , for the standard model , for either choice of metallicity of submodel ( a or b ) , the bh - bh galactic merger rate is at least @xmath116 per myr .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath221 higher than the `` realistic '' estimate used in @xcite , which translates into a detection rate of @xmath129 bh - bh mergers per year with advanced ligo and virgo detectors in that paper .",
    "therefore , if the standard model is correct , we may expect that advanced gravitational - wave detectors will be able to capture above a hundred bh - bh coalescences per year .",
    "this is a clearly positive prediction from the perspective of the ongoing searches for gravitational - wave signals .",
    "however , we are unable to provide error estimate on this improvement , since there are no alternative physical estimates for @xmath1 readily available to us .",
    "therefore , one should treat this estimate with some caution .",
    "we can test ( similarly to @xcite ) the validity of certain models using the observed limits on the galactic ns - ns merger rate  @xcite .",
    "their upper limit ( @xmath403 myr@xmath52 ) is not violated by any of our models .",
    "however , the lower limit ( @xmath297 myr@xmath52 ) is not met by several of our models , and they would therefore be ruled out .",

    "this points to a conclusion that a rlof event , in which no mass is lost form the system seems unlikely .",
    "all other employ a fixed value of @xmath1 , and the observations of galactic ns - ns systems lends further support to our claim that such a treatment is unphysical .",

    "we test our chirp mass distribution for @xmath139 against the predicted minimal predicted chirp mass for ic10 x1 equal to @xmath5 @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ bmch002var ] and table [ bmch002char ] one can see that models v3submodel b ( max .",
    "chirp mass @xmath406 ) , v4submodel b ( max . chirp mass @xmath407 ) and v14submodel b ( max .",
    "chirp mass @xmath394 ) do not reach this limit .",
    "all of these models use high @xmath1 values ( the former two a constant value ) .",
    "this is further evidence to support the claim that treatment of @xmath1 as a constant value is unphysical .",
    "another influential factor in dco formation is the treatment of sn explosions .",
    "specifically , the magnitude of the natal kick plays a significant role , as the high kicks ( assumed in our standard model ) tend to disrupt dco progenitors , reducing the merger rates .",
    "the rates for reduced ( by half ) kicks are given in model v7 .",
    "the corresponding increase in the rates is rather modest , due to the fact that for ns - ns systems some nss explode as electron capture supernovae and do not receive kicks at all .",
    "bh kicks are already reduced by the amount of fall back and further kick decrease ( coming from reducing @xmath278 in v7 ) does not significantly increase the rates .",
    "however , the effect of kicks becomes significant for bh - bh systems once the assumption on the reduction of kicks by fallback is relaxed .",
    "we have allowed for the very wide range of possible bh kicks in models v8 ( high kicks ) and v9 ( no kicks ) .",
    "it is found that the galactic merger rates of bh - bh systems change by @xmath218@xmath297 orders of magnitude ( see table [ gmerger02 ] , [ gmerger002 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the mostly unknown magnitude of bh natal kick limits our predictive power for the bh - bh rate estimates .    despite the fact that we lack strong observational or theoretical constraints on bh natal kicks , in our standard model",
    "we have adopted the most likely model of natal kicks ( ones that decrease with increasing bh mass ) .",
    "this model is supported by existing observations ( most massive bhs seem to form without a kick ) and can be intuitively understood in the framework of natal kicks arising from asymmetric supernova mass ejection . the standard model bh - bh merger rates are close to upper limit set by the full allowed range of possibilities ( v8v9 ) , and again it appears that our more realistic treatment of dco formation favors higher rates , and sets an optimistic tone for near - future gravitational wave inspiral detection .",
    "we find that the fully conservative mass transfer scenario ( variation 12 ) for the pessimistic submodel b for @xmath138 generates galactic ns - ns merger rates below the empirically predicted @xmath297 myr@xmath52 for the milky way @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the assumption of fully conservative mass transfer is most likely unphysical .",
    "this is the first in a series of three papers .",
    "results presented here , and their extensions in the synthetic universe on - line database ( www.syntheticuniverse.org ) , will be used in the second study , where we will investigate the ns - ns / bh - ns / bh - bh merger rates as a function of cosmological redshift , star formation rate , and metallicity .",
    "the third paper will focus on gravitational wave detection rates for upcoming observatories ( advanced ligo / virgo and einstein telescope ) .",
