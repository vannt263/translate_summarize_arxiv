    "similar behavior of the conductance takes place in the so - called andreev interferometers ( see experimental observations in refs .   and theoretical explanations in refs .  ) .",
    "the andreev reflection implies that an electron moving in the normal metal towards the superconductor is converted at the s / n  interface into a hole with opposite spin which moves back along the same trajectory .",
    "physically , this process means that an electron with momentum  @xmath24 and spin  @xmath25 moving from the n - metal penetrates the superconductor  s and forms there a cooper pair , i.e. , it pulls another electron with opposite momentum  @xmath26 and spin  @xmath27 .",

    "one can expect a similar behavior of the conductance in s@xmath2/n / n  contacts , where a `` magnetic '' superconductor with a spin filter s@xmath2 ( see below ) supplies only fully polarized triplet cooper pairs penetrating the n - metal .",
    "it consists of an s / f  bilayer and a spin filter  fl which passes electrons with only one spin direction , so that one deals with the s@xmath2 superconductor constructed as a multylayer structure of the type s / f / fl . in this case , the conventional ar at the s@xmath2/n  interface is forbidden and , therefore , the subgap conductance at low temperatures as well as the excess current may disappear .",
    "as will be shown in this work , the subgap conductance as well as the excess current  @xmath5 remain finite in s@xmath2/n / n  contacts .",
    "the magnitude of the current  @xmath5 and its sign depend on the value of the exchange field in the ferromagnet  f. in the considered case of s@xmath2/n / n  contacts , the subgap conductance and the excess current occur due to an unconventional ar in which two electrons with parallel spins in the n - film form a triplet cooper pair with the same direction of the total spin .",
    "therefore , the ar at the s@xmath2/n interface is not accompanied by spin - flip ( the hole in the n - wire has the same spin direction as the incident electron ) .",
    "note that , nowadays , the interest in studies of the excess current is revived in the light of recent measurements on s / sm / s  jjs with unconventional semiconductor  sm ( topological insulator ) in which the josephson effect can occur due to majorana modes ( see recent experimental papers refs .  , and references therein ) . in these junctions ,",

    "in the first type of contacts , s@xmath33/n / n , the `` magnetic '' superconductor s@xmath33 is a singlet superconductor  s covered by a thin ferromagnetic layer [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : system1a ]  ( a ) ] . in this case , both the singlet and the triplet cooper pairs penetrate into the n - wire . in the second type of contacts , s@xmath2/n / n , the magnetic superconductor  s@xmath2 consists again of an s / f  bilayer which is separated from the n - wire by a spin filter  fl [ see fig .",

    "the spin filter  fl is assumed to pass only electrons with spins oriented along the @xmath34  axis ( @xmath35 ) . using the quasiclassical theory ,",
    "we show that in both types of contacts , s@xmath33/n / n and s@xmath2/n / n , the conductance  @xmath36 is affected by the proximity effect and the excess ( deficit ) current  @xmath5 ( @xmath18 ) as well as the subgap conductance are finite .",
    "we consider an s@xmath2/n / n contact , in which the `` magnetic '' superconductors are formed by a bcs superconductor  s ( s - wave , singlet ) covered by a thin ferromagnetic layer  f with an exchange field  @xmath37 [ see fig .",

    "thus , the s / f  bilayer with a sufficiently transparent interface can be considered as a `` magnetic '' superconductor with a built - in effective exchange field  @xmath41 which has a nonzero projection onto the @xmath34  axis and an effective energy gap  @xmath42 ( to be more exact , the condensate wave functions in the f  film are analogous to those in a `` magnetic '' superconductor ) .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath43 and @xmath42 are determined by certain conditions .",
