    "the results show that , although the usual qualitative picture of consecutive two - level transitions holds , the transition probabilities deviate significantly from the predictions of the landau - zener - stckelberg@xcite ( lzs ) model .",
    "this deviation is closely related to the multilevel nature of the problem : examples are given where the single relevant parameter of the lzs model ( which is essentially the level splitting in appropriate units ) is the same , but the transition probabilities are different due to the different time dependence of the adiabatic energy levels . an efficient approximation method based on non - lzs two - level transitions",
