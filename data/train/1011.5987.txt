    "in recent years , the demand of wireless communication channel has grown tremendously",
    ". it may be not sufficient to support the large amount of data over a bandwidth - limited time - varying fading channel using fixed modulation and coding .",
    "the fixed modulation and coding schemes with power control are designed to maintain certain quality of service ( qos ) when the channel condition is poor .",
    "thus , fixed modulation and coding scheme does not fully exploit the time - varying nature of the channel .",
    "adaptive modulation and coding ( amc ) , on the other hand , takes advantage of the time - varying characteristic to achieve high spectral efficiency while maintaining acceptable bit error rate ( ber ) .",
    "the notion of adaptive transmission has been proposed striving to satisfy growing consumer demands @xcite . moreover ,",
    "some adaptive transmission techniques have been widely included in wireless standards such as ieee 802.16@xcite , ieee 802.22 @xcite , and lte @xcite .",
    "several pioneer works on amc have been proposed in the literature . in @xcite and @xcite , various rate and power adaptation is considered .",
    "goldsmith et .",
    "@xcite proposes a variable - power variable - rate modulation scheme .",
    "the transmitter switches settings according to the channel state information ( csi ) feedback by the receiver .",
    "the transmitter compares the received channel gain to a set of prescribed thresholds .",
    "the thresholds partition the channel gain into a set of regions corresponding to different adaptation settings , and the transmitter makes decision accordingly .",
    "once a setting has been determined , the setting is unchanged for a transmission frame .",
    "the settings in @xcite and @xcite are restricted to variable - rate while the power is kept constant . in @xcite ,",
    "a frame consists of a variable number of packets depending on the current channel state .",
    "the settings of @xcite are switched at the start of transmission of each frame .",
    "all of these works require current channel state information at the receiver , thus a reliable feedback path is required for the csi feedback .",
    "moreover , the receiver is obliged to feedback the csi every frame .    however , in some circumstances , it is prohibitive to maintain a high feedback rate .",
    "for the systems where power is a concern , such as sensor networks @xcite , frequently csi feedback is not available .",
    "moreover , the research on adaptive transmission technique combined with multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) or orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) or both of them has already received more and more attention .",
    "the adaptive ofdm system @xcite involves optimizing the modulation level and transmission power over the entire frequency band , so the csi is required for all subcarriers resulting in high feedback load . in mimo systems @xcite , the multiple antennas lead to the increasing complexity of csi . as a result",
    ", the csi has higher dimension and is more complex in these systems than that in the single carrier case , and there have been efforts on the reduction of feedback load in these system .    therefore , the further reduction of feedback overhead is desired .",
    "one approach is to reduce the frequency of csi feedback from every frame to every @xmath0 frames .",
    "the adaptation period of the system is also reduced to every @xmath0 frames . however , in the previous works , adaptive transmission makes decision based on current channel state @xcite , or the most probable channel state estimated by ack / nak signal @xcite . if the adaptation period is reduced to every @xmath0 frames , the number of the csi received at the transmitter side decreases . without the knowledge of channel variation between intervals of csi feedback , the adaptive method is chosen only to maximize the throughput of the first frame of the @xmath0 frames instead of the throughput of all subsequent @xmath0 frames .",
    "consequently , the performance of such system is poorer than the system with shorter adaptation period .    in order to maximize the overall throughput",
    ", it is required to take the channel state of subsequent @xmath1 frames into consideration .",
    "thus , some predictions on the channel state of subsequent @xmath1 frames are to be made .",
    "currently there are several channel prediction method such as linear prediction @xcite , channel variation prediction based on finite state markov chain ( fsmc ) @xcite , etc .",
    "however , in the work @xcite , only the channel state prediction of the next frame is considered .",
    "the settings are selected to maximize certain criteria of only the transmission of the next frame .",
    "their results could not extend the adaptation period to @xmath0 frames .",
    "the previous works on channel prediction does not provide the analysis of ber or fer over long variation of channel . in this paper ,",
    "a markov chain - based channel prediction method is proposed .",
    "we are able to predict the channel variation of the following @xmath1 frames through the first frame and derive the close - form expression of the frame error probability of subsequent @xmath1 frames .",
    "hence the channel variation of subsequent @xmath1 frames are taken into consideration , which enables the optimization the overall throughput of the @xmath0 frames .",
    "on the basis of channel prediction based on fsmc , we propose a novel adaptation algorithm : prediction - based adaptation ( prada ) algorithm for modulation and coding .",
    "the proposed algorithm is able to extend the adaptation period from every frame to every @xmath0 frames while still maintaining good performance .",
    "the numerical result shows that with channel prediction , the throughput of system using prada increases significantly over the system that only maximizes the throughput of the first frame .",
    "the systems proposed by the previous works @xcite switch settings based on the received channel gain .",
    "there are also works proposing to utilize solely ack and nak feedback @xcite .",
    "another approach does not assume the channel condition but simply use ack and nak as setting switching criterion @xcite .",
    "the transmitter first selects the largest constellation which has the highest data rate and the highest error probability , and reduces the constellation size once receives retransmission request .",
    "the another approach uses ack and nak as an observation to estimate the underlying channel state @xcite . in @xcite the transmitter forms a belief state space using underlying fsmc model .",
    "the transmitter determines the most possible state according to the received acks or naks , and switches settings accordingly . on the other hand , in the algorithm proposed by vucetic @xcite ,",
    "the transmitter compares the block errors to the specified thresholds to estimate the current channel state .",
    "these thresholds are determined by minimizing the errorneous channel estimation .",
    "both algorithms adopted the fec codes of different rates correspond to the estimated channel state .    in this paper",
    ", we develop another adaptation algorithm prada - b which combines both feedback - reduced csi and ack / nak signal , while the precedent works use either csi or ack / nak only .",
    "the transmitter compares the number of frame errors in @xmath0 frames to the thresholds which are computed by the csi feedback every @xmath2 frames .",
    "the thresholds are determined with the view to maximize the overall throughput over consecutive @xmath2 frames , instead of optimization on the current frame .",
    "switching settings according to fer can further reduce the csi feedback while maintaining acceptable throughput .",
    "the receiver feeds back the csi to the transmitter at the beginning of every @xmath2 frames in order to track the channel behavior .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system and channel model is given in section ii .",
    "the adaptation algorithm of prada is given in section iii .",
    "we develop the mathematical basis of the algorithm , the frame error rate derivation and the threshold of setting switching in section iv .",
    "the numerical results of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated in section v. finally , we draw concluding remarks in section vi .",
    "the system model considered in this work is given in figure [ fig_system_model ] .",
    "the information bits are encoded by the rate - compatible punctured convolutional ( rcpc ) code , modulated , then transmitted .",
    "the transmitter switches the modulation and the coding every setting adaptation period .",
    "the setting adaptation period is @xmath0 frame periods .    in this model ,",
    "@xmath3 settings are chosen from the combinations of modulations and rcpc codes .",
    "denote @xmath3 settings as @xmath4 , listed in the descending order of the spectral efficiency , which has the same meaning as listing the settings in the descending order of fer in this system .",
    "the fer is computed based on the same number of modulation symbols .",
    "each setting corresponds to a data rate , which combines the effect of the modulation and the coding .",
    "denote the data rate of each setting as @xmath5 .",
    "note that @xmath6 because the setting with higher data rate also has higher fer .",
    "the receiver sends an ack or a nak to the transmitter when it receives a frame .",
    "in addition , the receiver sends the csi to the transmitter at certain frequency .",
    "the transmitter switches the setting according to the csi and the fer .",
    "the algorithms are described in section [ adaptation ] .",
    "fsmc is widely used to model rayleigh fading channel which is a good approximation of channel with memory . and in the application of packet / frame transmission ,",
    "first - order markov chain s accuracy is supported by @xcite .",
    "there are some studies on how to partition snr into finite states of fsmc model .",
    "wang and moayeri @xcite propose a method partitioning all fsmc states that have the same stationary probability .",
    "zang and kassam @xcite propose a method partitioning all fsmc states that have the same average time duration .",
    "park and hwang @xcite propose a method partitioning fsmc states such that the non - adjacent transition probabilities are small enough . in this work",
    ", we adopt the channel model proposed in @xcite which is a better approximation and the average time duration is made large enough to meet our assumption that in each frame transmission the state will not change .",
    "the channel snr @xmath7 is quantized into several non - overlapping states with boundary values @xmath8 $ ] with @xmath9 = 0 and @xmath10 .",
    "the channel is said to be in state @xmath11 if @xmath12 .",
    "thus we can obtain stationary probability @xmath13 of @xmath11 using the probability density function of rayleigh fading channel .",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath15 is the average snr .    in this system ,",
    "we assume constant time in each frame transition , denoted by @xmath16 . we can obtain the transition probabilities @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the level crossing rate at snr level @xmath19 either in the positive direction or in the negative direction , given by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the maximum doppler frequency due to the user motion .",
    "given the channel model , we can analyze the performance of the system .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the fer of the channel snr @xmath7 when using setting @xmath23 .",
    "the fer of the channel state @xmath11 when using setting @xmath23 , which is denoted by @xmath24 , can be derived as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the probability that channel snr is @xmath7 .    in this work ,",
    "the fer is obtained by computer simulation using rcpc codes .",
    "the modulation and the puncturing rate are corresponding to the setting @xmath23 .",
    "however , the expression can also be computed using analytical expression or simulation - fitting expression of @xmath22 .",
    "in this section , we describe the proposed algorithms , that is , prada - a and prada - b .",
    "prada - b considers the csi feedback and the fer in previous transmissions . in order to choose the optimal setting",
    ", it requires a threshold table for fer comparison .",
    "although the computation can be done offline , the complexity may be not allowed in some system . prada - a",
    "is also proposed because it reduces the computational complexity of prada - b .",
    "prada - a considers only the csi feedback and its computation is only the first part of prada - b s computation .    by simulation",
    ", we can get the fer of each setting in each state .",
    "the expected throughput of successive @xmath0 frames given the first channel state and the setting can be derived if the fer and the channel transition probability are known .",
    "it is used in both prada - a and prada - b .",
    "the derivation of the expected throughput is given in section [ derive_throughput ] .    to deal with the doppler frequency variation , the algorithms use different fsmc channels .",
    "that is , we can generate several fsmc channels for possible doppler frequency and use them in algorithm computation .",
    "figure [ fig_prada_a ] illustrates the time domain diagram of prada - a .",
    "we call @xmath0 frame transmission duration a setting adaptation period . at the beginning of a setting adaptation period ,",
    "the transmitter chooses the setting maximizing the throughput of the next @xmath0 frames according to the current channel state . here",
    "we summarize the steps as follows :    * step 1 : for every setting , compute the expected throughput of the next @xmath0 frame transmissions for every possible beginning channel state .",
    "this can be done offline .",
    "* step 2 : at the beginning of a setting adaptation period , the transmitter observes the channel state and chooses the corresponding setting . *",
    "step 3 : repeat 2 .",
    "since the fer in the previous setting adaptation period implies the wireless channel condition implicitly , we propose a fer - based algorithms .",
    "the time domain diagram of this algorithm is shown in figure [ fig_prada_b ] .",
    "a threshold adaptation period is @xmath27 setting adaptation periods . at the end of a setting adaptation period ,",
    "the transmitter compares the fer to some predetermined threshold to decide which setting to used in next setting adaptation period . at the beginning of a threshold adaptation period",
    ", the transmitter decide the threshold used in the next @xmath27 setting adaptation periods .",
    "the detail of the threshold determination is given in section [ derivation ] .",
    "the adaptation consists of two parts , one is the adaptive modulation and coding switching , and the other is the threshold adaptation .",
    "the former is for the short - term channel variation while the latter is for the long - term channel variation .",
    "the transmitter computes the fer in the previous setting adaptation period first , and then compare the fer to the threshold . a threshold",
    "set consists of @xmath28 values @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "if the fer is lower than @xmath32 when using setting @xmath23 , the transmitter switches to setting @xmath33 ; if the fer is higher than @xmath34 when using setting @xmath23 , the transmitter switches to setting @xmath35 ; otherwise , the transmitter uses the same setting as before . at the beginning ,",
    "the system can start with any setting because it would switches to the optimal setting later .",
    "the steps are summarized as follows :    * step 1 : initiate the transmitter using setting @xmath36 .",
    "* step 2 : in each setting adaptation period , record number of erroneous frames @xmath37 , and the fer @xmath38 . *",
    "step 3:if the fer is lower than @xmath32 , switch to setting @xmath33 ; else if the fer is higher than @xmath34 , switch to setting @xmath35 ; else the setting remains the same .",
    "due to the large - scale fading of wireless channel , the transmitter changes the thresholds every @xmath27 setting adaptation periods ( i.e. , @xmath2 frame transmissions ) .",
    "the thresholds are chosen to maximize the expected throughput of the next @xmath2 frame transmissions .",
    "the transmitter changes the thresholds at the beginning of the @xmath2 frame transmissions based on the channel state @xmath11 and the current setting @xmath23 .",
    "the detail of computing the thresholds is given in section [ derivation ]    here we summarize the steps as follows :    * step 1 : for each possible combination \\{@xmath39 } , find the corresponding threshold set .",
    "this can be done offline .",
    "* step 2 : at the beginning , use the threshold set corresponding to \\{@xmath40 } for the first @xmath2 frame transmissions , where @xmath11 is the channel state at the beginning .",
    "* step 3 : after @xmath27 setting adaptation periods , the system changes the threshold set according to the first state \\{@xmath39 } of the next @xmath27 setting adaptation period . * step 4 : repeat 3 .",
    "in this section , we describe the analysis of the prada algorithm .",
    "since prada - a is a simplified version of prada - b , it only related to section [ derive_throughput ] .",
