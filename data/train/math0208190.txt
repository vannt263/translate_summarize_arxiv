    "in this  we investigate flows on discrete curves in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . by a discrete curve @xmath3 in @xmath4",
    "we mean a map @xmath5 .",
    "a flow on @xmath3 is a smooth variation of @xmath3 .",
    "the description of these curves is mainly motivated by the picture of discrete curves in @xmath1 , in other words we imagine curves in @xmath0 as curves in @xmath1 , which are lifted to homogeneous coordinates ; and curves in @xmath2 , as curves in @xmath1 , which do not hit infinity . in particular",
    "this view allows us to find a novel interpretation of the wellknown one dimensional toda lattice hierarchy in terms of flows on discrete curves .",
    "the toda lattice hierarchy is a set of equations , including the toda equation : @xmath6 the toda equation is sometimes also called first flow equation of the toda lattice hierarchy , it was discovered by toda in 1967 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a good overview about the vast literature about the toda lattice can be found in ( @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section",
    "[ sec : dc : definitions ] we define discrete curves in @xmath0 and @xmath7 a discrete analog of the schwartzian derivative in terms of cross - ratios of four neighboring points will be defined . a zero curvature or lax representation for flows on that discrete curves will be given .    in section [ sec : dc : arclength ] we will restrict ourselves to the case of so - called discrete ( conformal ) arc length parametrized curves . in [ subsec : dc : arclengthc2 ] we define certain flows on arc length parametrized curves which in the turn induce flows for the cross - ratios of that curve .",
    "it will be shown that for these flows the cross - ratios give solutions to equations of the volterra hierarchy .    in [ subsec",
    ": dc : discreteeuclidean ] the arc length parametrized curves in @xmath0 viewed as curves in @xmath1 in homogeneous coordinates will be reduced to curves in @xmath2 , by assuming that the second coordinate does not vanish .",
    "we call this reduction euclidean reduction .",
    "it will be shown that if one starts with a flow on a discrete arc length parametrized curve in @xmath0 , such that the corresponding cross - ratios are solutions to the second flow of the volterra hierarchy , which is also called the discrete kdv flow , then the corresponding curve obtained by euclidean reduction satisfies a discrete version of the mkdv flow .",
    "this gives a discrete version of a geometrical interpretation of the miura transformation .    in [ subsec : dc : discreteflows ] a nice geometrical interpretation of bcklund transformations of arc length parametrized discrete curves in @xmath0",
    "will be given . in the turn a time discrete version of the volterra equation , which is the first flow equation of the volterra hierarchy ,",
    "is derived .    in section  [ sec",
    ": dc : todalattice ] determinants of two and three neighboring points of a discrete curve in @xmath0 will be identified with the flaschka - manakov variables of the toda lattice .",
    "the toda flows define flow directions for curves in @xmath8    in [ sec : dc : threeflowsred ] the flows on the discrete curves in @xmath0 given by toda lattice hierarchy will be further investigated .",
    "in particular in [ subsec : dc : threeflows ] the flows corresponding to the  first  three flows will be given explicitly .",
    "in [ sec : dc : invariant ] we derive several geometrical features of these flows .",
    "in particular in [ subsec : dc : ellipse ] we will look at flows on curves which are compatible with the known reduction @xcite of the toda lattice hierarchy to the volterra lattice hierarchy by setting the flaschka - manakov variable @xmath9 this reduction is different from from the reduction in [ subsec : dc : arclengthc2 ] , where among others @xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless the cross ratios of such curves evolve again with equations of the volterra hierachy .",
    "hence there exist two geometrically motivated reductions of the toda lattice hierachy to the volterra hierarchy .",
    "the case @xmath11 and @xmath12 lies in the intersection of both reductions , it belongs to the trivial solutions of the toda lattice hierachy equations . the corresponding class of curves , which are invariant under this trivial flow are quadrics , as will be shown in that subsection .    in the subsection  [ sec : dc : elastica ] we will again look for a class of curves , which is invariant ( up to euclidian motion and tangential flow ) under a certain toda flow .",
    "this time we find that in the euclidian reduction socalled discrete planar elastic curves are invariant under the discrete mkdv flow .",
    "let @xmath13 , @xmath14 be a discrete curve in the complex projective space .",
    "we assume @xmath15 is immersed , i.e. @xmath16 and @xmath17 are pairwise disjoined . by introducing homogeneous coordinates ,",
    "we can lift @xmath15 to a map    : & & ^2 + k & & _ k = ( x_k + y_k ) [ def : dc : gamdef]with @xmath18 .",
    "obviously @xmath3 is not uniquely defined : for @xmath19 , @xmath20 is also a valid lift .",
    "define : g_k & = & ( _ k,_k+1 ) = x_k y_k+1-y_k x_k+1 + u_k&=&(_k-1,_k+1 ) [ def : dc : gu ] the following lemma can be straightforwardly obtained by using the above definitions ( [ def : dc : gu ] ) :    @xmath21 [ lem : dc : curvesteps ]    if the variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 and initial points @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given , then lemma  [ lem : dc : gam1 ] is a recursive definition of a discrete curve .",
    "this may look as an odd way to define a discrete curve ; nevertheless later on the power of this definition will become more apparent .",
    "in particular the variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 will be related to the flaschka - manakov @xcite variables of the one dimensional toda lattice .",
    "note that after choosing an initial @xmath24 it is always possible ( c is immersed ) to find @xmath26 such that : g_k = 1 [ def : dc : deteins ] for all @xmath27 .",
    "we will call discrete curves @xmath28 with property ( [ def : dc : deteins ] ) conformal arc length parametrized . hence the variables @xmath23 measure the deviation from arc length parameterization .",
    "the _ cross - ratio _ of four points @xmath29 is defined by @xmath30    let us denote the cross - ratio of four neighboring points of @xmath3 by @xmath31 : @xmath32    now @xmath33 .",
    "this means that @xmath26 and @xmath34 are linearly independent .",
    "hence an arbitrary flow on ( or variation of ) @xmath3 can be written in the following way : @xmath35 the variables @xmath36 are arbitrary , for convenience we sometimes use the normalized variable : _ k = _ k ( g_k+1+g_k-1 ) .",
