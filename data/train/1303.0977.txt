    "in the hard x - ray ( hxr ) emission of many flares quasi - periodic variations were observed (; see also the review of and references therein ) .    in our previous papers ( ( paper i ) , @xcite ( paper ii ) ) we investigated flares with periods @xmath0  s , but in paper i we have found three flares with periods @xmath1",
    "s. they turned out to be large arcade flares .",
    "investigation of the quasi - periodic oscillations in such large flares is very important , since their large sizes allow us to investigate the structure of the oscillation volume more comprehensively .",
    "unfortunately , appropriate observations of the x - ray oscillations in such large flares are very rare . in the present paper",
    "we investigate an interesting example of such a large flare of 2 november 1991 .",
    "section  [ obs ] contains the analysis of observations and sections [ disc ] and [ sum ] present discussion and summary .        in figure  [ sep30 ]",
    "we reproduce the x - ray image of the large flare of 30 september 1998 ( see paper i ) , since it will be helpful in our analysis of the 2 november 1991 flare . in the colour sxr image a long arcade channel",
    "is seen . in the hxr image ( isocontours ) a triangular ( `` cusp '' ) structure is seen above the arcade channel .",
    "the strong hxr sources , b and c , occur at the places where the cusp structure contacts with the arcade channel .",
    "this suggests that there is magnetic connection between the cusp and the channel at b and c , which allows the electrons accelerated in the cusp to penetrate into the dense plasma of the channel and to generate the enhanced hxr emission there .",
    "in the present paper we investigate a large arcade flare which occurred at the western limb on 2 november 1991 ( see x - ray images in figures [ hxt1][sxt ] and [ hxt3][hxt4 ] ) .",
    "it was a long duration event ( lde ) of goes class m4.8 .",
    "the soft x - ray emission had begun to rise at 15:32 ut and it reached its maximum at about 17:00 ut ( see the goes light curves in figure  [ goes ] ) , _ i.e. _ it was of `` slow - lde '' type according to .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission began at the northern footpoint of the flaring loop at 16:19 ut and it was seen up to 18:10 ut ( see _ solar - geophysical data _ no .",
    "573/ii ) .        the hard x - ray light curves , recorded by the _",
    "yohkoh _ hard x - ray telescope , hxt @xcite and the _ compton gamma ray observatory burst and transient source experiment _ , batse @xcite , are shown in figures [ lc - hxt ] and [ batse]a .",
    "the nominal energy range of the batse observations is @xmath3  kev .",
    "the comparison of the light curves in figures [ lc - hxt ] and [ batse ] shows that the strong peak at about 16:34 ut is more dominant in the batse observations than in the _ yohkoh _ 23 - 33  kev energy range .",
    "we have compared the ratio of the amplitude of the strong peak and of the weak peaks ( 16:2116:30 ut ) in these sequences and we have found that the batse ratio is in good agreement with the _ yohkoh _ 33 - 53  kev ratio , which indicates that the actual energy range of the batse observations was @xmath4  kev .",
    "[ see equation ( 1)].,scaledwidth=100.0% ]      to separate the hxr pulses from the smooth hxr rise we have calculated the normalized time series @xmath5(see paper ii ) .",
    "@xmath6 where @xmath7 is the measured hxr flux and @xmath8 is the running average of @xmath7 .",
    "the red curve in figure [ batse]a shows @xmath8 calculated with averaging time @xmath9s .",
    "the normalized time series , @xmath5 , is shown in figure [ batse]b . our basic method to recognize quasi - periodic sequences",
    "is the following .",
    "we measure time - intervals , @xmath10 , between successive hxr peaks and calculate the period , @xmath11 , and its standard ( r.m.s . ) deviation , @xmath12 .",
    "our criterion of a quasi - periodicity is @xmath13 .",
    "the values of @xmath14 and @xmath12 for different parts of the impulsive phase of the investigated flare are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    ".parameters of the quasi - periodic oscillations of the 2 november 1991 flare [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath15 is the trap ratio at the maximum of compression .",
    "@xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the number ( s@xmath18 ) of escaping electrons , + @xmath19 is the number ( s@xmath18 ) of electrons which emit photons and + are thermalized before they escape .",
    "figure  [ hxt2 ] in connection with table  [ tab2 ] indicates that during the sequence of pulses , 16:20 - 16:29 ut , the values of @xmath15 for the 25 kev electrons were @xmath20 ( weak precipitation of the electrons ) and after 16:31 ut they were @xmath21 ( strong precipitation ) .",
    "this shows that the dramatic change in the precipitation can be caused by a moderate change in the value of @xmath15 .    according to our model of oscillating magnetic traps the decrease in the value of @xmath15 in the sequence of pulses ( _",
    "i.e. _ increase in the maximum compression ) is due to the increase in the amplitude of the magnetic trap oscillation .",
    "the amplitude gradually increases due to the feedback with the pulses of the pressure of accelerated ( non - thermal ) electrons .",
    "when the precipitation of 25 kev electrons began to be strong ( after 16:31 ut ) , the strong footpoint source f was seen in the m1 images ( figure  [ hxt2 ] ) .",
    "this shows that strong chromospheric evaporation began then .",
    "the dense plasma reached the loop - top about 16:32 ut which caused i ) the strong sxr emission seen as the saturation in the sxr images ( figure  [ hxt3 ] ) and ii ) the strong hxr peak at about 16:34 ut ( figure  [ batse]a ) which is due to the increase in the density in the oscillating magnetic traps .",
    "figure  [ hxt3]b shows that strong precipitation of 25 kev electrons toward the footpoint f continued during the hxr maximum .",
    "further increase in the density inside the traps ( @xmath22  @xmath23 ) caused damping of electron acceleration when the collisional energy loss time , @xmath24 , became similar to the acceleration time , @xmath25 .",
    "this is seen as the quick decrease in hxr emission after 16:36 ut ( figure  [ batse]a ) .",
    "another important feature of the flare investigated is the strong asymmetry in electron precipitation ( source b was much stronger than source c , and the northern footpoint source f dominated over southern footpoint ) .",
    "this asymmetry is the result of inclination of the cusp structure toward north ( see figure  [ hxt2]c ) .",
    "therefore the oscillations of the traps were asymmetric : the compression near the b source was stronger ( @xmath26 lower ) than near the c source and hence the precipitation from b was much stronger than from c.    next property seen in the x - ray images ( figures [ hxt2 ] and [ hxt3]-[hxt4 ] ) is that after 16:31 ut the 25 kev electrons ( m1 images ) could easily escape from the bp source , but the precipitation of 15 kev electrons ( l images ) remained low .",
    "this indicates that in the ensemble of the traps which generated the accelerated electrons , traps had different values of @xmath15 .",
    "the comparison between the l and m1 images ( figures [ hxt2 ] and [ hxt3]-[hxt4 ] ) also shows that the bp source was systematically larger in the l images than in the m1 images .",
    "this shows that the traps which generated the 15 kev electrons occupied a larger volume in the bp source than the traps which generated the 25 kev electrons .",
    ", of the hxr loop - top source and the period , @xmath14 , obtained in paper i. the regression line has been calculated for smaller flares ( @xmath27  s ) .",
    "the thick red cross shows the position of the flare investigated in the present paper.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in paper i we investigated the relationship between the period and the size of the hxr loop - top sources .",
    "figure  [ plot ] shows the obtained correlation diagram . in that paper",
    "we described the size of the bpc cusp in large flares with a parameter @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the height of the triangle bpc .",
    "therefore for the present flare we have measured the value @xmath30 mm ( figure  [ hxt2]c ) and plotted the point ( @xmath14 , @xmath28 ) as the thick red cross in figure  [ plot ] .",
    "it may be rather surprising that in figure  [ plot ] the points corresponding to the large ( @xmath1  s ) and small ( @xmath27  s ) flares are located near the same regression line .",
    "this can be easily explained in terms of the model of oscillating magnetic traps .",
    "a.   in paper i we have obtained the following estimate : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the alfv@xmath33n speed in the magnetic traps .",
    "b.   in paper i we have also found that during the impulsive phase the plasma pressure , @xmath34 , inside the traps reaches values which are of the order of the magnetic pressure @xmath35 ( see section  3 in paper i ) .",
    "using the relationships : @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the electron number density , @xmath39 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath40 is the plasma density , we obtain : @xmath41}\\quad\\ ] ] from equations ( 6 ) and ( 10 ) we obtain : @xmath42}\\quad\\ ] ] hence the points corresponding to large and small flares are located near the same regression line because :    a.   the gas pressure , @xmath34 , inside the magnetic traps is proportional to the magnetic pressure [ equation ( 7 ) ] , b.   the temperatures which are reached in these flares are similar [ see equation ( 11 ) ] .",
    "we also wanted to check if equation ( 11 ) provides good approximation of the @xmath43 ratio .",
    "therefore we have estimated the temperature , @xmath44 , and the electron number density , @xmath38 , in the bp source from the sxr images which have been recorded with the be119 and al.1 filters .",
    "this diagnostics was only possible for the time interval 16:20 - 16:30 ut , since later images were seriously saturated ( see figure  [ hxt3 ] ) . using the filter ratio method we have found that the temperature slowly increased from 11 to 12 mk and the electron number density was about @xmath45  @xmath23 during this time interval .",
    ", derived from the goes observations.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    it has been shown @xcite that the temperature , @xmath46 , estimated from the standard goes records , adequately represents the temperature of the hot plasma which generates the investigated sxr emission .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath46 are shown in figure  [ tgoes ] .",
    "we see that during the impulsive phase the temperature reached 12 mk which confirms that the flare was not very hot .",
    "this is in agreement with the temperatures @xmath46 obtained for other `` slow - lde '' flares @xcite .",
    "putting the value @xmath47  mk into equation ( 11 ) we obtain @xmath48 mms@xmath18 which is in good agreement with the value obtained from the observations ( figure  [ plot ] ) , @xmath49 mms@xmath18 .",
    "hence equation ( 11 ) adequately describes the investigated flare and it probably provides a good approximation for other flares which are not very hot .",
    "figure  [ sxt ] shows late - phase sxr images of the investigated flare .",
    "these images are very important to confirm the cusp - like magnetic structure of the flare .",
    "a slow rise of the cusp structure is seen with the velocity about 4 kms@xmath18 .",
    "the flare investigated in the present paper is exceptional , because :    a.   it was a large slowly - developing flare located at the solar limb , b.   it showed a clear sequence of quasi - periodic hxr pulses , c.   the available x - ray observations of the flare allowed us to investigate the development of its impulsive phase in some details .      the analysis of the hxr observations has confirmed that i ) quasi - periodic oscillations of the magnetic traps occur in the cusp - like magnetic structure and ii ) the oscillations accelerate the electrons which generate the quasi - periodic hxr pulses .",
    "the analysis of the observations allowed us also to investigate changes in the efficiency of precipitation of accelerated electrons during the impulsive phase .",
    "moreover , we have found that the efficiency of precipitation ( _ i.e. _ @xmath15 ) is different in different traps which participate in the generation of the hxr pulses .",
    "a.   the hxr pulses increase their amplitudes due to the increase in the amplitude of magnetic trap oscillations and the increase in the density within the traps caused by the chromospheric evaporation upflow .",
    "b.   accelerated electrons can precipitate into the arcade channel .",
    "c.   the increase in the amplitude of the hxr pulses terminates when further increase in the density inside the traps inhibits the acceleration of electrons .",
    "generally , the model of oscillating magnetic traps is able to explain all the properties which have been derived from the analysis of the hxr emission in the present paper . in particular",
    ", the model explains : i ) time variation of the electron precipitation seen in the sequences of the hxr images , ii ) strong asymmetry in the precipitation of accelerated electrons , and iii ) systematic differences in the precipitation of 15 and 25 kev electrons revealed by the comparison of the l and m1 images .",
    "all this means that the hxr observations , together with the model of oscillating magnetic traps , give us a consistent picture of the development of the flare impulsive phase .",
