    "electron - positron annihilation to charmonium and an additional hidden - charm state , or a pair of open - charmed mesons  double @xmath0  production  has been known for only five years , but is now an established object of theoretical and experimental study .",
    "the field is still being driven by data .",
    "this presentation surveys current experimental knowledge : after reviewing the history ( section  [ sec : history ] ) and the now - established results on double - charmonium production @xmath5 ( section  [ sec : baseline ] ) , we discuss the latest experimental work , which focusses on states above open - charm threshold ( section  [ sec : cutting ] ) .",
    "some `` loose ends '' , which might reward renewed attention , are also noted ( section  [ sec : sidelines ] ) . in closing ( section  [ sec : summary ] )",
    "we summarize both established and new results , and their relation to theory .",
    "this field grew from studies of inclusive charmonium production @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "an old cleo analysis on a small sample  @xcite had presented evidence for direct decays @xmath7 , distinguished by @xmath8 momenta above the endpoint for @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "using data from early b - factory running@xmath10 on the @xmath11  resonance , and @xmath12 in the continuum @xmath13 below ",
    "belle  @xcite excluded such production , setting a limit @xmath14 at 95% confidence .",
    "more importantly , they established picobarn cross - sections for @xmath15 processes in the continuum , and a peculiar momentum spectrum for the produced @xmath16 : in the @xmath8 sample , the cross - section fell to zero well below the momentum endpoint ( see fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .     in @xmath17 production in early belle data  @xcite .",
    "the curves show a fit to a series of charmonium states ( solid ) over a continuous component ( dashed ) ; the shaded histogram shows the distribution for events in the @xmath8 mass sidebands .",
    "the charmonium lineshapes are broadened by initial state radiation : see the text.,width=302 ]    the @xmath1@xmath2  initial state being known , a simple rescaling of the @xmath8 momentum gives the mass of the system recoiling against it in the final state : @xmath18 an upper bound on momentum thus corresponds to a _ lower bound _ on the mass of the recoiling system . studied in this way  @xcite , the surprising conclusion ( fig .  [",
    "fig : psiccbar - belle ] ) was that the interaction @xmath17 does not proceed if the mass of the recoiling system @xmath19 is below @xmath0  threshold , while immediately above threshold there is significant two - body production , with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "although familiar now , it is worth remembering how completely unexpected this result was at the time .",
    "it was then accepted  @xcite that charmonium production at @xmath23 was dominated by the @xmath24 process , with a momentum spectrum extending to the kinematic endpoint and thus a @xmath25  spectrum to low masses ; @xmath26 was an @xmath27 correction .",
    "an additional contribution from @xmath28 , where the charmonium develops from a colour - octet @xmath0  pair , was expected at momentum endpoint ( low @xmath25 ) .",
    "the contradiction with data led to reexamination of both theoretical and experimental methods .    in the",
    "recoil mass technique , the system @xmath19 is not reconstructed and identification is thus indirect .",
    "alternative explanations of the data have sprung from this limitation , while improvements to the method have focussed on partial reconstruction and constraints .",
    "the original analysis  @xcite already used a mass - vertex constraint in @xmath8 reconstruction , improving @xmath25  resolution by a factor of two .",
    "contributions from qed processes are more troublesome .",
    "initial - state radiation ( isr ) leads to a high-@xmath25  tail ( typically model - dependent ) on the lineshape of any peak ; more than four tracks are required to suppress contributions from other ( low - multiplicity ) qed interactions .",
    "the leading alternative interpretation of the data relied on such a process : @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "while @xmath30 production requires the second state to be even under charge conjugation , @xmath31 , the two - virtual - photon process allows @xmath32 and in particular permits @xmath33 .",
    "as only the @xmath34 signal was statistically significant in the 2002 analysis  @xcite , it was attractive to ascribe the peak ( in part ) to events with a second @xmath8 . a more ambitious ( and essentially mirror - image )",
    "proposal  @xcite was that @xmath35 did in fact dominate charmonium production , with the gluons sometimes coupling to a glueball state close to the @xmath36 mass .",
    "these and other interpretations were effectively ruled out by an updated belle analysis  @xcite , using @xmath37 of data and techniques designed to discriminate between the theoretical options .",
    "three @xmath38 events were fully reconstructed , to be compared with the @xmath39 expected from the inclusive yield .",
    "the recoil mass scale was also calibrated using @xmath40 events and found to have a bias of less than @xmath41 , ruling out confusion between @xmath36 and @xmath8 .",
    "attempts to include @xmath42 components in the recoil mass fit resulted in negative yields , and restrictive upper limits on their contribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : psiccbar - both ] , upper plot ) .",
    "an eventual confirmation by babar  @xcite found comparable results ( lower plot ) .",
    ".coefficients from fits of the function @xmath43 to @xmath8 production ( @xmath44 ) and helicity angle ( @xmath45 ) data at belle  @xcite , for @xmath46 .",
    "see the text for results under the constraint @xmath47 , and the expectation . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath48 enhancement has not previously been reported .",
    "the @xmath49 mass and yield results are consistent with those of the earlier analysis  @xcite , while the width is larger than the published value of @xmath50 : a likelihood function non - parabolic in the width parameter had been noted in that case , with a @xmath51 upper limit at 90% confidence .",
    "the corresponding limit in the new analysis is @xmath52 .",
    "cross - sections for @xmath53 and @xmath54 production ( table  [ tab : x - ddbar - param ] , last row ) are in the 20 femtobarn class , as for all the significant @xmath5 processes seen to date .",
    "the concentration on experimentally fruitful problems  establishing and measuring quasi - two - body processes @xmath5  has led to a relative neglect of inclusive @xmath55 studies .",
    "the 2002 belle analysis  @xcite established the fraction @xmath56 using the following method : reconstruction and mass - constraint of @xmath8 , and then an associated @xmath57-meson ; rejection of contamination from @xmath58 events using momentum requirements ; and a two - dimensional fit to obtain @xmath59 yields ( see fig .  2 of ref .",
    "the cross - section thus obtained is model - dependent , relying on simulated @xmath60 fragmentation by pythia to establish efficiencies .",
    "there has been no published update of this remarkable result .",
    "( model - independent but since - unpublished belle results were presented to the quarkonium working group in 2002 , relying instead on counting of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and all ground - state charmed hadrons under minimal cuts .",
    "resolution was similar , with a lower limit on the @xmath63 fraction of 0.48 at 95% confidence . )",
    "data , showing the combinatorial background ( yellow ) and non-@xmath64 contributions ( blue ) below open - charm threshold .",
    "( adapted from a figure by p.  pakhlov.),width=283 ]    a complementary problem is the nature of @xmath17 production by processes other than @xmath63 .",
    "such production does seem to occur : there is a continuous component in inclusive recoil mass spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : x3940-pakhlov - conf ] ) in excess of background , below the open - charm threshold .",
    "the mystery is why this component  due to the @xmath65 process ?",
    " should obey the @xmath0  threshold .",
    "a problem for experimental study here is the lack of theoretical guidance : predictions for the various @xmath66 processes that so preoccupied the original belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite analyses have been discredited , but new predictive studies have not taken their place .",
    "such work is overdue .",
    "the period of fundamental doubt about double charmonium production is now over .",
    "questions concerning the experimental method have been addressed , and the potential for confusion by @xmath67 or other more exotic processes has been excluded  @xcite . and the fear that some untraceable mistake had been made is effectively dispelled by babar s confirmation  @xcite of the belle results  @xcite .",
    "those results establish that @xmath68 dominates charmonium production in the continuum at @xmath69 , while @xmath70 cross - sections are at the @xmath71 level , with no suppression of radially excited states .",
    "recent work shows that prominent resonant contributions continue above open - charm threshold , with similar cross - sections ; this process is proving fruitful in the search for new hidden - charm states .",
    "the ball now lies in the court of theory .",
    "interpretive work on the new states @xmath49 and @xmath48 is already underway , but a predictive account of @xmath15 amplitudes is still lacking . an advantage of the nrqcd approach is its pretension to universal application : at the tevatron , for example , and the lhc .",
    "we await an accurate account of double - charmonium production in @xmath1@xmath2  annihilation that can also embrace quarkonium production at other facilities ."
