    "the large spirals of the local group , the milky way and andromeda ( m31 ) , are known to have a significant number of faint satellite galaxies ; some of the faintest discovered most recently by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) are by far the most numerous class among these satellites and typically the least luminous . in general",
    ", these objects are gas - poor , spatially diffuse , and exhibit significantly elevated mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath2 ; ) .",
    "the latter implies that the dsphs occupy an important position in the mass spectrum representing the smallest known structures where dark matter dominates .",
    "the dsphs have low mean metallicity , and thus their study can provide a probe of stellar evolution at these low metallicities .",
    "in addition , these objects are of interest because they may have abundance ratios that are different from those of the milky way ( @xcite ) .",
    "a recent study on the sculptor dwarf galaxy reported the detection of five x - ray binaries with l@xmath3 erg  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the number seems to be surprisingly high given the expectations based purely on scaling and integrated properties such as central density , core radius , and velocity dispersion .",
    "however , this number appears to be in agreement with predictions of the model proposed by piro et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , where the discovered x - ray sources are potentially low duty cycle transients . by assuming typical velocities for lmxbs ,",
    "dehnen & king ( 2006 ) used the x - ray data to place a mass limit of @xmath4  m@xmath5 on the amount of dark matter ( dm ) in sculptor required to retain the lmxbs .",
    "in addition , the authors note that there should be an extended halo of qlmxbs which may be observable .",
    "simulation studies , involving tidal stripping , ( read et al .",
    "2006b ) , suggest comparable properties for draco .",
    "+   + located at @xmath6  kpc , draco is a faint , metal - poor ( @xmath7 = -1.8\\pm0.2 $ ]  dex ) dsph with an old ( @xmath8  gyr ) stellar population @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that draco s profile is well fit with a king model @xcite with a core radius of @xmath9 , and a tidal radius of @xmath10 . under the assumption of virial equilibrium , the high stellar velocity dispersion implies an extremely high mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) of about @xmath11 . in order to probe whether the main drivers of scaling in dsphs are the internal collisions and encounters , which strongly depend on the ( core ) density of these systems , a population census of lmxbs , qlmxbs and cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) is highly desirable",
    "this was one of the main goals of our _ xmm - newton _ observation whose results we report in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 reports the details of observations , the data reduction and the source selections criteria . in section 3",
    ", we outline our source classification methodology . in section 4",
    ", the spectral analysis is described for the interesting sources , limits on the x - ray emission from the central black hole are presented , and the diffuse emission spectrum near 3.5  kev is presented . in section 5 , we summarize our results .",
    "the 87  ks image of draco ( fig . 1 ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) was obtained by the european space agency s ( esa ) _ x - ray multi - mirror mission  newton _ ( _ xmm - newton _ ) between august 4 - 28 , 2009 ( pi : k.  dhuga ; see table  1 for details ) .",
    "we used the 3xmm - dr5 ( 3xmm ) catalog @xcite for the automated multiwavelength ( mw ) classification described in section  3.1 .",
    "the parameters obtained from the 3xmm catalog are the source coordinates and x - ray fluxes in 4 different energy bands .    for several of the brighter x - ray sources and for the diffuse background emission ( see section  4 ) we performed spectral analyses and extracted spectra from the epic data .",
    "the observation data files ( odfs ) were processed using standard procedures of the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( xmm - sas version 13.0.1 ) .",
    "the standard sas tool ` edetect - chain ` was used to perform source detections .",
    "we extracted spectra using circular ( @xmath14 ) regions centered on the x - ray sources , for each observation .",
    "background subtraction was performed using source - free apertures located nearby .",
    "a standard event screening described in the ` multixmmselect ` manual was applied .",
    "the spectral analysis of the x - ray data was performed using xspec version 12.7 .",

    "traditional multiwavelength ( mw ) classification includes heuristic examination of the mw source properties , such as x - ray hardness ratios , x - ray / optical / nir flux ratios , color - color , and color - magnitude diagrams in the optical and ir such as those shown in figures 3 , 4 and 5 respectively .",
    "these diagrams allow one to devise crude criteria to discriminate between the sources of different nature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while the mw analysis is often the only reliable way to unveil the nature of unknown x - ray sources , traditional classification , based on drawing dividing lines in the mw diagrams is a very laborious process lacking any quantitative classification confidence criterium .",
    "there are over a hundred x - ray sources in the 3xmm catalog in the draco field .",
    "we visually inspected all sources , and after excluding source duplications ( in 5 separate observations of draco ) and spurious detections ( e.g. , edge of the chip , bad ccd columns ) we selected 35 bright x - ray sources with @xmath17 for further investigation .",
    "table  3 lists the source parameters : x - ray flux @xmath18 in @xmath19  kev range and two hardness ratios hr2 and hr4 defined as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are the observed fluxes in the respective energy bands .",
    "figure  3 shows the hardness ratio diagram for the sources in draco compared to different classes of literature verified sources used for automated classification ( see a1 for details ) .",
    "the two chosen hardness ratios allow for a some separation between agns and the rest of the sources , although there is an expected overlap between the agns , cvs , and pulsars .",
    "similarly , we used color - color diagrams to compare the sources in draco to known sources of different classes ( agn , cv , pulsars etc . ) .",
    "the left panel of figure 4 shows a good degree of separation between the stars and agn in terms of ir to x - ray flux ratio , which is often used to separate the two classes .",
    "the color - color diagram in the right panel of figure 4 also shows clear separation between the agn and stars but it also allows to see noticeable separation between the agn and cvs .",
    "we also utilize color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ; see figure  5 ) and visually inspect the _ hst _ and sdss images .",
    "the former allows us to estimate the age of stellar sources , which in turn helps to determine whether a given star is part of draco .",
    "if a star , whose absolute magnitude is calculated for the draco distance , happens to land onto a @xmath23  gyr isochrone , it is unlikely to be part of draco , because the stellar population of the dsph is at least several billion years old @xcite .",
    "agns have a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that is different from that of stars , and , therefore , on different cmds , agns `` jump '' between different isochrones , or do not land on one at all .",

    "we note that while the _ hst _ images reveal multiple counterparts for some of the sources , the surveys are not as deep , and , therefore , pick up only the brightest objects in the @xmath33 search radius around each source .",

    "we run 1,000 simulations where we randomly populate with 35 synthetic x - ray sources the optical / nir / ir field of draco ( similar to e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we then count the average number of optical / nir / ir counterparts to the synthetic x - ray sources within the @xmath38 radius .",
    "this method results in 0.9 , 1.9 , 0.08 , and 0.27 ( for usno - b1 , sdss , 2mass , and wise surveys , respectively ) spurious detections of the 35 sources .",
    "the third method we employed was to offset each x - ray sources in random direction ( within @xmath41 of its original position ) .",
    "this led to 1 , 1.8 , 0.1 , and 0.4 ( for usno - b1 , sdss , 2mass , and wise surveys , respectively ) spurious detections in 1,000 simulations .",
    "therefore , all three methods give very similar results suggesting only 1 - 2 spurious detections , compared to the 26 x - ray sources for which we find optical / nir / ir counterparts ( see table  3 ) .",
    "our goals are to identify and/or set constraints on the numbers of xrbs that may belong to draco , set a limit on the emission from a possible central intermediate mass bh , and look for a possible dm decay line in the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "below , we discuss individually several sources that do not appear to be agns or foreground galactic stars based on the color - color and color - magnitude diagrams , hst / sdss images , and automated classification . for the brightest of these sources we performed spectral fits with blackbody radiation ( ` bbodyrad ` ) , disk blackbody ( ` diskbb ` ) and power law ( pl ) models modified by interstellar absorption ( ` phabs ` model in xspec ) . in general",

    "the x - ray luminosity , @xmath58  erg  s@xmath1 , is too high for a redback or black widow type binary unless it goes through an outburst episode and switches to an accretion state ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the x - ray lightcurve does not show any significant variability during all five _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that # 10 is a _ non - accreting _ msp in a galactic binary with a late type companion at a distance of @xmath59kpc with the x - rays being emitted from the hot polar cap of the ns .",
    "however , the large ( compared to the galactic ) absorbing column would be puzzling in this scenario .",
    "* source # 11 : * the x - ray spectrum requires two components , ` bbody ` ( bb)+pl , as pl or bb models alone do not provide acceptable fit to the data .",
    "both the temperature ( @xmath60kev ) and the photon index ( @xmath61 ) are not uncommon for several object types ( e.g. , agn and cv ) but even for the two - component model the data show systematic excess below @xmath62kev over the best fit , suggesting that even softer component is needed .",
    "although the luminosity of @xmath63  erg  s@xmath1 at @xmath64  kpc is typical of a redback or black widow system , the spectrum is unusually soft for these kind of binaries .",
    "the absorbing column is uncertain and low , consistent with the galactic value .",
    "the _ hst _ observations ( figure  2 )",
    "show a point - like source and an extended structure , which may or may not be related to the point source . given the large density of background galaxies in the deep _ hst _ images , it is possible that we are seeing the superposition of a star ( either in draco or in the galaxy ) and a background galaxy / agn .",
    "this could explain why the automated classification is confused ( split between agn and cv ) .",
    "we found no variability between five _ xmm - newton _ exposures .",
    "* source # 16 : * this source is strongly ( intrinsically ) absorbed with an odd jump @xmath65 kev in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the source s optical / nir properties are consistent with those of an evolved low - mass single star , but the apparently high absorption in x - rays rules out an active corona in a nearby star as a source of x - rays .",
    "it is possible that this source is a symbiotic star or cv in draco .",
    "in fact , the x - ray spectrum shows signs of emission line(s ) from the iron complex ( figure  6 ) .",
    "the spectrum also shows hints of other lines at lower ( 1@xmath152kev ) energies",
    ". this could be indicative of a magnetic cv @xcite .",
    "we would like to note that symbiotic stars are not a separate class in our current training dataset for muwclass and therefore such a system would be classified as another object type .",

    "the authors suggest that the optical colors can be explained by a symbiotic binary ( red giant with hot main sequence companion ) .",
    "@xcite also claim that # 17 is in draco based on radial velocity measurements .",
    "however , the observed x - ray flux implies a high x - ray luminosity of @xmath66ergs@xmath1 at the distance of draco , which can hardly be produced in a non - degenerate binary with red giant and late - type main - sequence star .",
    "therefore , we consider this source to be a good candidate for a quiescent xrb in draco .",
    "the automated classification did not produce a confident result .",
    "the confusion could be due to the unusual sed noticed by @xcite who also suggested that the star can be in a binary with a ( pre-)degenerate object or it can be a star caught very early in the process of ejecting the outer layers and forming a planetary nebula . if the object does not fit any of the predefined object classes the automated algorithm is expected to be confused .",
    "* source # 19 : * given its x - ray flux and lack of optical counterpart ( arguing against binary nature ) , it is unlikely that this source would belong to draco ( x - ray luminosity , @xmath67  erg  s@xmath1 , for @xmath64  kpc , is too high for isolated nss ) , so it could be an old recycled or non - recycled pulsar in a non - accreting binary in our galaxy .",
    "however , the source is imaged strongly off - axis in the _ xmm - newton _ image which increases the positional uncertainty , even though source # 19 has one of the smallest positional uncertainties in table  3 ( possibly underestimated by the automated source detection tool in 3xmm ) .",
    "there is an sdss source within @xmath68 with @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "if this sdss source is a counterpart of the x - ray source , it would exclude the possibility of # 19 being nearby isolated pulsar / ns , which otherwise would be possible based on x - ray spectrum and lack of optical / ir counterparts .",
    "the lack of optical / ir data prevents our algorithm from confidently classifying this source .",
    "* source # 23 : * the source is faint with a soft x - ray spectrum , too soft for typical agn .",
    "there is some evidence of even further hardening beyond 5@xmath156 kev in pn .",
    "pl and bremss provide a reasonable fit to the data . our automated algorithm does not provide a confident classification , likely due to incomplete mw parameters ( a very faint counterpart found in sdss , but not in 2mass ) .",
    "note that nine sources lack counterparts in sdss .",
    "these could be agns that are too faint to be detected in sdss , or unusual objects that produce little emission in the optical , such as isolated nss or quiescent bh binaries in draco .",
    "of those nine , only source # 25 was imaged by _",
    "hst _ ( figure  2 ) .",
    "two point - like objects are seen within the @xmath38 circle , one of which could be the counterpart of x - ray source .",
    "if this is the case , it could be lmxb / cv in draco ( based on the optical brightness ) . unfortunately , no multi - band photometry exist for this field , which prevents us from classifying the possible optical counterpart of the source .",
    "after careful examination of all x - ray sources we find 4 potentially interesting sources ( # 10 , # 16 , # 17 and # 25 ) that could belong to draco and be potential lmxbs , cvs and/or symbiotic candidates .",
    "we note in passing that sculptor is reported to host 5 lmxbs @xcite and fornax to have 2@xmath153 `` field '' lmxbs ( i.e. , not part of fornax globular clusters , which have another 2 lmxbs ; ) .",
    "given the small number statistics and lack of certainty in association with draco ( except , perhaps , source # 16 and # 17 ) , our findings are roughly on par with those for sculptor and fornax ( both of which are milky way satellites and at roughly the same distance as draco ) .",
    "however , we caution the reader that the respective analyses use different techniques and rely on different mw data and therefore a direct comparison is speculative at best .",
    "@xcite recently presented optical spectroscopy for stars in the draco field .",
    "they fit stellar models to the all sources and produced a dataset with the derived properties ( line - off - sight velocity , @xmath74 , effective temperature , @xmath75 , surface gravity , @xmath76 , metallicity , [ fe / h ] , etc . ) .",
    "we cross - match the spectroscopic dataset with the positions of the 35 x - ray sources , and found 5 matches  sources # 9 , # 16 , # 17 , # 22 , and # 30 .",
    "the optical spectroscopy for sources # 9 , # 22 , and # 30 has very low signal - to - noise ( s / n @xmath77 ) , which resulted in very uncertain fit parameters and , hence , no classifications are provided in @xcite .",
    "these low signal - to - noise sources were classified ( by our algorithm ) as agn ( in agreement with figure  4 ) .",
    "sources # 16 and # 17 have @xmath78 , which is consistent with @xmath74 of draco , and therefore , suggests the association of the two sources with the dsph .",
    "spectroscopy suggests that these two sources are evolved , low - mass stars , which is consistent with cv / lmxb scenarios discussed above .",
    "it has been speculated that dsphs can host an intermediate mass bhs ( imbhs ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we estimate the x - ray luminosity for a putative imbh in draco due to bondi - hoyle accretion as    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the radiative efficiency , and @xmath81 is the hydrogen number density in draco . based on observational results",
    ", we estimate an upper limit of @xmath82  @xmath83 , and sound speed @xmath84  km  s@xmath1 for dsphs , which should be of the order of the stellar velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "therefore the corresponding flux at the distance of draco is    @xmath85    according to the _",
    "3xmm _ catalog there are four x - ray sources with @xmath86 within @xmath87 of the center of draco ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the measured flux for the nearest source is @xmath90ergs@xmath1  @xmath51 ( the other three sources have similar fluxes and s / n ) .",
    "according to the expected radiative efficiency for synchrotron radiation ( presumably the dominate radiation mechanism for a slowly accreting bh ) is @xmath91 . assuming that one of these x - ray sources is the putative imbh , we can then estimate its mass . however , it is possible that none of these faint x - ray sources represent the putative imbh",
    ". therefore , we also can determine the lower limit on the imbh flux by measuring the diffuse flux fluctuations ( @xmath92  erg  s@xmath1  @xmath51 at 3@xmath93 level ) in the local background in the combined epic image .",
    "this leads to the following constraint    @xmath94    theoretical models and observational constraints ( e.g. , @xcite ) show that the central bh mass would depend on the velocity dispersion as    @xmath95    based on the draco velocity dispersion measurement by hargreaves et al .",
    "this mass estimate is comparable with the limit calculated above .",
    "we note , however , that the mass estimate is based on the use of the upper limit on the hydrogen density and a rather optimistic efficiency of 10@xmath96 .",
    "more conservative values for the density and ( especially ) the efficiency ( where the uncertainty is the largest ) could easily reduce the mass limit by several orders of magnitude",
    ".      we also searched for the @xmath97  kev line that has been previously reported in the perseus galaxy cluster @xcite and m31 @xcite .",
    "figure  7 shows the x - ray spectrum of the diffuse epic - pn emission from 0.5 to 10.0 kev .",
    "no significant spectral features consistent with previously reported line at @xmath97  kev is seen .     at 1.49 kev and cu florescent at 8 kev .",

    "we have analyzed 35 ( bright ) x - ray sources detected by _ xmm - newton _ in the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "along with traditional techniques of classification such as the use of color - color and color - magnitude diagrams and hardness ratios , we have utilized an automated machine - learning approach to identify x - rays sources in draco .",
    "these were complimented by the analysis of _",
    "hst_/sdss images and x - ray spectra for several interesting x - ray sources .",
    "our main results are :    * the classification of x - ray sources in draco resulted in 12 agn and 3 foreground stars .",

    "the associations are supported by the line - of - sight velocity measurements reported in @xcite . *",
    "the upper limit on the mass of the imbh that we obtained from the x - ray data analysis is similar to the predictions based on the velocity dispersion correlation .",
    "the current data are consistent with the none existence of a central black hole , however a deeper observation may result in such a detection . * we do not find any significant evidence of 3.5  kev emission line which could be a signature of decaying dm .",
