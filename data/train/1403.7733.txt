    "@xmath173 of a signed graph @xmath2 was defined by zaslavsky in @xcite .",
    "its circuits are the sets of edges of one of the following two types : balanced cycles and the union of two unbalanced cycles meeting in at most one vertex . in his ph.d .",
    "thesis shih proved the following characterisation of graphic lift matroids ( see also @xcite , theorem 4.1 ) .",
    "[ shih - pivotto ] let @xmath1 be a graph and let @xmath2 be a signed graph such that @xmath174 .",

    "however , the signed graph @xmath2 in theorem  [ shih - pivotto](3 ) may have vertex - disjoint unbalanced cycles , so we only need to find all signed graphs having no vertex - disjoint unbalanced cycles .",
    "evidently , when @xmath2 is obtained through  [ shih - pivotto](1 ) , that is , obtained as a pinch , @xmath2 has no two vertex - disjoint unbalanced cycles . on the other hand , note that @xmath2 has no vertex - disjoint unbalanced cycles if and only if each cycle of @xmath1 is connected in @xmath48 .",
    "thus , we only need to determine under which conditions a cycle of @xmath15 is connected in @xmath48 , for the graph @xmath15 ( 2-isomorphic to @xmath1 ) given in theorem  [ shih - pivotto ] .",
