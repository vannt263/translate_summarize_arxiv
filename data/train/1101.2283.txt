    "nonlinear conduction in correlated electron systems such as one - dimensional mott insulators@xcite and two - dimensional charge - ordered materials@xcite has been of great interest in the past few decades .",

    "the threshold is given as @xmath11 with @xmath5 being an energy gap .",
    "a mean - field approach to electric - field - induced insulator - to - metal transitions by using keldysh green s functions has been reported in ref . .",
    "the latter approach is to consider an insulator attached to electrodes .",
    "interface structures must be explicitly taken into account in real electric devices .",
    "along this line , okamoto investigated the current - voltage ( @xmath12-@xmath13 ) characteristics of heterostructures that consist of mott - insulator layers sandwiched by metallic leads by combining the dynamical mean - field theory with the keldysh green s function technique.@xcite ajisaka _ et al .",

    "the present method can be easily applied to higher - dimensional systems .",
    "preliminary results for the @xmath12-@xmath13 characteristics of two - dimensional charge - ordered systems are reported in ref . .",

    "<S> nonequilibrium states induced by an applied bias voltage @xmath0 and the corresponding current - voltage characteristics of one - dimensional models describing band and mott insulators are investigated theoretically by using nonequilibrium green s functions . </S>",
    "<S> we attach the models to metallic electrodes whose effects are incorporated into the self - energy . </S>",
    "<S> modulation of the electron density and the scalar potential coming from the additional long - range interaction are calculated self - consistently within the hartree approximation . for both models of band and mott insulators with length @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the bias voltage induces a breakdown of the insulating state , whose threshold shows a crossover depending on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is determined basically by the bias @xmath2 for @xmath1 smaller than the correlation length @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the bandwidth and @xmath5 the energy gap . for systems with @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> the threshold is governed by the electric field , @xmath7 , which is consistent with a landau - zener - type breakdown , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the spatial dependence of the scalar potential is crucially important for this crossover by showing the case without the scalar potential , where the breakdown occurs at @xmath2 regardless of the length @xmath1 . </S>"
