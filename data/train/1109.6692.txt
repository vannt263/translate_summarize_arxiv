    "the no@xmath1a experiment will study neutrino oscillations from @xmath2 to @xmath3 using the numi off - axis beam at fermilab .",
    "the main goal of no@xmath1a is to search for electron neutrino @xmath3 appearance .",
    "the no@xmath1a detectors have been designed especially to identify electrons and provide good background rejection for selecting electron neutrino interactions .",
    "observation of @xmath4 appearance allows for measurement of @xmath5 , a search for the mass ordering , and a search for the cp violating phase @xmath6 .",
    "secondary goals of the no@xmath1a include improving the measurement of the @xmath2 disappearance parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 and cross section measurements  @xcite . + the no@xmath1a experiment consist of two detectors , a near detector and a far detector , which will be located at different locations .",
    "the near detector will be located at fermilab and the far detector will be located 810 km away from the near at ash river , minnesota . the no@xmath1a experiment will use a new type of detector , made of plastic pvc and liquid scintillator .",
    "the initial objective for the no@xmath1a experiment is to obtain a good understanding of the detector for neutrino interactions .",
    "this is currently being achieved with a near detector prototype called ( ndos ) .",
    "the no@xmath1a near detector prototype is located on the surface at fermilab .",
    "the dimensions of the detector are 2.9 m wide , 4.2 m high , and 14.3 m long .",
    "the detector is made of 60@xmath9 active pvc plus liquid scintillator and a muon catcher made from iron .",
    "the total mass is 222 tons with 125 tons of active material and a fiducial mass for neutrinos interactions of 20 tons .",
    "figure  [ detectorfigure ] illustrates these regions with different colors .",
    "the detector is constructed with rigid pvc cells .",
    "these cells are filled with liquid scintillator .",
    "each cell has a wavelength shifting fiber ; as shown in  figure  [ detectorfigure ] which illustrates a cell with a fiber that is looped at the bottom .",
    "when a charged particle goes through the cell , the scintillator produces light .",
    "this light bounces around the rectangular cell which has a width of 3.87 cm and depth of 6 cm until the lights gets captured by a wavelength shifting fiber or absorbed by the pvc or the scintillator .",
    "both ends of the fiber are connected to one pixel on an avalanche photodiode ( apd ) .",
    "this light is converted to an electric signal and processed through the data acquisition system .",
    "this prototype provides essential information on ; assembly technique , scintillator filling , light yield , apd installation and functioning , electronics installation and functioning , daq functioning .",
    "the ndos is placed @xmath10 off the axis of the numi beam and on the axis of the booster beam .",
    "figure  [ locationfigure ] illustrates the location of the detector .",
    "the detector is located on the surface between the miniboone detector hall and the minos service building .",
    "the beam of neutrinos from numi is generated by focusing 120 gev protons from the main injector onto a graphite target  @xcite .",
    "this interaction produces mesons ( pions and kaons ) , which are focused by two magnetic focusing horns located downstream the target . the mesons decay in a pipe filled with he at 1atm , which is 675 m in length and 2 m in diameter producing neutrinos .",
    "the two magnetic horns are pulsed with a 200ka current . because the two horns focus positively charged particles and defocus negatively charged particles , changing the horn current polarity produces either a neutrino or an antineutrino beam .",
    "the mesons will primarily decay through the channels @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "also the muons decay and produce @xmath13 .",
    "+ the beam of neutrinos from the booster is generated by focusing 8 gev protons from the booster onto a beryllium target .",
    "the process to produce neutrinos is similar as for the numi beam described previously , but with one horn  @xcite .",
    "the ndos collects neutrino and antineutrino data from numi and antineutrino data from the booster .",
    "the simulated neutrino energy spectra are shown in  figure  [ spetrumfigure ] .",
    "the neutrino mode from numi shows two peaks , the low energy peak is produced from the pion decay and the peak around @xmath14gev is produced from the kaon decay .",
    "+ the physics goals for ndos are : +    * determine the composition of the beam .",
    "* investigate the detector sensitivity to cosmic ray background .",
    "* study the response of the detector to electron neutrino interactions .",
    "* measure the rate of neutrino interactions for the quasi - elastic ( qe ) interactions .",
    "recent experiments have made measurements of cross sections for the qe interactions .",
    "the miniboone experiment produces neutrinos with a mean energy of approximately @xmath15mev  @xcite and the nomad experiment uses an average energy of the incoming neutrino around @xmath16gev  @xcite .",
    "in addition the sciboone experiment using the same neutrino beam as miniboone made a measurement for the low energy region similar to the low energy region of the miniboone experiment . the measurement from sciboone experiment",
    "is in agreement with the miniboone experiment measurement .",
    "figure  [ qefigure ] shows the measurements of the charged - current qe cross section from the current experiments .",
    "these experiments have covered energy regions above and below @xmath14gev . however , around the 2gev peak these experiments show a disagreement .",
    "the mean @xmath2 energy for the ndos peaks around 2gev , which allows us to study this region .",
    "the qe studies in ndos will also help to develop the analysis for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 no@xmath1a measurements .",
    "+        the near detector prototype will collect data for a year .",
    "for an exposure of @xmath17 protons on target and 20 tons of fiducial mass , the expected events rates are shown in  table  [ eventrate ] .",
    ".event rates in ndos . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ datamctable ]        in summary we have developed a selection criterion to find neutrino candidates and separate them from cosmic background .",
    "the next step is to positively identify muon neutrino charged - current events .  figure  [ mceventfigure ] on the top plot shows an example of a simulated charged - current quasi - elastic interactions and the bottom plot shows a simulated neutral current interaction .",
    "both interactions contain two tracks .",
    "the qe interaction has a track from a muon and a track from a proton .",
    "the muon has a long trajectory and the proton a short trajectory .",
    "the proton deposits more energy per cell than the muon .",
    "the neutral current interaction has a proton and pion , the pion from the neutral current interaction deposits more energy per plane than the muon for the quasi elastic interaction .",
    "the energy deposition and distance traveled by the pion and the muon are different .",
    "this allows us to separate charged - current interactions from neutral current interactions .",
    "we are currently developing a selection method to select charged - current cc interactions from neutral - current nc interactions .",
    "the method is based on a simple likelihood method which uses as input three probability density functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "+ we build a probability given by the multiplication of each pdf for each cc and nc interaction .",
    "the probability can be written as follows : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the individual pdfs for the cc and the nc interactions .",
    "+ using these probabilities an event separation is defined : @xmath20 using the antineutrino mode mc , the distributions of the input variables used for each pdf are obtained and shown in  figure  [ variablesfigure ] .",
    "the fiducial selection defined is applied when calculating the three pdfs .",
    "in addition to this selection we require 4 hits in each view and the angle direction selection cos@xmath21 , to reject the cosmic background .",
    "the first plot on the left shows the energy deposited by the longest track in photoelectron units ( pe ) .",
    "the center plot displays the track length of the longest track , and demonstrates that tracks from cc - induced events are longer than the ones reconstructed in nc interactions .",
    "the third plot is the mean energy deposition by plane in unity of pe .",
    "this plot shows that nc interactions deposit more energy per plane than cc interactions .              using the formulation in eq .",
    "[ separation ] , we compute the simulated cc / nc event separator . +         the left distribution in  figure  [ separationfigure ] shows the event separator for the cc and nc interactions and the right distribution the efficiency vs purity .",
    "the event separator for the cc interaction shows two peaks .",
    "the two peaks are due of the neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "this is shown in the simulated neutrino energy spectrum  figure  [ spetrumfigure ] .",
    "+ the ndos will collect a small data sample of cc interactions and nc interactions .",
    "therefore , it is essential to tune the selection so that most cc events are retained , but with sufficient background rejection necessary for further analysis .",
    "figure  [ separationfigure2 ] shows the efficiency and purity as a function of each separator cut .",
    "a good compromise is obtained by accepting all events with a value of the separator variable larger than 1.5 .",
    "this selection results in @xmath22 purity and @xmath23 efficiency .",
    "+         [ separationfigure2 ]    an alternative visual scanning method was used to select cc events .",
    "this method gives a purity of @xmath24 and an efficiency of @xmath25 .",
    "the results from the scanning method are comparable with the simple likehood method .",
    "the preliminary cc selection method presented here will improve as the quality of the event reconstruction method improves .",
    "a possible next step will be to improve the @xmath26 , @xmath27 rejection using information from michel electrons , which are produced in end - point decay of muons .",
    "this will allow us to differentiate the muons from cc interactions from the pions in nc interactions . at a later stage ,",
    "identification of quasi - elastic @xmath2 cc interactions will be pursued .",
    "+ no@xmath1a has a working prototype near detector , taking neutrino and cosmic data .",
    "the ndos is taking data from both the numi and booster neutrino beams .",
    "data analysis methods are currently under development , with focus on selection of cc events and later on quasi - elastic cc events .",
    "when the near detector starts operations underground in 2013 , it will collect much higher statistics , which will allow us to make neutrino cross section measurements with high precision .",
