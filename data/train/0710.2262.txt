    "propagation of light rays from a distant source to the observer is governed by the gravitational field of intervening mass fluctuations as well as by the global geometry of the universe .",
    "the images of background sources hence carry the imprint of the gravitational potential of intervening cosmic structures , and their statistical properties can be used to test the background cosmological models .",
    "weak gravitational lensing is responsible for the weak shape - distortion and magnification of the images of background sources due to the gravitational field of intervening matter ( e.g. , bartelmann & schneider 2001 ; umetsu , futamase , & tada 1999 ) . to the first order ,",
    "weak lensing gives rise to a few  @xmath2 levels of elliptical distortions in images of background sources , responsible for the second - order derivatives of the gravitational lensing potential .",
    "thus , the weak lensing signal , measured from tiny but coherent quadrupole distortions in galaxy shapes , can provide a direct measure of the projected mass distribution of cosmic structures . however , practical weak lensing observations subject to the effects of atmospheric seeing , isotropic / anisotropic psf , and ( residual ) camera distortion across the field of view , which must be examined from the stellar shape measurements and corrected for in the weak lensing analysis .",
    "practical methods for psf corrections and shear measurements / calibrations have been studied and developed by many authors , such as pioneering work of kaiser , squires , & broadhurst ( 1995 , hereafter ksb ) , the shapelets technique which describes psf and object images in terms of gaussian - hermite expansions ( refregier 2003 ) , and recent systematic , collaborative efforts by the shear testing programme ( heymans et al .",

    "2007 ) .",
    "thanks to these successful developments in weak lensing techniques as well as in instrument technology , the quadrupole weak lensing has become one of the most important tools in observational cosmology to map the mass distribution in individual clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , kaiser & squires 1993 ; broadhurst et al .",

    "2001 ) .    in recent years",
    ", there have been theoretical efforts to include the next higher order distortion effects as well as the usual quadrupole distortion effect in the weak lensing analysis ( goldberg & natarajan 2002 ; goldberg & bacon 2005 ; bacon et al .",
    "2006 ; irwin & shmakova 2006 ; goldberg & leonard 2007 ; okura , umetsu , & futamase 2007 ) .",
    "we have proposed in okura , umetsu , & futamase ( 2007 , hereafter ouf ) to use certain convenient combinations of octopole / higher multipole moments of background images which we call the higher order lensing image s characteristics ( holics ) , and have shown that holics serve as a direct measure for the next higher - order weak lensing effect , or the gravitational flexion ( goldberg & bacon 2005 ) and that the use of holics in addition to the quadrupole shape distortions can improve the accuracy and resolution of weak lensing mass reconstructions based on simulated observations .",
    "recently , goldberg & leonard ( 2007 ) extended the holics approach for flexion measurements to include observational effects , namely the gaussian weighting in shape - moment calculations ( see the appendix therein ) and the isotropic psf effect , under the assumption that psf is nearly circular , and tested their extended holics approach with simulated and hst / acs observations .",
    "leonard et al . (",
    "2007 ) have applied the extended holics method to reconstruct the projected mass distribution in the central region of the massive galaxy cluster a1689 at @xmath0 , and revealed substructures associated with small clumps of galaxies .",
    "further leonard et al . ( 2007 ) found that in dense systems such as galaxy clusters the holics technique is robust and less sensitive than the shapelet technique to contamination by light from the extended wings of lens / foreground galaxies .    in the present paper",
    "we develop a method for measuring flexion by the holics approach by fully extending the ksb formalism ; we take into account explicitly the effects of gaussian weighting in calculation of noisy shape moments and higher - order psf anisotropy as well as isotropic psf smearing .",
    "we then apply our method to actual , ground - based subaru observations of a1689 , and perform a mass reconstruction in the central region of a1689 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first summarize in  2 the basis of weak gravitational lensing and the flexion formalism . in  3 , we derive the relationship between holics and flexion by incorporating gaussian smoothing in shape measurements in the presence of isotropic and anisotropic psf . the practical method to correct the",
    "isotropic / anisotropic psf effects will be presented in  4 . in section 5",
    "we use simulations to test our flexion analysis method based on the holics moment approach .",
    "we then perform a weak lensing flexion analysis of a1689 by our fully - extended holics approach , and perform a mass reconstruction of a1689 from the holics estimates of flexion .",
    "finally summary and discussions are given in  6 .",
    "we refer interested readers to a complete appendix for details of the derivation of flexion - observable relationships in practical observations .",
    "in this section , we summarize general aspects of weak gravitational lensing and flexion formalism , following the complex derivative notation developed by bacon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . a general review of quadrupole weak lensing can be found in bartelmann & schneider ( 2001 ) .",
    "we define the spin for weak - lensing quantities in the following way : a quantity is said to have spin @xmath3 if it has the same value after rotation by @xmath4 .",
    "the product of spin-@xmath5 and spin-@xmath6 quantities has spin @xmath7 , and the product of spin-@xmath5 and spin-@xmath8 quantities has spin @xmath9 .",
    "then , as we shall see in the next subsection , the lensing convergence @xmath10 is a spin-0 ( scalar ) quantity .",
    "the complex shear @xmath11 and the reduced shear @xmath12 are spin-2 quantities .",
    "the first and second flexion fields , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are a spin-1 and a spin-3 quantity , respectively .",
    "the gravitational deflection of light rays can be described by the lens equation , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the effective lensing potential , which is defined by the two - dimensional poisson equation as @xmath17 , with the lensing convergence . here",
    "the convergence @xmath18 is the dimensionless surface mass density projected on the sky , normalized with respect to the critical surface mass density of gravitational lensing , @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the angular diameter distances from the observer to the deflector , from the observer to the source , and from the deflector to the source , respectively . by introducing the complex gradient operator , @xmath23 that transforms as a vector , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being the angle of rotation , the lensing convergence @xmath10 is expressed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "similarly , the complex gravitational shear of spin-2 is defined as @xmath28 the third - order derivatives of @xmath16 can be combined to from a pair of the complex flexion fields as ( bacon et al .",
    "2006 ) : @xmath29 if the angular size of an image is small compared to the scale over which the lens potential @xmath30 varies , then we can locally expand the lens equation ( [ eq : lenseq ] ) to have : @xmath31 to the second order , where @xmath32 is the jacobian matrix of the lens equation and @xmath33 is the third - order lensing tensor , @xmath34 the third - order tensor @xmath35 can be expressed with the sum of the two terms , @xmath36 , with the spin-1 part @xmath37 and the spin-3 part @xmath38 , composed of the real / imaginary part of the flexion fields : @xmath39 note that flexion has a dimension of inverse length ( or inverse angle ) , meaning that the flexion effect depends on the angular size of the source .",
    "the shape quantities affected by the first flexion @xmath40 alone have spin-1 properties , while those affected by the second flexion @xmath41 alone have spin-3 properties .",
    "these third - order lensing fields naturally appear in the transformation equations of holics between the lens and source planes .      in the ksb approach ,",
    "we use quadrupole moments @xmath42 of the surface brightness distribution @xmath43 of background images for quantifying the shape of the images : @xmath44{\\delta\\theta}_i { \\delta\\theta}_j}{\\int d^2\\theta\\,q_i[i(\\btheta)]},\\ ] ] where @xmath45 $ ] denotes the weight function used in noisy shape measurements and @xmath46 is the offset vector from the image centroid .",

    "however , in the presence of gravitational lensing , this apparent center can be different from the point @xmath55 that is mapped using the lens equation ( [ eq : lenseq ] ) from the center of the unlensed light , @xmath56 .",
    "we refer to this point as the `` true '' center of the image .",
    "the difference between these two centers , namely , the apparent and the true centers , causes a significant effect in evaluating the first flexion , as pointed out by goldberg & bacon ( 2005 ) .",

    "we note that , the above equations ( [ eq : zeta ] ) and ( [ eq : delta ] ) are obtained under the sub - critical lensing condition , i.e. , @xmath80 ( see schneider & er 2007 ) .    since the holics @xmath68 and @xmath69 are non - zero spin quantities with a direction dependence , the expectation value of the intrinsic @xmath68 and @xmath69 are assumed to vanish . to the first order in flexion",
    ", we have the linear relations between the holics and flexion fields as @xmath81",
    "for a practical application of the holics approach , we must take into account various observational effects such as noise in the shape measurement due to readout and/or sky background and the dilution of the lensing signal due to the isotropic / anisotropic psf effects .",
    "thus , one can not simply use equations ( [ eq : zeta ] ) and ( [ eq : delta ] ) to measure the flexion fields . in this section ,",
    "we introduce the gaussian weighting in moment calculations , as done in the ksb formalism for quadrupole weak lensing , and derive the relevant transformation equations between unlensed and lensed holics by taking into account explicitly the effect of gaussian smoothing .",
    "now we introduce a weight function @xmath82 having a characteristic width @xmath83 for practical , noisy moment measurements , redefining the octopole and 16-pole moments of the brightness distribution @xmath43 as @xmath84 where @xmath85s here are no longer normalized with the corresponding _ flux _ of the image ( see equation [ [ eq : qij ] ] ) .",
    "the redefined shape moments enter equation ( [ eq : holics ] ) .",
    "we provide in appendix detailed definitions of holics in practical applications .",
    "when weighted moments are used for calculating holics , the centroid shift due to lensing ( [ eq : csft ] ) , to the first order , is changed in the following way : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the apparent and the true centers of the image ( see  [ subsec : csfgl ] ) , respectively , in the complex form calculated using the weight function @xmath89 , @xmath90 is the monopole shape moment ( or _ flux _ ) , quantities with subscript `` a '' represent those calculated with respect to the apparent center , and quantities with prime represent those measured with @xmath91 as the weight function instead of @xmath89 ; @xmath92 is the spin-0 coefficient in @xmath93 .",
    "the deviation from unity in the denominator of @xmath92 is obtained by properly expanding the weight function w(x ) in moment calculations , and this term does not appear in goldberg & leonard ( 2006 ) s formulation .",
    "hence , the complex displacement from the true image center , @xmath94 , can be expressed in terms of that from the apparent image center , @xmath95 , and the complex centroid shift , @xmath93 , as @xmath96 for interested readers , we refer to full appendix b.1 for detailed calculations of the lensing - induced centroid shift with a weight function .      in weighted moment calculations ,",
    "the transformation equations between holics and flexion must be modified accordingly . to the first order , we have @xmath97 where quantities with subscript `` t '' represent those calculated with respect to the true center , or using @xmath98 . by using equation ( [ eq : csf_complex ] )",
    ", we can express @xmath99 and @xmath100 in terms of practically observable quantities ( with subscript `` a '' ) as @xmath101 to the first order . here the term @xmath102 in equation ( [ eq : zeta_t ] ) is again caused by the centroid shift in the weight function ( a similar , but different , expression was obtained by goldberg & leonard 2007 ) .",
    "finally , we obtain the following transformation equations in the case of weighted moment calculations : @xmath103,\\\\ \\delta^{(s ) } & \\approx & \\frac{1}{1-\\kappa } \\left [ \\delta^a-\\left(\\frac{3}{4}+\\frac{{\\upsilon^a_0}'}{4\\xi^a\\sigma^2}\\right)g \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we show the details of these calculations in full appendix b.3 .",
    "in this section we present a detailed prescription for the psf anisotropy and circularization correction in holics - based flexion measurements by extending the ksb formalism .",
    "we closely follow the treatment and the notation given in  4.6.1 of bartelmann & schneider ( 2001 ) .",

    "we used our weak lensing analysis pipeline based on imcat ( kaiser et al .",

    "we selected a stellar sample of @xmath242 objects for measuring the anisotropic / isotropic psf effects . on the basis of the simulation results ,",

    "these lower cutoffs in the galaxy size are essential for reliable flexion measurements , because the smaller the object , the noisier its shape measurement due to pixelization noise ; and the shape of an image whose intrinsic size is smaller than or comparable to the psf size can be highly distorted and smeared , as we have seen in ",

    "in the present paper , we have developed a method for weak lensing flexion analysis by fully extending the ksb method to include the measurement of holics ( ouf ) .",
    "in particular , we take into account explicitly the weight function in calculations of noisy shape moments and the effects of spin-1 and spin-3 psf anisotropies , as well as isotropic psf smearing , in the limit of weak lensing and small psf anisotropy ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the higher order weak lensing effect induces a centroid shift in the observed image of the background ( goldberg & bacon 2005 ; ouf ; goldberg & leonard 2007 ) . in weighted moment calculations",
    ", this will yield in the flexion measurement additional correction terms ( relevant to @xmath280 ) that must be taken into account by properly expanding the weight function @xmath89 .",
    "it is found that neglecting these additional terms originated from the taylor expansion of @xmath89 yields the same result as obtained by goldberg & leonard ( 2007 ; see appendix therein ) . we extended the ksb formalism to include the higher - order isotropic and anisotropic psf effects relevant to spin-1 and spin-3 holics by following the prescription given by ksb and bartelmann & schneider ( 2001 ) , which provides direct relations between the observable holics and underlying flexion in the weak lensing limit .",
    "we have implemented in our analysis pipeline our flexion analysis algorithm based on the holics moment approach , and tested the reliability and limitation of our psf correction scheme using numerical simulations .",
    "our simulation results show that ( i ) after applying our psf correction method the psf - induced anisotropies in holics of mock galaxy images can be considerably reduced by a factor of @xmath281@xmath282 , depending on the strength of psf anisotropy , ( ii ) those small galaxies whose angular size is smaller than or comparable to the size of psf suffer from severe anisotropic psf effects , and that ( iii ) there is an overall trend that the fractional correction factor is larger for larger galaxy images .",
    "therefore , our simulation results support the reliability of our psf - correction scheme and its practical implementation .",
    "based on the simulation results , we have applied our flexion analysis pipeline to ground - based @xmath232 imaging data of the rich cluster a1689 ( @xmath0 ) taken with subaru / suprime - cam . our flexion analysis of subaru a1689 data revealed a non - negligible , significant effect of higher - order psf anisotropy induced in stellar images ( figures [ fig : zetaq_field ] and [ fig : zetaq ] ) .",
    "it is therefore important in practical flexion measurements to quantify and correct for the higher - order anisotropic psf effects .",
    "our mass reconstruction from the first - flexion measurements shows two significant ( @xmath283 ) mass structures associated with concentrations of bright galaxies in the central cluster region : the first peak ( @xmath273 ) associated with the central concentration of bright galaxies including the cd galaxy , and the second peak ( @xmath276 ) associated with a clump of bright galaxies located @xmath284 northeast of the cluster center .",
    "this significant detection of the second peak confirms earlier acs results from the strong lensing analysis ( broadhurst et al .",
    "2005b ; halkola et al . 2006",
    "; leonard et al . 2007 ) and the combined strong lensing , weak shear , and flexion analysis by leonard et al .",
    "the central mass peak , however , was not recovered in the earlier flexion analysis by leonard et al .",
    "( 2007 ) based on hst / acs data .",
    "leonard et al . ( 2007 ) attributed this to their relatively large reconstruction error at the cluster center , although they have a very large number density of background galaxies , @xmath285 arcmin@xmath256 . on the other hand ,",
    "owing to our conservative selection criteria for the background sample , the mean number density of background galaxies used for the present analysis is @xmath286 arcmin@xmath256 , which is almost one order of magnitude smaller than that of the acs data , and is about @xmath287 of a typical number density of magnitude / size - selected background galaxies usable for the quadrupole shape measurements in ground - based subaru observations ( @xmath288 ) .",
    "however , we found that it is rather important to remove small / faint galaxy images and noisy outliers in flexion measurements since they are likely to be affected by the residual psf anisotropy and/or observational noise in the shape measurement (  [ subsec : sim ] ) . besides , the smaller the object , the larger the amplitude of intrinsic flexion contributions .",
    "recall that flexion and holics have a dimension of length inverse : the response to flexion is size - dependent , and the amplitude of intrinsic flexion is inversely proportional to the object size .",
    "indeed , we find that inclusion of smaller objects results in a noisy reconstruction .",
    "similar values of the background number density , @xmath289 , have been used in recent quadrupole weak lensing analyses based on subaru observations ( e.g. , broadhurst et al .",
    "2005a ; umetsu & broadhurst 2007 ; weak lensing cluster mass measurements of okabe & umetsu 2008 )",
    ". in their studies only objects redder than the cluster sequence are selected in color - magnitude space for their weak lensing analysis , because such a red population is expected to comprise only background galaxies ( @xmath290 ; see , e.g. , medezinski et al .",
    "2007 ) , made redder by relatively large @xmath291-corrections and with negligible contamination by cluster galaxies ( broadhurst et al .",
    "2005a ; medezinski et al .",
    "however , the smaller number of objects implies a coarser angular resolution in the map - making for achieving a proper signal - to - noise ratio ( e.g. , per - pixel @xmath292 ) . with @xmath293 for cluster quadrupole weak lensing , typical angular resolutions are about @xmath294 arcmin ( e.g. , gaussian fwhm , or boxcar width ) . on the other hand , flexion measures essentially the gradient of the tidal gravitational shear field ( i.e. , @xmath295 ) , and hence is relatively sensitive to small - scale structures .",
    "therefore , our successful reconstruction of the mass substructures with a small background density , @xmath296 , could be attributed to the superior sensitivity of flexion to small scale structures ( see ouf for detailed discussions ) and the here - adopted selection criteria for a background galaxy sample for weak lensing flexion analysis .",
    "finally , we emphasize that our holics formalism here is different from the earlier work by goldberg & leonard ( 2007 ) in that ( 1 ) additional correction terms for the centroid shift , relevant to the derivatives of the weight function , have been included and ( 2 ) the spin-1 and spin-3 psf anisotropies , as well as the isotropic psf smearing , have been taken into account under the assumption of small psf anisotropy ( @xmath297 $ ] ) , as done in the ksb formalism .",
