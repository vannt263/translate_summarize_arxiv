    "due to the charge - independent nature of the strong nuclear force , it is possible to model the proton and neutron as spin - like `` isospin '' states of a single particle , the nucleon .",
    "this isospin model treats both the proton and the neutron as degenerate particles with isospin @xmath9 , but with opposite isospin projections : @xmath10 for neutrons and @xmath11 for protons @xcite .",
    "thus , nuclei that share a given total mass number @xmath0 can be seen as total projection states , each with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the number of neutrons and protons , respectively . each energy level in a given nucleus itself possesses a total isospin @xmath1 , so it is possible to treat analogous states in isobaric nuclei as members of a @xmath15-member multiplet , each with the same @xmath1 and a different isospin projection @xmath16 .    under this symmetric formalism , analogous energy states with the same isospin",
    "have exactly the same mass excess values @xmath17",
    ". however , electrostatic effects perturb the energies of nuclear analog states with differing numbers of protons , breaking this degeneracy and resulting in systematically different energies for multiplet members .",
    "first proposed by wigner , the isobaric multiplet mass equation ( imme ) @xcite is a model that uses first - order perturbation theory to predict that the mass excesses of nuclear isobaric analog states ( ias ) within an isospin multiplet are systematically related by their isospin projections @xmath16 according to the following quadratic equation :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are coefficients that can either be calculated using the perturbation theory or obtained from a quadratic fit of the measured mass excesses of the multiplet members .",
    "the imme can thus be used to predict the energies of unobserved multiplet states , and measurements of these states can be compared with the quadratic form of the imme in order to test its validity .",
    "a breakdown of the imme could indicate a failure of the perturbation theory and a need for higher - order terms , the presence of many - body charge - dependent forces @xcite , isospin mixing of the ias with other nearby states of different isospin @xcite , or inaccurate measurements .",
    "historically , the imme has been very successful at describing experimental values , requiring very few deviations from the quadratic form . as discussed in refs . @xcite and @xcite , in situations where the fit of the quadratic form is very poor , a cubic or quartic form with extra terms @xmath22 or @xmath23",
    "may be required .",
    "typically , these terms have been determined empirically to be either very small , @xmath241 kev , or consistent with zero .",
    "a number of situations where a @xmath25 term has been required are noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , including the @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath28 quintets and the @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath4 quartets ; these and other cases are discussed here .    in the @xmath31 quintet",
    "mentioned above , multiple studies @xcite have noted the need for a significant cubic term in the imme , @xmath32 and @xmath33 kev for refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the recent evaluation of ref .",
    "@xcite confirmed that a quartic function was most likely an even better fit to the data and suggested the need for both theoretical and experimental studies of the multiplet members to address the imme breakdown . a penning trap measurement of multiple isotopes including @xmath34 mg @xcite reported breakdowns of the imme for the @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath37 quartets , requiring cubic terms of @xmath38 kev and @xmath39 kev , respectively .",
    "the @xmath40 quintet is currently the most precisely measured quintent . here , a precise penning trap measurement of @xmath41si @xcite led to an observed breakdown of the imme , requiring a small , but very significant , cubic term @xmath42 kev , which was supported by a measurement of the @xmath41cl mass using the @xmath41s(@xmath43he,@xmath44)@xmath41cl reaction @xcite .",
    "a later precision measurement of the @xmath2s mass @xcite led to an even greater precision on the @xmath41cl mass excess and found that no combination of various literature values could produce a fit that validated the imme for the @xmath40 quintet .",
    "a recent review of mass measurements @xcite suggested that new mass measurements of other multiplet members might revalidate the imme in this quintet , and a theoretical study of the quintet @xcite demonstrated that the imme deviation , as well as the observed isospin - forbidden proton decay from the @xmath28 @xmath41cl ias and a correction to the @xmath45 superallowed decay from @xmath41ar , could be traced to isospin mixing of the @xmath28 states with @xmath46 states . in the @xmath47 case ,",
    "a relatively large @xmath25 coefficient of @xmath48 kev was clearly required to fit the data .",
    "although no definite solution has been found yet , both inaccurate experimental data and isospin mixing have been suggested as potential causes for the breakdown @xcite .    in several instances of imme breakdown",
    ", additional study has revalidated the quadratic imme .",
    "reference @xcite reported , in addition to the findings on @xmath34 mg , a new @xmath49 mg mass and a resulting imme breakdown requiring a cubic term of 2.8(11 ) kev for the @xmath50 quintent . in this case , a recent experimental measurement of @xmath49 mg @xmath51 decay @xcite used the superallowed @xmath45 transition to the @xmath28 @xmath49na ias and the state s subsequent @xmath5 decay to deduce an excitation energy for the ias .",
    "this result was 28 times more precise than the previous measurement and , together with the ground state mass excess of @xmath49na , was shown to revalidate the imme for the @xmath50 quintet .",
    "a storage ring mass measurement of a number of @xmath52 shell nuclei , including @xmath53ni @xcite , found that an imme fit of the lowest @xmath54 quartet required an enormous cubic term of @xmath55 kev , a @xmath56 deviation from the quadratic imme . in this latter case , as in the @xmath57 case , the imme was revalidated after a measurement of @xmath53ni @xmath51-delayed @xmath5 decay @xcite which produced a more precise @xmath53co ias excitation energy and a cubic imme fit with a @xmath25 coefficient compatible with zero . in the @xmath58 case",
    "mentioned above , a relatively large @xmath25 coefficient of @xmath59 kev was required to fit the imme .",
    "this anomaly was found through high - precision mass measurements of @xmath60li and @xmath60be to be the result of isospin mixing in @xmath60b and @xmath60be @xcite .    in the lowest @xmath61 , @xmath4 quartet",
    ", it has until recently been difficult to test the imme because the experimental mass excess value of @xmath2cl has been relatively imprecise .",
    "a 1977 experimental measurement of the @xmath62ar(@xmath43he,@xmath63li)@xmath2cl @xmath64 value resulted in a mass excess value of @xmath65 kev @xcite .",
    "subsequent evalutions of the imme @xcite have included adjusted central values of this mass excess , but the uncertainty has remained .",
    "in contrast to high - precision mass excess and excitation energy values of the relevant states in @xmath2s @xcite and @xmath2p @xcite ( based on mass measurements of those nuclei and experimental measurements of their excitation energies ) and in @xmath2si ( based on mass measurements of @xmath66si @xcite and neutron - capture reaction measurements linking the isotopes from @xmath66si to @xmath2si @xcite ) , the 50-kev uncertainty in the @xmath2cl mass excess has hindered attempts to test the imme stringently in the lowest quartet .",
    "a recent penning trap mass measurement of @xmath2cl finally obtained a value for the ground state mass excess 15 times more precise than previous estimates @xcite , leading to an imme breakdown in the lowest quartet ; the imme fit required an unusually large cubic term , with @xmath67 kev .",
    "similar to the lowest quartet , uncertainties associated with both the energy of the first excited state in @xmath2cl and the identity of the second @xmath4 state in @xmath2s have precluded a quality test of the imme in the second quartet .",
    "in fact , a tentative measurement of the first @xmath2cl excited state via @xmath2ar @xmath51 decay @xcite was the only evidence for the observation of that state @xcite until a recent coulomb - breakup experiment was performed to confirm the existence of the state @xcite .",
    "the excitation energy was found in ref .",
    "@xcite to be @xmath68 kev , leaving the identity of the second @xmath4 state in @xmath2s as the primary ambiguity in the quartet .",
    "various sources have reported excitation energies for the @xmath2s state ranging from a definite @xmath4 assignment for a state at @xmath69 kev using the @xmath66si(@xmath43he,@xmath70)@xmath2s reaction @xcite with somewhat low precision to a relatively precise , but tentative , assignment for a state at @xmath71 kev @xcite , with alternative candidates at 6975(3 ) @xcite and 7053(2 ) kev @xcite .",
    "although this @xmath36 @xmath2s state is expected to be nearly 1 mev above the proton threshold , the proton emission is isospin forbidden and , therefore , it should have a substantial @xmath5-decay branch unlike the other low - spin levels in the region @xcite .",
    "precise observation of a high energy @xmath5-ray transition from a low - spin state in this region would be a signature of the second @xmath4 state , allowing for a precise determination of its energy .",
    "the shell model predicts that the state decays predominantly to the ground state , and shell model calculations using the universal @xmath72-shell version `` b '' ( usdb ) @xcite and the recently - developed version `` e '' ( usde ) @xcite models predict a @xmath2s state 745(50 ) kev above the @xmath2s ias energy of @xmath73 kev . in the shell model",

    "in addition , a precision measurement of the second @xmath4 @xmath2s state is reported , allowing for the most stringent test of the imme to date for the second @xmath3 quartet .",

    "the @xmath51-delayed @xmath5 decay of @xmath2cl was measured using an experimental procedure that was already described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , a fast beam of up to 9000 @xmath2cl ions per second was implanted into a plastic scintillator , which acted as a @xmath51-decay trigger .",
    "the @xmath51-delayed @xmath5 rays were detected using the clovershare array : nine `` clover '' detectors of four ge crystals each , surrounding the plastic scintillator .",
    "data from the crystals were gain - matched and calibrated to produce @xmath75 and @xmath76 spectra , the latter of which were gated on a variety of deexciting @xmath5 rays . from these data ,",
    "a decay scheme was constructed including the observed @xmath2s levels and their excitation energies and @xmath51 feedings .",
    "absolute @xmath75 intensities for the observed @xmath5 rays were also determined . in the present work we focus on the @xmath4 states .",

    "we explore the impact of isospin mixing on the imme for the lowest @xmath3 quartet . in order to use the imme fit , we needed values for both the ground - state mass excesses of the multiplet members and the @xmath2s and @xmath2p ias excitation energies .",

    "while potential candidate @xmath9 states exist for mixing in each of these nuclei , no experimental evidence was observed to positively identify such a state in @xmath2s .",
    "for example , no @xmath5-ray transitions were observed for any states between @xmath8 kev and @xmath210 kev in either the @xmath75 or the @xmath76 coincidence spectra .      to estimate",
    "the amount of mixing that might occur , we have used both the usde and usdb calculations to predict energy levels and mixing matrix elements for both @xmath2s and @xmath2p ( table [ usdcalcs2 ] ) .",
    "both models produce small mixing matrix elements , consistent with the implication from our imme fit that the mixing is small , with the lack of observation of other @xmath5-ray branches in the energy region , and with the small ratio of proton emission to @xmath5 decay of the 7050-kev state .      using our high - precision measurement of the excitation energy of the second @xmath4 state in @xmath2s",
    ", it is possible to predict the energy of the first excited @xmath2cl state with a higher precision .",
    "using the @xmath2s , @xmath2p , and @xmath2si input mass excess values and excitation energies in table [ inputtable1 ] to produce the imme curve , and accounting for the uncertainty introduced by the possibility of isospin mixing via the @xmath25 coefficient in the cubic fit , the resulting imme mass excess is @xmath211 kev . when combined with the known @xmath2cl ground state mass excess from ref . @xcite and its uncertainty , the predicted excitation energy of the state is @xmath212 kev , consistent with the measured value of @xmath68 kev @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to calculate the energy of the state using the @xmath80s @xmath213 resonance energy based on the @xmath51@xmath187 measurement , @xmath214 @xcite and the recent value of the proton separation energy , @xmath215 @xcite : the result is @xmath216 , which is consistent with our prediction within 1.8 combined standard deviations and with the value from ref .",
    "@xcite within 1.6 combined standard deviations .",
    "given the slight tension between the value based on the @xmath217 measurement @xcite and the other two values , a new measurement of @xmath2ar @xmath51 decay @xcite with high sensitivity to low - energy protons would be an interesting study .",
    "the problem of imme breakdown in the lowest @xmath3 quartet may be a result of isospin mixing in one or more of the multiplet members .",
    "we have measured the excitation energy of the @xmath2s ias and found that it is isospin mixed with a nearby @xmath9 state . however , we have shown that the isospin mixing in @xmath2s alone can not explain the imme breakdown observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but that incorporating similar mixing in @xmath2p could account for the breakdown .",
    "better experimental data are needed to search for the hypothesized @xmath218 @xmath2p state that may be mixing with the ias .",
    "the state at 6461 kev is the best existing candidate for this state , but is not consistent with shell model predictions and should be investigated further .",
    "it is not certain that every @xmath2p state in the energy region has been observed .",
    "future experiments could focus on gamma spectroscopy of this region in @xmath2p to complement the numerous charged particle reaction measurements carried out to - date .",
    "the question of isospin mixing in @xmath2p likely holds the key to explaining the imme breakdown in the lowest @xmath3 quartet ; uncovering the structure in the important energy region slightly above @xmath8 kev could lead to a deeper understanding of the perturbative effects of isospin mixing on this widely - used theoretical model .",
    "in addition , the clear identification of the second @xmath219 @xmath2s state at 7050 kev in the present work has completed the second @xmath3 quartet .",
    "three of the four quartet member states now have mass - excess uncertainties @xmath220 kev and their masses are well - described by the quadratic form of the imme .",
    "further studies of this multiplet could focus on reducing the uncertainty of the energy of the first excited @xmath2cl state .",
    "a new @xmath2ar @xmath51 decay study could provide an independent measurement of the @xmath51-delayed proton energy , and in - beam @xmath221ray spectroscopy , while challenging due to the very small expected @xmath5-decay branching ratio of the state , might present a novel approach to measuring the excitation energy of this state .",
