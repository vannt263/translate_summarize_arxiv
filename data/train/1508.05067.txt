    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are an important probe for the distant universe reaching the epoch of cosmic reionization ( @xmath5 ) , giving us useful information such as the cosmic star formation rate ( see piran 2005 ; mszros 2006 ; zhang 2007 ; gehrels et al .",
    "2009 for reviews ) . when a high precision optical / near - infrared spectrum is taken for a grb afterglow in the reionization era , light at wavelengths shorter than the redshifted ly@xmath1 is almost completely absorbed by neutral hydrogen in igm , and so - called gunn - peterson troughs",
    "because of the strength of ly@xmath1 absorption , gp troughs give only a weak lower bound for the igm neutral fraction as @xmath6 .",
    "however , the shape of redward ly@xmath1 damping wing can be used to further constrain @xmath2 and hence the reionization history , because igm h would affect the shape of the wing , in addition to the wing by h in the host galaxy ( miralda - escude 1998 ) .",
    "grbs have a few advantages against quasars about this test .",
    "they are expected to occur in more normal and less dense regions than quasars , and short duration of grb emission does not affect the ionization status around host galaxies .",
    "the simple power - law spectrum of grb afterglows is suitable for a precise fit to the damping wing shape .",
    "however , use of grbs for reionization study has been hampered by the low event rate of high-@xmath7 grbs that are bright enough for high precision damping wing analyses .",
    "a weak upper bound on igm h was obtained for grb 050904 at @xmath8 ( kawai et al .",
    "2006 ; totani et al . 2006 ) , but meaningful constraints on reionization could not be derived by grbs at even higher redshifts ( greiner et al .",

    "2013 ; golenetskii et al . 2013 ; castro - tirado et al .",
    "2013 ) at @xmath0 provided us with the best opportunity so far for this purpose , by its exceptional brightness and relatively low h column density in the host galaxy and constraints on reionization have been derived ( chornock et al .",
    "2014 ; melandri et al .",
    "2015 ) , but the afterglow was not as bright as that of grb 130606a . ] .",
    "however , the reported constraints on @xmath2 using spectra taken by different telescopes are controversial .",
    "chornock et al . (",
    "2013 ) derived an upper bound of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) using the spectrum taken by gemini .",
    "in contrast , totani et al .",
    "( 2014 , hereafter paper i ) found a @xmath11 evidence for igm h with @xmath12 from the spectrum taken by subaru .",
    "it was argued that the choice of the baseline power - law index @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) in chornock et al . is not supported by the observed optical / nir colors favoring @xmath15 .",
    "this has been confirmed by the optical - nir spectrum by vlt , reporting @xmath16 ( hartoog et al .",
    "2014 , hereafter h14 ) .    however , this is not the end of the story .",
    "the analysis of the damping wing by h14 using the vlt spectrum found no evidence for igm h , setting an upper limit on @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this is statistically inconsistent with the result of our paper i , indicating the systematic uncertainties in the subaru / vlt spectra and/or analysis methods .",
    "grb 130606a has proven that a high precision damping wing analysis for grb spectra in the reionization era is indeed possible , and understanding systematics in such analyses is crucial for future studies using more grbs at higher redshifts to derive reliable constraints on reionization .",
    "therefore we decided to analyze the vlt spectrum by our own code used for the fitting to the subaru spectrum in paper i , to reveal the origin of the discrepant results .",
    "this is the primary aim of this work .",
    "another aim of this work is to examine the effect of adopted formulae for the ly@xmath1 cross section as a function of wavelength .",
    "several different formulae have been used in the literature to calculate the damping wing shape by h in a host galaxy and igm , including the simplest lorentzian ( or the voigt profile when convolved with the gaussian velocity distribution ) , and the two - level approximation formula by peebles ( 1993 , hereafter p93 ) . in high precision damping wing analyses ,",
    "difference of the adopted formulae may result in systematic biases . here",
    "we repeat our analyses using different cross section formulae , including the most recent formula by bach & lee ( 2015 , hereafter bl15 ) that takes into account the fully quantum mechanical scattering based on the second - order time - dependent perturbation theory , and see how the results change .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we adopt the same model parameter values as those in paper i. the h column density in the host galaxy , @xmath19 , is expressed in units of @xmath20 .",
    "first we directly compare the subaru and vlt spectra of grb 130606a , which were taken during 10.413.2 and 7.28.7 hr after the burst , respectively .",
    "we use the one - dimensional vlt spectrum and its statistical error , which were reduced by the vlt team and provided to us .",
    "the original vlt spectrum has a wavelength binning size of 0.20  , which is smaller than 0.74  for the subaru spectrum . to compare the two spectra on the same wavelength grids , the vlt spectrum was converted into that on the subaru grids .",
    "this was done first by associating every vlt grid to the closest subaru grid , and then by taking the average over the vlt grids associated to a subaru grid .",
    "the two spectra on the same grids are then shown in fig . [",
    "fig : vlt_vs_subaru ] .",
    "the @xmath21 error at regions without strong airglow emission is typically 1.0% and 1.5% of the continuum level for subaru and vlt , respectively , on this same wavelength grids .",
    "the vlt spectrum shows finer structure because of the better spectral resolution ( @xmath22 and 8700 , respectively ) .",
    "the ratio of the two spectra is also shown in this figure .",
    "though there are fluctuations on @xmath23 10  scale , no systematic trend is found on scales longer than 100  .      in paper",
    "i , we considered two different models for the igm h distribution ; in one model , the igm h is assumed to extend up to the same redshift as the grb , i.e. , @xmath24 , while in the other model , @xmath25 is set at 5.83 motivated by a deep gp trough observed at @xmath26 5.675.83 to the sightline of this grb ( chornock et al",
    "if @xmath27 , and contribution to the damping wing is mostly from a redshift interval of @xmath28 from @xmath25 [ see fig",
    ". 7 of totani et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ] , corresponding to a proper distance of @xmath29 mpc . ]",
    "it should be noted here that the damping wing shape is calculated assuming that igm h is uniformly distributed with a constant comoving density , which is obviously too simple compared with the expected realistic distribution . though it is not the purpose of this paper to examine this effect ,",
    "this should be kept in mind when the implications for reionization are discussed .",
    "the best - fit model parameters are @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the former and latter , respectively .",
    "the @xmath32 difference between the two models is not statistically significant , but both the two models show a @xmath11 statistical preference to the model without igm h. it should be noted that some other possibilities of reddening absorption [ extinction in the host galaxy or intervening damped ly@xmath1 systems ( dlas ) ] have been ruled out in paper i.    however , h14 reported @xmath16 from their optical+nir spectrum , indicating that the low @xmath33 model in paper i is now disfavored . therefore in this paper",
    "we consider only the @xmath34 model with the power index fixed at @xmath35 , to compare the subaru and vlt spectra reported by h14 is smaller than the typical statistical uncertainties of free @xmath36 fits in paper i , and hence we do not marginalize the error of the h14 @xmath36 measurement . ] .",
    "then the model parameters are : the column density of h in the host galaxy @xmath19 , the 1@xmath37 gaussian velocity dispersion @xmath38 of h in the host galaxy , @xmath2 of igm h , and the overall normalization factor .",
    "the fit results of the host h only model ( @xmath2 fixed to zero ) and the host+igm h model ( @xmath39 treated as a free parameter ) to the subaru and vlt spectra are shown in table [ table : subaru_vs_vlt ] and figs [ fig : fit_subaru ] and [ fig : fit_vlt ] . here",

    "+ @xmath43the survey range of @xmath38 ( @xmath44 of the gaussian velocity distribution of host h ) is limited to 0100 km / s , motivated from the observed widths of the metal absorption lines ( paper i ) .",
    "+ @xmath45the number of data points is 68 .",
    "+ @xmath46the @xmath32 excess of the host h only model against the host+igm h model .",
    "the fit results to the subaru spectrum with the fixed value of @xmath47 are similar to the @xmath48 model with free @xmath36 reported in paper i ; a non - zero igm contribution with @xmath49 0.06 is favored than the host h only model . the relative flux difference between the two models is only @xmath23 0.5% level , but the overall statistical significance is @xmath50 thanks to the small statistical error of the spectrum . it should be noted that the errors on the subaru spectrum are uncorrelated among different wavelength bins and the scatter is consistent with the gaussian ( paper i ) .",
    "there are 68 data points in the fit , and there are four model parameters in the host+igm h model .",
    "the @xmath32 value of 80.62 for @xmath51 degrees of freedom is not unreasonable ( 8% chance probability of getting a larger value ) .",
    "the reason why the igm h component improves the fit can be seen in the residuals ( normalized by the observed flux error ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_subaru ] .",
    "the fit residuals of the host only model tend to be positive at longer wavelength range of 88008900  , but tend to be negative at 84808560  , indicating that another absorption component is necessary to make the spectrum further redder .",
    "it is impossible to do this by increasing the amount of host h , because it would result in too large absorption in the shortest wavelength range of 84208460  .",
    "since h in igm is more distant from the grb than h in the host , the damping wing by igm h has weaker wavelength dependence than that by host h ( see fig . 2 of paper i ) .",
    "this is the key for the fit improvement by igm h. it should also be noted that a reduction of the scatter of residuals by igm h is seen in 84208460  .",
    "this indicates that the damping wing shape with igm h is in better agreement with the observed data than the host h only model , giving a further support for the model with igm h.    now we examine the fit results to the vlt spectrum .",
    "we confirmed the same result as that to the subaru spectrum ; non - zero igm h contribution is favored with the best fit value of @xmath52 which is statistically consistent with @xmath53 found with the subaru spectrum .",
    "the residuals of the fit to the vlt spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_vlt ] show the same systematic trend as those of the subaru fit ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_subaru ] ) .",
    "therefore the evidence for igm h contribution to the observed damping wing reported in paper i is further strengthened by an independent spectrum taken by vlt .",
    "the @xmath32 difference implies that the host+igm h model is preferred to the host only model with a statistical significance of @xmath54 .",
    "however , the residuals shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_subaru ] are on average significantly larger that the expectation of the gaussian distribution , suggesting that the errors calculated by the vlt analysis pipeline are underestimated .",
    "we discussed about this with the vlt team , and it is most likely because the lower signal - to - noise ratio with respect to the subaru spectrum makes the systematic noise due to the bright sky emission lines more prominent .",
    "the vlt spectrum was taken with an exposure time considerably shorter than that for subaru , and the air mass was also larger .",
    "the median of absolute values of the residuals for the host+igm h model is 1.221 , while 0.674 is expected for the gaussian distribution .",
    "if we scale the error size by the ratio of 1.221/0.674 , the significance is reduced to 1.9@xmath37 . in this work",
    "we do not discuss the statistical significance about the vlt spectrum further .",
    "these results indicate that the discrepant conclusions ( evidence for igm h by paper i , while no evidence found by h14 ) are a result of difference in analysis methods , rather than the systematic difference between the two spectra . concerning this",
    ", we note that the wavelength range fitted by h14 , 84068462   ( corresponding to relative velocities of 02000 km / s to ly@xmath1 ) , is significantly shorter compared with 84268900   adopted in our paper i. it should be noted that the evidence for igm h in our analysis is found in the spectral shape spanning in the whole wavelength range .",
    "another difference is that we excluded the shortest wavelength range of @xmath55 8426  . as shown in fig . 2 of paper",
    "i , the h absorption in this region is dominated by the host h rather than the igm component with @xmath56 .",
    "the observed spectrum rapidly drops with decreasing wavelength at @xmath4  , making a precise model fitting difficult because of uncertainties about the velocity distribution of h in the host and spectral resolution .",
    "though the gaussian velocity distribution has been taken into account for the host h , such a pure gaussian distribution is unlikely in a realistic galaxy , as inferred from high resolution spectroscopic studies of dlas ( wolfe et al .",
    "2005 ; see also paper i for more discussion ) .",
    "this is why in paper i we used only wavelength longer than @xmath57  ; this boundary was determined so that the fit result becomes mostly insensitive to the host h velocity dispersion , @xmath38 ( see table [ table : subaru_vs_vlt ] ) .    to test the effect of the wavelength range used , we performed the damping wing fit to the subaru spectrum with the same wavelength range as h14 .",
    "indeed , we found a similar result to h14 ; the best fit is @xmath58 with upper bounds of @xmath59 and 0.088 at 1 and 2@xmath37 , respectively , @xmath60 = 19.855@xmath610.009 , and @xmath62 km / s .",
    "the small error of @xmath38 indicates that the fit in this region is highly sensitive to the host h velocity distribution , but systematic uncertainty should be large if the distribution is not a simple gaussian .",
    "in paper i we used the two - level approximation formula of p93 for the ly@xmath1 cross section as a function of wavelength . in the calculation of the damping wing by igm h",
    ", we further used the analytic formula of miralda - escude ( 1998 ) , which also assumes the p93 formula and uses an approximation valid when the frequency is far from the resonance @xmath63 to make the analytic integration possible , where @xmath64 is the damping constant of ly@xmath1 . though this approximation is very good ( corresponding to @xmath65 ) for the practical damping wing analysis , we revised our code to numerically integrate the igm damping wing , to calculate it for arbitrary formulae of ly@xmath1 cross section .    here",
    "we test three different formulae of ly@xmath1 cross section : the lorentzian , the classical rayleigh scattering formula , and the fitting formula of bl15 taking into account the quantum mechanical scattering effect , in addition to the p93 formula used in paper i. ( see bl15 for the exact expressions of these formulae . ) fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_section ] shows the change of h optical depth as a function of wavelength for different formulae , using the best - fit parameters of the host+igm h model to the subaru spectrum of grb 130606a . the change relative to the lorentzian becomes larger with increasing wavelength , reaching 1020% at 8900  .",
    "the rayleigh and p93 formulae result in smaller optical depth , but the bl15 formula larger , compared with the lorentzian",
    ". then we repeated our damping wing fitting analysis on the subaru spectrum for the host h only and host+igm h models , and @xmath32 are presented in table [ table : cross_section ] .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath39 changes by less than 8% .",
    "the bl15 formula results in the smallest significance of the statistical preference for the non - zero @xmath2 to the host h only model , but still it is larger than @xmath66 .",

    "see also table [ table : subaru_vs_vlt ] for more explanations .",
    "this paper investigated the origin of the discrepant results about the constraint on igm h fraction from ly@xmath1 damping wing analyses of the subaru and vlt spectra for grb 130606a at @xmath67 .",
    "direct comparison between the two spectra does not show any systematic difference on the overall shape in the wavelength range of 84268900   used in paper i. we repeated exactly the same analysis as paper i for the vlt spectrum converted onto the wavelength grids points of the subaru spectrum , and confirmed our previous result of more than @xmath18 statistical preference for non - zero contribution from igm h with @xmath680.050.1 ( assuming uniform distribution of igm h up to the redshift of the grb ) .",
    "the absorption by igm is dominated by h within @xmath28 from the upper redshift bound ( @xmath48 ) , corresponding to a proper distance of @xmath29 mpc .",
    "the host h only model is disfavored because of the systematic trend of fit residuals ( positive at 86408900  , while negative at 84508560  ) indicating that another absorption component is necessary to make the spectrum redder , in addition to h in the host galaxy .",
    "this trend has been confirmed also using the vlt spectrum .",
    "therefore we consider that the discrepant results were obtained because of different analyses methods .",
    "h14 adopted the wavelength range of 84068462  , which overlaps only with the shortest part of the range adopted by us in paper i , and h14 also included the deep ly@xmath1 absorption region down to the resonant ly@xmath1 wavelength ( 8406  ) . in paper",
    "i we excluded the wavelengths shorter than 8426   because this region is highly sensitive to the velocity distribution of h in the host galaxy , which is rather uncertain and unlikely to be a pure gaussian .",
    "indeed , we found a result consistent with h14 ( i.e. , no evidence for non - zero @xmath2 ) when we adopted the same wavelength range as h14 .",
    "finally , we examined the robustness of these results against the adopted ly@xmath1 cross section formulae , by testing the lorentzian , rayleigh scattering formula , and the latest bl15 fitting formula taking into account a fully quantum mechanical scattering effect , in addition to the peebles two - level approximation formula used in paper i. we found that the preference for the non - zero @xmath39 is robust against the difference of these formulae .",
    "the bl15 formula results in the lowest statistical significance , but still it is greater than 3.1@xmath37 and the best - fit @xmath2 changes at most 8%",
    ". however this effect is quantitatively not negligible , and one must be careful about the ly@xmath1 cross section formulae in future studies .",
    "these results demonstrate that high precision ly@xmath1 damping wing analyses of high-@xmath7 grb afterglows are a powerful approach to measure igm h fraction , which is sensitive to a small value of @xmath69 .",
    "the same results were obtained by the two spectra taken by the two different telescopes , when the model fitting method is the same , indicating that the systematic uncertainty of the spectral measurement can be controlled to allow discrimination of sub - percent level relative flux change in the spectral shape . however , a high precision fitting is easily affected by systematic uncertainties about the fitting methods , especially the wavelength range . therefore one must be very careful to minimize the systematic uncertainties , e.g. by checking the sensitivity of the results to the adopted wavelength ranges and other model parameters .",
