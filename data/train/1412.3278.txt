    "since 1999 there have been a series of fascinating high - precision observational investigations into the possible space and time variation of some of the traditional constants of physics , notably the fine structure constant , @xmath0 and the proton - electron mass ratio @xmath1 , ( and combinations of the two ) which have been extensively reviewed @xcite .",
    "indications of possible variations of @xmath2  in time  @xcite and space @xcite and time variations in @xmath3  @xcite have been reported .",
    "these observations have inspired the creation of self - consistent theories in which constants like @xmath4 and @xmath3 are promoted to become scalar fields that gravitate with their own dynamics that conserve energy and momentum @xcite .",
    "such theories extend the philosophy of jordan jordan and brans - dicke @xcite , who first created extensions of general relativity to accommodate variations in the newtonian gravitation constant @xmath5 , to variations of other non - gravitational constants .",

    "self - consistent scalar - tensor theories are needed to evaluate their full cosmological consequences .",
    "theoretical studies have focused on a varying fine - structure constant @xmath4 , which is simplest to develop because of its gauge symmetry @xcite , and a varying proton - electron mass ratio @xmath6 , @xcite .",
    "scaling arguments have also been used to relate changes in @xmath2 to changes in @xmath3  using the internal structure of the standard model , including supersymmetry @xcite . typically ( in the absence of unusual cancellations involving the rates of change of @xmath4 , and the supersymmetry - breaking and grand unification energy scales )",
    ", they predict that changes in @xmath3  at low energies should be about an order of magnitude greater than those in @xmath4 . however , high - redshift cosmological bounds on @xmath3  variation are expected to be weaker than those from laboratory tests of the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "systematic investigations of the spectra of cold h@xmath7 towards quasar sources have now produced a constraint on @xmath3-variation over cosmological time scales yielding @xmath8 at redshifts @xmath9 , corresponding to look - back times of 10 - 12 gyr @xcite .",
    "radio studies have surpassed optical ones in limiting changes in @xmath3 at lower redshifts , with @xmath10 limits of @xmath11 few @xmath12 from comparisons between @xmath13 and rotational lines @xcite , and @xmath14 from multiple methanol lines in a lensing galaxy at @xmath15 bag .",

    "these observational advances lead us to refine our theoretical models and in what follows we review a new way of viewing the theory of varying @xmath4 introduced by bekenstein , sandvik , barrow and magueijo ( bsbm ) in bekenstein1982,sandvik2002 and extended in references @xcite and graham . following recent work @xcite in section  [ diel ]",
    "we show how bsbm may be seen as the actions of a dielectric medium permittivity encoded in scalar field , @xmath36 .",
    "specifically , we will see that @xmath36 acts like a relativistic generalisation of a common dielectric or insulator .",

    "the dielectric analogy suggests a number of extensions of the original bsbm theory , but if we seek to preserve lorentz invariance the options are limited . regarding the effects of @xmath36 upon electromagnetism ,",
    "the theory is fully fixed by lorentz , parity and gauge invariances , but we may still change the dynamics of @xmath36 . if we wish to extend further the analogy with a standard dielectric , then it would make more sense to make @xmath36 a local function of the electromagnetic field . if this function is to be lorentz invariant , it can only depend on the scalar @xmath39 and the pseudo - scalar @xmath40 , but the latter induces parity violations ( and also permits modifications to maxwell s equations , which are beyond the scope of this discussion ) .",
    "the formalism for such _ local _ varying alpha theories is developed in section  [ var1 ] .",
    "the rest of this paper is devoted to exploring some of the phenomenology of these theories . as with torsion theories , it is extremely difficult to constrain the model by local particle physics experiments . in section  self",
    "we show how the problem of the divergence of the classical self - energy of a point particle might be removed or ameliorated within these theories . in section  [ cosmo ]",
    "we start exploring the cosmological solutions , particularly as models for the very early universe .",
    "we close the paper with a discussion of the wider implications .    throughout this paper",
    "we shall use planck units , and employ metrics with signature is @xmath41 .",
    "in this section we describe how the scalar field , @xmath36 , which self - consistently drives variations in the electron charge @xmath42 , and hence in @xmath4 , in bsbm theory , may be interpreted as a dielectric medium @xcite .",
    "the dielectric is linear ( in the sense that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are proportional to @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) and the proportionality constants @xmath37 and @xmath47 are isotropic and frequency independent .",
    "unlike in standard media , @xmath48 and @xmath38 obey a relativistic klein - gordon equation sourced by the em lagrangian @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath49 , the medium is non - dispersive , and so it induces no frequency shift or photon production . the argument was presented in  @xcite , and in fact applies to any varying - alpha theory which preserves relativistic lorentz invariance and the gauge principle .    in setting up electromagnetism under a varying alpha",
    "there is an ambiguity  in the definition of electric and magnetic fields similar to that found for insulators , where one can use @xmath50 or @xmath43 for the electric field , and @xmath46 or @xmath51 for the magnetic field . in reality",
    "both concepts play a role , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 convenient for writing the homogeneous maxwell equations , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 better suited for writing the inhomogeneous equations , even when there are no sources .",
    "varying - alpha theories may be phrased either in terms of @xmath52 ( as in @xcite ) , or @xmath53 ( as in @xcite ) , with the two quantities related by : @xmath54where @xmath55the last expression links @xmath36 to the fine structure constant , @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath56 corresponds to the @xmath37  used in bekenstein1982 , which we stress is _ not _ the relative permittivity of the medium(@xmath37 ,  in our notation here ) , as we shall see .",
    "gauge transformations can be performed as @xmath57or as @xmath58this fork in the development propagates into the definition of gauge - invariant field tensors , with @xcite led to make the natural definition : @xmath59 ,   \\label{fdef}\\]]and @xcite to choose @xmath60the two are related by @xmath61the electromagnetic action , from which the non - homogeneous maxwell s equations are derived , can be written in the two forms : @xmath62    in order to study which quantities play the role of @xmath45 and @xmath63 ( and so give the equivalent of the faraday tensor ) in  blackbody , we examined the non - homogeneous maxwell equations .",
    "these are best written in terms of @xmath64 , in the form of the integrability condition : @xmath65this is obviously a necessary condition for ( [ fdef ] ) , but note that the same argument can not be made directly for @xmath66 ( derivatives of @xmath67 would appear in the corresponding condition in terms of @xmath66 ; cf .",
    "( [ fdef ] ) and ( [ fdef ] ) ) .",
    "thus , in order to parallel the usual theory of electrodynamics in media we should associate @xmath45 and @xmath63 ( appearing in the inhomogeneous maxwell equations ) with @xmath68 , with entries in the usual places . with this identification we obtain the standard inhomogeneous maxwell equations : @xmath69this was already noted in @xcite ( however , the wrong identification was made in ref.@xcite , cf .",
    "their eq.(25 ) ) .    in order to find the equivalent of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , in  blackbody we examined instead the inhomogeneous maxwell equations . in the absence of currents",
    "these can be written in the two forms : @xmath70and we see that neither of them leads to the equivalent standard expression for dielectric media ( in both cases extra terms in the derivatives of @xmath36 appear ) .",
    "therefore , we should define the alternative maxwell  tensor : @xmath71 in terms of which we have @xmath72we should then define @xmath43 and @xmath44 from the appropriate entries in @xmath73 , so as to get : @xmath74with these identifications bsbm becomes equivalent to electromagnetism in dielectric media with only small adaptions .",
    "we have : @xmath75and so @xmath76@xmath43 and @xmath44 are proportional to @xmath45 and @xmath77 , and the proportionality constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 are isotropic and frequency - independent .",
    "the identifications found above suggest an obvious extension of bsbm . in bsbm",
    ", @xmath36 satisfies a driven klein - gordon equation , but in standard electromagnetism the permittivity would be a local function of the fields @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the only relativistically invariant such functions take the form : @xmath78 in this paper we will focus on the first argument of this function , and explicitly develop the formalism and applications for this case . setting up the formalism for the dependence of @xmath36 on the pseudo - scalar @xmath79 is a straightforward extension ( and we will briefly present it at the end of this section ) .",
    "however the phenomenology is entirely different , involving parity violation effects , and a whole new set of phenomena .",
    "we will defer the study of these theories to a future publication .    imposing @xmath80",
    "can be easily implemented in a lagrangian formulation by setting : @xmath81 with no kinetic term for @xmath82 .",
    "then the euler - lagrange equation implies the algebraic relation : @xmath83 from which we can deduce @xmath84 .",
    "this theory implements non - linear em in dielectrics without breaking lorentz invariance .",
    "it differs from bsbm in many ways , most importantly in that it does not induce a fifth force or violations of the weak equivalence principle .",
    "in fact the theory has something in common with the basic torsion theories ( of the form of the einstein - cartan - sciama - kibble type ) , in that its field is non - propagating .",
    "it is algebraically related to electromagnetic field in this case , rather than to the spin density , as is the case with torsion .",
    "the lagrangian of bsbm contains only a kinetic term ; instead , the theories we would like to explore , when recast in the lagrangian formulation , derive from lagrangians which contain only a potential term ( and no kinetic term ) .",
    "obviously we could add a potential to bsbm , but that would not change its qualitative nature , since it would still contain propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "we will not consider that possibility here , because we want to explore the qualitatively different possibility that the permittivity is not a propagating degree of freedom , but like in normal dielectrics , it is an algebraic function of the em field itself",
    ".    note that a _ possible _ generalization of the formalism to include the second argument in  ( [ psifunc ] ) would follow from @xmath85resulting in conditions : @xmath86 in these theories , the maxwell equations would receive corrections due to the parity violating term . other ways to accommodate chirality are possible , and will be further explored elsewhere .",
    "a suitable choice of @xmath87 ( or @xmath88 ) can lead to the removal or softening of classical divergences , specifically in the particle electromagnetic self - energy .",
    "this was once perceived as a major problem ( citations ) and may still interact in non - trivial ways with the more general issue of quantum divergences .",
    "the potential @xmath89 may be seen as a classical effective way to describe quantum effects in the self - interaction .",
    "conversely if we were to postulate it at tree - level , it would affect loop corrections in non - trivial ways . regardless of this",
    "we now exhibit one theory where the coulomb self - energy is finite .",
    "let us assume that : @xmath90then , solving eq .",
    "[ vpeqn ] leads to two solutions .",
    "the branch with the correct limit when the field is small is : @xmath91and we see that this is equivalent to : @xmath92when @xmath93 . since @xmath94 satisfies the poisson equation ( cf .",
    "( [ deqn ] ) ) we have that for a point charge : @xmath95however now the electric field reaches a maximum and then drops to zero : @xmath96clearly there is no singularity in the energy density around a point charge . as @xmath97",
    "we find that @xmath98as explained in  @xcite , the electrostatic energy density in a dielectric ( generalized or otherwise ) is given by : @xmath99and so , as @xmath97 , the energy density tends to a constant : @xmath100    we note that there is still a divergence in the energy associated with the dielectric itself , but this is logarithmic . indeed",
    "the energy associated with the dielectric can be written as : @xmath101and since @xmath102 , the second term diverges only logarithmically .",
    "a closed set of cosmological equations can be found by appealing to energy conservation .",
    "we first review how this is the case in bsbm , before adapting the argument to the theory proposed in this paper . in bsbm ,",
    "the lagrangian for @xmath36 is : @xmath103leading to a forced klein - gordon equation for @xmath36 : @xmath104where @xmath105 ( in what follows we denote by tilded variables those which have factors which are a function of @xmath36 absorbed into their definitions ) . under the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy , this equation becomes the ode : @xmath106and this equation can be interpreted as an energy balance equation , with the driving terms representing energy exchange between @xmath36 and other forms of matter .",
    "homogeneity and isotropy imply that @xmath36 behaves like a perfect fluid , and computing the stress - energy tensor reveals : @xmath107equation ( [ kg ] ) is then equivalent to : @xmath108each component @xmath109 contributes a term proportional to @xmath110 to the right - hand side of ( [ dotrho ] ) .",
    "this should be balanced by a counter - term with opposite sign in the right hand side of the the conservation equation for @xmath109 : @xmath111for all @xmath109 components ( including the dark matter ) we need equations of state relating their energy density with their em lagrangian content .",
    "one possibility is to define parameters : @xmath112for radiation @xmath113 , but @xmath114 for baryonic as well as for some types of dark matter .",
    "we stress that the statement that @xmath115 is a constant is part of the model ( and such a model is _ not _ the model employed for matter in  @xcite ) .    given these considerations we concluded in  @xcite that in bsbm theory , a full closed set of cosmological equations for a matter and radiation universe is : @xmath116here , @xmath117 on the right - hand side of the last two equations is to be written as @xmath118(where we used ( [ rhopsi ] ) ) to form a closed system .",
    "a similar construction can be set up for the theory proposed in this paper , with ( [ kg ] ) replaced by ( [ vpeqn ] ) , or , using the notation in this section : @xmath119 in view of the considerations leading to ( [ zeta ] ) , we can rewrite this as : @xmath120assuming homogeneity and isotropy , the @xmath36 fluid is now made up of pure potential energy , instead of kinetic energy ( as was the case for bsbm ) , so , instead of ( [ rhopsi ] ) , we have @xmath121the conservation equation for the @xmath36-fluid therefore reads : @xmath122where in the last identity we have used ( [ vpeq1 ] ) , and in the first two we have used ( [ rhopv ] ) .",
    "we therefore obtain an equation identical to ( [ dotrho ] ) but with a different equation of state for the @xmath36 fluid .",
    "it can be further expressed as : @xmath123as a result , we know that the right - hand side ( rhs ) of this equation should appear with a reversed sign as a source term to the the matter conservation equation",
    ". the cosmological equations for a radiation - matter universe are therefore : @xmath124this system looks formally identical to the equations obtained for bsbm ( once one accounts for the different equation of state for @xmath36 ) , but in fact the system is entirely different and , in fact in this form , it does not constitute a closed set of odes .",
    "given that we have ( [ rhopv ] ) instead of ( [ rhopsi ] ) we can not write @xmath117 on the rhs of the last two equations as a function of @xmath125 . instead , we should use ( [ vpeqn1 ] ) to write @xmath36 as a function of @xmath126 .",
    "we can then write @xmath117 as : @xmath127given that @xmath128 we can also eliminate @xmath129 from the equations , since @xmath125 in the friedman equation can be written as @xmath130 .",
    "these two steps allow for a rearrangement of the equations into a closed system : @xmath131as our worked examples will now show , in practice these steps are always folded into finding a solution to the system .",
    "we now consider some cosmological application of this theory . we construct models for the early universe , assuming for simplicity a single form of matter ( @xmath132 ) with constant @xmath133 and a general equation of state @xmath134 , with @xmath135 constant .",
    "it is curious that the simplest choices of potential lead to interesting solutions , namely bouncing , loitering and inflationary dynamics .",
    "let us assume a quadratic potential , leaving the sign undefined for the time being : @xmath136the euler - lagrange equation leads to : @xmath137and so we learn that this a model in which the early universe is filled with a dielectric rendering the electric charge exponentially dependent on the density : @xmath138furthermore , we have : @xmath139therefore , following the procedure outlined at the end of last section , we find that the friedmann equation ( see eq .",
    "( [ friedh ] ) ) resembles that obtained in brane - world cosmology when the minus sign is picked : @xmath140however , this theory is very different because the friedmann equation is supplemented by a modified conservation equation ( cf .",
    "( [ consh ] ) ) : @xmath141and therefore the dynamics is potentially very different .",
    "it is easy to prove that the theory still leads to bouncing behaviour .",
    "the conservation equation integrates to : @xmath142or : @xmath143if we choose the minus sign for the potential this model leads to a bounce when the density reaches the maximum : @xmath144we would also expect the @xmath145 term to dominate the effects of simple shear anisotropies on approach to the expansion minimum and create a quasi - isotropic bounce whenever @xmath146 .",
    "another interesting case is that with an exponential potential : @xmath147then : @xmath148so that @xmath149we therefore now have a model in which the early universe behaves like a dielectric for which the electric charge is a power - law of the energy density @xmath150inserting the solution into eq .",
    "( [ consh ] ) gives us the modified conservation equation @xmath151with @xmath152 .",
    "thus , regarding matter evolution , there is an effective shift in the equation of state : @xmath153we see that as @xmath154 we get @xmath155 , i.e. inflation . if @xmath156 , for @xmath157 we have @xmath158 .",
    "this shift in the equation of state transfers into the expected change in the expansion rate , because @xmath159 , and so the friedmann equation reads : @xmath160the only effect in this equation is an effective shift in the gravitational constant @xmath161we can therefore generate acceleration ( certainly an early - time , inflationary one ) with this model .",
    "the extreme case @xmath162 , corresponding to @xmath163is interesting in that gravity seemingly switches off ( since @xmath164 ) .",
    "a static universe is then possible .",
    "close to this value we may induce loitering .",
    "in this paper we have examined an alternative to bsbm varying - alpha theory inspired by conventional dielectrics .",
    "the properties of bsbm theory may be understood from the standard electrodynamics of dielectrics with suitable definitions for the fields @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the displacements @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( associated with the faraday and maxwell tensors , respectively ) .",
    "we must , however be prepared to regard the vacuum  as a dielectric medium with unusual properties : lorentz invariant and with @xmath49 satisfying a driven klein - gordon equation .",
    "conventional dielectrics , however , are not dynamical but , rather , have properties which are local functions of the em field .",
    "we explored this possibility in this paper without letting go of lorentz invariance .",
    "the result is a theory with _",
    "formal _ analogies to torsion in the einstein - cartan - sciama - kibble theory of gravity .",
    "if the connection and metric are to be seen as independent degrees of freedom , then torsion is inevitable , but it appears as a non - dynamical degree of freedom , algebraically related to the spin - density .",
    "here we find an algebraic relation between @xmath49 and the em lagrangian . in both cases",
    "it is extremely difficult to constrain the ensuing theory .",
    "nonetheless the theory leads to interesting results . at a very fundamental level",
    "it could change the outlook on the problem of the divergence of the self - energy of particles , as we have shown in section  [ self ] .",
    "it also leads to interesting early universe cosmologies , with simple choices for the potential inducing bounces , loitering and acceleration .",
    "the dynamics is fundamentally different from that found in bsbm , because the conservation equation must be modified so as to obtain a closed system of governing equations .",
    "the late - time implications are likely to be less dramatic . with a quadratic potential the effects",
    "are suppressed by factors @xmath165 and so are naturally small ( one can easily adapt the calculations in section  [ massv ] to a late - time matter universe ) . with an exponential potential we obtain tracking solutions , just as with quintessence , but these induce a shift in the equation of state .",
    "we should therefore either ensure that for dark matter the constant @xmath166 is small , or else induce a feature in the potential ( i.e. a local minimum ) taking the field away from rolling behaviour at late - times .",
    "further extensions of this theory are possible .",
    "we may regard bsbm as a purely kinetic  varying - alpha theory ( in which the lagrangian for @xmath36 only has a kinetic term ) .",
    "by contrast , the theory proposed here is endowed with a lagrangian with only a potential term , leading to an algebraic relation between @xmath4 and em field .",
    "we could of course have both a kinetic and a potential term , but such a theory would ontologically be more like a bsbm theory , where @xmath36 is a truly dynamical field .",
    "quantitative differences would arise , and one suspects that scaling solutions similar to those found in the quintessence scenario would exist .",
    "a more dramatic possible generalisation of these theories would arise from giving up lorentz symmetry .",
    "then a much larger class of theories can be written down , with a richer phenomenology .",
    "we are currently exploring this possibility .",

    "<S> unlike normal dielectrics , such a medium can not change the speed of light , and its dynamics obey a klein - gordon equation . </S>",
    "<S> this work immediately suggests an extension of the standard theory , even if we require compliance with lorentz invariance . instead of a wave equation , the dynamics may satisfy a local algebraic relation involving the permittivity and the properties of the electromagnetic field , in analogy with more conventional dielectric ( but still preserving lorentz invariance ) . </S>",
    "<S> we develop the formalism for such theories and investigate some phenomenological implications . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of the divergence of the classical self - energy can be solved , or at least softened , in this framework . some interesting new cosmological solutions for the very early universe </S>",
    "<S> are found , including the possibility of a bounce , inflation and expansion with a loitering phase , all of which are induced by early variations in alpha . </S>"
