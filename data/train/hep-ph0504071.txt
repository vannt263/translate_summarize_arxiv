    "a major effort of the @xmath7-physics community is underway to map out the apex of the unitarity triangle , which provides a graphical representation of the effect of cp violation in the quark flavor sector of the standard model .",
    "one of the biggest successes of this endeavor was the precise determination of the angle @xmath11 , which has been measured with high accuracy from the time - dependent cp asymmetry in the @xmath12 decay channel @xcite .",
    "the length of the side opposite the angle @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "a high - precision determination of this quantity would enable us to test the validity of the standard model and search for possible deviations from its predictions .",
    "good theoretical knowledge of strong - interaction effects in weak decays of @xmath7 mesons is crucial for a reliable exploration of the flavor sector of the standard model . in particular , the determination of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xmath13 and @xmath5 relies on an accurate description of bound - state effects in semileptonic decays . at present ,",
    "the most precise calculations are available for inclusive semileptonic decays @xmath14 .",
    "the theoretical tools for the calculation of inclusive @xmath7 decays are qcd factorization on the one hand @xcite , and local operator product expansions ( ope ) on the other @xcite .",
    "both approaches perform a systematic separation of long - distance hadronic quantities from short - distance perturbative ones , while organizing the calculation in inverse powers of the heavy @xmath3-quark mass @xmath4 .",
    "the ope is an appropriate tool for the calculation of total inclusive rates ( for example in @xmath15 decay ) or for partial rates integrated over sufficiently large regions in phase space , where all components of the final - state hadronic momentum @xmath16 are large compared to @xmath17 .",
    "qcd factorization , on the other hand , is better suited for the calculation of partial rates and spectra near kinematical boundaries , where typically some components of @xmath16 are large , while the invariant hadronic mass @xmath18 is small .",
    "for example , any @xmath0 event can be described with three independent kinematical variables , a useful choice of which is @xcite @xmath19 here @xmath20 are the light - cone components of the hadronic final - state momentum along the jet direction , @xmath21 is the charged - lepton energy , @xmath22 is the jet energy , and @xmath23 is the jet momentum , all measured in the @xmath7-meson rest frame .",
    "the phase space for these variables is @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the mass of the lightest possible hadronic final state .",
    "the product @xmath26 is the hadronic invariant mass squared . in order to avoid large backgrounds from @xmath27 transitions , all measurements of @xmath5 are in one way or another restricted to the region of phase space where @xmath28 .",
    "if the quantity @xmath29 takes values near its maximum at @xmath2 , then @xmath30 is restricted to a region of order @xmath31 , which is numerically comparable to @xmath17 .",
    "this means that there are three parametrically different energy scales in the problem : the mass @xmath2 of the initial state , the mass of the final hadronic state @xmath32 , and the low scale @xmath17 at which perturbation theory breaks down and hadronic physics must be parameterized in terms of non - perturbative matrix elements .",
    "qcd factorization disentangles the effects from these scales , so that the perturbative contributions can be expanded in powers of @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( giving rise to `` hard functions '' ) and @xmath35 with @xmath36 ( giving rise to `` jet functions '' ) .",
    "it is important to note that the heavy - quark expansions valid in these two kinematical regions are not identical , because the power counting rules differ in the two regimes .",
    "also the nature of the non - perturbative inputs is different . in the ope region ,",
    "non - perturbative physics is encoded in a few hadronic parameters , and the heavy - quark expansion is the usual wilsonian expansion in local operators . in the endpoint ( or shape - function ) region ,",
    "the presence of multiple scales complicates the power counting , and the interplay between soft and collinear modes gives rise to large non - localities . as a result , non - perturbative physics is described by hadronic structure functions called `` shape functions '' , and the heavy - quark expansion is an expansion in non - local string operators defined on the light - cone .",
    "the connections between the two regimes is that _ moments _ of the shape functions can be expressed in terms of local operators .",
    "the goal of the present work is to develop a formalism that smoothly interpolates between the two kinematical regimes ( see @xcite for a related discussion , which is however restricted to the tree approximation ) .",
    "this is essential for building an event generator for inclusive @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays , which can be used to study partial and differential decay rates in different kinematical domains . in the shape - function region ,",
    "our approach relies on exact qcd factorization theorems , which exist in every order of power counting .",
    "they allow us to systematically disentangle short- and long - distance physics and , in the process , resum parametrically large logarithms order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "this factorization can be done with high accuracy for the terms of leading power in @xmath37 , and with somewhat less sophistication for the first - order power corrections . for the second - order power corrections , we only include contributions that do not vanish when integrated over all phase space .",
    "this is a safe approximation ; the effects of the remaining @xmath38 terms can to a large extent be absorbed by a redefinition of the subleading shape functions arising at order @xmath37 .",
    "our formalism is `` optimized '' for the shape - function region in the sense that sophisticated theoretical technology is applied in this regime .",
    "however , when our expressions for the differential decay rates are integrated over sufficiently wide domains , they automatically reduce to the simpler results that can be derived using the ope approach , up to yet unknown terms of @xmath6 .",
    "the moment relations for the shape functions are crucial in this context .",
    "note that local @xmath38 corrections in the ope receive contributions from terms of leading power ( @xmath39 ) , subleading power ( @xmath37 ) , and sub - subleading power ( @xmath38 ) in the shape - function region , so the transition is highly non - trivial . in implementing the program outlined here",
    ", we include all presently known information on the triple differential @xmath0 decay rate and on the differential @xmath1 decay rate in a single , unified framework .",
    "we neglect , for simplicity , hadronic power corrections of order @xmath40 and higher , which are known to have a negligible effect on the observables considered here .",
    "the only possible exception is contributions from `` weak annihilation '' , which are estimated as part of our error analysis .",
    "we also ignore the existing results on @xmath41 radiative corrections for some single - differential distributions , because the corresponding corrections are not known for the double or triple differential @xmath0 decay spectra .",
    "while these @xmath41 terms are sometimes found to be large when naive perturbation theory in @xmath42 is used , their effects are expected to be small in our scheme , which is based on a complete scale separation using qcd factorization .",
    "we see no reason why the @xmath43 terms should be enhanced compared to other , unknown corrections of @xmath6 .    a technical complication in realizing the approach described here has to do with the treatment of phase - space factors .",
    "the heavy - quark expansion of the hadronic tensor for @xmath0 decay gives rise to expressions that are singular at certain points in phase space .",
    "one way to avoid these singularities is to also expand phase - space factors order by order in @xmath37 ( see , e.g. , the treatment in @xcite ) . however , since this expansion depends on the kinematical cuts of any given analysis , it can not be implemented in a straightforward way in an event generator .",
    "an alternative is to reorganize the heavy - quark expansion in such a way that the expansion parameter is related to _",
    "( as opposed to partonic ) kinematical variables , in which case kinematical singularities are always canceled by exact phase - space factors . following this strategy ,",
    "we obtain expressions for decay distributions and partial decay rates which are free of explicit reference to partonic quantities such as the @xmath3-quark mass .",
    "a dependence on @xmath4 enters only implicitly via the first moment of the leading - order shape function @xmath44 .",
    "the philosophy of our approach is that this function by the combination of leading and subleading shape functions contributing to @xmath1 decay , and we will use the same function to make predictions for @xmath0 decay distributions .",
    "] is extracted experimentally from a fit to the @xmath1 photon spectrum , which has been measured with good precision in the region where @xmath45 .",
    "this is analogous to the extraction of parton distribution functions from deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the photon spectrum is experimentally accessible to energies as low as 1.8gev , which corresponds to a sampling of the shape function for values of @xmath46 up to about 1.7gev .",
    "once the shape function has been extracted over this range , we can use it to obtain predictions for arbitrary partial @xmath0 decay rates with cuts . in doing so",
    ", the residual hadronic uncertainties in the extraction of @xmath5 only enter at the level of power corrections .",
    "we emphasize that the program outlined above is equivalent to an approach put forward in @xcite and later refined in @xcite , in which @xmath5 is extracted with the help of shape - function independent relations between weighted integrals over differential decay distributions in @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the experimental error in the results for these weighted integrals corresponds , in our approach , to the error in the prediction of @xmath0 partial rates resulting from the experimental uncertainty in the extraction of the shape function from the @xmath1 photon spectrum .",
    "while the shape - function independent relations are very elegant , it is more convenient for the construction of a generator to have a formulation where the shape function is used as an input . in this way , it is possible to impose arbitrary cuts on kinematical variables without having to recompute the weight functions in each case .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : bsgamma ] we collect the relevant formulae for the calculation of the @xmath1 photon spectrum .",
    "these expressions can be used to extract the leading non - perturbative structure function from experiment .",
    "an analogous presentation for the triple differential decay rate in @xmath0 decays is presented in section  [ sec : bulnu ] . in order to perform a numerical analysis one needs to rely on parameterizations of the shape functions .",
    "a collection of several useful functional forms is given in section  [ sec : strucfunc ] . in section  [ sec : analysio ] we present a full error analysis of partial @xmath0 decay rates for a variety of experimental cuts .",
    "we also explore the sensitivity of the results to the @xmath3-quark mass and to the functional forms adopted for the shape functions .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the decay process @xmath47 , while more complex in its short - distance physics , is considerably simpler in its kinematics than the semileptonic process @xmath0 .",
    "since the radiated photon is on - shell , the hadronic variables @xmath20 that describe the momentum of the @xmath48 system are trivially related to the photon energy @xmath49 by @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in the crudest approximation , namely at tree level and leading power , the photon - energy spectrum is directly proportional to the leading shape function , @xmath52 . in this section we collect all relevant formulae needed to compute the @xmath1 photon spectrum or , equivalently , the invariant hadronic mass distribution .",
    "it is implicitly assumed that these spectra are sufficiently `` smeared '' ( e.g. , by experimental resolution ) to wash out any sharp hadronic structures . in cases where the resolution is such that the @xmath53 resonance peak is observed , it can be accounted for by combining the formulae in this section with the prescription for subtracting the @xmath54 peak proposed in @xcite .    the differential @xmath1 decay rate can be written as @xmath55 ^ 2\\,u(\\mu_h,\\mu_i)\\,\\f_\\gamma(p_+ ) \\,,\\ ] ] where the structure function @xmath56 depends on the photon energy via @xmath57 .",
    "the prefactor contains the electromagnetic fine - structure constant @xmath58 normalized at @xmath59 , two powers of the running @xmath3-quark mass ( defined in the @xmath60 scheme ) originating from the electromagnetic dipole operator @xmath61 in the effective weak hamiltonian , and the square of the corresponding wilson coefficient @xmath62 , which is needed at next - to - leading order in renormalization - group improved perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "renormalization - group running from the hard scale @xmath63 to the intermediate scale @xmath64 gives rise to the evolution factor @xmath65 , whose explicit form is discussed in appendix  [ apx : sudakovs ] .",
    "we keep @xmath66 and @xmath67 outside of the structure function @xmath56 ; it is understood that when combining the various terms in ( [ bsg : general ] ) all perturbative quantities should be expanded for consistency to the required order in @xmath68 .",
    "at leading order in @xmath37 the structure function @xmath56 factorizes as @xcite @xmath69 at this order a single non - perturbative parton distribution function arises , called the leading shape function @xcite and denoted by @xmath70 .",
    "our notation is adopted from @xcite : hatted shape functions have support for @xmath71 . the function @xmath72 is defined in terms of a non - local matrix element in heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "renormalization - group running between the intermediate scale and a low hadronic scale is avoided when using the shape functions renormalized at the intermediate scale @xmath73 .",

    "it is broader , steeper at the onset , faster to fall off , and the maximum is shifted toward larger @xmath46 .",
    "an important comment is that , once a two - parameter ansatz is employed , the shape - function parameters ( i.e. , @xmath4 and @xmath278 ) can either be determined from a fit to the entire photon spectrum , or to the first two moments of the spectrum .",
    "both methods are equivalent and should yield consistent results .",
    "if they do not , it would be necessary to refine the ansatz for the functional form of the shape function .    in most applications shape functions are needed for arguments @xmath46 of order @xmath17 .",

    "we obtain a continuous shape - function model with the correct asymptotic behavior .",
    "we stress that for applications with a maximal @xmath30 not larger than about 1.6gev the radiative tail of the shape function is never required .",
    "this includes all methods for extracting @xmath5 discussed later in this work , except for the case of a cut on hadronic invariant mass , @xmath321 , if @xmath322 is above 1.6gev .      in the last section",
    "we have been guided by the fact that the @xmath1 photon spectrum is at leading power directly determined by the leading shape function .",

    "the available information is limited to the tree - level moment relations ( [ ssf : moments ] ) , stating that the norms of the subleading shape functions vanish while their first moments do not . in @xcite ,",
    "two classes of models have been proposed , in which the subleading shape functions are `` derived '' from the leading shape function .",
    "a particularly simple choice is @xmath323 below , we will sometimes refer to this set of functions as the `` default choice '' .",
    "we choose the parameter @xmath324 in the expression for @xmath121 ( as well as in the expressions for the second - order hadronic power corrections ) to coincide with the quantity @xmath277 given in ( [ parsexp ] ) and ( [ parsgauss ] ) .",

    "the values for the parameters @xmath338 and @xmath339 should be chosen such that the following characteristics of subleading shape functions are respected : first , they are dimensionless functions , so that their values are naturally of @xmath198 for @xmath342 .",

    "only when the differential distributions are integrated over a sufficiently large region in phase space , global quark - hadron duality ensures that the partonic description used in the present work matches the true , hadronic distributions with good accuracy . a more ambitious goal would be to calculate the differential decay rate point by point in the @xmath200 plane .",

    "we will find that in all cases of interest the first two terms give an excellent approximation to the exact result for @xmath362 .    for the purpose of illustration",
    ", we adopt the exponential model for the shape function and present numerical results for two sets of input parameters , which are biased by the results deduced from fits to @xmath15 moments @xcite .",
    "specifically , we use @xmath308gev , @xmath358gev@xmath143 ( set  1 ) and @xmath363gev , @xmath364gev@xmath143 ( set  2 ) .",
    "the values of the @xmath3-quark mass coincide with those obtained at two - loop and one - loop order in @xcite ( see also the discussion below ) , while the values of @xmath278 are close to the corresponding values in that reference .",
    "as was mentioned before , in the future the leading shape function @xmath289 should be extracted from a fit to the @xmath1 photon spectrum , in which case the uncertainty in its shape becomes an experimental error , which can be systematically reduced with improved data . in the process ,",
    "the `` theoretically preferred '' parameter values used in the present work will be replaced with the `` true '' values extracted directly from data . while this will change the central values for the partial rates , our estimates of the theoretical errors will only be affected marginally .",
    "the different sources of theoretical uncertainties are as follows : first , there are uncertainties associated with the functional forms of the subleading shape functions .",
    "to estimate them , we take the spread of results obtained when using the large set of different models described in section  [ sec : modelssf ] , while the central value for a partial decay rate corresponds to the default model ( [ ssf : model1 ] ) . secondly , there are perturbative uncertainties associated with the choice of the matching scales @xmath85 , @xmath73 , and @xmath97 .",
    "decay rates are formally independent of these scales , but a residual dependence remains because of the truncation of the perturbative series .",
    "our error analysis is as follows :    * the hard scale @xmath85 is of order @xmath4 . in perturbative logarithms",
    "the scale appears in the combination @xmath365 , see e.g.  ( [ eq : leadhardfunction ] ) . to set a central value for @xmath85 we are guided by the average @xmath366 .",
    "the leading term for the double differential decay rate @xmath367 is proportional to @xmath368 .",
    "it follows that the average @xmath181 on the interval @xmath369 $ ] is 0.7 . however , in some applications @xmath181 is not integrated over the full domain .",
    "also , there are large negative constants in the matching correction @xmath370 in ( [ eq : leadhardfunction ] ) , whose effect can be ameliorated by lowering the scale further . in the error analysis we use the central value of @xmath371gev and",
    "vary the scale by a factor between @xmath372 and @xmath373 . for the central value @xmath374 . *",
    "the intermediate scale @xmath375 serves as the renormalization point for the jet and shape functions .",
    "we fix this scale to @xmath376gev .",
    "variations of @xmath73 would affect both the normalization and the functional form of the shape function , as determined by the solution to the renormalization - group equation for the shape function discussed in @xcite .",
    "in practice , effects on the shape are irrelevant because the shape function is fitted to data . the only place where the intermediate scale has a direct impact on the extraction of @xmath5 is through the normalization of the shape function ( [ sfnorm ] ) . in the analysis we therefore estimate the uncertainty by assigning the value @xmath377 as a relative error , where @xmath378 . *",
    "the scale @xmath97 appears as the argument of @xmath68 in the perturbative contributions @xmath362 .",
    "we vary @xmath97 from @xmath379 to @xmath380 with the central value @xmath381gev .",
    "these three errors are added in quadrature and assigned as the total perturbative uncertainty .",
    "finally , we need to estimate the effects from higher - dimensional operators at third and higher - order in power counting .",
    "if the considered cut includes the region of phase space near the origin ( @xmath382 ) , then the dominant such contributions are weak annihilation effects , which we have discussed in section  [ sec : wa ] . from the analysis in @xcite one",
    "can derive a bound on the weak annihilation contribution that is @xmath3831.8% of the total decay rate , for which we take @xmath384 ( see below ) . the resulting uncertainty @xmath385 affects all partial rates which include the region near the origin in the @xmath200 plane .",
    "the uncertainty from weak annihilation can be avoided by imposing a cut @xmath260 ( see section  [ sec : eliminatewa ] ) . for all observables considered in the present work , other power corrections of order @xmath40 can be safely neglected .",
    "this can be seen by multiplying the contributions from second - order hadronic power corrections to the various decay rates ( called @xmath386 ) by an additional suppression factor @xmath387 .",
    "the following subsection contains a discussion of the total decay rate . in the remainder of this section we then present predictions for a variety of kinematical cuts designed to eliminate ( or reduce ) the charm background .",
