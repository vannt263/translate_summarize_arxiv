    "one such approach is based on electroweak instanton - induced processes where there is interaction between cosmogenic neutrinos and the nucleons in the atmosphere .",
    "such a process , which was proposed by ringwald @xcite and bezrukov et al @xcite violates the baryon+lepton number , b + l. other approaches include production of miniature black holes in ultra - relativistic collisions with energies above the fundamental planck scale @xmath14 @xmath15 @xcite , neutrino interactions through tev string resonance processes with string scale @xmath16 @xcite , production of quasi - stable charged sleptons ( staus ) predicted by weak scale supersymmetric models with the supersymmetry breaking scale greater than @xmath17 gev @xcite .",

    "similarly , the evolution equations for parton densities and fragmentation functions in perturbative qcd can have numerical solution with the help of the qcdnum program , which is powerful to evove un - polarised parton densities upto nnlo in powers of the strong coupling constant @xmath18 . precision studies of the nnlo dglap evolution at the lhc can be carried out with programme candia ( progrmming language c and fortran)@xcite .",

    "it is interesting to see whether the analytical solutions deviate at all from the exact numerical solutions and if so , to what extent .    in recent years , an approximate method @xcite to solve dglap equations @xcite has been pursued with considerable phenomenological success . in that approach , we have used taylor series expansion to express these equations as partial differential equations in @xmath12 @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 , valid at low @xmath12 .",

    "extensive extrapolation @xcite is then carried out to determine the parton densities from the ( @xmath12 , @xmath46 ) domain of terrestrial accelerator hera to the ultrasmall values of bjorken @xmath12 , where there is no data .",
    "but unfortunately , this type of extrapolation brings about some uncertainties in the estimated uhe neutrino - nucleon cross - sections @xcite measured with the help of neutrino telescopes .",
    "this is because we are not so sure about what is happening in the region @xmath194 and our ignorance forces us to take different assumtions ( or educated guesses ) about the behaviour of the distribution functions at ultra - small @xmath12 , leading to the large variations of different evaluated cross - sections .",
    "as an example of the first approach , we can mention the case of gandhi et al @xcite who used cteq3 and cteq4 parton distributions @xcite and mrs parton distrbutions @xcite ( mrs @xmath195 and @xmath196 ) to determine the charged current cross - section @xmath197 and the neutral current cross - section @xmath198 . on the other hand , in the second approach , gluck , kretzer and reya @xcite applied qcd - inspired radiative parton model @xcite to evaluate parton densities directly for @xmath199 .",
    "the model utilizes the principle of qcd dynamics to extrapolate parton densities to kinematical regions as yet unexplored by the present day terrestrial experiment and to go for respective fits .",
    "parton densities obtained within the framework of this model only are claimed to be free from the ambiguity of the earlier approach .",
    "here one calculates the parton densities in the region @xmath194 by the direct application of qcd dynamics , without introducing any fit parameter in that region . it may be mentioned that though mrs and cteq parametrisations do not work at all for values of @xmath12 below @xmath200 , but grv parametrisation works well for values of @xmath12 upto @xmath201 @xcite .    at ultra - low bjorken @xmath12 , sea quarks will hugely multiply in a dominating way and these arise from gluon splitting into quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "so the technique of gluon extrapolation will provide one a direction to carry out sea quark extrapolation .",
    "if the gluon extrapolation is carried out at some input value @xmath202 in the following way @xcite , @xmath203 then at higher values of @xmath96 , we can extrapolate gluons similarly @xmath204 we can extrapolate sea quarks in a similar approach @xcite @xmath205 one can determine @xmath170 from the pdfs at @xmath206 for each flavor .",
    "it is pertinent to know that we have developed our formalism in this paper in leading order only , so we will use lo parton densities in this case . in case of nlo , one has to use nlo parton densities strictly , with the appropriate addition of convolutions with the fermionic wilson coefficient @xmath207 and the nlo contribution @xmath208 @xcite , though these additional contributions never provide more than 2% contributions @xcite .        as a simplified case , we have not gone for small @xmath12 extrapolation in this paper with the assumption that there is not too much remarkable difference between the extrapolated and the non - extrapolated results .",
    "the two detector collaborations h1 and zeus at hera at desy in hamburg recorded integrated luminosity of 1 @xmath209 from may to october , 1993 .",
    "the amount was twenty times the luminosity that was recorded in 1992 during its run for the first time , where the energy of the electron beam was 26.7 gev @xcite . in 1993 , energy of the electrons was raised to 27.5 gev , which were allowed to collide with 820 gev protons , where the centre of mass energy ( @xmath210 ) was around 300 gev . from july 18 , 1994 ,",
    "electron beam was replaced by positron beam due to the limitation imposed by the lifetime of the electron beam @xcite . in the hera ii phase in 2000 - 2001 ,",
    "the collider as well as experiments were upgraded and consequently 920 gev proton beam was allowed to collide with 27.6 gev electron / positron beam with the centre - of - mass energy 319 gev and integrated luminosity around 150 @xmath209 @xcite .",
    "recent results from hera shows h1 luminosity as 181 @xmath209 in @xmath211 and 294 @xmath209 in @xmath212 scatterings respectively @xcite .    on the basis of data collected by h1 and zeus ,",
    "the neutral and charged current cross - sections were calculated during the hera i phase ( 1994 - 2000 ) and was found to coincide nicely with the electroweak standard model predictions based on cteq6d parton density functions @xcite as revealed in figure [ fig : raman ] .    from neutrino - nucleon scattering experiments in the eighties ,",
    "weak charged currents were studied , where it was found that the cross - section is directly proportional to neutrino energy @xcite .",
    "this linear behaviour of cross - section clearly pinpoints the fact that the sensivity of the neutrino energy to the @xmath213 propagator effect is extremely small and hence negligible .",
    "the field of electroweak physics was opened for the first time when charged current reaction @xmath214 was studied at hera , where the role of @xmath213 propagator became important becauge of the high momentum transfer comparable to @xmath215 and the equivalent fixed target energy of the hera collider was 50 tev .",
    "since this process is just the inverse of neutrino - nucleon scattering , the measured @xmath216 cross - section could easily be converted into an equivalent @xmath110 cross - section at 50 tev @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this value of equivalent cross - section comes very close to the value of cross - section as predicted by gandhi et al in the recent past . in figure",
    "[ fig : meghnad ] , low energy neutrino data has been represented by the crosses , whereas the full and open stars represents the equivalent @xmath110 cross - section as obtained from the hera experiment .",
    "the extrapolation from low energies has produced the straight line at higher and higher energies assuming @xmath217 , but when the effect of @xmath213 propagator is considered , one gets the bent curve which represents the predicted cross - section .",

    "the ratio obtained from ref @xcite ( magenta coloured dash dot line ) is compared with our analytical and numerical results ( table [ table : ch6tab8 ] ) .",
    "let us make a comparative study of the figures ( [ fig : ch6fig1]-[fig : ch6fig6 ] ) .",
    "as expected and clearly demonstrated in these figures , our analytical result indicates a sharp rise for @xmath497 gev .",
    "this is due to the absence of propagator effect in low energy regime @xcite . for @xmath498 gev ,",
    "the dampening due to the propagator effect takes place .",
    "here we find our numerically determined result in sufficient agreement with the results obtained by the above - mentioned authors @xcite .",
    "as far as our analytical result is concerned , we find it to match better with other results at lower end of the energy spectrum ( @xmath499 ) of the uhe neutrino rather than the higher end ( @xmath500 ) . at the higher end , we observe dampening of the cross - section than what is expected from the other numerical results etc . mentioned beforehand .",
    "the quantitative difference at the higher end is presumably due to the following factors :    \\(1 ) we have not extrapolated mrst distribution for values of @xmath12 below @xmath200 , assuming that our approximate analytical solutions of dglap equations for singlet structure function @xmath501 as well as non - singlet structure function @xmath118 remains valid in the uhe regime .",
    "\\(2 ) we have considered solutions at tree level . replacing lo distributions by nlo distributions and with the appropriate addition of convolutions with the fermionic wilson coefficient @xmath207 and the nlo contribution @xmath208 @xcite , we may expect somewhat better results .",
    "\\(3 ) we have neglected the finite @xmath12 corrections coming from the higher derivatives of @xmath502 in taylor approximation of dglap equations in case of @xmath20-evolution of @xmath118 at one loop level @xcite . similarly , we have neglected the finite @xmath12 corrections coming from the higher derivatives of @xmath503 and @xmath504 in taylor approximation of dglap equations in case of @xmath20-evolution of @xmath267 at one loop level @xcite .",
    "\\(4 ) we have considered the contribution due to light quarks only and neglected the contribution due to heavy quarks . for @xmath505 gev , preferably for @xmath506 gev , nlo massive @xmath507 contribution will introduce an @xmath102 correction of about 20% to the lo contribution of @xmath508 .",
    "we find that the blue coloured dashed line drawn on the basis of our numerical method has got the almost same slope as that of the other lines drawn on the basis other numerical methods as seen in figures ( [ fig : ch6fig1]-[fig : ch6fig4 ] ) , proving the excellence of our numerical results .",
    "a little lateral shift is presumably because of the following reasons :    \\(1 ) we have done calculations at leading order involving lo parton distributions , whereas the calculations done by other authors at next - to - leading order are based on nlo parton distributions .",
    "obviously a better result is expected at nnlo level .",
    "\\(2 ) it has been found that there had been a @xmath509 discrepancies between grv 94 distribution @xcite adopted by us for numerical calculation and the precision measurements at hera done at a later stage ( in 1996 and 1997 ) .",
    "this implies that grv 94 distribution has restricted accuracy margin .",
    "so gluck et al realised the necessity of the fine tuning of the input parameter @xmath510 and/or @xmath511 both at lo and nlo level which they did and removed these @xmath509 discrepencies by providing the grv 98 parton distributions @xcite .",
    "it is pertinent to remind that nlo calculations of gluck et al were based mainly on grv 98 parton distributions , which was almost free from any uncertainty of radiative predictions because of timely fine tuning .",
    "for example , they fine - tuned @xmath512 from the value @xmath513 gev@xmath514 to @xmath515 gev@xmath514 at one loop level .",
    "similarly there was a fine tuning at two loop level from from the value @xmath516 gev@xmath514 to @xmath517 gev@xmath514 @xcite .",
    "\\(3 ) grv 94 predictions adopted by us are valid in the small @xmath12 region @xmath518 .",
    "we did our numerical calculations assuming the validity of these distributions in the uhe regime i.e. @xmath519 , which is obviously not true .",
    "uncertainty and error are definite to crop up ( however small it may be ) due to the this non - extrapolation .",
    "it is reminded that gluck et al later extended their perturbatively stable parameter ",
    "free dynamical predictions to the extremely small-@xmath12 region @xmath520 @xcite .",

    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite are already known .",
    "this is shown in table [ table : ch6tab12345 ] @xcite .",
    "such an upper bound arises due to non - observation of events triggered off by uhe neutrinos as reported by rice and agasa .",
    "we compare our analytical as well as numerically determined results for the ultra high energy neutrino - nucleon cross - section in leading order with the above - mentioned upper bounds at three different neutrino energies @xmath521 gev .",
    "we find that our results do not violate the experimental upper bounds imposed on the neutrino - nucleon interaction cross - section and are well within it as clearly seen in table [ table : ch6tab12345 ] and table [ table : ch6tab10100 ] . in table",
    "[ table : ch6tabgermany ] , sensitivity of pierre auger observatory ( pao ) at 95% confidence limit in @xmath522 is shown @xcite .",
    "this has been derived with the assumption that no deeply developing showers above standard model background has been observed in 5 years of operation .",
    "this can be compared with the results given in table [ table : ch6tab10100 ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : trombay ] , we plot our analytical result ( wine coloured dot line ) and numerical ( exact ) result ( magenta coloured dash dot line ) for neutrino - nucleon cross - section derived from standard model .",
    "this is compared with the upper bounds on the neutrino - nucleon cross - sections derived from the rice collaboration search results by exploiting the cosmogenic neutrino flux estimates of fkrt @xcite ( red coloured solid line ) and pj @xcite ( blue coloured dash line ) .      as per beyond the standard model scenario , neutrinos with energies around @xmath440 gev",
    "may behave as strongly interacting as protons , which has the capacity of inducing vertical air showers at high altitudes in the atmosphere .",
    "since there is a good match of cosmogenic neutrino flux with the uhe cosmic ray spectrum above greison - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) energy ( @xmath523 gev ) , so one can appreciate this strongly interacting characteristics of cosmogenic neutrinos which can solve the gzk puzzle .",
    "if the strongly interacting neutrino scenario is considered for @xmath524 gev , which leads to the generation of vertical showers , then non - observation of quasi - horizontal air showers by agasa would not be able to constrain the neutrino - nucleon cross - section the way it did .",
    "to conclude , we have shown that our analytical evaluation of neutrino(antineutrino)-nucleon cross - section tallies well in selected part of of the neutrino(antineutrino ) energy spectrum .",
    "particularly it tallies well with the result obtained at the lower end of the energy spectrum , but at the higher end there is dampening much more than what is expected due to propagator effect in case of numerical solutions by other authors @xcite .",
    "the reason for such differences at higher end of the neutrino(antineutrino ) energy spectrum has been explained in subsection [ ch6:comparative study and limitations ] . on the other hand , our lo numerical result tallies quite well with the nlo results of other authors both at the lower as well as higher ends of the neutrino(antineutrino ) energy spectrum .",
