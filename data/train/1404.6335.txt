    "this experimental evidence is of crucial importance as the commonly accepted notion of independence for a stirrer position is just defined by the @xmath0 threshold crossing of the autocorrelation coefficient . even though it brings about a simple and effective criterion",

    ", an alternative way of evaluating the number of uncorrelated positions of mechanical mode - stirrers is based on the calculation of the correlation matrix through a grid of @xmath4 spatial points , selected among an arbitrary volume of the chamber @xcite .",
    "another recent application of the correlation matrix involves single - point measurements through a wide frequency and to evaluate `` uncorrelated frequencies '' rather than spatial points @xcite .",
    "this way proves more fast and efficient as populating spatial correlation matrix requires for a large amount of field / power measurements .",
    "hybrid techniques can also be conceived based on the correlation matrix .",
    "spatial point and frequency point data can be combined to check stirring performance .    in this work",
    "we review existing multivariate strategies grounded on the correlation matrix that are important to assess rc performances .",
    "the typical framework we use to test different performance indicators is a reverberation chamber equipped with a `` carousel '' mode - stirrer @xcite .",

    "recently , the concept of multi - resolution for the construction of correlation matrices in mtrc is attracting the interest of the scientific community @xcite    the definition of independent stirrer positions based on a multivariate field perspective has been pioneered in @xcite . in @xcite , the number of uncorrelated positions are related to the number of independent eigenvalues of the correlation matrix @xmath12 . in particular , @xmath12 is populated by pearson correlation coefficients ( pcc ) .",

    "a similar philosophy is adopted in @xcite where the concern is the number of uncorrelated measurements rather than stirrer positions .",
    "the measurement correlation has been defined in terms of the maximum reny entropy , again based on the eigenvalue of the correlation matrix . in particular , given the maximum entropy achievable through @xmath2 measurements @xmath16 it is straightforward to have an estimation of the number of uncorrelated measurements reading @xmath17 since @xmath18 can be calculated from the eigenvalues of @xmath12 , then @xmath19 the analogies between between ( [ eqn : meff_eigen ] ) and ( [ eqn : n_tracer ] ) are many , and essentially they constitute the same formula achieved through different perspectives @xcite .",
    "the advantage of ( [ eqn : meff_eigen ] ) is that the correlation matrix can be populated through a frequency scanning , i.e. , a frequency sampling would lead to @xmath20 as in @xcite , rather than the spatial scanning , leading to @xmath12 .",
    "it is worth remarking that the estimator ( [ eqn : n_tracer ] ) , used in different versions in @xcite and @xcite , is polarized , and the estimated number of uncorrelated positions @xmath15 , based on @xmath21 space / frequency points , is given by @xmath22 which converges to @xmath15 for a relatively high number of degrees of freedom @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : n_bias ] ) can be demonstrated by noting that the correlation matrix can be expanded in true principal components ( pc ) @xcite .",
    "inherently , it has been recently demonstrated that the rc field admits pc decomposition of the stirring process in empirical ( time - domain ) modes , called as `` eigenstirrings '' @xcite .",
    "therefore , ( [ eqn : n_bias ] ) can be also used to perform a systematic correction of the estimates if we make use of ( [ eqn : n_tracer ] ) to evaluate the number of effective stirrer positions with a few finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) lattice points @xcite .",
    "based on an entropic perspective , we can use ( [ eqn : meff_eigen ] ) to carry out the calculation of uncorrelated stirrer positions through either @xmath12 or @xmath20 .",
    "it has been already acknowledged that the production of entropy from scattering processes over finite regions of space is important to evaluate the degrees of freedom of a complex em system @xcite .",
    "a thorough study of the time - domain entropy generation in rc has been performed in @xcite , through numerical fdtd simulations of an actual rc , and the linear increase of entropy at early times was proven to saturate at the maxentr limit ( [ eqn : maxentr ] ) which converges to the high - frequency estimate .",
    "this behavior is typical of multi - component ( many - body ) complex systems and has been observed in quantum many - body systems operating in chaotic regime @xcite .",
    "a step forward has been carried out in @xcite through the evaluation of uncorrelated pairs in the correlation matrix .",
    "this method grasps on graph theory to estimate the number of uncorrelated stirrer positions .",
    "a graph is developed where each node corresponds to a stirrer position , and an arc is formed when the correlation between two positions @xmath24 satisfies the cutoff condition @xcite @xmath25_{ij } \\leq \\e^{-1 } \\left [ 1 - \\frac{7.22}{\\left ( n_s^2 \\right ) ^{0.64 } } \\right ] \\,\\ , .\\ ] ] equation ( [ eqn : impr_limit ] ) is an extension of the correlation threshold @xmath1 based on sampling theory .",
    "the author then uses standard algorithms to search for the so - called `` maximum clique '' of the graph , and identifies it as the maximum number of uncorrelated positions .",
    "the result is a graphical method to count the number of uncorrelated positions through a direct test of uncorrelated node pairs .",
    "the method in @xcite relies on a threshold , while the methods proposed in @xcite do not rely on it , i.e. , they can be classified as threshold - less .",
    "the presence of a threshold should not be taken necessarily as a limitation .",
    "actually , its physical significance will become clear in a random sampling perspective , where we imagine to populate @xmath26 with fluctuating elements .",
    "following this philosophy , we decided to introduce a generalized threshold - based procedure to estimate the number of uncorrelated positions , by exploiting information of an extended reverberation ( sub ) space rather than a single point .",
    "the generality of the method resides in the fact that the sampling over multiple spatial points / frequencies has been extended to an arbitrary reverberant subspace independently on the a - priori definition of a working volume , and beyond the orientation of the dut .",
    "the mathematical procedure is detailed in @xcite .",
    "the number of uncorrelated stirrer positions comes from counting the number of elements in @xmath26 that are below the threshold ( [ eqn : impr_limit ] ) .",
    "each element has the meaning of a correlation between two cavity sub - spaces ( calculated through a discrete space / frequency lattice @xcite generated from two different stirrer configurations .",
