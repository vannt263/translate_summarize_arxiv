    "a central topic in the study of tableaux and plane partition are their enumerative properties .",
    "the number of standard young tableaux ( syt ) is given by the famous hook - length formula of frame , robinson and thrall , a similar formula exists for shifted standard tableaux .",
    "however , most tableaux and posets in general do not have such nice enumerative properties , for example their main generalizations as skew tableaux are not counted by any product type formulas .    in this paper",
    "we find product formulas for special cases of a new type of tableaux and plane partitions , ones whose diagrams are not straight or shifted young diagrams of integer partitions .",
    "the diagrams in question are obtained by removing boxes from the north - east corners of a straight or shifted young diagram and we say that the shape has been truncated by the shape of the boxes removed .",
    "we discover formulas for the number of tableaux of specific truncated shapes : shifted staircase truncated by one box in theorem  [ thm1 ] , rectangle truncated by a staircase shape theorem  [ thm2 ] and rectangle truncated by a square minus a box in theorem  [ thm3 ] ; these are illustrated as @xmath0 the proofs rely on several steps of interpretations .",
    "plane partitions of truncated shapes are interpreted as ( tuples of ) ssyts , which translates the problem into specializations of sums of restricted schur functions .",
    "the number of standard tableaux is found as a polytope volume and then a certain limit of these specializations ( generating function for the corresponding plane partitions ) .",
    "the computations involve among others complex integration and the robinson - schensted - knuth correspondence .",
    "the consideration of these objects started after r.  adin and y.  roichman asked for a formula for the number of linear extensions of the poset of triangle - free triangulations , which are equivalent to standard tableaux of shifted straircase shape with upper right corner box removed , @xcite .",
    "we find and prove the formula in question , namely    [ thm1 ] the number of shifted standard tableaux of shape @xmath1 is equal to @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of shifted staircase tableaux of shape @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the @xmath6th catalan number .",
    "we also prove formulas for the cases of rectangles truncated by a staircase .",
    "[ thm2 ] the number of standard tableaux of truncated straight shape @xmath7 ( assume @xmath8 ) , is @xmath9 where @xmath10    [ thm3 ] the number of standard truncated tableaux of shape @xmath11 is @xmath12    we will also exhibit connections with boxed plane partitions , as the generating function we use is the same as the volume generating function for boxed plane partitions .    we should note that numerical data suggests there are almost no other truncated shapes with product - type formulas . we see this because the number of standard tableaux of a shape of size @xmath13 has very large prime factors ( e.g. on the order of @xmath14 ) even for small ( below 50 ) values of @xmath13 . for example , there does not seem to be a product type formula for the immediate generalizations of the shapes above , e.g. shifted truncated shape @xmath15 for @xmath16 , or rectangles truncated by squares minus a staircase @xmath17 .",
    "the lack of hypothetical general formulas prevents us from applying the usual , generally induction based , techniques used for proving the hook - length formulas enumerating standard young tableaux .",
    "it might be interesting to investigate what other properties of syts , besides product - form formulas , have analogues in tableaux of truncated shapes .",
    "the presence of such formulas might suggest connections to representation theory and/or combinatorial properties like rsk .",
    "while almost all other truncated shapes lack product - type formulas , it is conceivable that other closed form formulas , e.g. determinantal , could exist .    in @xcite adin , king and roichman",
    "have independently found a formula for the case of shifted staircase truncated by one box and rectangle truncated by a square minus a box by methods different from the methods developed here .",
    "we will review some basic facts and definitions from the classical theory of symmetric functions and young tableaux which will be used later in this paper .",
    "the full description of these facts , as well as proofs and much more can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an integer * partition * @xmath18 of @xmath13 is a weakly decreasing sequence of nonnegative integers @xmath19 which sum up to @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath20 . the length of @xmath18 , @xmath21 , denotes the number of parts of @xmath18 , in this case it is @xmath22 . partitions are depicted graphically as * young diagrams * , a left justified array of @xmath23boxes , such that row @xmath24 counted from the top has @xmath25 boxes . for example , if @xmath26 then @xmath27 and it s young diagram is",
    ". we will mean the young diagram of @xmath18 when we refer to @xmath18 as a shape .",
    "a * skew * partition ( and thus shape ) @xmath28 is the collection of boxes which belong to @xmath18 but not @xmath29 when drawn with coinciding top left corners . e.g.",
    "the diagram of @xmath30 is @xmath31 .    a * semi - standard young tableaux ( ssyt ) * of shape @xmath18 and type @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a filling of the boxes of the young diagram of @xmath18 with integers , such that the numbers weakly increase along each row and strictly decrease down each column , and there are exactly @xmath34 numbers equal to @xmath24 . a * standard young tableaux ( syt ) *",
    "is an ssyt of type @xmath35 . a plane partition of shape @xmath18 is a filling with nonnegative integers of the diagram of @xmath18 , such that the numbers decrease weakly along rows and down columns .",
    "the same definitions carry over verbatim when the shape is skew , i.e. @xmath28 .       using the results we have obtained so far about @xmath36 for various shapes @xmath37 we can state the following facts about the @xmath38 distribution of the truncated 3d diagrams . setting @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the formulae for @xmath36 from the section on truncated rectangles we get the following 2 results .      more generally , the volume generating function for plane partitions on @xmath41 , whose @xmath45th diagonal is fixed at a certain value @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath46,t[2,n - k+2],\\ldots)=\\mu$ ] , is derived as @xmath47 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "notice that @xmath29 encodes the positions of the unmatched triangles ( `` sticking out '' lozenges ) in the lozenge tiling interpretation .",
    "thus we have that @xmath51,\\ldots , t[k , n])=\\mu } q^{\\sum t[i , j ] } = q^{(n - k+1)|\\mu| } \\frac { \\prod_{0<i < j < n+1}(q^{\\mu_i+n - i } -q^{\\mu_j+n - j})}{\\prod_{0<i < j <",
