    "the results in this paper suggests that the iib matrix model singles out not only _ four dimensionality of spacetime _ but also _ more symmetric spacetime_. we hope this suggestion is one of general features of the iib matrix model .",

    "<S> in addition we develop a new approach to evaluate the amplitudes on fuzzy @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     the table [ tbl : wig ] shows that @xmath5 comes closer to @xmath6 as we increase @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> it seems a bit surprising that this approximation works so well . </S>",
    "<S> it will be clarified later why is the case . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that @xmath6 and @xmath5 are equal in the large @xmath7 and @xmath8 limit and that this approximation is exact in this limit .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover in the limit @xmath7 and @xmath9 the summations in ( [ fwig ] ) can be approximated by integrations . </S>",
    "<S> as an example let us focus on the case @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> after rescaling variables @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and so forth and taking the limit @xmath13 , we obtain ] @xmath14 where the wigner asymptotic estimate changes the 6j symbols as @xmath15 with @xmath16    we now understand why this is a good approximation . from ( [ f ] ) , we can observe that the leading contribution to @xmath17 comes from the uv regions , i.e. , @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> in such a region , ( [ wigest ] ) is certainly valid .    </S>",
    "<S> we can apply this approximation to @xmath19 cases as well . </S>",
    "<S> the novelty here is the appearance of the ratio @xmath20 : @xmath21 @xmath22 is symmetric under the exchange of @xmath23 with @xmath24 , which is consistent with the argument in the sub - section [ sec : tree1loop ] .    </S>",
    "<S> numerically we can check whether this approximation is valid or not . </S>",
    "<S> we perform the multiple integration ( [ fint ] ) twice analytically and eventually by monte - carlo integration@xcite@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown in fig.[fig : fr ] , which indicates this approximation is in good agreement with the method in the section [ subsec : intapprx ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we make a comment on the difference between the methods in the sections [ subsec : asymptotic ] and [ subsec : intapprx ] . </S>",
    "<S> the former method requires more machine power with increasing @xmath23 , while the latter does not in the fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : effactionvsr ] . ] . </S>",
    "<S> so it seems that the latter is more economical and gives better results .    </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that this approach can not applies to the @xmath3 background case , that is , @xmath25 case . </S>",
    "<S> setting @xmath26 , @xmath6 becomes@xcite @xmath27 rescaling variables @xmath28 and taking the large @xmath7 limit , we have @xmath29 the factor @xmath30 vanishes , while the integration part diverges because of the ir contributions , i.e. @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that ( [ f2d ] ) is ill - defined , so that the naive approximation is not valid for the case @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> this limitation can be explained from another point of view . in the @xmath26 case </S>",
    "<S> dominant contributions to @xmath6 comes from ir regions , which is to say , @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> in such a region ( [ wigest ] ) is no longer valid . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation can not be applied to @xmath3 background . in this case , however , 6j symbols are well - approximated by 3j symbols @xmath33      in this sub - section , we determine the structure of the effective action to all orders . by naive power counting </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the @xmath34-th loop contribution to be @xmath35 since we obtain a factor of @xmath36 from 6j symbols in the interaction vertices(see @xcite ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we also assume that the @xmath0 background breaks susy softly , and so that leading corrections of each @xmath34-th loop cancel . under this assumption </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the @xmath34-th loop contribution becomes @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact this order estimation is correct in the two loop corrections ( [ 2loop ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this argument allows us to define the t hooft coupling of @xmath38 gauge theory as @xmath39 to all orders and so that the @xmath40th loop contributions are @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above arguments give the effective action to all orders in terms of the t hooft coupling @xmath42 n n , \\label{effaction}\\\\ & & \\mbox{with } \\quad { \\tilde{h}}_4(r , \\lambda^2 ) =      { f(r ) \\over 2 } { \\lambda^2 \\over ( 2 \\pi)^2 } + o(\\lambda^4).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    our remaining task is to minimize the effective action in terms of @xmath43 , and @xmath44 or equivalently @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> we can fix the t hooft coupling @xmath46 by minimizing the effective action ( [ effaction ] ) independently of @xmath47 ( but dependent on @xmath23 ) . by solving @xmath48 for @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> we find , up to two loop level , @xmath49    then the effective action becomes @xmath50 this can be evaluated numerically in two ways , i.e. , the methods in the section [ subsec : asymptotic ] and [ subsec : intapprx ] ( fig.[fig : effactionvsr ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> : the solid circles are obtained by the method described in the section [ subsec : asymptotic ] , while the solid line is obtained by the method of the section [ subsec : intapprx].,height=302 ]    it is found from this figure that the @xmath51 configuration minimizes the effective action , which means that the configuration of the same size @xmath1 is favored over the different size configurations . </S>",
    "<S> also it is apparent from ( [ effaction ] ) that the case @xmath52 is favored . </S>",
    "<S> it is the most important result of this paper that the same size @xmath0 configuration with the @xmath53 gauge group is singled out by the iib matrix model . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the effective action blows up , as we decrease @xmath23 below @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this tendency is consistent with the result in @xcite , that is , the configuration of the 4d limit(@xmath51 ) is favored rather than that of the 2d limit(@xmath25 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we expect that higher order corrections do not change this result by the argument in @xcite . </S>"
