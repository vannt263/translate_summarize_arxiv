    "<S> we present a generalized langevin equation for the dynamics of interacting semiflexible polymer chains , undergoing slow cooperative dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated gaussian intermolecular center - of - mass and monomer potentials , wich enter the gle , are in quantitative agreement with computer simulation data . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed , short - time subdiffusive regime of the polymer mean - square displacements , emerges here from the competition between the intramolecular and the intermolecular mean - force potentials .    2 despite its intrinsic complexity </S>",
    "<S> , the dynamics of low molecular weight unentangled polymer fluids has been considered for a long time to be a well understood problem in polymer physics . </S>",
    "<S> it is commonly accepted that when the degree of polymerization , @xmath0 , does not exceed the entanglement value , @xmath1 , a molecule is free to diffuse in the liquid , and follows fickian dynamics . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the rouse approach successfully describes several key features of the polymer dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> these include the scaling with @xmath0 of the bulk viscosity and the single - chain diffusion coefficient @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the boltzmann constant , @xmath4 the temperature , and @xmath5 the monomer friction coefficient@xcite .    upon closer examination </S>",
    "<S> , however , the dynamics of unentangled polymer fluids still presents important unresolved questions . in the rouse theory , </S>",
    "<S> local intermolecular interactions are completely neglected ; the single chain dynamics is driven by intramolecular entropic restoring forces and segmental friction , while the dynamics of the surrounding chains provide a heat bath . in this description </S>",
    "<S> the polymer center of mass is free to diffuse following brownian dynamics , and the mean - square displacement is expected to scale linearly in time at all time scales . in reality , </S>",

    "<S> the range of the potential is the same as that of the correlation hole@xcite in the pair correlation function @xmath10 , a distance of order @xmath11 in polymer fluids@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such interactions on length scales shorter than or equal to @xmath11 leads to the rouse equation s failure to adequately describe short - time polymer dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the inconsistency of the rouse equation with computer simulation data of short - time unentangled@xcite and entangled polymer dynamics in the melt state , and in concentrated solutions@xcite , has been known for many years . in the short - time regime , @xmath12 , the single - chain center - of - mass ( c.o.m . ) </S>",

    "<S> entangled polymer fluids show the same behavior in the short - time regime where rouse dynamics is expected to hold@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the short - time anomalous dynamics only appears in melts and in solutions above the polymer overlap concentrations@xcite , further supporting the hypothesis that their short - time anomalous dynamics is a consequence of intermolecular interactions .    in a recent paper , we derived a generalized langevin equation for the cooperative dynamics ( cdgle ) of interacting , completely flexible polymer fluids@xcite , where explicitly intramolecular and intermolecular forces are included . </S>",

    "<S> the gle for a group of @xmath18 molecules undergoing slow cooperative dynamics is derived from the first - principle liouville equation by projecting the dynamics of the entire fluid onto the phase - space of the slow variables , i.e. the coordinates of @xmath19 molecules statistically comprised inside the volume defined by the range of the mean - force potential , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the monomer density . an effective segment @xmath22 in molecule @xmath23 is driven by the intramolecular potential , @xmath24 with @xmath25 , the intermolecular time - dependent potential of mean - force , @xmath26 $ ] , and the random interactions with the surrounding fluid , where the projected random force is given by @xmath27 . </S>",

    "<S> the inclusion , or exclusion , of the intermolecular contribution , does not modify the monomer diffusion .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> we show that the center - of - mass intermolecular potential in polymer melts can be described at a good level of approximation by an effective gaussian potential . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of the local intermolecular forces in the gle strongly improves the description of the global dynamical properties of polymer melts in the short - time domain . </S>",
