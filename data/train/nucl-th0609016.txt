    "the theoretical description of strongly correlated open quantum systems ( oqs ) , such as the weakly bound / unbound atomic nuclei or atomic clusters , requires the rigorous treatment of both the many - body correlations and the continuum of positive - energy scattering states and decay channels @xcite .",
    "a major theoretical challenge is to consistently describe many - body states close to particle - emission thresholds where novel properties appear , such as , e.g. , unusual radial features of halo states or threshold anomalies in the wave functions and associated observables .",
    "these features can not be described in the closed quantum system ( cqs ) framework of a standard shell model ( sm ) which usually employs the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "basis of @xmath2-functions of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "representation of halo states in such a basis is not convenient .",
    "moreover , the resonance and scattering states do not belong to the space of @xmath3-functions .",
    "the solution of the configuration interaction problem in the presence of continuum states ( the so - called continuum shell model ) has been advanced recently in the oqs formulation of the nuclear sm , such as the shell model embedded in the continuum @xcite ( real - energy continuum sm ) and the gamow shell model ( gsm ) @xcite ( sm in the complex @xmath4-plane ) .",
    "a variant of the real - energy continuum sm , based on the feshbach projection formalism and phenomenological continuum - coupling , has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the gsm ,",
    "the multi - configurational sm is formulated in the rigged hilbert space @xcite with a s.p .",
    "basis given by the berggren ensemble @xcite consisting of gamow ( resonant or siegert ) states and the non - resonant continuum of scattering states . in general , resonant states correspond to the poles of the scattering matrix ( @xmath5-matrix ) .",
    "these are the generalized eigenstates of the time - independent schrdinger equation , which are regular at the origin and satisfy purely outgoing boundary conditions .",
    "the s.p .",
    "berggren basis is generated by a finite - depth potential , and the many - body states are expanded in slater determinants spanned by resonant and non - resonant s.p .",
    "basis states @xcite .",
    "the configuration mixing induced by the gsm hamiltonian assures a simultaneous treatment of continuum effects and inter - nucleon correlations .",
    "consequently , the gsm , which is a natural generalization of the sm for oqs , gives a natural description of many - body loosely bound and resonant states .",
    "in general , among different poles of the one - body @xmath5-matrix , one takes into account bound and decaying s.p .",
    "states to define the subset of resonant states in the berggren ensemble .",
    "these poles , together with associated non - resonant continuum states , define the valence space .",
    "the actual selection of resonant states depends on the physical problem and on the convergence properties of resulting many - body gsm states .",
    "an important question concerning the gsm deals with the inclusion of antibound ( virtual ) states in the berggren ensemble .",
    "antibound states have real and negative energy eigenvalues that are located in the second riemann sheet of the complex energy plane ( the corresponding momentum lies on the negative imaginary axis ) @xcite .",
    "contrary to bound states , the radial wave functions of virtual states increase exponentially at large distances . as often discussed in the literature",
    ", it is difficult to give a clear physical interpretation to virtual states . strictly speaking ,",
    "as the second energy sheet is considered unphysical and unaccessible through direct experiments , a virtual state is not a state but a feature of the system .",
    "if the virtual state has a sufficiently small energy , its presence has an appreciable influence on the behavior of the scattering cross section at low energies .",
    "classic examples include the low - energy @xmath6 nucleon - nucleon scattering characterized by a large and negative scattering length @xcite , scattering of slow electrons on molecules @xcite , and @xmath7 coulomb system @xcite .",
    "related to this is an increased localization of real - energy scattering states just above threshold @xcite .",
    "coming back to nuclear structure , it was argued that the neutron - unbound @xmath8li nucleus sustains a low - lying @xmath9 antibound state very close to the one - neutron ( 1n ) emission threshold @xcite as a result of the inversion of @xmath10 and @xmath9 shells @xcite .",
    "although many theoretical calculations predict the @xmath11 shell inversion , the phenomenon still remains a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "experimentally , several groups have reported evidence of the @xmath12 strength at the 1n - threshold in @xmath8li @xcite ; however , no evidence of a weakly bound @xmath9 state has been found .",
    "since , experimentally , the n@xmath13li has a large and negative scattering length , this may indicate the presence of the antibound @xmath9 state in @xmath8li close to the 1n - threshold , though the presence of a low - lying @xmath10 state can not be ruled out @xcite .",
    "the gsm calculations that explicitly consider the antibound @xmath9 s.p .",
    "state @xcite were performed recently for the g.s . of @xmath1li .",
    "the authors argued that the presence of an antibound state was important for the formation of a neutron halo .",
    "they have also noted that the bound state wave function of @xmath1li could be expanded in terms of the real - energy , non - resonant @xmath0=0 continuum , i.e. , without explicit inclusion of the antibound state .",
    "moreover , a destructive interference between the @xmath9 antibound s.p . state and the associated complex - energy , non - resonant @xmath14 background was noticed .",
    "this work addresses the question of the @xmath0=0 virtual state for the description of a neutron halo by studying several complementary berggren basis expansions and performing gsm calculations for @xmath1li in different s.p .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "one - body berggren completeness relations with bound and resonant states have already been extensively studied for neutrons @xcite and protons @xcite .",
    "the standard berggren completeness relation consists of a discrete sum over bound and resonant states , and an integral over non - resonant scattering states from the contour @xmath15 ( see fig .  [ l_plus_contours ] ) : @xmath16 where a discrete sum runs over all bound @xmath17 and resonant decaying @xmath18 states lying above the complex contour @xmath15 .",
    "the continuous part takes into account the non - resonant scattering states lying on the contour . in the particular case of the @xmath0=0 neutron partial wave ,",
    "there are no @xmath14 resonances due to the absence of both coulomb and centrifugal barriers .",
    "consequently , a real-@xmath4 contour would have been sufficient to describe the @xmath14 neutron channel . however , to investigate the convergence of imaginary part components of the expanded wave functions , we take the complex-@xmath4 contour @xmath19 close to the real-@xmath4 axis .    in this work",
    ", we shall perform detailed studies of the berggren expansion in a more general case when an @xmath0=0 antibound s.p .",
    "state is included in the basis .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "the gsm has proven to be a powerful approach for the microscopic description of loosely bound and resonant states .",
    "the fact that the underlying berggren basis directly incorporates one - particle continuum and the proper treatment of many - body correlations through configuration mixing makes it a perfect tool for a theoretical description of loosely bound many - body states such as nuclear halos .    in this study , we investigated the importance of including the virtual @xmath0=0 state in the s.p .",
    "basis for a modeling of one - body and two - body neutron halos .",
    "this question has experimental relevance : the data seem to suggest that the presence of the @xmath14 antibound state in @xmath8li is correlated with the appearance of the two - neutron halo in @xmath1li .",
    "our calculation suggests that neither conceptual nor numerical gain is achieved if the antibound states are directly considered in the berggren ensemble . in both one- and two - particle cases",
    ", it is always more advantageous to use a s.p .",
    "basis which contains non - resonant scattering states and , possibly , a bound @xmath14 pole .",
    "as the halo wave function has a decaying character at large distances due to the exponentially increasing asymptotics of the virtual state , its inclusion in the basis always induces strong negative interference with the scattering states .",
    "therefore , adding antibound states to the basis is not beneficial , as more discretized scattering @xmath14 states are necessary to reach a required precision without providing any new information about the many - body wave function .",
    "the use of antibound states in a berggren basis can only be justified if the many - body state has a virtual character .",
    "this is certainly not the case for bound states , including halos .",
    "for instance , the g.s .",
    "halo in @xmath1li is well described by using the berggren basis solely involving the @xmath14 non - resonant scattering continuum and choosing the integration contour close to the real-@xmath4 axis .",
    "while the presence of an antibound state does require an increased density of discretized states around @xmath4=0 , this can be handled efficiently by employing the density matrix renormalization group approach @xcite .",
    "the resulting procedure yields much better numerical precision by suppressing the cancellations and leaving all the physical properties unchanged .",
    "hence , the use of antibound states in gsm becomes questionable , as it worsens spurious effects due to continuum discretization .",
