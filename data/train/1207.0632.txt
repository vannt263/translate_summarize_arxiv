    "in 1946 , gabor suggested using a lattice of gaussians in time - frequency space for signal representation @xcite .",
    "( essentially the same lattice was introduced by von neumann in quantum mechanics in 1931 @xcite ) .",
    "the gabor functions are constructed by shifting a synthesis function in time and frequency such that each basis function @xmath0 has the form : @xmath1 for @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent time and frequency sampling intervals . by choosing the synthesis function @xmath5 to be concentrated in both time and frequency ( e.g. a gaussian as in gabor s original proposal ) , each one of the gabor functions is localized in a different region of the time - frequency plane .",
    "gabor s original motivation was to use these localized @xmath0 functions as a basis set for the expansion of a signal @xmath6 : @xmath7 for an arbitrary signal , eq.[expansion ] has a solution only if @xmath8 ; for the case @xmath9 , called critical sampling , the solution is unique .",
    "this expansion is potentially very efficient for signals that contain different frequency components at different time intervals . due to the localization of the basis set",
    ", one expects that only the basis functions in the active time - frequency regions are required for the expansion and therefore the representation of @xmath6 should be very efficient .",
    "the gabor basis set has been widely adopted in signal analysis , where it is known as the short time fourier transform , but it is rarely used for signal compression and reconstruction .",
    "in fact , it is generally regarded as unstable for critical sampling @xcite .",
    "the reason for the disparity between the concept and the practice can be traced to the non - orthogonality of the basis set .",
    "balian and low proved that the @xmath0 can not be made orthonormal without sacrificing the locality of @xmath5 in either time or frequency @xcite .",
    "in addition , the non - orthogonality of the basis makes the calculation of the gabor coefficients @xmath10 non trivial . in this regard ,",
    "a major advance was made by bastiaans @xcite who showed that the coefficients can be represented as the inner product between the signal @xmath6 and a basis set @xmath11 that is bi - orthogonal to @xmath0 .",
    "however , in most cases bastiaans s approach just transforms the non - trivial problem of finding @xmath10 to the non - trivial problem of finding @xmath11 .",
    "for the few special cases where @xmath11 can be calculated analytically , the gabor coefficients are found to be delocalized .",
    "about ten years after bastiaans s work , wexler and raz developed a discrete version of the gabor expansion ( henceforth ` dge ' ) that overcomes many of the earlier difficulties @xcite .",
    "the dge applies to sequences @xmath12 $ ] with period @xmath13 . in this formalism , the gabor functions in eq.[hmn ] turn into the discrete sequences @xmath14=\\tilde g[k - na]\\exp(\\frac{2\\pi j}{n_l}mbk )   \\label{dhmn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the time and frequency sampling intervals respectively and obey the relation : @xmath17 .",
    "the synthesis sequence is now a periodic extension of some window sequence @xmath18=\\sum_l g[k+ln_l]=\\tilde g[k+n_l]$ ] .",
    "analogous to eq.[expansion ] , the expansion of @xmath12 $ ] is given by : @xmath19=\\sum_{n=0}^{n-1}\\sum_{m=0}^{m-1 } c_{n , m}\\tilde g_{n , m}[k ] .",
    "\\label{dexpansion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath10 exist for @xmath20 and can be found by taking inner products between @xmath12 $ ] and a biorthogonal basis set @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "for critical sampling @xmath22 the coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath23 $ ] are unique and in contrast to the continuous - time case , can be obtained simply by solving a set of linear equations .",
    "nevertheless , some of the drawbacks of the gabor basis persist in this formalism . to understand why , recall that the gabor representation is expected to be efficient because of the time - frequency localization of the gabor basis , @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "but this expectation is based on the assumption that only the gabor functions in the active time - frequency window are required for the expansion eq.([dexpansion ] ) .",
    "it turns out that this key assumption is incorrect : the non - orthogonality of the basis leads to the counterintuitive phenomenon that even gabor functions localized where the signal @xmath25 vanishes are required for the expansion in eq.[dexpansion ] .",
    "this delocalization of the gabor coefficients has been overlooked in many studies @xcite ; in other cases , the phenomenon was addressed by oversampling i.e. @xmath26@xcite .",
    "when the oversampling is increased sufficiently , the bi - orthogonal set @xmath23 $ ] become similar to the gabor set @xmath27 $ ] and the coefficients become more localized .",
    "however , oversampling is inefficient in the sense that a time - frequency region that was previously overlapped by one gabor function in is now overlapped by many , and all of them need to be taken into account in the expansion in eq.[dexpansion ] .    as a result of these difficulties , a different approach for localized time - frequency expansion",
    "was developed called the `` wavelet '' expansion @xcite , in which the time - frequency localization is achieved by scaling the synthesis function in addition to shifting .",
    "the great advantage of this approach is that it allows one to construct a localized basis set that is orthogonal , and therefore bypass the problems of the gabor expansion .    in this work , we return to the original gabor formulation and introduce two modifications that make the representation both stable and highly efficient .",
    "the method can also be combined with wavelet or pyramidal scaling , although this will be addressed in a separate publication .",
    "the first modification is that that gabor functions are ` convolved ' with a dirichlet kernel ( a periodic sinc function ) , giving a periodic , gabor - like basis that is guaranteed to be stable since it spans exactly the time - frequency space to which nyquist s theorem applies .",
    "( in the final expressions , all that appears are the original gabor functions at the sample points . )",
    "second , the non - locality of the coefficients is overcome by exchanging the role of the gabor basis and its bi - orthogonal basis set .",
    "specifically , the localized periodic - gabor functions are used to calculate the coefficients rather that as the basis .",
    "we call the combination of the two innovations the  periodic gabor method with biorthogonal exchange \" , or pgb . in @xcite we applied the pgb to quantum mechanics with great success ; here we show here that the method can provide large savings for signal compression as well .",
    "the original proposal by gabor was to use gaussian functions on a time - frequency grid with critical sampling @xcite . under these conditions",
    "eq.[hmn ] turns into : @xmath28where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are integers . each basis function is a gaussian centered at @xmath31 in time - frequency space , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are arbitrary shifts .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 controls the fwhm of each gaussian in @xmath35 and @xmath36 space .",
    "taking @xmath37 and @xmath38 as the spacing between neighboring gaussians in @xmath35 and @xmath36 space respectively , we note that @xmath39 so we have exactly one basis function per unit cell in phase space , so - called critical sampling . assuming that the grid extends over the infinite time - frequency grid , the gabor basis is complete as shown in @xcite .    however , in any numerical calculation , @xmath29 and @xmath30 take on only a finite number of values .",
    "consider a basis consisting of @xmath40 gaussian functions @xmath41 , @xmath42 , one per unit cell . since the size of one gabor unit cell is @xmath43 , the phase space area covered by the truncated gabor lattice",
    "is : @xmath44        however , it turns out that there is a difference between the truncated gabor lattice and the truncated gabor _ basis _ : the latter is not complete for the hilbert space defined by the rectangular area @xmath45 because the boundary conditions are not appropriate .    in order to develop a truncated gabor - like basis set that is complete on the rectangular area in eq.[area ] ( fig.[vn ] ) we introduce a variant on the gabor basis set with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "consider @xmath46 to be a periodic signal with period @xmath47 and band limited in @xmath48 . by sampling @xmath46 at the nyquist rate @xmath49 at @xmath50 sampling points @xmath51",
    ", @xmath46 can be expressed in terms of its samples by : @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the dirichlet or periodic sinc functions@xcite : @xmath54 therefore the set @xmath55 for @xmath56 comprises a complete basis set for the time - frequency rectangular space @xmath57 .    by combining the dirichlet and gabor basis functions we can generate a finite `` gabor - like '' basis set that is complete on the truncated space given in eq.[area ] : @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "the new basis set is in some sense , the gabor functions with periodic boundary conditions ( henceforth , the periodic gabor or ` pg ' basis ) .",
    "we can write eq.([dvn ] ) in matrix notation as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 . by taking the width parameter @xmath62 ( and locating a gaussian function at the center of each unit cell )",
    "we can guarantee that the gabor functions have no linear dependence and that the matrix @xmath63 is invertible , that is @xmath64 .",
    "the invertibility of @xmath63 implies that both the dirichlet and the pg bases span the same space ( fig.[vn ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath46 can be expanded as : @xmath65 to find the coefficients @xmath66 we first define the overlap matrix , @xmath67 , as the inner product between pg functions : @xmath68 or @xmath69 using the completeness relationship for non - orthogonal bases @xcite , @xmath46 can be expressed as @xmath70 where , similar to eq.[ip ] , the inner product @xmath71 comparing eq .",
    "( [ psi2 ] ) with eq.([psi ] ) we find that @xmath72 for @xmath59 .",
    "although the @xmath67 matrix is localized , @xmath73 is not ; hence , eq . [ pvn_coef ] indicates that basis functions @xmath74 that are distant in time - frequency from the signal @xmath75 , still contribute to the expansion because of @xmath73 .",
    "equation [ pvn_coef ] can be written in an alternative way : @xmath76 where @xmath77 for @xmath59 .",
    "we will call the @xmath78 basis the biorthogonal gabor or ` bg ' basis since the pg and bg bases taken by themselves are non - orthogonal but are orthogonal to each other .",
    "this can be shown easily by : @xmath79 this biorthogonality property was used to great advantage by bastiaans on the infinite basis set , but here the biorthogonality property holds on a truncated rectangular region in the time - frequency space .    so far the pg basis set provides two great advantages over the traditional gabor basis set .",
    "first , in the original gabor basis @xmath40 functions give a very inaccurate expansion of @xmath46@xcite , whereas the periodicity of the pg basis makes the expansion exact for functions that are band - limited with finite support , bypassing the balian - low theorem .",
    "second , the coefficients in the original gabor basis require knowledge of the bi - orthogonal basis , which in most cases is non - trivial to calculate . in the pg basis , no knowledge of the bi - orthogonal basis is necessary ( eq.[pvn_coef ] ) . nevertheless , the compression is still problematic since , as discussed at eq .",
    "[ pvn_coef ] , basis functions that are distant in time - frequency from the signal still contribute to the expansion .",
    "we now turn to the issue of compression .",
    "gabor s original idea was to exploit the time - frequency localization of the basis functions to reduce the size of basis .",
    "this intuitively appealing ideas translates to the statement that a significant fraction of the basis will fulfill the relation : @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "however , there is an important subtlety  we can not simply eliminate the states @xmath82 , since as noted at eq .",
    "[ pvn_coef ] , even pg functions that are remote from the signal can contribute to the expansion .",
    "nevertheless , we can take advantage of the near - vanishing @xmath83 , if we exchange the roles of the bg and pg bases , allowing the delocalized bg functions to serve as the basis set for @xmath46 .",
    "then eq.[psi2 ] becomes : @xmath84 by assumption , @xmath85 of the @xmath83 are zero , hence in order to represent @xmath46 in the bg basis set we need only @xmath86 basis functions . to emphasize , although the basis @xmath87 has played a central role in gabor theory since 1980 , it has always been used for finding the _ coefficients _ of the gabor basis .",
    "equation [ bvn_rec ] is a radical departure from the existing literature since the roles of the ( periodic ) gabor and the biorthogonal ( periodic)gabor bases have been exchanged , with the bi - orthogonal functions now actually serving as the _ basis _ for the expansion of the signal and the localized original functions used for the calculation of the coefficients .",
    "hence the name of the method,periodic gabor theory with biorthogonal exchange \" , or pgb .    as discussed above ,",
    "a large number of the coefficients in the pgb method are expected to be close to zero . after eliminating the small coefficients by quantization or entropy compression",
    ", one can use the remaining coefficients and the corresponding bg functions to obtain an approximate reconstruction of the original signal .",
    "we have found that the accuracy of the reconstruction , although quite good , can be further improved using a method developed by porat@xcite .",
    "the first step in porat s method is to find a basis that is biorthogonal to the contracted bg set , i.e. by repeating the procedure of eq.[ip ] and eq.[fvn ] but with the role of the @xmath40 pg functions played by the @xmath88 bg set . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath67 matrix is now defined in terms of the contracted set only",
    ". then the desired coefficients are obtained by the inner product between this new biorthogonal set and the original signal .",
    "we will show results using the porat correction below .",
    "the pgb method can be formulated for discrete sequences as well as for continuous signals .",
    "consider a discrete sequence @xmath89 $ ] of length @xmath40 , which can be viewed as samples taken at @xmath90 of an @xmath40 periodic signal @xmath46 that is band limited in the interval @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "let the gabor grid consist of @xmath92 and @xmath93 gaussians in @xmath35 and @xmath36 spaces respectively such that @xmath94 .",
    "the parameters that define the gabor functions in eq.[g ] are @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the pgb representation of the sequence is given by : @xmath100 or in matrix notation : @xmath101 where x is the length @xmath40 column vector of the sequence of values , @xmath102 is the @xmath103 matrix with elements @xmath104 and d is the coefficient vector given by eq.[ip_g_signal ] . using eq.[fvn ] and the fact that @xmath105 , we find that : @xmath106 or in matrix form : @xmath107 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) .",
    "equation [ bgdagger ] can be written succinctly as @xmath108 .",
    "the related equation @xmath109 is also correct , but has a completely different physical significance  it corresponds to the expansion of the signal in terms of the original gabor basis , without the exchange of roles with the biorthogonal basis ; in other words it corresponds to a discrete pg representation .",
    "it turns out that this discrete pg representation is fully equivalent to the dge .",
    "in fact , the equation @xmath109 appears in @xcite , albeit for just one column of the matrix .",
    "we first address the difference in accuracy between the standard gabor basis and the pg basis set without exchange .",
    "consider the chirped gaussian @xmath110 with @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "we will compare the reconstruction using 64 gabor and 64 pg functions .",
    "both basis sets consist of gaussian functions on an @xmath114 time - frequency lattice .",
    "the gabor coefficients were calculated using the procedure in @xcite .",
    "figure [ continous_rec](a ) shows the real part of the original signal and the reconstructions obtained using both bases .",
    "figure [ continous_rec](b ) shows the difference between the reconstructed and the original signal .",
    "the norm of the error is @xmath115 for the gabor basis and @xmath116 for the pg basis .",
    "we now turn to compression using the pgb method .",
    "( by compression we mean using only a small subset of the coefficients for the reconstruction . )",
    "we present three examples .",
    "the first is a 1-d rectangular pulse , an important exmaple for signal processing .",
    "the second is the 2-d  lena \" picture , a benchmark for image processing .",
    "the third is an audio signal corresponding to a ` splat ' sound . for each example",
    ", we compress the signal using a small subset of the coefficients and present the reconstruction from this subset .",
    "the rectangular pulse was studied previously by wexler and raz@xcite . following those authors we consider a rectangular pulse represented by a discrete sequence of 64 points , compressed using 25 coefficients .",
    "the reconstruction obtained with the pg basis is essentially identical to the one reported by wexler and raz using the dge @xcite ( see the discussion below eq .",
    "[ bgdagger ] ) .",
    "however , with the pgb method the reconstruction is improved by essentially an order of magnitude ( @xmath117 norm of the error is 0.3989 in the dge and 0.0469 in the pgb method ) .",
    "comparison of the spectrum in the dge and the pgb methods ( fig.[figure : spectrum ] ) demonstrates the much higher localization of the pgb coefficients , specifically in the time coordinate ( the signal is inherently delocalized in frequency ) .        several works have extended the dge to two dimension in order to apply it to image compression@xcite .",
    "although the 2-d dge reduces the entropy of an image , the entropy can be reduced much further using the pgb method .",
    "we will demonstrate this on the lena image ( fig .",
    "[ lena_rec](a ) ) , which is a benchmark for image compression .",
    "the original image contain @xmath118 pixels .",
    "figure [ lena_rec ] shows the reconstruction of the image using only the 2621 largest coefficients ( @xmath119 1@xmath120 of the coefficients ) , using the dft ( b ) , the dge method ( c ) and the pgb method ( e ) .",
    "the mean - square - error of the reconstructed image is 417 in the dge and 327 in the pgb method , but the difference in visual quality is far more significant than these numbers indicate .",
    "figure [ lena_rec](d , f ) shows the reconstruction of the image using 2621 coefficients when porat s correction is applied to both methods .",
    "the mean - square - error of the reconstructed image is 279 in the dge and 144 in the pgb method .",
    "again , the difference in visual quality is far more significant than these numbers indicate .",
    "the pgb result with porat s correction is better than the dft ( mean - square - error of 173 ) with the same number of coefficients ( fig .",
    "[ lena_rec](b ) ) . finally , we consider an example of an audio signal , which demonstrates the advantage of the pgb representation over the time and frequency representations",
    ". the original audio signal is sampled at 10000 sampling points .",
    "we used the pgb method on a grid of 100 * 100 unit cells in time - frequency space .",
    "figure([splat_representation ] ) shows the signal in the time , frequency and pgb representations .",
    "we reconstructed the signal for various basis set sizes and calculated the norm of the error ( the difference between the original and the reconstructed signal ) using both the original pgb coefficients also the pgb coefficients after porat s correction .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "( [ comp_splat ] ) . for comparison ,",
    "we show results retaining the same number of dft coefficients .",
    "clearly , the pgb method allows much more compression than the dft , but introduces some residual roughness .",
    "this roughness may be removed using porat s correction , although the latter involves some additional computational cost .",
    "we introduced a new basis set called the periodic gabor or pg basis which is effectively a ` convolution ' of the gabor and dirichlet ( periodic sinc ) functions .",
    "the original gabor basis is complete for the infinite space but incomplete , and actually unstable for a truncated rectangular region in time - frequency space .",
    "in contrast , the pg basis provides a complete and stable representation for a truncated rectangular area in time - frequency space , i.e. for the hilbert space spanned by functions that are band - limited with finite support .",
    "moreover , the coefficients in the pg representation may be calculated by simple matrix multiplication ( eq.[pvn_coef ] ) .",
    "we noted that although the pg functions are localized , the corresponding biorthogonal bg basis functions that determine the coefficients are not . by exchanging the roles of the pg and bg bases , (  periodic gabor method with bi - orthogonal exchange \" or ` pgb ' )",
    "the coefficients become localized , leading to large compression factors .",
    "the pgb formalism is trivially adapted to the case of discrete signals .",
    "we provided three examples of finite sequences , and showed the large compression factors achievable using the pgb coefficients .",
    "although we have not exploited it here , eq .",
    "( [ dvn ] ) combined with eq .",
    "( [ area ] ) allows the freedom to choose gaussian basis functions of different widths and spacings .",
    "that means that in principle we can combine the time - frequency shifting with a scaling transformation , similar to what is done in the wavelet approach and in the pyramidal gabor function .",
    "in fact , the formalism is not restricted to gaussians  it can be extended to any localized basis functions as long as the unit cell area obeys @xmath121 .",
    "more research will be required on how to optimize the basis for a given signal .",
    "we fully expect that the pgb method and its generalizations , with its combination of simplicity , flexibility , accuracy , stability and efficiency , will provide a competitive alternative to wavelet methods .",
    "this work was supported by the israel science foundation grant 807/08 and the us - israel binational science foundation .",
