    "stability analysis and controller design for partial differential equations ( pdes ) is an active area of research @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one approach to stability analysis of pdes is to approximate the pdes with ordinary differential equations ( odes ) using , e.g. galerkin s method or finite difference , and then apply finite - dimensional optimal control methods , e.g. @xcite@xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider stability analysis without discretization .",
    "specifically , we use sum - of - squares ( sos ) optimization to construct lyapunov functionals for parabolic pdes with two spatial variables and spatially dependent coefficients .",
    "it is well - known that existence of a lyapunov function for a system of odes or pdes is a sufficient condition for stability .",
    "for example ,  @xcite uses a lyapunov approach and linear operator inequalities ( lois ) to provide sufficient conditions for exponential stability of a controlled heat and delayed wave equations . another method based on lyapunov and",
    "semigroup theories was applied in @xcite for analysis of wave and beam pdes with constant coefficients and delayed boundary control . in @xcite a lyapunov based analysis of semilinear diffusion equations with delays gave stability conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities ( lmis ) .",
    "extensive examples of applying the backstepping method to the boundary control of pdes can be found in @xcite@xcite . briefly speaking , backstepping uses a volterra operator to search for an invertible mapping from the original pde to a chosen `` target '' pde , known to be stable . in order to find such mapping , one has to solve analytically or numerically a pde for volterra operator s kernel .",
    "if the mapping is found , it provides the boundary control law .",
    "applications for two - dimensional cases were discussed in @xcite and @xcite . however",
    ", backstepping requires us to guess on the target pde and solve the pde for kernel , which may be a challenging task for pdes with two spatial variables and spatially dependent coefficients .",
    "moreover , backstepping can not be used for stability analysis in the absence of a control input .",
    "note that sos has been previously applied in @xcite and @xcite to find lyapunov functionals for 1d parabolic pde .",
    "input - output analysis of pde systems with sos implementation is discussed in @xcite .",
    "examples of using sos in controller design for one - dimensional pdes can be found in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to provide an algorithm for stability analysis of 2d parabolic pdes with spatially varying coefficients .",
    "we search for polynomial @xmath1 which defines a lyapunov functional of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the solution of the pde , @xmath4 represents time , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the spatial variable and domain .",
    "we introduce stability conditions in the form of parameter dependent lmis , which certify lyapunov inequalities , i.e. @xmath7<0\\text { for all}\\ t>0.\\vspace{-.01 in } \\label{eq : lyapu_ieq}\\ ] ] there exist several algorithms for optimization over polynomials which can be applied to   in order to find @xmath8 .",
    "see e.g. ,  @xcite for a survey on algorithms for optimization of polynomials . in this paper",
    ", we apply sos and the positivstellensatz results to find a solution to parameter dependent lmis . for details on positivstellensatz see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we use the matlab toolbox sostools ( see @xcite for details on sostools ) and sedumi , a well - known semidefinite programming solver , to solve the sos optimization problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we specify the notation and provide some background .",
    "lyapunov stability conditions for parabolic pdes are given in section 3 .",
    "we demonstrate the proposed method in section 4 and present sos optimization problems in section 5 .",
    "finally , we discuss numerical implementations in section 6 and conclude the paper in section 7 with ideas about future research steps .",
