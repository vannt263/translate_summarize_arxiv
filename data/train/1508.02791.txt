    "since launch in 2009 , _ kepler _ has revealed more than 4000 exoplanet candidates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a large percentage ( @xmath0 ) of these candidates are in systems with tightly - packed inner planets ( stips ) .",
    "these are systems that usually have 3 or more detected planets of radii @xmath1 and with periods less than 100 days @xcite .",
    "there are two main scenarios that can produce such close - in planets : ( 1 ) formation in the outer disk followed by inward migration ; ( 2 ) formation _ in situ _",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ct14 ) .",
    "the inward migration scenario tends to produce planets that are trapped in orbits of low order mean motion resonances , which is not a particular feature of stips @xcite .",
    "thus it has been proposed that the lack of resonant pile - ups might be explained by a lower efficiency of resonance trapping or breaking of resonance by later dynamical processes for the typically low - mass _ kepler_-detected planets @xcite .",
    "the _ in situ _ formation scenario faces the challenge of concentrating enough solids in the inner region @xcite . for example , supply of pebbles by radial drift may be truncated if planet formation , perhaps initiated by the pebble streaming instability @xcite , occurs in the outer disk .",
    "_ in situ _ formation models also face the challenge of reproducing the observed mass versus orbital radius distributions once effects of gas on protoplanet migration during the oligarchic growth phase are accounted for .",
    "the inside - out planet formation ( iopf ) scenario proposed by ct14 is a new type of _ in situ _ formation model .",
    "it starts with pebble delivery to the midplane transition region between the innermost mri - active zone and a nonactive `` dead zone , '' where there is a local pressure maximum .",
    "the pebbles trapped by the pressure maximum will build up in a ring , which then forms a protoplanet , perhaps involving a variety of processes including streaming @xcite , gravitational @xcite and/or rossby wave instabilities .",
    "the protoplanet is expected to continue its growth , especially by pebble accretion , until it becomes massive enough to open a gap in the disk .",
    "this gap pushes the pressure maximum outwards by a few hill radii thus creating a new pebble trap that is displaced from the planet s orbit , but may also allow mri - activation in the region beyond the planet , which could induce further outward retreat of the dzib .",
    "as discussed by ct14 , planetary migration , either before gap opening ( type i ) or after gap opening ( type ii ) , may in principle alter this scenario .",
    "however , the expectation is that the pressure maximum associated with this inner disk transition region will also act as a planet trap , so the planet will stay at its initial formation location and keep accreting more materials , at least until the point of gap opening .",
    "however , this needs to be confirmed for the particular disk structure involved in iopf and this is one of the goals of this paper .",
    "the disk studied by @xcite was a purely passive disk , i.e , the temperature was set only by irradiation from the central star .",
    "@xcite studied planetary migration in a disk with an inner region heated by viscous dissipation and an outer region heated by stellar luminosity .",
    "this structure also contained a local pressure maximum that acted as a trap for type i planetary migration . in the model for iopf , the first planet is formed at the outer edge of the mri active zone around the protostar ( where @xmath2  k , leading to thermal ionization of alkali metals ) and migration needs to be studied in the context of an active disk , i.e. , heated by viscous accretion , with accretion rates @xmath3 .",
    "the magnitude of the planet mass that leads to gap opening and potential dzib retreat is also of crucial importance for the iopf theory .",
    "gap opening has been studied by @xcite , who proposed a `` viscous - thermal '' criterion that sets a gap opening mass .",
    "this mass is sensitive to the local disk viscosity .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic simulations with realistic turbulence have also been carried out to study gap opening in turbulent disks @xcite .",
    "the second goal of this paper is to study gap opening and quantify the gap opening mass in the context of the iopf disk model , i.e. , an inner region of an active disk where the effective viscosity is undergoing a sharp increase in the radially inward direction .",
    "these gap opening masses can then be compared to masses of the innermost , so - called `` vulcan '' planets .",
    "an initial comparison of the simple , analytic gap opening mass prediction with the observed vulcans has been carried out by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ct15 , paper ii ) , who found a predicted scaling and normalization of planet mass versus orbital radius , @xmath4 , of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a dimensionless parameter that indicates the fraction of the lin - papaloizou mass scale that is assumed to lead to a deep enough gap to truncate planetary accretion of pebbles and initiate dzib retreat .",
    "the normalization of this gap opening planet mass at given radius also depends on the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter , @xmath7 , in the dead zone inner boundary region , with the fiducial value of @xmath8 being adopted in the above formula .",
    "however , this value is quite uncertain and the observed planet masses may require a somewhat lower value of @xmath9 ( paper ii ) , or a lower value of @xmath10 .",
    "finally , our third goal is investigate how gap opening may induce dzib retreat , which then sets the location of second planet formation . here",
    "we will present a simple , heuristic first exploration of this process by modeling the location of the dzib as set by penetration of x - rays emitted from the protostellar corona to the disk midplane beyond the planet - induced gap .",
    "this location then sets the radius for an imposed radial profile of viscosity that simulates the transition region from an mri - active inner region to an outer dead zone .",
    "increased viscosity leads to reduced densities that make it easier for x - rays to penetrate further .",
    "we present example toy models of this process in which the location of the dzib ends up stabilizing several initial gap widths away from the planet .",
    "such separations can be compared to the observed separation of orbits of innermost stips planets .    in  [",
    "s : analytic ] , we describe an analytic model to calculate our disk parameters . in ",
    "[ s : numerical ] , we describe our numerical set - up and test the numerical simulations against the analytic model . in  [ s : migration ] , we study migration of planets of various masses located in the dzib region . in  [ s : gapopening ] , we study gap opening and dzib retreat . in ",
    "[ s : obs ] , we discuss the implications of our results for observed planets .",
    "we conclude in  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "as in paper i , we follow @xcite s derivation of the structure of a viscously heated accretion disk . these results will be compared to the numerical simulations with fargo , described below in  [ s : numerical ] . to achieve consistency with these simulations",
    "we find we need to make a small correction in the choice of the vertical optical depth equation and now adopt : @xmath11 with the factor of 0.5 being introduced since the disk has two faces ( or equivalently a change in the definition of `` midplane '' conditions ) .",
    "thus when calculating the balance between energy dissipation and radiative cooling , the optical depth is integrated from the midplane to each surface of the disk .",
    "this change then leads to modest ( @xmath12 ) changes in the normalization of the disk structure equations compared to ct14 .",
    "for example , for disk mass surface density we now derive : @xmath13 ( ct14 derived a normalization of @xmath14 ) , where @xmath15 is the mean particle mass ( assuming @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath18 is the power law exponent of the barotropic equation of state @xmath19 where we have normalized for @xmath20 with rotational modes excited , @xmath21 is stefan - boltzmann s constant , @xmath22 is the stellar mass , @xmath23 is disk opacity ( normalized to expected protoplanetary disk values , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath24 , ( where @xmath25 is stellar radius ) , and @xmath26 is the accretion rate .    for the disk aspect ratio we find @xmath27 the above equations will be used to set the initial conditions of the fargo simulations described below .    given this disk structure ,",
    "the viscous criterion for the gap opening planet mass is : @xmath28 implementing our disk model , we obtain : @xmath29 this is a factor @xmath30 smaller than the ct14 result .",
    "the full set of disk structure equations with our revised normalizations are presented in appendix  [ app : equations ] .",
    "we used the 2d code fargo - adsg @xcite , which is built on fargo , but with the energy equation and disk self - gravity implemented .",
    "self - gravity has not been turned on in our calculation since the disk is far from gravitational instability in our problem , which focusses on inner regions near the star .",
    "we also implemented a simple method of radiative cooling that uses the disk surface density to calculate the optical depth and cooling rate as described in @xcite .",
    "we set up a disk with the same mass surface density profile , flaring index , opacity , adiabatic index , mean molecular mass and central stellar mass as the fiducial analytic model in ",
    "[ s : analytic ] .",
    "the energy equation implemented in fargo - adsg is @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the thermal energy per unit area , @xmath33 is the flow velocity and @xmath34(@xmath35 ) denote heating ( cooling ) source terms , assumed to be positive quantities . in a steady accretion disk , these terms can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 are components of the viscous stress tensor ,    @xmath38 is the midplane temperature .",
    "note @xmath39 is the optical depth from disk midplane to the surface . ] .",
    "first we set up an accretion disk with a constant value of @xmath7 , i.e. , without a transition zone , and a steady accretion rate of @xmath40 , simulating a range of radii from 0.02 to 0.3  au .",
    "in all simulations we use the evanescent boundary condition .",
    "this damps the disk values ( surface density , velocities and energy density ) to the initial axisymmetric disk conditions .",
    "the damping regions are rings within the radial ranges [ @xmath41 and [ @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the inner ( outer ) radius of the disk .",
    "the damping parameter is increased from zero to a maximum from the edge of damping zone to the edge of the disk .    within each orbit ,",
    "the damping amplitude is not a constant : the actual damping is the calculated damping function times a coefficient , which gradually grows from zero to one , linearly with time .    for our standard `` medium resolution ( mr ) , ''",
    "the disk is evenly divided by 300 sectors azimuthally and logarithmically divided by 128 sectors radially .",
    "this gives a typical grid size of @xmath44  au , which is about the same as the hill radius of a 1-@xmath45-mass planet located at 0.1  au .",
    "we also carry out `` high resolution ( hr ) '' simulations that have twice the mr resolution , and a few test runs ( of more limited time duration ) at `` super - high resolution '' ( shr ) that have four times the mr resolution .",
    "we next set up a disk that has a radial jump in @xmath7 . moving inwards ,",
    "@xmath7 rises from @xmath46 at 0.1  au to @xmath47 at 0.07  au , i.e. , over a transition width of @xmath48  au , with the transition described by part of the function @xmath49 from @xmath50 ( at 0.1  au ) to @xmath51 ( at 0.07  au ) . the initial mass surface density profile is also chosen to give a steady accretion rate across this transition region .",
    "the steady radial profile achieved after 1000 orbits is close to this initial choice and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmaradialprofile ] .",
    "we study the migration of protoplanets of various fixed masses ( 0.1 , 0.5 and 1.0  @xmath45 ) that are inserted into the transition zone region of the disk by measuring the torques exerted on the planet by the disk .",
    "for each planet mass , we run simulations holding the planet at a constant radius , exploring uniformly from 0.085 to 0.115  au with a spacing of 0.001  au .",
    "so for each planet mass there are 31 mr and hr simulations run , for a total of 186 simulations .",
    "note we keep the @xmath7 viscosity radial profile constant in all the simulations in this section .",
    "we run each simulation for 400 orbits , thus allowing the gas disk to achieve a quasi equilibrium structure .",
    "we then evaluate the torque on the planet by averaging over the next 100 orbits .",
    "given the 2d nature of these simulations , we adopt a smoothing length in the calculation of the planet s gravitational potential of @xmath52 .    the torque , @xmath53 , is scaled as @xmath54 , where @xmath4 is the orbital radius of the planet and @xmath55 is the average gas mass surface density at this orbital radius . the grid size in our standard mr run is more than twice the hill radius of a planet with @xmath56 .",
    "we therefore carry out hr simulations with twice greater resolution and examine numerical convergence .    in all cases for 0.1  @xmath45 , 0.5  @xmath45 and 1.0  @xmath45-mass planets ( which correspond to very different levels of gap opening  see below ) , the torque profiles show a common behavior of @xmath53 decreasing from positive to negative values in the transition region ( where @xmath7 starts decreasing as @xmath4 increases just interior of @xmath57  au ) , indicative of a stable `` planet trap '' in this location , where @xmath58 ( see figure  [ fig : planettrap ] ) .",
    "we note that the magnitude of @xmath53 decreases significantly as @xmath59 increases from the type i to type ii regimes .",
    "this confirmation of planet trapping at the dzib transition zone is a key requirement of iopf , since this allows a planet to continue to grow by pebble accretion from low to relatively high masses .",
    "next we investigate how pebble accretion may be disrupted by gap opening by looking at the detailed structure of the gaps .",
    "the gap opening process in iopf is critical to termination of pebble accretion of the first planet , thus setting its mass . it may also be important , in combination with dead zone retreat , in setting the location of the pressure maximum that leads to new pebble ring formation and then second planet formation .",
    "we now investigate the disk structure that is induced by introducing planets of various masses at a fixed location of @xmath60  au , i.e. , at the transition zone of the disk with a fixed @xmath7 profile .",
    "figure  [ fig : gap ] shows the radial profiles of mass surface density , midplane pressure and midplane temperature after 1000 orbits of evolution from introduction of planets of masses @xmath61 to @xmath62 in steps of 0.1  @xmath45 .",
    "we note that the gas profile settles very quickly , within @xmath63 orbits , to a profile close to that of the final state at 1000 orbits .    as planet mass increases , the radial profiles show a gradual deepening of the gap in both the mass surface density and pressure profiles .",
    "the temperature also dips due to reduced viscous heating and smaller optical depths . for this particular set - up , with a transition zone width of 0.03 au",
    ", it is only once planet masses are @xmath64 that there is significant displacement of the azimuthally averaged pressure maximum away from the planet s orbital radius .",
    "table  [ tab : deltar ] lists the separation of the pressure maximum from the planet s orbital radius at 0.1  au , @xmath65 , but normalized by the planet s hill radius , @xmath66 .",
    "we define @xmath67 .",
    "as @xmath59 increases from 0.4 to 0.5  @xmath45 , @xmath68 grows by a factor of 10 from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gap ] shows this also corresponds to the mass surface density maximum retreating outwards by a similar amount .",
    "we have compared gap opening results for simulations with @xmath71 at mr and hr resolutions .",
    "we find very similar radial profiles of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , with agreement in values at better than 10% across the width of the gap region .",

    "this figure shows that the local pressure maximum remains closely located with the outer @xmath7 transition radius , i.e. , where it begins to rise from its dzib value of 0.001 .",
    "figure [ fig:2devolperturb ] shows the 2d @xmath4-@xmath75 plots of perturbations of mass surface density and pressure for the case a evolving @xmath7 model and compares to the fixed @xmath7 model , both of which have @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ fig:2devol ] shows the absolute values of these quantities . for completeness , to better illustrate physical appearance of disk structures , we also show true spatial maps of disk mass surface density structure of case a in figure  [ fig:2devolpolar ] .",
    "these figures reveal the decreasing absolute mass surface density of the induced spiral arm in the case where dzib retreat has proceeded further .",
    "we emphasize that we have presented a very simple , heuristic model for a disk in which the viscosity profile responds actively to x - ray penetration ( which itself is sensitive to the disk s structure ) .",
    "more accurate modeling would involve self - consistent calculation of the viscosity caused by the mri in the transition zone ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including calculation of the ionization structure of the disk as it is affected by gap opening .",
    "the results that are needed from such modeling are the shape and absolute values of the disk viscosity in the mri transition zone , which could then be implemented parametrically in , e.g. ,",
    "fargo hydrodynamic simulations of the disk . however , potential instability of the dead zone inner edge , which may lead it to vary its radial location @xcite , or vortex formation at the inner edge , should also be assessed .",
    "although the model presented so far should be regarded as illustrative , as we discuss in ",
    "[ s : obs ] , the scale of pressure maximum retreat that it exhibits is comparable to the orbital separations of the innermost planets in stips .",
    "ct14 examined the separation of planet orbits in stips ( normalized by hill radius of inner planet in the pair ) , finding a broad range of separations from innermost , vulcan , planet to next planet of @xmath77few100 , with a broad peak from @xmath78 .",
    "note , however , that this analysis was based on the simple , single power law planetary mass - size relation of @xcite .",
    "ct15 analyzed the available mass - size data for stips planets and derived an improved , piece - wise power law mass - size relation . here",
    ", we use this relation ( pl3 in ct15 ) to re - evaluate the distributions of @xmath79 through @xmath80 , where the numerical value of the subscript refers to the number of the planet that is the innermost in the pair being considered , counting out from the star .",
    "these results are presented in figure  [ fig : obs ] .",
    "note some of the dispersion in separations is likely to be induced by an intrinsic dispersion in the densities of the planets , leading to inaccurate estimation of masses .",
    "for example , the observed dispersion in density of a factor of about 5 ( e.g. , ct15 ) leads to a dispersion in inferred mass of the same factor and a dispersion in @xmath81 and @xmath82 of a factor of 1.7 .",
    "also , the observed values of @xmath79 may be overestimated if some fraction of second planets are non - transiting and thus not detected due to slight orbital misalignments .    in figure",
    "[ fig : obs ] we also show the locations of @xmath83 for the fixed and evolving @xmath7 disk models we considered .",
    "we note that the evolving @xmath7 disk models can achieve separations of @xmath84 to 70 @xmath81 , which overlap with the observed distribution of @xmath79 .",
    "as discussed by ct14 , the distributions of @xmath79 are significantly different from those of the outer separations .",
    "this conclusion remains unchanged by our use of the improved piecewise power - law ct15 mass - size relation . for kpc systems with @xmath85 , the probability that @xmath79 and @xmath86 are drawn from the same distribution is @xmath87 .",
    "similarly , for systems with @xmath88 , the respective probabilities that two @xmath82 distributions are drawn from the same underlying distribution are @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 for @xmath79 and @xmath86 , @xmath79 and @xmath92 , and @xmath86 and @xmath93 .",
    "this indicates that the distribution of separations between the first two planets is different than between the 2nd and 3rd and other outer pairs of planets in these systems .",
    "as also discussed by ct14 , the generally larger values of @xmath94 may be a signature of the greater relative effect of inner disk clearing after first , vulcan planet formation on the location of the second planet , compared to later , more incremental dead zone retreats .",
    "we have explored three main aspects of the inside - out planet formation ( iopf ) scenario with numerical simulations of planet - disk interactions .",
    "our main findings are the following :    \\(1 ) planets of all relevant masses are trapped at the dead zone inner boundary transition region , so planetary migration ( of type i or type ii ) does not appear to be a problem for iopf . especially during the early stages of potential type i migration , the fact that the protoplanet is trapped at its formation location should allow it to continue to accrete , especially by pebble accretion .",
    "\\(2 ) the mass scale of significant gap opening that can affect pebble accretion by displacing the local pressure maximum away from the planet is @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath96 , which is about @xmath97 in the fiducial case at @xmath98 .",
    "this is similar to the fiducial value adopted by ct14 , especially since given the renormalization of @xmath45 by a factor of 0.745 in this paper (  2 ) , this means that the overall change in planet mass is only a factor of 1.24 . however , these results are derived in the context of pure hydrodynamic simulations and may be sensitive to including extra physics of mri activation in the gap region .",
    "\\(3 ) a simple model for mri activation in the gap region , implemented by an evolving @xmath7 viscosity profile set by x - ray penetration , leads to greater retreat of the pressure maximum out to separations of @xmath84 to 70 hill radii of the planet , but sensitive to model assumptions about the shape of the viscosity profile in the mri - active region to dead zone transition region .",
    "such separations overlap with the observed orbital separations of innermost planets in stips .",
    "future work is needed to better model viscosity profiles in such transition regions .    while the above results are supportive of the iopf model for being relevant for formation of stips , a number of open questions remain .",
    "for example , even though planets with masses @xmath99 appear likely to be trapped at a location where they can continue to grow by pebble accretion , it is possible that this is not the case at earlier stages for lower mass protoplanets .",
    "have pointed out that inwardly migrating vortices can form at the dead zone inner edge and they can potentially interact with the planet , possibly causing it to also migrate inwards . however , their 3-d simulation results are for an unstratified disk and the mass accretion rate is not a constant across the dead zone inner edge , leading to mass pile up and potentially influencing vortex formation .",
    "the potential effects of vortex interactions still needs to be confirmed in 3-d stratified simulations where the presence of the surface active layer may transport the disk mass smoothly across the dead zone inner edge . in our 2-d simulations",
    ", we used a small viscosity in the dead zone region to represent the effects of an active layer and/or turbulent wakes spreading from the inner mri - active region , which may control the accretion rate in this radial region of the disk . with this set - up",
    "we do not observe the sharp density peaks at the dead zone inner edge that were present in the simulations .",
    "further work is needed on the iopf model to study the transition of the pebble ring to a single dominant protoplanet , potentially involving streaming and gravitational instabilities of the pebble population and/or rossby wave instabilities in the gas , followed by oligarchic growth of planetesimals combined with continued pebble accretion .",
    "improved study of pebble supply truncation during the process of gap opening , including utilizing 3-d simulations , are also needed .",
    "potential migration of planets after their main accretion phase and retreat of their natal dzib , including due to interactions between neighboring planets , is another topic for future study .",
    "however , we note that for the fiducial iopf model , the gas mass that is present in the vicinity of first planet to form is relatively small compared to the planet s mass , thus limiting the scope of its migration .",

    "<S> the _ kepler _ mission has discovered more than 4000 exoplanet candidates . </S>",
    "<S> many of them are in systems with tightly packed inner planets ( stips ) . </S>",
    "<S> inside - out planet formation ( iopf ) @xcite has been proposed as a scenario to explain these systems . </S>",
    "<S> it involves sequential _ in situ _ planet formation at the local pressure maximum of a retreating dead zone inner boundary ( dzib ) . </S>",
    "<S> pebbles accumulate at this pressure trap , which builds up a pebble ring , and then a planet . </S>",
    "<S> the planet is expected to grow in mass until it opens a gap , which helps to both truncate pebble accretion and also induce dzib retreat that sets the location of formation of the next planet . </S>",
    "<S> this simple scenario may be modified if the planet undergoes significant migration from its formation location . </S>",
    "<S> thus planet - disk interactions play a crucial role in the iopf scenario . here </S>",
    "<S> we present numerical simulations that first assess the degree of migration for planets of various masses that are forming at the dzib of an active accretion disk , where the effective viscosity is undergoing a rapid increase in the radially inward direction . </S>",
    "<S> we find that torques exerted on the planet by the disk tend to trap the planet at a location very close to the initial pressure maximum where it formed . </S>",
    "<S> we then study gap opening by these planets to assess at what mass a significant gap is created . </S>",
    "<S> finally we present a simple model for dzib retreat due to penetration of x - rays from the star to the disk midplane . </S>",
    "<S> overall , these simulations help to quantify both the mass scale of first , `` vulcan , '' planet formation and the orbital separation to the location of second planet formation .    </S>"
