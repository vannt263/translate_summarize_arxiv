    "we give a very brief summary of galprop ; for details we refer to the relevant papers @xcite-@xcite and a dedicated website .",
    "the propagation equation is solved numerically on a spatial grid , either in 2d with cylindrical symmetry in the galaxy or in full 3d .",
    "the boundaries of the model in radius and height , and the grid spacing , are user - definable .",
    "parameters for all processes in the propagation equation can be controlled on input .",
    "the distribution of cr sources can be freely chosen , typically to represent supernova remnants .",
    "source spectral shape and isotopic composition ( relative to protons ) are input parameters .",
    "cross - sections are based on extensive compilations and parameterizations @xcite .",
    "the numerical solution is evolved forward in time until a steady - state is reached ; a time - dependent solution is also an option . starting with the heaviest primary nucleus considered ( e.g. , @xmath2ni )",
    "the propagation solution is used to compute the source term for its spallation products , which are then propagated in turn , and so on down to protons , secondary electrons and positrons , and antiprotons . in this way",
    "secondaries , tertiaries , etc . , are included .",
    "primary electrons are treated separately .",
    "the proton , helium , and electron spectra are normalized to data ; all other isotopes are determined by the source composition and propagation .",
    "@xmath0-rays and synchrotron emission are computed using interstellar gas data ( for pion - decay and bremsstrahlung ) and the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) model ( for inverse compton ) .",
    "the computing resources required by galprop are moderate by current standards .",
    "recent extensions to galprop include    * new detailed calculation of the isrf @xcite * proper implementation of the anisotropic inverse compton scattering using new isrf ( figure 1 , left ) * interstellar gas distributions based on current hi and co surveys @xcite * new parameterization of the @xmath3 production in @xmath4-collisions @xcite which includes the diffraction dissociation * non - linear mhd wave  particle interactions ( wave damping ) @xcite are included as an option * the kinetic energy range is now extended down to @xmath51 kev * the @xmath0-ray calculations extend from kev to tens of tev ( e.g. , figure 1 , right ) , and produce full sky maps as a function of energy ; the output is in the fits - format * gas mass calibration ( @xmath6-factors ) which can vary with position * a dark matter package to allow for propagation of the wimp annihilation products and calculation of the corresponding synchrotron and @xmath0-ray skymaps * galprop  darksusy interface ( together with t. baltz ) will become publicly available soon * a dedicated website has been developed ( http://galprop.stanford.edu )     and 180@xmath7 vs.  galactic latitude .",

    "this is an update of the spectrum shown in @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the galprop code @xcite was created with the following aims : ( i ) to enable simultaneous predictions of all relevant observations including cr nuclei , electrons and positrons , @xmath0-rays and synchrotron radiation , ( ii ) to overcome the limitations of analytical and semi - analytical methods , taking advantage of advances in computing power , as cr , @xmath0-ray and other data become more accurate , ( iii ) to incorporate current information on galactic structure and source distributions , ( iv ) to provide a publicly - available code as a basis for further expansion .",
    "the first point is the most important : all data relating to the same system , the galaxy , must have an internal consistency .",
    "for example , one can not allow a model which fits secondary / primary ratios while not fitting @xmath0-rays or not being compatible with the known interstellar gas distribution .",
    "there are many simultaneous constraints , and to find one model satisfying all of them is a challenge , which in fact has not been met up to now .",
    "upcoming missions will benefit : galprop has been adopted as the standard for diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission for nasa s glast @xmath0-ray observatory , and is also made use of by the ace , ams , heat and pamela collaborations .",
