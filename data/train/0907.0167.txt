    "a simultaneous achieving of ( [ modal_c ] ) is rather an exception being equivalent to the generalised commutativity property @xmath17 however , as an approximation , modal damping is attractive since it is handled by the standard theory and numerics of hermitian matrices .",
    "the aim of this paper is to assess modal approximations of general damped systems .",
    "more precisely , we will derive spectral inclusion theorems for eigenvalues where the unperturbed system is modally damped .",

    "we will show that our ovals outdo classical gershgorin circles . a special case are overdamped systems the eigenvalues of which are particularly well behaved , there ovals reduce to intervals and inclusions of wielandt - hoffman type will be derived .",
    "finally , we will derive new calculable sufficient conditions for the overdampedness of a given system .",

    "instead of working with the matrix @xmath18 we may turn back to the original quadratic eigenvalue problem in the representation in the form ( see ( [ modal_transf ] ) and ( [ a_a0 ] ) ) @xmath40 the inverse @xmath41 @xmath42 exists , if @xmath43 which is implied by @xmath44 thus , @xmath45 where the set @xmath46 will be called _",

    "we note the obvious relation @xmath51 the quasi cassini ovals are qualitatively similar to the standard ones ; they can consist of one or two components ; the latter case occurs when @xmath48 is sufficiently small with respect to @xmath52 . in this case the ovals in ( [ dcassini ] ) are approximated by the disks @xmath53 ) , ( [ maxcm ] ) .",

    "the modally damped systems are so much simpler than the general ones that practitioners often substitute the true damping matrix by some kind of modal approximation. most typical such approximations in use are of the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 are chosen in such a way that @xmath62 be in some sense as close as possible to @xmath7 , for instance , @xmath63 = \\min,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is some convenient positive definite weight matrix .",

    "is obtained @xmath111    we have called @xmath112 _ a _ modal approximation to @xmath65 because the matrix @xmath65 is not uniquely determined by the input matrices @xmath113 .",
