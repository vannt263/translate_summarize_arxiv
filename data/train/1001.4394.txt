    "the emerging field of cold molecules is a very vibrant topic in physics and physical chemistry .",
    "the considerable interest in this topic is related to the properties of cold molecules and their many potential applications .",
    "cold molecules have been identified as attractive systems for ultrahigh - resolution spectroscopy @xcite , quantum information processing @xcite , for developing new time standards and testing fundamental physical theories such as the time variation of physical constants @xcite , the existence of a dipole moment of the electron @xcite , and for the measurement of parity violation @xcite . in chemistry ,",
    "cold molecules are essential tools to explore quantum - mechanical effects in chemical reactions .",
    "in contrast to atoms , molecules have a very complicated level structure that consists of vibrational and rotational states as well as electronic levels .",
    "this abundance of states is the main obstacle for direct laser cooling of molecules .",
    "usually , molecules do not provide the closed transitions required for cooling and non - destructive state - selective detection .",
    "this makes it impossible to perform direct spectroscopic measurements on _ single _ molecules  a standard technique in atomic physics .",
    "additional complications result from the small energy differences between the rotational levels , leading to a thermal distribution of the population over the molecules ro - vibrational states .    despite important achievements @xcite , the control of molecular states never caught up with that of atomic systems",
    ". however , there has been remarkable progress in the synthesis of ultra - cold alkali dimers from samples of ultra - cold atoms ; see e.g. , refs .  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , methods which enable the preparation of more diverse ( e.g.  polyatomic ) cold molecular species in their vibrational ground - states have been successfully demonstrated .",
    "these methods include : supersonic beam expansion followed by stark deceleration @xcite , optical stark deceleration @xcite , electrostatic velocity selection @xcite , collisional cooling in crossed molecular beams @xcite and buffer gas cooling @xcite .",
    "the vibrationally cold ( but rotationally hot ) states that result will be taken to be the starting point for the schemes described in this paper .",
    "the experimental advances which have enabled the production of these cold molecular states have inspired theoretical investigations of the cooling of molecules by laser pulses @xcite or even by coupling molecules to an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "bartana et al .",
    "@xcite used the electronic excited - state as a heat reservoir in order to cool the vibrational states of the electronic ground - state by means of short , shaped , laser pulses . in later work @xcite they employed state selective optical pumping , hiding",
    "the target state in a dynamically trapped state . through this ,",
    "bartana et al .  achieved a vibrational ground state population of 97% after only 25 vibration periods .",
    "a related scheme , investigated by schirmer @xcite , increased the vibrational ground - state population to a similar level .",
    "these efforts to cool the internal degrees of freedom focus on the widely spaced vibrational states of molecules . in ref .",
    "@xcite bartana et al .",
    "investigated the possibility of cooling the _ rotational _ degrees of freedom in a simplified model employing the same techniques .",
    "however , even though the results of their calculations are very promising , the model has limited application as it neglects the vibrational degree of freedom of the molecule .",
    "in contrast to neutral molecules , ionized molecules can be sympathetically cooled by trapping them alongside atomic ions in a paul trap . under these conditions ,",
    "state sensitive ultra - cold chemical reactions have been measured @xcite and high resolution spectroscopy has been demonstrated on small ensembles @xcite . despite these achievements , the rotational degrees of freedom",
    "could not be controlled , but they led to new laser cooling schemes for the internal states of molecules @xcite exploiting the unique properties of these systems .    in the present paper , we show that by means of purely coherent manipulations of internal states ( i.e.  rotational states ) , and by using sympathetic cooling of motional states , single molecular ions can be cooled close to their motional and rotational ground - state .",
    "the internal vibration of the molecule needs to be initially cold , in order for the final state to be cold in _ all _ its degrees of freedom .",
    "this initial state can be achieved using the existing methods described above .",
    "then the cooling of the internal molecular state is achieved in three steps : first a laser cooled atomic ion is trapped alongside the molecule and a common mode of vibration is used to prepare the molecule in its motional ground - state .",
    "next , using adiabatic passage methods @xcite , the thermal internal state of the molecule can be mapped onto the molecule s motion in an external trapping field with high fidelity . during this mapping process the internal ( rotational ) states are transferred to the ground - state whereas the molecule s motion is excited .",
    "finally , the molecule s motion is sympathetically cooled back into its ground - state using the common mode with a cooled atomic ion . by doing this without exciting other degrees of freedom , a molecule which is vibrationally , rotationally , and translationally cold",
    "can be obtained .",
    "the overall process is a kind of molecular `` heat pump '' : the heat energy in the rotational degree of freedom is transferred by the coherent processes to the motional degree of freedom .",
    "this heat energy is in turn transferred to the environment by means of conventional cooling techniques , e.g. side - band cooling : this ensures that the process is uni - directional .",
    "vogelius et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the cooling of molecular ions by coupling a single rotational state to the motion of the ion . by means of black - body radiation",
    "the population is pumped into the rotational ground - state resulting in a ground - state population of about 80% after a cooling time of the order of minutes . in this paper",
    "we focus on the cooling process by employing techniques from coherent control providing much faster and more efficient cooling .",
    "the result is a robust and highly efficient cooling process which enables the deterministic manipulation of the internal states of molecules .",
    "we will examine adiabatic passage schemes which exhibit high fidelity in conjunction with relaxed requirements on the experimental parameters compared to direct raman transitions .",
    "with cooling times of the order of milliseconds , and final ground - state populations of more than 92% , the proposed scheme provides a fast and efficient method for preparing molecules in their ro - vibrational ground - state .",
    "even though we focus here on the cooling of molecular rotational levels , the technique is also applicable to other multi - level systems .",
    "so the technique can also be employed in atoms with complicated level schemes , or more general ro - vibrational states of molecules .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:2 ] , we present the model used for our calculations . to find the best adiabatic passage process for our application we compare the results of numerical simulations for stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) , stark chirped raman adiabatic passage ( scrap ) and chirped adiabatic rapid passage ( carp ) in a @xmath0-type level system in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "we also choose parameter ranges which are relevant for a possible experimental implementation .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] contains the results for an extended level scheme , and in section [ sec : conclusion ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the model we employ in this paper is based on the states of a quantum mechanical rigid rotator which is a good approximation for the rotational states of small diatomic molecules .",
    "however , the techniques described here are applicable to most other level structures with the sole requirement that allowed raman transitions between the states involved exist . in general , the method can be applied to ro - vibrational states of molecules as well as zeeman and hyperfine levels . in order to simplify the discussion , and to avoid specializing to molecules with specific symmetries",
    ", we will not apply specific selection rules to the raman transitions involved .",
    "nevertheless , the results presented in this paper can be applied to a particular system by imposing the specific selection rules for that case with an appropriate relabelling of states .",
    "for example , we could utilize @xmath1 for linear molecules .",
    "we take the energy @xmath2 of the rotational levels of the electronic ground state to be @xmath3 , with the rotational quantum number @xmath4 and a rotational constant @xmath5 . in order to limit the number of levels in our calculations , only rotational levels up to a cut - off",
    "are considered , i.e.@xmath6 . for typical , light , diatomic molecules at room temperature only rotational states with @xmath7",
    "are significantly populated .",

    "the excited state can decay into this uncoupled state with a rate @xmath18 .",
    "the single molecule is trapped in a harmonic potential as provided by rf - traps for molecular ions .",
    "the quantized motion of the molecule in the trapping potential gives rise to an equally spaced ladder of motional states in addition to the internal states of the molecule .",
    "to take the molecule s motion into account , we use the standard notation @xmath19 with @xmath20 representing the states @xmath10 , @xmath21 and @xmath12 .",
    "the quantum number describing the motional state is @xmath22 . as discussed in the introduction , in order to prepare the molecule s motion in its ground - state , it is trapped alongside one or more atomic ions which can be directly laser cooled .",
    "the two types of ion form a crystal - like structure due to their mutual coulomb repulsion , which enables sympathetic cooling of the molecule . in experiments with two types of atomic ion , ground - state populations of better than 95% have been achieved @xcite . in the molecular case",
    ", the minimal system would be one trapped molecular ion and one trapped atomic ion . in this case",
    ", we find that due to the frequency splitting of the motional modes , one mode ( com or stretch mode ) can be singled out and used for the proposed scheme .",

    "note that we work in an interaction representation with explicit time - dependence removed , and keep both the resonant and non - resonant couplings .",
    "the reason for this is that in pursuing the adiabatic limit in section [ sec:3 ] we will consider `` strong '' rabi frequencies ( @xmath45 ) which do not allow us to make a second rwa on the hamiltonians for the sideband transitions .",
    "we start our calculations with a molecule in an internal thermal state such that it is already cooled in its internal vibrational mode ( e.g.  by the methods mentioned in the introduction ) and such that the excited state @xmath8 is not populated .",
    "we also assume that the molecule s vibrational motion in the trap has been cooled ( e.g.  by sympathetic sideband cooling @xcite ) so that only the manifold of rotational states @xmath46 are populated .",

    "stirap is widely used in the optical control of molecules @xcite where a stokes pulse and a pump pulse are used in a `` counter - intuitive '' order to transfer the population between two states .",
    "the main requirement for stirap is the two - photon resonance condition which corresponds to @xmath106 for a transition on a motional sideband ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : levelsystem ] ) .",
    "in addition to this the pulse area must be large , @xmath107 , and the delay between the stokes and pump pulse must be of the order of the pulse width , @xmath108 , to ensure the adiabatic evolution of the system .",
    "another constraint arises from the necessity to address particular motional sidebands .",
    "the narrow splitting of the motional states imposes the use of laser pulses with narrow bandwidth @xmath109 @xcite .",

    "the efficiency of stirap is compromised by the spontaneous decay @xmath118 , so the compensation of small rabi frequencies by long laser pulses is not an option .",
    "therefore , the efficiency of stirap in this parameter range is low and the population transfer is governed by optical pumping rather than coherent evolution .",
    "this is particularly visible in the plateau region for @xmath119 . in this regime",
    "the pulse delay is too large to sustain the adiabatic evolution of the system , which results in a net loss of the ground state population . highly efficient",
    ", fast stirap between motional states requires large motional frequencies which are beyond current ion - trap technology .",
    "we can try to suppress the excited - state population by detuning the raman transition from the excited state .",
    "however , it has been known for some time that detuning adversely affects the stirap process in the absence of decay @xcite . with decay present",

    "this can be moderated by increasing the detuning of the laser pulses . because the constraints on the pulse length are less severe than for stirap the population transfer can be faster with scrap . together with the far detuning this leads to a improved robustness against the detrimental effect of spontaneous decay @xcite .",
    "another way of achieving an adiabatic population transfer is the application of simultaneous pump and stokes pulses ( @xmath141 ) with one laser having a frequency chirp .",
    "this is a raman chirped adiabatic passage , sometimes called rcap @xcite , though here we refer to it as chirped adiabatic rapid passage ( in a @xmath0-system ) or carp . with this system",

    "the population which remained in the higher , coupled rotational states @xmath187 can be transferred into the ground - state by sympathetically cooling the molecule s motion and reapplying the cooling pulse sequence .",
    "using this approach the population of the ground - state can be even further increased from 92% to above 98.4% with a total loss into the uncoupled state of only 1.6% .",

    "the corresponding losses are less than @xmath192 for @xmath188 and @xmath193 for @xmath194 .    for large numbers of populated states",
    "the transfer efficiency can be estimated with the following equation : @xmath195 where @xmath89 is the transfer efficiency for the simple @xmath0-system , and @xmath196 is the initial population distribution ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "this agrees well with our numerical simulation of six rotational levels .",
    "starting from a vibrationally cold system , these values of the efficiency @xmath89 show that we can reach the motional and rotational ground - state of molecules @xcite . for a co@xmath173 ion with a rotational temperature of @xmath197k , the first 15 rotational levels are significantly occupied initially with a ground - state population of only 3% . by applying the carp state mapping with a detuning of @xmath178 and taking the selection rule @xmath198 into account the population of the two lowest lying states can be",

    "in this work we presented an efficient method to cool the internal states of molecules by means of coherent processes ( and sympathetic cooling ) thus suppressing the problematic spontaneous decay into uncoupled states . by coupling the internal molecular state to the motion of the molecule , that internal state can be mapped onto a motional state . utilizing this , the _ internal _ state is cooled close to its ground - state if the molecule s motion was initially reduced to the motional ground - state through sympathetic cooling .",
    "ultimately all the degrees of freedom of the molecule can be cooled by the application of sympathetic cooling to the final motional excitation . due to its high efficiency",
    "the method presented here is not only useful to cool the internal state , but can also be employed to detect the internal state of the molecule by measuring its motional state with an atom which is trapped alongside .",
    "we have studied various adiabatic methods for a range of laser pulse parameters which are relevant for an experimental implementation of this cooling scheme .",
    "the motion of the ion imposes restrictions on the dynamics of the population transfer process which severely limit the possible parameter range for the laser pulses . for the near - resonant method ( stirap ) ,",
    "population transfer efficiency is very low accompanied with a large population of the excited state .",
    "population losses can be suppressed , if far - detuned chirped adiabatic two - photon raman passage methods are employed .",
    "schemes that use chirped laser pulses ( carp ) , or self - induced adiabatic passage ( scrap / siarp ) by stark shifting the transition frequencies , turned out to be very efficient .",
    "when it comes to the comparison of carp and scrap the former method has the advantage of easy optimization since it has no dependence with respect to pulse shape .",
    "furthermore , for both methods , and unlike stirap , the resolved sideband condition imposes less severe constraints on the useful parameter space .",
    "the requirements for all three methods were derived with simulations for a @xmath0-system . using the results from this simple model",
    ", we were able to demonstrate the applicability of carp in systems with more than two rotational states .",
    "for far - detuned transitions , a high - fidelity population mapping from the internal to the motional degrees of freedom is possible .",
    "losses were very low and our simulations indicate that the fidelity can be further improved by detuning the laser pulses further from the transition .    in the scheme we propose here , each rotational level",
    "is coupled to the excited state by a laser .",
    "due to the large rotational level splitting of light molecules this means in turn that multiple lasers are required .",
    "the number of levels @xmath199 which have a population larger than the cut - off population @xmath200 , and therefore the number of required lasers , can be estimated as @xmath201 for small @xmath200 . even though the number of levels @xmath199 for molecules at room temperature can be of the order of 25 , for temperatures of a few kelvin this reduces to well below 10 states . in many experiments",
    "molecular ions can be prepared in low lying rotational states by employing photo - association or state selective photo - ionisation in conjunction with supersonic beam expansion or buffer - gas cooling .",
    "however , due to the interaction with black - body radiation and collisions the internal temperature quickly thermalises . by applying the scheme proposed here , this thermalisation can be suppressed to maintain the ground - state population .",
    "additionally , the state mapping can be employed to detect the internal states of the molecule in a non - destructive manner which is beneficial for high - resolution spectroscopy of molecules .    in conclusion , we have developed a fast scheme for cooling the internal states of single molecules by employing adiabatic passage methods which provide a high efficiency in conjunction with robustness against variations in the parameters of the involved laser pulses .",
