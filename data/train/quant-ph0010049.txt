    "the controversy regarding the completeness of quantum mechanics  @xcite was presented in the framework of entangled spin@xmath1 particles  @xcite .",
    "this context proved to be convenient for bell s development of an inequality to test the postulates of local realism  @xcite .",
    "recent quantum optics experiments , designed to test bell inequalities , involve pairs of photons that are produced from the vacuum state , generally by optical parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) .",
    "pdc offers significant advantages over the earlier atomic cascade approach to generating photon pairs  @xcite ; these advantages include conservation of energy ( hence correlated frequencies of the two photons ) , conservation of linear momentum ( hence correlated wavelengths and direction of propagation ) and conservation of angular momentum ( hence correlated polarizations ) , as well as near  simultaneity of the emission of the two photons in the pair  @xcite .",
    "in addition to pdc acting as a source of correlated pairs of photons , there exists a scheme for which the photon pairs are in a polarization ",
    "entangled state  @xcite .",
    "pdc has enabled accurate tests of local realism vs quantum theory to be performed  @xcite .",
    "it is common to treat the input state for optical bell inequality measurements as the singlet state @xmath2 corresponding to an entanglement of vertical ( @xmath3 ) and horizontal ( @xmath4 ) polarized photons in a net zero  angular  momentum state .",
    "however , pdc is not a perfect source of pairs of photons ; one must account for the higher  order contributions due to more than two photons . also , the time of emission of the correlated pair is random . these features of pdc will be shown to be accommodated in the group theoretic approach of applying an su(1,1 ) transformation to the vacuum state  @xcite .",
    "the bell inequality test is performed , first by producing the photon pairs via pdc , and then directing the photons through passive optical elements ( beam splitters , phase shifters , polarizer rotators ) .",
    "these passive optical elements mix two bosonic fields at each stage and conserve photon number ; such transformations are described as su(2 ) transformations  @xcite .",
    "thus , the input vacuum state is subjected to an overall unitary transformation which can be decomposed into a sequence of su(1,1 ) and su(2 ) transformations , to produce the final output state .",
    "this state is then subjected to photon coincidence measurements , and the constraints of local realism impose an upper bound on photon coincidence rates for various parameter choices .",
    "a violation of this upper bound corresponds to a violation of bell s inequality and , hence , a test of local realism .",
    "we shall see that it is natural to characterize bell inequality experiments in terms of unitary transformations and to identify the lie algebra which generates these transformations for particular bell inequality experiments .",
    "we show that ideal bell inequality experiments effect an su(1,1 ) transformation , which is distinct from the su(1,1 ) transformation that produces the photon pairs .",
    "distinct ideal bell inequality experiments can be identified with different su(1,1 ) subgroups in sp(8,@xmath5 ) .    in section  [ sec : background ]",
    ", we describe tests of bell s inequality and establish the mathematical framework necessary for studying such tests .",
    "the su(2 ) transformations for passive optical elements and the su(1,1 ) transformations for pdc are discussed . in section  [ sec : ideal ] , we treat the ideal test of a bell inequality by analyzing the experimental arrangement of an su(1,1 ) pdc transformation followed by su(2 ) passive optical elements .",
    "the result is that the ideal bell inequality test arises as an su(1,1 ) @xmath6 sp(8,@xmath0 ) transformation of the vacuum state with some freedom to choose the applicable su(1,1 ) transformation .",
    "an alternative realization of an ideal bell inequality test is presented in section  [ sec : realizations ] as well as an example of a post  selected form of testing bell s inequality .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] and include a brief discussion of the nature of the general su(1,1 ) coherent state involved in bell inequality tests .",
    "in the standard bell inequality test , a source produces a pair of entangled spin-@xmath1 particles .",
    "these two particles propagate in different directions and are detected by spatially separated detectors which can measure the spin state of each of the two particles along specified axes .",
    "an example of an entangled state is given by eq .",
    "( [ intro : singlet ] ) .",
    "we refer to the two spatially separated components ( channels ) as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the state may be subjected to simultaneous measurements of the spin states of @xmath7 and @xmath8 along preferred axes .",
    "the chsh inequality version of the bell inequality  @xcite introduces the figure of merit @xmath9 with @xmath10 describing measurement axes for system  @xmath7 , @xmath11 for system  @xmath8 and @xmath12 the correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( with values in the range @xmath13 $ ] ) .",
    "local realism places a bound of @xmath14 on @xmath15 , giving the chsh inequality , @xmath16 and quantum mechanics predicts a violation of this inequality for certain quantum states  @xcite . for example , using the singlet state ( [ intro : singlet ] ) with the values  @xcite @xmath17 one obtains a violation of the chsh inequality of @xmath18 .",
    "here we employ the chsh inequality to investigate bell inequality tests as unitary transformations .",
    "a detailed analysis of bell inequalities requires consideration of the clauser ",
    "horne formulation of the inequality  @xcite and treatment of loopholes in the various experimental tests  @xcite",
    ". however , these issues are not directly relevant to this analysis , and the chsh inequality suffices to consider an ideal bound on a system which is governed by local realism .",
    "although the bell inequality test was devised using two spin-@xmath1 particles , we may use a boson representation to realize an optical version of the experiment . in this case",
    "there are four boson field modes to consider , each with a corresponding annihilation operator : @xmath19 corresponding to the vertical polarization for the @xmath7 spatial mode , @xmath20 corresponding to the horizontal polarization for the @xmath7 spatial mode , and annihilation operators  @xmath21 for the vertical and horizontal polarizations for the @xmath8  spatial modes .",
    "there are thus four mutually  commuting boson  operator pairs @xmath22 , @xmath23 and their conjugates , which can be presented as @xmath24 these operators obey the usual boson commutation rules @xmath25=\\delta_{ij}\\ , , \\quad    [ \\hat{c}_i,\\hat{c}_j]=[\\hat{c}_i^{\\dagger},\\hat{c}_j^{\\dagger}]=0 \\ , .\\ ] ]    an optical test of bell s inequality can employ parametric down  conversion ( pdc ) , polarization rotation ( where the spin@xmath1 state corresponds to a polarization state of the photon ) , beam splitters , phase shifters and mirrors as stages of the processing of the quantum state .",
    "each of these stages can be represented mathematically as a unitary transformation provided that losses are neglected .",
    "the infinitesimal generators of these transformations consist of quadratic combinations of the operators  ( [ combining : c ] ) and ( [ combining : cdagger ] ) , of the form @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "a convenient expression for the correlation function in terms of this four  boson realization is  @xcite @xmath34 strictly speaking , this expression is applicable to the chsh inequality when the photon pair flux is sufficiently low that the probability of more than one pair of photons arriving at the detectors is negligible .",
    "the spontaneous generation of pairs by pdc permits a sufficiently short interval to be chosen , in principle , to ensure that higher  order terms ( beyond the vacuum and photon pairs ) can be neglected .",
    "the vacuum produces no coincidences and the coincidence rate is set to zero in this case .",
    "the normalization is trivial for the case of a single pair , with photons arriving at  @xmath7 and  @xmath8 detectors .",
    "the coincidence rate represented by  ( [ coincidence ] ) is appropriate for quantum optics experiments .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : ideal ] that the flux rate of photon pairs cancels via the denominator , and , therefore , the flux rate does not appear in calculations of bell s inequality .",
    "the algebra sp(8,@xmath31 ) contains many subalgebras which have physical significance in terms of quantum optics and bell inequality tests . in the following ,",
    "we identify certain subalgebras with optical transformations induced by beam splitters , phase shifters , polarization rotations , and pdcs .",

    "the above are just some of the su(2 ) subalgebras used to describe lossless , passive optical elements : elements for which the total number of input quanta equals the total number of output quanta .",

    "however , if post ",
    "selection is given by the projection @xmath96 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : projection ] ) , then the test becomes equivalent to the ideal test .",
    "it should be noted again that the realization of this projection relies on photodetectors which can distinguish between different multiple photon events , such as two photons in channel @xmath7 and zero in channel @xmath8 .    whereas the disadvantage of the ou ",
    "mandel scheme is the need for post  selection , an advantage is the relatively high flux of photon pairs from type ",
    "i pdc compared to the production of entangled  polarization pairs via pdc  @xcite . for applications of bell state measurements to quantum teleportation and other schemes , higher pair flux is an advantage .",
    "in studies of bell inequalities , it is common to assume from the outset that one is supplied with one of the four bell states  ( [ eq : bellstatebasis ] ) . in quantum optical experiments ,",
    "such states are generated from the vacuum state by an su(1,1 ) transformation corresponding to parametric down conversion ( pdc ) .",
    "local manipulations of the output state from the pdc are described by su(2 ) transformations . using these basic facts",
    ", we establish that bell inequality experiments , which manipulate four bosonic fields , are su(1,1 ) @xmath6 sp(8,@xmath0 ) transformations , and that distinct four  boson realizations of su(1,1 ) correspond to different experiments . for the post  selected bell inequality , a projection operator is necessary to recover the su(1,1 ) transformation equivalent to the ideal bell inequality test .",
    "this analysis is useful for a number of reasons .",
    "it is useful to know that an optical realization of the ideal bell inequality test , which begins with a vacuum state as a source , is described by a four  boson realization of su(1,1 ) to enable classification and comparison between differing tests of bell inequalities as well as to consider new tests . according to the formalism we establish",
    ", new optical tests of bell inequalities would arise as distinct realizations of su(1,1 ) @xmath6 sp(8,@xmath0 ) .",
    "the question of various distinct tests of local realism can thus be related to the mathematical question of distinct realizations of the subgroup su(1,1 ) in sp(8,@xmath0 ) and the transformations which relate these subgroups .",
    "this question may be relevant to continuous ",
    "variable approaches to tests of bell inequalities  @xcite where degenerate pdc and the one  boson realization  ( [ kdegen : generators ] ) are used .",
    "the employment of a unitary description of bell inequality tests is useful as it includes higher  order photon number contributions and incorporates the non  deterministic creation time for pairs of photons .",
    "it also establishes a scheme for classifying existing bell inequality tests and proposing new tests .",
    "in addition to the importance of bell inequalities , not only for testing local realism , but also for their relevance to quantum cryptography  @xcite , the approach employed in this paper can be extended to studying quantum teleportation  @xcite , quantum dense coding  @xcite and entanglement swapping  @xcite .",
    "these concepts and experiments in quantum information apply the bell states  ( [ eq : bellstatebasis ] ) and their measurements to larger systems .",
    "the application of group theoretical methods to such systems follows from the analysis in this paper and is under investigation .",
    "finally , the group theoretic approach establishes that the bell inequality apparatus , described as a unitary transformation , produces an output state which can be regarded as a generalized coherent state  @xcite ; these coherent states are distinct from the bi  pair ( four  boson ) coherent states investigated by bambah and agarwal  @xcite , as the relevant group is not a direct product su(1,1)@xmath192su(1,1 ) .",
    "the output coherent state is the transformed vacuum state .",
    "however , the vacuum state  @xmath193 is not a lowest weight state for the relevant realizations of su(1,1 ) to describe bell inequality tests .",
    "the representation containing the vacuum state is certainly reducible .",
    "however , the description of the state as a generalized coherent state does provide a useful method for thinking about the state which arrives at the photodetectors . in this way of thinking ,",
    "the state may be characterized by probability distributions for measurements , and the correlation function  ( [ eq : expectationc(a , b ) ] ) can be regarded as being related to a covariance of a joint probability distribution for @xmath194 and  @xmath195 for this generalized coherent state .",
    "the elegance of the calculations in section  [ sec : ideal ] of the bell inequality violations suggests that there is something natural about considering these generalized coherent states in such studies .",
