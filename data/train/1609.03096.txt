    "an electron moving in a solid ( ordered or otherwise ) polarizes its surroundings , and dresses itself with bosonic excitations which include electronic spin and charge fluctuations , electronic orbital fluctuations , and phonons .",
    "the result is a _ polaron _ ; the best - known example is an electron dressed by a combination of optical and acoustic phonons .",
    "the phonon - dressed polaron is of enduring interest for two main reasons :    \\(i ) polarons are believed to play a key role in determining the physics of many materials ; and    \\(ii ) it provides a target for any theory of quasiparticles which tries to span the weak , intermediate , and strong coupling regimes .",
    "this has given the subject an interesting history ( briefly described in section ii ) , closely connected to many of the important developments in many - body physics and quantum field theory .",
    "for most of this history , attention has focused on a specific kind of `` diagonal '' coupling between the density of electrons ( this is a diagonal operator in a real space formulation ) and phonon displacements ; the latter can be local or longer - range , as reviewed in section ii .",
    "such models are now well understood , and have led to a `` polaron paradigm '' in which diagonal interactions , no matter what their form , do not lead to any kind of sharp transition in the polaron properties as the coupling strength is increased ( eg .",
    ", the effective mass increases smoothly with coupling , up to infinite coupling strength ) .",
    "however one may also have non - diagonal couplings to the bath , only acting when the particle hops between sites ( which in the continuum limit couple to the particle momentum ) .",
    "we now know that such couplings lead to results very different from the classical polaron paradigm .",
    "this was first shown in ref . for a specific model with a non - diagonal coupling ( the ssh model ) ; a sharp transition was found between the behavior at weak coupling and that at strong coupling .",
    "as we shall see here , this transition persists even when we add diagonal interactions to the non - diagonal ones .",
    "these results appear to be rather general , indicating that the old polaron paradigm needs to be replaced by a rather different one incorporating the interplay between diagonal and non - diagonal couplings .",
    "this is what we do in this paper .",
    "the results are not just of theoretical interest - they will force a substantial re - evaluation of our picture of polarons in many physical systems .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section ii discusses models containing both diagonal and non - diagonal terms , and briefly reviews previous work .",
    "section iii describes our method , the bold diagrammatic monte carlo ( bdmc ) and the momentum average ( ma ) approximation .",
    "the former method is also discussed in appendix a , which is an integral part of the paper .",
    "sections iv and v give the main results ; section iv discusses the results when only non - diagonal ssh terms are present , highlighting the transition in the polaronic properties .",
    "section v adds diagonal terms , and shows how the transition is influenced by these terms .",
    "section vi summarizes the new picture of the polaron that comes out of these results , in the form of an effective band theory leading to a new kind of polaron paradigm - readers looking for a quick summary should go to this section , which also discusses experimental applications .",
    "we would like to study a model which brings out the main features of both diagonal and non - diagonal couplings without being too complicated . in this section",
    "we first develop the model , and then discuss a few simple key features it possesses , at the same time recalling some of the main results found over the years .",
    "we begin by formulating the dual coupling model in a fairly general way . in a site basis",
    "we start from a hamiltonian @xmath1 describing the hopping , with amplitude @xmath2 , of a particle between sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 of a lattice , in the presence of a bosonic bath having a single branch of excitations of frequency @xmath5 ( here , @xmath6 labels the quantum numbers of the bosons ; for example , we can choose @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a momentum and @xmath9 a polarization ; or we can choose @xmath10 , with @xmath3 a site index again ) .",
    "both the on - site energy @xmath11 and the hopping matrix element @xmath2 are modulated by ( i.e. , are functionals of ) the boson variables @xmath12 . if we are dealing with lattice phonons , the modulation is through the site displacement operators @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the ionic mass .",
    "this generates the diagonal couplings ( modulations of @xmath11 ) and non - diagonal couplings ( modulations of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the form of ( [ ho - site ] ) is quite general - the lattice may take any form ( ordered or disordered ) , as may the various coupling terms .",
    "to say more we must specify how @xmath11 and @xmath2 depend on the bosonic variables",
    ". this dependence can take many forms for different physical systems . in what follows",
    ", we will assume that we are dealing with a periodic crystalline lattice , and that the bosons in questions are lattice phonons ; crystal momentum is then a good quantum number .",
    "let us expand the hamiltonian ( [ ho - site ] ) in terms of the phonon variables @xmath15 .",
    "then the diagonal interaction terms are produced by expanding the on - site energy : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the 1-phonon diagonal coupling , @xmath18 the 2-phonon diagonal coupling , and so on .",
    "this diagonal term arises simply from the polarization of the background lattice by the particle - for electrons , it is essentially a coulomb interaction effect .",
    "the non - diagonal couplings are produced by expanding @xmath19 in phonon variables .",
    "this is more subtle , since the hopping matrix element arises from electron tunneling , and so depends exponentially on the phonon displacement .",
    "often this dependence is written as @xmath20   \\label{t - ph}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 has the dimension of energy ; but this form generates only one part of the multi - phonon interaction terms ( which can also appear directly in the exponent ) .",
    "however since we are only interested in the linear term , we expand ( [ t - ph ] ) to linear order in phonon variables , so that @xmath22   \\label{t - ph - lin}\\ ] ] the physical meaning of this peierls term is obvious from the derivation - the phonons modulate the distance between the lattice ions , and this modulates the tunneling amplitude of the electron between sites .",
    "as we shall see , the effective range of the @xmath2 , once it is renormalized by the coupling to phonons , can be significantly greater than a single lattice spacing .    in this paper we will deal exclusively with ordered lattices .",
    "we then fourier transform the starting hamiltonian ( [ ho - site ] ) ; and as further restrictions , we will ( i ) keep only the linear coupling to phonons ; ( ii ) assume a single optical phonon branch , with polarization index suppressed and frequency @xmath23 ; and ( iii ) assume the lattice has no impurities , defects , surfaces , or other inhomogeneities that break translational invariance .",
    "the hamiltonian describing such problems then has the general structure : @xmath24 where we suppress the electronic spin variable .",
    "here @xmath25 is the sum of the fourier - transformed diagonal and non - diagonal terms , @xmath26 are electron and phonon creation operators , @xmath27 is the electron momentum and momentum sums are over the first brillouin zone .",
    "we assume @xmath28 lattice sites and let @xmath29 .",
    "the elimination of both acoustic phonons and higher - order phonon couplings restricts the applicability of ( [ h - pol ] ) in the real world . in section",
    "vi we return to these approximations and their consequences .",
    "splitting @xmath25 into its diagonal and non - diagonal parts , we have @xmath30 where the diagonal coupling @xmath31 depends only on the phonon momentum @xmath32 , while the non - diagonal coupling @xmath33 depends explicitly on the particle momentum @xmath34 .    _ the dual `` h / ssh '' model _ : so far these results are purely formal . in most of the rest of this paper",
    "we wish to obtain explicit results for the polaron properties in a model which combines two specific forms for the diagonal and non - diagonal couplings .",
    "we therefore consider a 1-dimensional chain with lattice constant @xmath35 , and a bare hopping term @xmath36 , i.e. , constant nearest - neighbor hopping only .",
    "we choose the phonons to be a set of einstein phonons of frequency @xmath37 .",
    "the non - interacting part of @xmath38 in ( [ h - pol ] ) is then @xmath39 giving two characteristic energy scales , @xmath40 and @xmath37 .",
    "for the diagonal electron - phonon coupling we use a simple on - site holstein coupling,@xcite so that @xmath41 with no dependence on momentum at all . for the non - diagonal coupling",
    "we use the so - called su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) form,@xcite which describes the modulation of the hopping term , viz . ,",
    "@xmath42 which in momentum space gives a coupling @xmath43   \\label{v2-a}\\ ] ] and we have introduced 2 new energy scales , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    we see that if we scale everything in terms of @xmath40 , there are 3 independent parameters in this `` h / ssh '' model .",
    "the adiabaticity parameter is : @xmath46 so that when @xmath47 , the phonon dynamics is considered as slow ( and the electron dynamics is fast ) .",
    "one can also define dimensionless parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with dimensionless ratio @xmath50 .",
    "however , a better understanding of the physics is obtained by defining @xmath51 whose ratio is now @xmath52 . along with @xmath53 ,",
    "these dimensionless parameters determine the behavior of this model at zero temperature .",
    "this is the simplest model one can look at for a polaronic system with both diagonal and non - diagonal couplings .",
    "it is something of a toy model and it ignores acoustic phonons .",
    "nevertheless it is good enough to reveal the main features of an entirely new behavior for the polaron , one quite different from the polaronic paradigm described above .",
    "how much these general features will persist in more general models is a question we address at the end of the paper .",
    "a great deal is known about the effect of the coupling @xmath54 on polaron dynamics , much less about @xmath55 , and still less about the effect of a combination of the two .",
    "the main results that have so far been established are as follows .",
    "\\(i ) _ diagonal terms _ : as noted above , many models with different diagonal couplings have been studied .",
    "the most famous examples are the holstein model@xcite ( where , as just noted , @xmath56 , a constant ) and the frhlich model , @xcite where the form of @xmath31 depends on the spatial dimension and on whether we deal with a lattice or a continuous medium model ) .",
    "other examples include the rashba - pekar model,@xcite breathing - mode ( bm ) models,@xcite and various models with displacement potential coupling.@xcite a variety of theoretical methods to study them were developed in the period from 1940 to 1970 , including perturbation expansions in the interaction , @xcite semiclassical approximations @xcite , and path integral techniques.@xcite the main aim was to understand the behavior of the polaron as the strength of the diagonal coupling @xmath31 was increased .",
    "indeed , the problem was ( and still is ) regarded as providing a key test of non - perturbative methods , and thus of interest well beyond solid - state physics .",
    "more recently , other methods have been developed , notably the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite and the momentum average ( ma ) approximations.@xcite the predictions of all of these methods can now be checked by a wide variety of numerical techniques , including exact diagonalization , variational methods , various types of quantum monte carlo simulations , and in one dimension , by density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) methods .",
    "the literature on all this is now enormous.@xcite    these diagonal models all have certain broad features in common . for weak coupling",
    ", there is typically very little phonon dressing , and the polaron properties are only slightly renormalized .",
    "this weak coupling regime is sometimes called the _ large polaron _ regime ( although that term may be more appropriate for continuous models ) . as the coupling is increased",
    ", there is a crossover to the _ small polaron _",
    "regime , where a robust polarization cloud is formed , and the electronic properties are strongly renormalized .",
    "the effective mass then increases rapidly with coupling ( eg .",
    ", exponentially fast in the holstein model ) . for a long time",
    "there was significant confusion over the idea that in this strong - coupling regime the polaron might become self - trapped ( i.e. localized ) , although it is now clear that such self - trapping is impossible in a clean system for any finite coupling . disorder in real systems can of course localize polarons , particularly when they are heavy ; but this is a different effect .",
    "another related , and long - standing controversy , was over whether there is a sharp transition or a smooth crossover between the two regimes .",
    "this question was settled by the work of gerlach and lwen @xcite who showed that for diagonal models having gapped bosonic modes , sharp transitions in the polaronic properties are impossible ; all physical quantities must vary smoothly with coupling strength .",
    "we note that the so - called self - trapping transition , which has in the past often been asserted to exist at some finite value of the coupling , is actually typically an artefact of numerical approximations , arising when the effective bandwidth is decreasing rapidly with increasing coupling constant .",
    "thus we see that from all of this work a general consensus has emerged for the diagonal coupling model , both on the essential physics and on the detailed quantitative picture .",
    "this is the `` _ polaron paradigm _ '' ; as conventionally understood , it involves a smooth crossover between weak and strong coupling , and between large and small polaron behavior , with no sharp transition of any kind ; and for a clean system , no `` self - trapping '' or localization of the polaron on any particular site .",
    "\\(ii ) _ non - diagonal terms _",
    ": much less work has been done on the non - diagonally coupled model , and most of this has been in the context of applications to systems like polyacetylene ( the ssh model @xcite ) and other polyacenes , @xcite as well as excimers , @xcite mx chains,@xcite and the cuprate superconductors.@xcite most theoretical studies of the single polaron in such models have been fairly recent , and we can separate them into two categories .    first , several studies have argued that in dual coupling models , having both diagonal and non - diagonal interactions , one can discern a self - trapping transition line in the 2-dimensional plane of the 2 couplings .",
    "evidence cited for this has typically come from variational analyses , using either a toyozawa ansatz @xcite or a global - local ansatz @xcite .",
    "there are also perturbative analyses @xcite , supplemented by exact diagonalization studies @xcite on very small ( 4-site ) lattices , that have claimed evidence for a crossover ( not a transition ) between large and small polaron regimes as a function of a non - diagonal ssh coupling ( note that refs . and have non - diagonal coupling to acoustic rather than optical phonons ) .",
    "second , a few papers have looked at the entanglement between the polaronic particle and the phonon bath as a function of the coupling constants - this was first done for the holstein model,@xcite and then for the ssh model.@xcite in the pure holstein model the entanglement increases smoothly during the crossover between the large and small polaron limits ( this is described as a cliff - like transition by zhao et al . , @xcite but in fact their results show only a smooth change in the entanglement ) .",
    "stojanovi and vanevi then found , in the ssh model , a non - analyticity in the entanglement as a function of the ssh coupling,@xcite but they then argued that this did not signal any kind of transition in the polaronic properties ( in particular , no change in the ground state ) , but rather a loss of coherence of the polaron .    in sections",
    "iv and v we will demonstrate that the physics is very different from that proposed by these earlier analyses .",
    "in fact there really is a sharp transition line in the dual coupling parameter plane , but it has nothing to do with any kind of phase transition or even a crossover between large and small polarons , or to a self - trapped state ; nor is it in the same part of the parameter space as the transitions claimed in the previous work .",
    "instead , it is associated with a change in the ground state , coming from a continuous evolution of the band structure as a function of the non - diagonal coupling .",
    "the @xmath0 polaron effective mass actually diverges along the transition line - but this is simply because of the shift of the ground state momentum ; the bandwidth is finite even at the transition .",
    "thus , the polaron is mobile everywhere in the parameter plane , even on the critical line .",
    "the crossover between large and small polarons turns out to be entirely associated with the diagonal part of the coupling - the non - diagonal coupling plays no role in this .",
    "sections iv - v gives full details of the results , and section vi describes the new picture that emerges from them .",
    "one reason we are confident in the accuracy of the results discussed herein is that we have been able to benchmark them against results found with the extremely powerful diagrammatic monte carlo ( dmc ) method invented by prokofev , svistunov and tupitsyn.@xcite in the current work we have augmented this method with an improved version , the bold diagrammatic monte carlo ( bdmc ) method , and we have also used the much faster momentum averaging ( ma ) approximation . in what follows we describe how they are applied to the present problem - technical details for the bdmc method are relegated to the appendix .",
    "we also say a little about perturbation theory - this turns out to work well only in the extreme anti - adiabatic regime when @xmath57 .    in ref .",
    ", results were reported for the ssh model using the above methods and also the limited phonon basis exact diagonalization ( lpbed ) method.@xcite the agreement between the lpbed , dmc , bdmc and ma results was found to be excellent , and we expect this to also be true for the present dual - coupling model because all these methods also work well for the holstein model .      for perturbative work , we write @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the sum of all self - energy graphs containing @xmath60 internal boson lines . both the rayleigh - schrodinger and wigner - brillouin versions of perturbation theory are then applied . in rayleigh - schrdinger ( rs )",
    "perturbation theory it is well - known @xcite that for polaron models with einstein phonons and @xmath61 , the first order contribution to @xmath62 exhibits an unphysical maximum at some momentum @xmath63 , and an unphysical divergent energy at larger momenta .",
    "because of this , we can only calculate the ground state energy and the effective mass if the ground - state is located at @xmath0 . at second order ,",
    "the unphysical maximum is eliminated and so is the divergent negative ground state energy , but for @xmath61 one finds instead a positive divergent energy at larger momentum .    in wigner - brillouin ( wb )",
    "perturbation theory , where the polaron energy is approximated using the implicit equation @xmath64 , no singular values for @xmath62 are found anywhere in the brillouin zone .",
    "wb is also useful as a consistency check for any numerical code : if electron lines are not dressed , and only contributions of up to two phonon lines are allowed , the resulting self - energy must converge to @xmath65 . since the polaron energy @xmath62 is the lowest pole of the green s function @xmath66^{-1}$ ] , with these restrictions any numerical results must coincide with wb .",
    "the ma technique is a non - perturbative approximation which has been applied successfully to a number of polaron problems .",
    "@xcite it sums all diagrams in the self - energy expansion , up to exponentially small contributions which are discarded .",
    "the ma self - energy is then expressed in closed form as a continued fraction , and evaluates this very efficiently .",
    "ma can be systematically improved@xcite so that its convergence can be assessed .",
    "it can also be cast in variational terms , as keeping contributions only from processes consistent with a certain structure of the phonon cloud . in its simplest , original formulation ( already surprisingly accurate for the holstein model )",
    ", the phonon cloud can be arbitrarily far from the electron and contain arbitrarily many phonons , but its size is limited to one site.@xcite for the edwards model@xcite  another model describing boson - modulated hopping  it was shown that to correctly describe the polaron dynamics , the minimum extent of the cloud is over three adjacent sites ( again , an arbitrary number of bosons is allowed at each site , and the particle can be arbitrarily far away from the cloud).@xcite    the ma results presented here have been generated using a straightforward generalization of the work in ref . . on general grounds , we expect it to be accurate if @xmath53 is not too small ; if phonons are energetically expensive , having them spread over many sites becomes very unlikely .",
    "of course , one can generalize ma to allow for more extended clouds , but the calculations become rather cumbersome .",
    "as shown below , the ma results produced here are quantitatively quite accurate as long as @xmath67 or so .",
    "note that we are using here what is technically called a ma@xmath68 method , which does not allow additional phonons to exist away from the polaron cloud . as a result",
    ", it can not describe the polaron @xmath69 one - phonon continuum , expected to appear at an energy @xmath37 above the polaron ground - state energy .",
    "ma properly captures this continuum for ma@xmath70 or higher level approximations , which include these states amongst those kept in the variational space.@xcite however , here we are concerned with the polaron band which lies below this continuum , and this ma version is already sufficient to describe it accurately , and to allow us to efficiently evaluate various trends .",
    "the bdmc method @xcite is an elaboration of the earlier diagrammatic monte carlo ( dmc ) algorithm.@xcite both belong to a category of unbiased computational methods , in which no assumptions are made about the solution or the type of diagrams that contribute most to the final answer .",
    "instead , all the diagrams are summed using stochastic sampling , and the result is exact within the statistical error bars .",
    "the dmc method was further developed to study the frhlich polaron , @xcite the holstein polaron@xcite and the spin polaron , @xcite amongst others .",
    "recently , it was also extended to many - polaron problems.@xcite    the method is formulated in imaginary time , where all diagrams are real functions of the internal lines . for diagonal coupling models , with @xmath71 , this removes any sign problem because in any self - energy diagram all emitted bosons are reabsorbed , so the vertices contribute a positive factor @xmath72 irrespective of the topology of the diagram . in this case",
    "their sum is convergent , and success is guaranteed .    for models with non - diagonal couplings @xmath73 , however , this is no longer necessarily true .",
    "hermiticity of the hamiltonian guarantees that @xmath74 , so if we consider the vertex product @xmath75 for a phonon line with momentum @xmath76 , its contribution is positive only if @xmath77 , _",
    "i.e. _ , if this phonon line is not crossed by other phonon lines . at first sight , it looks as if these contributions are complex , not real ; however , this is not the case because of symmetries .",
    "for example , for our dual - coupling h / ssh model , a purely imaginary contribution comes from diagrams where an odd number of phonon lines are either emitted by a holstein process and absorbed by a ssh process , or vice - versa .",
    "one can check that the contribution of such a diagram is canceled by that of its time - reversed pair . only diagrams with an even number of both holstein and of ssh vertexes survive .",
    "these have real expressions , but diagrams with crossed phonon lines can now have either sign .    thus we see that for @xmath78 , our model has a sign problem .",
    "it is not a severe problem because at least all the non - crossed diagrams are positive , but it makes it desirable to perform partial summations of diagrams , which may further mitigate it .",
    "this idea gave rise to the bdmc algorithm , in which free propagator lines are replaced by `` bold '' lines which already include some of the self - energy contributions .",
    "this is done in an iterative fashion , with proper care to avoid double counting of diagrams .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , our results reported in ref . and here are the first bdmc results for a single polaron problem ; in the appendix we explain in more detail how these calculations were done .",
    "before looking at the results when we have both couplings in the system , we examine each model separately .",
    "the physics of the diagonal holstein model is well - known - our purpose in discussing it here is to demonstrate the accuracy of the methods .",
    "we then examine the ssh model using the same methods , and discuss the physics around the critical coupling where the transition takes place , and the physical mechanism which causes the transition .",

    "the phonons have not gone away , of course , but for this lowest polaron band @xmath170 , since there are no lower states for the polaron to decay to . for the ssh model",
    "the transition at @xmath123 occurs because @xmath169 has a negative sign - the physical reason for this is that the phonon increases one bond length , but decreases the other ( cf .",

    "the physics here is intrinsically more complicated because one can imagine a wide variety of scenarios , depending on the relative sizes and signs of the different terms",

    "there is only one transition in the regime we have studied , where we assume that @xmath53 is not too small - the reason for this was discussed above .",
    "but clearly these results constitute just the tip of the iceberg as far as possible different behaviors are concerned , and it will be interesting to study different off - diagonally coupled models , having different forms for @xmath171 .",
    "in any real polaronic system there will generically be both diagonal and non - diagonal couplings between the electrons and the phonons ( or whatever other kind of bosonic excitation is involved ) .",
    "thus it is crucial to know how the competing ( and very different ) effects coming from each coupling end up working together . in what follows",
    "we investigate a combined `` holstein + ssh '' model , with both @xmath85 and @xmath109 finite .",
    "note that even though eqs .",
    "( [ v1-g ] ) and ( [ v2-a ] ) suggest that the results depend on the sign of @xmath191 , this sign is in fact irrelevant .",
    "this is because , as we noted when discussing the sign problem , all contributions with odd powers in either @xmath44 and/or @xmath45 cancel out . thus the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath109 are sufficient to fully characterize the couplings in this model .",
    "before discussing our results , it is worthwhile trying to guess what might be the result of combining the couplings . if we take the effective band idea seriously , then one can argue that ( i ) the main effect of the diagonal coupling is to simply reduce the bandwidth of the `` @xmath192 '' bare band , i.e. , to severely renormalize the nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath40 down to @xmath168 ; and ( ii ) the main effect of the non - diagonal coupling is to create longer - range hopping terms of the form @xmath193 .",
    "thus everything will now depend on the relative strength of these terms - if we imagine first putting in the non - diagonal term , to create the long - range hoppings , and then add the diagonal term , we expect that not only will @xmath40 be renormalized down to @xmath168 , but that there will also be a reduction of the higher @xmath175 , for @xmath194",
    ". note that if the higher @xmath175 are renormalized down by the same factor as the renormalization of @xmath40 to @xmath168 , the critical line @xmath138 will be unchanged as a function of @xmath53 : there will only be an overall weakening of all hopping amplitudes .",
    "however one can also imagine a scenario where the higher @xmath175 are less strongly reduced than @xmath40 - the critical coupling @xmath138 will then be reduced from its value when there is no diagonal coupling .",
    "conversely , if the @xmath175 are more strongly reduced , we expect @xmath138 to increase .",

    "the mass does _ not _ become very large for large coupling @xmath109 .",

    "\\(iii ) _ critical surface _ : the position of the critical surface depends only weakly on the adiabaticity parameter @xmath53 for sections with constant @xmath85 , although varying @xmath109 can change things rapidly , as shown in fig .",

    "further work needs to be done to clarify this in the adiabatic limit .",
    "we see that it is useful to think of the physics of the dual - coupled model in terms of this critical surface .",

    "\\(iv ) _ shape of lowest band _ : this question is answered if we look at the bandshape . for diagonal coupling",
    "only , the shape of the lowest polaron band will not be strongly affected by the coupling to the phonons if @xmath220 ( in one dimension )",
    ". the band will narrow as we increase the coupling , and the @xmath192 form will be weakly distorted by higher - order phonon terms , but @xmath221 will simply decrease smoothly as we increase the effective coupling , and the bottom of the band will remain at @xmath0 .    when we have non - diagonal couplings ,",
    "large longer - range hoppings are generated , which radically alter the band shape .",
    "this happens even when @xmath57 ( cf .",

    "to come from the studies recounted here is that , provided the phonon excitations do not overlap the lowest band ( i.e. , assuming @xmath222 ) , we can understand all of the numerical results for the lowest polaron band in terms of a polaron band energy @xmath62 characterized by a set of effective hopping parameters @xmath223 ( compare discussion in section iv.b , and eq .",

    "what this means is that unless @xmath239 or less , the effective band energy @xmath240 will differ very little from the exact @xmath62 that one finds in either an exact numerical calculation , or in experiments .",

    "thus the form given above for @xmath245 constitutes a hypothesis for the results of both experiments and non - perturbative numerical work , and is thus in principle testable . the key result in the present work , as we saw in section iv.b ,",
    "is that all of the features found here in the dual coupling model can be understood in terms of the behavior of the @xmath242 defined in ( [ t - n ] ) ; the following aspects are particularly important :    \\(a ) if we only have diagonal couplings in the model , then only @xmath230 exists in the sum of eq .",

    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) , where @xmath96 in the holstein model ; the distortion of @xmath62 away from a simple cosine form , caused by the continuum states , is quite small even when @xmath53 is as small as @xmath207 .",

    "the quasiparticle band will be accurate except for very small @xmath37 .",
    "\\(b ) introducing a non - diagonal coupling generates the @xmath231 with @xmath250 ; with increased coupling strength , they become steadily more important . if their signs are negative , a transition to a new polaron with finite @xmath106 is eventually achieved , once @xmath251 outweighs @xmath230 ; as @xmath252 increases further , @xmath253 .",
    "a key result comes out of the h / ssh model , where we saw that increasing the diagonal coupling @xmath85 , while keeping the non - diagonal coupling @xmath109 constant , suppresses the lowest - order hopping term @xmath168 faster than it does the higher terms @xmath254 , etc .",
    "this then makes it easier for the system to make the transition ( i.e. , it then happens for a smaller value of @xmath109 ) .",
    "the renormalized band , now parametrized in terms of the @xmath255 simply evolves in shape as @xmath109 increases . for any finite diagonal @xmath85 ,",
    "the bandwidth remains finite , no matter what is the non - diagonal @xmath109 .",
    "\\(c ) the transition line in no way marks any kind of quantum critical point , or collapse of the bandwidth .",
    "it simply marks the locus of points where the ground state momentum starts to shift away from zero .",
    "the renormalized bandwidth is never zero ( see the plots of @xmath62 in figs . [ fig2]-[fig4 ] , [ fig7 ] , and [ fig8 ] ) ; although the @xmath0 effective mass diverges along the transition line , this is simply because @xmath0 then marks a point of inflection of the dispersion relation @xmath62 , at which @xmath256 .",
    "the renormalized adiabaticity ratio @xmath243 also is finite at the transition point .",
    "we have already remarked above that the transition found here is completely unconnected with the rapid crossover found in the polaronic bandwidth as @xmath85 is increased - indeed there is never a transition as a function of @xmath85 .",
    "it also seems unlikely that anything in particular should happen to the electron - phonon entanglement at the transition we have found , since the effective band structure is varying continuously , and certainly for @xmath257 , nothing special happens to the mixing between the polaronic band and the higher energy continuum . in this connection",
    "we note that ref .",
    "finds some sort of transition in the entanglement between the polaron and the phonons , however we believe that what they have found is unconnected to the transition discussed here . this is because unlike what we find , their transition only occurs for sufficiently small @xmath53 , and even when present it is at different values of the coupling .",
    "we emphasize that one expects to see rather complicated effects when the lowest polaron quasiparticle band begins to overlap with the optical phonon - at this point level - crossing and real transitions become possible , with a large scale reorganization of states at the top of the polaron band .",
    "this is not a quantum phase transition , at least in the conventional sense of the term ( indeed , if one applied the term to describe this overlap of states for a single quasiparticle , it could also be applied to describe a wide variety of chemical and nuclear reactions , which would completely divest it of its original significance ) .",
    "all the concrete results found in sections iv and v were for the dual h / ssh model .",
    "however this model is still fairly specialized ; it involves only couplings linear in the phonon variables , and couples electrons to gapped optical phonons only .",
    "how general are such results , and what might they have to do with experiments on real systems ?",
    "let us look at these questions in turn .",
    "we can obviously ask what happens if ( i ) we go to more general models with combined diagonal and non - diagonal couplings , and ( ii ) if we also include acoustic phonons , and even perhaps higher - order phonon terms , such as the quadratic couplings in eq .",
    "( [ diag ] ) .",
    "once we look at the system in terms of the effective band hamiltonian , it becomes clear that there is almost certainly a lot more interesting physics to be revealed in dual coupling models of this kind .",
    "this is because there is no reason in principle why one can not imagine a destabilization of the @xmath258 groundstate to other ground states in which , for example , the @xmath259 hopping term dominates ( which could , as @xmath259 began to dominate over @xmath168 , have a @xmath260 or @xmath261 ) . in this way one can envisage a hierarchy of states , each having a different groundstate momentum , with critical lines / surfaces existing between them . clearly , to see this full complexity",
    ", one would have to begin by allowing modifications of the form of the diagonal and non - diagonal couplings @xmath262 , thereby exploiting the full freedom allowed by the momentum dependence of each - the holstein and ssh coupling forms are merely the simplest that one can imagine .",
    "one way to get more interesting physics of this kind would be looking for non - diagonal couplings @xmath263 with longer - range in real space , i.e. , with a more sharply - peaked behavior in momentum space .",
    "thus a fairly clear prediction arising from our effective hamiltonian is that of possible multiple `` effective band '' transitions as one varies the non - diagonal couplings .",
    "another possibility , recently demonstrated in a model combining ssh and bm coupling,@xcite appears when the diagonal coupling is also longer - range . in such cases ,",
    "interference between the two couplings can lead to additional renormalization of @xmath40 and even change its sign .",
    "for example , in the limit @xmath57 of ref . , this occurs through processes where ssh coupling moves the electron to a neighboring site while emitting a phonon at the original site , and then bm coupling absorbs that phonon without changing the electron location ( the order of the two processes can be reversed and the contributions add up ) .",
    "this generates an additional contribution to @xmath168 whose sign is controlled by the product of the two couplings .",
    "if it is negative and if its magnitude is large enough , one expects to see a second transition to a @xmath264 .",
    "indeed , this was observed in ref . .",
    "the way in which any coupling to acoustic phonons and phonon pair excitations might affect these results is an interesting question .",
    "we tend to believe that they will only further renormalize the effective band energy @xmath240 , as well as introduce dissipative processes for arbitrarily low energy , but that they will not alter the basic result that non - diagonal coupling to optical phonons can reorganize the band and change the ground - state momentum",
    ". however , this question merits further study .",
    "finally , it is now known that even small non - linear coupling to phonons , of the holstein type ( i.e. local in real space ) has significant effects both on the physics of the single polaron,@xcite and at finite carrier concentrations.@xcite it should be clear from the above discussion that such non - linear terms in either kind of coupling may open additional channels to generate longer - range hoppings . whether this can lead to qualitatively different behavior from that discussed above for linear couplings is another question that merits further study .",
    "so far , we have not discussed the experimental relevance of our work .",
    "the main reason is that , apart from a few notable exceptions,@xcite both computational efforts to calculate these couplings and the models used to extract such couplings from fits of experimental measurements tend to focus on a pure model , _",
    "i.e. _ either on only diagonal or only non - diagonal coupling",
    ". what would be far preferable would be attempts to compare theory and experiment directly , using the kind of computations discussed here - experiments would allow one to extract the renormalized parameters rather than the bare ones , and they will be quite different if the couplings are strong .",
    "it almost goes without saying , in view of the results found here , that any attempt to compare experiments with theories which do not include the effect of peierls couplings is likely to give very misleading results .",
    "a different avenue is opened by the use of cold atoms and/or polar molecules trapped in optical lattices as simulators of such mixed hamiltonians.@xcite as typical in such systems , they would permit the tuning of individual coupling strengths within wide ranges , such that properties like those discussed here could be investigated in a significant area of the parameter space .    to conclude , we have given a fairly exhaustive characterization of the behavior of polarons in the dual coupling h / ssh model , in terms of an effective band paradigm , in which diagonal interactions cause a continuous narrowing of a low - energy quasiparticle band , and non - diagonal interactions add non - local hopping terms to this band , which gradually change its shape , and eventually force the ground state to move , at a definite transition point , to non - zero momentum .",
    "indeed , we see no evidence for , nor any theoretical reason to expect , any sudden changes to the polaronic band , for any value of either diagonal or non - diagonal coupling to phonons .",
    "the effective band quasiparticle picture works if the phonon energy is larger than the renormalized bandwidth - otherwise level mixing between the phonons and the polaronic states gives a more complicated picture .",
    "the behavior of physical quantities in an h / ssh model will typically be rather different from what one expects from a simple holstein model , and this needs to be taken into account in comparison between theory and experiment .",

    "the other diagrams are then normalized by calculating the ratio between this normalization sector and the rest of the configuration space",
    ".    the accuracy of the normalization and of the data collected will depend closely on the histogram spacing used . a notable improvement over a simple histogram is to use a bin size increasing with @xmath291 , giving a better sampling at small times for an accurate normalization , while accumulating enough points per bin at large @xmath291 to average over statistical noise .",
    "when collecting statistics with variable - size bins , we need to include a factor of @xmath292 , with @xmath293 the size of the bin .",
