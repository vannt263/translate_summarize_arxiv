    "the past decade has witnessed a remarkable advance in our understanding of globular cluster ( gc ) systems .",
    "optical and ultraviolet imaging from _ hst _ has been used to study gc systems belonging to nearly one hundred ( mostly early type ) galaxies .",
    "spectra from 4 - 10 m class telescopes have yielded radial velocities for more than a thousand extragalactic gcs , along with metallicities for subset of the brighter objects .",
    "infrared photometry for extragalactic gcs is appearing in the literature at an ever - increasing rate , promising to refine our understanding of how these systems formed and evolved .",
    "indeed , theorists are now hard pressed to produce a single model for the formation of gc systems that explains  or , at least , is consistent with  the enormous amount of observational material that has been accumulated .",
    "this is a daunting task , since any viable formation model must reproduce and explain the apparently constant number of gcs per unit baryonic mass , the striking complexity of gc metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) , the observed spatial distributions of gcs about their host galaxy , and the emerging constraints on the ages and kinematics of the metal - poor ( mp ) and metal - rich ( mr ) gc subpopulations .",
    "what is ultimately required is a model that explains not just these observational properties , but also their variations ( if any ) with host galaxy environment and morphology .",
    "although several important issues remain unresolved , i will argue below that there may be an emerging consensus on the origin of the mp gc subpopulations associated with bright galaxies .",
    "the origin of the mr subpopulation remains very much open to debate .",
    "it is convenient to divide models for the formation of gc systems into three broad categories : pre- , proto- and post - galactic . while these divisions are useful for heuristic purposes , they should not be taken too literally since the classification is , in some cases , rather subjective .",
    "it is also worth noting that some models that have historically been considered quite distinct ( @xmath1 , ashman & zepf 1992 and ct @xmath2 1998 ) actually rely on similar mechanisms  mergers and accretions  to explain the formation of gc systems .",
    "these models differ mainly the assumed nature of the merger / accretion process : most notably in the assumed mass spectrum of the progenitors , the epoch of galaxy assembly , and the amount of dissipation and star / gc formation ( if any ) induced by the merger / accretion process .      in this picture",
    ", the formation of gcs predates that of their host galaxy .",
    "first suggested by dicke & peebles ( 1968 ) , who noted that the jeans mass at recombination was similar to the mean mass of galactic gcs , this model was later revised by peebles ( 1984 ) to explain gc formation in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated universe .",
    "we now recognize the gc mass distribution to have a roughly double power - law form with a break at @xmath3 , weakening the original jeans mass argument .",
    "recently , cen ( 2001 ) has proposed a variant of this model in which the mp gcs surrounding galaxies form during reionization , when the external radiation field produces inward shocks in low - mass , low - spin dark matter halos .",
    "such shocks , he argues , will compress the baryons and lead to the formation of gcs . while this model gives roughly the correct mass spectrum for gcs more massive than about @xmath4 ,",
    "the mechanism itself is quite unlike that observed in star- and cluster - forming molecular clouds in the local universe ( and leaves the formation of the mr gcs unexplained ) .",
    "moreover , it seems inevitable that this model should predict many intergalactic gcs in the local universe .",
    "although the properties of some gcs associated with a few galaxies like m87 are consistent with an intergalactic origin ( see ct @xmath2 2001 ) , there is still no case in which even a single gc can be said with certainty to be truly intergalactic in nature .",
    "it was suggested by harris & pudritz ( 1994 ) that gcs form within the dense cores of supergiant molecular clouds ( sgmcs ) : @xmath0 , an hypothesized population of pressure - confined , self - gravitating , isothermal , magnetized clouds .",
    "these sgmcs , they argued , were supported against gravitational collapse by magnetic field pressure and alfvnic turbulence .",
    "though most sgmcs would presumably have been disrupted during the assembly of the host galaxy , any surviving sgmcs would , if left in isolation , have masses of @xmath5 and diameters of @xmath6  kpc . in short",
    ", they would resemble dwarf galaxies .",
    "subsequent cosmological n - body / treesph simulations by weil & pudritz ( 2001 ) confirmed that gravitationally - bound objects having masses and sizes similar to these sgmcs do indeed form , and that they have a roughly power - law mass spectrum , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "since star and gc formation was not included in their simulations , no conclusion could be drawn regarding gc mdfs .",
    "an empirical method of studying gc mdfs has been has been explored in a series of papers by my collaborators and i ( ct @xmath2 1998 , 2000 , 2002 ) where a monte - carlo algorithm was developed to simulate the gc mdfs of galaxies that are assembled from  proto - galactic fragments \" . in this picture , both the total number of gcs and their metallicities are determined solely by the mass of the proto - galactic fragment in which they formed ; no gcs are formed during the merger and accretion process .",
    "the left panels of figure  1 show simulated and observed mdfs for nine of the 28 galaxies examined in ct @xmath2 ( 2002 ) .",
    "the right panel shows proto - galactic mass spectra for the 28 galaxies , along with the ensemble mass spectrum .",
    "these simulations suggest that the mass spectrum of proto - galactic fragments had an approximate power - law form with index @xmath9 , in close agreement with the n - body results .",
    "it is remarkable that two completely independent lines of evidence ( @xmath0 , n - body simulations of the gravitational collapse of primordial density fluctuations and monte - carlo simulations of the gc mdfs ) point to a steep proto - galactic mass spectrum .",
    "although this agreement lends credibility to the results , it is important to recall that the inferred mass spectrum is _ much _ steeper than measured luminosity function of galaxies in the local universe . thus , the formation of gc systems seems inevitably linked to the so - called  missing satellite \" problem ( klypin @xmath2 1999 ; moore @xmath2 1999 ) .    in a recent paper that further demonstrates the utility of gc systems in constraining cosmological models of galaxy formation ,",
    "beasley @xmath2 ( 2002 ) used the galform semi - analytic code to simulate the gc systems of 450 elliptical galaxies .",
    "the relative number of mp and mr gcs in their simulations  which include shock heating of the gas , radiative cooling , feedback , mergers and stellar evolution  were then compared to the observed numbers in m49 , where the census of gcs is very nearly complete .",
    "this comparison revealed that two _ ad hoc _ assumptions were necessary to reproduce the mp and mr gcs in the correct numbers .",
    "first , the formation efficiency of mr gcs must exceed that of mp gcs by a factor of @xmath10 3 - 4 ( see below for an examination of the plausibility of this assumption ) .",
    "second , the formation of mp gcs , which occur in low - mass halos that beasley @xmath2 term  proto - galactic disks \" , must be truncated abruptly at @xmath11 . without these assumptions ,",
    "the predicted population of mp gcs would dominate the mr population by up to two orders of magnitude at @xmath12 .",
    "unlike previous simulations , beasley @xmath2 were able to estimate _ ages _ for the gcs .",
    "the mp gcs have , by virtue of the assumed value of @xmath13 , a mean age of @xmath14 12 gyr .",
    "the mr gcs are then found to be 17 gyr younger , with a mean age difference of 3 gyr , although this too hinges on the assumed @xmath13 .",
    "building upon a suggestion by schweizer ( 1987 ) , ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) examined the possibility that a factor - of - two difference in specific frequency , @xmath15 , between normal elliptical and spiral galaxies ( @xmath1 , harris 1991 ) might be explained if : ( 1 ) normal elliptical galaxies formed as a result of major mergers of disk galaxies , and ( 2 ) the merger process led to the formation of new , presumably mr , gcs .",
    "there seems to be little doubt that a process of this sort has played in role in the formation of some elliptical galaxies , in light of the detection of young clusters forming in interacting galaxies ( @xmath1 , whitmore @xmath2 2001 ) .",
    "but is it plausible that major mergers of disk - galaxy pairs is the _ generic _ mechanism for the formation of normal elliptical galaxies , more than half of which show bimodal gc mdfs ( @xmath1 , larsen @xmath2 2001 ) ?    the most comprehensive study of gc formation in disk mergers is that of bekki @xmath2 ( 2002 ) , who used an n - body / treesph code to investigate mergers of pairs of gas - rich disk galaxies . these disks were _",
    "posited _ to contain a pre - existing population of exclusively mp gcs . using a simple pressure criterion for the onset of gc formation",
    ", bekki @xmath2 showed that the end - products of such mergers do indeed resemble elliptical galaxies , with distinct mp and mr gc subpopulations .",
    "the newly - formed mr gcs show a greater degree of concentration toward the center of the merger remnant , as is observed .",
    "bekki @xmath2 also examined the kinematic properties of the mp and mr gc subpopulations , finding the mp component to show a large velocity dispersion and a net rotation ; by contrast , the mr component was found to show a lower dispersion and modest rotation . by examining the gc mdfs of the merged galaxy , bekki @xmath2 also noted that the mean metallicity of the mr gcs far exceeded those measured for mr gcs in real ellipticals .",
    "as no plausible change in the assumed range of gas metallicities , abundance gradients in the progenitor disks , or gc formation criteria was able to alter this basic result , they concluded that ",
    "if most elliptical galaxies are formed by major mergers , then it must have occurred at high redshift \" .",
    "let us now consider how the various models fare in explaining the gc systems of real ellipticals .",
    "i will focus on a comparison of two thoroughly - studied ellipticals : m49 and m87 , the first- and second - ranked members of the virgo cluster , respectively .",
    "although they differ in @xmath16-band luminosity by only @xmath17 20% , the gc specific frequency of m87 exceeds that of m49 by a factor of 2 - 3 ( harris 1991 ) .",
    "together , these galaxies form a ",
    "second parameter \" pair in terms of their gc systems , and any viable formation scenario must account for the observed differences and similarities .    the primary motivation of the ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) merger model was an explanation of the higher specific frequencies of early - type galaxies relative to disk galaxies . in this picture ,",
    "mergers serve to increase specific frequency through the formation of mr gcs .",
    "thus , galaxies with high specific frequencies  of which m87 is the prototype  are expected to have predominantly mr gc systems according to this model . in the specific case of m87 ,",
    "this  excess \" population relative to m49 should amount to @xmath18 _ additional _ mr gcs .",
    "as figure  3 shows , this expectation is not borne out by the observations .",
    "the measured gc color distributions for the two galaxies ( based on deep hst imaging in identical filters from kundu @xmath2 1999 and kundu & whitmore 2001 ) are remarkably similar . parameterizing each distribution with a double - gaussian yields the percentages of mp and mr",
    "gcs given in table  1 .",
    "this table also give the total number of gcs belonging to each galaxy , @xmath19 , from mclaughlin ( 1999 ) , who showed that the observed difference in specific frequency between these two galaxies is likely due to the greater mass in x - ray emitting gas in the vicinity of m87 .",

    "global results for the two galaxies are presented in table  2 .",
    "a detailed discussion of the results is beyond the scope of this review , but the main findings can be summarized as follows . in m87 , both the mp and mr gc systems show significant rotation , with @xmath62 .",
    "the mr gcs rotate about the galaxy s minor axis everywhere , as do the mp gcs beyond @xmath63 kpc . inside this radius , however , the mp gcs appear to rotate about the _ major _ axis . in the case of m49 ,",
    "the mp gcs show modest minor axis rotation everywhere , with @xmath64 , while the mr gcs show little or no rotation .",
    "( the formal best - fit actually suggests that the mr gcs are counter - rotating ) .    clearly , the gc subsystems in m87 and m49 show some rather dramatic kinematic differences .",
    "this apparent complexity becomes is all the more puzzling when one considers that the two spiral galaxies have the best studied gc systems , the milky way and m31 , have @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the mp components , respectively . for their mr gc subpopulations ,",
    "rotation is even more important , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively ( ct 1999 ; perrett @xmath2 2002 ) .",
    "what implications do these results have for gc formation models ?",
    "first , the rotation observed for mp gcs in these galaxies suggests that , if these gcs did indeed originate in numerous , low - mass proto - galactic fragments as suggested by several of the  proto - galactic \" models discussed above , then these low - mass fragments must first have coalesced into larger entities before being incorporated into the final galaxy ( assuming that the observed rotation reflects the orbital angular momentum of the progenitor galaxies ) .",
    "secondly , the rapid rotation among the mr gcs in m87 ( and in the two spirals ) indicates that their formation in mergers may be unlikely , given that angular momentum transport should produce a slowly rotating population .",
    "on the other hand , the mr gcs in m49 are consistent with no net rotation , suggesting that angular momentum transport during a major merger may have been effective in this case .",
    "finally , i consider the critical issue of ages for the mp and mr gcs subpopulations in these galaxies , focusing on two complementary techniques that have been brought to bear upon this issue : integrated - light spectroscopy , and the magnitude difference between the turnovers of the gc luminosity functions ( lfs ) for the gc subpopulations .",
    "the former technique yields absolute ages for the gc subpopulations , while the latter approach gives only their relative ages .",
    "the various age measurements are summarized in table  3 , which reports @xmath69 for each gc subpopulation and , when available , the corresponding absolute ages . in the case of m87",
    ", the spectroscopy of cohen @xmath2 ( 1998 ) suggests an old age for both components , with no evidence for a trend between age and metallicity . on",
    "the other hand , kundu @xmath2 ( 1999 ) found a rather large age difference from the @xmath16 and @xmath70 luminosity functions , with the mr gcs being several gyr younger . a more recent application of this technique , however , which relies on strmgren photometry from from _ hst _ and makes use of the greater age sensitivity of the @xmath71-band , points to a very small age difference , in agreement with the spectroscopic results ( jordn @xmath2 2002 ) .",
    "for m49 , both techniques indicate that the gc subpopulations are coeval to within the measurement errors .",

    "the agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic results is generally encouraging .",
    "for these two galaxies at least , the mp and mr gcs seem to be truly old objects .",
    "although the error bars remain large , it seems that , if gc formation in mergers of any sort  minor or major  has played the dominant role in producing the mr gcs in these galaxies , then the merger / assembly process must have occurred at high redshift ( @xmath0 , @xmath78 in the currently fashionable @xmath79cdm models ) . in my opinion , these results suggest that the disparate metallicities of the gc subpopulations in these galaxies likely reflect _ environmental _ differences in the local sites of gc formation .",
    "in both m87 and m49 , the efficiency of gc formation is found to have the familiar  universal \" value of @xmath80% per unit baryon mass ( mclaughlin 1999 ) . in both galaxies ,",
    "the formation efficiencies of the separate mp and mr components is roughly half that of the gc system as a whole .",
    "these findings provide a challenge to models in which mr gcs form exclusively in major mergers , and to models that require different formation efficiencies for the mp and mr gcs .",
    "kinematic studies of the gc subpopulations in m87 and m49 reveal some interesting differences . in m87 ,",
    "both gc subpopulations show rapid rotation ; in m49 , the mp gcs show modest rotation , while the mr gcs form a non - rotating population .",
    "the existence of rapidly rotating gc subpopulations in these galaxies , and in the milky way and m31 , suggests that mergers have probably played a role in the formation of the host galaxies , as the amount of angular momentum involved seems to exceed that generated by tidal torques alone ( see ct @xmath2 2001 ) . with the exception of m49 ,",
    "the rapidly rotating mr gcs in these galaxies indicate that the formation of the mr gcs probably predated the mergers .",
    "furthermore , the ages of the gc subpopulations in m87 and m49 suggest that if the mergers were predominantly dissipational in nature , then the mergers must have occurred at high redshift , as noted by bekki @xmath2 ( 2002 ) from an analysis of simulated and observed gc mdfs .",
    "many properties of the mp gcs in m87 and m49 ( and in other galaxies ) are consistent with the predictions of models in which these gcs form in low - mass , proto - galactic fragments that are later accreted into the main body of the galaxy .",
    "these proto - galactic fragments appear to be the analogs of the low - mass subhalos that form in cosmological simulations of structure formation .",
    "indeed , the literature abounds with terminology for these objects : @xmath1 , proto - galactic fragments , supergiant molecular clouds , proto - galactic disks , searle - zinn fragments , failed dwarfs , @xmath81 . in terms of their physical properties",
    ", however , these are the same objects .",
    "while there may be an emerging consensus on the origin of the mp gcs , debate continues on the nature and origin of their mr counterparts .",
    "these clusters can be interpreted simply as those that formed in the most massive proto - galactic fragments , or as the endproducts of a star formation burst triggered by gas - rich mergers .",
    "the former interpretation has the sthetic advantage of requiring a single mechanism to explain both gc populations , while the second scenario has strong support from observations of young gcs forming in local mergers .",
    "it is likely that both processes have played a part in shaping the gc systems that we observe today , and our task for the decade ahead is to determine which , if either , of these processes has played a dominant role ."
