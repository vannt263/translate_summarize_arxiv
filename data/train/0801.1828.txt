    "over the past decade improvements in neutrino - transport and multi - dimensional computer simulations have lead to a new understanding of the conditions that lead to nucleosynthesis of the elements above iron in core - collapse supernovae . immediately following the bounce on the proto - neutron star ,",
    "the shock fully photodisintegrates the infalling material turning it into electron ",
    "position pairs , neutrons , and protons . as the nascent neutron star continues to collapse it",
    "liberates @xmath2 over the span of @xmath3 seconds primarily in the form of neutrinos .",
    "this enormous neutrino flux is deposited in the low density region of photodisintegrated matter inside the gain radius between the neutron star and the accretion shock of the still infalling material and heats it to temperatures in excess of 10 billion k while driving mass away in the form of a neutrino wind theoretically leading to the explosion of the supernova @xcite .",
    "the strong flux of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos results in a detailed balance between protons and neutrons that favors the lighter mass protons depending on the respective neutrino spectra leading to an electron fraction that is proton - rich ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "these protons and neutrons recombine into alpha particles that proceed via the @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7-reactions followed by a series of @xmath8-reactions or combined @xmath9-reactions along @xmath10 into the iron group , primarily @xmath11 and @xmath12 which form the seeds of the subsequent nucleosynthesis",
    ".    from this point the resulting nucleosynthesis in the neutrino - driven wind essentially depends on the number of seed nuclei to the number of excess neutrons or protons that were frozen out and did not turn into seed nucleii ( @xmath13 ) , the entropy per baryon , the expansion timescale of the ejecta and the amount of the ejecta .",
    "as the explosion evolves , an ejected mass element inherits some combination of these parameters and below @xmath14 they remain fairly constant as the matter proceeds to freeze out .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the early times when the wind still contains a proton excess because the rates for neutrino and positron captures on neutrons are faster than those for the inverse captures on protons .",
    "we consider two interesting problems which are discussed in the following two sections .",
    "the origin of @xmath0mo is a long standing puzzle of nucleosynthesis ( for reviews , see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is thought to originate in the proton - rich wind prior to the @xmath16-process in core collapse supernovae , but historically it has been underproduced in such models or subject to severe model constraints @xcite .",
    "recent supernova models show that the @xmath17 of the innermost ejecta is greater that the @xmath13 of the most abundant @xmath18-nuclei @xcite .",
    "this implies the existence of surplus protons which allow the production of proton - rich @xmath18-nuclei nuclei by the @xmath19-process @xcite .",
    "however , similar to the @xmath20-process in the x - ray burst scenario , there is an important waiting point at @xmath21 which backs up material beyond the @xmath22 dynamic timescale of the innermost ejecta in core collapse @xcite .    to solve this problem ,",
    "it was suggested a new @xmath23-process in which neutrinos convert some of the surplus protons into neutrons allowing the waiting points to be bridged via an @xmath24-reaction @xcite .",
    "this accelerates the flow into heavier elements and creates the light @xmath18-nuclei which are otherwise missing from the standard @xmath16-process .",
    "these calculations were independently confirmed by calculations based on simulations @xcite .    still ,",
    "relative to the solar abundances , both calculations show underproduction of @xmath15 ( the most abundant of the @xmath18-nuclei ) relative to the @xmath18-nuclei of ru and pd .",
    "there are three possible reasons why @xmath15 is not co - produced with the other @xmath18-nuclei : 1 ) the @xmath23-process is active , but @xmath15 is primarily synthesized at other sites .",
    "2 ) the @xmath23-process is not active , so another explanation is needed .",
    "3 ) the @xmath23-process is active , but the nuclear parameters that enter the nucleosynthesis calculation are incorrect . in this paper , we investigate the third possibility .",
    "nucleosynthesis results obtain from the sum total of the reaction flow in all the matter trajectories of the supernova ejecta . here",
    "we only consider the reaction flow in `` trajectory 6 '' ( see table 2 of @xcite ) based on the model of @xcite ( see @xcite for specific code details and @xcite for more details ) . `` trajectory 6 '' is the trajectory where neutrino interactions are the most important in making the @xmath18-nuclei between sr and pd .",
    "the @xmath23-process starts on the iron group but it is halted at the long - lived @xmath21 waiting point which is known to be bridged by an ( n , p)-reaction allowing the @xmath23-process to continue @xcite .",
    "the flow from @xmath21 passes through all even - even @xmath25 isotopes until @xmath26 is reached @xcite . as fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] shows , the pattern is broken because of the low proton separation energy of @xmath27 that prevents immediate proton captures up to @xmath28 .",
    "instead the flow proceeds via @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "a @xmath32-reaction would result in the @xmath33 progenitor provided it does not get destroyed by another @xmath32-reaction .",
    "alternatively , an @xmath24-reaction to @xmath34 followed by a @xmath32-reaction would result in the @xmath35 progenitor once again provided it does not get destroyed by another @xmath32-reaction . in both cases",
    "the reverse reactions from @xmath36 and @xmath37 would increase the survival of the @xmath38 progenitors .",
    "many of the relevant reaction rates , spins , partition functions , and proton separation are not known experimentally and the theoretical values are subject to considerable uncertainties which may change the flow .",
    "for instance , a 50% yield increase in @xmath15 was found after a plausible @xmath39 increase in the proton separation energy of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we systematically investigated the effect relevant nuclear uncertainties on this reaction flow using the model described in @xcite .",
    "we find that variation within current uncertainties @xcite of the @xmath40rh proton separation energy and the @xmath0rh proton separation energy does not change the solar abundance ratio of @xmath0mo to@xmath1mo whereas the ratio is highly sensitive to the proton separation energy of @xmath41rh .",
    "[ enfig ] shows the dependence of the solar ratio @xmath0mo to @xmath1mo to variations in entropy of `` trajectory 6 '' .",
    "we show that @xmath42 mev is a solution to a range of entropy variations between 0.8 and 1.6 of the nominal value .",
    "the figure also shows no solution above @xmath43 mev .     as a function of changes in entropy ,",
    "@xmath44 relative to the entropy of `` trajectory 6 '' , @xmath45 , in the outflowing wind for the solar ratio of @xmath46.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    fig .",
    "[ yefig ] shows the dependence of the solar ratio @xmath0mo to@xmath1mo to variations in entropy in `` trajectory 6 '' as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath47 .",
    "the figure also shows the solutions where @xmath0mo and @xmath1mo are co - produced within a factor 4,5 and 7 .",
    "isotopes produced with precisely the solar abundance pattern have equal production factors .",
    "a co - production factor of no more than 7 is typically regarded as acceptable as the global characteristics of nucleosynthesis are sensitive to details of the outflow .     and @xmath48 where the @xmath46 ratio in the outgoing wind matches the solar ratio .",
    "error bars indicate the extent of similar lines for ratios of 1.54 and 1.59 . also shown",
    "are the solutions where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are coproduced within a factor 4 , 5 , and 7 .",
    "a solution is found for a co - production factor of 5 with @xmath13=0.555 and @xmath48 = 1.72 ( see main text for details ) .",
    "[ yefig],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the conclusion that the @xmath0mo and @xmath1mo ratio is predominantly influenced by @xmath47 has been shown to be robust ( fisker et al .",
    ", submitted for publication ) . however , our calculations predict that @xmath42 mev whereas recent experimental results suggest that @xmath51 mev @xcite .",
    "this leads to the tentative conclusion that proton rich winds under the conditions in the model investigated here can not be the sole source of the solar @xmath0mo and @xmath1mo .",
    "using the same supernova model as above , the contribution to core - collapse nucleosyntheis of the proton - rich bubbles and proton - rich winds was investigated in @xcite however , some bubbles also contains neutron - rich matter that is ejected in coincidence with the proton - rich bubbles . here ,",

    "the flow from these nuclei leads to @xmath54ge . unlike the @xmath23-process @xcite ,",
    "there is not a sufficient amount of protons left at this time for neutrinos provide sufficient numbers of neutrons to capture on @xmath54ge and thus move beyond this waiting point . as a result ,",
    "heavier isotopes are not co - produced with the @xmath55ni and @xmath56zn isotopes . in particular , there is no overproduction of the light p - nuclei for @xmath57 . for @xmath13",
    "closer to 0.47 , primarily @xmath58ni are formed .",
    "this means that the @xmath56ge waiting point is circumvented which leads to overproduction of @xmath59se , @xmath60kr , and @xmath61mo which is co - produced with @xmath56zn .",
    "with decreasing @xmath13 , @xmath61mo production falls off and the overproduction of n=50 nuclei ensues .",
    "the figure shows the integrated production factors for all studied neutron - rich bubble trajectories .",
    "the most produced isotopes in the neutron - rich parts of the bubble relative to solar abundances are @xmath55ni and @xmath56zn which originate in bubbles with ye closer to 0.5 .",
    "these are co - produced along with @xmath59se and @xmath60kr which originate in the bubbles with ye closer to 0.47 .",
    "the neutron - rich bubbles add @xmath59se , @xmath60kr , and @xmath61mo to the bubble - outflow , but this contribution is much smaller than the contribution from the proton - rich winds when neutrino interactions are included .",
    "the neutron - rich bubbles also add @xmath55ni and @xmath56zn to the total outflow but only in comparable amounts to the wind outflows and the proton - rich bubble outflows .",
    "our results show that the overproduction factors of the neutron - rich bubbles folded with the mass - ejecta does not contribute significantly to the nucleosynthesis of the light p - nuceli compared to the nucleosynthesis of the proton - rich material .",
