    "three - flavor baryon chiral perturbation theory ( bchpt ) @xcite is an effective field theory for qcd in the low - energy regime where the lowest - lying meson - octet and the lowest - lying baryon octet ( and possibly also the decuplet ) are the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "it is now known for many years that chiral expansions derived from this framework are usually not under sufficient theoretical control because of an unsatisfying convergence behavior : higher - order corrections from chiral loops can in general not be guaranteed to be much smaller than the leading terms .",
    "the quark mass expansion around the three - flavor chiral limit converges slowly because the strange quark mass , @xmath0 , is much larger than the light quark masses @xmath1 , and induces sizeable kaon loop corrections to the leading tree level results .",
    "detailed discussions on the convergence behavior of bchpt from various perspectives can be found in @xcite .",
    "the essential point , however , can be seen immediately from a comparison of mass scales : while @xmath2 is small compared to a typical hadronic scale of @xmath3 , the three - flavor expansions can involve @xmath4 , which is not small compared to that reference scale . in fact , loop graphs involving the eta meson are only suppressed by an additional factor of @xmath5 , which can easily be compensated by additional prefactors ( @xmath6 is the meson decay constant in the three - flavor chiral limit , while @xmath7 is related to the quark condensate in the same limit ) .",
    "the problem is particularly urgent for chiral extrapolation formulae for lattice simulations .",
    "there , the meson masses are in general even larger than for physical quark masses . consequently , the application of bchpt to such lattice data is not under satisfactory theoretical control . though one can obtain",
    "fits that seem to describe the data fairly well , a stable determination of the corresponding low - energy constants ( lecs ) is not yet within reach , because the extracted values can be strongly affected by uncontrolled higher - order corrections . for some specific application",
    ", one might not even worry much about this , but one should recall that the main point of chpt is to yield relations between many different observables , in terms of a limited set ( at least at a fixed order in the low - energy expansion ) of parameters .",
    "for example , the baryon mass in the chiral limit , @xmath8 , and its leading quark mass corrections will unavoidably appear in practically _ any _ complete loop calculation in bchpt , in baryon form factors , meson - baryon scattering lengths , etc .",
    "therefore , one should try to somehow control the higher - order loop corrections .",
    "many alternative ways to overcome this problem have been proposed in the literature , e.g. long - distance regularization @xcite , reordering and resummation schemes @xcite , large-@xmath9-scaling arguments @xcite and two - flavor expansions for hyperon properties @xcite , each having its own merits . in this work ,",
    "we stick to a standard scheme ( evaluating the chiral loops employing infrared regularization @xcite ) and thus analyze the quark mass expansions of the baryon octet masses in a fashion closely following @xcite .",
    "we refer to that reference for most of the corresponding technical details ( see also @xcite ) . for studies in different schemes ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we have reproduced the complete one - loop ( @xmath10 ) calculation in this covariant scheme .",
    "our aim here is to put to use calculations like @xcite , by analyzing the lattice data presented in @xcite which covers a quark mass region where all the masses of the pseudoscalar bosons are _ smaller _ than the physical eta mass , and to give improved estimates for lecs featuring in these calculations .",
    "we consider this a first and necessary step toward a controlled application of bchpt to such data sets . while in most three - flavor lattice simulations , the ( large )",
    "strange quark mass is fixed larger than the physical value , resulting in large kaon and eta masses , which makes the application of three - flavor chiral extrapolations even more problematic . ] , and the physical point is approached lowering @xmath11 ( see e.g. @xcite for recent examples ) , the strategy in @xcite is different : one simulates at a `` symmetric point '' where @xmath12 , and then approaches the physical point increasing the quark mass difference , but keeping the average quark mass fixed . at the symmetric point , the pseudoscalar octet mesons all have the same mass of about @xmath13 , and on the trajectory to the physical point , the kaons and etas are lighter than observed in nature ( there even exist some data points where the meson masses are all @xmath14 at @xmath15 ) .",
    "this is already a nice feature , but there is a second point that is probably even more important . in a surprisingly large region around the symmetric point ,",
    "approximations neglecting all but linear symmetry - breaking effects were shown in @xcite to yield a very good description of the data .",
    "in particular , quantities which do not receive linear symmetry - breaking contributions are observed to be very stable even down to the physical point ( one example for such a quantity is the famous gell - mann - okubo mass difference ) .",
    "this behavior can not be understood from chpt alone , but it puts tight constraints on certain combinations of lecs ( e.g. by enforcing large cancellations in higher - order terms in the @xmath16-expansion of such quantities ) .",
    "it is convenient for the purpose of studying the symmetry - breaking effects separately to analyze certain baryon mass _ ratios _ , where a large factor with the dimension of mass ( essentially the baryon mass at the symmetric point ) cancels out .",
    "the behavior of these ratios can be very well described by bchpt ( see our fig .",
    "[ fig : fanplot3sets ] , and also @xcite for a corresponding illustration ) . here",
    "we want to exploit the advantages just mentioned for the determination of the lec - combinations occurring in octet baryon masses , in the hope that this will help e.g. when analyzing lattice data for other quantities with the same strategy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after briefly introducing some basic notation in sec .  [",
    "sec : vorspiel ] , we collect the input from the purely mesonic sector in sec .",
    "[ sec : mesons ] in some detail .",
    "this is necessary , because the quark - mass dependence of the masses of the pseudoscalar mesons is needed to rewrite the quark mass expansions of the baryon masses at @xmath10 in terms of the meson masses .",
    "we also include some simple examples of our strategy of analysis in this section . in sec .",
    "[ sec : q3 ] , we consider the result of the leading one - loop ( @xmath17 ) calculation , to set the stage for the later developments .",
    "we also show some examples of a first numerical analysis , analyzing the experimental baryon masses . sec .",
    "[ sec : q4 ] completes the outline of our framework specifying the lagrangians and diagrams entering at fourth chiral order .",
    "readers who are only interested in the results for the baryon sector are invited to skip secs .",
    "[ sec : mesons]-[sec : q4 ] and directly continue with sec .",
    "[ sec : analyse ] , in which we discuss in detail the extrapolation functions we use , and which combinations of lecs can be extracted more accurately than before from the data we consider ( and which can not ) . in a series of tables , we present our fit results , obtained with different fit strategies and input parameter sets .",
    "we discuss our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : diskussion ] and give a short conclusion of our findings .",
    "throughout we work in the isospin limit and set the @xmath18ight quark masses to @xmath19 . in @xcite ,",
    "the quark masses are varied along a trajectory @xmath20 in the @xmath21-space where the average quark mass @xmath22 is kept fixed , while @xmath23 is varied . the aforesaid trajectory",
    "@xmath20 connects the symmetric point , where @xmath24 , and the physical point where the strange quark mass attains its physical value while @xmath25 .",
    "+ to get familiar with the notation , let us consider the leading terms in the quark - mass expansion of the squares of the pseudo - goldstone - boson masses .",
    "we have @xmath26 here @xmath7 is related to the quark condensate in the chiral limit , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the leading term of the pseudo - goldstone - boson mass at the symmetric point is then found by setting @xmath27 , @xmath28 our notation is set up such that quantities in the chiral limit will be denoted by a subscript @xmath29 , while quantities at the symmetric point on @xmath20 are marked with a @xmath30 .",
    "+ in @xcite , it was noted that some specific combinations of hadron masses are very stable when varying the quark masses along @xmath20 , compare e.g. tab .  2 and fig",
    ".  13 in that paper .",
    "below , we list three of these combinations which are relevant for our present study : @xmath31 the experimental values are given in round brackets .",
    "the one - loop expressions for the masses of the pions , kaons and the eta can be found e.g. in @xcite . we give here the expansions of these formulae in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath16 .",
    "the meson mass squared at the symmetric point is given ( to one - loop accuracy ) by @xmath33 the expansion of the meson masses in the symmetry - breaking parameter @xmath16 reads @xmath34 consequently , we have for the combinations @xmath35 : @xmath36 the low - energy constants @xmath37 of course correspond to the renormalized constants @xmath38 of @xcite . in @xcite , instead of the quark mass difference @xmath39 , the variable @xmath40 is used to parameterize the su(3 ) symmetry breaking . inverting this relation and again expanding up to the second order in the symmetry - breaking variable @xmath16 , we get @xmath41 where we have also truncated the chiral expansion of the coefficient functions in this series .      similarly , the expansion of the decay constants is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 note that if terms nonlinear in the symmetry - breaking variable are neglected , the combination @xmath44 is stable at that order .      for the sake of completeness , we also give an expression for the quantity @xmath45 in terms of the one - loop formulae for the meson masses : @xmath46 keeping this quantity fixed , one can express the light quark mass dependence of the baryon masses through the pion mass dependence , using @xmath47      for an overview on lattice determinations of the parameters @xmath48 we refer to the recent discussion in @xcite .",
    "we reproduce three sets of results in the table below . as central values in our numerical analysis",
    ", we adopt the set of parameters displayed in the first row ( milc2010 ) .",
    "the other three parameter sets are used only for the error estimates of our results .",
    "the numerical values of the @xmath37 are given at a renormalization scale of @xmath49 .",
    ".three parameter sets for the low - energy coefficients @xmath48 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     going on to the other lecs , and forming the combinations determined here with the results given in table 6 ( fit i ) of @xcite , we note that they are all consistent with the ranges we gave above , at least within the errors given there , with one exception , which is given by @xmath50 ( we have checked that the shift from @xmath51 used in the latter reference to the value @xmath52 used here does not induce large effects on our ranges ) .",
    "however , one should note that the parameter @xmath53 in @xcite jumps from a small value @xmath54 at @xmath55 and @xmath17 ( consistent with our bounds on @xmath50 ) to a comparatively large value @xmath56 in the @xmath10 fits .",
    "we suppose that this parameter is particularly afflicted by convergence problems , given that a large part of the data set analysed in @xcite are at the border , or even outside , of the region where the three - flavor expansions work in a reliable manner .      rewriting our formula for the contact term contribution to the sigma term , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigpincont2 ] ) , in terms of our fitting parameters defined in eqs.([eq : deflinpar],[eq : b0prime ] ) , we find @xmath57 this shows that we can write the sigma term resulting from our formulae as @xmath58 where the first term is written in terms of our fitting parameters .",
    "the unknown constants @xmath59 parameterize the dependence on @xmath32 of the terms linear in @xmath16 .",
    "the latter dependence starts as soon as one includes chiral loops , i.e. at @xmath17 , see e.g. eq .  ( [ eq : feins ] ) .",
    "let us consider two examples to estimate the unknown parameter combination in question , ignoring the issue of convergence for the moment .",
    "for the fit of table  [ tab : res ] with set 1 , the first term is @xmath60 , while for the fit with set 4 , it results in @xmath61 . for the remainder , we can only give a very rough estimate based on a consistency condition : requiring that the terms @xmath62 do not yield more than a @xmath63 correction in the combinations @xmath64 gives bounds @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xmath67 , which produces sigma terms between @xmath68 for set 1 and @xmath69 for set 4 .",
    "these bounds are consistent with recent three - flavor lattice determinations , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we also mention that the above consistency bounds for @xmath70 are obeyed by the results for these two parameters given in @xcite",
    ".    however , it is to be noted that we do not see a clear sign of convergence for the sigma term at physical quark masses , so one should not overinterprete these last results . basically we have to conclude that the sigma term could only be reliably determined from bchpt extrapolations when more data also for smaller average quark masses ( so that e.g. @xmath71 ) become available .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed lattice data for octet baryon masses from @xcite employing manifestly covariant bchpt with three dynamical flavors . we were able to give bounds on the numerical values of certain combinations of low - energy constants ( lecs ) , which are , in our opinion , more reliable and accurate than it was possible before data for fixed average quark mass became available in @xcite : as we have seen , the simulation strategy used in that work offers some advantages for this purpose .",
    "( [ eq : bdtillin],[eq : bftillin ] ) , ( [ eq : m0fin],[eq : b0pfin],[eq : d6tilfin ] ) and ( [ eq : d1tilfin],[eq : d2fin],[eq : d4tilfin],[eq : d7tilfin ] ) should be considered as our main results .",
    "we hope that these bounds will be useful in the near future , e.g. when studying the chiral behavior of other hadron observables with the same simulation strategy . though we have fixed the running of the baryon masses on the two trajectories @xmath72 and @xmath73 , there are still two undetermined parameters , chosen here as @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which would have to be fixed in order to make an @xmath10 prediction for the sigma term",
    "however , even if those parameters were fixed accurately , the uncertainty in the determination of the sigma term would still be very large due to the very slow convergence near the physical point .",
    "for an investigation of sigma terms , a two - flavor version of chpt is certainly superior ; we refer to @xcite for a recent determination . in closing , we stress again that additional data points for lower average quark masses would be very helpful in order to reach a truly controlled chiral extrapolation .",
