    "since the precursive study of d.j.watts and h.e .",
    "strogatz on small - world network ( swn)@xcite , there have been enormous research activities concerning the critical properties of some spin - lattice models built on them[2 - 13 ] . among the various model systems ,",
    "the guassian model@xcite is always chosen as a special one to give detailed investigation on some important problems because of its relative simplicity in mathematics . in the previous studies , due to the complexity of the problem itself and the often formidable mathematical task , two spins connected by a long - range bond",
    "are usually supposed to act in the same way as those connected by a regular one .",
    "in other words , their interaction contributes to the system hamiltonian to the same extent and they obey the redistribution mechanism . in short , there is no difference between a long - range bond and a regular one .",
    "however , one may be curious about the extent to which the features of phase transition will be different if one chooses certain physical quantities such as @xmath0 in the guassian model to be different . also prompted by the recent studies of the critical properties of the system under long - range interactions@xcite , it seems quite reasonable and meaningful to make such an attempt on the swn , which is always looked as the model systems for the networks in reality .",
    "the present study is thus aimed to make an investigation on the new features of the critical temperature of the guassian model built on swns caused by the distance dependent power - law decaying long - range interaction @xmath1 .",
    "it is reported in such a stepwise sequence : sec.ii presents our definition of the spin - lattice guassian model on swns and the certification of its feasibility to be categorized into the two main groups of swns being studied .",
    "the succeeding one embodies the thematic study of how the critical temperature is affected by the long - range interactions .",
    "sec.iv gives the summarization with some discussions .",
    "following the first prototype of small - world network and a number of other variants@xcite .",
    "we define the spin - lattice guassian model built on swns in such a little different way : starting with an initial @xmath2dimensional network of @xmath3 spins with periodic boundary condition , each spin is linked to its @xmath4 nearest neighbors ( we choose @xmath5 in this paper )",
    ". then ( 1 ) without changing the original bonds , but with probability @xmath6 , each pair of non - nearest neighboring spins is additionally connected by a `` shortcut''(as a model system for networks in reality , we suppose the number of shortcut to be much smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "practically we require @xmath7 ) ; ( 2 ) the spins are visited one after another , and each bond connecting a spin to one of its @xmath8 nearest neighbors is reconnected with probability @xmath9 to another randomly chosen one . in the sequel , by comparing some of the results we got with those got in other studies , we will show how the modelling systems defined above can be categorized into the typical two main groups of swns .",
    "let us begin with the classical guassian effective hamiltonian    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the reduced distance dependent interaction between a spin pair .",
    "the spins can take any real value between @xmath12 , and the probability of finding a given spin between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is assumed to be the guassian - type distribution @xmath15 d\\sigma_{m}$ ] .",
    "@xmath16 is the guassian distribution constant .",
    "@xmath17 the boltzman constant and @xmath18 the thermodynamic temperature .    generally the critical point of a guassian system",
    "is determined by the singularity of the free energy    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a constant . however , since @xmath21 here must not take any value greater than @xmath16 , one can always obtain the critical point by    @xmath22    here @xmath23 is the fourier transform of @xmath24    @xmath25    supposing firstly there is no difference between along - range bond and a regular one , that is , @xmath21 is a constant @xmath26 independent of @xmath27 , eq.(4 ) then becomes    @xmath28    for the one - dimensional guassian chain constructed by the shortcut - adding operation introduced at the beginning of this section , one can easily find @xmath29 .",
    "where @xmath30 is the minimum number of the intervals between any two spins .",
    "see fig.1 ( a ) for an example , the value of corresponding to the two nodes @xmath31 and @xmath32 is defined as 3 , and that between nodes @xmath32 and @xmath20 is 2 .",
    "thus @xmath30 can take any integral value between @xmath33 $ ] . where @xmath34 correspond to the case of no `` shortcut ''",
    "has been added into the network .",
    "@xmath35 is the lattice constant .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    now eq.(5 ) can be expressed as    @xmath36    setting @xmath37 , @xmath21 then reaches its maximum @xmath38 by similar analysis this result can be extended to systems with higher dimensionality as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the spatial dimension .",
    "then the general expression of the critical point is obtained to be @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the value of @xmath26 when the system reach its critical point .    in order to determine the critical point of the guassian system constructed by the second kind of operation",
    ", we should take into account two important factors .",
    "firstly , the bond - rewiring operation havent altered the total number of bonds in the network but it will change the coordination number of some certain nodes . secondly , the rewiring operation makes the structure of the network rather irregular . for a convenience aim , we suppose the bonds rewired are reconnected to the modes distributing symmetrically around a reference one @xmath43 . at the same time , notice that the coordination number of the lattice is still 2 on average although the neighbors of some nodes can be greater or smaller than it . in this mean - field view",
    ", we get    @xmath44    where @xmath30 ranges from 2 to @xmath45 . thus we obtain the critical point : @xmath46 , and in case of higher dimensionality    @xmath47    seen from eqs.(9 ) and ( 11 ) , the critical point of the guassian sytem built on the two kinds of networks we defined inclines to the same values as those got in earlier studies@xcite .",
    "therefore , we can undoubtedly categorize the networks we defined to the two main groups of swns - the adding - type swn @xciteand the rewiring - type swn@xcite respectively .",
    "the distance dependent power - law decaying long - range interaction ubiquitously exists in reality and is relatively easy to treat , so with an aim to give the study rather qualitatively than quantificationally , the choose of such a form of interaction is naturally . from the point of view of theoretical physics",
    ", this means to set    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the decaying rate constant .",
    "now let s go on to see how and to what extent the long - range interactions affect the critical temperature of the system .",
    "firstly , we will aim at the one - dimensional guassian model built on the adding - type swn . in accordance with eq.(12 ) , @xmath24 can take two separate forms of values .",
    "one is @xmath50 , which represents the interactions originally exist between the nearest - neighboring spin pair .",
    "the other is @xmath51 representing the interaction between two spins connected by a long - range bond , where @xmath52 $ ] , and the distance between two spins is supposed to be proportional to the lattice constant @xmath35 . not to forget here",
    "that , the long - range bond was added in with the probability of @xmath6 .",
    "so after fourier transform @xmath24 we get @xmath53 and its maximum @xmath54    then the criticalpoint of the system can be determined easily through eq.(3 ) . for analytical convenience ,",
    "we show in fig.(2 ) the @xmath55 and @xmath6 dependence of @xmath42 for a certain network with @xmath3 spins .",
    "seen from it @xmath42 increases sharply with @xmath55 , approaching quickly to the stable value @xmath46 , which corresponds to the result of only considering nearest - neighboring interactions .",
    "this means the affection of the long - range interaction on the critical temperature is most apparent at very small values of @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath55 take a large value , the long - range interaction will quickly attenuate and show hardly any influence on the critical temperature .    in the succession ,",
    "let s treat the one - dimensional guassian model on the rewiring - type swn . by a similar analysis",
    ", one can easily find @xmath24 also takes two forms of values here .",
    "they are : @xmath50 with the probability of @xmath56 ; and @xmath51 with the probability of @xmath9 . and the value of @xmath30 still range from 2 to @xmath45 .",
    "thus we can express @xmath21 as    @xmath57    and its maximum    @xmath58    the @xmath55 and @xmath9 dependence of @xmath42 can be got from eqs.(3 ) and ( 16 ) without difficulty , shown in fig.(3 ) .",
    "notice that there is an interesting feature of the curves : they form an intersection at @xmath59 , which means @xmath46 for arbitrary values of @xmath9 . in a physical view , the bond - rewiring operation have no affection on the critical temperature .",
    "this is in accordance with the results reported in earlier studies .",
    "but it does not always make sense . if we take @xmath60 the critical temperature decreases ( increases ) respectively , and when @xmath61 it tends to be a @xmath9 dependent constant .",
    "this shows that practically the critical temperature of the guassian system on the rewiring - type swns will be altered by the long - range interactions",
    ". it may be a result of the totally different role played by the long - range bonds .     and @xmath6 dependence of @xmath62 on the adding - type swns , taking into account the affect of long rang interactions . where @xmath63 . ]     and @xmath9 dependence of @xmath62 on the rewiring - type swns , taking into account the affect of long rang interactions . where @xmath63",
    "in this paper , we made an attempt to study the critical temperature of the spin - lattice guassian model built on the two groups of typical small - world networks affected by the power - law decaying long - range interaction .",
    "the results we got qualitatively show the new features of the critical temperature caused by the long - range interactions : on the adding - type swn , the present of the long - range bonds increased the contact of a spin with the system , assisted the system to behave as a whole , and thus increased the critical temperature of the system to some extent . while on the rewiring - type swn , the long - range interactions partly replaced the nearest - neighbor coupling , the change of the critical temperature then mostly depends on the competition of such two kinds of interactions .",
    "anyone s superiority will lead to the increase or decrease of the critical temperature . if they contribute to the system s hamiltonian equally in extent , the critical point will remain as the classical result @xmath46 .",
    "we have to admit that the present study is not strictly accurate in calculating the critical temperature , but it indeed satisfied the intention to give a qualitatively analysis on it .",
    "we hope that further studies on the critical properties of spin - lattice models built on swns will continue to reveal interesting topics of the widely existing critical phenomena combined with the small - world networks .",
