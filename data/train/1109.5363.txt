    "the direct driven inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) process can be divided into four stages , i.e. , the laser radiation , the implosion - compression , the fusion ignition and the deuterium - tritium ( dt ) fuel burn .",
    "mainly , in the second stage , the hydrodynamical interfacial fluid instabilities can act .",
    "the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability can occur during the two phases of the ablative acceleration and the compression deceleration of the icf implosion .",
    "in addition to rt instability , rm instability can occur when shocks pass through the irregular fluid interface .",
    "the nonspherical implosion in icf process generates the shear flow causing the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability . *",
    "the growth of these instability can be affected by the density ratio of two fluids , geometry of the interface , compressibility effects , heat conduction and mass flow at the interface*. these instabilities should be mitigated for efficient compression in icf experiment .",
    "mikaelian and lindl@xmath0 explained that the smooth density gradient at the interface stabilize the hydrodynamic instability in icf situation .",
    "however , they considered a constant and exponential density gradient at the interface .",
    "initially this work started by plesset @xmath1 for stability condition of underwater explosion considering the velocity along the radial direction only .",
    "he discussed the stability and instability conditions depending on the pressure difference at the interface of bubble .",
    "growth of perturbed interface due to density @xmath2 variation has been discussed in different geometry @xmath3 .",
    "rt growth stabilization effect has been showed very well by hot spot dynamics @xmath4 in ablation situation of icf . however , ramshaw @xmath5 extended mikaelians@xmath6 work using lagrangian formulation in hydrodynamical model in a spherical geometry . in this context ,",
    "several authors @xmath7 pointed out that during implosion(acceleration phase ) the fluid is compressed hence the fluid density increases rapidly inside the sphere .",
    "similarly , during the blow off(deceleration phase ) the fluid is relaxed to expand and fluid density falls exponentially from the perturbation surface . during robustness",
    "compression @xmath8 of direct driven icf target , the density can be compressed by 100 to 200 times of liquid dt density at cryogenic temperature @xmath9 .",
    "perturbation amplitudes and its growth rates of hydrodynamical instabilities of laser fusion targets has been studied in acceleration and deceleration phase including the heat conduction effect @xmath10using lagrangian formulation .",
    "numerical , simulation and experimental results@xmath11 of rmi are performed in cylindrical geometry considering implosion and explosion situation . however , the growth of rm instability can be suppressed due to different shape of the interface @xmath12 .",
    "recently , x - ray and proton radiography technique has been used to study the fast ignition implosion in cylindrical geometry @xmath13 .",
    "the simulation result well agree with the experimental result .",
    "so , density variation and sphericity are two key factor to understand clearly for successful of icf process .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the nonlinear evolution of perturbed interface in spherical geometry considering mean interface @xmath14 $ ] and angular amplitude both are dynamical variables . as a result , the growth and growth rate of nonspherical interface due to implosion has been changed for both variable with time . hence , the nonspherical irregular interface changes explicitly with radius , polar angle and time .",
    "analytically and numerically we have shown the density variation for compression - blow off situation of icf .",
    "theoretically high compression may be achieved depending on the density variation at the interface of two fluids .",
    "polar plot also shows the time evolution of the interface in spherical geometry .",
    "growth reduction has been shown for high value of mode number for a particular initial conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 , deals with basic assumptions and equation of continuity .",
    "expressions of kinetic energy of two fluids followed by lagrangian equation of motion have been discussed in section 3 .",
    "the nonlinear equations which describe the growth and the growth rate of perturbed interface are presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 contains results and discussions .",
    "finally , we conclude the results with a hope of future study on this work .",
    "we have considered two concentric spherical shells having two incompressible , immiscible and inviscid fluids of density @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the unperturbed interface at any time is given by @xmath17 .",
    "the lighter fluid is bounded in the inner shell at @xmath18 and the heavier fluid is ceiling at radius @xmath19 , where , @xmath20 , as shown in fig.1 . here",
    "we assume that the interface is perturbed to @xmath21 which is given by @xmath22+\\sqrt{\\frac{2l+1}{2}}a_l(t)p_l(cos\\theta)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are mean radius of perturbed interface , angular displacement and legendre polynomial of mode number @xmath25 respectively and @xmath26 $ ] . here",
    "we ignore the azimuthal dependence of perturbed interface due to spherical symmetry .",
    "however , simulation @xmath27 study shows that there is a weak dependence of growth rate on azimuthal angle .",
    "now we assume that the fluid motion is irrotational in the interface region , i.e . , its obey laplace s equation @xmath28 .",
    "so the velocity potentials for lighter and heavier fluids are @xmath29 @xmath30 respectively .    due to shock impingement",
    ", the nonspherical perturbed interface leads to the density variation as follows @xmath31 @xmath32 for lighter and heavier fluid , respectively .",
