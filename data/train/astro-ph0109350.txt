    "the possibility that a large increase in the speed of light in the early universe can solve the initial value problems in cosmology  @xcite , and present an alternative to the standard inflationary models  @xcite , has received mounting attention  @xcite .",
    "higher - dimensional models lead to a varying speed of light ( vsl ) when the radion field in e.g. five - dimensional models varies  @xcite .",
    "the recent increasing evidence for a cosmological evolution of the fine structure constant in a red shift range @xmath1 is therefore of considerable interest  @xcite .",
    "the idea that the fine structure constant is varying over the history of the universe has a long history  @xcite , and if this discovery is confirmed by further observations and analyses , then it will have a profound impact on the future of physics",
    ". models of varying @xmath2 have been proposed recently  @xcite and a study has been made of the possibility that the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data could be used to detect a variation in @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "it is an old argument  @xcite that observations can not measure directly fundamental dimensional constants .",
    "only dimensionless constants such as the fine structure constant can be measured , which involves the dimensional constants @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , we can form theoretical prejudices about which dimensional constants are responsible for a variation of dimensionless fundamental constants and this entails different models that describe the variation of these constants . moreover",
    ", independent observational evidence can be obtained that can rule out one or another of these models .    in the following",
    ", we shall study a simple model that incorporates a vsl behaviour in a cosmological setting , assuming that the electric charge @xmath3 and planck s constant @xmath5 are truly constants of nature . a detailed analysis of a possible variation in the electric charge @xmath3 was given by bekenstein  @xcite , in which the local gauge invariance of the electromagnetic field was preserved , although conservation of charge was broken .",
    "more recently , bekenstein s model has been reanalyzed in a cosmological setting by sandvik , barrow and magueijo  @xcite .",
    "one of bekenstein s conclusions , based on reasonable physical assumptions , was that spatial gradients of the electric charge would cause a large discrepancy with the weak equivalence principle experiments  @xcite .",
    "if such a violation of the weak equivalence principle is extrapolated back to red shifts in the early matter dominated era of the universe , when the density of matter was greater , then such spatial gradient violations could be so large as to imply a significant violation of the weak equivalence principle in that era .",
    "variations of planck s constant @xmath5 at red shifts of order @xmath6 could significantly affect atomic and molecular spectral line observations and other quantum phenomena . in view of this , we find that the possibility of a varying speed of light is more attractive , even though our understanding of special relativity , general relativity and spacetime will be significantly altered",
    ". we should also emphasize that a vsl explanation of a varying fine structure constant has the important theoretical consequence of being able to resolve the initial value problems of cosmology , whereas at this stage of our theoretical understanding , it is not clear what advantages there could be for a varying @xmath3 or @xmath5 .    in maxwell s theory , the speed of light is predicted from the equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability of the vacuum , respectively .",
    "if we have a varying speed of light , then we can write @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a function of the spacetime coordinates .",
    "this implies that we picture the vacuum as a variable medium and the velocity of electromagnetic waves depends on the magnitude of @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , the increase in the value of @xmath4 in the early universe would be traced to a phase transition in the function @xmath11 , associated with a spontaneous symmetry breaking of lorentz invariance of the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "once @xmath11 is treated as a function of the spacetime coordinates , then we can no longer simply change units such that @xmath12 .",
    "we shall use a simple minimal scheme to illustrate physical consequences of a vsl , and defer the investigation of a more geometrically rigorous theory of vsl , such as the bimetric theory  @xcite to a future publication . in a minimally coupled vsl theory ,",
    "one replaces @xmath4 by a field in a preferred frame of reference , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the present value of the speed of light .",
    "the dynamical variables in the action are the metric @xmath15 , matter variables contained in the matter action , and the scalar field @xmath16 which is assumed not to couple to the metric explicitly  @xcite . in the preferred frame",
    "the curvature tensor is to be calculated from @xmath15 at constant @xmath16 in the normal manner .",
    "varying the action with respect to the metric gives the field equations @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the cosmological constant and @xmath20 denotes the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this theory is not locally lorentz invariant . choosing a specific time to be the comoving proper time , and assuming that the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic ,",
    "so that @xmath4 only depends on time @xmath21 , then the frw metric can still be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 for spatially flat , closed and open universes , respectively .",
    "the einstein equations are still of the form @xmath24 @xmath25 the conservation equations are modified due to the time dependence of @xmath4 ( we assume that @xmath26 is constant ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 . we can fit the present cosmological data by choosing @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33  @xcite .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , and subsequently in refs .",
    "@xcite , vsl theories can solve the horizon , flatness and particle relic problems of early universe cosmology , when @xmath34 takes on large values in the very early universe .",
    "the basic problem of the existence of cosmological horizons in the standard big bang model , leads to the puzzle that regions that have not be in causal contact have the same physical properties .",
    "this puzzle is solved in vsl theories by considering the proper distance @xmath35 for a large increase in the value of @xmath36 corresponding to light travelling faster in the early universe , it is possible for the horizon to be much larger , so that all regions in our past have been in causal contact .",
    "the flatness problem is also explained , for if the speed of light undergoes a sharp change in a phase transition , then it can be shown that @xmath37 is an attractor solution for @xmath38 , i.e. the speed of light decreases as the universe expands .",
    "we model @xmath34 by @xmath39},\\ ] ] where @xmath40 denotes the present age of the universe and @xmath41 is a positive constant .",

    "this sharp increase in @xmath36 corresponds to a phase transition in the function @xmath51 , in eq.([vacuumchi ] ) , such that @xmath52 .",
    "let us write @xmath53 where we have assumed that @xmath3 and @xmath5 are strictly constants of nature , @xmath54 denotes the present value of @xmath2 and @xmath55 .",

    "0.3 true in    we have shown that a varying speed of light can explain the reported variations in the fine structure constant , while satisfying all the observational bounds . in particular , we can maintain the good agreement with the cmb data and the big bang nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "our simple model for a varying fine structure constant is phenomenological in nature and serves the purpose of showing that a vsl model can be consistent with the data , while resolving the initial value problems in cosmology .",
    "a more fundamental model can be based on a covariant bimetric formulation of speed of light and gravitational wave speed , in which two light cones expand or contract in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "more research will be needed to resolve the issue as to which fundamental constants are varying and causing the reported variation in the fine structure constant .",
