    "the group - iii nitrides gan and inn and their alloys have been receiving considerable attention for high - power , high - frequency , and high - temperature optoelectronic applications , such as light emitting and laser diodes . by changing composition one can , in principle , continuously tune the band gap from 0.8  ev ( inn)@xcite to 3.5  ev ( gan )  a range that spans much of the visible spectrum . however , because of the large lattice mismatch between gan and inn ( @xmath6 for the @xmath7 and @xmath8-directions in the wurtzite structure ) , the solid solution has a tendency to undergo phase separation .",
    "@xcite gan , inn and their alloys ( in@xmath0ga@xmath1n ) , grown under ambient conditions , typically assume the hexagonal wurtzite ( wz ) crystal structure.@xcite it is possible , however , to grow thin epitaxial films of in@xmath0ga@xmath1n  with the cubic zinc - blende ( zb ) structure.@xcite the phase stability of in@xmath0ga@xmath1n  alloys has been the subject of several experimental@xcite and theoretical studies@xcite .",
    "for example , there have been more than ten calculations of the in@xmath0ga@xmath1n  pseudo - binary phase diagram .",
    "these have included valence - force field ( vff)@xcite , tight - binding , and density functional calculations@xcite , sometimes combined with atomic - scale monte carlo simulations@xcite .",
    "surprisingly , there is considerable discrepancy in the predicted miscibility gap .",
    "the tendency for phase separation is largely driven by the relatively large misfit strains@xcite . the predicted critical temperature varies over a 2000  k range , with most calculations predicting @xmath9 .",
    "the source of this discrepancy may be associated with the accuracy of the description of the atomic interactions , the need for a statistically meaningful description of the distribution of ga and in on the solid solution cation sites and the contribution to the free energy associated with configurational entropy@xcite . additionally , the vibrational contribution to the free energy has never been included . in the present paper ,",
    "we report the results of the most rigorous calculation of this phase diagram performed to date .",
    "the results clearly demonstrate the importance of the vibrational contribution in determining phase diagrams in semiconductor alloys , such as in@xmath0ga@xmath1n .    in this work ,",
    "we employ accurate density - functional theory ( dft ) to examine the thermodynamic properties of both wurtzite and zinc - blende in@xmath0ga@xmath1n .",
    "we directly compare the formation enthalpy and free energy differences determined using exactly the same pseudopotentials and energy cutoff for both structures . using these results",
    ", we predict the binodal and spinodal on the binary phase diagram ; delineating the miscibility gap and the region where the solid solution is unstable .",
    "the simulation method uses the special quasirandom structure ( sqs ) formalism@xcite to faithfully ( and efficiently ) represent the structure of the random alloy .",
    "the effect of lattice vibrations , often neglected in semiconductor alloy thermodynamic calculations , is included in a harmonic approximation where the dynamical matrix is determined using density - functional theory methods . even though lattice vibration effects have been shown to be significant for the thermodynamic properties of some intermetallics@xcite ,",
    "the effects of vibration have been commonly neglected for semiconductor alloys .",
    "such effects were not previously included , in part , because an accurate treatment of lattice vibrations requires substantial computing resources , above that needed for modeling the effects of alloying on the heat of formation .",
    "advances in first - principles computational methods and hardware make routine inclusion of vibrational effects in alloy phase diagram calculations possible .",
    "as we demonstrate below , lattice vibrations can drastically alter calculated thermodynamic properties and phase diagrams of in@xmath0ga@xmath1n .",
    "this work provides the first direct evaluation of the significance of lattice vibration effects on the phase diagram of compound semiconductor alloys  a large and technologically important class of complex alloys . earlier work on solid solution semiconductor alloys si - ge@xcite and",
    "ga@xmath1in@xmath10p@xcite suggested that lattice vibration effects are negligible . on the other hand , inclusion of these effects on metallic compounds ( intermetallics )",
    "have been shown to be important in determining phase stability in the cd - mg@xcite , al - sc@xcite , cu - au@xcite , and al - cu@xcite systems .",
    "however , vibration effects have been shown to be relatively unimportant in other metallic systems that exhibit compound formation , e.g. , ni - al@xcite and pd - v@xcite .",
    "the previous work on the phase stability of metals suggests that vibrational effects may or may not be important in those systems .",
    "further , there is no evidence to support the idea that one can extrapolate from metals to compound semiconductor alloys .",
    "the solid state in@xmath0ga@xmath1n  phase diagrams , determined herein , represent the most rigorous determinations reported to - date .",
    "the resultant phase diagram shows that the wurtzite crystal structure is more stable than the zinc - blende structure over the entire in@xmath0ga@xmath1ncomposition and temperature ranges examined .",
    "due to its low computation cost and relative accuracy , valence - force - field ( vff ) models@xcite have been used extensively to study@xcite the in@xmath0ga@xmath1nalloy system .",
    "one of the first in@xmath0ga@xmath1n  phase diagram calculations was performed by ho and stringfellow@xcite , who employed a vff model to investigate the solid phase miscibility gap in zinc - blende in@xmath0ga@xmath1n .",

    "they found that while vff works reasonably well for some zinc - blende iii / v semiconductors , significant errors occur for group iii nitrides ( gan , inn ) .",
    "in particular , the formation energies for alloys are significantly underestimated ( by 14  mev / cation ) .",
    "these findings suggest that the critical temperature of in@xmath0ga@xmath1nobtained from first - principles calculations should be higher than those from vff calculations .",
    "however , this conclusion is inconsistent with the predictions of vff@xcite and first - principles results@xcite ( i.e. , the @xmath12 values from vff studies exceed those from first - principles calculations ) .",
    "our results , presented below , shed light on this discrepancy .",
    "the effects of disorder on the stability and structure of alloys have received considerable attention over the past few decades .",
    "the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite for describing such effects is a single - site theory that treats the random a@xmath0b@xmath1 alloys by considering the average occupations of lattice sites by atoms a and b. hence the effects of local environment such as charge transfer , local chemical environment , and local structural relaxation are ignored .",
    "however , local environment effects have been shown to be important in determining the thermodynamics and electronic properties of alloys@xcite .",
    "one approach to incorporate the local environment effect is through first - principles density - functional theory .",
    "one can , in principle , model a disordered a@xmath0b@xmath1 system using a plane - wave density - functional methods with a large supercell in which a and b are distributed at random on lattice sites .",
    "unfortunately , since computational costs in such methods usually scale with the number of atoms in the supercell , @xmath13 as @xmath14 , one is usually forced to use a small supercell",
    ". small supercells invariably lead to poor statistics and spurious correlations ( i.e. , this approach leads to a chemical environment about each site which is different from that in a large , truly random system ) .",
    "et al._@xcite recognized that most physical properties are governed by atomic interactions between near neighbors and developed a method to generate atomic arrangements in small supercells that correctly reproduce the short and intermediate range correlations that exist in random alloys .",
    "these structures are called special - quasirandom - structures ( sqs ) .",
    "a useful approach to defining correlation functions in crystals with different site occupancies is to assign each site @xmath15 a variable according to the type of occupying atom , say @xmath16 for an a atom and @xmath17 for an b atom .",
    "next , we make a list of pairs of atoms in our structure that are separated by @xmath18 or less nearest neighbor distances and evaluate the product @xmath19 for that particular pair of atoms on sites @xmath15 and @xmath20 .",
    "averaging this value over all such pairs in the structure yields the correlation function @xmath21 , where the two indicates we are considering pairs .",
    "we can use a similar procedure for triplets , quadruplets , .. @xmath22-lets of atoms to produce a series of correlation functions @xmath23 .",

    "we have implemented the sqs algorithm for different unit cell sizes and shapes , generating all possible site occupancies for the chosen @xmath25 , calculating @xmath23 and keeping the configuration for which the set of @xmath26 is closest to @xmath27 . in practice , we use only @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we repeat this procedure for different unit cell shapes , as described by the supercell lattice vectors @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , and retain the one that leads to the best correlation with random occupancy ( using our implementation of the procedure described in refs . ) .    in this work",
    "we have focused on wurtzite and zinc - blende crystal structures with 16 cations and 16 anions per unit cell .",
    "the occupancies , in our case correspond to ga or in on the cation sites .",
    "the descriptions of the hexagonal - close - packed ( hcp ) and face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) sublattices are shown in tables  [ tab : wurtzitesqs16 ] and [ tab : zinc - blendesqs16 ] , respectively . for @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 ) , the wurtzite structure delivers exact matches up to @xmath35 and up to @xmath36 for @xmath37 . for the zinc - blende structure",
    ", we find structures that yield correlation functions that exactly match the random case up to @xmath38 for @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 ) and to @xmath36 for @xmath39 .",
    "unlike in previous studies of in@xmath0ga@xmath1n  alloys@xcite , the present analysis provides a quantitative measure of the degree to which the simulation cell resembles a random alloy .",
    "based on the quoted pair statistics , we conclude that the unit cells and occupancies employed herein provide good representations of the set of wurtzite and zinc - blende random alloys .",
    "we first optimize the zinc - blende ( wurtzite ) gan and inn structures with respect to the atomic coordinates and the unit cell parameter(s ) @xmath7 ( and @xmath8 ) using the first - principles density - functional@xcite method within the local density approximation ( lda ) .",

    "a @xmath41 mesh is used for the 8-atom zinc - blende inn and gan unit cells ( finer meshes resulted in total energy changes of less than 0.1  mev / atom ) .",
    "table  [ tab : acu ] shows that the relaxed lattice parameters for gan and inn in both the wurtzite and zinc - blende structures are in good agreement with other theoretical and experimental work .",
    "the wurtzite gan ( inn ) structures have lower total energies than zinc - blende gan ( inn ) by 13  mev / cation ( 18  mev / cation ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the calculations of groose and neugebauer , where the wurtzite gan ( inn ) is lower in total energy than the zinc - blende gan ( inn ) by 11  mev / cation ( 19  mev / cation ) .",
    "we determine the equilibrium structure by minimizing the total energy of the system with respect to the lattice parameters and the positions of each of the 32 ions within the sqs cell .",

    ", it also modifies the solubility limits of each component and does so in a non - symmetric manner .",
    "the present results also point to the importance of determining all of the contributions to the free energy self - consistently ; that is using the same energetics description for relaxing the atomic structures , calculating enthalpies of formation and vibrational contributions to the free energy .",
    "while the present results represents a significant advance in compound semiconductor alloy phase diagram calculations , further improvements should include the effects of short range order in the disordered phase and better approximations to the entropy of mixing ( see e.g. , ref .  ) .",
