    "the key to understanding accretion disk dynamics lies with the angular momentum transport mechanism .",
    "since the molecular viscosity of disks is very low , some form of `` anomalous viscosity '' must be present .",
    "although the precise nature of this anomalous viscosity has long been elusive , the discovery that differentially rotating systems are magnetohydrodynamically ( mhd ) unstable ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) has led to the conclusion that fully ionized disks must be mhd turbulent . because this magnetorotational instability is caused by angular momentum transport ,",
    "the resulting turbulence has precisely the right character to transport angular momentum outwards ( balbus , hawley & stone 1996 , hereafter bhs96 ) , as required for disks to accrete .",
    "since the mhd instability plays such a fundamental role in disks , the question naturally arises , what is its behavior when the plasma is not fully ionized ?",
    "protostellar and protoplanetary disks as well as other molecular disks are the venues where this question is particularly significant .",
    "although it is tempting to assume that in the absence of mhd turbulence , purely hydrodynamical turbulence will rise to the task of transporting angular momentum , this now seems highly unlikely .",
    "bhs96 demonstrated , through a combination of analysis and simulation , that differentially rotating systems are both linearly and nonlinearly locally stable to hydrodynamic perturbations so long as the standard rayleigh criterion is satisfied . even if initiated `` by hand , ''",
    "hydrodynamic turbulence is not self - sustaining .",
    "outward transport of angular momentum through a net reynolds stress requires a specific average correlation between the radial velocity and the angular momentum fluctuations in the turbulent flow .",
    "of fundamental importance is the interaction of these velocity fluctuations with the background mean flow . in differentially rotating systems",
    "the source of free energy is the angular velocity gradient .",
    "angular momentum fluctuations , on the other hand , act to reduce the background angular _ momentum _ gradient , which has the opposite sign from the angular velocity gradient . a positive value of the reynolds stress , required to tap into the free energy of the system , acts as a sink term for the evolution of the angular velocity fluctuations that make up the reynolds stress itself .",
    "thus the turbulence is not self - sustaining .    the results of bhs96 further imply that enhanced angular momentum transport is not the necessary outcome of turbulence . because transport requires a high degree of correlation between the radial and azimuthal velocity fluctuations , turbulence that does not have its origin in the mean differentially rotating flow is unlikely to be an efficient source of angular momentum transport .",
    "this point is emphasized by stone & balbus ( 1996 ) , whose numerical simulation showed that while vertical convection can generate turbulence , the resulting net radial angular momentum transport was _ inward _ at a low rate ( so long as the equator was kept hot by the boundary conditions of the simulation ) .",
    "similar results were found by cabot ( 1996 ) .",
    "simulations by ryu & goodman ( 1994 ) of the action of a parametric tidal instability on a disk show the generation of turbulence , but without internal transport .",
    "these studies provide compelling evidence that the idea of purely hydrodynamic turbulence as an _ angular momentum transport mechanism _ in protostellar disks should be discarded .",
    "if turbulence is to be driven by the differential rotation , it must be mhd turbulence .",
    "if hydrodynamic turbulence is present , it must be driven by some source other than the background shear and generally will not transport angular momentum .",
    "such considerations are particularly important if turbulence is important in protoplanetary disks for chondrule and planetesimal formation ( e.g. , cuzzi , dobrovolskis & hogan 1996 ) .",
    "it now appears that the number of different mechanisms for transporting angular momentum in disks is very limited .",
    "magnetic fields and spiral wave disturbances ( nonaxisymmetric distortions ) are the only viable general mechanisms . in the latter category , and within the context of protostellar disks ,",
    "nonaxisymmetric gravitational instabilities may be important .",
    "global wave mechanisms , however , are not normally associated with the generation of local turbulence .",
    "the dynamics of a disk controlled by such global waves will be quite different from a model based upon the usual local @xmath2 prescription for viscosity , which is itself based upon the ansatz of transport by local turbulent stresses .    for protostellar disks",
    "we are forced to reckon with questions of the effectiveness of magnetic field coupling .",
    "there is , of course , nothing about this issue that is unique to the magnetorotational instability .",
    "if the magnetic field is not well coupled to the fluid , then all potential mhd processes in the disk will be affected .",
    "it is difficult to imagine , for example , a scenario in which a weak field in a disk is stablized by low ion - neutral coupling , yet remains involved in , say , a kinematic dynamo .",
    "if a protostellar disk or rotating molecular cloud is sufficiently well - coupled to a weak magnetic field for the field to be important in any way , then the magnetorotational instability is an important dynamical factor .    under what circumstances , then , will the instability operate and produce mhd turbulence in protoplanetary disks where the ionization fraction is quite low ?",
    "the first step towards answering this question was taken by blaes & balbus ( 1994 , hereafter bb ) , who performed an axisymmetric linear stability analysis for a vertical ( and toroidal ) field in a weakly ionized plasma for a number of limits .",
    "their major finding is that the linear magnetorotational instability is present so long as the ion - neutral collision frequency exceeds the local epicyclic frequency .",
    "this condition will be satisfied even for very small ionization fractions .",
    "they also found that azimuthal fields can reduce the observed growth rates , although such fields do not eliminate the instability .",
    "while a linear analysis can indicate the presence or absence of the instability , its effectiveness as a transport mechanism must be determined by its nonlinear evolution .",
    "the first numerical study of the two - fluid magnetorotational instability was carried out by mac low et al .",
    "they assume ionization - recombination equilibrium and consider the low - ionization limit , neglecting the ion pressure and inertia .",
    "this reduces the problem to a single - fluid ( neutral ) plus a diffusion term in the induction equation ( ambipolar diffusion limit ) . using the zeus code they carried out a series of two - dimensional simulations of the vertical flux tube problem ( as in hawley & balbus 1991 ) for various ion - neutral coupling strengths .",
    "although these simulations did not follow the evolution much beyond the linear stage , the results were in agreement with the stability analysis of bb in the appropriate limit .",
    "essentially , so long as there are unstable wavelengths available , and the coupling between ions and neutrals is sufficiently strong , the instability behaves much like the single fluid case .",
    "the instability ceases to operate when the ambipolar diffusion rate becomes comparable to the growth rate of the instability , i.e. , the field diffusion time is @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is the disk orbital frequency .    in another study ,",
    "brandenburg et al .",
    "( 1995 ) investigated the ambipolar diffusion limit in three - dimensional simulations of a local , vertically stratified disk .",
    "they considered a case where the ambipolar diffusion time was long compared to the orbital time .",
    "they found that in this limit ( i.e. , ambipolar diffusion sufficiently small ) the instability remains effective , and continues to generate self - sustained turbulence that transports angular momentum outward , albeit at a rate slightly reduced from the fully - coupled case . in another simulation , the diffusion time",
    "was set comparable to @xmath4 and the turbulence decayed .    these first results , while important , are only a beginning . to date , all the numerical studies have considered the behavior of the partially ionized system in the limit where the inertia of the ions can be completely neglected , and where the ion density is everywhere a fixed power - law function of the neutral density . in this paper",
    "we will approach the problem using a genuine two - fluid , ion - neutral evolution to examine effects where the ions are free to move relative to the neutrals .",
    "we will investigate the transition from the well - coupled regime , through critical coupling where the collision frequency is comparable to the epicyclic frequency , and down to the fully uncoupled limit .",
    "this parameter study should more clearly define the physical conditions for which full mhd turbulence and accompanying angular momentum transport can be expected , and those for which the bulk of the system dynamics are essentially hydrodynamic .",
    "the full range of conditions is likely to be of importance somewhere within protostellar or protoplanetary disks . in some regions of these disk systems",
    ", the ionization fractions may be quite small , but in other regions , such as near the forming protostar , the temperatures will be high , and the gas will be nearly fully ionized . in between , there will be a transition region . determining the size of this transition region , and delineating its properties , will depend on obtaining a better understanding of the nonlinear behavior of the ion - neutral system in various regimes .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we will consider the equations and the numerical techniques used to solve them . although the collision term is handled semi - implicitly , the use of explicit finite - differencing for the remainder of the system makes the code courant - limited . as a test problem",
    ", we compare numerical growth rates with analytic values from bb . in ",
    "3 we present the results of an extensive ensemble of simulations , covering a range of ionization fractions and coupling frequencies .",
    "because of the courant limit , this study is limited to relatively large ionization fractions @xmath5 . in the linear limit , however , the growth rates for small ionization fractions are relatively unaffected by decreasing @xmath6 , if the ratio of the coupling frequency to orbital frequency is held constant .",
    "thus , we expect that physical insights gained by this study should extend even into the small @xmath6 regime .",
    "the implications of the simulations will be summarized and discussed in  4 .",
    "in these simulations we will be studying the simple two - fluid system as described in  3 of bb , consisting of separate compressible ion and neutral fluids , coupled only by collisions .",
    "the ion fluid is assumed to be perfectly conducting .",
    "we include no ionization or recombination ; ions and neutrals are separately conserved .",
    "we have examined both isothermal systems , and ones where the two fluids can have different temperatures and no thermal coupling is included .    as in previous work ( hawley ,",
    "gammie & balbus 1995 , hereafter hgb95 ) we restrict our attention to the local hill ( 1878 ) system representation of a disk .",
    "this model incorporates coriolis and tidal forces , and is constructed by expanding the equations of motion in cylindrical coordinates @xmath7 to first order around a fiducial radius @xmath8 using a set of local cartesian coordinates @xmath9 , z)$ ] .",
    "the rotation law is assumed to have the form @xmath10 ; for a keplerian disk @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting equations for the ions , neutrals , and magnetic field are @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 where the terms have their usual meaning , the subscripts @xmath17 and @xmath18 refer to the neutrals and ions respectively , and @xmath19 is the drag coefficient due to collisions between the two fluids . in addition , there is an equation of state ( we use either an adiabatic or an isothermal equation of state ) for the neutrals and for the ions . in these equations we neglect vertical gravity and assume that the ion component is a perfectly conducting fluid .",
    "while there are physically important regimes where resistivity will be important ( see , e.g. , the discussion in bb ) , we make this assumption to simplify the parameters of the present study .",
    "the results of this paper will correspond to the most favorable conditions for the mhd instability since finite resistivity would be expected to reduce the levels of the resulting turbulence .",
    "equations ( 1)(5 ) amount to separate hydrodynamical ( neutrals ) and mhd ( ions ) systems , coupled by the collisional drag term .",
    "we use the hydrodynamical algorithms described by stone & norman ( 1992a ) to evolve the equations for the neutrals ( eqs . [ 12 ] and [ 4 ] ) , and the mocct algorithm ( stone & norman 1992b ; hawley & stone 1995 ) to evolve the ions ( eqs . [ 3 ] and [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the collisional drag term @xmath19 in both equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is operator - split and updated using fully implicit backward euler differencing ( a complete description of the resulting difference equations is given in stone 1997 ) .",
    "this avoids the courant stability criterion associated with diffusion of the magnetic field that restricts explicit differencing formalisms of the drag term .",
    "the resulting hybrid hydrodynamical - mhd code has been tested with steady c - type shock solutions and comparison to the analytic growth rate of the wardle instability ( stone 1997 ) .",
    "we describe a comparison of the numerical growth rate of the magnetorotational instability in a partially ionized disk with the analytic value from bb in  2.2 below .",
    "the computations are done in the periodic three - dimensional ( 3d ) shearing box ( hgb95 ) . in this system",
    "the computational domain is a rectangular box with sides @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and it is assumed to be surrounded by identical boxes that are strictly periodic at @xmath22 .",
    "a large - scale continuous linear shear flow is present across all the boxes . at later times",
    "the computational box remains periodic in @xmath23 and @xmath24 , while the radial ( @xmath25 ) boundary condition is determined by the location of the neighboring boxes as they move relative to one another due to the background shear .",
    "we use box dimensions of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , as in previous single - fluid simulations ( hgb95 ) .",
    "the initial equilibrium system has a keplerian rotation law ( @xmath11 ) ; the angular speed at the center of the shearing box is @xmath0 .",
    "the initial state has constant densities and pressures ( ion and neutral ) . for most experiments we use an isothermal equation of state ; in a few simulations we use of an adiabatic equation of state with @xmath29 . the mean molecular weight of the ions and the neutrals can be specified separately ; for most simulations we adopt the weights used in bb , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "these numbers come from assuming that the neutrals are hydrogen and helium molecules while the ions correspond to trace alkali species ( draine , roberge , & dalgarno 1983 ) . assuming thermal equilibrium , the ratio of the initial sound speeds in the neutrals and ions is equal to the square root of the ratio of the mean molecular weights .",
    "one of the difficulties of this study is the wide range of possible physical parameters that could be investigated . among these",
    "are the equation of state , neutral to ion mass ratio , initial field strength and orientation , the initial ionization fraction @xmath5 , and the collisional frequency , @xmath32",
    ". our primary focus will be on the role of the collisional drag term @xmath19 . in the limit of @xmath33 ,",
    "the ion and neutral fluids decouple ; the ions evolve as in the magnetized single - fluid case , while the neutrals evolve hydrodynamically . in the other extreme , @xmath34",
    ", the system reduces to a single well - coupled fluid . in this study",
    ", we will examine a range of collisional frequencies on either side of the critical frequency , @xmath35 , by treating @xmath19 as a free parameter and varying it for given values of ionization fraction and @xmath0 .",
    "the courant condition from the ion alfvn speed limits the simulations to moderate values of the ionization fraction @xmath36 .",
    "as bb have shown , it is the ratio of the collisional frequency to the orbital frequency that determines the linear behavior of the instability . assuming this holds even into the nonlinear regime",
    ", our results should be able to set important limits even for significantly smaller , and hence more realistic , ionization fractions .      as a simple verification test of the two - fluid code , we compare observed growth rates in the linear regime of the instability with analytic values from bb .",
    "( similar tests were performed for the fully - coupled , single - fluid system by hawley and balbus 1992 . )",
    "we choose an initial magnetic field strength corresponding to @xmath37 , run several models with @xmath38 and different values @xmath19 , and compare the observed growth rate in the perturbed magnetic radial field @xmath39 with the value given by the dispersion relation ( bb eq .",
    "[ 25 ] ) for the largest vertical wavelength permitted by the computational domain .",
    "the particular initial magnetic field strength used makes the ( analytically determined ) fastest growing wavelength close to the domain size @xmath40 .",
    "we use two resolutions , @xmath41 and @xmath42 grid zones ; these are the @xmath43 resolutions that will be used in the 3d simulations to follow .",
    "the numerical growth rates , in units of @xmath0 , are plotted on top of an analytic growth rate curve obtained from equation ( 24 ) of bb ( fig .",
    "1 ) . as can be seen from the figure , the two - fluid code reproduces the analytic linear growth rates for the range of collision frequencies considered .",
    "there is not much difference between the high and low resolution simulations ; the long wavelength modes considered here are adequately resolved by either grid .",
    "in this paper our primary focus will be on an initially uniform vertical magnetic field , @xmath44 .",
    "the single - fluid , fully - ionized version of this problem was investigated by hgb95 , and we begin with a brief summary of their results .",
    "the maximum growth rate of the single - fluid system is @xmath45 .",
    "hgb95 found this growth rate for wavenumbers @xmath46 in all simulations where the fastest growing wavelength is adequately resolved on the grid .",
    "the fastest growing mode is axisymmetric and leads to flow along radial `` channels . ''",
    "outward flowing channels contain excess angular momentum , while inward flowing channels have less than the keplerian value .",
    "when the fastest growing mode has a vertical wavelength greater than or equal to the radial dimension of the box , this axisymmetric mode continues to grow exponentially well into the strong field regime .",
    "however , for smaller vertical wavelengths ( larger vertical wavenumbers ) , the channels break down into turbulence .",
    "these numerical results can be understood through the analysis of goodman & xu ( 1994 ) who found that , in the local limit and for a uniform vertical field , the exponentially - growing linear solution is also an exact _ nonlinear _ solution .",
    "goodman & xu further carried out a stability analysis of the streaming channel solution and found that it was subject to a number of instabilities .",
    "the most important of these parasitic instabilities is a magnetized kelvin - helmholtz mode that is present for radial wavelengths larger than the channel solution s vertical wavelength .",
    "thus , under most circumstances , the channel solution is unstable , and the general outcome of the instability is turbulence .",
    "the resulting turbulence is nonisotropic ; correlated fluctuations in the magnetic and velocity fields transfer angular momentum outward through the action of the maxwell ( magnetic ) and the reynolds stresses .",
    "accretion disk models often make use of the shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) parameterization for the stress @xmath47 , scaling it with the total pressure , @xmath48 . in the mhd turbulence",
    ", however , the level of net transport depends primarily upon the magnetic field levels in the saturated turbulent state .",
    "the stress is proportional to the _ magnetic _ pressure with a ratio of the stress to @xmath49 of about 0.6 .",
    "we refer to this ratio as @xmath50 .",
    "the complete ensemble of hgb95 vertical field simulations provides an empirical relation for the average magnetic field energy in the turbulence : it is proportional to the product of the fastest growing initial wavelength and the maximum possible unstable wavelength permitted in the computational domain . from hgb95 , we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fastest growing wavelength for the initial magnetic field ( @xmath53^{1/2 } v_a / \\omega$ ] ) .",
    "a best fit to the hgb95 simulations gives a constant of proportionality of 1.2 .",
    "in essence , the final energy is the geometric average of the energy of the _ net _ vertical field piercing the box ( which , because of the periodic boundary conditions does not change as a result of the evolution ) and the energy of the largest magnetic field that would be unstable given the dimension @xmath21 . the box dimension @xmath21 was set equal to @xmath54 to represent a disk scale height , although vertical gravity was not included in these simulations .",
    "the growth of the instability and its saturation level are unaffected by the hydrodynamic pressure in the box ; the magnetic field energy remains subthermal ( since the dimensions of the computational domain were chosen so that the sound speed was equal to @xmath55 . )",
    "the saturation amplitude is also unaffected by the presence of a subthermal toroidal field except to the extent that such a toroidal field and its instabilities add to the total magnetic energy .",
    "we now turn to the two - fluid system and begin with a simple initial field geometry , a uniform @xmath44 field ; in subsequent sections we consider the evolution of @xmath44 fields with zero net flux , uniform @xmath56 fields , and mixtures of these cases .",
    "in the two - fluid systems there are two identifiable limits in which the single - fluid results should apply : @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "when @xmath57 the ions are completely decoupled from the neutrals and their evolution will be as a single fluid with the ion density and ion alfvn speed determining the final magnetic energy levels . in the other limit , the system will again behave as a single fluid , but with the _ total _ density determining the alfvn speed and saturation energies .",
    "bb point out that the linear properties of the two - fluid system can be understood in terms of the `` effective '' density of the system , which varies between @xmath59 and @xmath60 depending on the strength of the coupling .",
    "since @xmath61 , the scaling relation ( 6 ) implies that the ratio of the magnetic energy in the decoupled ( @xmath62 ) limit to the magnetic energy in the fully coupled ( @xmath63 ) limit will be @xmath64 , for fixed initial magnetic field strength .",
    "we will explore the properties of the transition region between these two limits by varying the drag coefficient @xmath19 , the ionization fraction @xmath6 , and other variables such as the equation of state and initial field strength in a number of different models .",
    "we begin our discussion with a baseline simulation against which to compare other models .",
    "this fiducial run ( z17 ) is a two - fluid shearing box with @xmath65 resolution , the standard survey resolution .",
    "( the complete list of vertical field simulations is provided in table 1 . )",
    "we set the neutral density @xmath66 , and the neutral sound speed @xmath67 , with @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the ion fraction is set to @xmath38 .",
    "this , together with a the drag coefficient @xmath70 , yields a coupling frequency of @xmath71 , just above the critical value .",
    "we use an isothermal equation of state , and assume a ratio of ion to neutral mass @xmath72 of @xmath73 .",
    "the ion sound speed is equal to @xmath74 .",
    "the assumption that the ions and neutrals have the same temperature establishes the relative pressures .",
    "the initial field is a uniform @xmath44 field with strength @xmath75 , which corresponds to a value of @xmath76 .",
    "from the linear dispersion relation [ eq .",
    "( 24 ) of bb ] we find that the unstable growth rates increase with increasing wavenumber , from a rate of @xmath77 for @xmath78 to @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "smaller wavelengths are also unstable with comparable growth rates , up to the limit of @xmath81 , but such wavelengths are not well resolved .",
    "the uniform initial conditions are perturbed with small , random fluctuations in the ion and neutral pressures .",
    "the magnetic field energy grows exponentially for the first three orbits before leveling out after orbit 4 ( fig .",
    "the numerical growth rate of the instability is computed from the slope of the radial field energy density curve .",
    "the radial field perturbation grows at a rate of @xmath82 , equal to the analytic value for @xmath83 . at 4.6 orbits plots of variables such as the @xmath39 magnetic field",
    "show significant @xmath80 structure . at this point ,",
    "the system is largely axisymmetric , having the appearance of the channel solutions previously seen in pure @xmath44 single fluid simulations ( hawley & balbus 1992 ; hgb95 ) .    at orbit 15 the toroidal field",
    "is dominated by a nearly axisymmetric @xmath84 structure .",
    "the ions are greatly affected by the field since the toroidal field is now superthermal with @xmath85 .",
    "filaments of high density ions are sandwiched between these regions of strong toroidal field ( fig .",
    "the maximum ion density in the filaments is 2.5 times the average value .",
    "since the neutral density has a much smaller relative variation , the ionization fraction in the filaments has gone up by a comparable amount .",
    "the neutral density plot shows much less small scale structure ; the neutrals are dominated by trailing @xmath86 pressure waves that are nearly independent of @xmath24 .",
    "these have a maximum @xmath87 of about 10% .",
    "thus considerable separation of the ions from the neutrals occurs when the coupling frequency is comparable to the orbital frequency .",
    "figure 2 shows significant magnetic energy fluctuations after saturation .",
    "representative values are obtained by time and space averages ; some of these values are listed in table 2 .",
    "the time - averaged magnetic field energy after saturation is @xmath88 ; the majority of the energy is in the toroidal field with @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "since the toroidal field grows by both the action of the instability and the background shear flow , the amplitude of the poloidal fields provides the best measure of the turbulence . in this simulation the poloidal fields are considerably smaller than in single fluid runs .",
    "for example , in the fiducial run of hgb95 @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "interestingly , the average magnetic field energy in the two - fluid system lies below both of the two single - fluid limits given by equation ( 6 ) , either the one appropriate for the ions alone , or the one appropriate to the total density of ions plus neutrals .",
    "this implies that near the critical coupling frequency the neutrals primarily act as a drag to reduce the vigor of the field amplification , the mhd turbulence and the resulting transport .",
    "the time - averaged perturbed kinetic energies in the ions are @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "the evolution of the ion and neutral kinetic energy is depicted in fig .",
    "the volume - averaged kinetic energy of the neutrals evolves closely with that of the ions , except that it is larger by nearly the ratio @xmath96 .",
    "the ion velocities are slightly larger on average .    as in the single - fluid case",
    ", angular momentum is transported outward by the reynolds stress ( both neutral and ion ) and by the maxwell stress .",
    "the maxwell term is the largest stress component with @xmath97 ; the neutral and ion reynolds stresses are @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "the ion reynolds stress is proportionally larger than that of the neutrals , once the neutral to ion density ratio is factored out . in these units",
    "the sum of the stresses is equal to the shakura - sunyaev @xmath2 value .",
    "single fluid simulations find that while the ratio of total stress to the total pressure can vary substantially from one simulation to another , the ratio of the stress to the _ magnetic _ pressure is more nearly constant .",
    "the direct dependence of the stress on the magnetic pressure reflects both the fundamental role that the magnetic field plays in driving both the maxwell and reynolds stresses , as well as the high degree of correlation between the radial and toroidal field components .",
    "clearly this remains true for ion - neutral systems .",
    "in the fiducial run @xmath100 , a value comparable to that seen in the single - fluid @xmath24-field simulations . despite its lower relative value compared with the single - fluid simulation , the radial field remains highly correlated with the toroidal .",
    "the ratio @xmath101 is nearly 1 during the linear growth phase and has an average value of 0.7 after saturation .",
    "the existence of unstable wavenumbers with large values , and the relatively low growth rate observed in the magnetic field , suggests that resolution may be influencing the simulation .",
    "resolution can be especially important for ion - neutral simulations , because they typically have a wider range of rapidly growing wavelengths and physically important lengthscales compared to the single fluid system .",
    "for the parameters of the fiducial run , this is certainly true , and more grid zones should be required to resolve the linear growth phase adequately compared to the one - fluid system .",
    "run lz1 doubles the resolution of the fiducial run to @xmath102 grid zones while maintaining all other initial parameters .",
    "the observed growth rate for the magnetic field in the high resolution run is @xmath103 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , 30% larger than in the lower resolution run . the most obvious mode seen in density plots during the linear growth phase",
    "has @xmath104 .",
    "although ultimately both the low and high resolution simulations are dominated by the largest scales , resolution remains an important factor throughout the simulation .",
    "the high resolution simulation has 1.8 times as much magnetic energy as the fiducial run , when compared over the same time interval after saturation .",
    "the total stress is larger by a factor of 1.4 .      in the next set of simulations , we investigate the effect of the ionization factor by comparing the fiducial run to model z20 with @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and model z21 with @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we retain the same initial alfvn speed @xmath109 as used in the fiducial run . because we hold the alfvn speed constant , the initial @xmath44 magnetic field decreases as @xmath64 .",
    "table 2 lists time and space averaged values after saturation for this set of runs .",
    "although the parameter @xmath76 is the same from one run to the next , the linear growth rates for the resolvable vertical wavelengths decrease with @xmath6 ( bb ) . for @xmath110",
    "the linear growth rates are 0.15 , 0.047 , and 0.015@xmath0 ; for @xmath83 the rates are 0.27 , 0.093 , and 0.03@xmath0 .",
    "the measured growth rates for @xmath39 in the simulations are 0.27 , 0.072 , and 0.016@xmath0 for @xmath38 , 0.01 , and 0.001 respectively .    despite the reduced growth rates , the total magnetic field _ amplification _",
    "is comparable in all three runs , about two orders of magnitude in energy .",
    "the time - averaged magnetic energy after saturation in these runs is @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "these correspond to similar saturation amplitudes in the ion alfvn speed , @xmath114 ( fig .",
    "the majority of the magnetic energy is in the toroidal component .",

    "more significantly , the relative strength of the radial field compared to the toroidal declines with @xmath6 .",
    "this means that the average @xmath50 also declines with @xmath6 ; @xmath115 , 0.2 , and 0.1 in these three runs .    as in the fiducial run ,",

    "the neutrals look similar in all three runs , again dominated by nearly @xmath24-independent trailing pressure waves .    because the three models saturate at comparable ion alfvn speeds ,",
    "we conclude that the final state depends most strongly upon the ion density , that is , the effective inertia for the instability remains close to @xmath59 . at coupling frequencies",
    "@xmath116 the role of the neutrals is mainly that of a sink for the turbulence .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the magnetic energies in these simulations are smaller than predicted from equation ( 6 ) for a single - fluid with density equal to @xmath117 .",
    "while these results imply an increasingly small angular momentum transport for increasingly small ionization factors , this is partly because we have chosen to initialize this ensemble of simulations with constant alfvn speed .",
    "an alternative is to begin with constant magnetic energy density .",

    "this is sufficiently strong that @xmath123 on average .",
    "the dominance of the magnetic pressure is again reflected in the narrow , nearly axisymmetric sheets of ions surrounded by strong toroidal field . at the end of the run , the maximum ion density is 8 times the initial value , the largest relative compression of any of this series of runs .",
    "the ion sheets have a similarity of appearance to the channel solutions seen in the single fluid simulations , except that here field amplification stops and the growth of the nonaxisymmetric parasitic instability is suppressed or significantly reduced .",

    "the ion reynolds stress is proportionally larger than the neutral stress by a factor of 7 , but , due to the low ion fraction , its absolute value makes no significant contribution .    to summarize ,",
    "we have examined three decades in ionization fraction with coupling frequencies near the orbital frequency .",
    "the observed numerical growth rates are consistent with the linear analysis of bb .",
    "further , we find that these collision frequencies are insufficient to involve the neutrals in the evolution beyond providing a drag .",
    "the saturation amplitudes are determined by the ion alfvn frequency , and low @xmath130 values . because saturation is determined mainly by the ions , and magnetic equipartition with the ion thermal energy , ion - neutral systems with very low ionization fractions and weak coupling",
    "would be expected to saturate at small magnetic field strengths .",
    "the analysis of bb highlights the importance of the ratio of the collision frequency to the epicyclic frequency . in the simulations described",
    "so far we have maintained the collision frequency near its critical value , i.e. , comparable to the epicyclic frequency .",

    "the c1 run uses an adiabatic equation of state ; the additional pressure keeps the fluid sheets resolved , permitting the computation to continue . again , this demonstrates that compressibility effects become important when @xmath143 .    the differences between",
    "the @xmath70 run ( z17 ) and the @xmath144 run ( z25 ) are small but significant .",
    "the magnetic field energies are comparable , but z25 has a 25% larger average radial magnetic field strength , and greater neutral reynolds stress leading to a 20% larger @xmath2 value .",
    "thus , an increase by 10 in the coupling frequency has had some influence on the saturation level , but has not yet brought the magnetic energies to near their single fluid values .    when the drag coefficient is increased to @xmath145 ( z28 )",

    "after saturation at orbit 7 the radial magnetic and kinetic energies are reduced compared to the fiducial run , and this reduces the total transport to @xmath177 .",
    "the total magnetic energy is slightly larger than in the fiducial run , although this is mainly because here the toroidal field _ began _ at this level .",

    "run z18 , however , saturates at a magnetic field energy level that is about twice that of z17 .",
    "since the saturated @xmath130 value is larger in z18 ( even though the magnetic field is stronger than in z17 ) , the ions are less tightly confined .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion that if the saturated magnetic energies yield @xmath179 , the gas pressure remains mostly unimportant , whereas if @xmath180 , pressure can bring field amplification to an end .",
    "the effects of pressure are particularly noticeable in the two - fluid simulations because , in contrast to previously studied single - fluid models , the magnetic pressures in the saturated states generally have @xmath178 .",

    "brandenburg & zweibel ( 1995 ) have emphasized that because ion - neutral coupling acts as a nonlinear diffusion process , certain initial field configurations can evolve into thin current sheets . because we are far from the well - coupled limit studied by brandeburg & zweibel , it is difficult to asses the relative importance of nonlinear diffusion due to ambipolar diffusion in these simulations .",

    "the ion velocity fluctuations are correlated so as to produce a net positive ion reynolds stress , and that correlation is conveyed to the neutrals . however , because the neutrals lack direct coupling to the magnetic fields , a positive reynolds stress acts as a sink in the neutral angular velocity fluctuation equation . in the intermediate coupling regime",
    "this apparently works to damp the strength of the ion turbulence to levels below what would be seen with the ion system fully decoupled",
    ".    why does gas pressure matter in these simulations and not in the single - fluid studies done previously ? in the single - fluid simulations ( hgb95 ) the gas pressure was largely irrelevant , in part because the box size was chosen so that @xmath227 and the largest unstable wavelength corresponded to a subthermal field . in the ion - neutral system as we have set it up here , fields that are superthermal in the ion pressure ( i.e. , have @xmath178 ) can still be unstable . for small ionization fractions",

    "when @xmath229 , the ion pressure significantly affects the nonlinear stage of the evolution , for both toroidal and vertical initial field models .",
    "the tendency for the ions to form thin sheets between regions of strong toroidal field is symptomatic . in some cases",
    "this reduces the vigor of the resulting turbulence .",
    "stronger turbulence and more angular momentum transport can be obtained by decreasing the ion mass , and hence increasing the ion pressure ( under the assumption of equipartition of thermal energy between the ion and neutral particles , @xmath230 ) .",
    "we consistently find stronger turbulence with higher ion pressures .",
    "when toroidal fields are included in the initial conditions along with vertical field , they can reduce linear growth rates , in accordance with the analysis of bb . however , the reduced growth rates have less of an effect once the nonlinear regime is reached .",
    "in fact , far from preventing the the growth of the instability , we find that purely toroidal initial fields are also unstable . however , the instability is significantly reduced for weak coupling if the toroidal field is superthermal .",
    "although this is true in the single fluid case as well , there it was hardly an issue because @xmath231 was already a very strong field . here",
    ", however , if @xmath232 , the ion pressure can be substantially smaller than the neutral .",
    "if the ion fraction is small , the ion alfvn speed can easily become large compared to the ion sound speed , despite a relatively weak toroidal field .",
    "numerical resolution is more important in these simulations than for the single fluid models .",
    "the presence of both ion and neutral components introduces additional lengthscales that can be quite disparate , as in the case of low ionization fractions and intermediate strength coupling .",
    "a fourier analysis of the velocity fluctuations associated with the ions and neutrals shows that , as expected , on scales greater than @xmath190 , the ions and neutrals are well coupled with identical power spectra for velocity fluctuation , whereas on scales less than @xmath195 the fluctuations in the neutrals are at a considerably lower amplitude than those in the ions . thus , @xmath195 represents an important lengthscale introduced into two fluid models that must be resolved numerically .    in summary , we expect that the two - fluid effects studied here will be appropriate to a transition region in protostellar or protoplanetary accretion disks between the inner , hot , and fully ionized regions , and the outer , cold , and essentially neutral regions .",
    "our simulations suggest a more stringent criterion for good coupling than that obtained from the linear result of bb .",
    "we find that , while the linear instability is present for coupling frequencies @xmath124 , significant turbulence and angular momentum transport can only occur when coupling frequencies @xmath233 . for weaker coupling ,",
    "the magnetic energies are determined primarily by the ion density .",
    "there are many interesting issues regarding this transition region in a protostellar disk that go beyond the limitations of this initial study . here",
    "we have assumed that both the recombination and ionization timescales are much longer than the orbital period . in real systems , the ion density in structures such as the ion filaments may be limited by recombination . on the other hand , at the interface between weak and strong coupling , increasing the ionization fraction increases the efficiency of magnetic coupling , which in turn increases the level of turbulent heating thus raising the ionizational level yet higher .",
    "investigating stability issues such as these , as well as the global structure and dynamics of weakly coupled disks , are fruitful areas for future research .",
    "we thank steven balbus for valuable discussions , and omer blaes and mordecai - mark mac low for comments on the manuscript .",
