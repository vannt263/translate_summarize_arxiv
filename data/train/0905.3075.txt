    "in the two previous papers of this series ( dogiel 2009ab ) we presented arguments in favor of the injection of subrelativistic protons by star accretion on the central black hole .",
    "we showed that this process might explain the origin of hot plasma in the galactic center and could produce a flux de - excitation gamma - ray lines and non - thermal x - ray emission observed by _",
    "suzaku _ in the range 14 to 40 kev @xcite .",
    "below we analyze the origin of the 6.4 kev emission from molecular clouds in the galactic center ( gc ) which may also be generated by these subrelativistic protons .",
    "one of the first observations of x - ray emission from molecular clouds was performed by @xcite who found a flux of x - rays from compact sources in the gc .",
    "they assumed that a large portion of this flux arises from thomson scattering ( reflection ) by dense molecular clouds which are irradiated by a nearby x - ray source , e.g. , by a flux from the central supermassive black hole , which was active in the recent past ( @xmath1 years ago ) but is almost unseen at present .",
    "they predicted also a bright fluorescent k@xmath2 line in the scattered spectrum of the clouds due to the k - absorption of photons with energies @xmath3 kev .",
    "this line was discovered then with the asca telescope from the molecular cloud sgr b2 @xcite and from sgr c @xcite . later on 6.4 kev emission was discovered also in other molecular clouds ( @xcite ) . in subsequent publications based on observations with _",
    "@xcite and _ suzaku _ @xcite arguments were presented that the sgr b2 and sgr c clouds are , indeed , x - ray reflection nebulas ( xrns ) irradiated by sgr a@xmath4 which was x - ray bright 300 years ago .",
    "@xcite analyzing intensities of 6.4 kev line emissions measured by _",
    "chandra _ from the giant molecular clouds in the gc region : sgr b2 , sgr c , and m0.11 - 0.08 , obtained the luminosity history of the galactic nuclei sgr a@xmath0 during the last 500 years .",
    "they concluded that sgr a@xmath0 was as luminous as @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 a few hundreds years ago , and has dimmed gradually since then .",
    "@xcite provided theoretical treatments of continuum and line emission from molecular clouds exposed by external sources .",
    "they showed that a short time variability was the key to investigate the nature of radiating sources from the shape and time variations of the 6.4 kev line . since the light crossing time of sgr b2 is about 30 years , they predicted a decline of the 6.4 kev line flux by a factor of 2 for the period of 10 years .    using archival data of _ asca _ , _ bepposax _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm _ observatories @xcite found no significant variability of the line flux from sgr b2 during the period 1993 - 2001 .",
    "the constancy of the line flux meant that the luminosity of sgr a@xmath0 remained approximately constant for more than 10 years a few hundred years ago , while the fact that other molecular clouds in the gc region also shined in the 6.4 kev line indicated that the entire period of activity lasted much longer than 10 years .",
    "very recently @xcite and @xcite presented new _",
    "suzaku _ data which , in combination with _",
    "asca , xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ data , showed a time - variability of the 6.4 kev line emission from sgr b2 .",
    "it was concluded from a cross - correlation between the x - ray telescopes which measured this flux during different periods of time that this line exhibited a brightest peak in 2000 but fell down to 60% of the peak in 2005 .    since in the framework of xrn model the 6.4 kev line emission and",
    "the reflected continuum fluxes from molecular clouds are generated by the same primary x - ray radiation from an external source one expects a time - correlation between these fluxes .",
    "however , integral observations indicate that the continuum @xmath7 kev flux was constant within 25% during @xmath8 @xcite . however , 6 year monitoring of the sgr b2 region by _ integral _",
    "@xcite gave evidence that a continuum flux from there in the range 20 - 40 kev was also time - variable with a decrease of more than 30% .",
    "recently @xcite found 6.4 kev emission in the direction of the source of tev gamma - rays ( hess j1745 - 303 ) .",
    "this source is supposed to be a complex of molecular gas .",
    "@xcite showed that the tev gamma - ray emission is most probably produced by a flux of high energy protons . from the spectral analysis",
    "it was concluded that this complex might also be an xrn source irradiated by sgr a@xmath0 or the nearby snr g359.1 - 05 .",
    "if this molecular cloud is filled with high energy charged protons , as follows from the hess data , then the question is whether these particles can also generate emission of the iron line from this cloud .",
    "we have reasons to assume that sgr a@xmath0 produces high energy protons not only in the tev energy range but also in the gev ( see @xcite ) and the mev ( see @xcite ) ranges . if so , then the xrn interpretation can not be considered as unique and others are also possible , especially as some results of observations of the 6.4 kev line emission from clouds do not fall into the xrn model , that can not be completely ignored .",
    "thus , @xcite presented their measurements of the 6.4 kev line from the gc made with _",
    "xmm - newton_. they measured this emission from several molecular complexes situated at distances of 30 pc to 115 pc from sgr a@xmath4 and found that their surface brightness did not differ very much despite of their different distances from sgr a@xmath0 , though one could expect that more distant filaments should be dimmer at least by a factor of ten if they are xrns .",
    "a key characteristic of the xrn model is a pronounced k - absorption edge at 7.1 kev in clouds .",
    "however , the _ xmm - newton _ measurements are completely consistent with interstellar absorption only and do not show a significant absorption from clouds .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the origin of the k@xmath2 fluorescent line in the galaxy is its excitation by subrelativistic charged particles , i.e. electrons or protons ( see @xcite ) .",
    "below we define this model as sources of x - rays emitted by charged particles ( xecp ) .",
    "we derive characteristics of the line and continuum emission from the clouds sgr b2 and the source hess j1745 - 303 assuming that this emission is generated by a flux of protons produced by sgr a@xmath0 from star accretion onto the central black hole .",
    "the medium parameters near the gc are quite uncertain .",
    "even the total mass of the most massive cloud sgr b is poorly known . the estimated mass in the 42 pc diameter ranges from @xmath9 to @xmath10 m@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the cloud optical depth to thomson scattering of x - ray photons ( @xmath12 ) , where @xmath13 is the number density of gas and @xmath14 is the cloud radius , is estimated to have the value @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the total mass of the complex hess j1745 - 303 is estimated by the value @xmath16 m@xmath11 @xcite . in table [ bamba ] taken from @xcite",
    "we present the total gas mass , the angular and linear sizes of region emitting the 6.4 kev line and the projection distances from sgr a@xmath4 for these two clouds .",
    ".characteristics of molecular clouds . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ x_clouds ]    from a comparison of the calculation results with the data for the clouds sgr b2 and hess j1745 - 303 ( see tables [ t6.4 ] , [ bamba1 ] and [ x_clouds ] ) we see their coincidence .",
    "this means that the xecp model of x - ray production by protons inside molecular clouds is reasonable .    the spectrum of bremsstrahlung photons from the cloud sgr b2 as observed from earth is shown in fig .",
    "[ inbr ] .",
    "( 110mm,80mm)aa_xib_b2.eps    we notice that the @xmath17 vacancies and bremsstrahlung emission can also be produced by primary electrons generated by accretion processes and by knock - on electrons generated directly inside clouds by collisions of primary protons with the gas .",
    "however estimates show that the energy of primary electrons is about 50 kev for the used accretion parameters .",
    "therefore , their lifetime is relatively short because of ionization losses .",
    "the contribution of secondary electrons to the total x - ray flux is about three times smaller than that of primary protons @xcite .",
    "our analysis shows that there should a component of nonthermal continuum x - ray emission whose intensity is proportional to the intensity of the 6.4 kev line , and as follows from @xcite the intensity of the 6.7 kev line and nonthermal continuum from the plasma should also correlate with each other .",
    "this conclusion naturally explains the results presented by @xcite who found two components of nonthermal emission from the gc whose intensities are proportional to the fluxes of the 6.7 and 6.4 kev lines , respectively .",
    "both components have the same spectral index , that is not surprising in the framework of xepc model because emission of these components from the hot plasma and the cold gas in the gc is generated by the same flux of protons .",
    "since the total mass of molecular gas in the inner galaxy can be as high as @xmath18 , i.e about one order of magnitude larger than the mass of sgr b2 , then molecular clouds may contribute a significant part of the total hard x - ray flux from the gc .",
    "ionization and heating of molecular clouds in the galactic disk is an old problem ( for reviews on this subject ( see @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "we still do not know the unobserved energetic radiation which maintains the heating and ionization state of the interstellar gas .",
    "hypothetical sources which in principle could deposit significant power into the interstellar gas were considered to be either soft x - rays @xcite or a flux of cosmic rays @xcite in the form of protons with energies @xmath19 mev ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) or in the form of subrelativistic electrons ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "parameters of the molecular gas in the gc are even more specific .",
    "as @xcite noticed the molecular gas in gc is heated up to a temperature higher than in the disk , @xmath20 k .",
    "therefore , a global heating mechanism is needed there to explain the high gas temperature .",
    "@xcite assumed that the processes of 6.4 kev line emission and the gas ionization and heating are produced by low - energy cosmic ray electrons with energies below 1 mev which are completely absorbed by molecular clouds .",
    "the inferred ionization rates @xmath21 of the gc clouds based on the 6.4 kev line measurements range between @xmath22 s@xmath6h@xmath6 and @xmath23 s@xmath6h@xmath6 .",
    "calculations of @xcite showed that the ionization rate @xmath21 of the order of @xmath24 s@xmath6h@xmath6 is high enough in order to heat the molecular gas in the gc up to 200 k.    in the framework of the xecp model the density of subrelativistic protons in the gc is almost uniform within 50 pc that explains : a ) an almost uniform temperature distribution there ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; and b ) a constant surface brightness of the molecular clouds in the gc , which does not differ very much despite of their different distances of molecular clouds from sgr a@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "if the 6.4 kev flux is provided by protons , then in the central region we expect , indeed , a constant emissivity of 6.4 kev line in clouds independently of the distance from sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "we estimate the ionization rate @xmath21 per one atom of h , which can be provided by subrelativistic protons in sgr b2 from the relation    @xmath25    where the ionization cross - section @xmath26 was taken from e.g. @xcite .    as calculations show",
    "the rate of ionization in clouds is strongly nonuniform .",
    "it is very high at a cloud surface , @xmath27 s@xmath6h@xmath6 , but decreases almost to zero at distances @xmath28 pc from the surfaces .",
    "we showed in the paper that :    * from the hess observations it follows that sgr a@xmath0 may be a source of high energy protons which penetrate into molecular clouds .",
    "if the injection spectrum of the protons continues into the mev range , then these protons generate continuous and line x - ray emission from gc ; * for the derived injection rate of protons with energies @xmath29 mev the observed line and continuum emission from hot plasma and molecular gas in the gc is generated by the same protons ; * our model naturally explains the origin of the two components of nonthermal emission observed by _",
    "suzaku _ , which are proportional to the",
    "6.4 and 6.7 kev line fluxes , respectively ; * the observed time - variations of the 6.4 kev flux from molecular clouds are strongly in favor of the xrn model , but they do not exclude simultaneous production of the 6.4 kev line by other processes , e.g. , like this one , especially as some observational results can not be interpreted in the framework of the xrn model ; * it follows from our estimations that molecular clouds may contribute a significant part of the total hard x - ray flux from the gc . *",
    "the width of the 6.4 kev line produced by protons is about several tens of ev , which is about one order of magnitude wider than the natural width expected from that generated by subrelativistic electrons or x - ray reflection .",
    "future observations by _ astro - h sxs _ , whose energy resolution is supposed to be only 7 ev @xcite will be able to measure this parameter and , thus , to resolve the origin of the k@xmath2 line emission from the gc ; * unlike other astrophysical problems , that of the 6.4 kev flux can be solved in the near future because of its fast time - variability .",
    "the 6.4 kev flux from sgr b2 had dropped for the period from 2000 to 2005 to 60% of its maximum value .",
    "if sgr b2 is an xrn source then one expects that this cloud will be almost unseen in several years .",
    "if so , then no explanation is acceptable except the x - ray reflection .",
    "otherwise , the origin of the emission from sgr b2 should be explained by other processes including this one ; * we showed that the density of subrelativistic protons is almost constant in the gc , which explains the constant plasma temperature in this region , @xmath30 kev , as observed by _",
    "suzaku _ and a constant surface brightness of molecular clouds in the gc as observed by _ smm - newton _ , which can not be interpreted in the framework of the xrn model .",
