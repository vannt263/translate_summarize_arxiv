    "it is useful to look at the transitions displayed in fig .",
    "[ basics]a from a different viewpoint : absorption on one of the sidebands causes a drift of the motional energy while carrier absorption , being followed by either cooling or heating emission , causes a diffusion of the energy which in average contributes to heating .",
    "therefore for optimum cooling , absorption on the cooling sideband should be maximized while carrier and heating - sideband absorption should be minimized .",
    "this leads to the principle of eit - cooling .",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , like coherent population trapping or `` dark resonance '' , is a manifestation of quantum interference between atomic transition amplitudes .",
    "a review can be found in @xcite .",
    "eit arises in three- ( or multi- ) level systems and consists in the cancellation of the absorption on one transition induced by simultaneous coherent driving of another transition .",

    ", with ground state @xmath4 , stable or metastable state @xmath37 and excited state @xmath5 .",
    "state @xmath5 has linewidth @xmath38 and is coupled to @xmath4 and @xmath37 by dipole transitions which are laser - excited .",
    "eit arises when the detunings of the two lasers from state @xmath5 are equal : the system evolves into a coherent superposition of @xmath4 and @xmath37 , and light scattering seizes .    in order to use this situation for cooling , the transition @xmath39 ) at detuning @xmath40 above resonance .",
    "then the absorption spectrum on the transition @xmath41 seen by the other ( `` cooling '' ) laser is described by a fano - like profile @xcite which has three characteristic features , see fig .",
    "1a , b : the broad resonance at @xmath42 , the dark resonance ( eit ) at @xmath43 , and the narrow resonance at @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the ac - stark shift created by the coupling laser .    for eit - cooling ,",
    "the laser frequencies are set to the dark resonance condition , @xmath43 .",
    "then , taking into account the harmonic motion , all @xmath46 transitions are cancelled .",
    "furthermore , by choosing a suitable rabi frequency @xmath47 , the spectrum is designed such that the @xmath48 ( red ) sideband corresponds to the maximum of the narrow resonance , whereas the blue sideband falls into the region of the spectrum of small excitation probability , as shown in fig .",
    "1b . the conditions for enhancing the red - sideband absorption while eliminating the carrier is therefore : @xmath49    in summary , due to the eit condition no absorption happens unless the ion is moving , and by adjusting the coupling rabi frequency such that the bright resonance matches the red sideband , absorption accompanied by the loss of one phonon is made much more probable than absorption accompanied by gaining one phonon .",
    "the fact that the diffusion normally caused by @xmath50 becomes independent of the projection of the vibrational mode on the laser direction @xcite .",
    "a calculation starting from the full quantum mechanical master equation @xcite shows that in the lamb - dicke regime and below saturation of the cooling transition , the eit - cooling process can be approximated by the same rate equation discussed above , only that now the appropriate coefficients @xmath19 contain the quantum interference around @xmath51 .",
    "the explicit form of the coefficients is given in @xcite .",
    "[ 3levelsim ] shows the cooling dynamics calculated from a monte - carlo simulation of the master equation and from the rate equation approximation .",
    "eit - cooling shows to be a robust technique even if the system involved deviates from the ideal 3-level scheme .",
    "for example , in the experiments described below , due to non - ideal polarizations of the laser beams , photons were scattered from a fourth level which introduced extra heating . the theoretical cooling limit for this",
    "particular case increases by about a factor of 3 , and the experiment still yielded cooling close the ground state @xcite , see sec .",
    "[ expt ] .",
    "another interesting situation is when the excited state decays through an additional channel into a fourth level from which it has to be repumped with an additional laser .",
    "we studied the example of a single trapped hg@xmath0 ion where the states @xmath52 for eit - cooling are taken to be the @xmath53 and @xmath54 levels , respectively .",
    "the @xmath55 level into which @xmath5 decays with 1/3 probability is pumped out resonantly back to @xmath5 .",
    "our model calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ hgsim ] .",
    "a cooling limit of @xmath56 is achieved which is significantly below the doppler cooling limit of about 20 and which could help to improve the hg@xmath0 single ion frequency standard @xcite .",
    "finally , it would certainly be also interesting to apply eit - cooling in cold - atom experiments , e.g. to rb or cs .",
    "in fact , the outer @xmath57-states of any @xmath58 transition offer a suitable level systems for its implementation .",
    "specifically , we give an estimate for the application of eit - cooling to @xmath59rb atoms in a co@xmath60-laser standing wave dipole trap @xcite .",
    "one main difference to an ion trap are that the trap frequency is generally lower and varies along the laser beam waist .",
    "we assumed a distribution of trap frequencies between 25 and 50  khz , corresponding to the intensity variation over one rayleigh length .",
    "we applied the rate equation model to the @xmath61 3-level system and included resonant repumping from @xmath62 .",
    "the detailed parameters and the calculated results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ dipole ] . according to that estimate",
    "it should be possible to cool to @xmath63 , much below the doppler cooling limit , on a time scale of ms .",
    "it should be remarked that in this case the motional state before cooling may be outside the lamb - dicke regime , such that initially the considerations of sec .",
    "[ cbasics ] do not apply . instead , higher order sidebands , i.e. transitions with @xmath64 have to be taken into account . in the example of fig .",
    "[ dipole ] one finds that the absorption probability for cooling transitions is larger than that for heating transitions for many higher - order sidebands ( over several 100  khz ) , therefore starting outside the lamb - dicke regime does not seem to restrict the application of eit - cooling .",
    "the theoretical background of the method described above has to be modified only slightly to apply it to our experiment with a single trapped ca@xmath0 ion .",
    "we implemented the eit - scheme on the @xmath65 transition , whose zeeman sublevels @xmath66 constitute a four - level system .",
    "we denote these levels by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , see fig .  [ levels ] .",
    "three of the levels , @xmath67 and @xmath69 , together with the @xmath70- and @xmath71-polarized laser beams , form an effective three - level system of the kind considered above @xcite .",
    "the modifications due to the fourth level @xmath72 are discussed in sec .",
    "[ procedure ] .",
    "the ca@xmath0 system seems ideal for the demonstration of the eit - cooling method since in previous experiments we have found very small heating rates @xcite and therefore the cooling results can be measured with high precision .",
    "we will briefly introduce the experimental setup , for details we refer to @xcite .",
    "first we describe all light sources which are necessary for the experiment :    for the s@xmath73p@xmath74 dipole transition at 397  nm , light from a ti : sapphire laser near 793  nm is frequency doubled in a lbo crystal inside a build - up cavity .",
    "up to 5  mw of light near 397  nm are sent to the trap setup through a single mode uv fiber . as displayed in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , we use the beam deflected into @xmath75 order from an acousto - optical modulator ( ao  1 ) driven at 80  mhz for doppler cooling . typically , this radiation is red - detuned from the resonance by 20  mhz .",
    "the two beams for eit - cooling , labeled @xmath70 and @xmath71 , are derived from the uv fiber output as the @xmath76 deflection orders of two further acousto - opical modulators ao  2 and ao  3 driven at 86  mhz and 92  mhz , respectively .",
    "we chose a detuning of @xmath77 75  mhz ( natural linewidth of the transition is 20  mhz ) .",
    "the difference in the ao  2 and 3 drive frequencies compensates for the 12  mhz zeeman splitting of the @xmath67 states in the quantization b - field of 4.4  gauss .",
    "the three output beams are focused onto the single ion in the paul trap from different directions corresponding to their respective polarisations and the orientation of the b - field . for a reproducible and fine tuning of the light intensity (",
    "typically few 10  @xmath78w in a waist of @xmath79 60 @xmath78 m ) the rf - drive power of all ao s is computer - controlled .",
    "the rf - power , and therefore the light beams , can also be switched on and off within a few @xmath78s .",
    "light from a second ti : sapphire laser near 729  nm is used for excitation on the quadrupole transition from the s@xmath74 ground state to the metastable d@xmath80 state ( spontaneous lifetime 1  s ) .",
    "the laser frequency is stabilized to a bandwidth of @xmath81 100  hz using a stable high - finesse optical reference cavity and a pound - drever - hall servo circuit .",
    "the laser frequency can be tuned by an acousto - optical modulator , its intensity is controlled through the rf - drive power . with this laser",
    "we can selectively excite vibrational sidebands of the s@xmath82d@xmath80 transition at a few mhz detuning from the carrier . the relative excitation probability on the first red and the first blue sideband reveals information about the ion s vibrational quantum state as described in sect .  [ t ] .",
    "the light of grating stabilized laser diodes near 866  nm and 854  nm serves to pump the ion out of both metastable d levels .",
    "while the light of the laser at 866  nm is turned on continuously troughout the experiment , the laser at 854  nm is also switched on and off by a computer - controlled acousto - optical modulator .",
    "our ion trap is a 3d - quadrupole paul trap : a ring with inner diameter of 1.4  mm is formed from a mb - wire of 0.2  mm diameter , and two endcaps are made out of sharpened tips of the same material at 1.2  mm distance @xcite .",
    "the ring electrode is driven by @xmath79 650  v radio frequency at 20.9  mhz , while the tips are held near ground potential .",

    "its oscillation frequencies in the trap potential ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) are ( 1.69 , 1.62 , 3.32 )  mhz . additional compensation electrodes , together with a differential voltage applied to the tips , can be used to compensate for stray static electric fields and to shift the ion into the center of the rf - potential .",
    "the average motional quantum number @xmath87 can be measured with high precision using laser excitation of vibrational sidebands , which are spectrally well resolved since the linewidth of the transition , here s@xmath88d@xmath80 , is well below the vibrational frequencies of the trapped ion .",
    "the situation is schematically depicted in fig .  [ dressed ] , where the level scheme obtained for a two - level atom in a harmonic trapping potential is shown together with the carrier ( @xmath89 ) and the first sideband ( @xmath90 ) transitions .",
    "the excitation probabilities @xmath91 and @xmath92 on the @xmath93 to @xmath94 transition ( red sideband ) and the @xmath93 to @xmath95 transition ( blue sideband ) are proportional to @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",

    "thus @xmath87 is directly related to the measured ratio @xmath100 .",

    "our cooling results will be specified either as @xmath87 or by the zero - phonon occupation @xmath102 for the three trap vibrational modes .    one way to determine the cooling result is to first excite a vibrational sideband at 729  nm and then probe the s@xmath82p@xmath74 transition at 397  nm ( shelving method ) @xcite .",
    "if sideband excitation to the d@xmath80 state was successful , no fluorescence is emitted on the s@xmath103d@xmath80 transition , whereas in the other case we observe many scattered photons .",

    "<S> a novel method of ground state laser cooling of trapped atoms utilizes the absorption profile of a three ( or multi- ) level system which is tailored by a quantum interference . with cooling rates comparable to conventional sideband cooling , lower final temperatures may be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> the method was experimentally implemented to cool a single ca@xmath0 ion to its vibrational ground state . since a broad band of vibrational frequencies </S>",
    "<S> can be cooled simultaneously , the technique will be particularly useful for the cooling of larger ion strings , thereby being of great practical importance for initializing a quantum register based on trapped ions . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss its application to different level schemes and for ground state cooling of neutral atoms trapped by a far detuned standing wave laser field .    2 </S>"
