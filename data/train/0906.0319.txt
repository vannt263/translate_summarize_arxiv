    "ultra - short pulses in mode - locked ( ml ) lasers are the topic of extensive research due to their wide range of applications ranging from communications @xcite , to optical clock technology @xcite and even to measurements of the fundamental constants of nature @xcite .",
    "although ml lasers have been studied for many years @xcite it is only recently that researchers have begun to fully understand and explore their complicated dynamics .",
    "here we discuss pulses associated with a model equation which has both power ( intensity ) and energy saturation .",
    "this equation goes beyond the well - known master equation @xcite which is contained in the limiting case of small power .",
    "the master equation has gain and filtering terms which are saturated by energy ; there is an additional nonlinear gain / loss term which grows with power ( intensity ) . on the other hand ,",
    "this model critically differs by having the loss term saturated by power ( intensity ) .",
    "we show below that this equation admits soliton strings , including anti - symmetric bi - soliton states , in both the anomalous and normal regimes and these modes can mode - lock from initial states under evolution , i.e. we find these soliton states to be attractors .",
    "these results are consistent with observations from recent experiments in both the anomalous @xcite and normal @xcite regimes where in the latter case higher - order anti - symmetric solitons ( or bi - solitons ) were observed .",
    "a simplified equation without gain / loss terms which is sometimes used to model ultrashort pulses in mode - locked ( ml ) lasers is the `` classical '' nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation . the nls equation in the anomalous regime exhibits both fundamental and high - order soliton solutions .",
    "while the fundamental solutions ( single solitons ) are stationary the higher states exhibit nontrivial evolution . in the normal regime the nls equation does not have localized decaying solutions .",
    "indeed , the nls equation has only dark solitons , namely states that do not decay at infinity but form on a nontrivial background . on the other hand to properly describe ml lasers , in addition to chromatic dispersion and kerr nonlinearity ( self - phase modulation ) , saturable gain , filtering and intensity discrimination should be taken into account . in this regard , the so - called master equation",
    "@xcite is an important extension of the nls equation modified accordingly to contain gain and filtering saturated by energy ( the time integral of the pulse power ) , while there is an additional ( sign dependent ) cubic nonlinear term that takes into account additional gain / loss .",
    "the master equation has only a small parameter regime where mode - locking to stable soliton states occurs @xcite ; it has not been shown to support higher - order states .",
    "in fact , for certain values of the parameters this equation exhibits a range of phenomena including : mode - locking evolution , pulses which disperse into radiation , and some whose amplitude grows rapidly @xcite . in the latter case , if the nonlinear gain is too high , the linear attenuation terms are unable to prevent the pulse from blowing up , suggesting the breakdown of the master mode - locking model @xcite .",
    "thus an improved model is desirable .",
    "if the pulse energy is taken to be constant the master equation reduces to a cubic nonlinear ginzburg - landau ( gl ) type system .",
    "such gl systems in the anomalous regime have been found to support steady high - order soliton solutions @xcite ; they also contain a wide range of solutions including unstable , chaotic and quasi - periodic states and even blow - up can occur .",
    "furthermore , soliton interaction within the framework of such gl systems is complicated .",
    "it is found @xcite that both in - phase and anti - phase high - order soliton states are either unstable or weakly stable . in either case",
    "these states are not attractors @xcite .",
    "hence they do not correspond to observations of higher order soliton states in a ml laser system which has discrete , nearly fixed separations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these gl equations do not exhibit stable pulses in the normal regime @xcite .",
    "the distributive both power ( intensity ) and energy saturation model which we refer to as the power - energy saturation ( pes ) equation is given in nondimensional form as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the slowly varying electromagnetic pulse envelope , @xmath2 is the pulse energy , @xmath3 is the instantaneous pulse power and the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are all positive , real constants .",
    "the dispersion is represented by @xmath9 , which is taken to either be constant ( @xmath10 corresponds to the anomalous regime while @xmath11 represents normal ) or a dispersion - managed system ( see section [ dm.section ] ) .",
    "the dimensionless nonlinear coefficient will be taken to be unity ( @xmath12 ) in the first part of the article and varying between zero and one in the dispersion - managed case , as holds in many experiments @xcite .",
    "the first term on the right hand side represents gain - saturated by energy , the second is spectral filtering - saturated by energy and the third is loss saturated by power ( intensity ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath7 , @xmath8 are related to the saturation energy and power respectively . if we expand the denominator of the loss term in a taylor series in the limit of small power and keep only the first two terms , we reduce to the master - equation ! furthermore , if one expands the power saturation term in eq .",
    "( [ pes ] ) and keep higher order nonlinearities ( e.g. fifth order nonlinearities ) higher nonlinear gl systems result .",
    "the energy and power saturation terms in eq .",
    "( [ pes ] ) are essentially the simplest such forms ( inversely linear in their saturation effects ) .",
    "this type of power saturated loss has been used in lumped models to describe experimental ml pulses @xcite and is widely used as a saturable loss model ( e.g. semiconductor saturable loss mirrors  sesams ) . in @xcite",
    "the distributive model was employed to show that single soliton states model - lock over a large region of parameter space .",
    "more recently it was shown @xcite that dispersion - managed models with power ( intensity)-energy saturation are in good agreement with experimental results in mode - locked ti : sapphire lasers .",
    "it is therefore important to study the above distributed model .",
    "dimensional values associated with a typical ti : sapphire laser system are @xcite : @xmath13 is the group velocity dispersion , @xmath14 the nonlinear coefficient @xmath15 the characteristic power , @xmath16 the characteristic energy , @xmath17 the corresponding characteristic - nonlinear length ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 the characteristic time , @xmath20 the dimensional gain , @xmath21 the dimensional distributive saturable loss parameter , @xmath22 thz the frequency cutoff , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the saturated energy and power , respectively .",
    "hence : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "these dimensional values lead to phenomena which are consistent with the results presented in this article .",
    "the effects of energy and power saturation are crucial in both the anomalous and normal regimes . from ml laser behavior ,",
    "the gain and filtering mechanisms are related to the energy of the pulse , while the loss is related to the power ( intensity ) of the pulse .",
    "indeed , passive mode - locking generally utilizes saturable absorbers which are modeled here by a distributive loss term saturated with power .    in the constant anomalous regime",
    "@xmath30 the saturation terms help localize an intense pulse preventing it from reaching a singular state ; i.e.  infinite \" energy or a blow - up in amplitude does not result .",
    "indeed , if blow - up were to occur that would mean that both the amplitude and the energy of the pulse are large , hence , the perturbing effects are very small thus reducing eq .",
    "( [ pes ] ) to the unperturbed nls equation , which admits a stable , finite solution .",
    "in addition , when localization occurs , the perturbing effects are small essentially reducing the equation to the unperturbed nls equation .",
    "indeed , it has been shown @xcite that when mode - locking occurs the resulting individual pulses are essentially solitons of the unperturbed nls equation ; the perturbing influence of these terms yields the mode - locking mechanism .    in the constant normal regime @xmath31 ,",
    "three regimes are observed @xcite : ( a ) when the loss is much greater than the gain the pulse decays to zero , ( b ) when the loss is again the prominent effect but sufficient gain exists in the system to sustain a very slowly decaying evolution resulting in a `` quasi - soliton '' state and ( c ) the soliton regime above a certain value of gain .",
    "this soliton differs from its anomalous dispersion counterpart in that it does not obey the unperturbed nls equation , it is much wider and strongly chirped .",
    "for example in fig .",
    "[ single.fig ] a soliton mode is depicted which evolves from a unit gaussian state in the anomalous ( @xmath32 ) and normal ( @xmath33 ) regimes ( here @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the anomalous case , @xmath37 in the normal case )     are depicted below each evolution . for the normal regime",

    "solitons are obtained when the gain is above a certain critical value , @xmath39 , otherwise pulses dissipate and eventually vanish @xcite .",
    "as gain becomes stronger additional soliton states are possible and 2 , 3 , 4 or more coupled pulses are found to be supported .",
    "here we set @xmath34 , @xmath35 and vary the gain parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the value of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the pulse separation and pulse width respectively , is an important parameter .",

    "the resulting individual pulses are similar to the single soliton mode - locking case @xcite , i.e. individual pulses are approximately solutions of the unperturbed nls equation , namely hyperbolic secants .",
    "the pulses differ from a single soliton in that the individual pulse energy is smaller then that observed for the single soliton mode - locking case for the same choice of @xmath4 , while the total energy of the two soliton state is higher .",
    "this is due to the non - locality of energy saturation in the gain and filtering terms .    to investigate the minimum distance , @xmath49 , between the solitons in order for no interactions to occur we evolve equation starting with two solitons .",
    "if the initial two pulses are sufficiently far apart then the propagation evolves to a two soliton state and the resulting pulses have a constant phase difference .",
    "if the distance between them is less than a critical value then the two pulses interact in a way characterized by the difference in phase between the peaks amplitudes : @xmath44 .",

    "( [ pes ] ) .",
    "when the initial conditions are anti - symmetric ( out of phase by @xmath50 ) then they repel each other until their separation is above this critical distance while retaining the difference in phase , resulting in an effective two pulse high - order soliton state .",
