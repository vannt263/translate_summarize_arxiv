    "the @xmath0 sigma model have been investigated in detail since the early 70 s mainly as toy models to explore the strong coupling effects of @xmath1 and as effective models of some condensed matter systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "an important issue related to this type of models concern the existence of soliton type solutions . for the simplest @xmath2 mode",
    "topological solutions have been shown to exist@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the solutions are of arbitrary size due to scale invariance .",
    "as argued originally by dzyaloshinsky , polyakov and wiegmann@xcite a chern - simons term can naturally arise in this type of models and the presence of a dimensional parameter could play some role stabilizing the soliton solutions .",
    "a first detailed consideration of this problem was done in ref.@xcite where a perturbative analysis around the scale invariant solutions ( i.e no chern simons coupling @xmath3 ) showed that the solutions were pushed to infinite size .",
    "the problem of the stabilizing topological soliton of the pure @xmath2 model by including a chern - simons and maxwell term for the gauge field , was done by nonperturbative analysis in ref.z , ta , tay , ls , ls1,ls2 .",
    "although , these works showed the possibility of stabilizing the @xmath2 sigma model solitons , they do not present self - duality bogomolnyi equations . this lack of self - duality can present itself as a disadvantage , at least technically .",
    "one reason is that self - dual vortices , such as , for example , those of the abelian higgs model @xcite do not interact by virtue of the stress tensor vanishing identically , and hence multivortex configurations arbitrarily distributed on the plane can be studied systematically .    in the recent years",
    ", theories with nonstandard kinetic term , named @xmath4-field models , have received much attention .",
    "the @xmath4-field models are mainly in connection with effective cosmological models@xcite-@xcite as well as the tachyon matter@xcite , the ghost condensates @xcite-@xcite and dark matterapl .",
    "the addition of non - linear terms to the kinetic part of the lagrangian has interesting consequences for topological defects , making it possible for defects to arise without a symmetry - breaking potential term @xcite . in this context",
    "several studies have been conducted , showing that the @xmath4-theories can support topological soliton solutions both in models of matter as in gauged models@xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "these solitons have certain features such as their characteristic size , which are not necessarily those of the standard models@xcite-@xcite    in this article , we investigate a chern - simons-@xmath2 model with a nonstandard kinetic term .",
    "we will show that introducing a particular nonstandard dynamics in a chern - simons-@xmath2 model , via a function @xmath5 depending on the @xmath2 field , we can obtain self - duality bogomolnyi equations by minimizing the energy functional of the model .",
    "finally , we will be able to solve the bogomolnyi equations and obtain novel analytic expressions for the soliton solutions .",
    "this analysis is completed by showing explicitly the principal features of the soliton profiles .",
    "we begin by considering the following @xmath6-dimensional chern - simons model , coupled to a complex @xmath2 field @xmath7 , subject to the constraint @xmath8 @xmath9where @xmath10 is the chern - simons action , @xmath11here @xmath12 , is electromagnetic strength - tensor , @xmath13 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the metric tensor is defined as @xmath14 .",
    "the potential @xmath15 is a function of the field @xmath16 and its complex conjugate .",
    "the constraint can be introduced in the variational process via a lagrange multiplier .",
    "then , we extremise the following action @xmath17the variation of this action yields the field equations , @xmath18@xmath19where @xmath20 $ ] is the conserved current density and @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 n.\\ ] ]    the time component of eq.([motion ] ) @xmath23is gauss s law of chern - simons dynamics . integrating it over the entire plane one obtains the important consequence that any object with charge @xmath24 also carries magnetic flux",
    "@xmath25 @xcite-@xcite : @xmath26where in the expression of magnetic flux we renamed @xmath27 as @xmath28 .",
    "the expression of the energy functional for the static field configuration is @xmath29    as mentioned in ref.@xcite , the model ( [ s1 ] ) does not support bogomolnyi equations .",
    "in fact , as was shown in the ref.@xcite , it can be established that the energy functional ( [ statich ] ) is bounded below by a multiple of the winding number , which is guaranteed to be a non - vanishing energy for non - trivial field configuration . despite this",
    ", it is not possible to saturate the topological bound .",
    "this is because the nature of the @xmath2 field , which prevents rewrite the expression ( [ statich ] ) as sum of square terms plus a topological term .",
    "we will consider , here , a generalization of the model ( [ s1 ] ) , which consist on a modification of the model ( [ s1 ] ) by introducing a nonstandard kinetic term .",
    "specifically , we consider the following @xmath6 dimensional model with chern - simons - cp(1 ) lagrangian @xmath30here , the function @xmath31 is , in principle , an arbitrary function of the @xmath2 field .    since , we are interested on time - independent soliton solutions that ensure the finiteness of the action ( [ s2 ] )",
