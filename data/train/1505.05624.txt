    "electric and spin transport in three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulators has received a great deal of attention because of the insulators surface dirac fermions with the unique spin texture .",
    "the presence of the spin texture has been confirmed by several experiments employing angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , and a variety of novel transport phenomena have been proposed  @xcite . in real materials , however , unavoidable bulk conduction often hinders surface conduction .",
    "electric transport in 3d topological insulators has been analyzed with the so - called two - carrier model ; i.e. , the parallel conduction of carriers with different mobility  @xcite . within the model ,",
    "the resistivity @xmath4 in a magnetic field @xmath5 is expressed by the equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the charges , densities and mobilities of the carriers . despite its usability ,",
    "the model contains four active parameters , which lead to large errors in most cases .",
    "the errors have not been discussed and their statistical reliability remains unclear .",
    "this is a fundamental issue requiring a more elaborate analysis procedure .    in this article , we report the electric transport of the 3d topological insulator tlbise@xmath0 . the material is known as one of the simplest and most practical materials for the transport studies  @xcite .",
    "two - carrier transport properties were precisely determined by applying a newly developed analysis procedure .",
    "the procedure enables an analysis with two active parameters and with sufficiently small errors .",
    "the magnetotransport properties were well explained accounting for high- and low - mobility electrons in the whole temperature range .",
    "the carrier densities were @xmath13  /@xmath14 and @xmath15  /@xmath14 , which were @xmath16 times the values expected from the surface .",
    "these results indicate that multicarrier conduction originated from the bulk electrons , and the scattering was insensitive to the magnetic field .",
    "the temperature dependence of the hall mobility exhibited a metallic behavior over the whole temperature range , and was explained well by the bloch - grneisen formula .",
    "this indicates that the scattering of the bulk electrons was dominated by acoustic phonons .",
    "it should be noted that analyses proposed in this article allow a precise identification of the two - carrier transport properties and are therefore useful for all other multicarrier systems .",
    "the tlbise@xmath0 sample used in this study was taken from the same batch of ref .  @xcite . as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , a significant variation of the chemical composition was revealed between the starting substances and synthesized crystals ; the variation resulted in the spontaneous electron doping .",
    "the sample , which was synthesized from the starting composition @xmath17 in stoichiometric ratio , corresponded to tl@xmath18bi@xmath19se@xmath20 ( @xmath21 )  @xcite .",
    "electric transport experiments were performed using the conventional six - probe technique down to 2  k with a commercial apparatus ( quantum design ppms ) .",

    "a schematic of the structure revealed by arpes is presented in figure  [ fig4 ]  @xcite .",
    "the figure shows surface dirac fermions and two fermi surfaces of the bulk ; one of the fermi surfaces was around the @xmath75 point and the other around the @xmath76 point .",
    "for the surface dirac fermions , the two - dimensional carrier density @xmath77 was estimated as @xmath78  /@xmath33 , where @xmath79 was the fermi wave number obtained from the arpes spectrum ( figure 2 of ref .",
    "the value of @xmath80 yielded an effective 3d carrier density @xmath81  /@xmath14 , where @xmath25  mm was the sample thickness .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath82 was smaller than the experimental values by five orders of magnitude .",
    "this indicates that the contribution of the dirac fermions to @xmath4 and @xmath26 was negligibly small ; i.e. , the transport properties are attributed to the bulk electrons .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows that the fermi surface around the @xmath75 point has a larger fermi cross section and a larger band mass than that around the @xmath76 point .",
    "these band characters are consistent with the two - carrier model , where the fermi surface around the @xmath75 point yields higher carrier density and lower mobility ; i.e. , higher @xmath9 and lower @xmath11 .",
    "it is also concluded that the minor electrons with carrier density @xmath10 , and mobility @xmath12 can be attributed to the fermi surface around the @xmath76 point .    as discussed above ,",
    "novel surface transport is hidden in bulk metallic conduction with carrier density @xmath83  /@xmath14 .",
    "in contrast , bulk insulating state with carrier density @xmath84  /@xmath14 was demonstrated for tl@xmath18bi@xmath19se@xmath20 ( @xmath85 ) and the surface metallic conduction was distinguished  @xcite .",
    "these results indicate a presence of metal - insulator transition in bulk between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and novel surface transport can be distinguished only in the bulk insulating samples .",
    "revealed by arpes  @xcite . the smaller band curvature around the @xmath75 point results in a larger band mass of electrons . the greater band curvature around the @xmath76 point results in smaller band mass .",
    "the amplitude of the minimum bulk band gap is also presented . ]    finally , we discuss the temperature dependence of scattering realized in the system .",
    "the scattering time is in proportion to the mobility , and the temperature dependence of @xmath88 is thus attributed to the temperature dependence of average scattering time @xmath34 .",
    "note that the agreement with the two - carrier model indicates that the scattering was insensitive to the magnetic field . as discussed above ,",
    "the temperature dependences of @xmath55 and @xmath56 were negligibly small .",
    "these results indicate that @xmath30 can be expressed as @xmath89 using the @xmath55 and @xmath56 values obtained ( see equation  [ eq6 ] ) and that the temperature dependence of @xmath30 can be attributed to @xmath34 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath90 is presented in figure  [ fig5 ] .",

    "@xmath92 is the debye temperature determined in the present transport experiment .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig5 ] , the temperature dependence of @xmath93 agrees well with the formula , which yields @xmath3  k. note that @xmath92 agrees with the debye temperature determined from the specific heat  @xcite .",
    "the result indicates that the scattering was dominated by acoustic phonons .",
    "similar results are often seen for metals of a weakly correlated electron system , indicating that the scattering of bulk electrons is explained by the conventional theory of metals .    .",
