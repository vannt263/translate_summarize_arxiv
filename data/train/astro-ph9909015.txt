    "procyon s internal structure makes it a particularly interesting target for seismological studies .",
    "because models of stars at procyon s position in the hr - diagram have convective envelopes and because we know for the sun that the solar convection zone is responsible for driving its @xmath1-mode oscillations , we do expect to see @xmath1-mode oscillations on procyon .",
    "furthermore , because procyon s convective envelope is very thin , any @xmath2-modes that exist , possibly driven by procyon s convective core , may be observable at the surface , not being completely damped out as they are in the case of the sun with its more extensive convective envelope .",
    "seismology would establish the evolutionary status of procyon a , which could be either in the core hydrogen burning phase , or in the more advanced hydrogen shell burning phase , after the core has been exhausted and is composed purely of helium . in the latter case",
    ", the presence of an exhausted core and a mean molecular weight discontinuity would leave an unmistakable signature on the @xmath1-mode frequency spacings due to the existence of mode bumping where the @xmath2-mode spectrum overlaps ( bumps into ) and perturbs the @xmath1-mode spectrum .",
    "mode bumping affects the spacing between adjacent @xmath1-mode frequencies , and hence , can be discerned from non - bumped @xmath1-modes .",
    "the @xmath2-mode spectrum would , of course , provide even more direct clues as to the exact nature of procyon s core    the procyon binary system consists of an f5 iv - v primary and a white - dwarf secondary in an 40.8 year orbit .",
    "the f5 primary ( procyon a ) is a bright , nearby star with a well determined parallax and astrometric mass . as such",
    ", it presents a unique target for the study of non - radial stellar oscillations . because of the large difference in brightness between the two stars in procyon ,",
    "the orbital parameters have been difficult to measure .",
    "@xcite derived a mass of @xmath3 for procyon a , a mass which was incompatible with astrophysical estimates from stellar interior models @xcite and the spectroscopic . only recently , with improved orbital elements and parallax , and a precise angular scale derived using the cold chronograph ( coco ) at the nasa ir telescope facility ( irtf ) @xcite , has it been possible to redetermine the mass of procyon a @xcite .",
    "the revised mass , about @xmath4 , is now in agreement with the astrophysical mass estimate .",
    "@xcite , stimulated by the song ground - based campaign @xcite to detect oscillations on procyon , made a study of the evolutionary status of procyon a , using up - to - date physical input and the revised procyon a mass . because the song data analysis is not yet complete , only a brief summary of these procyon models was published    however ,",
    "the situation has changed dramatically in the last few weeks , with the successful identification of individual mode frequencies in the giant star @xmath5 uma a by @xcite , using the small telescope on the wire space mission . because procyon is on the wire target list for observations in the near future , theoretical models and their predicted frequencies have become particularly relevant .",
    "we present in this paper a more detailed description of our interior models , and a list of individual @xmath1-mode frequencies for our reference model .",
    "we also include a table of averaged large and small @xmath1-mode spacings and the characteristic @xmath2-mode period spacings for our models .",

    "models for procyon a were calculated using the yale stellar evolution code , in its non - rotating configuration @xcite . these models included the latest opal opacities @xcite , and the opal equation of state @xcite .",

    "the models employed a solar calibrated mixing length , though the main sequence models of procyon a have a very thin surface convection zone and so the structure of these models are largely independent of the mixing length .",
    "none of our models includ the effects of rotation . as procyon",
    "a is not a rapidly rotating star , the structure effects of rotation will be much smaller than the other factors considered in this paper .",
    "rotation likely leads to mixing in stars , and this mixing can supress diffusion in the outer layers of the star @xcite .",
    "this effect is similar to the inclusion of a stellar wind ( which also suppresses diffusion in the outer layers ) , and so a rough estimate of the importance of rotational mixing can be made by comparing the standard case to the no wind case .",
    "the fundamental properties of procyon a are : @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite and an angular diameter of @xmath12mas @xcite which imply @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the central values for the mass , radius and luminosity were adopted for the standard model of procyon a ( see below ) .",
    "the models for procyon a were evolved from the zams until they reached the observed radius . in an iterative procedure ,",
    "the helium abundance was adjusted in the zams model and the model was re - evolved , until the model matched the observed radius and luminosity of procyon a. the starting helium abundance was constrained such that @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , the final surface abundance of @xmath16 was constrained to be within 0.1 dex of the solar value @xmath17 @xcite , to satisfy the observed constraint that the surface abundances of procyon a are near solar @xcite .",
    "models which met all of the above criteria had their pulsation frequencies calculated using guenther s non - radial non - adiabatic stellar pulsation program @xcite .    in total , eight different calibrated models of procyon a were calculated and pulsed ( table [ tab1 ] ) . the standard model ( line 1 in table [ tab1 ] )",

    "we show the large spacing for the standard model and for the subgiant model .",
    "as just described , we see that the irregularities in the large spacings extend to higher frequencies for the subgiant model than the standard model .    the frequencies and characteristic frequency spacings depend on the radius of the star .",
    "to first order , @xmath36 . the radius of procyon a is known to within 1% .",
    "thus , the calculated pulsation frequencies are uncertain at the 1% level due to the error in the radius . in addition",
    ", uncertainties in the modeling of the superadiabatic layer ( in both the evolution and pulsation calculations ) leads to an estimated uncertainty of @xmath37 in the @xmath1-mode frequency calculations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the total error associated with the calculated pulsation frequencies shown in table [ tab1 ] is approximately @xmath38 .",

    ", it is clear that the detection of @xmath2-modes in procyon a would allow one to ( a ) determine its evolutionary status ; and ( b ) determine if appreciable overshoot ( @xmath40 ) is occurring at the edge of the convective core in procyon a , and/or provide an estimate of the interior metallicity of procyon a.",
    "a grid of stellar evolution models for procyon a has been calculated and their pulsation properties investigated .",
    "the grid of models was chosen to examine the effect of varying the physics used to construct the models ( such as the inclusion of overshoot , heavy element diffusion or a stellar wind ) as well as uncertainties in the observed parameters of procyon a ( mass , luminosity , radius and heavy element composition ) .",
    "the properties of these models ( including the average frequency spacing for @xmath1 and @xmath2-modes ) are listed in table [ tab1 ] , while table [ tab2 ] presents a list of individual frequencies for our standard model of procyon a. the predicted @xmath1-mode frequencies are fairly similar for all models , except for the model which uses a lower ( @xmath41 ) mass for procyon a. this model is in the subgiant ( shell hydrogen burning ) phase of evolution , while all other models are on the main sequence",
    ". if procyon a is a main sequence star , the predicted frequency spacings are fairly regular , while mode bumping leads to irregular frequency spacings in the subgiant star .",
    "as the predicted frequencies are relatively insensitive to changes in the input physics , or the assumed mass , radius , luminosity and heavy element abundance of procyon , the detection of @xmath1-modes on procyon a will serve as a robust test of stellar evolution theory .",
    "procyon a is on the wire target list for observations in the near future .",
    "as wire has been successful in detecting individual mode frequencies in the giant star @xmath5 uma a @xcite , it is hoped that the predictions presented here for the pulsation properties of procyon a will soon be tested .",
