    "the scaling theory of localization proposed that all single particle quantum states of an electronic band in two dimensional noninteracting electrons solid are localized for any disorder however week but in three dimensional system there is a critical disorder above which all the states are localized , and below which some states are delocalized @xcite .",
    "the temparature dependence of drude conductivity in two dimensional system which comes from phase breaking time was studied in 2d - anderson model of noninterating electron gas @xcite and 2d metal - insulator transition scenario in the charged trap model @xcite .",
    "numerically at finite temparature it was found logarithmic dependence of temparature of 2d conductivity and @xmath2 dependence to the conductivity correction in 3d , where @xmath3 is phase breaking exponent @xcite .",
    "signature of weak localization correction to resistivity in thin metallic films at low temparatures was seen @xcite .",
    "experimentally conductance fluctuation in quasi - one - dimensional inversion layers in si - mosfets was also observed at low temparatures @xcite .    however , the electron transport mechanism in thin films in the presence of temparature is still unclear specially in weak disorder regime .",
    "the quantum interference effects in these systems play an important role in the study of metal - insulator transition . but",
    "a systematic study showing clear understanding of electron localization in these systems are still remain unfinished .",
    "we address these questions and examine transport behavior of noninteracting electrons in weakly disordered quasi - two dimensional layers or thin films induced by temparature .",
    "our work is planned as in the following . in section 2",
    "we briefly review self consistent theory of localization in disordered thin films .",
    "the systematic derivation of localization length as a function of various parameters , such as film thickness , disorder parameter and temparature is done in this section .",
    "section 3 provides the two dimensional solutions both in insulating and metallic regimes induced by temparature are presented .",
    "the thin film solution both in insulating and metallic regime are discussed in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we draw some conclusion based on our results obtained in the respective sections .",
    "the scaling ideas at the microscopic level , have been supported by the self - consistent theory of localization due to vollhardt and wolfle @xcite @xmath4 .",
    "this theory is very convenient technique to study metal - insulator transition specially to deal with weak disorders . in this theory one",
    "calculates the density response function , which is related to particle - hole pair propagator .",
    "the density fluctuations propagate diffusively due to particle number conservation , with a diffusion constant @xmath5 , which gets strong size and dimension dependent quantum corrections from the vertex in the particle - particle channel .",
    "these corrections are account for the enhanced interference between the time reversed paths and also have the same diffusive character when time - reversal invariance is present .",
    "vw theory was extended by yoshioka , ono and fukuyama @xcite to situations when the time reversal invariance is absent .",
    "it was argued that when the time - reversal invariance is not present the particle - hole and particle - particle channels are not related and one needs two diffusion constants . in this case self - consistent relation of vw",
    "gets replaced by a set of two relations between the diffusion constants of the two channels .",
    "whereas in the absence of time - reversal invariance the two diffusion constants becomes equal and @xmath6 theory explains the situation .",
    "the theory was then extended to thin film of finite thickness in the absence of any field @xcite and in the presence of perpendicular magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the equation for the frequency dependent diffusion constant , @xmath7 incorporating quantum diffusion due to backscattering , can be derived self consistently @xcite to arrive at , @xmath8 where , @xmath9 is disorder strength in terms of fermi energy @xmath10 and the collision time @xmath11 and @xmath12 is fermi wave number .",
    "@xmath13 is bare diffusion constant .",
    "the integration is restricted to momenta smaller than the inverse of the mean free path , @xmath14 .",
    "this equation for @xmath7 gives rise metallic solution when @xmath15 as @xmath16 , is a positive number , whereas insulating solution if @xmath17 , a real positive number .",
    "the backscattering corrections in weak scattering regime for restricted geometries can be calculated systematically using path integral method @xcite .",
    "this method assumes that the classical paths in the presence of randomly placed impurities can be taken as random walks @xcite .",
    "then the quantum corrections are related to the probability of return of the walk to its origin , which is easily obtained by solving the diffusion equation in the desired geometry @xcite . if we denote the coordinate of the film be @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is vector along the plane and @xmath20 is the coordinate along the thickness , one is able to calculate the probability of return , @xmath21 to the point @xmath18 after time @xmath22 , by solving the diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "the boundary condition to be applied is that the current normal to the surfaces of the film vanishes .",
    "the solution for @xmath21 is given by , @xmath23 \\label{prob}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are area and thickness of the film respectively .",
    "@xmath26 is two dimensional wave vector . for self - consistency , @xmath13 is replaced by @xmath7 and incorporating this result one obtains the following equation , @xmath27 for finite size of the system , the lower limit of the integration in equation ( [ s7 ] ) is replaced by @xmath28 .",
    "if we define , @xmath29 and using the following summation formula , @xmath30 and by performing wave vector integration , one can easily able to get integral equation for @xmath31 .",
    "the result is given by , @xmath32\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 which are dimensionless parameters . here",
    "@xmath36 is the elastic mean free path .",
    "this situation is physically relevent at finite temparatures . due to inelastic scattering ,",
    "the electron looses its phase coherence over a distance @xmath37 , the inelastic phase coherence length .",
    "quantum interference effects are believed to be observable only at low temparature @xcite .",
    "the coherence regime can be defined by the condition @xmath38 .",
    "so we replace @xmath39 in this equation by @xmath37 .",
    "this @xmath37 depends upon temparature which can be taken as @xmath40 , where @xmath3 is a parameter depending on scattering mechanism , dimensionality , etc . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constants having the dimensions of length and temparature respectively . to study cross - over from two to three dimensions we need to scale the disorder parameter , @xmath43 such that @xmath44 and @xmath45 where , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are density of states at fermi level at two and three dimensions respectively @xcite .",
    "in this situation , we study metal - insulator transition induced by temparature in two - dimensional as well as in thin films respectively .",
    "we obtain two dimensional insulating solution as @xmath16 and by taking the limit @xmath48 in equation ( [ s18 ] ) and replacing @xmath39 by @xmath49 . in this limit",
    "one can approximate sinh function as exponential and @xmath50 . then solving for @xmath51",
    ", we get @xmath52 the numerator inside the square root of this equation is always positive number for any values of @xmath53 . the solution of @xmath54 as a function of @xmath49 for various values of @xmath53 is shown in fig.[ssc8 ] .",
    "the plots show that as @xmath49 decreases i.e. temparature , @xmath55 increases @xmath54 remains almost stationary for some range of @xmath49 and then @xmath54 increases monotonically ( showing divergence of @xmath54 at different @xmath37 values for different @xmath53s ) as @xmath55 increases .",
    "this provides the signature of metal insulator transition in 2d system induced by @xmath55 for different values of @xmath53 .",
    "the critical values @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be calculated at @xmath58 from equation ( [ ss20 ] ) , and is given by , @xmath59 .",
    "the dotted line is the approximate critical line which separate extended and localized regimes in 2d electron system . then from equation @xmath60 we get real positive solution of @xmath54 only when the denominator is greater than one .",
    "so we get insulating phase as long as , @xmath61     in two dimensional electrons system as a function of @xmath37 for two different values of @xmath53.,width=316 ]    with increasing temparature t , @xmath49 decreases and at a certain critical temparature @xmath62 , this inequality is no longer satisfied and @xmath54 does not have solution .",
    "it happens when the inequality ( [ sss21 ] ) becomes equality giving @xmath62 , @xmath63 where , @xmath64 is a constant .",
    "when @xmath65 , the equation ( [ ss20 ] ) does not have solutions . in another words , metallic solution in two - dimensional case is obtained when @xmath66 in metallic phase we solve for real and positive value of d(0 ) in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "similarly for a fixed temparature one can also obtain these two insulating and metallic phases induced by @xmath43 which can be seen from equation @xmath67 .",
    "in this situation taking @xmath58 we obtain critical disorder , @xmath68 from equation @xmath67 as , @xmath69 .",
    "then we calculate two dimensional zero frequency conductivity , @xmath70 using einstein s relation , @xmath71 as @xmath16 and substituting the value of @xmath68 . the result is @xmath72 = \\sigma_{02}\\left[1-\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_2^c}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath73 is zero frequency drude s conductivity in two dimensional system . thus obviously we get a metal to insulator transition induced by temparature as well as disorder in two - dimensional system .",
    "the critical disorder , which can be defined as the disorder at which phase transition takes place , can be obtained from equation ( [ ss18 ] ) by taking @xmath58 and the critical disorder @xmath68 is given by , @xmath82 the critical disorder is found to be as a function of @xmath77 and @xmath49 .",
    "so for a finite temparature , one can obtain thickness induced delocalization of states in thin films .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath83 as a function of @xmath77 for different values of @xmath84 is shown in fig .",
    "[ sc8 ] ( lower left panel ) separating localized and extended states in the phase diagram . from this figure",
    "one can able to see that as temparature increases , the critical disorder increases and saturates .",
    "since we have a phase transition in this case , it is possible to obtain zero frequency diffusion constant in extended regime .",
    "we can calculate it from equation ( [ s7 ] ) first by taking the limit @xmath16 and then doing the summation and integration respectively . then using equation ( @xmath85 ) we get the following result , @xmath86\\nonumber \\\\ & = & d_0\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_3}{\\lambda_c(\\tilde b,\\tilde l_\\phi)}\\right)^2\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     as a function of @xmath87 for two different values of @xmath37 for fixed value of @xmath88.,width=307 ]",
    "where , the finite thickness zero frequency diffusion constant , @xmath89 is found to be as a function of @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath49 .",
    "we can also get metallic solution only when @xmath90 .",
    "[ sc8 ] ( lower right panel ) shows the solution of @xmath89 with respect to @xmath77 for different values of @xmath49 and fixed @xmath78 . the curves monotonically increases as @xmath77 increases and then starts saturating to some value as @xmath77 increases .",
    "now by straightforward using equation ( [ s21 ] ) and the einstein s relation of conductivity , we can obtain zero frequency conductivity @xmath91 as in the following , @xmath92\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath93 is zero frequency drude s conductivity in three dimensional system .",
    "so clearly in the finite system size , there is a metal - insulator transition driven by temparature , thickness of the film and disorder .",
    "we have extended self - consistent theory of localization due to vollhardt and wlfle to thin films incorporating temperature @xmath55 and studied the role of temparature in metal - insulator transition in 2d and thin layered films .",
    "we analyzed the phase transition when phase relaxation length @xmath49 is finite .    in two dimensions , we found localization length in insulating regime as a function of disorder as well as temparature .",
    "we obtain metal - insulator transition in 2d induced by disorder as well as temparature .",
    "further , we could able to get critical disorder as a function of temparature in 2d system .",
    "we also calculated zero frequency diffusion constant and conductivity in metallic regime . in the case of thin films",
    ", we found a critical disorder which depends on thickness of the film and temparature . in this case",
    "we obtained a transition from insulator to metal driven by thickness and temparature . in insulating regime ,",
    "the localization lengths increases rapidly as a function of thickness as temperature @xmath55 increases for a fixed value of disorder .",
    "but for small @xmath55 , the localization length saturates to some value as we increase thickness .",
    "we calculated the zero frequency conductivity for the disorder smaller than the critical value ( metallic regime ) .",
    "we claim that for non - zero temparature , there is possibility of insulator to metal transition induced by thickness of the film as well as temparature .",
