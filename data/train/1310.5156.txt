    "we consider the problem of reconstructing the shape of a two - dimensional sound - soft acoustic obstacle using far field measurements associated with incident plane waves sent from only one incident direction but at multiple frequencies .",
    "the forward scattering problem can be represented by the following two - dimensional dirichlet boundary value problem @xmath0 = 0,\\label{eq:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the wavenumber , @xmath2 is the total wave and @xmath3 is the scattered wave . here , @xmath4 is the incident plane wave given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the direction of incidence .",
    "the well - posedness of the problem  for each wavenumber @xmath1 is well - known under the assumption that @xmath7 is lipschitz ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , we have the following asymptotic behavior of the scattered field @xmath8 at infinity @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is an analytic function on @xmath12 referred to as the _ far field pattern _ of the scattered field @xmath8 .",
    "the inverse problem we investigate here is _ to reconstruct the obstacle @xmath13 from measured far field patterns @xmath14 , for * one * direction of incidence @xmath15 and multiple wavenumbers @xmath1 in the interval @xmath16 $ ] ( @xmath17)_. here we denote the far field pattern by @xmath18 to emphasize its dependence on the wavenumber @xmath1 .",
    "let us recall some known results concerning this problem .",
    "it has a unique solution if a band of wavenumbers @xmath16 $ ] is used , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "if the measurements correspond to a finite number of frequencies , as we consider in this paper , then the uniqueness of the solution is guaranteed if the lowest frequency is small enough , see , e.g. , @xcite . for local uniqueness at each frequency , we refer to @xcite . if more _ a priori _ information about the obstacle s shape is available , then some global uniqueness results at an arbitrary but fixed frequency have been published . for example , if the obstacles are polygonal , see @xcite and if thes obstacles are nowhere analytic , see @xcite . regarding the stability issue , _ loglog _",
    "stability estimates are given in @xcite and an improved _ log _ stability estimate is shown in @xcite . in the high frequency regime , a conditional asymptotic hlder stability estimate in the part of the boundary @xmath7 , of a convex obstacle @xmath13 , illuminated by the incident plane wave @xmath4 is obtained in @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of using multifrequency data is that it can help to obtain accurate reconstructions without the need for a good initial guess .",
    "let us explain the reasons why we can expect these two features .",
    "the first one is that since the size of the domain in which the inverse problem is uniquely solvable is inversely proportional to the used frequency , the one in which the objective functional has a unique minimum is also inversely proportional to that frequency , as proved in @xcite . due to this fact , if the lowest frequency used is small enough , it is not necessary to start from a good initial guess in solving for its unique minimum .",
    "the second one is related to the fact that , as discussed in @xcite , for each frequency the dimension of the retrievable information is small which is due to the instability of the original problem .",
    "therefore , at each frequency , we only need to choose a relatively small number of unknown parameters in the shape representation , which reduces the instability issue of the reconstruction problem .",
    "the third one is that at high frequencies the problem becomes more stable , i.e.  more details of the obstacle can be reconstructed .",
    "however , there are more local mimima of the objective functional .",
    "using the reconstruction result at a lower frequency helps to avoid getting a false local minimum .",
    "different reconstruction methods using multifrequency data have been proposed in the last two decades or so .",
    "the first type of method is known as frequency - hopping algorithms which use the reconstruction at a frequency as an initial guess at a higher frequency with the hope that this initial guess falls within the convergence domain of the objective functional .",
    "several numerical results , using either simulated data , see e.g.  @xcite , or experimental data , see , e.g.  @xcite , have been demonstrated",
    ". however , convergence of this type of algorithms was only investigated in @xcite for the so - called recursive linearization algorithm ( rla ) proposed in @xcite .",
    "another type of methods using multifrequency / multiwaves data , related to the sampling methods , can be found in @xcite .    inspired by the presentation in @xcite , we define , for each frequency , the observable shape as the one which is described by finitely many modes and produces a far field pattern close to the measured one .",
    "our goal then is to reconstruct the observable shape at the highest available frequency @xmath19 .",
    "the link between this observable shape and the true one is related to the stability issue , see @xcite and section [ discussion ] for more explanation . to achieve this goal",
    ", we proceed as follows .    *",
    "first , we propose a projected recursive newton method for solving this inverse problem . the idea is to use a certain number of newton iterations at each frequency , starting from the lowest one , and then the reconstruction is used to linearize the problem at the next higher frequency .",
    "we prove the convergence rate of this algorithm , see section [ sec : rla ] , which shows a significant improvement compared to the linear convergence rate of the rla obtained in @xcite .",
    "we investigate both noiseless and noisy data . *",
    "second , a multi - level newton method is proposed and its convergence rate is also investigated . the main idea of this method is to divide the whole frequency set into subsets and each of them are treated using the recursive newton algorithm of section [ sec : rla ] .",
    "the difference between these two methods is that in multi - level newton method the regularization parameter associated with different frequency subsets can be chosen to be different whereas in the original recursive newton method this parameter is fixed at all frequencies .",
    "this adaptive choice of the regularization parameter allows us to obtain the same convergence rate as the previous algorithm but with less restrictive requirement on the accuracy of the reconstruction at the lowest frequency .",
    "this topic is discussed in section [ sec : mnm ] .",
    "related to this approach , we cite the work @xcite which also investigates a multi - level projected steepest descent method in banach spaces with a discrepancy principle used for stopping the iterative process at each frequency .",
    "finally , we show in section [ sec : num ] some numerical results using simulated data to demonstrate the performance of the aforementioned algorithms .",
    "our numerical results are consistent with the theoretical analysis of sections [ sec : rla ] and [ sec : mnm ] .    concerning the choice of the first guess at the starting frequency as well as the reconstruction accuracy , we refer the reader to section 3 of @xcite .",
    "in this work , we consider the case of star - shaped obstacles whose boundary @xmath7 can be represented by @xmath20\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a given internal point of @xmath13 in @xmath22 and the radial function @xmath23 is positive in @xmath24 $ ] with @xmath25 . in the following ,",

    ", a finite dimensional observable shape basically produces the same measured data as the true one ( up to the noise level ) but usually has a simpler fourier series .",

    "however , we should emphasize that , there may be several finite dimensional observable shapes which are very different from @xmath123 due to the ill - posedness of the considered inverse problem .",
    "the question on how these observable shapes approximate the original one relates closely to the stability of the inverse problem which was discussed in @xcite .    as remarked in @xcite , we made use of the value @xmath113 instead of the noise level @xmath114",
    "because if the latter is used , the finite dimensional observable shapes might not exist",
    ". however , it is possible to choose @xmath113 close to @xmath114 while @xmath112 can still be chosen not too large .",
    "this can be explained using the heisenberg s uncertainty principle in physics on the resolution limit of scattering problems .",
    "it says that , at a fix frequency , we can not observe small details of the scatterer using noisy measurements of the far field pattern , regardless the noise magnitude .",
    "in other words , choosing too many fourier modes does not help to improve the reconstruction accuracy but increases the instability of the reconstruction .",
    "therefore , @xmath112 should not be chosen too large .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this resolution limit is about half of the wavelength for weak penetrable scatterers , see also @xcite . due to this uncertainty principle , we also choose @xmath125 , @xmath82 , in algorithm [ alg:1 ] such that they contain finite numbers of fourier modes .",
    "algorithm [ alg:1 ] requires an approximation @xmath126 of the true radial function at the lowest frequency .",
    "as proved in @xcite , we can only guarantee a `` good '' @xmath126 if the true obstacle @xmath13 is contained in the disk @xmath127 centered at the point @xmath21 and radius @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , we first assume that the unknown obstacle is within a given region and the lowest frequency @xmath129 is chosen so small that this region is contained inside the disk @xmath127 . moreover , in the sequel , we make the following assumptions about the radial functions of the observable shapes :    * assumption 1 * : the radial functions @xmath130 are bounded from below , i.e. , there exists a constant @xmath131 such that @xmath132 where @xmath133 represents the maximum norm .",
    "since the observable shapes , roughly speaking , are approximations of the true one , the assumption ( [ eq : ass1 ] ) requires that the size of the true obstacle is not too small . as indicated in theorem [ the : con1 ] , this lower bound @xmath134 can be chosen comparable to the regularization parameter @xmath135 , see , which is reasonably small .",
    "that means , this assumption is not very restrictive .",
    "* assumption 2 * : there exists a constant @xmath136 such that @xmath137 roughly speaking , this assumption says that the observable shapes of two consecutive frequencies should not be too different . for more details about the validity of assumption 2 , see remark 3 of @xcite .    for the following convergence analysis",

    "indeed , for a given frequency step @xmath94 , we have @xmath261 that means , it is non - increasing when @xmath256 increases if the frequency step is kept fixed .",
    "the other factors of the second term of are clearly non - increasing .",
    "hence , the only factor which could cause the constant @xmath175 to increase is @xmath259 in the first term of .",
    "the question on how this factor @xmath259 depends on the frequency is still open to us .",
    "note however that , based on integral equation methods , precisely the explicit dependence of the norms of the corresponding boundary integral operators in terms of the frequencies , see @xcite for instance , we infer that @xmath259 increases as @xmath256 increases , but at a moderate rate , i.e. polynomially",
    ". then we can eliminate its effect on the constant @xmath175 by increasing the number of newton steps at each frequency .",
    "we will investigate this question in a future work .",
    "in this section , we discuss how to obtain the comparable error estimates as in the previous section but with a less restrictive condition than concerning the reconstruction at the lowest frequency . for this purpose",
    ", we use a multi - level newton method which is described hereafter .",
    "we recall that the error estimate was obtained under the conditions , , and . in this section ,",
    "we choose @xmath262 for simplicity . to make the analysis easier to follow , we rewrite the above conditions here @xmath263d_0c_0\\alpha,\\label{eq33}\\\\   & & \\frac{\\tilde \\delta}{2\\sqrt\\alpha}\\le   \\frac{1}{2 } \\left[1 - \\frac{\\epsilon(2+d_0)}{3}\\right]d_0c_0\\alpha , \\label{eq34}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the constant @xmath219 being given by which depends on @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , in the following , we denote by @xmath264 to indicate this dependence .",
    "we reserve the notations @xmath219 and @xmath135 for the constants in the previous section , i.e.  these constants associate with the full frequency set .",
    "so theorem [ th : con2 ] says that if the conditions  are satisfied , and if the solution @xmath126 at the lowest wavenumber @xmath83 satisfies , i.e. @xmath265 then the final error estimate holds true .",
    "we remark that the regularization parameter @xmath135 depends on the smallest singular value @xmath266 of the domain derivative @xmath267 .",
    "clearly , the more frequencies used , the smaller this singular value @xmath266 is . therefore , by subdividing the original interval of frequencies into sub - intervals and choosing this regularization parameter depending on the smallest singular value in different frequency sub - intervals , we may not need to choose a small regularization parameter ( in other words , with a less restrictive condition on the initial guess ) at the first sub - interval but still obtain a comparable error estimate as .    to make the following analysis consistent with the previous section , we still consider the set of frequencies @xmath268 with step size @xmath94 as in section [ sec : rla ] .",
    "suppose that the original frequency interval @xmath269 is divided into @xmath105 sub - intervals from low to high frequencies .",
    "these sub - intervals do not need to have the same number of frequencies .",
    "we denote by @xmath270 the smallest singular value in the @xmath271-th sub - interval .",
    "that is , @xmath272 here @xmath141 the smallest singular value of @xmath143 as in section [ sec : rla ] .",
    "moreover , we choose the sequence of parameters @xmath273 , as follows : @xmath274 by this choice of the parameters @xmath275 , it is clear that @xmath276 associated with these sub - intervals , we choose the set of regularization parameters @xmath277 , @xmath278 such that is satisfied in each sub - intervals , where @xmath266 is replaced by the corresponding parameter @xmath275 .",

    "* step 2 : for @xmath278 * * choose @xmath277 satisfying and . * * use algorithm [ alg:1 ] to find an approximation in the @xmath271-th frequency sub - interval .",
    "let us show a similar convergence result as in theorem [ th : con2 ] for this algorithm . from and",
    "it can be proved using elementary analysis that @xmath281 we recall that @xmath219 and @xmath135 are associated with the whole frequency interval @xmath269 .",
    "it also follows from and that the inequalities  still hold for the same frequency step @xmath94 and noise level as in theorems [ the : con1 ] and [ th : con2 ] when @xmath135 is replaced by @xmath282 and @xmath219 by @xmath283 .",
    "that means , all the conditions of these theorems are satisfied for each sub - interval .",
    "now we replace the condition in theorems [ the : con1 ] and [ th : con2 ] by the following one for the first sub - interval : @xmath284 hence , from theorem [ th : con2 ] ( see ) we obtain the following error estimate in the first sub - interval @xmath285 \\left[1 -\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon(1+d_0)}{3}\\right)^{j-1}\\frac{\\epsilon(2+d_0)}{3}\\right ] } \\nonumber\\\\    & + &   \\tilde c_1\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon(1+d_0)}{3}\\right)^{j-1 } \\sqrt{\\delta k}.\\nonumber \\\\    & \\le & \\frac{\\tilde \\delta}{2\\sqrt\\alpha \\left [ 1 - \\frac{\\epsilon(1+d_0)}{3 } \\right ] \\left[1 -\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon(1+d_0)}{3}\\right)^{j-1}\\frac{\\epsilon(2+d_0)}{3}\\right ] } \\nonumber\\\\    & + &   \\tilde c_1\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon(1+d_0)}{3}\\right)^{j-1 } \\sqrt{\\delta k}.\\label{eq36}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a constant @xmath286 .",

    "we summarize the above analysis in the following theorem .",
    "[ th : multi ] suppose that the frequency set @xmath291 is subdivided into @xmath105 sub - intervals .",

    "moreover , let @xmath167 be a positive real number satisfying @xmath168 , and @xmath277 , @xmath278 , be the regularization parameters satisfying and .",
    "we also suppose that the frequency step is small enough so that the conditions and are fulfilled for @xmath293 and @xmath294 given by .",
    "then there exists an integer @xmath62 large enough such that if the reconstruction at the lowest frequency satisfies , we have @xmath173 $ ] and the following error estimate holds true @xmath295 for every @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is as in theorem [ th : con2 ] and @xmath286 is a constant independent of @xmath235 , @xmath277 and @xmath95 . here @xmath230 is defined as in .",
    "theorem [ th : multi ] indicates that we still obtain the same error estimate as in theorem [ th : con2 ] with @xmath175 being replaced by @xmath286 .",
    "that means , by using the multi - level algorithm , we can obtain basically the same error estimate as in theorem [ th : con2 ] with the first guess @xmath126 satisfying the condition which is , in general , weaker than due to .",
    "this issue is related to estimating the lower bounds of the singular values @xmath296 .",
    "actually , at each level @xmath271 , @xmath297 , we take the regularization parameter @xmath135 satisfying similar estimate , i.e ( [ eq312 ] ) . in a forthcoming work",
    ", we will investigate the lower bound of @xmath298 in terms of the frequency @xmath299 and the dimension of the corresponding space @xmath75 . with such estimates at hand ,",
    "the regularization parameter @xmath277 can be chosen compared to the known quantities @xmath1 and @xmath92 .",
    "let us finally make some comments on the condition ( [ eq34 ] ) on the noise level . as the frequency becomes high , @xmath135 becomes small and so for the noise level .",
    "however this is quite natural since at high frequencies we expect to reconstruct small details and this makes sense only if the measurements at hand are not so noisy .",
    "in this section , we show some numerical results to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms .",
    "we also compare reconstruction results using these algorithms with the recursive linearization algorithm .    in these tests , we considered flower - shaped obstacles defined by the equation @xmath300 with positive constants @xmath301 , @xmath302 and @xmath303 . the first parameter determines the area of the obstacle , the second one relates to the curvature and the last one determines the number of petals of the `` flower '' .",
    "two obstacles were considered which correspond to two sets of parameters : @xmath304 , @xmath305 and @xmath306 ( obstacle 1 ) , and @xmath304 , @xmath307 and @xmath308 ( obstacle 2 ) .",
    "the measured far field patterns @xmath309 , @xmath310 , used in these tests were simulated as the solution of the forward problem  which was solved by the integral equation method  @xcite .",
    "we used @xmath311 observation directions uniformly distributed on the unit circle .",
    "the same method was also used to calculate the domain derivative of the far field operator .",
    "additive random noise of @xmath312 was added to the computed far field patterns .",
    "our numerical tests in @xcite have indicated that although the regularization parameter @xmath135 must satisfies conditions and in the theoretical analysis , numerical performance seemed to be more optimistic . in our tests , this parameter could be chosen in a wide range , say , from @xmath313 to @xmath314 which still provided good reconstruction results .",
    "therefore , in the following examples , the regularization parameter @xmath135 was chosen to be @xmath315 .",
    "we fixed the direction of incidence to be @xmath316 .",
    "the wavenumbers were chosen between @xmath317 and @xmath318 .",
    "the approximation @xmath126 at the lowest frequency was computed as follows : we first approximated the obstacle by a circle . in this case , the center and radius of the approximating circle were found by minimizing the corresponding least - squares objective functional .",
    "then , three fourier coefficients were chosen to represent @xmath126 .",
    "these parameters were then found by solving again the least - squares minimization problem using the matlab optimization routine _",
    "fmincon_. our results showed that these optimization problems were stable , therefore we did not need a good initial guess .",
    "however , we obtained only an approximation of the low frequency information of the obstacle in this step .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the reconstruction of obstacle 1 using 12 wavenumbers . in figure [ fig:1](a ) , 4 newton iterations at each frequency were used while only 1 newton iteration at each frequency was used in figure [ fig:1](b ) .",
    "we can see that the first one is more accurate than the second one .",
    "we remark that , as pointed out in @xcite , the reconstruction is good in the part of the obstacle illuminated by the incident plane wave but the details of the shadow part is not well reconstructed .    in figure [ fig:2 ]",
    "we depict the reconstruction of obstacle 2 . for this obstacle ,",
    "20 wavenumbers were used in order to reconstruct its small detailed features .",
    "we also can see that using 4 newton iterations improved the accuracy compared to using only 1 iteration .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this improvement is more clear for a smaller number of frequencies or a larger number of newton iterations , see figure [ fig:4 ] for the results of obstacle 2 using 16 wavenumbers .    to see the performance of the multi - level method of section [ sec : mnm ] , we show in figure [ fig:3 ] the reconstruction of the two obstacles .",
    "the reconstruction @xmath126 at the lowest frequency was obtained by just one iteration of the nonlinear least - squares optimization problem . by doing so",
    ", we expected that this should not be as good as in the previous tests .",
    "the regularization parameter @xmath135 at the first frequency step was chosen to be @xmath319 which is 4 times larger than that at the other frequencies .",
    "moreover , 5 iterations were used at the first step and 4 iterations were used at the other frequencies .",
