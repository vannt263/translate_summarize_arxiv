    "[ sec : weights ] , we proposed a method to correctly calculate correlation functions from semiclassical models , exploiting the source function of the resonance and its creation point in space - time as opposed to the creation points of the final - state pions .",
    "this method could be easily applied to generate correlation functions from the event histories of simulations . when using direct pions ,",
    "the creation points of the final - state pions provide all the necessary information for creating correlation functions . by considering the creation points of the resonances that decayed into the final - state pions ,",
    "one is able to coherently account for all space - time points at which the resonance might have decayed by modifying the prescription for generating correlation weights as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : weights ] .",
    "it should be emphasized that the quantum formalism discussed here becomes important only for sources that themselves are quantum - mechanical in nature .",
    "if the source is large and the product of the momentum and spatial uncertainties are large , @xmath136 , the behavior of the correlation function is dominated by the term @xmath137 , which is determined by the points at which the resonance is created .",
    "hence @xmath127 plays little role in the correlation function of the @xmath29 resonance described in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho200 ] when the overall source size is many fermi as is the case for heavy - ion collisions . quantum considerations in resonant decays could play an important role when considering the decay of small sources that push the limits of the uncertainty principle .",
    "however , such sources are also accompanied by questions regarding the quantum nature of the source functions responsible for initial creation of the resonances , i.e. , the smoothness approximation might not be justified . for such problems , unless one knows the off - shell behavior of the source functions as is the case for a thermal model , the quantum treatments presented here address only half the problem .",
