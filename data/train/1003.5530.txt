    "this sensitivity was achieved with a raw exposure of 612 kg - days ( germanium ) showing 2 events which can not be excluded as signal but which could also be background with 23% probability@xcite .",
    "thus , for the next - generation ton - scale experiments , in addition to the already challenging background sources like neutrons also solar neutrinos could become a dangerous background with a rate of several events per ton - year .",
    "coherent neutrino nucleus scattering as a background for dark matter searches was first suggested in @xcite and @xcite , and has been calculated in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the calculations in the present paper extend beyond previously published work by considering calcium tungstate ( cawo@xmath0 ) and sodium iodide ( nai ) as target materials and include all parts of the solar neutrino spectrum ( see sections [ countrate ] and [ solarneutrinos ] ) .",

    "already for the slightly lower energy threshold of 2.89kev , solar neutrinos are leading to @xmath47 events per ton - year . for this",
    "energy threshold experiments using xenon as target material can reach a sensitivity of @xmath53pb for the wimp - nucleon cross section with a confidence level of 90% .",
    "our count rates for xenon are in agreement with @xcite , but our count rates are smaller by a factor of @xmath51 than those of @xcite and higher by a factor of @xmath54 than those of @xcite .      for argon as target material a recoil energy threshold of 8.62kev would lead to @xmath47 solar neutrino events per ton - year . for this energy threshold experiments using argon can reach a sensitivity of @xmath55pb for the wimp - nucleon cross section with a confidence level of 90% .",

    ". however , atmospheric neutrinos have higher energies leading to higher recoil energies .",
    "figure [ fig : atmospheric ] shows , for comparison , the recoil spectra of atmospheric and solar neutrinos for different target materials .",
    "the spectra of atmospheric neutrinos were calculated in an analogous way as for solar neutrinos described in section [ countrate ] .",
    "the flux and energy spectra ( @xmath56mev ) of atmospheric neutrinos ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) were taken from @xcite .",
    "for neutrino energies above 100mev the form factor becomes very small .",
    "thus , for this calculation we took only atmospheric neutrinos with energies below 100mev into account .    at energies @xmath56mev , the flux of atmospheric neutrinos",
    "has an uncertainty of @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the spectra in figure [ fig : atmospheric ] were calculated with the helm form factor of equation ( [ equ : helmff ] ) .",
    "for the present energy thresholds of the dark matter experiments , atmospheric neutrinos lead to @xmath62 events per ton - year @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our results are in agreement with those of @xcite . in @xcite",
    "only calculations for carbon have been included .",
    "they derive a value which is a factor of @xmath63 smaller .",
    "this is due to the much lower number of neutrons in carbon as compared to xenon .    as a consequence ,",
    "atmospheric neutrinos will be a serious background for wimp sensitivities better than @xmath64pb .",
    "this sensitivity can be reached with an exposure of @xmath45 ton - years assuming the energy thresholds mentoined in sections [ cawo4 ] - [ ar ] . to acquire even better sensitivities the recoil spectra of atmospheric and solar neutrinos",
    "would have to be fitted to the measured data .",
    "assuming that for a reasonable fit at least @xmath63 events due to neutrinos are necessary , an exposure of a few @xmath65 ton - years would be required to reach enough statistical data for a spectral fit .",
    "to achieve such high statistics is very challenging .",
    "thus , if the next generation of dark - matter experiments fails to find wimps , the direct detection of wimps might become impossible with the present detection techniques and ideas .",
    "the dama / libra collaboration has been taking a different - in this respect more favourable - route by looking for a characteristic wimp signature , an annular modulation @xcite using a much larger target mass than other direct dark matter experiments .",
    "naturally occurring neutrinos are a dangerous background for direct dark matter searches . to reach sensitivities better than @xmath1pb for the wimp - nucleon cross section ,",
    "the solar neutrino events have to be rejected by cuts with nuclear recoil - energy thresholds of @xmath66kev for calcium tungstate ( if tungsten recoils can be singled out , @xmath67kev otherwise ) , @xmath68kev for germanium , @xmath69kev for xenon , and @xmath70kev for argon as target material .",
    "thus , next - generation experiments like eureca @xcite , supercdms @xcite , ardm @xcite and xenon1 t @xcite should not only focus on a reduction of the present energy thresholds but mainly on the production of large absorber masses .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos become a dangerous background for sensitivities better than @xmath64pb for the wimp - nucleon cross section .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos can not be rejected because it is not possible to select a proper recoil - energy window where their contribution can be neglected without a drastic reduction of the sensitivity for the wimp search .",
    "thus , for sensitivities better than @xmath71pb direct dark matter searches would suffer from neutrinos mimicking wimps . to reach better sensitivities",
    "it would be necessary to fit the recoil spectra of solar and atmospheric neutrinos to the measured data .",
    "such a spectral fit would need high statistics ( we assume at least about 100 events , see section [ atmospheric ] ) and thus an exposure of a few @xmath65 ton - years .",
    "to reach such high exposures with the present techniques in direct dark matter experiments seems too demanding .",
    "however , detectors with , e.g. , _ directional sensitivity _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) could reject solar neutrinos also for low - energy thresholds .",
    "applying such a technique the sensitivity for the wimp - nucleon interaction could be increased for the same exposure .",
    "a promising approach is the confirmation of an annular modulation of the wimp intensity due to the motion of the earth relative to the wimp stream @xcite .",
    "the dama / libra collaboration observes a modulation with the same phase as the expected modulation of the wimp intensity .",
    "according to our calculations , with an exposure of 1.17 ton - years @xcite , there should be @xmath72 solar neutrino events ( if we assume 100% efficiency for the detection of solar neutrinos and a recoil energy between 2 and 6kev without quenching ) within the complete measuring period which corresponds to @xmath73 events per kev , kg , and day .",
    "the amplitude of the measured modulation is @xmath62 events per kev , kg and day .",
    "in addition , and even more important , the phase of the expected modulation of the solar neutrino flux , due to the elliptic orbit of the earth around the sun , is shifted by about half a year compared to the modulation observed by dama / libra .",
    "thus , neutrinos can not be the reason for the measured modulation .",
