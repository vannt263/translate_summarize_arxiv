    "despite the discovery of multiple stellar populations in milky way globular clusters ( gcs ) , they are still dominated by a single old age population with very little variation in the main sequence turnoff age ( e.g. piotto et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this sense",
    "they can still be regarded as simple stellar populations that provide a ` fossil record ' of star cluster formation at the earliest epochs ( see brodie & strader 2006 for a review ) . a key aspect of interpreting this fossil record is the comparison to simulations of gc formation within a cosmological context .",
    "cosmological simulations are now available that model the formation of the two subpopulations of gcs commonly seen around large galaxies . although the two subpopulations are observed to have some similar properties ( e.g. their mass functions and sizes , to first order ) , they also differ strongly in others ( e.g. their metallicity , spatial distribution and kinematics ) .",
    "these differences point to different epochs and/or locations for their formation .",
    "the two subpopulations are commonly denoted by their relative metallicities or colours , i.e. metal - poor / blue and metal - rich / red ( peng et al .",
    "2006 ; usher et al .",
    "the exact division in metallicity varies from galaxy to galaxy . here",
    "we refer to two subpopulations as mpgcs and mrgcs .",
    "in this paper we briefly review predictions for the redshift of formation of these two gc subpopulations in recent cosmological models .",
    "we also summarise the current situation regarding direct age measurements of the milky way s gc subpopulations , and age estimates for extragalactic gcs based on integrated spectra .",
    "we then utilise new spectroscopic metallicities , obtained using the keck telescope , for a large sample of gcs from the sages legacy unifying globulars and galaxies ( sluggs ) survey ( sluggs.swin.edu.au ; brodie et al .",
    "2014 ) and a galaxy mass - metallicity relation that evolves with redshift to estimate the mean formation epoch of gcs in a sample of massive early - type galaxies .",
    "this method provides an alternative approach to estimating the mean ages of the two gc subpopulations .",
    "we take advantage of the fact that large numbers of gc metallicities from integrated spectra are now available from the sluggs survey ( usher et al .",
    "2012 , 2015 ) , and that the mass - metallicity relation is a strong function of redshift ( i.e. formation epoch ) but is rather insensitive to mass for massive galaxies .",
    "one of the first cosmological models to predict the formation epoch of the two gc subpopulations was beasley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . their semi - analytical model formed mpgcs in low mass galaxies and mrgcs in a later gaseous phase",
    "but they needed to truncate the formation of mpgcs at z @xmath1 5 in order to reproduce the ( bimodal ) metallicity distribution observed in present day gc systems .",

    "model , mpgcs also form prior to reionisation at z @xmath5 7 ( ages @xmath5 13.0 gyr ) with reionisation expicitly suppressing any further gc formation until it ended .",
    "after @xmath6 1.5 gyrs , the next generation of gcs that form were metal enriched .    in the cosmological simulations of bekki",
    "et al . ( 2008 ) , gcs form in strong star formation episodes over a large range of redshift . the mean formation epoch of mpgcs is z = 5.7 ( 12.7 gyr ) and z= 4.3 ( 12.3 gyr ) for mrgcs .    griffen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) used the aquarius simulation to resolve the dark matter minihalos which they associated with mpgc formation . in their model",
    ", the formation of mpgc was truncated by ionisation from the first - formed gcs .",
    "they predict mpgc formation to begin around z = 22 ( 13.6 gyr ) and end by z = 13 ( 13.4 gyr ) .",
    "their favoured formation for mrgcs is in gaseous major mergers , which give rise to a broad range of ages , i.e. 713.3 gyrs .",
    "tonini ( 2013 ) modelled the hierarchical assembly of galaxies using a monte carlo technique . in her model",
    "mpgcs form in low mass satellites at z @xmath7 34 ( 11.512.2 gyr ) , with mrgcs forming later in a dissipative phase within the main galaxy at z @xmath7 2 ( 10.4 gyr ) .",
    "both gc subpopulations are imprinted with a metallicity given by the galaxy mass - metallicity relation at that redshift .",
    "the satellites are accreted between redshift 4 and 0 , with the accretion rate based on the millennium cosmological simulation ( springel et al .",
    "if the satellite has mrgcs , they are still relatively metal - poor compared to the larger main galaxy . in the case of gas - rich satellites , some new gcs may form and give rise to an intermediate metallicity gc subpopulation . however , observationally such intermediate metallicity peaks in well - studied gc systems are quite rare ( peng et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "based on the earlier cosmological model of muratov & gnedin ( 2010 ) , li & gnedin ( 2014 ) focused on modelling the gc systems of early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster . in their model gcs form in gas - rich mergers , with early ( minor ) mergers",
    "leading to mostly mpgcs and later ( major ) mergers favouring the formation of mrgcs . like tonini ( 2013 ) ,",
    "the resulting gc metallicities are driven by an evolving galaxy mass - metallicity relation .",
    "thus a single mechanism produces differences in the gc metallicity and age distributions .",
    "they predict mpgcs to form at redshifts z = 46 ( 12.212.8 gyr ) with mrgcs peaking around z = 34 but continuing until z @xmath7 1 ( 7.8 gyr ) .",
    "thus the mrgcs could be from zero up to 5 gyr younger than their mpgc counterparts .",

    "( 2006 ) and spitler et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , corbett moran et al .",
    "( 2014 ) associated mpgcs with rare , overdense peaks which collapse early in the universe . in particular , they modelled the formation of mpgcs in a virgo cluster like environment , finding a formation redshift that best matches the observed distribution of mpgcs around m87 of z @xmath7 9 ( 13.1 gyr ) .",
    "like several other studies , they invoked reionisation to ultimately truncate mpgc formation .",
    "trenti , padoan & jiminez ( 2015 ) have proposed that mpgcs form in the merger of gas - rich dark matter minihalos ( similar to earlier works of bromm & clarke 2002 and boley et al .",
    "these minihalos are later stripped of their dark matter via tidal interactions within the main galaxy halo .",
    "they predict a mean formation redshift for mpgcs of z = 9.3 ( 13.2 gyr ) .",
    "mrgcs are formed later in mergers between minihalos but a prediction for their mean age is not given .",
    "focusing on a milky - way type galaxy in the via lactea ii simulation , katz & ricotti ( 2014 ) found that the mpgcs are dominated by those accreted from satellites but there is also a contribution from mpgcs formed in - situ .",
    "the reverse is true of mrgcs , which mostly form in - situ but have an accreted component . in the case of the milky way",
    ", they predict that over half of the existing gc system was accreted .",
    "their favoured model predicts mpgc formation to occur at z = 712 ( 13.013.4 gyr ) and z @xmath7 2 ( 10.4 gyr ) for the mrgcs , with the bulk of gc accretion at redshifts less than 4 .    as discussed above ,",
    "the various cosmological models make predictions for the formation epoch and therefore the ages of the mpgc and mrgc subpopulations .",
    "next we briefly review the observational studies of gc ages .",
    "determining the absolute age of milky way gcs from their colour magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) has proved problematic over the years due to uncertainties in stellar evolutionary models , intrinsic abundance variations , foreground dust corrections , helium content and the assumed distance .",
    "nevertheless , studies fitting the main sequence turnoff ( msto ) in deep hst cmds have converged on an age for the oldest mpgcs of 12.5 gyr ( vandenberg et al .",
    "2013 ) to 12.8 gyr ( marin - franch et al .",
    "excluding the clearly younger mrgcs that have a different age - metallicity relation and can be associated with accretion events ( forbes & bridges 2010 ) , the mrgcs are either roughly coeval with the mpgcs ( marin - franch et al .",
    "2009 ) or systematically younger by 1.5 gyr with a mean age of 11.0 gyr ( vandenbergh et al .",
    "measuring the age of milky way gcs from the luminosity fading ( i.e. cooling ) sequence of white dwarfs offers an alternative method of obtaining absolute ages that is less sensitive to metallicity than msto - based methods . to date less than half a dozen gcs have published white dwarf cooling track ages .",
    "they include the metal - poor gc m4 for which bedin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) measured an age of 11.6 gyr .",
    "they estimated a measurement error of @xmath8 0.6 gyr but noted that the model uncertainties could be as high as @xmath8 2 gyr .",
    "more recently , hansen et al . (",
    "2013 ) applied this method to two other milky way gcs .",
    "they found a relatively young age of 9.9 @xmath8 0.7 gyr for the metal - rich gc 47 tuc ( ngc 104 ) , which is 2.0 @xmath8 0.5 gyr younger than their metal - poor gc ngc 6397 .",
    "however , also using the cooling sequence method but with different models , garcia - berro et al .",
    "( 2014 ) found an age of 12 gyr with an uncertainty of @xmath6 1 gyr for 47 tuc .",
    "thus the two white dwarf cooling ages for this gc are mutually inconsistent . using an updated metallicity , hansen et al",
    ". noted that the eclipsing binary v69 in 47 tuc has an age of 10.39 @xmath8 0.54 gyr ",
    "this age and uncertainty being consistent with both the hansen et al . and garcia - berro et al .",
    "clearly a larger sample of bulge and halo gcs need to be studied in this way , and modelling differences reduced , before we can make robust general conclusions about the absolute ( or relative ) ages of the two subpopulations of gcs in the milky way using white dwarf cooling tracks .    estimating the relative ages of gcs beyond the local group requires measurements of the integrated light , with the best method being an analysis of high signal - to - noise optical spectra",
    "the situation for extragalactic gcs is summarised in the review by brodie & strader ( 2006 ) , i.e. the bulk of age - dated gcs are very old ( @xmath110 gyr ) with only a small fraction of those observed having young or intermdeiate ages . in the meta - analysis of strader",
    "( 2005 ) it was concluded that the best keck spectra available could not separate the mean ages of the metal - poor and metal - rich gc subpopulations to better than 1 - 2 gyrs .",
    "using spectra from the vlt , puzia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found hints of a slightly younger mean age for metal - rich gcs but noted that the significance of the result needed verification from larger samples .",
    "spectroscopic studies of gcs tend to be dominated by gcs located in the inner regions of galaxies .",
    "the situation regarding the ages of gc subpopulations beyond the local group is largely unchanged since 2005 .",
    "an alternative approach to directly measuring gc ages is to match gc metallicities to the galaxy mass - metallicity relation at different redshifts and hence infer the gc epoch of formation .",
    "a key assumption is that the mean metallicity of a gc subpopulation is determined by the same gas that forms the stars within a galaxy .",
    "indeed , we know that a significant fraction of galaxy stars orginally form in star clusters , which are later disrupted ( lada & lada 2003 ; bastian et al",
    "we can then use the redshift evolution of the galaxy mass - metallicity relation to estimate the formation epoch ( and hence their look - back age , thanks to the era of precision cosmology ) of mrgc and mpgcs .",
    "this method has the advantage of using easier to obtain mean metallicities of extragalactic gcs rather than very challenging direct measurements of their age .",
    "spitler ( 2010 ) used this approach to focus on the mean metallicity of mrgcs compared to those of the host galaxy field stars as a function of galaxy stellar mass ( finding a redshift for mrgc formation of z @xmath7 3.5 ) .",
    "age limits for both mpgc and mrgcs in virgo galaxies were investigated using a similar method by spitler et al .",
    "this work gave wide ranges for the epochs of gc formation , i.e. 2 @xmath0 z @xmath0 4 for mrgcs and 7 @xmath0 z @xmath0 10 for mpgcs .",
    "spitler et al . concluded that mpgcs formed well within the epoch of reionisation .",
    "however , a major limitation of these works is that the gc metallicities were based on observed broad - band colours under the assumption of old ages , and the gc colour to metallicity transformation is known to vary on a galaxy - to - galaxy basis ( usher et al .",
    "if the mean ages are younger than assumed by spitler then the redshift of formation found by spitler is an upper limit .",
    "shapiro et al . ( 2010 ) employed a similar approach to show that the mean ( photometric ) metallicity of mrgcs is consistent with the mass - metallicity relation for z @xmath7 2 star forming turbulent disks .",
    "a better approach is to use mean gc metallicities based on spectroscopy . until recently this was only possible for small samples of gcs and galaxies",
    "however , usher et al .",
    "( 2012 , 2015 ) and pastorello et al .",
    "( 2015 ) have presented spectroscopic metallicities for over 1000 individual extragalactic gcs based on measurements of the calcium triplet ( cat ) lines from the sluggs survey ( brodie et al .",
    "2014 ) . here",
    "we use these measurements to calculate the mean metallicities of the mpgc and mrgc subpopulations for 11 massive ( log m@xmath9 m@xmath10 ) galaxies .",
    "these are then compared to evolving galaxy mass - stellar metallicity relations to determine the associated redshift and hence the mean formation epoch of the gc subpopulations .",
    "we utilise the fact that the relation is a strong function of redshift but depends only weakly on stellar mass for massive galaxies .    in order to define the mean metallicities of the two gc subpopulations we start with photometry , which has the advantage of being available for large numbers of gcs in a given galaxy .",
    "the photometry of several gc systems were fit using gaussian mixture modelling ( gmm ; muratov & gnedin ( 2010 ) to separate them into two subpopulations in ( g  i ) colour ( see usher et al .",
    "2012 for details ) .",
    "for the subsample of blue and red gcs with spectra and sufficient s / n , individual gc metallicities are obtained from the cat absorption lines using the method outlined in usher et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , i.e. cat indices are transformed into total [ z / h ] metallicities using the single stellar population models of vazdekis et al .",
    "they show good agreement with metallicities from the literature with an rms scatter of @xmath6 0.2 dex . here",
    "we determine the weighted mean [ z / h ] metallicities for these blue and red gc subpopulations of 11 early - type galaxies .",
    "blue gcs are known to reveal a ` blue tilt ' ( i.e. becoming more metal - rich with increasing luminosity ) for masses above a few 10@xmath11 m@xmath10 or m@xmath12 .",
    "the tilt is generally interpreted as due to self - enrichment ( strader & smith 2008 ; bailin & harris 2009 ) .",
    "here we only include those blue gcs less luminous than m@xmath13 .",
    "this exercise removes zero to half a dozen gcs per galaxy and changes the mean metallicity in most cases by less than 0.1 dex .",
    "there is no evidence for a red tilt , so for the red gcs we make no such correction .",
    "the gc data span a large range in galactocentric effective radii ( i.e. from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ) but show only slight negative radial gradients ( pastorello et al .",
    "2015 ) so we make no correction for radial gradients in gc metallicities .    it is possible that our gc mean metallicities could be impacted by biases in our spectroscopic selection . since gc selection is based on the identification of the metallicity - dependent cat feature , low - metallicity gcs may be excluded if the cat absorption lines in their spectra are very weak .",
    "the spectroscopic subsample also has a bias to more luminous gcs than average .",
    "however , pastorello et al . (",
    "2015 ) showed that spectroscopically- and photometrically - identified blue gcs have similar mean metallicities in the five galaxies for which comparable data were available .",
    "for the mrgcs , pastorello et al . found a systematic tendency for the spectroscopic mean metallicity to be lower than the photometric one in a couple of galaxies although this difference is within the error on the mean .    for each galaxy",

    "the uncertainty in the peak values also comes from the gmm fit . for the total stellar mass of the milky way , we assume @xmath23 ( mcmillan 2011 ) .",
    "we note that although the gc metallicities for the milky way and early - type galaxies are derived from different methods ( i.e. cmds vs cat spectra ) , systematic differences in the metallicity scale are less than 0.2 dex ( usher et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the mean mpgc and mrgc metallicities and stellar mass for the 11 early - type galaxies and the milky way are given in table 1 .",
    "we include ngc 4494 but note that it appears to have a trimodal rather than bimodal metallicity distribution ( usher et al .",
    "2012 ) which may explain its very metal - rich mrgc mean metallicity .",
    "our early - type galaxy sample has a mean stellar mass of log m@xmath24 = 11.2 with mean metallicities [ z / h ] of 1.23 @xmath8 0.03 and 0.39 @xmath8 0.02 for the mpgc and mrgc subpopulations respectively .",

    "we find more scatter in the mean metallicity of the mrgcs than for the mpgcs .",
    "we infer a formation epoch for mrgcs of z = 2.9 and hence a mean age of 11.5 gyr .",
    "we expect the contribution of ( slightly younger ) mrgcs formed in satellites and later accreted into the halos of early - type galaxies to be small .",
    "our mrgc mean age is broadly in line with most cosmological model predictions for gc formation .",
    "although we find a younger age than the mean of 12.3 gyr predicted by bekki et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , their simulations suggested that a wide range of mrgc ages are possible . using a similar method for the milky way we find a mean age of 10.7 gyr for the mrgcs .",
    "this is somewhat younger than the mrgcs associated with the bulge of the milky way .",
    "we infer mean ages for the mpgcs to be 12.5 gyr if they all accreted from satellites and 12.8 gyr if they are all formed in - situ within the main host galaxy .",
    "our mpgc mean age limits of 12.512.9 gyr are consistent with predictions from several cosmological models . however , our results disfavour models that predict very early mpgc formation ( ages of @xmath5 13.2 gyr and z @xmath5 9 ) in dark matter minihalos . for the mpgcs of the milky way we infer mean age limits of between 12.212.7 gyr , which is consistent with current observational results",
    "the mpgc mean ages from our work , and milky way observations , suggest that mpgcs continued to form long after the end of reionisation , casting doubt on simulations that invoke reionisation to explain the observed metallicity differences between the two gc subpopulations , or indeed , invoke gcs as the main source of reionisation .",
    "we note that the only cosmological model that is consistent with _ both _ our mpgc and mrgc mean ages is that of li & gnedin ( 2014 ) . in their model",

    "historically it has been very difficult to verify directly an age difference in extragalactic gc subpopulations , and hence whether they formed in independent formation episodes .",

    "<S> we present a novel , observationally - based framework for the formation epochs and sites of globular clusters ( gcs ) in a cosmological context . measuring directly the mean ages of the metal - poor and metal - rich gc subpopulations in our own galaxy , and in other galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> is observationally challenging . here </S>",
    "<S> we apply an alternative approach ulitizing the property that the galaxy mass - metallicity relation is a strong function of redshift ( or look - back age ) but is relatively insensitive to galaxy mass for massive galaxies . assuming that gcs follow galaxy mass - metallicity relations that evolve with redshift , one can estimate the mean formation epochs of the two gc subpopulations by knowing their mean metallicities and the growth in host galaxy mass with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the sluggs survey has measured the spectroscopic metallicities for over 1000 gcs in a dozen massive early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> here we use these measurements , and our new metallicity matching method , to infer a mean age for metal - rich gcs of 11.5 gyr ( z = 2.9 ) and a range of 12.2 to 12.8 gyr ( 4.8 @xmath0 z @xmath0 5.9 ) for the metal - poor gcs , depending on whether they mostly formed in accreted satellites or in - situ within the main host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our values to direct age measurements for milky way gcs and predictions from cosmological models . </S>",
    "<S> our findings suggest that reionisation preceded most gc formation , and that it is unlikely to be the cause of gc bimodal metallicity distributions .    </S>",
