    "<S> the curvature perturbation spectrum @xmath25 at fixed wave number @xmath26 has been measured at 68%cl as @xcite @xmath27 ( planck @xcite reports a similar @xmath28 at @xmath29 . ) similarly , tensor modes have spectrum @xmath30 in terms of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath31 we have @xmath32 using the bicep2 result @xcite @xmath33 gives @xmath34 we remark that there seems to be tension between the bicep value of @xmath0 and the wmap upper limit @xmath35 at 95% , but as discussed in the bicep2 paper , this tension is model - dependent and can be alleviated in some models ( e.g. , with a running spectral index ) . </S>"
