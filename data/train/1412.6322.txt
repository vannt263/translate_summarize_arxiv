    "rare flavour - violating @xmath0 decays , as is the case of those violating lepton flavour conservation @xmath5 , provide a clear evidence for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in the sm , these decays are forbidden due to the gim mechanism  @xcite , and their rates remain extremely small ( below @xmath6 ) when the sm is minimally ( ad - hoc ) extended to incorporate flavour violation in the neutral lepton sector ( neutrino masses and mixings )  @xcite .",
    "sizeable rates for @xmath7 processes reflect the existence of new particles , either coupling with sub - weak strength to the sm particles , or then sufficiently heavy to have escaped direct detection at current high - energy searches . among these feebly",
    "interacting particles , potentially at the origin of @xmath8 decays , are sterile ( gauge - neutral ) fermions , arising in several minimal extensions of the sm , as for instance in those aiming at addressing the origin of neutrino masses and mixings . the existence of sterile states is further supported by current data from neutrino experiments ( gallium  @xcite , reactor  @xcite and accelerator  @xcite anomalies ) .",
    "sterile neutrinos are also a popular solution for the dark matter ( dm ) problem  @xcite , and can potentially alleviate some tensions regarding structure formation observations  @xcite .",
    "( although there is still a tension between the most recent planck results on extra light neutrinos ( relics ) and reactor anomalies , in this work we focus on the rle of ( heavier ) sterile fermions , which are not expected to contribute as light relativistic degrees of freedom  @xcite . )",
    "rare _ charged _ lepton flavour violating ( clfv ) @xmath0 decays have been extensively discussed in the context of sm extensions involving massive ( majorana and/or dirac ) neutrinos  @xcite ; similar studies were carried using an effective theory approach  @xcite , some also exploring a possible complementarity with low - energy clfv searches .",
    "the current bounds on the branching ratios ( brs ) for clfv @xmath0 decays , @xmath9 were established by lep , performing as a @xmath0 factory ; recently , the atlas experiment established new bounds on the corresponding brs , significantly improving the bound for @xmath10 final states : @xmath11    a future circular collider , running in electron - positron mode , fcc - ee ( tlep )  @xcite , will constitute a true high - luminosity @xmath0 factory , with an expected production of @xmath12 @xmath0 bosons ( @xmath13 with the `` crab - waist '' ) , when operating at the @xmath0 mass pole . such large statistics ( above tera-@xmath0 )",
    "will thus allow to better determine the properties of the @xmath0 boson , and to probe new physics ( np ) scenarios through the above clfv processes .",
    "the clean nature of the clfv @xmath1 decays ( only charged leptons - especially muons - in the final state ) implies that the sensitivity to these rare processes is essentially only constrained by the expected luminosity ; one can thus foresee a significant improvement in the experimental sensitivity at fcc - ee to rare clfv @xmath0 decays , for instance , @xmath14 .",
    "revisiting clfv @xmath0 decays in the presence of extra sterile fermions is particularly timely given the present experimental context : not only we have reached an unprecedented precision in the determination of several neutrino oscillation parameters  @xcite , and new bounds on low - energy clfv observables ( for instance meg  @xcite ) , but we are also entering a challenging era , where many ambitious ( post - lhc ) experimental projects are being put forward .",
    "given their rle in a vast array of observables ( see , for instance  @xcite and references therein ) , sterile neutrinos are becoming strong candidates for the physics case of several post - lhc facilities , as is the case of the fcc - ee ( tlep ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that direct searches for ( nearly ) sterile fermions , as right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos , relying on their comparatively long lifetime , have recently been studied in the context of high - luminosity @xmath0-factories like the fcc - ee  @xcite .",
    "the present work focuses on the potential of the fcc - ee to explore the rle of clfv decays of the @xmath0 boson as indirect probes of sterile fermions  @xcite , emphasising the complementarity of these searches with respect to low - energy clfv observables such as @xmath15 and @xmath16 decays and @xmath17 conversion in nuclei .",
    "we consider sm extensions via sterile neutrinos , with a non - negligible mixing to the light ( mostly ) active neutrinos , for a wide range of masses of the sterile mass spectrum .",
    "in particular , we address three scenarios : a simple toy - model extension of the sm with one sterile fermion ( the  3 + 1 model \" ) , and two well motivated frameworks for neutrino mass generation , the @xmath2msm  @xcite and one realisation of the inverse seesaw  @xcite .    our analysis ( conducted for each of the above mentioned scenarios , which are confronted to all observational and experimental constraints , especially those from low - energy clfv observables ) , reveals that sterile neutrinos can indeed give rise to contributions to br(@xmath18 ) within reach of the fcc - ee .",
    "this work is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : zdecays : gen ] we consider the general formulation of the lepton flavour violating ( and lepton flavour conserving ) br(@xmath19 ) in terms of the sterile masses and mixings to the active neutrinos .",
    "we also discuss the experimental prospects . in section  [ sec : constraints ] we motivate this class of extensions and discuss the different observational ( mainly the cosmological ones ) and experimental bounds on sterile states . in the following three sections ,",
    "we describe and discuss in detail the prospects of different extensions of the sm regarding @xmath1 decays at a high - luminosity @xmath0 factory , also addressing the complementarity with respect to other low - energy observables .",
    "in the original formulation of the sm with massless neutrinos and no mixing in the lepton sector , the couplings of the gauge bosons to neutral and charged leptons are strictly flavour conserving , lepton - flavour changing @xmath0 decays being forbidden due to the gim mechanism  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the couplings are flavour universal , so that in the sm one has @xmath21 , @xmath22 , as well as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the weak coupling constant .",
    "these rates remain extremely small even in the case in which the sm is `` ad - hoc''-extended to incorporate three massive and mixing neutrinos  @xcite : @xmath25 let us now consider the extension of the sm via @xmath26 additional sterile neutral ( majorana ) fermions , mixing with the active neutrinos . in the physical lepton ( or mass )",
    "basis , the sm lagrangian is modified as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "as is clear from the above equations , flavour is violated by mixings in both charged and neutral current interactions . denoting by @xmath29 the flavour of the charged leptons , and by @xmath30 the physical neutrino states , the mixing in charged current interactions is parametrized by a rectangular @xmath31 mixing matrix , @xmath32 .",
    "notice that in the case of three neutrino generations , and assuming alignment of the charged lepton s weak and mass basis , @xmath33 corresponds to the ( unitary ) pmns matrix , @xmath34 . for @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) ,",
    "the mixing between the left - handed leptons , which we will subsequently denote by @xmath37 , corresponds to a @xmath38 block of @xmath33 .",
    "one can parametrize the @xmath37 mixing matrix as  @xcite @xmath39 where the matrix @xmath40 encodes the deviation of @xmath41 from unitarity  @xcite , due to the presence of extra fermion states .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the invariant quantity @xmath42 , defined as @xmath43 particularly useful to illustrate the effect of the new active - sterile mixings ( corresponding to a deviation from unitarity of the @xmath37 ) .",
    "as can be seen from above , the mixing in the neutral lepton sector induced by the majorana states also opens the possibility for flavour violation in neutral currents ; this is encoded in a square @xmath44 mixing matrix @xmath45      one of the main features of the sm extended by sterile majorana neutrinos , which mix with the active ones , is thus the possibility of flavour violating @xmath46 interactions ( flavour - changing neutral currents ) , coupling both the left- and right- handed components of the neutral fermions to the @xmath0 boson . together with the charged - current lfv couplings ( @xmath47 ) , these interactions will induce an effective _ charged _ lepton - flavour violating vertex @xmath48 .",
    "we depict the full set of one - loop diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyndiag ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this work we have explored indirect searches for sterile neutrinos at a future circular collider running in the electron positron mode . in particular , we have considered the impact of sterile neutrinos for ( very ) rare clfv @xmath0 decays , which can be probed by the fcc - ee ( tlep ) running close to the @xmath0 mass threshold , with an expected sensitivity to br(@xmath1 ) as low as @xmath49 .",
    "while these rare decays are forbidden in the sm ( and have tiny brs in its ad - hoc extensions where neutrino masses and mixings are put by hand ) , in models where the sm is extended via additional neutral sterile fermions , which have non - negligible mixings with the active ( light ) states , one can have significant contributions to clfv @xmath0 decays .",
    "we have considered here three scenarios with sterile neutrinos : a minimal `` 3 + 1 toy model '' , and two frameworks for neutrino mass generation , the @xmath2msm and the iss . in our analysis",
    "we have conducted a thorough ( numerical ) exploration of the parameter space of the different models : we take into account recent data on neutrino oscillations , as well as numerous experimental and observational constraints on the sterile states . as hinted by early analytical studies , and as a consequence of the common lfv @xmath48 vertex , low - energy clfv observables receiving contributions from @xmath0-mediated penguins impose strong constraints on the sterile neutrino induced br(@xmath50 ) .",
    "the very minimal sterile extension of the sm - the `` 3 + 1 model '' - clearly illustrates the potential of the fcc - ee to probe the sterile neutrino contributions to lfv @xmath0 decays : both br(@xmath51 ) and br(@xmath52 ) are well within reach , especially for sterile masses @xmath53  gev , and for sterile mixing angles @xmath54 .",
    "our analysis further emphasised the underlying synergy between a high - luminosity @xmath0 factory and other dedicated ( low - energy ) facilities : regions in `` 3 + 1 model '' parameter space can be probed via clfv @xmath0 decays at fcc - ee , through clfv low - energy decays ( @xmath55 ) and neutrinoless double beta decays within reach of future dedicated facilities ( the latter especially in the case of an ih light neutrino spectrum ) ; moreover , a high - luminosity @xmath0 factory could probe lfv in the @xmath56 sector , clearly going beyond the reach of low - energy facilities .",
    "similar prospects were found for a ( 3,3 ) inverse seesaw realisation .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath2msm parameter space favoured by a successful generation of the observed bau turns out to be associated to very small values of br(@xmath18 ) , beyond the reach of the fcc - ee .",
    "nevertheless , direct searches for @xmath2msm sterile states can be carried at fcc - ee ( for instance displaced vertices associated to long - lived rh neutrinos  @xcite ) .",
    "we have also considered the violation of lepton flavour universality in @xmath0 decays , as encoded by the quatity @xmath57 .",
    "still , in all the models here considered , the estimated contributions of the sterile fermions to this observable lie beyond experimental reach .",
    "our analysis reveals that sterile neutrinos can indeed give rise to contributions to br(@xmath18 ) within reach of the fcc - ee ; these studies , in parallel with other direct searches , have the potential to integrate the physics case of fcc - ee ( tlep ) .",
    "nevertheless , the results summarised here consisted only of a first theoretical study : a full discussion and estimation of the different backgrounds , accompanied by simulations of the events and the detector(s ) will be required to ascertain whether or not one can indeed have lfv signals above the background .",
    "this will be done in a subsequent work .",
