    "et al_.@xcite thus , like the compounds with m = sr , ba , la , and pr , the  compound exhibits type - ii superconductivity at low temperatures . owing to the fact that  and other mpt@xmath11ge@xmath12 exhibit similar values of the critical temperatures , which range from @xmath19 5 to @xmath20 8 k , one expects a minor role of the filler m element , but a dominating contribution to the superconducting properties from interactions within the pt - ge framework . in natural consequence , it is believed that superconductivity in these skutterudites is most likely mediated by phonons . however , some experimental data on , @xcite indicated possibility of an unconventional character of the electron pairing , as in the superconducting state both the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat @xmath21 and the magnetic field variation of the sommerfeld coefficient exhibit some behavior characteristic for the point - like node superconductivity . for , @xmath22nmr experiments and electronic band structure calculations,@xcite have suggested that the physical properties of this compound may be anisotropic .",

    "<S> transverse - field muon - spin - rotation measurements have been carried out for polycrystalline . the magnetic penetration depth @xmath0 and the superconducting coherence length @xmath1 in the vortex state of this compound </S>",
    "<S> were found to be 112(5 ) nm and 32(2 ) nm , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated the effective mass of the quasiparticles @xmath2 , the superfluid carrier density @xmath3 carriers / m@xmath4 , and the zero - temperature superconducting gap 0.67 mev , corresponding to the ratio : 2@xmath5 = 3.76 . </S>",
    "<S> we found markable difference between the temperature dependence of the vortex state muon - spin relaxation rate zfc- and fc-@xmath6 below the irreversibility temperature @xmath7 2.5 k. linear field dependence of @xmath8 , small ratio @xmath9 , and power law behavior of the temperature dependencies of @xmath10 seem to be consistent with anisotropic superconducting pairing in the compound studied . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of correlation between the superconducting transition temperature and the effective fermi temperature within the uemura classification scheme reveals that  belongs to the same class of exotic superconductors . </S>"
