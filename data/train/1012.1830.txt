    "two - jet ( dijet ) events in high - energy proton - proton ( @xmath3 ) collisions are usually described in the standard model ( sm ) by applying quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) to the scattering of beam - constituent quarks and gluons .",
    "several extensions beyond the sm predict new heavy particles , accessible at lhc energies , that decay into two energetic partons .",
    "such new states may include an excited composite quark @xmath1 , exemplifying quark substructure  @xcite ; an axigluon predicted by chiral color models  @xcite ; a flavour - universal color - octet coloron  @xcite ; or a color - octet techni-@xmath4 meson predicted by models of extended technicolor and topcolor - assisted technicolor  @xcite .",
    "the dijet invariant mass ( @xmath5 ) observable is particularly sensitive to such new objects . at the fermilab tevatron collider ,",
    "1.13  fb@xmath6 of @xmath7 collision data were used to exclude the existence of excited quarks @xmath1 with mass @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this analysis focused on a search for the excited quarks because of the accessible predicted cross section  @xcite  for such particles and the benchmark nature of the model that allows limits on acceptance times cross section to be set for resonant states with intrinsic widths narrower than the experimental resolution .",
    "jets  @xcite were reconstructed in atlas  @xcite using the anti-@xmath9 jet clustering algorithm  @xcite with a size parameter of @xmath10 .",
    "the inputs to this algorithm were 3d topological clusters of calorimeter cells seeded by cells with energy , calibrated at electromagnetic scale , significantly above the measured noise .",
    "jet four - vectors were constructed by performing a four - vector sum over these cell clusters and calibrated by mc - derived @xmath11-dependent and @xmath12-dependent calibration factors .",
    "the dijet mass observable @xmath5 was computed without unfolding jets to hadrons or partons .",
    "events were required to contain at least one primary collision vertex ( defined by at least five reconstructed charged - particle tracks ) and at least two jets after the criteria that the leading jet @xmath13 and the subleading jet @xmath14 are larger than  @xmath15  and @xmath16  respectively .",
    "the events with a poorly measured jet  @xcite of @xmath17  were vetoed to prevent from swapping between the poorly - measured jet and one of the 2 leading jets .",
    "the two leading jets were required to satisfy several quality criteria  @xcite and to lie outside the crack region , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "finally , both jets were required to be within @xmath19 as well as @xmath20 in order to maximize the signal discovery potential illustrated in fig .",

    "six statistical tests of the background - only hypothesis were employed to determine the presence or absence of detectable @xmath5 resonances in this distribution : the bumphunter  @xcite , the jeffreys divergence  @xcite , the kolmogorov - smirnov test , the likelihood , the pearson @xmath30 , and the tailhunter statistic  @xcite .",
    "all these tests were consistent with the conclusion that the fitted parameterization described the observed data distribution well , with @xmath31-values in excess of 51% .",
    "these observations supported the background - only hypothesis . in the absence of any observed discrepancy with the zero - signal hypothesis ,",
    "a bayesian approach was used to set 95% credibility - level ( cl ) upper limits on @xmath32 for hypothetical new particles decaying into dijets with @xmath33 .",
    "the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty were associated with the absolute jet energy scale ( jes ) , the background fit parameters and the integrated luminosity .",
    "the jes uncertainty was quantified as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath34 , with values in the range @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the background determination was taken from the uncertainty on the fit parameters of eqn .",

    "the uncertainty on @xmath32 due to integrated luminosity was estimated to be  @xcite .",
    "all these effects were incorporated as nuisance parameters into the likelihood function and then marginalized by numerically integrating the product of this modified likelihood , the prior in signal cross section , and the priors corresponding to the nuisance parameters to arrive at a modified posterior probability distribution .",
