    "the formulation and derivation of general relativity using a flat metric tensor @xmath0 are well - known from the works of rosen , gupta , kraichnan , feynman , deser , weinberg _ et al .",
    "one can obtain a curved metric @xmath1 by adding the gravitational potential @xmath2 to the flat metric @xmath0 : @xmath3 this framework is useful @xcite , but is it merely formal ?",
    "if general relativity can be _ consistently _ regarded as a special - relativistic theory , then the observable curved metric must satisfy a nontrivial consistency condition in relation to the unobservable flat background metric : the `` causality principle '' says that the curved metric s light cone can not open wider than the flat metric s .",
    "the question of the relation between the cones is complicated somewhat by its gauge - variance .",
    "while the flat spacetime field approach to general relativity has been mature since the 1950s , the question of the consistency of the effective curved metric s null cone with the original flat metric s received surprisingly little attention . in the 1970s van nieuwenhuizen wrote : `` the strategy of particle physicists has been to ignore [ this problem ] for the time being , in the hope that [ it ] will ultimately be resolved in the final theory .",
    "consequently we will not discuss [ it ] any further . ''",
    "@xcite more recently ( since the late 1970s ) , this issue has received more sustained attention @xcite , but the treatments to date have been impaired by unnecessarily strict requirements @xcite or lack of a general and systematic approach @xcite , as we have noted @xcite .",
    "we propose to _ stipulate _ that the gauge be fixed in a way that the proper relation obtains , if possible .",
    "the gauge fixing can be implemented in an action principle using ineffective constraints , whose constraint forces vanish @xcite",
    ". this approach does appear to be possible , because the gauge freedom allows one to choose arbitrarily @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( at least locally ) . increasing @xmath4 stretches the curved metric s null cone along the time axis , so that it becomes narrower , while adjusting @xmath5 controls the tilt of the curved null cone relative to the flat one . stretching alone appears to be enough to satisfy the causality principle , in fact .",
    "the metric is a poor variable choice due to the many off - diagonal terms .",
    "one would like to diagonalize @xmath1 and @xmath0 simultaneously by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath6 but in general that is impossible , because there is not a complete set of eigenvectors on account of the minus sign in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "there are 4 segr types for a real symmetric rank 2 tensor with respect to a lorentzian metric , the several types having different numbers and sorts of eigenvectors @xcite .",
    "we have recently used this technology to classify @xmath1 with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "two types are forbidden by the causality principle .",
    "one type has members that obey the causality principle , but we argue that they can be ignored .",
    "the remaining type has 4 real independent orthogonal eigenvectors , as one would hope . in that case ,",
    "the causality principle is just the requirement that the temporal eigenvalue be no larger than each of the three spatial eigenvalues .    realizing the condition @xmath7 when the gravitational field is weak , while obeying the causality principle , is nontrivial .",
    "the causality principle puts an upper bounding surface on the temporal eigenvalue in terms of the spatial ones , and the surface is _ folded _ , as seen in 2 spatial dimensions in figure [ fig ] .",
    "einstein s equations have second spatial derivatives of @xmath4 ( which is closely related to the temporal eigenvalue ) , so the fold , if not avoided , would imply dirac delta gravitational ` forces ' that make the canonical momenta jump discontinuously . on the other hand , avoiding the fold means excluding @xmath8 ! but why fix the temporal eigenvalue in terms of the spatial eigenvalues at the same point only ( ultralocally ) ? it is enough to do so locally , by admitting derivatives",
    ". when the derivatives are nonzero , the fold is avoided , but as they vanish , the fold is approached .",
    "if such a partial gauge - fixing can be found , then it will facilitate interpreting the einstein equations as describing a special - relativsitic field theory .",
    "in such a theory , one would need to consider the physical situation near the schwarzschild radius rather carefully ."
