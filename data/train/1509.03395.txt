    "collective motion is the ability of large groups of motile agents to move coherently on scales much larger than their individual sizes .",
    "it is encountered at all scales in nature , from macroscopic animal groups , such as bird flocks , fish schools , or sheep herds , down to the cellular scale , where the collective migration of cells  @xcite or bacteria  @xcite is commonly observed . at the subcellular level , in vitro motility assays of actin filaments  @xcite or microtubules  @xcite have shown the spontaneous emergence of large vortices .",
    "collective motion is also observed in ensemble of man - made motile particles such as shaken polar grains  @xcite , colloidal rollers  @xcite , self - propelled droplets  @xcite or assemblies of polymers and molecular motors  @xcite . despite the differences in their propulsion and interaction mechanisms ,",
    "these seemingly very different systems share common macroscopic behaviors that can be captured by minimal physical models .",
    "of particular interest is the emergence of _ directed _ collective motion , which was first addressed in this context in a seminal work by vicsek and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "the vicsek model consists in point particles moving at constant speed and aligning imperfectly with the direction of motion of their neighbors . when the error on the alignment interaction is decreased , or the density of particles increased , a genuine phase transition from a disordered to a symmetry - broken state is observed .",
    "this flocking transition gives rise to an emergent ordered phase , with true long - range polar order even in 2d , where all the particles propel on average along the same direction .",
    "toner and tu showed analytically , using a phenomenological fluctuating hydrodynamic description , how this ordered state , which would be forbidden by the mermin - wagner theorem at equilibrium  @xcite , is stabilized by self - propulsion  @xcite .",
    "the transition to collective motion in the vicsek model has a richer phenomenology than originally thought .",
    "as first pointed out numerically in  @xcite , at the onset of collective motion , translational symmetry is broken as well . in periodic simulation boxes ,",
    "high - density ordered bands of particles move coherently through a low - density disordered background .",
    "the transition between these bands and the homogeneous disordered profile is discontinuous , with metastability and hysteresis loops .",
    "these spatial patterns and the first - order nature of the transition can be encompassed in a wider framework , which describes the emergence to collective motion as a liquid - gas phase separation  @xcite .",
    "the travelling bands result from the phase coexistence between a disordered gas and an ordered polarized liquid .",
    "this framework captures many of the characteristics of the transition , from the scaling of the order parameter to the shape of the phase diagram .",
    "this phase - separation picture is robust to the very details of the propulsion and interaction mechanisms .",
    "more specifically , it has also been quantitatively demonstrated in the active ising model  @xcite in which particles can diffuse in a 2d space but self - propel , and align , only along one axis .",
    "however the specifics of the emergent spatial patterns and the type of phase separation depend on the symmetry of the orientational degrees of freedom .",
    "while the active ising model model shows a bulk phase separation , the vicsek model is akin to an active xy model and is associated with a microphase separation where the coherently moving polar patterns self - organize into smectic structures  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bands_micro ] ) .    in this paper , building on the two prototypical models that are the vicsek model and the active ising model , we provide a comprehensive description of the emergent patterns found at the onset of the flocking transition from a hydrodynamic perspective .",

    "finding such solutions thus reduces to a classical mechanics problem with one degree of freedom . for given values of all the hydrodynamic coefficients , and hence of all underlying microscopic parameters , we find an infinity of solutions , describing both phase and microphase separations , that we fully characterize .",
    "we then show that the same results hold specifically for the hydrodynamic equations explicitly derived for the active ising model  @xcite and for a simplified version of the vicsek model  @xcite .",

    "let us first briefly recall the phenomenology of the vicsek and active ising models .",
    "they are both based on the same two ingredients : self - propulsion and a local alignment rule .",
    "the major differences between the two models are thus the symmetries of the alignment interaction and of the direction of motion .      in the vicsek model",

    "the phase transitions of both models have all the features of a liquid - gas transition , exhibiting metastability and hysteresis close to the transition lines  @xcite .",

    "phase - separated domains are found in the active ising model and periodic `` smectic '' bands in the vicsek model .",
    "understanding the emergence of these three types of solutions will be the focus of the rest of the paper .",
    "a lot of attention has been given in the literature to hydrodynamic equations of flocking models .",
    "two different approaches have been followed , starting from phenomenological equations  @xcite or deriving explicitly coarse - grained equations from a microscopic model  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : existence_cg ] two sets of hydrodynamic equations derived by coarse - graining microscopic models which will be discussed in this paper .",

    "we first consider the equations proposed by bertin _",
    "_ to describe a simplified version of the vicsek model  @xcite , in which one solely considers binary collisions between the particles .",
    "one can then use , assuming molecular chaos , a boltzmann equation formalism to arrive at the following hydrodynamic equations for the density field and a vectorial magnetization field  @xcite @xmath33 the mass - conservation equation   simply describes the advection of the density by the magnetization field .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : bertin - hydro - m ] ) can be seen as a navier - stokes equation complemented by a ginzburg - landau term @xmath34 , stemming from some underlying alignment mechanism , and leading to the emergence of a spontaneous magnetization .",
    "because particles are self - propelled in a given frame of reference , these equations break galilean invariance so that one can have @xmath35 and @xmath36 unlike e.g. in the navier - stokes equation .    in eqs .",

    "the second set of equations , which we refer to as `` ising hydrodynamic equations '' in the following , has been derived to describe the large - scale phenomenology of the active ising model  @xcite . in this case , the dynamics of the density field and the scalar magnetization  corresponding to the ising symmetry  are given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are positive coefficients depending on @xmath46 only and @xmath47 .",

    "( [ eq : bertin - hydro - rho ] ) is here replaced by a partial derivative @xmath49 because , in the active ising model , the density is advected by the magnetization only in the @xmath50-direction .",
    "coarse - grained hydrodynamic equations derived from microscopic models have the advantage of expressing the macroscopic transport coefficients in terms of microscopic quantities ( noise , self - propulsion speed , etc ) .",

    "we refer to these equations as the `` phenomenological hydrodynamic equations '' .",
    "this simplified model is very similar to that first introduced by toner and tu from symmetry considerations  @xcite .",

    "the comparison between the phase - separated regions of the microscopic models and hydrodynamic equations is however more subtle .",
    "we have indeed shown , using the phenomenological hydrodynamic equation  ( [ eq : hydrocc_rho]-[eq : hydrocc_m ] ) , that the coarsening leads , at the hydrodynamic level , to the phase - separated solution .",
    "this is true in the active ising model but not in the vicsek model , which only shows micro - phase separation and thus a coarsening leading to a periodic solution ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bands_micro ] ) .",
    "this difference between microscopic models and hydrodynamic equations is however not surprising since it was recently shown that fluctuations are essential to account for the selection of micro - phase separated profiles in the vicsek model  @xcite .    more precisely , phase - separated and micro - phase - separated solutions are both linearly stable in the hydrodynamic equations for vectorial order parameters . as noise",
    "is added to these equations , though , large bands are destabilized and break in periodic array of finite - size bands , in agreement with what is seen in microscopic simuations of the vicsek model  @xcite .",
    "we can now tentatively put together these results to propose a coarsening process that would lead to the micro - phase separated states seen in the vicsek model .",
    "starting from a profile with many coexisting bands , the coarsening _ at fixed @xmath61 _ would tend to lead to the formation of larger and larger bands .",
    "this coarsening would however be arrested by the fact that the fluctuations in the vicsek model set a maximal size beyond which bands are ( non - linearly ) unstable .",
    "how this size is selected however remains to be determined .",
    "all in all , we have shown in this paper that the hydrodynamic equations describing polar flocking models generically share the same propagative solutions .",
    "we found three types of solutions that are all observed in microscopic models : periodic orbits that describe microphase separation , homoclinic orbits describing solitonic objects and heteroclinic trajectories that correspond to phase separation . only a subset is stable in the hydrodynamic equations , but it still contains the three types of solutions .",
    "the coarsening in the hydrodynamic equations favors the fastest solutions which are also the largest patterns .",
    "it thus leads naturally to the phase - separated solution which controls the phase diagram of the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the same behavior is observed in the microscopic active ising model whereas one can understand the microphase separation of the vicsek model as an arrested coarsening , the largest pattern being non - linearly unstable to the ( giant ) fluctuations of the liquid phase .",

    "while we do not have an analytic solution for the homoclinic profiles , lots of insight on their physics can be gained by studying the limit of small diffusion coefficient @xmath21 .",
