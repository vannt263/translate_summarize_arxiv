    "those characteristics mean that neutrinos are quasi free  particles  or more precisely , they propagate almost unperturbed during the ( eventually large ) time lapse between their production and detection .",
    "so , it is natural to pay attention in neutrinos in the search to find a system combining both isolatedness  and non - time reversal invariance .",
    "the phenomenology of neutrinos is not completely theoretically understood @xcite . actually , the standard model of particle physics and what must extend / replace it are at stake @xcite .",
    "specifically , the phenomenon of _ neutrino oscillation _ ( defined as the dynamic change of flavor ) is a compelling evidence that those particles have masses different from zero , an explicit contradiction with the standard model @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite . the theoretical mechanism explaining neutrino oscillation was first devised by pontecorvo @xcite and @xcite around the 1960s ;",

    "further , there are empirical evidences @xcite as well as theoretical reasons @xcite for the existence of ( at least ) one more neutrino flavor ( besides the three standard flavors ) , called _ sterile neutrino_. presumably , sterile neutrino is a hight - handed particle which mix itself with the other neutrino species and interacts only through gravity  what makes it be a very ghostly particle . from the original proposal to understand unexpected data concerning neutrino oscillation ,",

    "as long as there still are deep open questions about neutrinos , i think it is opportune investigate the possibility that the dynamics of neutrinos can be `` dispersive '' , i.e. , intrinsically non - time reversal invariant  more precisely : that the time evolution of neutrinos is non - time reversal invariant even when they propagate isolately ( in vacuum ) .",

    "to summing up , the effect of non - unitary time evolution in quantum systems can be threefold : _ dissipation / gain _ ( which means variation of system s energy ) , _ impurification _ ( which means time evolution from pure states to mixed states , what is measured by the systems entropy ) and _ decoherence _ ( which happens only to composed systems and was not discussed here ) . in general ,",
    "those phenomena are related to non - time reversal invariance and occur typically in open systems  the environment being the system s partner to the exchanges of matter , energy , momenta and information ( entropy ) .",

    "irreversibility_. nevertheless , the existence of an actual elementary dispersive quantum systems would be remarkable , since for them the non - time reversal invariance ( and the property of the system s entropy be non - decreasing with time ) can not have a statistical meaning .",
    "if one does not forget the essential difference concerning statistical interpretation , it can be useful to think about dispersive quantum systems as the quantum analogs of classical isolated thermodynamical systems ( such as a low density gas in free expansion ) because both can be isolated and non - time reversal invariant .",
    "i glimpse some developments to be done from what was presented here : i ) the characterization of dispersive quantum systems with infinite degrees of freedom;ii ) the study of decoherence in the context of dispersive quantum systems;iii ) improving the modeling of neutrino oscillation.iv ) the building of new models and the search to get , in the laboratory , instances of dispersive quantum systems .",
    "finally , the issue deserves further theoretical as well as experimental researches , if not due to the possibility to describe actual physical systems ( like neutrinos ) , at least because we ignore answers to this simple question : _ if dispersive quantum systems can not exist in nature ( even approximately ) , are there physical principles forbidding them to exist ? _",
