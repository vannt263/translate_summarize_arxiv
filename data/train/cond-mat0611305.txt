    "flows of granular materials are ubiquitous in nature and technology @xcite .",
    "examples are numerous and range from saturn s rings to powder processing . being dissipative and therefore intrinsically far from thermal equilibrium , granular flows exhibit a plethora of pattern forming instabilities @xcite . in spite of a surge of recent interest in granular flows ,",
    "their quantitative modeling remains challenging , and the pattern forming instabilities provide sensitive tests to the models .",
    "this work focuses on the simple model of _ rapid _ granular flows , also referred to as granular gases : large assemblies of inelastically colliding hard spheres @xcite . in the simplest version of this model",
    "the only dissipative effect taken into account is a reduction in the relative normal velocity of the two colliding particles , modeled by the coefficient of normal restitution , see below . under some additional assumptions",
    "a hydrodynamic description of granular gases becomes possible .",
    "the molecular chaos assumption allows for a description in terms of the boltzmann or enskog equations , properly generalized to account for the inelasticity of particle collisions , followed by a systematic derivation of hydrodynamic equations @xcite . for inhomogeneous ( and/or unsteady ) flows hydrodynamics demands scale separation : the mean free path of the particles ( respectively , the mean time between two consecutive collisions ) must be much less than any characteristic length ( respectively , time ) scale that the hydrodynamic theory attempts to describe .",
    "the implications of these conditions can be usually seen only _ a posteriori _ , after the hydrodynamic problem in question is solved , and the hydrodynamic length / time scales are determined .",
    "we will restrict ourselves in this work to nearly elastic collisions and moderate gas densities where , based on previous studies , hydrodynamics is expected to be an accurate leading order theory @xcite .",
    "these assumptions allow for a detailed quantitative study ( and prediction ) of a variety of pattern formation phenomena in granular gases .",
    "one of these phenomena is the phase separation instability , first predicted in ref . @xcite and further investigated in refs .",
    "this instability arises already in a very simple , indeed prototypical setting : a monodisperse granular gas at zero gravity confined in a rectangular box , one of the walls of which is a  thermal \" wall .",
    "the basic state of this system is the stripe state . in the hydrodynamic language it represents a laterally uniform stripe of increased particle density at the wall opposite to the driving wall .",
    "the stripe state was observed in experiment @xcite , and this and similar settings have served for testing the validity of quantitative modeling @xcite .",
    "it turns out that ( i ) within a  spinodal \" interval of area fractions and ( ii ) if the system is sufficiently wide in the lateral direction , the stripe state is unstable with respect to small density perturbations in the lateral direction @xcite . within a broader  binodal \" ( or coexistence ) interval",
    "the stripe state is stable to small perturbations , but unstable to sufficiently large ones @xcite . in both cases",
    "the stripe gives way , usually via a coarsening process , to coexistence of dense and dilute regions of the granulate ( granular  droplets \" and  bubbles \" ) along the wall opposite to the driving wall @xcite .",
    "this far - from - equilibrium phase separation phenomenon is strikingly similar to a gas - liquid transition as described by the classical van der waals model , except for large fluctuations observed in a broad region of aspect ratios around the instability threshold @xcite .",
    "the large fluctuations have not yet received a theoretical explanation .",
    "this work addresses a phase separation process in a different geometry .",
    "we will deal here with an assembly of hard disks at zero gravity , colliding inelastically inside a two - dimensional annulus .",
    "the interior wall of the annulus drives the granulate into a non - equilibrium steady state with a ( hydrodynamically ) zero mean flow .",
    "particle collisions with the exterior wall are assumed elastic .",
    "the basic steady state of this system , as predicted by hydrodynamics , is the _ annular _ state : an azimuthally symmetric state of increased particle density at the exterior wall .",
    "the phase separation instability manifests itself here in the appearance of dense clusters with broken azimuthal symmetry along the exterior wall .",
    "our main objectives are to characterize the instability and compute the phase diagram by using granular hydrodynamics ( or , more precisely , granular hydrostatics , see below ) and event driven molecular dynamics simulations . by focusing on the annular geometry , we hope to motivate experimental studies of the granular phase separation which may be advantageous in this geometry .",
    "the annular setting avoids lateral side walls ( with an unnecessary / unaccounted for energy loss of the particles ) .",
    "furthermore , driving can be implemented here by a rapid rotation of the ( slightly eccentric and possibly rough ) interior circle .",
    "we organized the paper as follows .",
    "section [ secii ] deals with a hydrodynamic description of the annular state of the gas .",
    "as we will be dealing only with states with a zero mean flow , we will call the respective equations hydrostatic .",
    "a marginal stability analysis predicts a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the annular state .",
    "we compute the marginal stability curves and compare them to the borders of the spinodal ( negative compressibility ) interval of the system .",
    "in section [ seciii ] we report event - driven molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of this system and compare the simulation results with the hydrostatic theory . in section [ seciv ]",

    "the disks undergo inelastic collisions with a constant coefficient of normal restitution @xmath6 . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the rotational degree of freedom of the particles .",
    "the ( driving ) interior wall is modeled by a thermal wall kept at temperature @xmath7 , whereas particle collisions with the exterior wall are considered elastic .",
    "the energy transferred from the thermal wall to the granulate dissipates in the particle inelastic collisions , and we assume that the system reaches a ( non - equilibrium ) steady state with a zero mean flow .",

    "this allows us to safely use granular hydrodynamics @xcite .",

    "we also investigated an alternative setting in which the exterior wall is the driving wall , while the interior wall is elastic .",

    "azimuthally symmetric clusters appear near the ( elastic ) interior wall .",
    "symmetry breaking instability occurs here as well .",

    "the inelastic particle collisions with the exterior wall were modeled in the same way as the inelastic collisions between particles .",
    "typical results of these simulations are shown in fig .",

    "we combined equations of granular hydrostatics and event - driven md simulations to investigate spontaneous phase separation of a monodisperse gas of inelastically colliding hard disks in a two - dimensional annulus , the inner circle of which serves as a  thermal wall \" .",
    "a marginal stability analysis yields a region of the parameter space where the annular state  the basic , azimuthally symmetric steady state of the system  is unstable with respect to small perturbations which break the azimuthal symmetry .",
    "the physics behind the instability is negative effective compressibility of the gas in the azimuthal direction , which results from the inelastic energy loss .",
    "md simulations of this system show phase separation , but it is masked by large spatio - temporal fluctuations . by measuring the probability distribution of the amplitude of the fundamental fourier mode of the azimuthal spectrum of the particle density we have been able to clearly identify the transition to phase separated states in the md simulations .",
    "we have found that the instability region of the parameter space , predicted from hydrostatics , is located within the phase separation region observed in the md simulations .",
    "this implies the presence of a binodal ( coexistence ) region , where the annular state is _ metastable _ , similar to what was found in rectangular geometry @xcite .",
    "the instability persists in an alternative setting ( a driving exterior wall and an elastic interior wall ) , and also when the elastic wall is replaced by a weakly inelastic one .",
    "we hope our results will stimulate experimental work on the phase separation instability .",
