    "government statistical agencies have statutory and ethical obligations to protect the confidentiality of the data they collect . at the same time , their core mission is to ensure that these data are used effectively for statistical purposes .",
    "tensions between these two objectives may arise , in particular , when access to microdata on individuals or establishments is to be provided to researchers , so that they may conduct their own analyses of social or economic phenomena .",
    "although microdata may be anonymized by removing obvious identifying information such as name and address without damage to the statistical analyses , such anonymization will rarely be considered sufficient for confidentiality protection , since the rich socio - economic information in the microdata may often enable records to be identified by matching to another data source on known individuals or establishments .",
    "agencies have therefore developed a number of ways of protecting confidentiality in this context .",
    "one common approach is to modify the microdata file by applying a statistical disclosure limitation ( sdl ) method , such as recoding or data perturbation , to those variables judged potentially identifying [ federal committee on statistical methodology ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "such modification can , however , seriously reduce the utility of the microdata and it is therefore important for the agency to be able to assess the protection provided by such methods in order to be able to make judgements about the degree of modification to apply .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop methodology to assess the disclosure protection provided by the misclassification of one or more categorical identifying variables .",
    "misclassification is supposed here to arise in one of two ways .",
    "first , it may be the result of the deliberate application by the agency of an sdl method , specifically we consider the methods of data swapping [ dalenius and reiss ( @xcite ) ] and post - randomization or pram [ gouweleeuw et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] .",
    "this paper is motivated by experience of the use of such methods at government statistical agencies ( especially in the united kingdom ) with microdata from social surveys on individuals or from population censuses . in these cases , the potential identifying variables which might be used for matching are invariably categorical .",
    "a second way in which misclassification may arise is as a result of measurement error which arises naturally in surveys and takes the form of misclassification for categorical variables [ kuha and skinner ( @xcite ) ] . in this case",
    ", we shall suppose that the agency has some information about the nature of the misclassification mechanism .    in the current practice of statistical agencies , when the disclosure protection of such methods is assessed , it is usually based upon simple measures , such as functions of the diagonal elements of the misclassification matrix [ willenborg and de waal ( @xcite ) , page  119 ] , or a simple estimated probability that an apparent match is correct [ gouweleeuw et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] , or via the outcome of a record linkage experiment ( see below ) .",
    "reiter ( @xcite ) developed a more sophisticated approach by defining a measure of identification risk , based upon the modeling framework of duncan and lambert ( @xcite ) , and showing how it could be assessed before and after the application of a number of sdl methods , including data swapping .",
    "this focus on identification risk is often appropriate in government contexts , where judgments about protection are informed by legislation or codes of practice which express threats to confidentiality in terms of individual respondents being identified .",
    "however , the need to model a very wide range of microdata variables and relationships in reiter s ( @xcite ) approach may limit its application in practice . in this paper",
    "we develop an approach which is based on a similar framework to reiter ( @xcite ) , but which retains some of the simplicity of the former methods . we achieve simplification by restricting the information set upon which the risk measure is conditioned , extending the approach of skinner and shlomo ( @xcite ) .",
    "our approach also extends reiter ( @xcite ) by taking fuller account of the protection achieved from sampling .    assessing identification risk using record linkage experiments [ e.g. , yancy , winkler and creecy ( @xcite ) ; domingo - ferrer and torra ( @xcite ) ] is natural given the threat that such methods pose [ fienberg ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "the experiment typically involves matching records in the microdata file , masked by an sdl method , to records in the original unmasked file .",
    "the risk is often defined as the proportion of such matches which are correct [ spruill ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "a problem with this approach is that it makes an unjustified assumption that a hypothetical intruder has access to data that are as good as the original data and may not take account of the disclosure protection provided by sampling .",
    "we shall show in the that our proposed approach to assessing identification risk in the case of exact matching does , in fact , provide a closed form expression for the correct match proportion which would be estimated by an experiment using a form of probabilistic record linkage proposed by fellegi and sunter ( @xcite ) .",
    "record linkage experiments have the potential to capture the impact of a wider range of types of potential attack , including those that make explicit allowance for data masking and exploit greater computational power [ winkler ( @xcite ) ] , but consideration of such extensions is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "statistical modeling approaches to identification risk assessment have been proposed by a number of authors [ e.g. , paass ( @xcite ) ; duncan and lambert ( @xcite ) ; fuller ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "it is generally assumed that an intruder seeks to identify an individual in the microdata by matching records to known individuals in the population using identifying variables , also called key variables , values of which are known both for the microdata records and for the known individuals .",
    "this paper builds on the literature which has used models for categorical key variables as a basis for assessing disclosure risk .",
    "bethlehem , keller and pannekoek ( @xcite ) is a seminal contribution .",
    "we follow especially skinner and shlomo ( @xcite ) , who considered the use of log - linear models to assess identification risk . their work did not , however , consider the impact of sdl methods on risk , other than the recoding of key variables .",
    "the empirical work in this paper is based upon the 2001 population census in great britain , which will be used to provide population data to validate risk assessments for samples , viewed as representing potential sample surveys",
    ". our focus will be on the impact of sdl methods on identification risk .",
    "the effects of these methods on the utility of potential data analyses is also vitally important and we provide some information loss measures to analyze and compare the perturbation methods .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "measures of identification risk in the presence of misclassification are developed in section  [ za ] .",
    "since these measures depend upon population quantities which may be unknown , methods of estimating these measures using sample data are considered in section  [ zb ] .",
    "applications using census data are presented in section  [ zc ] for a random and targeted data swapping method and a random and targeted post - randomization method ( pram ) .",
    "a further numerical illustration with multivariate misclassification is presented in section  [ zq ] .",
    "section  [ zs ] contains a concluding discussion .",
    "consider the release of a microdata file consisting of records for a sample @xmath0 drawn from a finite population @xmath1 of size @xmath2 .",
    "we suppose an intruder seeks to match a known target unit in @xmath1 to a record in the file using @xmath3 categorical key variables @xmath4 .",
    "we assume the agency knows the intruder s choice of key variables .",
    "possible departures from this assumption are discussed in section  [ zs ] .",
    "the variable formed by cross - classifying the key variables , as measured by the intruder on the target unit , is denoted @xmath5 and its values are labeled @xmath6 .",
    "the value of @xmath5 recorded in the microdata , after the application of the sdl method ( and natural measurement error ) , is denoted @xmath7 .",
    "we treat the values of @xmath5 for population units as fixed and suppose the values of @xmath7 for the records in the microdata are determined independently by a misclassification matrix @xmath8 , where @xmath9    to assess the disclosure protection provided by misclassification , we imagine that the intruder observes a match between a specific sample unit @xmath10 and a target population unit @xmath11 , that is , observes @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the value of @xmath7 for unit @xmath10 and @xmath14 is the value of @xmath5 for unit @xmath11 ) , and measures disclosure risk in terms of the uncertainty as to whether @xmath15 . a simple ad hoc measure of this uncertainty is given by @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) , where @xmath18 is the common value of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "willenborg and de waal [ ( @xcite ) , page  121 ] propose that the agency specifies upper bounds for these diagonal elements of @xmath8 according to the level of protection required .",
    "following reiter ( @xcite ) , we define the identification risk as @xmath19 , where the values @xmath13 and @xmath14 are implicitly included in the @xmath20 and the nature of the probability mechanism will be clarified later . a simplified approach to estimating this risk is given by gouweleeuw et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who make the very conservative assumption that the intruder knows that @xmath11 is in the sample and approximate @xmath19 by @xmath21 , which they estimate by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of units in @xmath24 for which @xmath25 ( they in fact use the odds rather than the probability ) .",
    "in contrast to the highly simplifying assumptions of gouweleeuw et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , reiter ( @xcite ) allows for considerable generality by adopting a very wide definition of @xmath20 in @xmath19 , so that it may include all the values of @xmath26 in the sample as well as the values of any other microdata variables .",
    "this creates not only a major modeling task to assess the probability of interest , but also the possibility that this probability will be sensitive to the specification of the model .",
    "we seek an intermediate position , avoiding the very conservative assumption that the intruder knows that @xmath11 is in the sample , but reducing the scope of @xmath20 in @xmath19 to avoid the complex modeling issues .",
    "we define the matching variable @xmath27 to be 1 if @xmath28 and 0 otherwise and we take the data to consist of the values @xmath27 for @xmath29 .",
    "we suggest that this is the critical information to consider when assessing the probability that an observed match is correct .",
    "we shall also restrict our attention further to the case when a unique sample unit matches @xmath11 ( so @xmath30 and @xmath31 if @xmath32 for some unit @xmath33 ) .",
    "this is the worst case and thus of most interest , that is , the risk will be lower if @xmath11 matches more than one sample unit . in this case , we obtain the following expression for the identification risk : @xmath34\\\\[-8pt ] & = & \\operatorname{pr}(e_{b})\\big/\\sum_{a\\in{u}}\\operatorname{pr}(e_{a}),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the event that population unit @xmath36 is sampled and its value @xmath37 matches @xmath14 and that no other population unit is both sampled and has a value of @xmath7 which matches @xmath14 . in order to allow for the effect of unequal probability sampling and the potential use of sampling weights , we suppose that units in the population @xmath1 are selected independently into the sample @xmath24 with inclusion probabilities @xmath38 which may depend on the value @xmath39 for the unit .",
    "writing @xmath40 and @xmath41 and using our previous assumptions about the misclassification mechanism , we obtain @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the number of units in the population with @xmath45 .",
    "hence,@xmath46\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\qquad=[m_{jj}/(1-\\pi_{j}{m_{jj } } ) ] \\big/\\biggl[\\sum_{k}f_{k}m_{jk}/(1-\\pi_{j}{m_{jk}})\\biggr].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression assumes the intruder does not know whether @xmath47 .",
    "if this event was known to arise and was included in the conditioning set , ( [ ef ] ) should be modified by setting @xmath48 and replacing @xmath49 by @xmath23 .",
    "this produces an expression that is similar to that given earlier in ( [ ht ] ) from gouweleeuw et al .",
    "( @xcite ) but makes fewer approximations . for expression ( [ ef ] ) , the identification risk also assumes that the @xmath49 are part of the data , that is , known . in practice",
    ", this will often not be the case , as discussed by skinner and shlomo ( @xcite ) , and it will be necessary to integrate the @xmath49 out of this expression as will be discussed in section  [ zb ] .",
    "it follows from ( [ ef ] ) that @xmath50 with equality holding if there is no misclassification .",
    "the extent to which the left - hand side of this inequality is less than the right - hand side measures the impact of misclassification on disclosure risk .",
    "if the inclusion probabilities @xmath38 are all small , we may approximate ( [ ef ] ) by @xmath51    moreover , if the population size is large , we have approximately @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the number of units in the population which would have @xmath54 if they were included in the microdata ( with misclassification ) .",
    "hence , a simple approximate expression for the risk , natural for many social surveys , is@xmath55    an alternative derivation of this result is provided in the under the assumption that the intruder adopts the probabilistic record linkage approach of fellegi and sunter ( @xcite ) , making a link if the match variable @xmath30 .",
    "the identification risk is the probability that the match is correct and the above approximation is obtained if the probability is defined with respect to the sampling scheme , the misclassification mechanism and a random selection of a pair for matching as in fellegi and sunter ( @xcite ) .",
    "another approximation to expression ( [ ef ] ) is obtained by assuming the misclassification is small , say , @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xmath58 , where the @xmath59 are fixed and @xmath60 . in this case , we have@xmath61\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\qquad\\approx{f}_{jj}^{-1}\\bigl(1-[\\tilde{f}_{j}-f_{j}m_{jj}]/[f_{j}m_{jj}/(1-\\pi_{j}{m}_{jj})]\\bigr)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or @xmath62\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\qquad\\approx[m_{jj}/(1-\\pi_{j}{m}_{jj})]/[(f_{j}\\pi_{j}{m}_{jj}^{2})/(1-\\pi{m}_{jj})+\\tilde{f}_{j}].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that none of approximations ( [ gh ] ) , ( [ ij ] ) or ( [ kl ] ) depend upon @xmath63 for @xmath64 and so knowledge of these probabilities is not required in the estimation of risk .",
    "the definition of risk in ( [ cd ] ) applies to a specific record .",
    "agencies will also usually wish to consider aggregate measures to enable them to make judgements about the whole file .",
    "following skinner and shlomo ( @xcite ) , we define an aggregate measure as the sum of the record - level measures in ( [ ef ] ) across sample unique records : @xmath65\\big/\\biggl[\\sum _ { k}f_{k}m_{jk}/(1-\\pi_{j}{m_{jk}})\\biggr ] , \\label{vt}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the set of key variable values which are sample unique .",
    "this measure may be interpreted as the expected number of correct matches among sample uniques .",
    "for some purposes , an agency might find this measure easier to interpret if it is transformed into a measure with an upper bound , such as by dividing by the number of sample uniques to obtain a proportion .",
    "however , we shall stick with the untransformed @xmath67 as a measure of the total number of units , for example , individuals , threatened with identification .",
    "we also consider , for comparison , a related measure which could be used if the misclassification status of microdata records is known .",
    "let @xmath68 denote the set of key variable values which are sample unique and where these sample unique values have been correctly classified .",
    "the measure is given by@xmath69 and again may be interpreted as the expected number of correct matches among sample uniques .",
    "we also define @xmath70 as the corresponding measure of risk in the absence of perturbation , that is , the sum of @xmath71 across key values which are unique in the sample with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "an agency wishing to apply an sdc method to survey microdata will generally not know the values of @xmath44 or @xmath72 appearing in the risk expressions .",
    "we do suppose that the values of @xmath63 are known .",
    "skinner and shlomo ( @xcite ) discuss the estimation of risk in the absence of misclassification based on a poisson log - linear model . in this case ,",
    "expression ( [ ef ] ) reduces to @xmath71 and their broad approach is to define the risk as the conditional expectation of this quantity given the observed data and to estimate this expectation using data for the sample counts @xmath73 , @xmath74 , for which a log - linear model is fitted .",
    "expression ( [ gh ] ) provides a simple way to extend their approach to misclassification provided @xmath16 is known . since the @xmath75 , @xmath74 , represent the available data , all that is required is to ignore the misclassification and estimate the expectation of @xmath76 given the data from the @xmath75 , @xmath74 , as in skinner and shlomo ( @xcite ) , that is , by fitting a log - linear model now to the @xmath75 , @xmath74 , following the same criteria as before .",
    "this results in an estimate @xmath77 based on the assumptions of the poisson distribution for the population and sample counts .",
    "these estimates should be multiplied by the @xmath16 values and summed if aggregate measures of the form in ( [ vt ] ) are needed .",
    "it would appear to be rather more complex to estimate the expressions including terms in @xmath44 . in the presence of complex sampling",
    ", the estimation method may be adapted using the method of pseudo maximum likelihood estimation [ rao and thomas ( @xcite ) ] by incorporating survey weights in the estimation as discussed by skinner and shlomo ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we consider two specific perturbative sdl techniques used at statistical agencies : data swapping and the post - randomization method ( pram ) .",
    "both techniques introduce misclassification of the key variables to lower the probabilities of identifying individuals .",
    "we present examples of how to assess the impact of these techniques on identification risk .",
    "since the misclassification is under the control of the statistical agency , the misclassification matrix @xmath8 is known .",
    "the method of data swapping is based on exchanging the values of one or more key variables between pairs of records . in order to minimize bias ,",
    "the pairs of records are typically selected within strata defined by control variables , such as the age and sex of the individual .",
    "in addition , the perturbation can be targeted to high - risk records that are more likely to be population uniques , for example , on rare ethnicities .",
    "it is common that geographic variables are swapped between records for the following reasons :    * for given values of the control variables , the sensitive variables are likely to be relatively independent of geography and , therefore , it is expected that less bias will occur .",
    "in addition , swapping geography will not normally result in inconsistent and illogical records .",
    "by contrast , swapping a variable such as age would result in many inconsistencies with other variables , such as marital status and education .",
    "* at a higher geographical level and within control strata , the marginal distributions are preserved .",
    "* the level of protection increases by swapping variables which are highly `` matchable '' such as geography .    for this experiment , we carry out a simple data swapping procedure where the geography variable of local authority district ( lad ) is exchanged between a pair of individuals .",
    "the population includes @xmath78 individuals from an extract of the 2001 united kingdom ( uk ) census .",
    "we drew @xmath79 bernoulli samples ( @xmath80 ) and define six key variables for the risk assessment : local authority ( lad ) ( 11 ) , sex ( 2 ) , age groups ( 24 ) , marital status ( 6 ) , ethnicity ( 17 ) , economic activity ( 10 ) , where the numbers of categories of each variable are in parentheses ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "we implement a random data swap by drawing a sub - sample of @xmath82 and @xmath83 in each of the lads .",
    "the remaining individuals are not perturbed . on the sub - samples in each lad ,",
    "half of the individuals are flagged .",
    "for each flagged individual , an unflagged individual is randomly chosen within the sub - sample and their lad variables swapped , on condition that the individual chosen was not previously selected for swapping and that the two individuals do not have the same lad , that is , no individual is selected twice for producing a pair .",
    "we also implemented a @xmath82 and @xmath83 targeted data swap where the lad variable is swapped separately within two groups defined by `` white british '' and `` other '' ethnicities . for the @xmath83 swap",
    ", lads were swapped randomly between all pairs of individuals in the `` other '' group and a small percentage ( @xmath84 ) of individuals in the `` white british '' group .",
    "this swapping rate was chosen so that the total percentage of swapped individuals would be @xmath83 as in the random data swapping . for the @xmath82 swap",
    ", lads were swapped randomly from among the `` other '' group that compose @xmath82 of the total individuals in the sample .",

    "we draw a line to connect points on the risk - utility frontier [ gomatam , karr and sanil ( @xcite ) ] and note that in all cases , at given levels of information loss , the targeted data swapping provides the lowest disclosure risk compared to the other methods , although there is little difference between targeted swapping and targeted pram .",
    "targeting did not appear to lead to much greater information loss for the other measures in table  [ pars ] and the general conclusion here is that targeting seems useful , enabling less perturbation to be applied and hence less information loss for a given level of risk protection .",
    "of course , this finding could vary in other settings and an agency could use a similar risk - utility approach , based on its own data , to determine its preferred sdl approach .",
    "the previous section only provided estimates of the impact of misclassifying one key variable . in this section",
    "we provide a further numerical illustration to demonstrate the potential impact of misclassifying multiple key variables .",
    "we consider a simple setup where the @xmath3 key variables @xmath169 are independent and binary .",
    "their values in the external information and the microdata are denoted @xmath105 and @xmath170 respectively , @xmath171 .",

    "in our experiment we generated values of @xmath5 for a population of size @xmath2 , drew a sample of size @xmath107 by simple random sampling and then generated the values @xmath7 .",
    "various choices of @xmath183 were considered .",
    "we also generated @xmath7 for all population units so that @xmath72 could be computed .",
    "we report values of risk measure ( [ gh ] ) summed over sample uniques @xmath184 in figure  [ fig1 ] for @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 and for various choices of @xmath3 and @xmath188 .",
    "note that the number of sample uniques increases as we add in more binary key variables .",
    "for @xmath189 we have about 240 sample uniques and for @xmath190 we have about 1960 sample uniques . in the absence of misclassification , we find that the risk increases monotonically and rapidly with @xmath3 .",
    "this is because the number of population uniques is increasing with @xmath3 and the fact that any observed match with a population unique must be a true match . on the other hand , in the presence of misclassification",
    ", we find that the risk does not increase monotonically , rather it reaches a maximum and then declines .",
    "as expected , the more misclassification , the lower the disclosure risk .",
    "we do not present information loss measures for the simulation since their values follow theoretically . for any analysis involving",
    "a given set of variables , say , the estimation of a table cross - classifying two particular key variables , the addition of further key variables will have no systematic impact on any of the information loss measures , since each of the variables of interest will be perturbed in the same way , irrespective of the inclusion of other key variables .",
    "the only variation we might expect to observe would be as a result of simulation variation .",
    "any information loss function in figure  [ fig1 ] should therefore be flat .",
    "in this paper we have shown how existing methods for assessing identification risk in survey microdata may be extended in a relatively simple way to capture the impact of sdl methods based on misclassification .",
    "we presented a general expression for the risk under misclassification in ( [ ef ] ) and showed that the simple formula in ( [ gh ] ) provided a good approximation to this expression in two experiments based upon uk census data .",
    "the advantage of the formula in ( [ gh ] ) is that it enables the extension of existing risk assessment methods for unpeturbed data based on poisson log - linear models , as discussed in skinner and shlomo ( @xcite ) , to handle perturbative sdl methods .",
    "we demonstrated this extended approach also with the census data and provided a disclosure risk - data utility analysis .",
    "we showed how a targeted sdl method could dominate corresponding random methods .",
    "one challenge faced by agencies when assessing identification risk is the need to make assumptions about the information available to the intruder , specifically the nature and number of key variables .",
    "we conducted a numerical experiment to assess the sensitivity of the identification risk to the misclassification of different numbers of key variables . in the absence of misclassification",
    ", the risk can increase rapidly with the number of key variables .",
    "we observed that misclassification can , however , dominate this effect with the risk eventually declining as the number of key variables increases .",
    "this is potentially an encouraging finding for agencies , since the sensitivity of the identification risk to departures from assumptions about the choice of key variables may be reduced in some settings when the kinds of sdl methods considered here are used and , in cases such as in figure  [ fig1 ] , there may even be a natural upper bound for the risk across plausible choices .",
    "another issue faced by agencies is whether to release values of the parameters of the sdl method employed , for example , the swapping rate .",
    "the information loss measures used in section  [ sec4.4 ] assume that users of the microdata simply ignore the perturbation in their analyses of the data .",
    "the agency s aim is to find an sdl method for which both the information loss and the disclosure risk are considered satisfactorily small .",
    "if this is not feasible , then it may be necessary for the agency to resort to an sdl method which leads to nonnegligible distortion of analyses . in this case",
    "it may be desirable for data analysts to be provided with values of the parameters of the sdl method to enable them to undertake valid inference , as discussed , for example , in gouweleeuw et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for pram ( note that our use of invariant pram was designed to avoid this need ) .",
    "the disclosure risk implications of releasing such sdl parameters will not be pursued further here .",
    "the findings of this paper are not only relevant to understanding the impact of sdl methods , but also to the assessment of risk , before the application of sdl methods , in a way which more realistically takes account of the errors of classification which arise in survey data from measurement , coding and processing as well as from imputation for missing data , providing the agency has estimates for the diagonal elements of the misclassification matrix .",
    "suppose , as before , that a microdata record @xmath191 is linked to a target unit @xmath11 by comparing the values of @xmath26 and @xmath14 . following the approach of fellegi and sunter ( @xcite ) , let @xmath192 if @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 if @xmath196 and suppose that exact matching is used , so that a link is made if @xmath197 .",
