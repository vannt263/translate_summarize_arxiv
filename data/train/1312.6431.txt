    "the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , as one of the universal equations that describe the evolution of slowly varying packets of quasi - monochromatic waves in weakly nonlinear dispersive media , has been very successful in many applications such as nonlinear optics and water waves @xcite .",
    "the nls equation is integrable , which can be solved by the inverse scattering transform zakharov .",
    "however , in the regime of ultra - short pulses where the width of optical pulse is in the order of femtosecond ( @xmath0 s ) , the nls equation becomes less accurate @xcite .",
    "description of ultra - short processes requires a modification of standard slow varying envelope models based on the nls equation .",
    "there are usually two approaches to meet this requirement in the literature .",
    "the first one is to add several higher - order dispersive terms to get higher - order nls equation @xcite .",
    "the second one is to construct a suitable fit to the frequency - dependent dielectric constant @xmath1 in the desired spectral range .",
    "several models have been proposed by this approach including the short - pulse ( sp ) equation @xcite .",
    "recently , schfer and wayne derived a so - called short pulse ( sp ) equation @xcite @xmath2to describe the propagation of ultra - short optical pulses in nonlinear media . here , @xmath3 is a real - valued function , representing the magnitude of the electric field , the subscripts @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote partial differentiation .",
    "apart from the context of nonlinear optics , the sp equation has also been derived as an integrable differential equation associated with pseudospherical surfaces @xcite .",
    "the sp equation has been shown to be completely integrable @xcite .",
    "the periodic and soliton solutions of the sp equation were found in sakovich2,kuetche , parkes .",
    "the connection between the sp equation and the sine - gordon equation through the hodograph transformation was clarified , and then the @xmath6-soliton solutions including multi - loop and multi - breather ones were given in @xcite by using the hirota bilinear method @xcite .",
    "the integrable discretization of the sp equation was studied in @xcite , the geometric interpretation of the sp equation , as well as its integrable discretization , was given in @xcite .",
    "the higher - order corrections to the sp equation was studied in @xcite most recently .",
    "similar to the case of the nls equation @xcite , it is necessary to consider its two - component or multi - component generalizations of the sp equation for describing the effects of polarization or anisotropy . as a matter of fact",
    ", several integrable coupled short pulse have been proposed in the literature pkb_cspe , sakovich3,hoissen_cspe , matsuno_cspe , feng_cspe , zengyao_cspe .",
    "most recently , the bi - hamiltonian structures for the above two - component sp equations were obtained by brunelli @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we propose and study a complex short pulse ( csp ) equation @xmath7and its two - component generalization @xmath8 as will be revealed in the present paper , both the csp equation and its two - component generalization are integrable guaranteed by the existence of lax pairs and infinite number of conservation laws .",
    "they have @xmath6-soliton solutions which can be constructed via hirota s bilinear method .",
    "the outline of the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we derive the csp equation and coupled complex short pulse ( ccsp ) equation from the physical context . in section 3 , by providing the lax pairs , the integrability of the proposed two equations are confirmed , and further , the conservation laws , both local and nonlocal ones , are investigated . then @xmath6-soliton solutions to both the csp and",
    "ccsp equations are constructed in terms of pfaffians by hirota s bilinear method in section 4 . in section 5 , soliton - interaction for coupled complex short pulse equation",
    "is investigated in details , which shows rich phenomena similar to the coupled nonlinear schrdinger equatoin .",
    "in particular , they may undergo either elastic or inelastic collision depending on the initial conditions .",
    "for inelastic collisions , there is an energy exchange between solitons , which can allow the generation or vanishing of soliton .",
    "the dynamics is more richer in compared with the single component case .",
    "the paper is concluded by comments and remarks in section 6 .",
    "in this section , following the procedure in @xcite , we derive the complex short pulse equation ( [ csp ] ) and its two - component generalization that governs the propagation of ultra short pulse packet along optical fibers .      we start with a wave equation for electric field @xmath9 originated from the maxwell equation . here",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the electric field and the induced polarization , respectively , @xmath12 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath13 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "if we assume the local medium response and only the third - order nonlinear effects governed by @xmath14 , the induced polarization consists of two parts , @xmath15 , where the linear part @xmath16 and the nonlinear part @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath19 is the @xmath20th - order susceptibility .",
    "since the nonlinear effects are relatively small in silica fibers , @xmath21 can be treated as a small perturbation .",
    "therefore , we first consider ( [ e - wave - equation ] ) with @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , we restrict ourselves to the case that the optical pulse maintains its polarization along the optical fiber , and the transverse diffraction term @xmath23 can be neglected . in this case",
    ", the electric field can be considered to be one - dimensional and expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a unit vector in the direction of the polarization , @xmath26 is the complex - valued function , and @xmath27 stands for the complex conjugate . conducting a fourier",
    "transform on ( [ e - wave - equation ] ) leads to the helmholtz equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fourier transform of @xmath26 defined as @xmath30 @xmath1 is called the frequency - dependent dielectric constant defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fourier transform of @xmath33 @xmath34 now we proceed to the consideration of the nonlinear effect . assuming the nonlinear response is instantaneous so that @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 @xcite where the nonlinear contribution to the dielectric constant is defined as @xmath37 in this case , the helmholtz equation ( [ waveequation - fourier ] ) can be modified as @xmath38 where @xmath39 as pointed out in @xcite , the fourier transform @xmath40 can be well approximated by the relation @xmath41 if we consider the propagation of optical pulse with the wavelength between 1600 nm and 3000 nm .",
    "it then follows that the linear equation ( waveequation - fourier ) written in fourier transformed form becomes @xmath42    applying the inverse fourier transform to ( [ wave_fourier2 ] ) yields a single nonlinear wave equation @xmath43    similar to @xcite , we focus on only a right - moving wave packet and make a multiple scales @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a small parameter , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the scaled variables defined by @xmath48 substituting ( [ e_ansatz ] ) with ( [ multiple_ansatz ] ) into ( wave_nonlinear1 ) , we obtain the following partial differential equation for @xmath49 at the order @xmath50 :    @xmath51    finally , by a scale transformation @xmath52 we arrive at the normalized form of the complex short pulse equation ( csp ) .      in the previous subsection ,",
    "a major simplification made in the derivation of the complex short pulse equation is to assume that the polarization is preserved during its propagating inside an optical fiber .",
    "however , this is not really the case in practice . for birefringent fibers , two orthogonally polarized modes have to be considered .",
    "therefore , similar to the extension of coupled nonlinear schrdinger equation from the nls equation , an extension to a two - component version of the complex short pulse equation ( [ csp ] ) is needed to describe the propagation of ultra - short pulse in birefringent fibers .",
    "in fact , several generalizations have been proposed for the short pulse equation pkb_cspe , sakovich3,hoissen_cspe , matsuno_cspe , feng_cspe , zengyao_cspe .",

    "we follow the approach by pietrzyk _ et .",
