    "one of the most fundamental concepts in the quantum description of nature is that of entanglement @xcite .",
    "entanglement constitutes a physical resource that lies at the heart of important information processes @xcite such as quantum teleportation , superdense coding , and quantum computation .",
    "it has recently been proved that the generic entanglement , defined as the entanglement of random states , can be produced in a polynomial time using random two - qubit gates @xcite .",
    "random states and random unitary operators are the quantum analogs of random numbers and are two basic concepts in quantum information and quantum communication tasks .",
    "random unitary operators are involved in the superdense coding of arbitrary states @xcite while the classical capacity of a noisy quantum channel is saturated by random quantum states @xcite , just to mention two very significant applications .",
    "both of them are well defined by the haar measure which remains invariant under unitary transformation .",
    "since the generation of random states is exponentially hard we study the production of states with the same distribution of entanglement , a task that can be performed with fewer physical resources @xcite .",
    "although a large amount of different multipartite entanglement measures has recently been proposed , a considerable amount of research has particularly been devoted to the study of multiqubit entanglement measures defined as the sum of bipartite entanglement measures over all ( or an appropriate family of ) the possible bi - partitions of the full system @xcite .",
    "there exist two popular entanglement measures for multiqubit pure states , one based on the von neumann entropy of marginal density matrices and the other one based upon the linear entropy of those matrices .",
    "it has recently been shown that the von neumann entropy based measure is able to grasp more features of highly entangled states than the linear entropy based measure @xcite .",
    "it is then expected that when the efficient generation of random states is studied in the light of these entanglement measures , some differences will arise because , as a consequence of the  concentration of measure \" phenomenon , these states are almost maximally entangled @xcite .",
    "et al_. @xcite introduced a protocol for generating pseudo - random unitary operators .",
    "a circuit of repeated two - qubit gates was considered acting on a separable state of @xmath0 qubits .",
    "the unitary operation is given by the combination of two independent single qubit rotations , chosen according to the invariant haar measure at each time step , and a fixed two - qubit gate .",
    "the convergence to the haar measure was shown to be polynomial with the number of qubits .",
    "some experimental evidences have reinforced these results . a markovian description of certain two - qubit gates has also been used to analytically prove that the convergence is reached in a polynomial time with the size of the system @xcite . recently , a numerical effort has allowed to identify the optimal two - qubit gate improving this analytical bound @xcite .    in these previous works convergence",
    "was studied in terms of gate complexity , i.e. the number of gates needed to reach the haar distribution . in contraposition to the gate complexity",
    ", a new complexity concept for quantum algorithms has been proposed : the time complexity @xcite , understood as the physical time needed to perform such algorithm .",
    "the minimization of this time is as important , from the experimental point of view , as the gate complexity . a considerable amount of work",
    "has recently been devoted to the time - optimal quantum computation problem , with emphasis in the quantum brachistochrone formalism @xcite .",
    "making use of the analogy with the brachistochrone problem from classic mechanics , carlini et .",
    "al @xcite introduced a variational approach to obtain the optimal hamiltonian and the optimal quantum evolution between initial and final given states . a geometric approach to solve this problem , based on the symmetry properties of the quantum states space ,",
    "was addressed in @xcite .",
    "the role of the entanglement within the quantum brachistochrone formalism was studied in @xcite .",
    "a more general result has recently been formulated in terms of the variational principle to find the time - optimal duration of a unitary transformation @xcite .",
    "this formulation is independent of the input state and because of that more general than the previously described one .",
    "the time - optimal way to obtain a two - qubit universal quantum gate was previously discussed using the cartan decomposition scheme for unitary transformation and under the constraint that one - qubit gates can be performed arbitrarily fast @xcite . to study the brachistochrone problem in relation with unitary operations ,",
    "the quantum states space is replaced with the space of unitary operators .",
    "this formalism allows to consider the constraint imposed by the finite amount of energy available in a physical experiment , as well as any other constraints imposed by experimental requirements or theoretical conditions .",
    "then , the problem of finding the optimal parameters for the hamiltonian , is reduced to the resolution of a set of ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to study the possible differences between both formalisms i.e. the gate and time complexities .",
    "we also study the dependence of the convergence rate with different entanglement measures .",

    "the efficient quantum circuit generating random quantum states of n qubits is based on the iterative application of a two - qubit quantum gate @xmath1 acting on qubits @xmath2 and @xmath3 , arbitrarily drawn from the n - qubit system , at each time step .",
    "the quantum gate @xmath1 is composed by the product of two single qubit rotation gates @xmath4 and @xmath5 uniformly drawn from the haar measure on u(2 ) , and a fixed two qubit gate @xmath6    @xmath7    where @xmath6 can be decomposed as    @xmath8 \\ , ( u_1 \\otimes u_2),\\ ] ]    with the fixed rotations @xmath9 and @xmath10 acting only on one of the two qubits , and @xmath11 are the pauli matrices @xcite . in our random entangling protocol the role of the fixed local rotations @xmath10 and @xmath9 should not be confused with the random local rotations @xmath12 , which change at each step of the protocol . as we are just interested in the entanglement generation properties of the two - qubit gates we only need to consider the action of the non local part of the decomposition ( [ 2qubit - decomp ] ) , because its entangling power is the same when averaged over a large number of realizations @xcite .",
    "the symmetries of such non - local action enables us to consider just a reduced range for the values of its parameters ( @xmath13 , \\ , k = x , y , z$ ] ) .",
    "the qubits @xmath2 and @xmath3 upon which the gate @xmath1 is applied can be chosen in several different ways , and each of them corresponds to different geometries of the system : local and non local @xcite . in the non local case qubits @xmath2 and @xmath3 are chosen randomly , the gate can act on two arbitrarily separated qubits . in the local case",
    "the gate can only act on two neighboring qubits . in this scheme we study both",
    ", periodic and open boundary conditions .",
    "the results are qualitatively the same in the local and non local case , so we only show those of the non local couplings as representative of the typical behavior .",
    "the main difference is that a larger amount of two - qubit entangling gates are needed to converge to the entanglement of random states for the local geometry .",
    "our goal is to reproduce the entanglement of typical random states , to such an end we averaged a large enough number of realizations ( typically @xmath14 ) in order to have small statistical fluctuations .",

    "1 shows that the convergence rates do not depend on the dimension of the chosen bipartition if the entanglement is quantified with the linear entropy .",
    "however , there exist small differences between the convergence rates if we use the von neumann entropy as the measure of entanglement .",
    "we have a little faster convergence for the most unbalanced bipartition .",
    "this behavior is more visible for higher dimensional states , the larger the number of qubits , the larger the difference between the convergence rates .",
    "these results imply that when working with the linear entropy , it is enough to consider the convergence of the meyer - wallach entanglement measure .",

    "in this section we are interested in the relation between the number of gates in the circuit in order to reach the haar distribution and the physical time to perform this operation . as an example we choose the heisenberg hamiltonian : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are anisotropic couplings ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is an external magnetic field in @xmath47 direction , and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , as before , the pauli matrices .",
    "the local magnetic terms appearing in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) are needed to perform the two - qubit gate operation and are not related to the random single qubit rotations @xmath12 introduced in sec .",
    "the optimal unitary evolution operator for the heisenberg hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) was obtained in @xcite . using the results of the quantum brachistochrone formalism the optimal time for some particular gates",
    "was calculated .",
    "we focus our efforts in the optimal entangler gate @xmath50 : @xmath51 with the angle @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "this gate applied to an initial separable state produces a @xmath53 dependent entangled state . when this gate is applied to the separable state @xmath54 ,",
    "produces a maximally entangled state .",
    "the optimal time duration to implement the entangler gate assuming the finite energy condition is given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is a constant given by the constraint . since the only effect of the external parameter @xmath57 is to rescale the time , in the following we take @xmath58 as this choice will not modify our results .",
    "we study the convergence rate to the haar distribution of this gate in terms of the physical time .",
    "this physical time is obtained as the product of the total number of gates @xmath59 times the optimal time @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) . as in this case the final result is not affected by the choice of the measure of entanglement , we determine the convergence using @xmath25 as a measure for the mixedness of the marginal density matrices . as before we consider the converge is reached for @xmath62    [ fig2 ]    fig .",
    "2 shows that a gate as simple as @xmath50 , which depends just on the parameter @xmath53 , is enough to reveal the differences between the gate - complexity and time - complexity concepts .",
    "the curve @xmath59 can be viewed as the time that would be necessary to reach the convergence if all the gates took the same time @xmath63 to perform each evolution . in such case ,",
    "all gates with values of @xmath53 in the interval ( @xmath64 ) would contribute to a reasonably efficient algorithm .",
    "the optimal gate would be attained by @xmath65 .",
    "but , as can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "2 , the optimal time @xmath60 needed to perform each iteration is far from being the same for all the values of @xmath53 .",
    "it increases with the value of @xmath53 , been negligible for values of @xmath53 near zero , point at which the entangling gate becomes the identity . if we combine both magnitudes , we obtain the total physical time @xmath66 , which inherits the main properties of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the global behavior resembles that of @xmath59 , both of them diverge for the extremal values @xmath67 and @xmath68 while attaining their lower and optimum values for central values of @xmath53 .",
    "the asymmetry of @xmath66 compared to @xmath59 comes from the behavior of @xmath60 . while @xmath59 is symmetric respect its optimum and central value @xmath65 , the optimum gate according to @xmath66 corresponds to a lower value of such parameter ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the case studied in this section is a good example of the role that the time complexity can play when designing an efficient quantum algorithm according to the gate complexity there exist a big range of values of @xmath53 for which the random states generating algorithm is quite efficient . if one introduces the time complexity argument this degeneracy is broken .",
    "the difference between the time needed by these efficient gates is not huge but it is enough to be taken into account , specially in a situation where the algorithm must be run a large number of times .",
    "we have studied the generation of multipartite entangled states considering a protocol of a two - qubit fixed gate combined with two one - qubit random rotations .",
    "a comparison was made between the gate complexity and the time complexity revealing that they are two different optimality problems . in a real case",
    "both complexities should be taken into account , and the optimal gate would be one with a reasonable good behavior according to both points of view . nevertheless , when the algorithm must be run a large number of time , the optimization of time complexity is mandatory .",
    "in the example studied in sec .",
    "iii , the time complexity optimization allowed us to find an optimal gate between the whole family of gates which are almost equally efficient according to the gate complexity .",
    "the quantum brachistochrone formalism seems to be a promising approach for the treatment of the time complexity problem . following the work of carlini _",
    "et al_. @xcite it is possible to obtain the optimal way to realize a given quantum gate , introducing in this derivation any constraint given by the experimental setup .",
    "we also focused in the possible dependence of the resulting entanglement on the different allowed bipartitions of the system .",
    "we found that when the linear entropy is considered , the convergence rates are independent of the bipartition scheme .",
    "however the convergence rates are different if we use the von neumann entropy . in this case",
    "the most balanced bipartition should be considered to guarantee the convergence .",
