    "the cosmological principle which assumes that the universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales is one of the fundamental assumptions of modern cosmology .",
    "this assumption can not be proved in a rigorously mathematical sense but can be verified from various cosmological observations . testing",
    "the assumption of statistical homogeneity and isotropy is important as our interpretations of various cosmological observations are based on our current understanding of the universe which in turn relies on the cosmological principle .",
    "homogeneity and isotropy are two different but related aspects which may or may not coexist in a system",
    ". the universe can be homogeneous without being isotropic or can be isotropic around a point without being homogeneous .",
    "but isotropy around each and every point guarantees homogeneity .",
    "observationally the most powerful evidence for isotropy is provided by the the near uniform temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) across the whole sky @xcite .",
    "however the cmbr is not completely isotropic . over the years",
    "many studies have reported power asymmetries and unlikely alignments of low multipoles @xcite .",
    "the asymmetries found in wmap were largely attributed to deficiencies in the foreground subtraction @xcite and non circularity of beams @xcite .",
    "however recent analysis of planck data by @xcite reported that the power asymmetry persist on scales corresponding to @xmath0 and the deviations from isotropy are at high statistical significance ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "a further analysis using multi frequency planck data by @xcite confirmed the power asymmetry and show that the foreground residuals are unlikely to affect these results .",
    "a multitude of other evidences favouring isotropy comes from isotropy in the angular distributions of radio sources @xcite , isotropy in the x - ray background @xcite , isotropy of gamma - ray bursts @xcite , isotropy in the distribution of galaxies @xcite , isotropy in the distribution of supernovae @xcite and isotropy in the distribution of neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "although large number of studies favour the statistical isotropy of the universe on large scales there is no clear consensus on this issue yet .",
    "there are some studies with type - ia supernovae which find evidence for statistically significant anisotropy @xcite .",
    "some other studies with radio sources @xcite and galaxy luminosity function @xcite also point towards significant anisotropy .",
    "these anisotropies may originate from the systematics in the data .",
    "but there is also a possibility that they signal the failure of the assumption of cosmic isotropy itself .",
    "there would be a major paradigm shift in modern cosmology if the assumption of cosmic isotropy is ruled out with high statistical significance by multiple data sets .",
    "a large number of theoretical studies have been carried out on the possible origins of such anisotropy and their consequences @xcite .",
    "different statistics @xcite has been developed to test isotropy for different types of data sets .",
    "@xcite introduce a method based on the shannon entropy @xcite for characterizing inhomogeneities in a 3d distribution of points and applied the method on some monte carlo simulations of inhomogeneous distributions and n - body simulations which show that the proposed method has great potential for testing the large scale homogeneity in galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "recently @xcite applied this method to galaxy distributions from sdss dr12 @xcite and find that the inhomogeneities in the galaxy distributions persist at least upto a length scale of @xmath2 .",
    "a subsequent analysis of the sdss lrg distribution @xcite by @xcite using an improved method reveal that the lrg distribution is homogeneous beyond length scales of @xmath3 . in the present work we propose a method for testing isotropy based on the shannon entropy .",
    "the proposed method can be directly applied to 3d distributions of galaxies or the corresponding density fields derived from them .",
    "the method can be also easily extended to 2d maps such as cmb and may be also suitably adapted for testing isotropy of gravitational waves , cosmic rays , x - ray or radio sky .    a brief outline of the paper follows .",
    "we describe our method in section 2 , describe the data and the tests in section 3 and present the results in section 4 and conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we have used a @xmath4cdm cosmological model with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 throughout .",
    "@xcite propose a method based on the shannon entropy to study inhomogeneities in a 3d distribution of points .",
    "shannon entropy @xcite is originally proposed by claude shannon to quantify the information loss while transmitting a message in a communication channel .",
    "it gives a measure of the amount of information required to describe a random variable .",
    "the shannon entropy for a discrete random variable x with @xmath8 outcomes @xmath9 is a measure of uncertainty denoted by @xmath10 defined as ,    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the probability distribution of the random variable x.    in the present work we propose information entropy as a measure of isotropy .",
    "we assume a set of points distributed in 3d and wish to test the assumption of statistical isotropy around any point . in order to test the isotropy around a point",
    "we first uniformly bin @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath14 are the polar angle and azimuthal angle in spherical polar co - ordinates respectively .",
    "uniform binning of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ensure equal size for each solid angle bin since @xmath16 .",
    "the number of bins @xmath17 and @xmath18 for binning @xmath13 and @xmath14 are to be decided conveniently . a given choice of @xmath17 and @xmath18 results in a total @xmath19 solid angle bins .",
    "we impose an upper limit to the radius @xmath20 upto which the isotropy is to be tested .",
    "there is a natural limit to @xmath20 from the fact that the data points are available only upto a certain radius @xmath21 .",
    "we pick up a point about which isotropy has to be tested and treating that point as origin define the coordinates of all the other points in the distribution .",
    "we bin the co - ordinates for a given choice of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "this results in @xmath19 volume elements each covering the same solid angle . for any given value of @xmath20",
    "each of the volume elements has the same radial extension ensuring same volume @xmath22 for each of them .",
    "we count the number of points @xmath23 inside each of the @xmath24 volume elements where @xmath25 is the index of the volume element . in general",
    "each galaxy within radius @xmath20 from the centre can reside in only one of the @xmath24 volume elements .",
    "but which volume element a particular galaxy belongs to ?",
    "the answer to this question has @xmath24 likely outcomes .",
    "we define a random variable @xmath26 which has @xmath24 possible outcomes each given by , @xmath27 with the constraint @xmath28 .",
    "the shannon entropy associated with the random variable @xmath26 can be written as , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total number of points within radius @xmath20 .",
    "the base of the logarithm is arbitrary and we choose it to be @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 will have the same value @xmath33 for all the volume elements when @xmath34 is same for all of them .",
    "this maximizes the shannon entropy to @xmath35 for a given choice of @xmath17,@xmath18 and any @xmath20 .",
    "we define the relative shannon entropy as the ratio of the entropy of a random variable @xmath26 to the maximum possible entropy @xmath36 associated with it .",
    "the relative shannon entropy @xmath37 then quantifies the degree of uncertainty in the knowledge of the random variable @xmath26 .",
    "equivalently @xmath38 quantify the residual information and can be treated as a measure of anisotropy .",
    "the fact that galaxies are not residing in any particular volume element and rather are distributed across all of them with different probabilities acts as a source of information .",
    "if all of them would have been residing in a particular volume element then there would be no uncertainty and no information at all making @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "this fully determined situation corresponds to maximum anisotropy . on the other hand",
    "when all the @xmath24 volume elements are populated with equal probabilities it would be most uncertain to decide which particular volume element a galaxy belongs to .",
    "this maximizes the information entropy to @xmath41 turning @xmath42 .",
    "this corresponds to a situation when the distribution is completely isotropic .",
    "the galaxy distribution is expected to be anisotropic on small scales but with increasing solid angle @xmath43 and radius @xmath20 one would expect it to be isotropic on some scale provided the cosmological principle holds on large scales .",
    "we change the value of @xmath20 starting from a small radius @xmath20 and gradually increase it in steps upto the maximum radius @xmath21 to study how @xmath44 varies with @xmath20 for a given choice of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it may be noted here that the analysis can be also done for data covering parts of the sky .",
    "we would like to mention here that the proposed measure of anisotropy would never be exactly zero and would be also sensitive to binning and sub - sampling .",
    "so we adopt a workable definition of isotropy where the distribution is considered to be isotropic when the measured anisotropy lies within the @xmath45 errorbars of the anisotropy expected for a poisson distribution .",
    "consequently our preferred binning and sampling would be such that for which the anisotropy in the poisson distribution decays to approximately zero within the scales probed .    besides the radial anisotropy one can also measure the degree of polar anisotropy @xmath46 and the azimuthal anisotropy @xmath47 as function of @xmath15 and @xmath14 by carrying out the sum respectively over @xmath18 or @xmath17 instead of @xmath24 in .",
    "note that in this case @xmath30 would be the total number of points inside all the @xmath18 or @xmath17 volume elements at different @xmath15 or @xmath14 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath48 measures isotropy among all the @xmath14 bins at each @xmath15 and similarly @xmath49 measures isotropy among all the @xmath15 bins at each @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 are then determined at different @xmath15 and @xmath14 values respectively .",
    "one can also study @xmath50 and @xmath51 as a function of @xmath20 at fixed @xmath15 and @xmath14 values respectively .",
    "however in the present work we only employ @xmath44 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 to quantify and characterize the anisotropies present in a distribution .    it would be worth mentioning here that one can also estimate the variance in the number counts across the various volume elements in different ( @xmath15,@xmath14 ) directions to measure the anisotropy present in a distribution .",
    "but we prefer entropy because unlike variance it is related to the higher order moments of a distribution .",
    "so in principle the entropy can be a better measure of non - uniformity than variance as it uses more information about the probability distribution .",
    "the variance and the entropy would be equivalent as a measure of non - uniformity only when the probability distribution is fully characterized by the first two moments such as in a gaussian distribution .",
    "however even all the higher order moments together can not uniquely describe a highly tailed distribution in the non - linear regime @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the spectrum of the log - density field carries more information than the spectrum of the field and could be a better choice in such cases @xcite .",
    "when the probability distribution function is gaussian then the associated shannon entropy is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the standard deviation of the distribution . in @xmath54 model",
    "one can use the variance of the smoothed density field predicted from the power spectrum to estimate the shannon entropy associated with that scale provided the density field is assumed to be gaussian .",
    "one can integrate @xmath55 for any probability distribution to estimate the associated differential entropy of the corresponding distribution .",
    "for example the differential entropy of the poisson distribution is given by , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the average number of events per interval .",
    "in this case @xmath57 is the average number of points per volume element .",
    "although the discrete entropy and differential entropy have similar mathematical forms there are some important differences between them .",
    "the differential entropy is not a number as in discrete entropy , but rather a function of one or more parameters that describes the associated probability distribution .",
    "the differential entropy does not provide the average amount of information contained in a random variable like its discrete counterpart .",
    "it is not an absolute measure of uncertainty rather it measures relative uncertainty or changes in uncertainty .",
    "one can show that the discrete entropy @xmath58 is related to the differential entropy @xmath59 as , @xmath60 in the limit @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the bin size used in discretization .",
    "the extra term @xmath63 approaches infinity as @xmath61 .",
    "so one can only make relative comparisons of differential entropies and a simple comparison between the discrete entropy and the differential entropy is not quite meaningful @xcite .",
    "the method presented here can be directly applied to different galaxy redshift surveys to test the isotropy of the galaxy distributions in the present universe .",
    "the redshift surveys map the mass distribution on a light cone time slice where the distribution does not evolve much over the light crossing time of the survey .",
    "but for very large galaxy surveys possible evolutionary effects can introduce signatures of anisotropy in the data .",
    "redshift dependent selection effects can also introduce artificial anisotropy in the data .",
    "besides these the redshift space distortions is one of the most important source of anisotropy in galaxy surveys . on large scales structures",
    "are compressed along the line of sight due to coherent flows into overdense regions and out of underdense regions whereas on small scales structures are elongated along the line of sight by random motions in virialized clusters .",
    "the volume elements used for measurement of @xmath34 in our method radially extends along the line of sight where the radial extension is much larger compared to their angular width .",
    "when measurements are done from the point from which observations are carried out one would expect uniformity in the measurement of @xmath34 across all directions for large @xmath20 provided the universe is isotropic . but",
    "this would appear anisotropic if one shifts the origin from the point of observation given such sources of anisotropies are present .",
    "it is important to distinguish the presence of genuine anisotropies from the artificial ones such as introduced by radial inhomogeneities ( due to selection effects , evolutionary effects ) and redshift space distortions .",
    "we will show that our method can distinguish the signatures of different kind of anisotropies present in the distribution .",
    "the method presented here has a significant advantage compared to the method proposed by @xcite for testing homogeneity using shannon entropy .",
    "the volume elements used for measuring the number count @xmath34 in this method do not overlap .",
    "consequently all the complexities due to overlap can be bypassed allowing one to have a more direct and clear interpretation .",
    "in order to study the prospects and limitations of the proposed method we carry out some preliminary tests by applying it to some simple distributions .",
    "we consider the following distributions : ( 1 ) homogeneous and isotropic poisson distributions , ( 2 ) anisotropic distributions generated by inserting pockets of different densities at different locations in homogeneous and isotropic poisson distributions , ( 3 ) radially inhomogeneous poisson distributions which are isotropic only about one point i.e. the centre and ( 4 ) simulated galaxy distributions from n - body simulations in real space and redshift space .",
    "for the first three types we generate a set of monte carlo realizations .",
    "the distributions of type ( 1 ) are isotropic and type ( 2 ) are anisotropic by construction .",
    "the distributions of type ( 3 ) are radially inhomogeneous and the radial variations are identical in all directions making them isotropic about the centre of the sphere .",
    "but if we shift the origin from the centre of the sphere the distribution would appear anisotropic and the degree of anisotropy would depend on the magnitude and direction of the shift in a predictable manner . for the distributions of type ( 4 ) we use the data from a semi analytic galaxy catalogue from the millennium simulation . an isotropic distribution in real space",
    "would appear anisotropic in redshift space due to redshift space distortions induced by the peculiar velocities .",
    "we map the particles in n - body simulations from real space to redshift space using their peculiar velocities and measure the resulting anisotropies induced by redshift space distortions . in all cases we have considered a spherical region of radius @xmath64 .",
    "we analyze the datasets separately using the method described in section 2 .",
    "we divide the @xmath65 space into @xmath66 solid angle bins where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are variables and chosen conveniently .",
    "the following calculations are carried out for each of the datasets described in the subsections below .",
    "\\(i ) we choose the minimum and maximum values of radius @xmath20 to be @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we gradually increase the radius @xmath20 in steps of @xmath69 from @xmath70 to @xmath21 and compute the shannon entropy @xmath71 for each radius using all the available @xmath66 bins .",
    "\\(ii ) we fix the radius at @xmath72 and compute @xmath73 for each @xmath15 using all the @xmath18 azimuthal bins available .",
    "\\(iii ) we fix the radius at @xmath74 and compute @xmath75 for each @xmath14 using all the @xmath17 polar bins available .",
    "\\(iv ) we shift the origin by @xmath76 along the x - axes without any rotation and repeat ( i),(ii ) and ( iii ) using @xmath77 .",

    "\\(vi ) we shift the origin by @xmath76 along the z - axes without any rotation and repeat ( i),(ii ) and ( iii ) using @xmath77 .",
    "in general one can apply the shift along any arbitrary directions and it would not make any difference given the distribution is isotropic . further if one can verify the isotropy around other points it would also help us in testing homogeneity of the distribution .",
    "the monte carlo simulations for the data sets of type ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) are generated by considering two simple radial density distributions @xmath78 where @xmath79 for type ( 1 ) and @xmath80 for type ( 3 ) distributions .",
    "here @xmath81 is a normalization constant .",
    "the type ( 1 ) distributions are homogeneous and isotropic poisson point process which has a constant density everywhere . the type ( 3 ) distributions are radially inhomogeneous poisson distributions which are isotropic only about the centre .",
    "enforcing the desired number of particles @xmath30 within radius @xmath82 one can turn the radial density function into a probability function within @xmath83 to @xmath84 which is normalized to one when integrated over that interval .",
    "so the probability of finding a particle at a given radius @xmath20 is @xmath85 which is proportional to the density at that radius implying more particles in high density regions .",
    "we generate the monte carlo realizations of these distributions using a monte carlo dartboard technique .",
    "the maxima of the function @xmath86 in @xmath87 is at @xmath84 for type ( 1 ) distribution whereas in type ( 3 ) distribution it is same and constant everywhere . we label the maximum value of @xmath87 as @xmath88 .",
    "we randomly choose a radius @xmath20 in the range @xmath89 and a probability value is randomly chosen in the range @xmath90 .",
    "the actual probability of finding a particle at the selected radius is then calculated using expression for @xmath87 and compared to the randomly selected probability value .",
    "if the random probability is less than the calculated value , the radius is accepted and assigned isotropically selected angular co - ordinates @xmath15 and @xmath14 , otherwise the radius is discarded . in this way ,",
    "radii at which particle is more likely to be found will be selected more often because the random probability will be more frequently less than the calculated actual probability .",
    "we choose @xmath91 and @xmath92 .    to generate the distributions of type ( 2 ) we first generate a homogeneous and isotropic poisson distribution within a spherical region of radius @xmath74 with @xmath92 .",
    "we randomly identify a region in @xmath93 space assuming the centre of the sphere as origin .",
    "we discard all the data points from the selected region and subsequently populate it with a homogeneous and isotropic poisson distribution having a different intensity parameter than the original one . as a result this region will have a different mean density which introduces a preferred direction and hence anisotropy in the distribution .",
    "we generate @xmath31 realizations for each of the above density distributions and analyze them separately using the method described earlier .",
    "semi analytic models @xcite provide a very powerful tool to study galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "galaxy formation and evolution involve many physical processes such as gas cooling , star formation , supernovae feedback , metal enrichment , merging and morphological evolution .",
    "the semi analytic models parametrise the physics involved in terms of simple models following the dark matter merger trees over time .",
    "the models provide the statistical predictions of galaxy properties at some epoch and the precision of these predictions are directly related to the accuracy of the input physics . in the present work we use a semi - analytic galaxy catalogue generated by @xcite from the millennium run simulation@xcite who updated the previously available galaxy formation models",
    "@xcite with improved versions .",
    "the spectra and magnitude of the model galaxies were computed using population synthesis models of @xcite .",
    "we place the origin at the centre of the simulation box which has a length of @xmath94 on each side and then identify all the galaxies within a radius of @xmath64 having r - band petrosian absolute magnitude in the range @xmath95 .",
    "we randomly select @xmath96 galaxies from them to construct the simulated galaxy sample in real space for our analysis .",

    "next we consider only the set of distributions where the pocket is filled with a homogeneous and isotropic poisson distribution having density twice than that of the original one .",
    "we again separately measure anisotropies as a function of @xmath20 , @xmath15 and @xmath14 from multiple points of observation inside the distribution .",
    "we shift the origin along x , y and z directions by @xmath76 without any rotation of the axes to have three different point of observations .",
    "we compare our findings in the top right , middle right and bottom right panels of . in the top right panel of we show the anisotropy as a function of @xmath20 for the cases where the centre is shifted along x , y or z directions or not shifted at all .",
    "we find that the variations in anisotropy are identical in all cases except when the origin is shifted along y direction .",
    "this is due to the fact that the geometry of the pocket ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) does not affect the measurements in any of these cases other than when the shift is applied along y direction .",
    "this shows the existence of a preferred direction which clearly violates isotropy .",
    "this becomes even clearer in the right middle and right bottom panels of . in the right middle panel",
    "we see that a bump appears between @xmath113 to @xmath114 when the centre is not shifted .",
    "the pocket radially spans from @xmath125 and hence overlaps with the current measurement producing an anisotropy signal in the appropriate range of @xmath15 . on the other hand",
    "the pocket is completely excluded from the measurements when the centre is shifted along x or z directions showing a near uniform very small signal of anisotropy for all @xmath15 values .",
    "this small signal of anisotropy arises due to the poisson noise resulting simply from the reduction in the radial extensions of the volume elements used in the measurements .",
    "but when we shift the origin along y direction by @xmath76 the measurements include major part of the pocket showing anisotropy in the relevant range of @xmath15 .",
    "as there are no rotations of the axes , the bump appears exactly at @xmath126 irrespective of whether the centre is shifted along y direction or not shifted at all . but the shifted position of the origin redefines the geometry of the pocket which changes the upper limit of @xmath15 for the pocket when the centre is shifted along y direction .",
    "we see very similar results in the right bottom panel of where anisotropies are shown as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "we again find presence of bumps over the appropriate range of @xmath14 values when the centre is shifted along y directions or not shifted at all whereas the distribution appears to be isotropic when the origin is shifted along x or z directions .",
    "these differences clearly indicate the presence of anisotropies in the distribution .",
    "the error - bars shown here in all the panels are the @xmath45 variations from the @xmath31 monte carlo realizations used in each case .    for the inhomogeneous poisson distributions the density only varies radially as @xmath127 from the centre .",
    "this preserves the isotropy of the distribution about the centre but isotropy is violated for all other points .",
    "we want to test if our method can capture these expected behaviours for such distributions .",
    "the results are shown in different panels of .",
    "in top left panel we show the anisotropy as a function of radial distance @xmath20 when the origin is located at the centre of the spherical volume .",
    "when we compare the anisotropy in the homogeneous and radially inhomogeneous poisson distributions we find that the former shows a higher degree of anisotropy than the later .",
    "the inhomogeneous poisson distribution considered here has a radial variation in density as @xmath127 from the centre . as a result",
    "the number density of points are significantly higher at smaller radii in the inhomogeneous poisson distribution as compared to the homogeneous one .",
    "this leads to significant reduction in the poisson noise at smaller radii where it is considered to be more dominant . at larger radii",
    "the situation would be just opposite but as the number counts are cumulative in our method the distribution would remain isotropic as expected despite the radial decrease in density . in the middle left and bottom left panels of we show the anisotropies as function of @xmath15 and @xmath14 respectively . in both cases we have used @xmath72 .",
    "we find that as expected the distributions are found to be highly isotropic from the centre .",
    "the top right panel of shows the anisotropies as a function of @xmath20 when the origins are shifted from the centre by @xmath76 along x or y or z direction .",
    "we see a large anisotropy at smaller radii which decreases with increasing radii due to the relative increase in the number counts and again increases afterwards due to large disparity in the density at the central and peripheral regions .",
    "the variations in anisotropies are identical when the origin is shifted from the centre along x , y or z directions due to the identical variations in density along all radial directions but they are noticeably different from the results obtained without shifting the origin from the centre .",
    "this demonstrates the anisotropic nature of the distribution .",
    "the middle right panel of show the anisotropies as a function of @xmath15 when the origin is shifted in various directions .",
    "it is interesting to note that when we shift the origin along z direction the distribution appears to be isotropic in @xmath15 as it would appear without any shift at all .",
    "the relative shannon entropy is measured across all the @xmath14 bins at each @xmath15 values .",
    "the polar angle @xmath15 is defined with respect to the z axis and all the @xmath14 bins at a specific @xmath15 value are located at the same distance from the centre .",
    "since the density only changes in the radial directions the distribution would appear isotropic in all @xmath14 directions for each @xmath15 when the origin is shifted in the z direction .",
    "the situations are not analogous when the origin is shifted in the x or y direction . in both the cases different @xmath14 bins at any given @xmath15 value",
    "are located at different distances from the centre leading to variations in their densities .",
    "this is true for all @xmath15 values albeit with a different degree of variation .",
    "the degree of variation across all the @xmath14 bins is expected to peak at @xmath126 as it would encompass largest variation in the radial distances among the @xmath14 bins .",
    "interestingly our method capture these predictable behaviours of anisotropies as a function of @xmath15 quite well .    finally in the bottom right panel of we",
    "show the anisotropies as a function of @xmath14 . here",
    "we estimate the relative shannon entropy utilizing the information across all the @xmath15 bins at each @xmath14 values . when the origin is shifted in z direction the azimuthal angle @xmath14 is redefined in the shifted x - y plane which lies at a fixed distance @xmath76 from the centre .",
    "consequently different @xmath15 bins at any given @xmath14 value are at different distances from the centre leading to variations in their densities but the degree of variations across the different @xmath15 bins for each @xmath14 value would be exactly same as the @xmath15 bins cover same variations in their radial distances . in the bottom right panel",
    "we see a constant degree of anisotropy across all the @xmath14 values when the origin is shifted along z direction . on the other hand when the origin is shifted along x or y direction the available @xmath15 bins at each @xmath14 value",
    "are located at different distances from the centre . as a result",
    "the different @xmath15 bins at each @xmath14 values would exhibit different number density depending on their distances from the centre .",
    "but the degree of variations would not be same for all the @xmath14 bins as it depends both on the distance range covered by the corresponding @xmath15 bins as well as if those @xmath15 bins lie towards or away from the centre .",
    "clearly these variations are expected to peak at @xmath128 and @xmath129 for shift along x and y directions respectively .",
    "we exactly recover these predictable behaviours in the bottom right panel .",
    "differences in the anisotropies with shifts and without shift clearly indicate that the distribution is anisotropic in nature .",
    "these results together indicate that our method is not only able to sense the anisotropies but also can capture the nature of anisotropies present in a distribution .    in",
    "we investigate the anisotropies resulting from the redshift space distortions using a semi analytic galaxy catalogue from the millennium run simulation . in the top left panel of this figure",
    "we compare the anisotropies as a function of radius @xmath20 for the simulated galaxy distributions in real and redshift space .",
    "both distributions show anisotropies on small scales which partly arise due to inevitable poisson noise .",
    "the degree of anisotropy gradually decreases with increasing radii .",
    "noticeably at smaller radii the degree of anisotropy in both the distributions are higher as compared to a homogeneous and isotropic poisson distribution indicating the presence of additional sources of anisotropy other than the poisson noise .",
    "we see that on smaller radii the redshift space distribution of the simulated galaxies are more anisotropic than its real space counterpart .",
    "this is most likely caused due to the elongation of virialized clusters , compression of large scale overdensities and elongation of large scale underdensities along the line of sight in redshift space .",
    "the results clearly indicate that distribution of galaxies inside the cosmic web is not isotropic even in real space and redshift space distortions only enhance these anisotropies further .",
    "the differences between the real space and redshift space anisotropies cease to exist beyond @xmath130 and both the anisotropies become almost indistinguishable from that observed in homogeneous and isotropic poisson distributions at @xmath131",
    ". it may be worth mentioning here that in an earlier work @xcite we find that observed galaxy distribution in the sdss dr12 appears to be homogeneous on scales above @xmath117 . in the middle left and bottom left panels of we",
    "show the anisotropies as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath14 respectively . in both these panels",
    "we find that the real and redshift space distributions are equally isotropic in @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "a small signal of anisotropy exist for both real and redshift space distributions of the simulated galaxies which separates them from identical homogeneous and isotropic poisson distributions .",
    "the real and redshift space distributions demonstrate equal degree of isotropy both in @xmath15 and @xmath14 due to the fact that the compression and elongation of overdense and underdense regions are symmetric along the line of sight .",
    "we use @xmath132 for all the results shown in all the panels on left of .",
    "now we shift the origin from the centre along the x or y or z axis by @xmath76 in the redshift space distribution of the simulated galaxies .",
    "the resulting anisotropies as a function of @xmath20 , @xmath15 and @xmath14 are shown in the top right , middle right and bottom right panels of respectively .",
    "we see in the top right panel of that the observed anisotropies change at smaller radii when the origin is shifted along x , y or z directions than when it is not shifted .",
    "this tells us that the distribution is anisotropic under such shifts . in the middle right and bottom right panels we show the anisotropies in analogous situations but as functions of @xmath15 and @xmath14 respectively",
    "the results in these panels show that the resulting anisotropies under such shifts and without shift appears to be similar when measured as functions of @xmath15 and @xmath14 whereas the level of anisotropies are expected to be different in this case when the origin is shifted from the centre .",
    "the top right panel of agrees quite well with this expected behaviour but the middle right and bottom right panels do not exhibit these differences .",
    "the redshift space distortions are caused by the radial component of peculiar velocities which distorts the structures along the line of sight .",
    "the method presented here may not be able to capture the anisotropies imprinted in the details of distortions when looked in the polar and azimuthal directions as we are currently using only the number counts within the solid angle bins which radially extends upto @xmath21 .",
    "using the correlation functions instead of number counts may prove to be a better bet here .",
    "we present an information theory based method for testing isotropy in a three dimensional distribution and test the method on some monte carlo simulations of isotropic and anisotropic distributions .",
    "we find that our method can effectively identify and characterize various types of anisotropies and distinguish between them .",
    "we insert pockets of different densities inside homogeneous and isotropic distributions and find that the proposed method can effectively quantify the degree of the resulting anisotropy and also determine the geometry of the pockets introduced .",
    "we also consider spherically symmetric radially inhomogeneous distributions and find that such anisotropy can be easily characterized by our method .",
    "we then study the anisotropies induced by the redshift space distortions by using a semi analytic galaxy catalogue from the millennium simulation and find that the method can separate such anisotropies from a general one .",
    "but in general the distributions could be much more complex specially when the observed anisotropy results from different possible combinations of various types of anisotropies .",
    "disentangling such anisotropies is no doubt would be quite challenging .",
    "however our method could serve the purpose of detecting anisotropies quite well . in future",
    "we plan to analyze data from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to test the assumption of isotropy in the present universe .",
    "one may also extend the present method in fourier space . in this case one",
    "requires to estimate the pdf of the fourier mode amplitudes in different volume elements and then apply the anisotropy measures presented here . alternatively one can compute the kullback - leibler divergence of the pdf of the fourier mode amplitudes across the various volume elements to identify and assess any power asymmetry .",
    "one may also quantify the phase entropy by defining an information entropy on the set of fourier phases in different hemispheres and then compare the information content across different hemispheres .",
    "the degree of non - uniformity in the level of phase information could be used as a measure of anisotropy in this case .",
    "an important caveat in the present method arises from the tiling strategy adopted here .",
    "the @xmath65 scheme that we have implemented here ensure identical sizes for all the volume elements but they do not have identical shapes which make the prediction of anisotropy difficult in general .",
    "a healpix tessellation @xcite would be more appropriate and useful while analyzing observations .",
    "we plan to incorporate the healpix scheme into our method in its future applications to galaxy surveys .",
    "the proposed method can be also applied in many problems in cosmology which requires tests of isotropy .",
    "for example it can be used to investigate the issues like the anisotropic distribution of galactic satellites @xcite and anisotropic distribution of subhalos inside dark matter halos and the cosmic web @xcite .",
    "the method can be also used further to test for any hemispherical asymmetry in the angular distribution of galaxy clusters @xcite and gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "finally we note that the method presented here has the desired ability to identify and characterize any signals of anisotropy present in a distribution and it can be also suitably adapted for different types of datasets from other cosmological observations to efficiently explore the issue of cosmic isotropy .",
