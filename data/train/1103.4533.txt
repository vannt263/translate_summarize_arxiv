    "in spite of a prolonged and intensive research activity on the ferroelectric perovskite pbzr@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath7 ( also called pzt @xmath10 ) and related compounds , unsettled issues remain on its phase diagram and on the microscopic mechanisms that make it the most used piezoceramic material in many applications . the highest electromechanical coupling is obtained at compositions @xmath11 , near the morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) , which separates the rhombohedral ( r ) from the tetragonal ( t ) region in the @xmath12 phase diagram @xcite . for decades",
    "such a high electromechanical coupling had been attributed to a coexistence of r and t domains near the mpb , with consequent ease for polarisation to change direction through domain switching or domain wall motion . in 1999",
    "_ @xcite found that below the mpb of pzt 52/48 the structure is monoclinic ( m ) , intermediate between r and t. this discovery stimulated extensive investigations to better characterize such an intermediate phase , where the direction of the polarisation can in principle rotate continuously between the t @xmath13 and r @xmath14 directions ; this provides an appealing explanation to the enhanced ease for polarisation to change direction under an external stress or electric field at the mpb . yet",
    ", there is no consensus on the nature and even existence of the m phase , with a range of alternatives from its existence as uniform phase in a narrow composition range , the coexistence with the r phase in a broader range , or actually a fine mixture of r and t domains or finely twinned r domains behaving on the average as monoclinic .",
    "the debate has been recently reviewed @xcite , and involves the mechanisms of rotation and switching of the polarisation .",
    "the situation is confused also on the zr - rich end of the phase diagram , where the ferroelectric r  phase approaches the antiferroelectric orthorhombic one . here",
    "electron , but not neutron or x - ray , diffraction experiments reveal superlattice peaks incompatible with the r structure , variously attributed to rotations of the o octahedra @xcite or to antiferroelectric - like cation displacements away from the average @xmath15 direction @xcite .    structural studies in these critical composition ranges face the problem of analysing structures of domains with very short coherence lengths and possibly of different coexisting phases , so that information from other techniques , although not providing direct information on the cell symmetry , may prove useful in clarifying some issues .",
    "we present anelastic and dielectric spectroscopy measurements , which provide new insight in these debates , and we attempt to rationalize the phase diagram of pzt  regarding the tendency of the o octahedra to tilt .",
    "the ceramic samples of pbzr@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath7 , with ti fractions @xmath16 , 0.14 , 0.17 , _ _",
    "_ _ 0.42 , 0.45 , 0.452 ,  have been prepared similarly to a previous study @xcite with higher values of @xmath17 ( 0.455 , 0.465 , 0.48 and 0.53 ) , with the mixed - oxide method .",
    "the starting oxide powders were calcined at 800  @xmath18c for 4 hours ( 700  @xmath18c for @xmath16 ) , pressed into bars and sintered at 1250  @xmath18c for 2  h , packed with pbzro@xmath7  + 5wt% excess zro@xmath19  in order to maintain a constant pbo activity during sintering .",
    "the powder x - ray diffractograms did not show any trace of impurity phases and the densities were about 95% of the theoretical ones .",
    "the sintered blocks were cut into thin bars @xmath20 cm long and @xmath21  mm thick , whose major surfaces were made conducting with ag paint .",
    "the dielectric susceptibility @xmath22 was measured with a hp 4194 a impedance bridge with a four wire probe and an excitation of 0.5 v / mm , between 0.2 and 500  khz .",
    "the heating and cooling runs were made at @xmath23  k / min between room temperature and 540  k in a delta climatic chamber .",
    "the mechanical analogue of the dielectric susceptibility is the elastic compliance @xmath24 , which was obtained as the reciprocal of the dynamic young s modulus @xmath25 .",
    "it was measured between 100 and 750  k by electrostatically exciting the flexural modes of the bars suspended in vacuum on thin thermocouple wires @xcite . during a same run the first three odd flexural vibrations",
    "could be tested , whose frequencies are in the ratios @xmath26 .",
    "the fundamental resonance angular frequency is nb72 @xmath27 , and the temperature variation of the real part of the compliance is given by @xmath28 @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is chosen so that @xmath31 represents the compliance in the paraelectric phase .",
    "the imaginary parts of the susceptibilities contribute to the losses , which are presented as @xmath32 for the mechanical case and @xmath33 for the dielectric one .",
    "figure [ fig an1hc ] presents the anelastic spectrum of pzt 90/10 .",
    "the peak in both real and imaginary parts of the compliance at @xmath35  k , with 1.6  k hysteresis between heating and cooling , signals the transition between cubic paraelectric and ferroelectric phase , while the anomaly at @xmath36  k with an hysteresis of 1  k corresponds to the transition from the rhombohedral @xmath37 ( r ) to the tilted @xmath38 ( r@xmath39 ) phase , often labelled as r@xmath40 and r@xmath41 respectively .",
    "these temperatures fall exactly on the well known phase diagram of pzt , as shown in figure [ fig pd ] below .",
    "there is however an additional broad step in @xmath42 , without any counterpart in @xmath43 , at the temperature @xmath44  k , which we identify as the onset of an intermediate tilt pattern of the octahedra , before the final tilt pattern develops below @xmath6 .",
    "a signature of this new transition is present also in the dielectric susceptibility as a broad step in @xmath45 and a hardly discernible hump in @xmath46 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig diel ] , together with the anomalies at @xmath47 and @xmath6 .",
    "the dashed arrows in figure [ fig diel ] are the transition temperatures deduced from the anelastic spectra in figure [ fig an1hc ] .",
    "the elastic compliance is peaked at a somewhat lower temperature than the dielectric susceptibility at the ferroelectric transition , as already observed @xcite , and the same is true for the tilt transition , but it should be noted that since the two susceptibilities are differently coupled to the order parameter , the shapes of their anomalies have to be different from each other .        in order to check that there is indeed a structural transformation at @xmath48 , we verified that the step in @xmath49 is independent of the measuring frequency @xmath50 , temperature rate and polarisation state .",
    "in fact , the susceptibility curves may be affected by various processes , especially in the presence of strong domain wall relaxations , as is the case below the ferroelectric transition . when the temperature rate is such that the domain configuration is kept far from equilibrium ,",
    "the susceptibility curve generally drops when the temperature rate is decreased and partial aging proceeds .",
    "this occurs also in certain temperature and composition ranges of pzt , where marked irregularities may be induced in the @xmath51 curves by varying the temperature rate .",
    "we will not discuss such phenomena , and only mention that they can be reduced by keeping the temperature rate as constant and low as possible , and their amplitude is larger at lower measuring frequency .",
    "k / min , 1.8 khz ; @xmath52 @xmath53 : subsequent run slowed down to 0.13  k / min above @xmath54  k ( dashed vertical line ) measured at @xmath55 1.8 , 9.7 and 24  khz.,width=8 ]    figure [ fig anrate ] shows that the anomaly at @xmath5 is instead perfectly reproducible and independent of all these variables .",
    "curve 1 ( dashed ) was measured in the initially polarised state of the sample , obtained by application of 3  kv / mm  at 120  @xmath18c for 40  min .",
    "the temperature rate was + 1.3  k / min , except near @xmath6 , where it was lowered to 0.8  k / min in order to get enough accurate and closely spaced data points ; the run was extended up to 580  k , hence loosing the polarisation .",
    "curve 2 ( solid ) is the subsequent heating run at @xmath56  k / min .",
    "the imaginary part is always above the previous run both because of the higher density of relaxing domain walls in the unpoled state , and because at the higher temperature rate such walls are more out of equilibrium .",
    "yet , the real parts are practically coincident until @xmath57  k , where they start slowly departing from each other due to the increasing influence of the ferroelectric domain wall relaxation .",
    "the other three curves ( empty circles ) were measured during the third heating run at @xmath58  k / min until @xmath57  k and 0.13  k / min above that temperature ; the frequencies are @xmath59  khz , @xmath60  khz and @xmath61  khz .",
    "the important point is that both steps at @xmath6 and @xmath5 are practically the same in all the @xmath62 curves .",
    "this is true also for the peak in @xmath43 at @xmath63 , while the differences in the @xmath64 curves at higher temperature and particularly the drop when the rate is lowered to 0.13  k / min have to be attributed to the tail of the domain wall relaxations below @xmath47 .",
    "there is an additional peak or kink around 445/460  k in the @xmath64 curves , which does not appear to be connected with anomalies in the real part and will be ignored .",
    "the lack of a peak in @xmath43 at @xmath5 and the independence on frequency of the step in @xmath65also exclude that the anomaly is caused by relaxation of any type of defects .",
    "figure [ fig anrate ] therefore demonstrates that at the origin of the anomaly at @xmath48 there  is a somewhat broadened but otherwise well behaved phase transformation .",
    "we will consider @xmath5 as the temperature of the upper edge of the rounded step in @xmath66 , analogously to @xmath6 , where the assignment is corroborated by the neat peak in @xmath67 .",
    "ti@xmath1o@xmath7 with @xmath68 measured at 1.8  khz during heating.,width=8 ]    in order to draw a @xmath5  line in the phase diagram , we also measured the two concentrations @xmath69  and 0.17 , whose compliances are plotted together with that of @xmath70  in figure [ fig4 ] . the step at @xmath63  shifts to higher temperature according to the usual phase diagram , though it acquires a peaked component , particularly evident at @xmath71 , while the broader step at @xmath5  shifts to lower temperature merging with @xmath6 .",
    "that an anomaly exists for @xmath72  around 430  k is evident by comparing with the curve of @xmath73 .",
    "both curves are practically coincident above 470  k and run parallel to each other below the step at @xmath6 , but the @xmath69  curve has a clear bump indicated by the arrow , whose precise shape is however difficult to evaluate .",
    "an even more attenuated anomaly might exist also for @xmath73 , even closer to @xmath6 , but it is not actually distinguishable .",
    "ti@xmath1o@xmath7 with @xmath74 0.42 , 0.455 , 0.48 and 0.53 measured at @xmath75  khz .",
    "the vertical lines mark @xmath76 , while the arrows the relaxation r@xmath19 ( the three highest @xmath77 are from reference @xcite).,width=8 ]    the measurements on the samples at higher ti content are similar to those already published @xcite and a selection of them , including some from reference @xcite , is presented in figure [ fig ttvsx ] . with increasing @xmath17 ,",
    "the anomaly at @xmath6 , marked by vertical lines ,  becomes more diffuse and the spike in @xmath43 gradually transforms into a step of increasing amplitude , at least until it occurs into the r / m phase , when @xmath78 .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of a diffuse tilt transition by neutron diffraction in pzt 60/40 @xcite .",
    "the step in @xmath62 , instead , decreases its amplitude and becomes hardly visible due to the peak at @xmath79 .",
    "the latter has been attributed to the ability of the polarisation to continuously rotate in the m phase between the t and r directions @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the anomaly at @xmath80 is also hindered by a broad peak in the losses around @xmath81  k , labelled r@xmath19 in reference @xcite , and whose frequency dispersion indicates a relaxational origin rather than a phase transformation .",
    "it appears also as a frequency - dependent hump in @xmath42 and is indicated by arrows in figure [ fig ttvsx ] ( the dependence on frequency is not shown ) .",
    "the curves with @xmath82 0.45 , 0.452 , 0.455 and 0.465 are very similar to each other , with @xmath6 signaled by a weak step in @xmath83 and a small cusp in @xmath67 , which at first appear as qualitatively different from the clear step in @xmath43 at @xmath84 . the difference in the @xmath67 curves , however , may be less important than it appears , because one must take into account the maximum r@xmath19 , which looses importance with respect to the spike / peak at @xmath76 on approaching the mpb .",
    "it is therefore possible that , if one were able to decompose the curves into the two contributions , r@xmath19 and the anomaly at @xmath6 , the latter would result as a broadened step already at @xmath85 .",
    "figure [ fig pd ] , presents the commonly accepted phase diagram of pzt jcj71,nc06 ( solid lines ) together with the points deduced from our anelastic spectra , including those of reference @xcite ; the dashed lines pass through our data and are drawn as explained in the following paragraphs , but further measurements are necessary in order to confirm their exact shape .",
    "the new anelastic and dielectric experiments presented here contain essentially two results : the existence of a novel phase transformation at @xmath5 below @xmath86 and the confirmation that there is a perfect continuity of the @xmath8 line of the onset of octahedral tilting up to the mpb , while @xmath6 in the t phase is lower than the extrapolation from the mpb .",

    "yzt09 it is established that in ceramic samples the r and m phases coexist over the whole composition range from the orthorhombic ( o ) phase to the mpb , with the fraction of m phase increasing toward the mpb .",
    "the actual relative fraction of the two phases , and some details of the atomic displacements depend on the preparation technique and a pure r phase can be obtained in single crystals , only available at @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is considerable debate about the role of the short length scale of the t , r and m domains near the mpb @xcite and of the high density of domain boundaries or microtwinning of the r domains , that may constitute an adaptive phase with the average properties attributed to the m phase @xcite .",
    "first principle calculations do not solve the issue , since in some studies a stable monoclinic ground state is found @xcite but in other cases is excluded @xcite .    in our data",
    "there is no sign of an r / m border , at least within the interval @xmath108 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath8 line is perfectly continuous within that interval , and the anelastic spectra exhibit a smooth evolution from @xmath109 to @xmath110 and probably also 0.48 , as discussed in the explanation of figure [ fig ttvsx ] .",
    "moreover , the anelastic spectra do not have any sign of an additional m / r phase transition , expected if the m / r border existed for @xmath111 and were not vertical , as in the theoretical phase diagram obtained from first - principle calculations @xcite .",
    "for all these reasons we labelled the region to the left of the mpb as r+m , adopting the view of yokota _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite of a mixture of rhombohedral @xmath37 and monoclinic @xmath91 phases , both with untilted octahedra .",
    "when discussing the @xmath16 composition , however , we will for simplicity refer to the r phase only , which certainly predominates over the m one .",
    "of course , the absence of a m / r boundary is natural in the hypothesis that the m phase is actually the average of an adaptive microtwinned r phase .",
    "the different conclusions of the various analyses based on thermodynamic approaches and first principle calculations probably reflect the fact that the border between a true m phase and an adaptive one is indeed vague .",
    "the mpb is the locus in the phase diagram where the anisotropy of the free energy changes over from stabilizing the r phase to the t phase .",
    "the main anisotropic term in the landau expansion in terms of powers of the polarisation * p * is @xmath112 or its complementary @xmath113 , with extrema in the @xmath114 or @xmath115 directions , depending on the sign , which stabilize the r or t phase .",
    "including terms of the sixth order , the anisotropy acquires extrema also along directions stabilizing the o phase , while it is necessary to include eighth order terms in order to stabilize the m phase @xcite . at the mpb the anisotropic term of fourth order changes sign and",
    "therefore vanishes @xcite : the material is isotropic with respect to polarisation , at least up to the fourth order in * p , * and one has a transversal or rotational instability of * p * @xcite accompanied by divergence of the transversal dielectric susceptibility and some enhancement of the corresponding shear compliance @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "a divergence of the compliance can be obtained at the transition between t and o phase , including the sixth order terms @xcite , but this is not the case of pzt , which does not have a o phase at the mpb .",
    "the theoretical expressions of the compliances from an expansion of the free energy up to the eighth order are certainly cumbersome , but it is not necessary to work them out in order to establish that a divergence of @xmath116 is expected also at the t / m border .",
    "in fact , we argued @xcite that in the case that a m phase exists in which * p * can continuously tilt from the t to the r directions with little change of the magnitude , the rotation angle from the original t direction acts as order parameter @xcite and is almost linearly coupled to the strains of symmetry @xmath117 ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 in voigt notation ) , thereby causing a divergence in the respective compliance @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we interpreted the maximum in the compliance at the mpb , particularly pronounced at @xmath110 , as due to this rotational instability in the m phase @xcite .",
    "the main arguments against a true m phase are that it is very unlikely that pzt is so anharmonic to require terms up to the eight power of * p * in the expansion of the free energy @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the real structure should be r , but with fine twinning thanks to the near isotropy at the mpb , which lowers the energy of the domain walls .",
    "such an adaptive phase , analogous to the heavily twinned phases in martensites , would produce diffraction patterns easily confused with a homogeneous m phase and would also cause extrinsic softening @xcite .",
    "the first part of the argument is certainly convincing for an ideal homogeneous crystal , but pzt has both quenched strain fields from the cation disorder @xcite and also internal fields from the domain configuration , which presents particularly wavy and strained walls in the r phase @xcite . while these microstructure and internal strains may let the diffraction patterns of the r phase appear as an homogeneous m phase",
    ", they also modify the local anisotropy , acting as higher order terms in the free energy expansion and stabilizing an m phase @xcite .",
    "we would therefore expect that there are regions where a real m phase is formed , although with cell parameters and direction of the polarisation dependent on the local field .",
    "a border between a mixed m+r @xcite and a polar glass state @xcite is probably impossible to establish , and the balance between the two descriptions may also depend on the sample preparation and microstructure , not to mention whether the sample is bulk ceramic or thinned for electron microscopy .    here",
    "we would like to point out an aspect that distinguishes between m , not necessarily homogeneous , and microtwinned adaptive r phase and is overlooked in the debate : the dynamics .",
    "in fact , an adaptive phase with high density of domain walls having vanishing energies causes extrinsic softening @xcite , but we are not aware of a detailed theory of its frequency and temperature dependence .",
    "we would expect an important contribution of relaxational nature , with a consequent dependence on frequency , and possibly also nonlinear response , none of which we observe @xcite .",
    "certainly a complicated and fine domain structure exists , and it may well be at the origin of the nonlinear stress - strain response of pzt @xcite , but the elastic response to low amplitude excitation that we measure is strictly linear and almost frequency independent .",
    "again , the border between extrinsic softening from fine twinning and intrinsic linear softening due to a rotational instability may be blurry , since the vanishing of the orientational free energy barrier brings about a crossover from thermally activated , characteristic of domain walls , to almost athermal dynamics , but the peak in @xmath42 at @xmath79 is more characteristic of the latter .      from the present experiments we are not able to establish whether the tilting transition affects both m and r  domains in the same manner or not , because we are not able yet to interpret the evolution of the shape and amplitude of the anomaly at @xmath6 with varying @xmath17 ( figure [ fig ttvsx ] ) , whose analysis is also made difficult by the relaxation r@xmath19 ( figure [ fig ttvsx ] ) .",
    "we would like to stress the different origin of the hump corresponding to r@xmath121 with respect to the anomalies at @xmath6 and @xmath5 , since they all appear similar in the @xmath66 curves , and it may be tempting to identify r@xmath19 as another structural transition , for example tilts in the m phase instead of the r phase .",
    "a more careful examination , however , indicates that this is not the case .",
    "the anomalies at @xmath76 and @xmath5 have all the characteristics of well behaved , though diffuse , structural transformations , as described above and in reference @xcite for @xmath6 : they are perfectly reproducible during heating and cooling , and are independent of frequency and temperature rate . instead , r@xmath19 has none of these characteristics : its amplitude is larger at lower frequency and strongly depends on the temperature rate ( data not shown here ) , so that we attribute it to kinetic effects of the rearranging ferroelectric domain walls or adaptive microtwins , rather than to a phase transformation .",
    "a  final argument against the involvement of octahedral tilts in the relaxation r@xmath19 is that it is observed also in the t phase just below @xmath122  k ( curve @xmath123 in figure [ fig ttvsx ] ) , where tilting has never been observed .",
    "the tilted tetragonal phase is predicted to have @xmath89  space group , based on first - principle calculations @xcite and recent neutron diffraction observations @xcite . a cell doubling transition in the t  phase , possibly due to an octahedral anti - phase rotation ,",
    "was proposed by ragini _",
    "@xcite , after the observation in pzt 48/52 of superlattice peaks below 189  k and anomalies in the dielectric @xmath46  and resonance frequency , but the temperature of such anomalies is definitely higher than the @xmath6  we found at the same composition @xcite .",
    "we can not exclude that the technique of sample preparation has an influence on the position of the @xmath8  line in the high @xmath17  region , considering that it may affect the fraction of r and m phases @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig pd ] we drew the @xmath8line straight until the mpb and then again straight with a higher slope in order to interpolate the only available point in the t phase ( dashed line ) .",
    "such a kink at the mpb is not actually observed ; it might be either smoother or a more discontinuous step and future work is necessary in order to clarify this point .",
    "the occurrence of tilting transitions of the bo@xmath124 octahedra is an extremely common phenomenon in abo@xmath7 perovskites , and it has been rationalized in terms of the tolerance factor @xcite@xmath125which is 1 if the mean ionic radii , usually taken from shannon s tables @xcite , exactly match the a - o and b - o lengths in a cubic cell . when @xmath126 , the b - o bond is too long with respect to the a - o one ; hence the a - o - a network exerts a compression over the network of octahedra , which rotate in order to accommodate the mismatch while keeping the b - o bonds long .",
    "the a - o bonds are @xmath127 longer and therefore are weaker and have larger thermal expansion than the b - o bonds ; therefore @xmath128 always decreases on cooling , and when it drops below a critical value , within the interval @xmath129 for most perovskites @xcite , a tilting transition occurs .",
    "the tolerance factor can also be decreased in a solid solution by increasing the mean ionic radius in the b  sublattice or decreasing that in the a sublattice . moreover",
    ", a sequence of tilting transitions may occur with proceeding cooling and/or changing of the ionic radii , usually through more symmetrical tilt patterns first , like rhombohedral @xmath101 , and then to the more distorted orthorhombic patterns @xcite .",
    "this framework is widely adopted to explain the phase diagrams of all types of perovskites with chemical substitutions , including the ferroelectric ones wkr05,rcs94 and even in the presence of o vacancies @xcite , and pzt is no exception .",
    "the shannon radii of ti and zr in octahedral coordination are 0.605 and 0.72   , respectively , yielding @xmath130 for pbtio@xmath7 , which indeed undergoes below @xmath47 off - centering of ti in too large and untilted octahedra , to @xmath131 of pbzro@xmath7 , which undergoes a @xmath132 tilt transition with afe shifts of the cations @xcite , having passed through the more symmetrical rhombohedral @xmath101 structure at intermediate compositions .",
    "conforming to the above discussion , the @xmath8 line encloses the region of low tolerance factor , namely low @xmath133 and low @xmath17 , possibly with some discontinuity when passing from the t to the r+m region , from @xmath134 down to @xmath9 . at this point",
    "it does not prosecute to the maximum value at @xmath135 , but decreases sharply .",
    "the departure from the expected monotonic rise has been already noted and explained in terms of competition between the o afe phase with @xmath97 tilt and the r fe phase ; this would cause a frustration of the pb displacements and consequently inhibit octahedral tilting , which is coupled with such displacements @xcite .",
    "the presence of a phase transition at a @xmath136merging with @xmath8  around @xmath86alternatively suggests that the phase ( r+m)@xmath104 , in addition to the cation shifts away from @xmath100 $ ] , has an initial stage of octahedral tilting . in other words",
    ", if a structural transition occurs in that temperature range , it seems more likely that its driving force acts on the octahedral tilting rather than on antiferroelectric cation shifts . in this manner",
    "the depression of the boundary of the @xmath38 phase is a consequence of the fact that the mismatch between ( ti / zr)-o bonds and pb - obonds has been relaxed by the first tilting transition at @xmath5 , and further cooling below @xmath6 is necessary in order to trigger the final @xmath101 pattern . in this view",
    ", the frustration between the fe and afe phases would mainly broaden and split in two stages the tilting transition , and the depression of the combined @xmath137  line near @xmath73  is much less important than that of the @xmath6  curve alone .",
    "the existence of coupling between tilts and polar modes is recognizable by the effect of the transition at @xmath6 on the polarisation @xcite , and dielectric susceptibility @xcite ( see also the present data ) , by the reduction of the extrinsic contribution to piezoelectric effect in the tilted @xmath38 phase @xcite and is also indicated by first - principle calculations @xcite .",
    "we can only make conjectures on the nature of the transition at @xmath138 based on our susceptibility experiments .",
    "if it is indeed an initial stage of the rotations of the octahedra , it may be a tilt pattern intermediate between those of the o and r@xmath41 phases , like @xmath103 @xcite , or it may involve the @xmath139 in - phase rotation modes @xcite . indeed",
    ", although no experimental phonon - dispersion data are available for pbzro@xmath7 @xcite , first - principles calculations indicate that the whole @xmath140 branch is unstable , and not only the @xmath141 mode of anti - phase rotations @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that a combination of the two types of instabilities produces a relatively disordered tilt pattern , which becomes the ordered @xmath101 ( @xmath38 ) or @xmath103 ( @xmath142 ) structure below @xmath6 .",
    "the concept of disordered tilts has been proposed for explaining why the techniques providing snapshots of the local structure , the x - ray absorption spectroscopies exafs and xanes and the pair distribution function from neutron diffraction , do not see any change at the tilt transitions of perovskites like natao@xmath7 @xcite and the same pzt @xcite .",
    "the situation is similar for most of the apparently displacive transformations in perovskites involving off - centering of cations , like the fe transitions in batio@xmath7 and pbtio@xmath7 .",
    "the issue has been solved by assuming that those transitions have an important order - disorder component , so that the ti atoms are off - center also in the cubic phase , but without correlation between different cells @xcite .",
    "the application of the same concept to the transitions involving concomitant rotations of the octahedra about more than one direction is less obvious , since completely disordered tilts would require excessive distortions of the octahedra .",
    "yet , the idea that the phase @xmath37 of pzt is untilted on the average but locally tilted has been adopted by other authors @xcite , also to justify the fact that first principle calculations indicate the tilted @xmath38 structure and not the @xmath37 one as the ground state of pzt @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the hypothesis that the initially disordered tilting below @xmath5 becomes long range ordered below @xmath6 provides a rationale for the different aspects of the two anomalies :  the one at @xmath5 is diffuse due to the dynamical frustration of the tilts , while that at @xmath6 is sharp .",
    "although the transition at @xmath5 had never been reported before , the existence of an additional phase of still controversial nature in the pzt phase diagram near the boundary to the o phase is indicated by electron diffraction experiments . in such experiments , @xmath143 reflections",
    "have been observed near room temperature , which are incompatible with both the o and r phases , and have first been attributed to in - phase tilting of the octahedra @xcite .",
    "later , it has been argued that rotations or distortions of the o octahedra would not be sufficient to produce spots with the observed intensities @xcite ; moreover , in - phase rotations would not produce reflections with @xmath144 , which are instead observed , and are generally unlikely to occur in perovskites with @xmath128 only slightly smaller than 1 @xcite .",
    "the superlattice reflections have therefore been attributed to antiferroelectric shifts of pb away from @xmath145 in the @xmath146 directions , as in the neighboring afe o phase .",
    "a difficulty in characterizing the new structure is that the superlattice reflections are observed only in electron diffraction , but not in x - ray and neutron diffraction @xcite ; possible reasons are small scattering intensities due to the different cross sections in the different techniques , and the occurrence of these atomic displacements as surface effects in the very thin samples used for tem @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , a narrow region of intermediate phase between the afe o and the fe r phases has been proposed @xcite , untilted @xmath147 at higher temperature and tilted @xmath142 below the usual @xmath6 border . according to this phase diagram , @xmath5 would correspond to the transition from @xmath37 to @xmath147 .",
    "while the present measurements on ceramic samples prove that the presence of an intermediate phase below @xmath5 is a bulk phenomenon , we feel that the question whether the transition involves only cation shifts or also octahedral rotations is yet open , in view of the expected small intensity of reflections connected with o shifts @xcite .",
    "the issue should be clarified by careful neutron diffraction experiments , which are more sensitive to o displacements and do not involve the uncertainties connected with very thin samples where surface effects are important and the actual temperature under the electron beam may be considerably higher than expected .      there is abundant literature on pzt near the @xmath16 composition , so that it seems appropriate to examine possible signatures of the transition at @xmath48 in previous studies , which had been overlooked because smaller and less definite than the anomalies at @xmath6 .",
    "a first indication of a transition at @xmath5 comes from a minor step in the steeply falling @xmath148  curve of pzt 90/10 in figure 6 of reference @xcite , although it had not been recognized as such , being less clear than the transition at @xmath6 .",
    "also the temperature dependence of the rhombohedral angle @xmath149  in pzt 90/10 may be re - examined .",
    "such an angle is related to the octahedral tilt angle in the r structure @xcite , and the lack of clear change of slope of @xmath149  at @xmath6  was explained @xcite as due to dynamic fluctuations of the tilt angle above @xmath6 , an explanation very similar to the assumption of a @xmath150 phase of disordered tilts .",
    "the difference is that the tilt disorder in the @xmath151 phase would not be dynamic but almost static with onset around @xmath5 .",
    "the fact that the local symmetry of pzt 90/10 is lower than rhombohedral is confirmed by recent infrared and raman spectroscopy experiments @xcite , where several additional modes are observed , besides those of a uniform r phase .",
    "such modes are compatible with the additional disordered pb shifts in the orthorhombic directions @xcite but also with the @xmath139 in - phase tilt mode of the o octahedra @xcite , which , together with the anti - phase @xmath141 mode , would produce a disordered tilt pattern . in the same study ,",
    "dielectric susceptibility curves of pzt 90/10 are shown , which are very similar to those of figure [ fig diel ] , except for the lack of a clear anomaly at @xmath5 ; the hump in the imaginary part , however , appears with 2% la doping @xcite .",
    "new anelastic and dielectric spectroscopy experiments are presented on pbzr@xmath152ti@xmath1o@xmath7 with @xmath153  and @xmath154 @xmath155 , providing new information on the phase diagram of pzt at the critical compositions near the antiferroelectric and morphotropic borders . at @xmath16 ,",
    "a new diffuse phase transformation is found at @xmath156  k , which is interpreted as the onset of disordered tilting of the o octahedra , before the long - range ordered tilt pattern develops at the well established sharp transition at @xmath36  k. indications of such a phase transformation from earlier literature are also reported . on increasing ti content , @xmath5 decreases and merges with @xmath63 around @xmath86 .",
    "in this interpretation , the onset temperature for octahedral tilting monotonically increases from @xmath157 within the ti - rich tetragonal phase up to the antiferroelectric transition of pbzro@xmath7 .",
    "the well known depression of @xmath158 below @xmath9 would be due to the fact that the mismatch between the cation radii is partially relieved at the initial transition at @xmath159 .",
    "the combined @xmath160border presents a much shallower depression near @xmath161 but further anelastic and dielectric experiments at additional compositions with @xmath162 are necessary to clarify the exact shape of the borders of the phase diagram , for example if the @xmath5 line merges with @xmath6 , as depicted in figure [ fig pd ] , or crosses it and prosecutes , as proposed by woodward _",
    "@xcite yet , the exact nature of the intermediate phase or phases close to the border with the afe o phase should be clarified by additional diffraction experiments , analysed with the consciousness of the existence of a transition at @xmath5 .",
    "it is discussed why the frequency independent maximum of the linear and elastic compliance at the mpb can hardly be explained by finely twinned r phase alone , and rather indicates the presence of a monoclinic phase , possibly stabilized by the internal random strains and coexisting with the rhombohedral one . the @xmath163 line is also shown to be perfectly continuous up to the mpb , which , together with a smooth evolution of the anelastic spectra with varying composition , provides evidence against a clear border between rhombohedral and monoclinic phases , and rather confirms the recent structural studies where the two structures are found to coexist over a broad composition range .    the authors thank mr . c. capiani ( istec ) for the skillful preparation of the samples , mr",
