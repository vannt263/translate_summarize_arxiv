    "we developed the statistical asynchronous regression ( sar ) technique described in this paper as part of a study of relativistic electron conditions at geosynchronous orbit .",
    "this part of the earth s radiation belts can evolve on a timescale of hours or even minutes .",
    "unfortunately , while individual satellites may make measurements every few seconds , it is difficult to separate the temporal changes from consequences of orbital motion . the easiest way to do",
    "this would be to have continuous measurements at a fixed location , or local time , such as local noon .",
    "instead , we have continuous measurements on board moving spacecraft .",
    "we can remove the orbital effects if we can map our continuous measurements to local noon at geosynchronous orbit .",
    "relativistic electrons in the vicinity of geosynchronous orbit drift around the earth every 5 - 15 minutes under the influence of the local magnetic field .",
    "as it happens , these electrons do not follow circular paths like satellite orbits , but rather elliptical paths that depend on the details of the local magnetic field geometry . however , because electron density is a relatively smooth function of altitude near geosynchronous orbit , measurements at different local times are strongly correlated .",
    "this correlation is stronger still if we average our data over several drift periods .",
    "the strong correlation suggests that we can map our continuous measurements to local noon , if we can determine the right mapping function .",
    "sometimes it is possible to determine empirical mappings between measurements at different local times by regression of simultaneous measurements .",
    "for example , it is possible to relate measurements made by the goes  8 spacecraft at local dawn ( 0600 ) to goes  9 measurements at local 10 am ( 1000 ) , because whenever goes  8 is at local dawn , goes  9 is at local 10 am . however , it is never the case that goes  8 is at local dawn when goes  9 is at local noon . therefore , we need some method for mapping measurements from anywhere to local noon ( or some other local time of interest ) . until recently ,",
    "there have been three strategies for resolving this difficulty : interpolate between multiple calibrated spacecraft @xcite , use the equation of motion of electrons in model electromagnetic fields to follow particles around geosynchronous orbit @xcite , or use some kind of empirical description of the orbital variations @xcite .",
    "the first approach degrades substantially when only a few spacecraft are available , and fails when only one spacecraft is available .",
    "the second approach suffers from the substantial imperfections in our magnetic field models near geosynchronous @xcite .",
    "the third approach has been applied with encouraging success by _ moorer _ [ 1999 ] , who uses whatever measurements are available to adjust the crresele empirical radiation belt model for best agreement .",
    "the sar technique provides us with a more robust approach that can be applied in cases when there is no pre - existing empirical model like crresele .",
    "the sar technique calibrates not only between spacecraft and instruments but also between different locations ( local times ) around geosynchronous orbit .",
    "one can easily imagine the sar technique as calibrating measurements made by goes  8 at local dawn to measurements made by goes  9 at local noon  even though these two spacecraft have never been at these locations simultaneously .",
    "additionally , the sar technique is non - parametric because it does not require us to assume a functional form for the mapping between local times .",
    "when we have described the sar technique to our colleagues , many have found it novel and challenging to understand , and some have stated that it might be useful in their own work on other problems . for our own purposes , since we have used this technique as the basis of a statistical study of the energetic electrons near geosynchronous orbit , we present this technique to familiarize our audience with the technique and to demonstrate its robustness . as we believe the sar technique has applications beyond the electron radiation belts , we have chosen to dedicate this paper entirely to the technique itself , reserving the radiation belt study to a later publication .",
    "in essence , our method provides a means of performing a regression of one time varying quantity against another without requiring simultaneous knowledge of both .",
    "we call this the statistical asynchronous regression ( sar ) method , because it allows us to regress @xmath0 against @xmath1 using only the two statistical distributions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the sar method determines the function @xmath4 by matching the quantiles ( or percentiles ) @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the distributions of x and y for each probability level . a primitive variant of this technique was developed to standardize the calculation of @xmath7 indices at different magnetic observatories ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we also note that a transformation similar to the sar method has been introduced to map non - gaussian random variables onto gaussian ones , with application to the construction of multivariate distribution functions in high - energy particle physics experiments @xcite , in the theory of portfolio in finance @xcite , and earlier in the treatment of bivariate gamma distributions @xcite .    in statistics ,",
    "one method of graphical hypothesis testing is the q - q ( quantile - quantile ) plot @xcite , which is essentially a graphical depiction of @xmath8 based on the same principle as the sar method .",
    "a linear @xmath8 indicates that the two variables differ only by a scaling and an offset but are otherwise identically distributed .",
    "however , in spite of the variety of graphical techniques related to the sar method , none makes use of the plotted @xmath8 , aside from determining whether it is linear @xcite .",
    "since we are specifically interested in potentially nonlinear @xmath8 , we have developed the sar method as an extension to the q - q plot .    under various names , such as _ anchoring _ or the _ equipercentile _ method , psychological and educational testing use the same principle as the sar technique to normalize a new test to a standard score distribution @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath8 is not explicitly calculated , and the information it contains is typically discarded .",
    "additionally , the spearman rank order correlation coefficient touches on the same notion as the sar method @xcite .",
    "it calculates a linear correlation coefficient between the sorted rank orders of two quantities rather than the quantities themselves ; this coefficient measures the quality of the optimal nonlinear mapping between two simultaneously measured quantities .",
    "since we are concerned with comparing quantities not measured simultaneously , we will not make use of the spearman coefficient .    in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will provide a description and some limited analysis of the sar method .",
    "first , we will describe the technique by parable , using a graphical illustration .",
    "next we will provide the formal derivation of the technique .",
    "we will provide several examples and a simple recipe for the implementation of the sar technique .",
    "then we will address the problems of finite sample size and noisy measurements .",
    "finally we will show how we use the sar method to map geosynchronous energetic electron flux from one local time to another .",
    "we begin our explanation of the sar technique by taking a step back from space physics to a simpler analogous problem .",
    "suppose we have two meteorologists making measurements every other day .",
    "one has been measuring his favorite meteorological quantity @xmath9 , and the other has been measuring @xmath10 .",
    "unfortunately , owing to an error in scheduling , the two meteorologists have not been making their measurements on the same days .",
    "it is therefore impossible for them to plot @xmath10 against @xmath9 and perform a regression .",
    "we will show how it is nonetheless possible for them to recover the empirical function @xmath4 .",
    "the powerful statistical tool that will make this possible is the fundamental principle that probability is conserved under a change of variables .",
    "we will leave the mathematical presentation of this principle to later sections .    in",
    ", we have plotted the probability density functions ( pdfs ) @xmath11 and @xmath12 along the @xmath5- and @xmath6-axes respectively . for clarity",
    ", we have plotted @xmath11 upside down and @xmath12 rotated counterclockwise .",
    "each density function represents the distribution of observations made by one of the scientists . in this example",
    ", @xmath9 is distributed uniformly between 1 and 2 , and @xmath10 is distributed as @xmath13 between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we have also plotted the relational function @xmath16 that provides the change of variables .",
    "the shaded area within @xmath11 is the probability that a single measurement of @xmath9 falls between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , the shaded area within @xmath12 is the probability that a single measurement of @xmath10 falls between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the conservation of probability is illustrated graphically by the fact that the two shaded regions are equal in area . with any two of these three curves ,",
    "it is possible to determine the third .",
    "generally , it has been of greater interest to reconstruct @xmath12 knowing @xmath11 and @xmath8 .",
    "we , however , are interested in reconstructing @xmath8 knowing only @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the fundamental assumption is that of stationarity : the unknown relationship @xmath4 is the same at all times ; this condition must be met for a statistical approach to be possible .",
    "one can reconstruct @xmath4 for each @xmath9 simply by finding the value @xmath10 such that the area inside @xmath12 from @xmath21 to @xmath10 is equal to the area inside @xmath11 from @xmath21 to @xmath9 . in",
    "we demonstrate this cumulative way of looking at the problem . instead of plotting the density functions @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ", we have plotted the cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the cdfs are the integrals from @xmath21 to @xmath5 of @xmath11 and @xmath21 to @xmath6 of @xmath12 , and they correspond to the areas inside @xmath11 and @xmath12 mentioned above . to find the @xmath10 that corresponds to a given @xmath9 in figure  [ pedanticcdf ] , one reads from the @xmath9 value on the abscissa up to @xmath2 then horizontally over to the same value of @xmath3 , and back down to the abscissa to find the corresponding @xmath10 .",
    "compared to figure  [ pedanticpdf ] , this visualization makes it easier to find @xmath10 for a given @xmath9 , but does not provide an obvious representation of @xmath8 . while emphasizing different features of the method , these two graphical representations of the method give identical results .",
    "in the following sections , we will provide the formal mathematical treatment of the graphical operations .",
    "some of our readers will no doubt be a bit rusty in the manipulation of probabilities .",
    "therefore , we have included a thorough treatment of the change of variables theorem in an appendix . here , we begin with the differential form of the change of variables : @xmath22    in order to use this equation",
    ", we must determine the sign of @xmath23 . for distributions with only one tail",
    ", we can do this rather easily by examining the rare values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "when the rare values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 fall at the same end of the real number line , @xmath23 is positive .",
    "when they fall at opposite ends , @xmath23 is negative .",
    "physical insight is also a useful tool in determining the sign of @xmath23 .",
    "if we expect larger ( or more positive ) values of @xmath9 to correspond to larger values of @xmath10 , then @xmath23 is positive .",
    "if we expect larger values of @xmath9 to correspond to smaller ( or more negative ) values of @xmath10 , then @xmath23 is negative .    for @xmath24",
    ", we can integrate ( [ changeofvars ] ) , @xmath25 this equation implicitly defines @xmath26 as the function that provides the matching integration bounds .",
    "we recognize these integrals as the cdfs of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , so we can rewrite ( [ uposintegral ] ) as @xmath27 we can invert @xmath3 to arrive at an explicit equation for @xmath28 , @xmath29 this equation represents the mathematical counterpart to the graphical operation described in figure  [ pedanticcdf ] , where one moves up from @xmath9 to @xmath2 , then across to @xmath3 , then back down to the corresponding @xmath10 .    for @xmath30 , we can integrate ( [ changeofvars ] ) , @xmath31 converting this equation to cdfs , we have @xmath32 solving for @xmath28 , we arrive at @xmath33 combining ( [ uforupos ] ) and ( [ uforuneg ] ) we arrive at @xmath34    it is clear , then , that all we need to determine @xmath28 is knowledge of the sign of @xmath23 and either @xmath2 and @xmath3 or @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we summarize the desirable properties of @xmath28 as follows :    * it can be arbitrarily nonlinear ; * its determination is not parametric ; * it maps the entire distribution and all of the moments of @xmath9 onto those of @xmath10 ; * it can be determined without simultaneous measurements of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we now turn to some more sophisticated examples of the sar method .",
    "first , we will return to our original meteorological example to demonstrate the sar procedure on analytical functions .",
    "then , we will provide a function relating a bimodal distribution to a gaussian .",
    "finally , we will demonstrate the method on a stretched exponential and a gaussian .",
    "in the example of the meteorologists , illustrated in figures [ pedanticpdf ] and [ pedanticcdf ] , the following analytical functions were used : @xmath35 using ( [ xcdf ] ) and ( [ ycdf ] ) together with ( [ analyticalpdfx ] ) and ( [ analyticalpdfy ] ) , we have @xmath36 inserting ( [ analyticalcdfx ] ) and ( [ analyticalcdfy ] ) into ( [ uforupos ] ) , we see that @xmath37 adding in the proper bounds , we have @xmath38      in our next example , we will show how the sar method easily handles bimodal distributions .",
    "we have chosen @xmath9 to be bimodal and @xmath10 to be unimodal .",
    "the pdfs are @xmath39 @xmath40 while there is no closed form for @xmath8 , a graphical display can show its qualitative features . shows how the bimodal @xmath11 maps to @xmath12 .",
    "the highly nonlinear mapping @xmath8 has a flat spot ( with small but still positive slope ) corresponding to the local minimum in @xmath11 , since @xmath41 . in figure",
    "[ bimodalpdf ] , we see how a large range of @xmath9 values near @xmath42 maps to a very narrow range of @xmath10 values near @xmath43 . more generally , the terraced shape of @xmath8 can be seen to generate bimodal or multimodal distributions from unimodal ones .      for our final example",
    ", we will treat an unusual distribution and an unusual mapping .",
    "we consider the case of a stretched exponential mapped to a gaussian . in this case ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are distributed as @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are positive real values . using ( [ changeofvars ] ) and assuming @xmath49 , we can write a differential equation for @xmath28 , @xmath50 by our design of ( [ stretchpdf ] )",
    ", @xmath28 will cause the two exponentials to drop out of the equation , satisfying the system @xmath51 solving ( [ exponentialsu ] ) for @xmath28 we have @xmath52 which is , in fact , the solution to ( [ exponentialsuprime ] ) and thus of ( [ upowerlaw ] ) .",
    "this mapping function is a highly nonlinear power - law . in ,",
    "we have depicted the borderline case for @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . for @xmath57 ,",
    "this distribution becomes a stretched exponential , which is a common distribution in real data .",
    "while @xmath11 diverges at @xmath58 , the sar method cleanly recovers the mapping function @xmath59 .",
    "we are now going to investigate the robustness of the sar method on finite and noisy data sets .",
    "so far , we have considered the analytical representations of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . however , in practice , we will only have a finite number of samples of each variable .",
    "we can use these samples to construct @xmath2 and @xmath3 and then perform either a tabular or an analytical approximation to ( [ ufinal ] ) .",
    "first , we sort the @xmath9 and @xmath10 values .",
    "these sorted values give us an approximation to @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "for example , if @xmath60 is the @xmath61 smallest value in @xmath62 measurements of @xmath9 , then an estimate of @xmath2 is @xmath63 similarly , we estimate @xmath3 as @xmath64 there are more sophisticated methods of estimating these distributions , such as kernel estimators @xcite , if the need arises .    henceforth , we will only treat the case @xmath65 , but the interested reader can easily derive the @xmath66 case in a similar fashion . to obtain @xmath8 for a particular @xmath9",
    ", we find @xmath67 such that @xmath68 next we find @xmath69 and @xmath70 such that @xmath71 we then have an estimate of @xmath10 @xmath72 by determining a @xmath10 for each sample of @xmath9 , we achieve a tabular definition of @xmath4 .",
    "we have depicted the mapping process and the uncertainty for the bimodal example in .",
    "we have chosen artificially small datasets of @xmath73 and @xmath74 to illustrate the estimation effect .",
    "the approximate uncertainty @xmath75 in the @xmath10 estimated from ( [ yestimator ] ) is given by @xmath76 we can rewrite ( [ rawdeltayeqn ] ) in terms of @xmath77 as @xmath78 this expression contains a first order estimate of the derivative of @xmath77 which , using ( [ ycdf ] ) , can be expressed in terms of @xmath12 as @xmath79 therefore ( [ deltaing ] ) can be expressed as @xmath80 rewriting ( [ j1condition ] ) and ( [ j2condition ] ) using ( [ fest ] ) and ( [ gest ] ) , we have @xmath81 therefore @xmath82 which leads us to @xmath83 here , @xmath62 accounts for the sampling effect .",
    "this relationship implies that in the rarified regions of the @xmath10 distribution , where @xmath12 is small , the estimation error is large .",
    "it also suggests that , to first order , increasing the @xmath10 sample size @xmath84 is not as useful in reducing @xmath75 as would be increasing the @xmath9 sample size @xmath62 .",
    "however , the uncertainty in @xmath5 is also important because the total uncertainty in @xmath5-@xmath6 space is @xmath85 . by a derivation similar to that of @xmath75",
    ", we have @xmath86 for a total uncertainty of @xmath87 to improve the overall quality of the reconstruction of @xmath4 , we would like both @xmath62 and @xmath84 to be as large as possible .",
    "another consideration for the implementation of the sar method is the effect of noise . until now",
    ", we have assumed that there is no noise in our measurements of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "however , in practice , we always encounter noisy data , and we want to be sure that the sar does not become invalid under typically noisy conditions . in a standard regression , where simultaneous values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are known , a least - squares approach can be used to determine @xmath8 from noisy @xmath9 and @xmath10 . we will attempt to demonstrate the effect of noise on the sar method by simulating a noisy version of the meteorological example .",
    "we generate 100 noisy samples from the distributions @xmath11 and @xmath12 given in ( [ analyticalpdfx ] ) and ( [ analyticalpdfy ] ) .",
    "the noise distributions are chosen to be unbiased gaussians with standard deviations @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "for now , we choose @xmath88 and @xmath89 to be 25% of the standard deviations @xmath90 and @xmath91 of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we can fit the noisy data with @xmath92 .",
    "we perform two such fits : a standard least - squares regression on the @xmath93 pairs and least - squares regression on the @xmath94 pairs produced by the sar method described in ( [ yestimator ] ) . for this parametric example",
    ", a maximum likelihood estimation of @xmath95 and @xmath96 would probably outperform the least - squares approach , but we will compare to the more familiar regression for this illustration .    ideally , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , but , for the noisy data , the two regressions give @xmath99 the sar fit is significantly better than the standard regression . in the future , it would be interesting to study how this depends on the type of noise and the form of @xmath8 . in , we see a graphical depiction of the noisy data and the two fits . both fits lie very close to the true @xmath8 curve compared to the noisy data , however there is a clear improvement with the sar fit .",
    "to understand better the effect of noise , we repeat the above simulation 5000 times to obtain a distribution of @xmath95 for each fitting approach .",
    "these distributions are plotted in .",
    "it is clear that both methods provide biased estimates of @xmath95 .",
    "the sar method produces a smaller bias , but we would still like to know how that bias depends on the noise amplitude . we can test this dependence by finding the bias for various noise / signal ratios @xmath100 .",
    "we will choose the same @xmath100 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , such that @xmath101 so far , we have only tested @xmath102 , but now we will test a full range from @xmath103 to @xmath104 . in , we have plotted the median estimated @xmath95 versus @xmath100 .",
    "we see that for small noise , the estimate quality is high , but , as @xmath100 approaches 1 , the estimation fails .",
    "the @xmath95 estimated by the sar method is generally of higher quality than the estimate from the standard regression .",
    "for relatively large noise amplitude neither regression method produces quality estimates of @xmath95 .",
    "it is clear that , while the derivation of the sar method assumes noiseless data , our implementation of the sar method is at least as robust to noise as is the traditional least - squares regression .",
    "the sar appears to be reliable when the noise amplitude is small compared to the variability of the data sample .",
    "finally , we would like to demonstrate the sar method on a real problem from space physics .",
    "the goes  8 geosynchronous spacecraft measures , among other things , the flux of electrons with energies above 2 mev .",
    "the spacecraft orbits the earth once per day .",
    "the electron populations at geosynchronous orbit are organized by the position of the sun relative to the earth , which we identify as local time .",
    "owing to the asymmetry of the earth s magnetic field in space , as the spacecraft passes through different local times , it measures slightly different parts of the radiation belts . because the relativistic electron density varies smoothly with altitude and the electrons themselves make slightly elliptical orbits every few minutes , hour averaged fluxes at all locations around geosynchronous orbit are well correlated @xcite ; we therefore expect a monotonically increasing function @xmath4 relating fluxes @xmath9 measured at one local time @xmath105 to fluxes @xmath10 measured at another local time @xmath106 .",
    "we can estimate the flux at @xmath106 from a measurement made by the spacecraft at @xmath105 if we can determine @xmath8 .",
    "the probability distributions of electron measurements at every local time at geosynchronous are relatively stationary in time ; that is , the distribution of measurements in one year is roughly equivalent to the distribution of measurements in any other year . therefore , we can estimate @xmath2 and @xmath3 using historical measurements of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and we can use the sar method to reconstruct @xmath8 .",
    "we will assume @xmath105 is local dawn and @xmath106 is local noon .",
    "we have obtained goes  8 measurements for 1998 from cdaweb ( http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) @xcite .",
    "we calculated hourly averages and grouped them into 1-hour bins near local dawn and local noon .",
    "this gives us about 360 samples at each location , but none that are simultaneous because the spacecraft is only at one location at a time .",
    "because electron measurements tend to be heavily biased toward low values , we will use the complementary cumulative distribution functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 . in terms of these functions , for a monotonically increasing @xmath8 , we have @xmath109    shows the constructed @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we can fit both distributions with the same analytical form : @xmath112 assuming an increasing @xmath8 , we use ( [ uforuposcomplements ] ) to arrive at an analytical form for @xmath8 : @xmath113 the non - parametric sar mapping is shown in to be nearly a power - law .",
    "we have determined an analytical fit to be @xmath114 this fit is in agreement with the function @xmath115 derived in ( [ nfak ] ) above from the implementation of the sar method using the parameterizations ( [ tre ] ) and ( [ hfs ] ) of the cumulative distributions .",
    "the fact that the exponent in ( [ fakal ] ) is very nearly 1 indicates that the densities at dawn and noon change in fixed proportion to each other , even as the radiation belts are filled during geomagnetic activity . if we imagine the electron phase - space structure to be @xmath116 , then we can state the proportionality as @xmath117 this relationship suggests a simple separation of variables : @xmath118 where @xmath119 represents a phase space shape function , and @xmath120 represents the varying global relativistic electron content of the geosynchronous region .",
    "the parameterizations ( [ tre ] ) and ( [ hfs ] ) together with the corresponding prediction ( [ nfak ] ) validated by the direct non - parametric implementation of the sar method giving ( [ fakal ] ) suggest in addition a simple and useful representation of the heavy tail structure of the distribution of electron fluxes in terms of stretched exponentials .",
    "such distributions have been found to parameterize a large variety of distributions found in nature as well as in social sciences @xcite .",
    "they present a quasi - stable property @xcite and can be shown to be the generic result of the product of random variables in the `` extreme deviation '' regime @xcite .",
    "so far , we have only determined the mapping from local dawn to local noon .",
    "it may also be necessary to allow u(x ) to vary with magnetic activity level .",
    "the magnetic indices dst and kp measure the intensity of the magnetospheric ring current and the variability of magnetospheric currents , respectively @xcite .",
    "we can create different mappings @xmath121 for each of several bins of geomagnetic indices ; such binning would organize the data by the state of the system , reinforcing the assumption that each @xmath121 is monotonic and time invariant . using the sar method , we can find mapping functions from every local time to every other local time , depending on geomagnetic activity , as necessary ; this allows us to reconstruct the flux around the entire orbit at any time based only on the single measurement made by goes  8 .",
    "if we produce fluxes around the entire orbit every hour , we can view spatial and temporal variations separately .",
    "in particular , if we reconstruct a time series of hourly fluxes at a fixed local time , we can perform various time series analyses that will not be influenced by the spatial variations seen in the measured time - series .",
    "this investigation will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to accurately determine the function relating two variables even when they are not measured simultaneously . specifically , we were trying to map energetic electron fluxes between different local times at geosynchronous orbit . however , we believe that our solution may be useful to other researchers whose data are not taken simultaneously .",
    "we developed a technique , statistical asynchronous regression ( sar ) , that uses the statistical distributions of two variables to determine the unique monotonic function that can map one distribution onto the other . because the sar technique only works",
    "when there is a monotonic relationship between the two quantities , it should only be applied to quantities that are believed to be highly correlated with each other .",
    "we caution that the sar technique will produce a relationship for any two quantities , regardless of whether they are actually related .",
    "it is particularly inappropriate to use the sar to describe chaotic systems , which generally arise from non - monotonic behaviors .",
    "also , when the noise amplitude is a substantial fraction of the data sample variability , we do not expect the sar to give reliable results .    to illustrate the sar technique when the two distributions are known analytically",
    ", we have provided several examples of common distributions .",
    "we have shown that the sar technique can recover the underlying relationship of the two quantities even when one distribution diverges or has more than one local maximum .",
    "we have provided a simple algorithm for implementing the sar .",
    "we derived simple expressions for the uncertainty in the estimated relationship between the two quantities . to ensure that the technique is robust for noisy data , we have simulated two noisy variables with a known relationship and determined how well the sar technique recovers that relationship ; the sar performs than a least squared error regression , which requires simultaneous measurements of both quantities .",
    "while we expect that ultimately most scientists will wish to fit @xmath8 to some parametric form , we feel that it is important that the sar does not require us to assume a parametric form a priori .    for those wishing to apply the sar technique to problems where @xmath122 passes through zero ,",
    "we offer the following strategy : if the @xmath123 occurs at known @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then the sar technique is perfectly valid in bins of @xmath9 and @xmath10 constrained to be between the zeros of @xmath122 . in this way",
    ", the sar would provide a piecewise form of @xmath8 .    in closing",
    ", we would like to suggest some areas that might benefit from the sar approach . in modeling tectonic deformations ,",
    "it is useful to quantify the balance of deformation accommodated by different faults in a complex network @xcite . for an individual fault",
    ", we often can measure only its length or its offset . relying only on faults with both length and offset known",
    "would exclude many useful measurements .",
    "however , the physics of tectonic deformation leads us to expect a monotonic relationship between fault length and offset . in this case",
    ", the sar technique would allow us to regress fault length against fault offset , using all of the available measurements .",
    "similarly , for individual earthquakes we often know only one of seismic moment and energy released @xcite ; the sar technique would allow us to regress all the available measurements rather than only those from earthquakes with both moment and energy known .",
    "we hope that the ideas presented here will assist those who need to relate non - simultaneous measurements .",
