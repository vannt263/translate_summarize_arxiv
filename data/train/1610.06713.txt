    "vex _  earth  l1 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , our method can be summarized in the following steps :    1 .",
    "the cme eruption is imaged with coronagraphs , which yields the cme initial speed and direction .",
    "the cme propagation is modeled from sun to _ vex _ and _ wind _ with the drag - based model ( dbm , * ? ? ?",
    "inputs are the cme initial speed and the solar wind background speed from a wsa - enlil simulation run @xcite .",
    "the output is the cme speed and distance as function of time .",
    "the cme propagation with dbm is constrained with the shock arrival time at _ vex_. the input is the time of the cme shock arrival at _ vex _ , and the dbm drag - parameter @xmath10 forms the output of this procedure .",
    "the cme magnetic field components observed by _ vex _ are scaled to earth l1 in magnitude by using an inverse power law in heliocentric distance derived from previous studies . then the field is shifted in time according to the kinematics obtained from the previous steps .",
    "5 .   finally ,",
    "using the calculated magnetic field and speed of the cme at earth l1 , the time profile of the _ dst _ index is produced .",
    "we now discuss these steps in a more detailed manner before applying them to actual data in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "we use the dbm from @xcite to get the time dependent cme position and speed .",
    "strictly speaking , all arrival times and speeds we quote from dbm are valid for the location of the shock at the front of the icme .",
    "the dbm requires three input parameters , which are : the initial speed of the cme , @xmath11 , at initial distance from the sun , @xmath12 , the solar wind background speed , @xmath13 , and the drag parameter , @xmath10 , so that the shock speed , @xmath14 , and distance from the sun , @xmath15 , as functions of time are given by :    @xmath16+wt+r_0\\label{dbm : rt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the @xmath17 solution indicates deceleration or acceleration of the cme by the ambient solar wind , where a plus means deceleration ( @xmath18 ) and minus stands for acceleration ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the cme initial speed is derived from coronagraph observations and for the solar wind background speed @xmath13 we rely on the wsa - enlil model because , unfortunately , _ vex _ does not provide plasma observations .",
    "the background speed is determined by cutting out a solar wind speed profile from wsa  enlil along the sun  earth line from the start of the cme until its shock arrives at the in situ spacecraft .",
    "obtaining @xmath13 with the help of wsa  enlil provides a way to avoid using a fixed standard solar wind speed and allows high speed streams to be taken into account .",
    "additionally , this allows an estimate of the speed along the sun - earth line that the cme encounters during its propagation from the sun to earth , while observations from _ vex _ , if available , would only provide the speed at _ vex_.    the drag - parameter , @xmath10 , is a free parameter within a typical range of @xmath20 to @xmath21 @xcite , although other studies revealed that smaller values of @xmath10 on the order of @xmath22 are also possible @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the shock arrival time at _ vex _ allows us to constrain @xmath10 in a way that the predicted shock arrival from the dbm at _ vex _ matches the actual , measured arrival time of the shock .",
    "this is an important new step , that distinguishes this method from other cme forecasting methods , since once @xmath10 is fixed , the predicted arrival time and the speed of the shock at earth l1 can be narrowed down considerably . using in situ arrival times to constrain cme parameters to study their kinematics",
    "has already been introduced by @xcite , but here we apply this concept for the first time in order to predict the cme parameters at another location .",
    "there are some limitations in the use of the dbm with a constant @xmath10 and solar wind speed @xmath13 regarding the flexibility to adapt to changes in the ambient medium , for example changes in the solar wind speed or to cme  cme interactions , such as in the event discussed in this paper . for future studies the enhanced dbm , which includes a variability for both @xmath10 and @xmath13 as introduced by @xcite",

    "if a cme may become deflected in interplanetary space , which means that it would propagate non - radially away from the sun , the spacecraft located at earth l1 could pass through different parts of the cme compared to _",

    "however , there is some consensus that the propagation direction of cmes is largely determined close to the sun ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , so we assume here that no interplanetary deflection is taking place .",
    "we are aware that this simple assumption is a limiting case for the accuracy of the method but it enables us to study the potential effects of a deflection of the cme that might happen between the two in situ spacecraft .",

    "this requires the results on cme kinematics by the dbm .",

    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the in situ magnetic field measurements of _ vex _ and _ wind_. since cme3 is earth directed and has the fastest initial speed of the three cmes in question , we associate the time where the total field strength makes the most significant jump in the _ vex _ data as being the shock of cme3 ( appropriately named s3v ) , arriving on 2012 june 16 04:54 ut ( vertical solid line in figure [ fig3]a ) .",
    "this association is also based on the observational fact that faster cmes have a higher in situ magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "this means that the high total field following s3v suggests this structure is caused by cme3 .",
    "note that for 3 interacting cmes this association is very difficult to determine unambiguously , and our association of cme3 with s3v could be challenged by exchanging it with the times of the two other shocks present before s3v .",

    "magnetic flux ropes are easily discerned in in situ data as they show prolonged , large scale field rotations accompanied by a higher total magnetic field as compared to the background wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the presence of at least two more shocks in the vex data ahead of s3v possibly generated by cme1 and cme2 is also consistent with merging . the black line in figure [ fig3]b indicates the most likely arrival of shock s3 at the _ wind _ spacecraft and is appropriately named s3w , arriving on 2012 june 16 19:34 ut , 14 hours and 40 minutes after arriving at _ vex_. in this study",
    ", we do not examine further how the various structures observed in situ at vex and wind might be related to the three cmes .",
    "rather we focus on whether the _ vex _ in situ data mapped to earth can provide a successful prediction of the _ dst _ index .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the dbm results for @xmath15 ( the heliocentric distance in au ) and @xmath14 using an initial speed of cme3 of @xmath62  km  s@xmath6 , which was obtained by @xcite using the graduated cylindrical shell model @xcite at @xmath63 solar radii , assuming this speed to be valid for the initial shock speed .",
    "we used this speed in favor of the speed mentioned in the data section because of its higher accuracy .",
    "this speed is slightly ( @xmath64 km  s@xmath6 ) higher than the average interplanetary propagation speed from hi modeling .",

    "we have determined the background wind speed by taking an average along the sun - earth line in a wsa - enlil run from the launch of the cme on 2012 june 14 14:09 until the time of the s3v arrival at vex , resulting in @xmath66 @xmath17 40 km  s@xmath6 . with",

    "an extrapolation of these kinematics to 0.99 au in figure  [ fig4]a leads to an arrival time at _ wind _ on 2012 june 17 01:42 .",

    "respectively , for a @xmath65 of @xmath71 km  s@xmath6  we obtain a @xmath10 of @xmath72 and a shock arrival on 2012 june 17 02:16 .",
    "this shows , that changing the initial speed from @xmath69 km  s@xmath6  to @xmath71 km  s@xmath6  only changes the _ wind _ arrival time by 84 minutes in total .",
    "the dbm yields an arrival speed at _ wind _ of @xmath73 km  s@xmath6  and an interesting consequence of constraining the dbm fits using the shock arrival time at vex is that increasing the initial cme speed counter - intuitively moves the arrival time at _ wind _ later , and also reduces the arrival speed , for example from @xmath74 km  s@xmath6  for an initial speed of @xmath69 km  s@xmath6  to @xmath75 km  s@xmath6  for an initial speed of @xmath71 km  s@xmath6  .",
    "the reason for this is that a larger drag coefficient is required for an initially higher speed cme to match the vex arrival time , and this greater drag then delays the arrival at _ wind _ and reduces the arrival speed .",

    "the first jump early on 2012 june 16 , to around @xmath76 km  s@xmath6  from a background wind speed of 300 km  s@xmath6 , most likely stems from one of the previous cmes .",

    "note that , counterintuitively , the highest @xmath65 results in the latest arrival time , as well as the lowest arrival speed at _ wind _ and vice versa , because @xmath10 is constrained to the icme arrival time at the in situ spacecraft ( see also figure  [ fig4 ] ) . determination of @xmath10 in this way has the advantage of a good estimate of its average value up to the in situ spacecraft . on the other hand , constraining @xmath10 at the in situ spacecraft and assuming a constant @xmath10 all the way from the sun to earth may lead to inaccurate results if the in situ spacecraft ( the one at @xmath1  au ) would be located at a heliocentric distance closer to the sun , and a variable @xmath10 might be taken into account @xcite .",

    "for point ( 1 ) , consider the following : _ vex _ is located about 6@xmath33  away from the sun  earth line in heliospheric longitude which is equivalent to 0.075 au ( at _ vex _ distance ) and 0.105 au ( at earth distance ) .",
    "an interaction of cme3 with one or both of the two preceding cmes might have distorted the cme shock shape in such a way that the part of shock s3 that travels along the sun ",
    "earth line has already traveled further in heliocentric distance than the part that impacted _",
    "vex_. this could be explained by an inclination of the shock surface .",

    "earth line would be in the order of 0.08 au , thus the possible inclination of the shock surface would be very significant . if hypothesis ( 2 ) holds and the magnetic field structures at _ vex _ and _ wind _ are incorrectly associated , the error between predicted and measured arrival could be different , but this `` association problem '' will be further discussed in future studies .",
    "aside these two hypotheses , we can rule out one other potential factor that could be responsible for the arrival time discrepancy , namely an incorrect determination of the dbm drag parameter @xmath10 . in order to cover the distance of 0.28 au from _ vex _ to earth l1 within the time interval 2012 june 16 04:54 ( s3 at _ vex _ ) and",

    "such a scenario might be possible if cme3 had interacted with one of the preceding cmes somewhere between _ vex _ and earth , but _",
    "vex _ data shows that the interaction already occurred before cme3 hit _ vex _ ( see figure [ fig3]a ) .    to predict the magnetic field at earth",
    "l1 , we have applied equation ( [ eqn : b_scaling_mos ] ) to each magnetic field component from _ vex _ measurements individually , although previous work on scaling of the magnetic field inside flux ropes suggest that the axial and azimuthal components may scale with @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the exponent @xmath88 covers most of this range and a different scaling law may be added in future studies .",
    "we showed that the problem of predicting the geomagnetic effects of cmes may in principle be solved by using in situ magnetometer observations by a spacecraft located in the inner heliosphere close to the sun - earth line , thereby strongly extending the method of @xcite .",
    "the position of the in situ spacecraft is a trade - off between prediction accuracy and lead time , where a spacecraft close to earth provides high accuracy forecasts at the cost of short lead time .",
    "we have studied a cme which led to a moderate geomagnetic storm at earth and likely interacted with two preceding cmes .",
    "we applied for the first time a new method consisting of several steps to predict the _",
    "time profile . with data from",
    "_ vex _ , located at @xmath89 , au we obtained a relatively accurate _",
    "forecast ranging from of @xmath81 to @xmath83 nt ( including error bars ) , near the observed _ dst _ of @xmath80 nt , while still maintaining a prediction lead time of nearly @xmath90 hours . knowing the time of cme ejection at the sun on 2012 june 14 14:09 ut and the arrival at _ vex _ on 2012 june 16 allows us to tightly constrain the cme kinematics , leading to a predicted cme arrival speed at earth of @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 , similar to the observed @xmath79  km  s@xmath6  at _",
    "wind_.    the predicted arrival time of the cme at earth is 2012 june 17 01:40 ut , which is @xmath8 hours later than the true shock arrival .",
    "this discrepancy in arrival time might be explained by an incorrect association between the measured magnetic field structures at _ vex _ and _ wind _ or by an inclination of the shock surface on a scale of 0.08 au in radial distance .",
    "if the shock surface indeed shows such a pronounced local feature , this means that there may exist a limit for the errors in arrival time prediction of cmes on the order of 6 hours , which can not be further improved unless the shock shape is modeled very accurately on scales of @xmath91  au .",
    "our method thus also provides a new tool for detailed diagnostics on cme physics that allows to reveal those small - scale structures .",
    "our obtained results for _ dst _ are relatively accurate despite the interaction of several cmes before they impacted _ vex _ and despite the assumptions that were made regarding the solar wind background speed estimation , magnetic field scaling and determination of the drag parameter @xmath10 . to further improve the accuracy of the results , a better solar wind background speed estimation can be made by a plasma instrument on the in situ spacecraft .",
    "this would allow to map a speed profile that includes any variations in the solar wind background speed , and it would allow an even more constrained calculation of the cme kinematics .",
    "the dbm we used is designed for constant input parameters , so further studies on more events and different heliospheric distances of the in situ spacecraft will reveal if the assumption of a constant @xmath10 and @xmath13 is sufficient , or if the enhanced dbm @xcite with variable @xmath10 and @xmath13 may provide better results .",
    "other improvements of our method include modeling of the expansion of the cme flux rope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even with different power laws for the azimuthal and axial fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a conversion of the predicted @xmath0 component to gsm coordinates , including the cme shock shape @xcite , adding a variable dynamic pressure profile , and using an updated method for predicting _ dst _ from solar wind parameters @xcite . because we have assumed a constant icme density , the positive peak in _",
    "dst _ in figure [ fig5]d , which stems from a very high density and thus dynamic pressure , is not included in the _ dst _ forecast .",
    "however , this peak maximizes at + 95 nt late on 2012 june 16 , which is actually the highest positive _ dst _ value in the entire space age , at least since 1957 .",
    "the impact of these cmes on earth has resulted in a strong magnetospheric compression , and a study of the exact interplanetary causes would be worthwhile .",
    "an application of our method to real time magnetic field data by possible future spacecraft thus provides the possibility to make appropriate and timely arrangements to prepare for the potential effects of cmes on the technological infrastructure of mankind .",
    "our proof - of - concept study may be extended , using any spacecraft temporarily located close to the sun - earth line ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such as _ messenger _ in conjunction with an l1 spacecraft .",
    "in addition any line - up of two spacecraft like _ vex _  _ stereo _ or _ messenger _  _ stereo _ can be used to predict cme arrival times and speeds , as well as magnetic fields from the inner to the outer spacecraft ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it can be applied to future space missions in the inner heliosphere like _ bepicolombo _ , _ solar probe plus _ or _ solar orbiter _ , or to data from permanent in situ observers at an artificial lagrange point like the _ sunjammer _ concept @xcite , which would allow a continuous , gap - free forecast of the _ dst _ index .",
    "it may also be applied to data by a future ring of spacecraft around the sun @xcite , carrying at least a magnetometer , where each spacecraft would drift towards and away from the sun  earth line .",
    "its feasibility and number of spacecraft needed depends mainly on the longitudinal extent of cme flux ropes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which also warrants further study .",
