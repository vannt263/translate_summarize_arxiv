    "neutron stars ( nss ) are born in supernova ( sn ) explosions . while the stellar core collapses , the envelope is ejected outwards .",
    "the ejected material carries angular momentum , due to the rotation of the progenitor star .",
    "if a fraction of the ejecta does not have enough energy to escape , it will form a fallback accretion disc around the collapsed core @xcite .",
    "although a systematic and quantitative study of the fate of the ejected material following a sn explosion is still lacking , fallback discs around nss have been invoked to explain a wide range of ns properties , such as enhanced x - ray luminosities in the anomalous x - ray pulsar @xcite , pulsar braking indices that suggest non - dipolar torques @xcite , pulsar jets ( blackman & perna 2004 ; blaschke , grigorian & voskresensky 2004 ) , discrepancies between the real ( kinematic ) pulsar ages and their characteristic ages @xmath7 @xcite .    from an observational point of view , the search for fallback discs has been quite active in the last decade or so .",
    "following up on the suggestion that fallback discs around nss are brighter in the infrared ( ir ) and at longer wavelengths @xcite , a number of isolated nss have been imaged in those bands @xcite . in particular , @xcite reported the first direct detection of a fallback disc around an isolated ns , based on an ir excess which could be well modelled with emission from a passive , dusty disc .",
    "evidence for ir excess has also been reported in other ns systems @xcite .",
    "if fallback discs around nss are indeed a ubiquitous phenomenon , they can substantially interfere with the spin evolution of the ns .",
    "this will affect estimates of the ns spin birth distribution based on the measured values of the period @xmath8 and its derivative @xmath9 , and the simple assumption that the pulsar slow down is due to dipole radiation only .",
    "the distribution of ns spin births , which contains information on the physics of the sn explosion , has indeed been the subject of of extensive investigation for several decades @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we perform a statistical study of the spin evolution of nss under the combined evolution resulting from dipole radiation losses and the interaction with a fallback disc .",
    "we aim at a ) assessing to what extent the inferred spin birth properties of pulsars can be influenced by the presence of fallback discs , b ) identifying observational properties that can help confirm / rule out a ubiquitous presence of fallback discs and c ) exploring whether fallback discs can help explain some currently puzzling pulsar observations .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : the coupled evolution of the disc and pulsar system is described in section 2.1 .",
    "evolutionary tracks for several specific combinations of initial conditions are presented and discussed in section 2.2 ( timing properties ) and section 2.3 ( luminosity ) .",
    "we present the statistical timing and luminosity properties of the pulsar population , derived via monte carlo simulations , in section 3.1 , while in section 3.2 we further discuss the luminosity properties of the ns+disc system , and its differences from other astrophysical sources .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section 4 , highlighting puzzling pulsar observations which can be accounted for by the presence of fallback discs .",
    "we model the combined dipole / disc torque acting on the ns ( rotating at angular velocity @xmath10 ) following the approach of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath11 , \\label{eq : torque}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the inner radius of the disc , @xmath13 is the moment of inertia of the ns , @xmath14 ( assuming for simplicity an orthogonal rotator ) , @xmath15 is the accretion rate and @xmath16 is the keplerian angular velocity , both evaluated at @xmath12 . the first term in the r.h.s . of eq.([eq : torque ] ) represents the torque due to dipole radiation losses , whereas the second term describes the torque exerted by the disc . at high accretion rates ,",
    "the ram pressure of the accreting material causes the disc to penetrate inside the magnetosphere , up to an inner radius at which the magnetic pressure balances the ram pressure .",
    "this special location is called the magnetospheric radius , @xmath17 .",
    "if , at any point during the coupled ns+disc evolution , the magnetospheric radius , @xmath18 , formally exceeds the light cylinder radius , @xmath19 , the field lines on the disc are no longer able to exert a significant pressure on the disc . on the other hand , the ram pressure of the material from the accreting disc continues to act . the disc is not able to penetrate inside @xmath20 , because the magnetic pressure from the ns would then push it outwards .",
    "therefore , when @xmath18 becomes formally larger than @xmath20 , we assume that the disc torque is applied at @xmath20 . in summary ,",
    "the inner disc radius is located at @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "inspection of eq.([eq : torque ] ) shows that , at any given time , if @xmath22 , the disc exterts a positive torque , which , if dominant over the dipole component , would make the pulsar spin up and accrete . on the other hand , if @xmath23 , material from the disc is stopped by the centrifugal barrier @xcite , and the disc contributes to furher spin down the pulsar .",
    "formation of the fallback disc ensue as material from the stellar envelope is thrown out at large distances during the supernova explosion ; the fraction of this material which remains bound , falls back , and circularizes onto keplerian orbits corresponding to their original specific angular momentum ( chevalier 1989 ; macfadyen et al . 2001 ; see also perna & macfadyen 2010 for an exploration of different angular momenta distributions in collapsing stars ) .",
    "once the initial disc has been formed , its subsequent evolution can be modelled following the results of the numerical simulations of @xcite .",
    "they showed that the accretion rate in the debris disc follows the evolution @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the accretion rate during an initial plateau phase lasting a timescale @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite estimated the timescale of the transient accretion phase to be on the order of @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the sound speed , @xmath29 the viscosity parameter , @xmath30 the initial disc radius in units of @xmath31 cm , and @xmath32 a typical disc temperature during the early phases , in units of @xmath33 k. the index @xmath34 of the powerlaw decay , was found to be @xmath35 .",
    "a similar behaviour , i.e. a plateau followed by a powerlaw decline , was also found in the simulations by @xcite , although with @xmath36 . here , we adopt @xmath37 for our model .    for an estimate of the expected range of values of the initial accretion rate , we rely on results of numerical simulations of massive star collapse and subsequent fallback onto the compact object .",
    "mineshige et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that the fallback material accretes towards the central object with a supercritical accretion rate , exceeding the eddington limit by at least a factor of @xmath33 .",
    "the simulations of @xcite , for the case of a 25 @xmath38 star , yield @xmath39  g  s@xmath40 .",
    "more recently , fallback in supernovae was studied by zhang , woosley & heger ( 2008 ) for a wide range of masses , and different metallicities and explosion energies .",
    "the full hydrodynamical study in one representative case yielded initial accretion rates of @xmath41  erg  s@xmath40 .",
    "an analysis of sn  1987a ( chevalier 1989 ) showed that the accretion rate at the time of the reverse shock ( @xmath42  s ) is @xmath43  g  s@xmath40 . in general , when considering a distribution of nss , a distribution of initial accretion rates is expected , as this depends on the angular momentum of the progenitor star , its mass , and the energetics of the explosion . in our work ,",
    "to be broadly consistent with the result of previous numerical work , as well as of previous semianalytical investigations which used fallback discs , we select the initial accretion rate @xmath25 to be distributed log - uniformly from @xmath44 to @xmath45",
    ". however , with these values , the mass accretion inflow at early times would be highly supercritical ; that is , it would produce a highly super - eddington luminosity if all the inflowing matter was efficiently accreted through the disc and onto the ns .",
    "the classical eddington limit for a ns , @xmath46 erg s@xmath40 , requires only accretion rates @xmath47 g s@xmath40 , for a radiatively efficient flow .",
    "faced with a highly supercritical accretion flow at the outer boundary , an accreting system has only two options @xcite : it can accrete most of it in a radiatively inefficient way ( _ e.g. _ , the `` polish donut '' or `` slim disc '' classes of accretion flows : @xcite ) ; or it can spend most of the accretion power to blow away the excess infalling mass , in a radiatively driven wind @xcite . for an accreting black hole , observational data and hydrodynamical simulations suggest that the physical situation is a combination of both effects @xcite . for an accreting ns ,",
    "the presence of a hard surface prevents advective solutions : the excess gravitational energy released during accretion can not be carried through a horizon and will always be dissipated , eventually .",
    "therefore , in our model we assume that super - critical inflows on a young ns will lead to massive outflows .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we assume that only @xmath48 reaches the inner edge of the accretion disc ( from where it can then plunge onto the ns ) , regardless of the mass supply at the outer disc ; and that the accretion rate through each radius decreases linearly , @xmath49 , because of radiation - driven wind losses .",
    "thus , we parameterize the radial dependence of the mass flow in the disc at a fixed time as @xmath50 \\frac{r - r_{\\rm in}}{r_{out}-r_{\\rm in}}\\ , , \\label{eq : mdotr}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , for @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , for @xmath54 , is the rate of fallback mass inflow at the outer boundary , and @xmath55 $ ] . in the rest of this paper , for clarity",
    ", we shall use the term `` accretion rate '' when referring to @xmath56 ( what is actually accreted through the whole disc ) , and `` inflow rate '' for @xmath57 at larger radii , most of which is lost in the outflow at early epochs .",
    "( see also @xcite for analytical modelling of accretion discs with a power - law scaling of the inflow rate @xmath58 . )",
    "recalling the definition of magnetospheric radius @xmath18 , it is possible that at early times , when the accretion rate is near eddington , @xmath59 : in that case the disc extends all the way to the ns surface , and we assume the disc torque to be @xmath60 .    at intermediate epochs , when @xmath61 , the wind subsides , and the inflow rate becomes constant thoughout the disc and equal to the accretion rate at the inner edge of the disc . finally , at late times , the accretion rate declines further , until it reaches a value comparable to what is expected from accretion from the interstellar medium . from that epoch",
    "onwards , we take @xmath15 to be constant , @xmath62 g s@xmath40 , equal to the bondi accretion rate @xcite for a medium with characteristic temperature @xmath63 kev and number density @xmath64 @xmath65 . although the precise value of the bondi accretion rate in a low density medium depends on the details of the accretion mode @xcite , our results , which focus on moderately young pulsars , are not very sensitive to the choice of the late - time asymptotic value .",
    "as discussed above , at any time during the pulsar evolution , the disc can either contribute to spinning down the pulsar even more ( with respect to the dipole term alone ) , or it can offset the dipole term and spin the pulsar up .",
    "1 shows , for several values of the accretion rate , the @xmath66 parameter space in which the pulsar spins up ( down ) .    [",
    "fig : pb ]   parameter space in which the pulsar is either spinning up or down , owing to the combined effect of dipole radiation losses and torque by a disc .",
    "for each value of the accretion rate at the magnetospheric radius , the region above its corresponding curve represents the parameter space where the pulsar is spun up , while the region below represents spin down conditions.,title=\"fig:\",width=328 ]    at late times , the torque may disappear if the disc becomes neutral , viscous dissipation drops and accretion stops .",

    "the possible onset of a transition to a phase of dead disc is rather uncertain , as it depends on the nature of viscosity ; opacity ( and hence disc composition ) also plays an important role , as well as the disc size ( menou et al .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out that irradiation by the pulsar is likely to keep the disc ionized and continue the mass inflow ( alpar et al . 2001 ) . here , to avoid introducing highly uncertain parameterizations",
    ", we assume that the disc is active throughout the active lifetime of the pulsar .",
    "if the disc were to become dead at some point , from that time on the pulsar would simply continue its evolution as an isolated pulsar , spinning down by dipole radiation losses alone ( neglecting gravitational energy losses and other secondary effects ) .",
    "the birth distribution of surface magnetic fields and spin periods has been the subject of numerous studies .",
    "usually , a log - gaussian distribution is assumed for both .",
    "for the @xmath70 field distribution , there is now a general consensus about the initial parameters ; following @xcite , we take @xmath71 whether accretion leads to field decay , and the timescale over which the magnetic field re - emerges , are still unsettled issues , especially with regards to quantitative details .",
    "several papers have been devoted to this topic ( e.g. cumming et al .",
    "2001 ; geppert et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the coupled evolution between a ns with a fallback disc and a field gradually buried by the disc accretion has been studied by liu & li ( 2009 ) , using an emphirical expression for @xmath70-field decay presented by shibanazi et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the accreted mass , and @xmath74 is a mass normalization constant with typical values between @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the resulting evolutionary tracks for the periods of the ns studied were found to be very model - dependent , with the magnitude of the effect dependent on both the initial @xmath70 field and the disc properties . in the current work , to avoid results dependent on a rather uncertain parametrization , we consider the case of negligible field burying .",
    "we stress that our investigation is aimed at capturing features of pulsar properties which could be attributed to ns - disc interaction , but we do not make any attempt to quantitatively model data .    for the birth period distribution , on the other hand ,",
    "there is a widely different range of values inferred by different investigations : from a distribution peaking around a few ms @xcite @xmath77 to one peaking at several hundred ms ( faucher - giguere & kaspi 2006 ) @xmath78 a lower limit of several tens of ms was derived from the scarcity of bright x - ray pulsars associated with historical supernovae @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that all those investigations assumed that pulsar evolution occurs with no contribution from fallback torques .",
    "therefore , we use them here as an initial reference point to study the effect that hypothetical fallback discs would have on the pulsar evolution , at a statistical level .",
    "we take an initial spin distribution that encompasses the broad range of values inferred by previous investigations .",
    "in fact , one of the goals of our study is to uncover differences in the effect that a torque by a disc has on nss born with fast and slow spins .",
    "however , we do need to note that it is possible that discs might be much more common around slow - born nss than fast - born nss , since the rotational energy of the latter can rapidly disrupt the disc ( eksi , hernquist & narayan 2005 ) .      +      the presence of a fallback disc torque , in addition to the dipole contribution , can be tested with measurements of the braking index , an observable quantity defined as @xmath79 and of the timing age , @xmath80 where @xmath81 . if the primary source of spin - down is due to dipole radiation losses , then @xmath82 , and the timing age of the pulsar is equal to the real age , if @xmath83 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ntime ] shows the time evolution of the braking index , timing age , and the absolute magnitude of the dipole and disc torques , for four representative pulsars , suitably chosen to represent a wide range of initial birth parameters . for a fixed initial @xmath70 field strength @xmath84 ( defined in eq  [ eq : bdist ] )",
    ", we consider the time - evolution for a typical slow - born ( @xmath85  ms ) and fast - born ( @xmath86  ms ) pulsar , with an initial fallback rate either at the maximum ( @xmath87 g  s@xmath40 ) or at the minimum value ( @xmath88 g  s@xmath40 ) of the assumed distribution .    in order to compute the evolutionary tracks shown in figure  [ fig : ntime ] by means of eq.([eq : braking ] ) and ( [ eq : tau ] ) , we use eq.([eq : torque ] ) to evaluate @xmath89 , from which @xmath90 and @xmath10 are derived through numerical differentiation and numerical integration , respectively .",
    "for the latter , the initial condition is @xmath91 , with @xmath92 or @xmath93 depending on the case .",
    "note that in eq.([eq : torque ] ) , @xmath15 represents the accretion rate at the inner disc boundary , i.e. @xmath94 $ ] , where , recalling from section 2.1 , @xmath95 , for @xmath52 and @xmath96 for @xmath54 .",
    "for each combination of system parameters @xmath84 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , the timing evolution of the ns driven by the coupled disc+dipole torques is therefore uniquely determined .",
    "the result of our calculations is that the disc torque is always negative , that is @xmath99 ( corresponding to a spin down / propeller regime ) , except for a few brief phases when the accretion rate is very high and @xmath100 ( corresponding to a spin up / accretor regime , see also section 2.3 ) .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the disc and dipole torques ( dotted and dashed lines , respectively ) are plotted in figure  [ fig : ntime ] ; the short epochs in which the sign of the disc torque is positive are plotted with red dots ( figure  [ fig : ntime ] , left - hand panels ) .",
    "the presence of significant ( and variable ) disc torques causes the braking index to vary .",
    "more generally , @xmath3 goes through discontinuities caused by transitions between disc - driven spin - up and spin - down phases , between phases of constant accretion rate and powerlaw decay , and when the location of the inner radius of the disc switches between @xmath18 and @xmath101 . in between those rapid transitions , the complex behaviour of the braking index",
    "is mostly determined by the non - linear coupling between ns spin , inner radius of the disc and accretion rate .",
    "in particular , for fast pulsars , the dipole torque largely dominates over the disc torque at early times , while the latter dominates at later times . instead , for slow pulsars , the disc torque is larger than the dipole component at almost all times .",
    "both slow and fast pulsars have a roughly constant braking index during the first few @xmath102 yrs , corresponding to the epoch when @xmath103 constant and @xmath104 . however , the index is exactly @xmath82 for ( dipole - dominated ) fast pulsars , while it is @xmath105 $ ] for ( disc - dominated ) slow pulsars ( from eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "the constancy of @xmath3 in the regime of disc - dominated torque is expected as long as both @xmath56 and @xmath10 are roughly constant .",
    "after the first constant phase , there are three types of discontinuity that can occur on the braking index .",
    "the most dramatic is the transition between spin - down and spin - up phases , which formally results in an infinite value for @xmath3 .",
    "these reversals correspond to switches between ns surface accretion and propeller phases . in our simulations",
    ", they happen only at the high end of the initial fallback rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ntime ] , left - hand panels ) ; for lower inflow rates , the system remains in the propeller phase all the time .",
    "another discontinuity is caused by the transition of the accretion rate at the inner disc radius from the early - time eddington rate to a powerlaw decay .",
    "this discontinuity in @xmath90 will appear only if the disc torque dominates over the dipole torque at the time when @xmath15 undergoes the transition .",
    "last , as discussed earlier , if , at any point during the pulsar evolution , @xmath18 becomes formally larger than @xmath106 , the magnetic pressure of the pulsar is not able to push the disc further out , and hence the inner disc boundary tracks @xmath106 . since the time dependence of @xmath18 ( modulated by @xmath56 ) and that of @xmath106 ( dictated by @xmath10 ) are different , these two radii increase at different rates with time ; hence the inner radius of the disc , @xmath12 , can transition between @xmath18 and @xmath106 ( or viceversa ) during the coupled ns / disc evolution .",
    "any time there is such a transition , the torque in the right side eq.([eq : torque ] ) changes functional form with time , and hence so does @xmath89 .",
    "we need to remark that our semi - analytical treatment of the torque ( eq . [ eq : torque ] ) naturally leads to the transitions between the various phases of the coupled disc / ns evolution to be abrupt . in reality , it is likely that at least some of these transitions will be smoother .",
    "however , we also note that sharp transitions in the period ( and hence discontinuities in its derivative ) are often observed in bynary systems , where the ns dynamics is known to be driven by the disc ( see bildsten et al .",
    "1997 for a comprehensive study ) .",
    "an important feature in the evolution of the braking index is a period of time during which @xmath107 .",
    "this phase sets in when the disc torque begins to dominate over the pulsar torque , and at the same time @xmath108 .",
    "then , the ns spin is driven by the equation @xmath109 , and the braking index can be written as @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is a constant dependent on a combination of the system parameters . for our choice of @xmath112 , @xmath107",
    "if @xmath113 , and the two conditions above are satisfied . in our simulations , we find that the ( short - lived ) @xmath107 phase is a tell - tale feature of fast - born pulsars , but is not seen in slow - born pulsars , because the latter do not go through a phase with @xmath114 .    at late times , we find that the disc torque dominates over the dipole torque both for the slow and the fast pulsars ; @xmath10 and @xmath115 track each other , and the torque evolution is approximately given by @xmath116 $ ] .",
    "the precise time evolution of the torque depends on the index @xmath34 of the accretion rate . for @xmath112 ,",
    "the time dependence is close to @xmath117 , like in the case of a dipole - dominated torque , and @xmath118 .",

    "recall that we are not assuming a constant @xmath15 throughout the disc . as we discussed in section 2.1 , at earlier times @xmath149 because of wind losses .",
    "therefore , during the early super - critical accretion phase , the temperature profile in the inner disc is @xmath150 , flatter than the standard disc - blackbody profile , which scales as @xmath151 .",
    "our choice of accepting an eddington - limited accretion rate at the innermost disc radius and a much higher mass inflow rate at the outer boundary implies that the integrated disc luminosity may exceed @xmath152 at early times .",

    "we accept this possibility of transient super - eddington luminosity as we are modelling a situation characterized by massive outflows rather than a steady - state solution .",
    "a more complex modelling of the accretion flow in that situation with a slim - disc rather than a standard - disc plus outflow approximation is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we begin by exploring the relative magnitude of the various components of the luminosity as a function of ns age , for a few representative combinations of ns and disc parameters . in particular , for the same choice of initial ns spin and disc accretion rate as in fig .",

    "we suggest the following physical interpretation of these results . at the low end of the initial fallback rate",
    ", the ns will never be found in an accretion phase ; hence , both the surface accretion and the boundary layer luminosities will always be negligible . in the 0.1 - 10  kev band",
    ", it is interesting to note that the disc luminosity exceeds that from the ns surface under all choices of parameters , for an age @xmath169  yr .",
    "the higher the accretion rate , the longer is the time over which the disc luminosity exceeds that of the ns ( compare panels labeled with @xmath170 with those labeled @xmath171 in fig.[fig : ltime ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the magnetospheric component of the luminosity due to rotational energy losses , when the pulsar mechanism is active , would produce very high luminosities at early times for millisecond pulsars ( see e.g. perna & stella 2004 ) .",
    "however , spectral modeling can in principle disentangle the thermal disc component from the powerlaw emission from the magnetosphere .",
    "when the initial fallback rate is very high , we have already noted ( section 2.2 ) that , at some epochs , @xmath172 , and the ns is temporarily spun up while accreting . during these transient bright phases ,",
    "the x - ray brightness of the system is dominated by the accretion luminosity onto the surface of the ns .",
    "the exact duration of this transient bright phase , and the time at which it sets in , are a function of @xmath8 , @xmath15 and @xmath70 ; a more detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the physical significance of these accretion - powered phases is that , if fallback discs around pulsars are ubiquitous , and they set in at high accretion rates , then they would give rise to _ a new class of x - ray transients_. furthermore , we note that a sudden increase in brightness could also occur if , at some point during the evolution , the inner radius switches from @xmath173 to @xmath123 , at which point the pulsar mechanism can turn on again .",
    "as already discussed in previous work on fallback discs , the disc is expected to be brighter at wavelengths longer than the x - rays .",
    "this is clearly seen by the mid - ir disc luminosity ( computed in the 3 - 4  @xmath160 m band ) also diplayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ltime ] ; the mid - ir luminosity is , especially at later times ( when the disc is cooler ) , substantially larger than the 2 - 10  kev luminosity ( see @xcite for detailed spectra of fallback discs ) .",
    "searches for fallback discs in the optical and ir have been numerous , but they have mostly yielded upper limits on the emission .",
    "mignani et al .",
    "( 2007a , b ) derived an upper limit on the k luminosity of the pulsar psr  j1119 - 6127 of @xmath174  erg  s@xmath40 .",

    "taken at face value , these limits , once compared with the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : ltime ] , would imply that fallback discs , if ubiquitous around young nss , are unlikely to be accreting at very high rates and/or be very large ( recall that here we have assumed @xmath177 ) .",
    "detection of a fallback disc around an isolated ns was reported by wang et al .",
    "the mid - ir luminosity was @xmath178  erg  s@xmath40 ( for a distance of 5  kpc ) .",
    "this value is compatible with our predictions .",
    "more generally , ir emission has been detected in a number of isolated nss ( see e.g. mignani 2011 for a summary ) .",
    "however , lack of a detailed spectral characterization makes it typically difficult to distinguish between magnetospheric and disc emission .",
    "longer wavelength observations ( in the submillimeter ) have been reported by posselt et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for the isolated ns rx  j1856.5 - 3754 . using the bolometer array on the apex telescope",
    ", they determined a flux limit of 5  mjy at 345  ghz . at the estimated distance of 167",
    "pc , this yields a limit of @xmath179  erg  s@xmath40 on the luminosity .",
    "this value is unconstraining for the discs considered here . and",
    "in fact , posselt et al . (",
    "2010 ) found that it could only set limits on a hypothetical very large outer radius of the disc .",
    "the best prospect for detecting the presence of discs around young nss remains in the optical / ir wavelength range .",
    "we proceed now to simulate how the ubiquitous presence of fallback discs affect the statistical timing properties of the ns population , for a certain birth spin period and magnetic field distribution .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath70 , and the initial disc inflow rate @xmath180 are randomly generated according to their respective distributions discussed in section 2.2 .",
    "for the initial spin , we consider two distributions : one centred at @xmath181 ms ( representative of fast - born pulsars ) and one at @xmath182 ms ( slow - born pulsars ) ; we assume @xmath183 for both distributions . finally , for plotting purposes , we normalize the results to a pulsar birth rate @xmath184 yr@xmath40 .    in order to simulate the distribution of _ observable _ radio pulsars , we need to take into account that the radio emission fades with age . here",
    ", we adopt the death probability band empirically defined by @xcite , centered around the line @xmath185 , where @xmath8 is in the seconds , @xmath186  s / s , and dl@xmath187 .",
    "the radio emission can also be disrupted or modified when the disc penetrates the magnetosphere inside the light cylinder ( e.g. shannon & cordes 2009 for an extensive discussion ) .",
    "this does not affect the long - term evolution of the period and timing properties computed here .",
    "however , if disc penetration inside the magnetosphere were to dim or completely shut down radio emission , then a fraction of pulsars in the sample may not be visible .",
    "previous investigations ( e.g. alpar et al .",
    "2001 ; menou et al 2001a ) assumed the inner edge of the disc to be always located at the light cylinder , throughout the entire evolution of the pulsar , so that radio emission would always be ensured .",
    "however , when the accretion rate is very high , and the ram pressure of the material is larger than the magnetic pressure of the pulsar , there is no compelling reason for imposing that the inner edge of the disc does not penetrate inside the light cylinder .",
    "hence , in this investigation , we let the disc torque operate at its physically expected location , that is the smallest between @xmath18 and @xmath101 , with the understanding that , if @xmath188 the radio signal might be disrupted . with this caveat in mind , in the rest of the paper we conform to the standard language in the literature , and refer to dead pulsars only as to the fraction of pulsars that have passed the death line . for a given distribution of initial parameters ,",
    "we calculate period distributions for both the full ns population ( whether observable or not ) and for the sub - population of observable radio pulsars ( before the death - line cutoff ) .",
    "+        first , we examine the evolution of pulsar periods for the initial short - period distribution and no death - line cutoff .",
    "we show ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pfast ] , left - hand panels ) period distributions that include all the pulsars younger than a certain age , for three different ages .",
    "the top panel shows the evolution due to the combined effect of disc and dipole radiation loss , while the bottom panel shows , for the same initial parameters , the standard evolution due to dipole losses alone . an interesting and perhaps surprising feature of the evolutionary pattern of the spin distribution in the dipole+disc case is that it becomes bimodal .",
    "an inspection of the evolutionary tracks of individual pulsars belonging to each peak shows that the shorter - period peak is produced mostly by nss in which the dipole torque dominates over the disc torque ; hence , the timing evolution of those pulsars is only marginally affected by the presence of the disc , at least when the nss are still relatively young .",
    "this can also be seen by comparison with the lower panel , in which we plot the expected evolution in the absence of disc torques .",
    "another ( relatively small ) contribution to the shorter - period peak comes from nss in the disc - driven spin - up phase , which can bring their spin close to the initial value .",
    "the longer - period peak of the spin distribution , on the other hand , consists of nss in which the disc torque dominates .",
    "we have seen ( section 2.2 ) that disc torques are almost always negative : therefore , disc - dominated nss will more quickly reach longer periods .",
    "a similar period bimodality due to disc torques is also apparent in our simulated distribution of observable radio pulsars , before the death line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pfast ] , right - hand panels ) .    the observed period distribution of isolated pulsars ( atnf pulsar catalogue : manchester at al .",
    "2005 ) is characterized by a dominant broad peak centred around a period of several hundreds milliseconds , and another , much smaller peak , centered around a few milliseconds .",
    "if fallback discs are common around isolated nss , then our results suggest that the millisecond peak might correspond to the small fraction of the ns population which was born with the fastest periods and for which the disc torque was not significant",
    ". however , there may also be a contamination from old , weakly - magnetized recycled pulsars that were spun - up to millisecond periods by disc accretion in a binary system , but have since lost their companion star ( _ eg _ , lorimer et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "our finding that disc accretion leads to a bimodal period distribution is particularly interesting in light of observations of nss in be / x - ray binaries , which accrete material at a relatively high rate ( from a companion , rather than from fallback ) .",
    "these systems display a bimodal period distribution , with one peak centered around @xmath189  s and another around @xmath190  s , previously attributed to two types of sn explosion ( knigge et al 2011 ) .",
    "we propose instead that high rates of disc accretion and the competing effects of dipole and disc torques may have contributed to this bimodality .",
    "we then repeated our monte carlo simulation for the long - period birth distribution .",
    "we find that the period distribution remains single - peaked at all times ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pslow ] ) , in marked contrast to the short - period birth case .",
    "the reason is that when the initial periods are long , the disc torque dominates over the entire life of the pulsars , for the greatest majority of pulsars .",
    "[ fig : tau - and - n ] shows the distribution of timing ages and braking indices versus real age for the full pulsar distribution ; we have also distinguished pulsars above and below the death line .",
    "a variable birth rate ( higher for the younger objects ) has been assumed in order to sample pulsars of different ages more uniformly .",
    "the fast - born pulsar distribution shows two clusterings , one at @xmath118 and another at @xmath107 : the former from the younger and older pulsars , and the latter for the intermediate phase discussed in section 2.2 .",
    "note how a large fraction of pulsars has @xmath191 , but there can be some very large values .",
    "the pulsar distribution with slow initial spins , on the other hand , is largely concentrated in the range @xmath0 , plus a subset of spinning - up sources found predominantly with @xmath192 . timing",
    "ages are generally smaller than the real ages for the older objects , and larger than the real ages for the younger nss .",
    "braking indices have been measured for a number of pulsars .",
    "interestingly , indices smaller than 3 are rather common , and most often with values between 2 and 3 ( e.g. livingstone et al . 2005a , b , 2006 ) , with sometimes values smaller than 2 ( lyne et al .",
    "this is the natural range of values predicted by fallback discs , as we have shown .",
    "we have seen in section 2.1 that the initial inflow rate from a fallback disc can be much larger than the critical value at large radii , and the emitted bolometric luminosity can exceed the eddington limit by a logarithmic factor . in our model , during this initial phase , the mass inflow at large radii declines as @xmath193 , and most of the inflow is lost in a wind when @xmath194 .",
    "we have also shown that the decay timescale is @xmath195@xmath6 s for typical disc parameters .",
    "thus , the supercritical phase of accretion has a very short duration .",
    "the rapid decline in the disc luminosity is due to the combined effect of the decline in the accretion rate , and the increase of the magnetospheric radius , which defines the inner truncation radius of the disc .",
    "note that the disc luminosity in the x - ray band , being produced in the inner parts of the disc , is especially sensitive not only to the magnitude of the accretion rate , but also to the spin period of the ns .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that the inner radius of the disc , @xmath12 , being determined by the minimum between @xmath18 and @xmath106 , depends on both @xmath15 ( through @xmath18 ) , and on @xmath10 ( through @xmath106 ) .",
    "the longer - wavelength emission , on the other hand , being produced at larger disc radii , is less sensitive to the precise location of the inner radius , and hence it has also little sensitivity on the spin period of the ns .",
    "the characteristic peak disc temperature is @xmath196 with our chosen range of initial inflow rates , we find that the peak temperature is @xmath197 k @xmath198 kev for an initial period of time lasting @xmath199@xmath6 yr , and then declines @xmath200 afterwards .",
    "thus , fallback discs are always much cooler than accretion discs in ns x - ray binaries , even when they are both near the eddington luminosity .",
    "this is because the magnetic field of an old ns in an x - ray binary is generally weaker than in a young pulsar - fields ; this observational evidence is based on the x - ray spectra , the luminosity at which they switch from propeller to accretor , and also on the existence of recycled millisecond pulsars , which could not be spun up to millisecond periods if they had a high magnetic field . ] , and the disc can extend closer to the innermost stable circular orbit or the ns surface , reaching peak temperatures @xmath201@xmath202 kev .",
    "this is also the reason why disc accretion tends to spin down young pulsars and spin up old pulsars . in summary , we expect the direct luminosity effect of a fallback disc to be a super - soft component in addition to the thermal component from the ns surface .",
    "a noteworthy result of our analysis is that at early times , @xmath203  yr , the 0.1 - 10  kev luminosity from the disc is expected to exceed the luminosity from the ns surface for the range of initial accretion rates considered here , @xmath204  g  s@xmath40 .",
    "this is especially so for millisecond pulsars , since at early times @xmath123 , and hence the inner radius of the disc is smaller for shorter - period nss .",
    "lack of detection of this disc component in young nss would argue against an ubiquitous formation of fallback discs , or that the initial accretion rates are lower than what numerical simulations suggest . in millisecond pulsars",
    ", discs could be blown away by the pulsars themselves ( eksi et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "lastly , to conclude our discussion of the luminosity , note that , when the non - thermal magnetospheric component is enabled , it would likely dominate in the 2 - 10  kev band at least for the fastest pulsars . in this case",
    ", our model suggests that the x - ray colours and spectral appearance of a young pulsar with a fallback disc truncated at the magnetospheric radius would be somewhat similar to those observed in the largest class of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( feng & soria 2011 for a review ) , dominated by a power - law component of photon index @xmath205 , with a soft excess at @xmath206@xmath207 kev and possibly a radiation - driven disc outflow .",
    "this is likely to be a coincidence due to the relative scaling of accretor mass , accretion rate in eddington units , and characteristic inner - disc radius in the two classes of objects .",
    "if the thermal component of the luminosity in both classes of objects is eddington limited , young pulsars with fallback discs will be one or two orders of magnitude less luminous than ultraluminous x - ray sources with cool discs , and there would not be possibility of misidentification if the distance is known .",
    "another main difference is that the x - ray luminous phase of a fallback disc lasts only @xmath208 yr , which implies that such sources must be found very close to their natal supernova remnant ; instead , ultraluminous x - ray sources are thought to be active for @xmath209 yr and they are very rarely associated with supernova remnants .",
    "moreover , the characteristic inner radius of the standard disc in power - law dominated ultraluminous x - ray sources tends to increase with the accretion rate ( for example , @xmath210 if it corresponds to the spherization radius ) , in the supercritical regime ; as a result , the thermal component becomes cooler but more luminous @xcite .",
    "instead , the inner radius of a disc truncated at the magnetospheric boundary will be pushed outwards as the accretion rate declines ( assuming that the ns magnetic field varies more slowly than the accretion rate ) : @xmath211 , implying @xmath212 and @xmath213 . at late times",
    ", the disc becomes too faint and cool to be detectable in the x - ray band .",
    "then the best prospects for direct detection are at longer wavelengths , especially in the ir .",
    "fallback discs have been suggested to be a common outcome of supernova explosions . in this paper",
    "we have explored some of the consequences of their presence for the timing and spectral properties of the associated ns population . to this purpose",
    ", we have modelled the torque and luminosity of fallback discs around young pulsars , with a range of values for the initial spin and dipole magnetic field .",
    "relying on the results of numerical simulations of massive star collapse , we assumed that the initial inflow rate of fallback material at large radii is highly supercritical , but most of the inflow is blown away in a radiatively driven wind , so that the accretion rate at the inner edge of the disc is eddington limited .",
    "we considered two initial distributions of spin periods : one with a gaussian distribution centred at 5 ms , and one centred at 300 ms , with a birth rate proportional to the sfr ( assumed constant ) .",
    "we evolved the period distribution of the two populations over time , under the combined effect of dipole and fallback disc torques .",
    "the main outcomes of our analysis are summarized below .    1 .",
    "we find that , within the wide range of initial parameters explored , the effect of a fallback disc is mostly a spin - down .",
    "matter from the disc is propelled out rather than being accreted on the ns surface , except for a few short phases when the accretion rate is very high . during these phases , which can last up to several thousand years",
    ", the ns - disc system brightens up in x - rays to a luminosity that can reach the eddington value , and the ns is spun up to levels that can bring the spin close to its initial value .",
    "if fallback discs are common , they substantially affect our estimates of the initial spin birth of pulsars ( which generally assume spin down losses due to dipole radiation alone ) .",
    "in particular , the period distribution of fast - born pulsars is predicted to evolve towards a bimodal distribution , unlike the distribution in the absence of fallback discs , which remains single - peaked if it started as such . on the other hand , for slow - born pulsars ,",
    "the main long - term effect is simply a shift of the distribution to longer periods .",
    "timing ages as measured for the ns / disc system generally overestimate real ages for young pulsars , and underestimate it for old pulsars .",
    "braking indices cluster in the range @xmath214 for slow - born pulsars ( apart from a short - lived spin - up phase with @xmath215 ) , and @xmath1 for fast - born pulsars .",
    "younger objects tend to have @xmath2 .",
    "large values of @xmath3 , while not common , are possible , and associated to phase transitions in the pulsar - disc system .",
    "4 .   in addition to changing the spin evolution of a pulsar ( and therefore also its rotation - powered x - ray luminosity )",
    ", a fallback disc can be directly detected as a bright source in a broad wavelength range .",
    "we found that at early times , the characteristic inner - disc temperature @xmath216 kev for typical initial values of the magnetic field , @xmath217 gauss , and eddington - limited accretion , and declines as @xmath212 at later epochs .",
    "the disc has a low temperature compared with typical accretion discs in ( older ) ns x - ray binaries , because it is truncated at the magnetospheric radius .",
    "the 0.1 - 10  kev luminosity generally exceeds that of the ns surface at early times , if the initial accretion rates are highly supereddington .",
