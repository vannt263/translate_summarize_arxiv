    "quantum dot devices , or so - called artificial atoms , consist of a small electronic nanostructure tunnel coupled to source and drain leads . in the coulomb - blockade regime ,",
    "sequential ( one - electron ) tunneling transport is exponentially suppressed and processes where two or more electrons tunnel simultaneously become the dominant transport mechanism .",
    "@xcite among such correlated tunneling processes , _ cotunneling _ has received a lot of interest in recent years .",
    "cotunneling denotes a two - electron tunneling process which can transfer an electron coherently from source to drain by a virtual population of an energetically forbidden charge state of the nanostructure .",
    "as energy is gained from the voltage drop during the electron transfer , a cotunneling event can leave the structure in an excited state , in which case one speaks of _ inelastic cotunneling_. otherwise the energy state of the island is left unchanged and the process is called _ elastic_.    inelastic cotunneling spectroscopy has turned out to be a useful tool to identify electronic , magnetic and vibrational excitations in semiconducting  @xcite or carbon nanotube based  @xcite quantum dots as well as in single - molecule junctions .",
    "@xcite most importantly , the positions of conductance peaks provide a very direct fingerprint of the excitation spectrum of the tunnel - coupled nanostructure , but also the more detailed bias - dependence or _ line - shape _ of such inelastic cotunneling peaks contains valuable information . by",
    "now , it is well understood  @xcite how the non - equilibrium pumping of excited states by the applied bias voltage can give rise to a cusp in the region where the bias voltage matches the relevant excitation energy .",
    "this effect is maximal for a symmetric setup .",
    "having very different tunnel couplings to respectively source and drain electrodes implies that the nanostructure ( dot or molecule ) is almost equilibrated with one electrode and this effect no longer shows up .",
    "this was confirmed by an experiment by parks et al . where the opening and closing of a mechanical break junction holding a @xmath1 molecule was shown to correlate with the weakening and strengthening of such non - equilibrium cusps near the threshold for excitation of a vibrational mode in the system .",
    "@xcite        in the present paper we investigate the non - equilibrium cotunneling in a variety of complex quantum dot systems . for systems designed to have low - energy excitations arising from weakly broken degeneracies we find a characteristic gate dependence of the non - equilibrium modulation of the inelastic cotunneling steps .",
    "on one side of the coulomb diamond , we find the characteristic cusped increase in conductance at threshold , but on the other side of the diamond this turns into a weakening of the conductance at threshold which renders the nonlinear conductance entirely monotonous in bias .",
    "we show how this comes about by an asymmetry in the cotunneling amplitudes for processes which add or remove one electron from the dot ( `` particle - hole asymmetry '' ) .",
    "this adds an important piece of information to the spectroscopic toolbox insofar as such a non - equilibrium depression of the cotunneling step in a symmetrically coupled device should not be mistaken for a tunnel broadened or thermally smeared cotunneling step in a very asymmetrically coupled system : such causes would lead to depression of the cotunneling steps at _ both _ sides of the coulomb blockade diamond . in contrast , the pecularity of our intrinsic effect is that a depression will occur only on one side , while on the other the conductance will retain the typical cusped increase .    the systems we study are all coupled _ symmetrically _ to source and drain so as to maximize the non - equilibrium effects under scrutiny .",
    "they are chosen according to increasing complexity , namely a lateral double - dot ( dd ) , a triangular triple - dot ( td ) and a benzene molecule . in all cases only two dots ( or sites in the benzene ) are tunnel coupled to the leads , see figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "for the triple dot as well as for benzene , this induces not only a breaking of the symmetry under rotations by @xmath2 respectively @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , but also a degeneracy lifting : while the on - site energies of all uncoupled sites can be normalized to zero , the contact sites have to be endowed with a different on - site energy @xmath5 to mimic the symmetry breaking which is likely to result from either tunneling renormalization  @xcite or electrostatic effects  @xcite .    to calculate the current and other observables in transport through quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime",
    "there are a number of techniques , each with their advantages and limitations .",
    "following a real - time transport approach as described in refs .",
    "@xcite , one can trace out the leads degrees of freedom to derive a formally exact generalized master equation ( gme ) for the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) of the system .",
    "this approach allows for a systematic expansion in the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath6 , thus capturing sequential tunneling from contributions of second order in @xmath6 and cotunneling as a fourth order process .",
    "the gme has the advantage that it is exact to a desired order .",
    "however , already at fourth order in @xmath6 the number of terms is quite large and therefore it is often practical to use simpler approaches which capture only the most relevant contributions for each order of the perturbation theory .    in this work ,",
    "we focus entirely on the coulomb blockade regime and we shall therefore calculate cotunneling rates within the @xmath0-matrix approach .  @xcite this approach is much simpler than the gme , and will be valid _ deep inside _ a coulomb diamond , even with the further approximations of _ i ) _ neglecting the sequential tunneling contributions , and _",
    "ii ) _ approximating the denominators in the rates as independent of the lead electron energy . to ensure that all details in the _ lineshapes _ for which we aim are correct , we benchmark",
    "the above mentioned approximations as well as the @xmath0-matrix technique itself by a quantitative comparison to the gme approach . in general",
    ", we find the @xmath0-matrix and the gme approach to be in good agreement when additional effects due to level shifts and broadening are irrelevant , namely in the regime where the tunneling induced level broadening is much smaller than the temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce the model hamiltonian and the relevant expression to calculate the current and conductance in terms of transition rates is provided . in the end of this section , we discuss different approximations to the rates .",
    "these approximation schemes are compared against exact fourth order results in section [ sec : approaches ] for the case of a double - dot model .",
    "the triple dot and the benzene molecule are investigated in section [ sec : wbd ] and the results are analyzed analytically using the simplest of these approximations .",

    "a generic quantum dot coupled to source and drain leads is described by the hamiltonian @xmath9 source and drain leads are represented by two reservoirs of non - interacting electrons : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 stands for the left or right lead .",
    "the chemical potentials @xmath12 of the leads depend on the applied bias voltage @xmath13 , which is assumed to be applied symmetrically across the two junctions , so that @xmath14 . in the following",
    "we will measure the energy starting from the equilibrium chemical potential @xmath15 .",

    "they can be described as two or more ( @xmath16 ) localized states coupled among each other . following the semi - empirical modeling of benzene ,  @xcite we study here model hamiltonians given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the on - site energy of the level @xmath19 . in section [ sec : wbd ] we will set @xmath20 , except for the two sites coupled to the contacts , for which we assume @xmath21 , establishing a weakly broken degeneracy .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 describes the hopping of electrons between nearest neighboring states @xmath23 .",

    "the first term accounts for the influence of a gate voltage @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being the gate coupling parameter .",
    "its actual value strongly depends on the fabrication technique used for creating the quantum dot ,  @xcite and typically ranges in order of magnitude from @xmath28-@xmath29 .",
    "as it simply acts as a scaling factor on the gate voltage , we can set @xmath30 throughout this paper without loss of generality .",
    "the leads couple only to some of these localized states and the corresponding tunneling hamiltonian is described by @xmath31 where @xmath32 creates an electron in the single particle state @xmath33 which couples to lead @xmath34 .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath6 is treated as a perturbation to @xmath35 . in this work",

    "( [ eq : mqd ] ) , connected to source and drain as illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "we give an overview of their relevant properties in sections [ sec : approaches ] and [ sec : wbd ] .",
    "as we shall show , weakly broken degeneracies in the td and benzene give rise to qualitatively different inelastic cotunneling profiles at different gate - voltages .",
    "this is in contrast to the dd which has a non - degenerate ground state and therefore less structure in its cotunneling amplitudes .      to make calculations easier",
    ", we shall assume @xmath37 .",
    "here , @xmath38 is the addition energy , which can in principle be expressed in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , but with increasing number of sites in an increasingly unhandy way .",
    "the value of the level broadening @xmath39 must stay well below the thermal energy @xmath40 in order to justify a perturbative approach to transport .",
    "the degeneracy lifting @xmath5 is much smaller than the addition energy @xmath38 , but exceeds both @xmath39 and the thermal energy by far . in this case , the reduced density matrix remains diagonal , because one can exclude coherences between the no longer degenerate states , and the rate equations are simpler .",
    "@xcite moreover , normal metal leads are considered , such that a rate equation approach to transport is sufficient .    for the sequential tunneling rates , a gme approach  @xcite yields the same result as fermi s golden rule with @xmath41 being the perturbation .",
    "the latter scheme can be iterated to include higher order tunneling processes by making use of the @xmath0-matrix @xmath42 from which transition rates from the initial to the final state can be calculated up to a given order in @xmath6 .",
    "+ in general , the emerging @xmath0-matrix rates differ from the corresponding gme rates .",

    "( [ eq : tm ] ) going to zero . by construction",
    "the @xmath0-matrix misses in each order contributions guaranteeing these exclusion via a cancellation of reducible terms .",
    "therefore unavoidable divergences emerge with the @xmath0-matrix technique from fourth order in the perturbation and onwards .",
    "@xcite meanwhile , regularization schemes to remove the divergence appearing in the fourth order @xmath0-matrix rates have become standard ,  @xcite and the @xmath0-matrix approach has been applied to various setups , e.g. to a double dot structure  @xcite or to molecular systems where electronic and vibronic degrees of freedom can be strongly coupled  @xcite . in this context , it is important to stress that the standard way of regularizing the @xmath0-matrix rates does not exactly reproduce the gme intrinsic regularization , but the discrepancy between @xmath0-matrix and exact perturbation theory turns out to vanish deep inside the coulomb blockade .",
    "the same holds for further fourth order contributions included by the gme which can not necessarily be brought into the form of a squared matrix element  @xcite and are disregarded by the @xmath0-matrix approach . + we label now the states of the quantum dot with their particle number @xmath43 , the @xmath44-component of their spin with @xmath45 and an additional quantum number with @xmath46",

    "the origin of this cusp lies in the non - equilibrium redistribution of the occupation probabilities of the two orbitals . for bias voltages below the threshold ,",

    "the elastic cotunneling conductance is set by the prefactor to @xmath182 in eq .",

    "this implies that a monotonous increase of the conductance across the threshold will be accompanied by a large step - height , i.e. a large difference between the conductance at @xmath183 and at @xmath184 .",

    "the excited states contribute as well , but less due to the energy difference in the denominator , and their influence will not change the qualitative behavior of the differential conductance .",
    "it is therefore necessary to analyze separately the matrix elements @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "these are compared in figure  [ fig : levelsvsxi ] , where we also investigate the behavior of the quasi degenerate levels as a function of the degeneracy lifting @xmath5 .",
    "plotting the energies of the two levels with @xmath151 versus @xmath5 , we see that for @xmath198 , the state with @xmath199 is the ground state , but for @xmath200 the state with @xmath180 has lower energy .",
    "the overall dependence of the matrix elements on @xmath5 is rather weak , but the coupling to the ground states with @xmath98 electrons of these two states is seen to be very different .",
    "the matrix element of the @xmath201 ground state with @xmath199 is about twice as large as the one with @xmath180 , while for the elements with the @xmath202 ground state , this situation is reversed .",

    "in conclusion , we investigated cotunneling phenomena in complex quantum dot systems and demonstrated that systems with weakly broken degeneracies can exhibit a marked gate - voltage dependence of the nonlinear cotunneling conductance traces .",

    "@xcite , the inelastic cotunneling thresholds were shown to acquire a gate - dependence due to the difference in tunneling - induced level - shifts for the two different levels involved .",
    "whereas that effect shows up with only tunnel coupling to a single lead , it is important to recognize that the gate - dependent modulation of the step which we discuss here relies entirely on the coupling to two different leads . entering the kondo regime for which such level - shifts become important , both effects",
    "could be observed simultaneously and therefore it would be interesting to study this stronger coupled regime more closely in future studies .    from the technical point of view",
    ", we have demonstrated that the widely used simplification of the @xmath0-matrix approach ( ) is indeed in _ quantitative _ agreement with the exact fourth order perturbation theory ( gme ) in regions of gate and bias - voltage for which sequential tunneling resonances are strongly suppressed . with a poorer separation of energy scales ,",
    "i.e. when the inelastic cotunneling threshold is no longer much smaller than the charging energy , is insufficient but approximation and the @xmath0-matrix approach still perform very well and have a fairly large range of validity , within which they yield good agreement with the gme results . in particular",
    ", they describe very well the lineshape of the inelastic cotunneling conductance for systems with weakly broken degeneracies , i.e. , with @xmath211 . gives rise to substantial simplifications and allows writing occupation numbers and current in closed analytic form , despite the potential complexity of the underlying quantum dot systems which is now wrapped up in the virtual transition - amplitudes comprising the effective exchange - cotunneling matrix - elements , see eq .",
