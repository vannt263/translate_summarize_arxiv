    "the totem experiment at lhc provides , in fact , the first measurements of soft pomeron contribution ( more exactly of pomeron and odderon ) because the contributions of secondary or subasymptotic reggeons are very small at such high energies .",
    "it means that the precise measurement of @xmath1 total and differential cross sections @xcite gives a possibility to discriminate the various pomeron models by comparing their predictions with new data . generally speaking the totem results are going to be a strong restriction for various phenomenological pomeron models @xcite .",
    "many of them being directly extrapolated to 7 tev could not describe the recent totem data though they are in a good agreement with data at @xmath61.96 tev . moreover , even basing on the total cross section measurement at 7 and 8 tev only one can conclude that @xmath7 rises with energy faster than @xmath8 .",
    "therefore some of the models have to be rejected despite its excellent agreement with the data available before lhc epoch .",
    "for example , the dipole pomeron model with trajectory intercept @xmath9 ( see @xcite and references therein ) is unable to give @xmath10 mb at @xmath11 tev .",
    "the current state of elastic scattering model market is given in @xcite and in the comprehensive review @xcite .",
    "obviously , all the models must be verified for a consistency with new data .",
    "many of them , if not the all , require some modification to be successfully extrapolated to new data .    in @xcite",
    "such a procedure was performed for the eikonal @xcite and @xmath12-matrix @xcite models .",
    "it was shown that adding the second odderon term solves the problem only partially , a further modification of the model is necessary .",
    "eikonal and @xmath12-matrix models are treated as infinite series of multiple input reggeon exchanges .",
    "however another approach to constructing model is also possible .",
    "one can just take into account unitarity and analyticity requirements from the beginning as well as experimental information on the cross sections ( e.g. increase of total cross sections ) to determine the form of amplitude .",
    "following this idea in @xcite we have suggested the tripole pomeron - odderon model of elastic @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering amplitudes and compared it with data .",
    "amplitudes in the model at very high energies are dominated by pomeron contribution which corresponds to pair of the branch points colliding at @xmath0 and at the angular momentum @xmath13 to generate a triple pole . besides the set of the preasymptotic terms , even and odd ,",
    "have been incorporated in the model .",
    "structure of leading singularities is different from those of the well - known the maximal pomeron and odderon model @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the model @xcite is in a good agreement with the data in a wide interval of energy and momenta transferred , but now we have found that those model without changes fail to describe the recent totem @xmath14 data .    in the present paper we are focused on our parametrization of the tripole pomeron - odderon model @xcite exploring its simplified form ( neglecting the cut contributions unimportant at high energies ) .",
    "this model in ref .",
    "@xcite was applied at @xmath15 6 gev@xmath5 .",
    "we add two additional terms decreasing at high @xmath16 as @xmath17 in order to extend model for larger @xmath16 .",
    "such terms allow us ( as it was shown in @xcite ) to describe the @xmath14 data at @xmath18 6 gev@xmath5 ) .",
    "we remind the important properties of the tripole pomeron - odderon model , argue its modification for high @xmath16 , then we present the results of the fit and give predictions for the totem measurements at higher energies and @xmath16 .",
    "as it was stressed in @xcite the contribution to the partial amplitude of a triple pole with linear trajectory @xmath19^{3}}\\ ] ] violates the unitarity inequality @xmath20 .",
    "the correct pomeron singularity dominating the partial wave is the following @xmath21^{3/2}}.\\ ] ] the black disk model holds the same singularity of the partial amplitude .",
    "the imaginary part of black disk amplitude in the impact parameter representation has a step - like form with the height 1/2 and the width equal to @xmath22 .",
    "it leads to @xmath23 gev@xmath5 .",
    "it seems to be natural to keep the same structure of singularity for subleading terms changing only their multiplicity .",
    "our choice of subleading terms is the following @xmath24},\\ ] ] @xmath25^{1/2}},\\ ] ] @xmath26 thus the leading pomeron contribution to partial amplitude has a form @xmath27    taking into account that @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the bessel functions , one can write the main pomeron part of amplitude in the @xmath32-representation @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the vertex functions with @xmath35 , @xmath36 is defined below by exp.([eq : zvar ] ) , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 gev@xmath5 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are constants .    strictly speaking the amplitudes in regge models depend on @xmath41 through the @xmath42 , cosine of the scattering angle in @xmath43-channel , which for @xmath1 scattering in the center mass system has the form @xmath44 in the considered kinematical region the @xmath43 in the numerator of eq .",
    "[ eq : costetha ] can be neglected .",
    "however we keep @xmath45 because for @xmath0 we take into account the data on cross sections at low energies , @xmath46 5 gev . absorbing factor @xmath47 into the vertex functions we define the energy variable as the following @xmath48    we propose to keep the same singularity structure for the leading terms of crossing - odd part of amplitude .",
    "however , taking into account the fact that there is no visible odderon contribution at @xmath0 we multiply each odderon term by factor @xmath43 @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the constants .",
    "we would like to emphasize that similar ( but not the same ) models for @xmath52 and @xmath53 were considered in @xcite .",
    "these models have the same dominating even term @xmath54 but the different subasymptotic terms @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "the odderon terms included in those amplitudes do not vanish at @xmath0 .",
    "the properties of the models @xcite and their defects have been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "they were modified in @xcite , defects were eliminated and a good description of data at energies up to 1.8 tev has been obtained . however , as was noticed in @xcite such a maximal odderon term ( @xmath57 in our notations ) gives rise to the contradiction with unitarity in the models where @xmath58 at @xmath59 . in despite of this fact we refit the model @xcite ( without the cuts important only at low energies ) at the energies @xmath60 19 gev , including totem data , but we are fail to describe the data qualitatively .      in @xcite",
    "the described model was applied to analysis of the @xmath14 data at @xmath60 6 gev , where not only contributions of the pomeron and secondary reggeons but also their rescatterings ( or cuts ) are very important . besides , the considered momenta transfer were restricted by @xmath61 gev@xmath5 . here",
    "we would like to check a principal possibility of the model to describe an interpolation between gev and tev energy region .",
    "we investigate as well which amplitude terms are important for that and which form of vertex functions @xmath62 is more suitable for @xmath14 at @xmath63 gev@xmath5 .",
    "thus we consider high energy @xmath1 and @xmath2 elastic scattering , starting from fnal energy 19 gev .",
    "we do hope that in this energy interval we can neglect at least all cuts reducing the number of adjustable parameters .",
    "these terms are important at lower energies but their parametrization should be chosen being consistent with good description of high energy data .",
    "we keep in amplitudes also the standard `` soft '' pomeron and odderon , simple @xmath64-poles with linear trajectories @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 to describe the behaviour of the @xmath68 at low energy and low @xmath16 the usual secondary crossing - even and odd reggeons ( @xmath69 reggeons with intercepts @xmath70 ) have to be included in the amplitudes .",
    "however , analyzing @xmath1 and @xmath2 amplitudes only it is sufficient to consider at @xmath60 5 gev one effective even reggeon and one effective odd reggeon @xmath71    a preliminary analysis of the data was performed to understand how a behavior of @xmath14 ( at @xmath63 gev@xmath5 ) can be described .",
    "we found that a correct description of these data is provided by the terms behaving as @xmath72 at large @xmath16 ( which are almost independent on @xmath41 ) .",
    "therefore we add to the amplitudes crossing even and odd terms @xmath73 and @xmath74 with arbitrary phases .",
    "to decrease an influence of these terms on the amplitudes at small @xmath16 we introducing the factor @xmath75",
    ". it would be reasonable to construct them in a more customary ( regge - like ) form at small @xmath43 and power - like behaving at large @xmath43 .",
    "but as we noticed above our aim is , first of all , to check some principal possibilities of the tripole pomeron and odderon models .",
    "therefore to avoid an extra number of parameters we choose these terms in a simplified form @xmath76 @xmath77 thus the @xmath1 and @xmath2 amplitudes in a general case are defined as following @xmath78 where @xmath79 are given by eqs .",

    "the vertices for secondary reggeons @xmath85 are chosen in an exponential form @xmath86 @xmath85 are negligible at high @xmath16 because of large slopes of their trajectories .",
    "however these terms of amplitude become important at small @xmath16 where exponential vertices are reasonable .",

    "* there are no any unusual or unexpected phenomena in new totem data .",

    "we believe that successful description of the data in the considered models results from the well tuned structure of pomeron and odderon singularities ( eqs .",

    "thus , it allow us to conclude that the model is quite stable under variations of the preasymptotic components and the form of vertex functions .",
