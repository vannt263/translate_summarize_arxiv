    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most of which are thought to contain a neutron star , @xmath5 nss are known . yet a neutron star is born in the milky way every @xmath6 to @xmath7 years , suggesting that the total population is @xmath8 objects ( or roughly @xmath9 of the stars ) , depending on the galaxy s star formation history @xcite . of these neutron stars ,",
    "only the youngest will be detected as radio pulsars , provided they are aligned favorably ; after a few million years , the pulsar will have radiated away its rotational and internal energy , and the pulses will cease @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the total number of pulsars in the milky way is only a few times @xmath10 ; for every active pulsar there are @xmath11 radio - quiet neutron stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that some of these defunct pulsars could reheat by accreting matter from the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) through bondi - hoyle accretion .",
    "the ism would need to be relatively dense , the ns velocity relatively low , and the ns magnetic field somewhat decayed to allow accreting matter to reach the star s surface ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "if these conditions are met , the neutron star might emit approximately as a blackbody with a peak in the extreme ultraviolet / soft x - ray energy band @xcite .",
    "for nearby nss , this thermal emission is observable , and it was thought that @xmath0 would detect @xmath12 to @xmath13 reheated isolated neutron stars ( inss ) , thereby potentially providing strong constraints on the neutron star equation of state ( eos ) ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "yet today the list of @xmath0-detected radio - quiet isolated neutron stars contains just seven entries ( for a recent review of the so - called magnificent seven , see * ? ? ?",
    "recent work has suggested at least one plausible explanation for this discrepancy between the predicted and the observed numbers of inss : bondi - hoyle accretion may not be an adequate mechanism for reheating large numbers of inss , in part because the conditions described above are unrealistic ( particularly if one considers the observed pulsar velocity distribution ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , @xcite have suggested instead that at the bright end of the x - ray log n - log s distribution , where most ins searches have taken place , the current number of known inss is compatible with population models for young , cooling neutron stars .",
    "this is consistent with observations of the magnificent seven suggesting they may have magnetic fields and velocities too large for bondi - hoyle accretion .",
    "while the x - ray characteristics of the magnificent seven are broadly consistent with thermal emission , the current sample has managed to be both too small and too diverse in detail to definitively address the neutron star eos .",
    "for example , while at least five of the seven are x - ray pulsars @xcite , the upper limit for the amplitude of x - ray pulsations in rx j1856.5@xmath143754 , the brightest known ins , is @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "in addition , rather than bland blackbody spectra , x - ray spectroscopy of four of the seven has revealed unexpected broad absorption features @xcite . the nature and significance of each of these differences",
    "are also topics of current debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although some have argued that all the observational evidence is consistent with blackbody emission altered by the presence of a hydrogen atmosphere and magnetic fields of differing intensities @xcite .",
    "clearly , if we are to find unifying patterns by which to disentangle the various possible roles of magnetic fields , geometry , and atmospheres , obtaining a larger sample of inss is required , especially to make eventual progress towards understanding the fundamental questions of the neutron star eos .    in the past ,",
    "a major obstacle to finding isolated neutron stars was the absence of a large - area optical survey of equivalent sensitivity with which to identify the @xmath16 x - ray sources cataloged in the @xmath0 all - sky survey ( rass , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the availability of a suitable companion optical survey would allow removal of `` contaminants '' to ins searches ( i.e. , the bulk of more common x - ray - emitting subclasses : quasars , bright stars , clusters of galaxies , etc . ) , thereby narrowing the list of rass error circles in which to search for new inss .",
    "@xcite attempted to identify candidate inss from among the @xmath17 rass sources in the bright source catalog ( bsc , * ? ? ? * ) by eliminating matches to the united states naval observatory ( usno ) a@xmath18 optical catalog , but in the interim the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has emerged as a more powerful companion optical survey to rass , especially for extending the search for new inss to the rass faint source catalog ( fsc , * ? ? ?",

    "section 3 describes the method used to select our candidate fields , and in section 4 we describe the properties of the individual candidate fields identified by this program .",
    "section 5 is a discussion of our results and includes a comparison of our method and that of @xcite , an earlier search for inss that also used the rass .- detected x - ray sources without optical counterparts to the guide star catalog faint limit of @xmath19 mag ( depending on the optical band and the source position on the sky ) .",
    "these are high resolution imager observations , and the area of sky covered and the x - ray error circles are both much smaller than for the rass .",
    "] we conclude in section 6 .",
    "the @xmath0 all - sky survey ( rass ) was the first of its kind in soft x rays ( @xmath20  kev ) . using the position sensitive proportional counter , @xmath0 imaged the sky with exposures of lengths ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 s at the ecliptic equator and poles , respectively , with @xmath23 of the sky observed in exposures at least @xmath24 seconds long @xcite .",
    "the typical limiting sensitivity of the resulting rass catalog is a few times @xmath25  ergs  @xmath26  s@xmath27 , and more than @xmath28 sources are included when one merges the rass bright and faint source catalogs @xcite .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey provides a uniform optical photometric and spectroscopic dataset with which to correlate the rass catalog .",
    "sdss is currently mapping the sky at optical wavelengths using a dedicated 2.5  m telescope at the apache point observatory , new mexico , and producing homogeneous five color _ u , g , r , i , z _ ccd images to a depth of @xmath29 @xcite , with associated photometry accurate to @xmath30 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "astrometric accuracy is better than @xmath31 per coordinate ( rms ) for sources with @xmath32 @xcite ; morphological information drawn from sdss images allows for reliable star / galaxy separation to @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the survey s coverage of @xmath34  deg@xmath35 around the north galactic cap and of @xmath36  deg@xmath35 in the southern galactic hemisphere will result in photometric measurements for over @xmath37 stars and a similar number of galaxies .",
    "sdss will also obtain spectra for @xmath38 galaxies and @xmath10 quasars .",
    "the fourth public data release ( dr4 ) includes photometric data for @xmath39  deg@xmath35 of sky , and catalogs @xmath40 objects @xcite .    largely by coincidence ,",
    "the rass and sdss are extremely well - matched , making sdss an ideal tool for identifying large numbers of @xmath0 sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , if one considers the known range of @xmath41 for common x - ray emitters , even the faintest optical counterparts to typical rass sources are bright enough to be detected in the sdss photometric survey and targeted for sdss spectroscopy . for the typical classes of x - ray emitters , including normal stars , normal galaxies , quasars , and bl lacs , the highest x - ray - to - optical flux ratios have log @xmath42 values of about @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the rass flux limit quoted above , this implies that a faint optical counterpart in each of these categories of typical x - ray counterparts will have @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , respectively , and therefore that sdss will obtain accurate photometry for the vast majority of rass counterparts within its footprint .",
    "( we use the @xcite formula for calculations of log  @xmath42 , and substitute @xmath49 magnitudes for @xmath50 and @xmath50 are not equal , the color - dependent difference between the two is relatively small ( @xmath51 for a typical low - redshift quasar with ( b@xmath14v ) @xmath52 ; * ? ? ?",
    "] ) . furthermore ,",
    "at these magnitudes the sdss spectroscopic survey will frequently obtain good signal - to - noise spectra for targeted suspected counterparts , allowing for confident identifications .",
    "isolated neutron stars , however , are not among the typical classes of x - ray emitters , and have anomalously large log @xmath42 values compared to other x - ray sources due to their optical faintness . of the magnificent seven ,",
    "four have suggested optical counterparts with @xmath50 between @xmath53 and @xmath54 and associated log  @xmath55 values between @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "clearly , an optical counterpart to an ins is unlikely to be found using sdss .",
    "rather , we use sdss to search for rass fields devoid of plausible optical counterparts to the sdss @xmath58 limit . such error circles host x - ray sources with such extreme @xmath59 ratios",
    "that an ins becomes a plausible identification .",
    "we select the rass bsc and fsc objects within the sdss dr4 footprint by querying the dr4 database for a complete list of sdss field positions .",
    "sdss fields are @xmath60 pixels and consist of the frames in the five sdss filters for the same part of the sky .",
    "an sdss field is in some sense the survey s smallest imaging unit , in that all elements of a given field are processed by the photometric pipeline at one time . matching the rass positions with those of the @xmath61 dr4 fields obtained , we find that @xmath62 rass sources are within the area defined by the dr4 fields , which covers @xmath39  deg@xmath35 . since there are roughly three rass sources per deg@xmath35 , this number of x - ray sources in the dr4 footprint is consistent with the number of rass sources expected from a simple surface density argument .",
    "unlike other ins candidate searches ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we do not apply a cut based on the measured x - ray hardness ratios ( hr1 and hr2 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "the magnificent seven have hr1 ratios that range from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , not a strong constraint when the possible range is @xmath43 to @xmath63 .",
    "while the hr2 ratio may provide a better tool with which to identify soft x - ray emitters , the uncertainties associated with the count rates for rass faint x - ray sources make this ratio practically undetermined for many of the sources we consider here .    to find the best isolated neutron star candidate fields , we search the @xmath64 rass sources for those with small x - ray positional uncertainties and select the @xmath65 with quoted positional errors ( @xmath66 ) smaller than @xmath67 ( the median rass positional error for this sample is @xmath68 ) . in identifying counterparts to these sources in sdss and other catalogs ( and thereby eliminating them ) , we generally restrict our search to objects within a disk centered on the rass position and of radius either @xmath69 or @xmath70 times the quoted x - ray positional error .",
    "@xcite provide one empirical distribution of the positional offsets of optical counterparts relative to the quoted bsc positional errors ( see their fig .",
    "8 , compiled from correlations with the tycho catalog ; * ? ? ?",
    "an examination of their most reliable matches indicates that this distribution is not adequately described overall by a two - dimensional gaussian , and that a one - dimensional gaussian may be a better fit at larger multiples of the quoted positional error .",
    "we therefore estimate that among the @xmath71 sources we consider further , fewer than 1 is expected to have a counterpart with a positional offset larger than 4 times the @xmath0 x - ray positional error . for simplicity",
    ", we describe this search radius in the rest of the text as equal to @xmath70 @xmath72 ( for positional error ) , and the associated error circle as the @xmath70 @xmath72 error circle .",
    "previous work suggests that roughly one third of the @xmath65 sources with small positional errors are quasars and that another third are bright stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore match the @xmath71 sources with small positional errors to the most recent sdss catalog of @xmath73 spectroscopically identified rass quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we take @xmath69 as our matching radius , meaning that any x - ray source with a spectroscopically confirmed quasar within an error circle of radius @xmath74 @xmath72 is eliminated from further consideration .",
    "similarly , we use the sdss dr4 photometric catalog to eliminate rass fields with a @xmath75 mag object within @xmath69 .",
    "when querying the dr4 database , we request `` primary '' photometry , which requires that objects have a single entry in the database , that they not be deblended , and that they fall within the survey boundaries ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "the median count rate for our sample of rass sources with small positional errors is @xmath76 counts s@xmath27 , so that @xmath75 objects have log  @xmath77 and are most probably the x - ray source counterparts ( see table  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "both of these cuts are extremely conservative , as they are applied without specific @xmath41 restrictions and extend to a large positional offset for each source .",
    "still , a confirmed quasar , or a bright star or galaxy , even with an atypical @xmath41 and at a large positional offset , might be a more plausible identification than an ins .",
    "roughly half of the @xmath71 originally selected sources with small positional errors remain at the end of this stage of our algorithm .",
    "to reduce the number further , we use the dr4 database to eliminate x - ray error circles with any uv - excess objects .",
    "these are objects satisfying @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the sdss @xmath80 completeness limit @xcite ; for the most part , these are candidate ( photometric ) quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this cut also identifies and removes white dwarfs and cataclysmic variables / x - ray binaries . here",
    "we calculate the separation between each such object and the rass source , and eliminate those fields where a uv - excess object falls within the @xmath70 @xmath72 error circle of the associated x - ray source . finally , because the occasional pathologically bland",
    "quasar ( a few percent of all cases ; * ? ? ? * ) or a quasar in a selected redshift range can have colors consistent with those of normal stars and can not easily be identified using sdss - color cuts , we remove fields with objects that have quasar - like x - ray - to - optical flux ratios ( defined as log  @xmath81 , the typical upper limit for agn given by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) _ regardless of their optical colors_. we eliminate all fields where such an object with @xmath82 ( the @xmath80 completeness limit in that band ) is cataloged within @xmath70 @xmath72 of the x - ray position .",
    "this removes about four - fifths of the remaining sources , leaving us with @xmath83 x - ray sources , about @xmath84 of our initial sample of rass sources with small positional errors @xcite . ] .",
    "we then require , when matching these sources to the sdss catalog , that sdss primary photometry within the @xmath70 @xmath72 error circle be available , thereby eliminating false positives  fields that would otherwise be defined as optically blank at this stage of the algorithm only because there is no reliable sdss photometry for them . over @xmath85 of the @xmath83 fields lack sdss photometry ; this is frequently because of the presence of a saturating star or because the rass source falls on the edge of the dr4 footprint .",
    "the remaining @xmath86 rass sources are then fed to simbad and ned , with which we eliminate @xmath87 .",
    "roughly half of these sources are cataloged clusters within @xmath69 , while the rest include known bl  lacs or bright 2mass galaxies within the @xmath70 @xmath72 error circle .",

    "reveals it to be an emission line galaxy and therefore a conceivable ( though unusual ) x - ray source .",
    "we eliminate these fields and are left with a list of @xmath6 x - ray error circles that are optically blank ( devoid of plausible optical counterparts ) at the sdss catalog level as defined by our algorithm .    visual inspection of the _ rosat _ hard and soft band images of these @xmath6 fields allows us to eliminate nine rass sources from further consideration .",
    "these eliminated sources include possible artifacts and extended or very uncertain x - ray detections . among the rass sources eliminated at this stage",
    "is 1rxs j115309.7@xmath91545636 , one of the sources observed with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ as a candidate ins by @xcite .",
    "their observations confirmed that 1rxs j115309.7@xmath91545636 is in fact not an ins ( see  5.1 ) .",
    "three additional rass sources were set aside at this stage .",
    "their quoted positional error of @xmath92 appears to be an underestimate if one considers the count rates and exposure lengths for these sources ( see appendix for further discussion ) .",
    "some fraction of the remaining x - ray sources are likely to be associated with optically faint clusters of galaxies .",
    "we therefore correlate our remaining x - ray positions with a catalog of optically selected sdss clusters ( j.  annis 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "two of our x - ray sources fall outside of the cluster catalog s footprint , and were therefore not subject to this cluster analysis ; see table  1 .",
    "the optical clusters are described in part by their @xmath93 , the number of red sequence galaxies brighter than @xmath94 within a 1  mpc radius volume , with sdss colors providing a photometric estimate of the redshifts .",
    "if there is a candidate cluster with @xmath95 with an offset @xmath96 from the x - ray position , we eliminate the x - ray source as a candidate ins .",
    "this removes two rass sources from consideration and is consistent with our elimination , earlier in our algorithm , of cases with a cataloged ned / simbad cluster within @xmath69 .    in identifying clusters at larger angular separations as the likely rass x - ray source",

    "we choose @xmath98 as our richness criterion for considering a cluster to be the likely x - ray source , in these high positional offset cases , and thereby eliminate another five rass error circles as candidate clusters ( see appendix for further discussion of these candidate clusters ) .",
