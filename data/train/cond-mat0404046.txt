    "the surface diffusion of single adatoms has been intensively studied over the last decades ,  @xcite due to its importance in thin film and crystal growth .",
    "@xcite once individual atoms are adsorbed on a surface they can meet , thus forming larger clusters .",
    "however , the diffusion of even the simplest cluster , a dimer , on a surface is by far not yet understood .",
    "@xcite the diffusion dynamics can be strongly affected by the coupling of the intramolecular motion to the translational motion of the centre of mass ( cm ) of the cluster .",
    "@xcite herein , we present a simple , one - dimensional model for studying the hamiltonian and diffusive dynamics of a dimer , which is relevant to systems where quasi - one - dimensional motion takes place .",
    "@xcite the deterministic dynamics of this model is characterized by a complex behavior , dominated by non - linear effects , parametric resonances and chaotic features . at variance with the case of a single atom , at @xmath0",
    "the role of the internal degrees of freedom of the dimer is responsible for deviations from activated behavior of the diffusion coefficient . in section  [ sec.model ]",
    "we briefly outline our model . in sections  [ sec.deterministic ] and  [ sec.thermal ]",
    "we discuss the nonlinear deterministic and thermal dynamics , respectively , and compare the two situations in section  [ sec.relation ] .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec.conclusion ] .",
    "we consider the deterministic and thermal dynamics of a dimer moving on a periodic one - dimensional substrate . the particle - substrate interaction is a sinusoidal function of amplitude @xmath1 and period @xmath2 , and the interparticle interaction",
    "is given by a harmonic potential with spring constant @xmath3 and equilibrium length @xmath4 .",
    "we use langevin dynamics to deal with finite temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the equations of motion for the two atoms of mass @xmath6 and of coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 composing the dimer are given by equation  ( [ e.dim ] ) : @xmath9 where the effect of finite temperature @xmath5 is taken into account by the stochastically fluctuating forces @xmath10 , satisfying the conditions @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and by the damping term @xmath13 . in the following , we will use representative values of the parameters , @xmath14 nm , @xmath15 ev , @xmath16 kg , @xmath17 ps@xmath18 . the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 will be given in the caption of each figure .",
    "we performed molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , integrating the equations of motion using a velocity - verlet algorithm , with a time step @xmath19 s and averaging the trajectories over several thousands of realizations in the case of thermal diffusion , in order to reduce the statistical noise .",
    "first we consider the hamiltonian dynamics ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 in equation  ( [ e.dim ] ) ) .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite equation  ( [ e.dim ] ) in terms of the cm coordinate @xmath22 and of the deviations from equilibrium of the internal coordinate @xmath23 , obtaining equation  ( [ e.cm ] ) : @xmath24 \\\\ m\\ddot{x}_r & = & -2kx_r-\\frac{2\\pi u_0}{a } \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi",
    "x_{cm}}{a}\\right ) \\sin\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{a } \\left(x_r+l\\right)\\right ] \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] we have considered the case of a commensurate dimer ( @xmath25 ) starting at equilibrium with a given initial kinetic energy @xmath26 , a case which allows some analytical results for the initial phase of the motion , showing the role of internal vibrations on the dynamics , to be obtained .",
    "@xcite in fact , for a rigid dimer with @xmath27 , the minimum kinetic energy for the cm to overcome the potential barrier is @xmath28 .",
    "hence , for @xmath29 , the motion of the cm is oscillatory , while a drift regime is attained for @xmath30 .",
    "conversely , when the dimer is allowed to vibrate , the coupling between the cm and the internal motion makes it possible for the cm of the dimer to overcome the potential barrier @xmath31 for values of @xmath32 below the threshold @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , if the internal motion is excited , it can happen that one particle remains in the minimum and the other reaches the nearest maximum . from the energy balance ,",
    "equation  ( [ e.energybal ] ) follows : @xmath34 if @xmath3 is sufficiently small , the right - hand side of equation  ( [ e.energybal ] ) can be smaller than @xmath31 .",
    "this is the situation shown in figure  [ f.dimerdetu_00.6k0.1eta0l1 ] , where the cm motion is rather irregular , behaving in a chaotic fashion .",
    "this chaotic regime occurs for weakly bound dimers in a velocity window around the threshold @xmath35 , and can be characterized by lyapunov exponents and power spectra .",
    "@xcite we have also shown that , for larger values of @xmath3 , the drift motion of the cm may excite the internal vibrations by a parametric resonance in a velocity window around twice the natural stretching frequency of the dimer @xmath36 .",
    "the thermal diffusive behavior of the dimer is characterized by computing the diffusion coefficient @xmath37 from the mean square displacement @xmath38 , as in equation  ( [ e.diffcoeff ] ) : @xmath39 for temperatures that are small compared to the energy barrier , kramer s theory  @xcite predicts an activated arrhenius behavior of diffusion , given by equation  ( [ e.arrhenius ] ) : @xmath40 where the activation energy @xmath41 and the prefactor @xmath42 do not depend on @xmath5 . in the limit of vanishing energy barrier ,",
    "the adatom diffusion coefficient obeys the einstein relation and is given by @xmath43 , twice the value of the dimer @xmath44 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of a single adatom shown in figure  [ f.diffusmon-l0.5-l1-inc ] has an activation energy corresponding to the energy barrier @xmath45  ev , except at very high temperatures owing to finite barrier effects .",
    "@xcite    for a rigid dimer , @xmath46 for @xmath25 down to @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "if the dimer is not rigid , the activation energy is a non trivial function of the equilibrium length and elastic constant . in figure",
    "[ f.diffusmon-l0.5-l1-inc ] , we show the diffusion coefficient for non rigid dimers with different values of @xmath4 .",
    "we find @xmath49  ev for @xmath25 , @xmath50 ev for @xmath48 and @xmath51  ev for the incommensurate case @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the golden mean .",
    "the finite - barrier corrections to the arrhenius behavior at high temperatures ( @xmath54 ) are rather pronounced for @xmath55 .",
    "deviations from the arrhenius law due to incommensurability are also found for larger clusters .",
    "@xcite    it has been suggested that non - arrhenius behavior can result also from dynamical effects related to the internal motion of the dimer .",
    "@xcite the role of the internal vibrations on the diffusive behavior is illustrated in figure  [ f.diffusinc](a ) , where we compare the diffusion coefficient of the rigid and non rigid incommensurate dimer ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "it is clear that we can define a unique value of @xmath41 for the rigid dimer , whereas the activation energy is , in general , temperature dependent when the dimer is allowed to vibrate .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath41 is linked to a temperature dependent misfit @xmath57 , induced by the dynamics , as shown in figure  [ f.diffusinc](b ) .",
    "moreover , the dimer can even diffuse faster than the adatom , at least for @xmath58 and low temperatures .",
    "enhanced diffusivity of dimers and small clusters is also found by theoretical studies of @xmath59 diffusion in molecular sieves  @xcite and in zeolite crystals .",
    "@xcite mitsui et al .",
    "@xcite measured water diffusion on pd(111 ) at low temperature ( @xmath60 k ) , finding the mobility of dimers and larger clusters to be @xmath61 orders of magnitude larger than that of adatoms .",
    "this experimental result is compatible with our findings .",
    "in fact , extrapolation to low temperature of our results of figure  [ f.diffusmon-l0.5-l1-inc ] shows that the dimer diffusion for @xmath55 can be orders of magnitude higher than for the adatom",
    "we find that the chaotic dynamics discussed in section  [ sec.deterministic ] can give rise to a diffusive behavior , even in the absence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "the role of the heat bath is played by the exchange between translational and internal motion which , owing to the nonlinearity of the system , can occur in a random manner .",
    "figure  [ f.x2 ] shows a comparison between the deterministic and the thermal mean square displacements .    in the deterministic case",
    "@xmath62 represents a time averaging taken by displacing the time origin ,  @xcite whereas at @xmath0 it is an average over realizations .",
    "the long - time behavior is linear ( diffusive ) even for the hamiltonian dynamics in the chaotic regime . in both cases",
    "we also find a transient superdiffusive regime ( @xmath63 , with @xmath64 ) .",
    "anomalous diffusion with @xmath65 has also been observed in a model of adatom surface diffusion in two dimensions .",
    "@xcite anomalous diffusion might be related to long jumps of the dimer , that is to trajectories that move over multiple surface minima ,  @xcite which do occur during our simulations .",
    "furthermore , it has been claimed that a deterministic diffusive behavior leads to a non - arrhenius dependence of the thermal diffusion coefficient ,  @xcite which is compatible with our results .",
    "we have presented a one - dimensional model to describe the diffusive dynamics of dimers on periodic surfaces .",
    "we have shown that the coupling between translational and vibrational degrees of freedom can lead to hamiltonian chaotic motion and to non - arrhenius behavior of thermal diffusion .",
    "we have also pointed out the relation between deterministic and thermal diffusion .",
    "it would be interesting to enhance the complexity of the system by considering orientational degrees of freedom in two dimensions and anharmonic intramolecular potentials .",
