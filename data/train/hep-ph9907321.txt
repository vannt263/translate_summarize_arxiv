    "the chiral quark model ( chqm ) and its extensions@xcite-@xcite have attracted much interest continually during the last two decades . the reasons why the chqm is so attractive are both because of its elegant descriptions of the features of low - energy qcd and because of its great successes in the different aspects of phenomenological predictions on hadron physics ( see the brief review on chqm in section 2 of this paper ) .",
    "however , so far , the studies on chqm face two challenges as soon as we start going beyond lowest order : 1 ) how to go beyond the chiral perturbative theory(chpt ) ? in order to capture physics between perturbative qcd and chpt@xcite-@xcite , freedoms of meson resonances have to be included into dynamics .",
    "it was well known that , in this energy region , there are no well - defined method to yield a convergence expansion .",
    "therefore , we need some phenomenological models including spin-1 meson resonances as well pseudoscalar meson to describe the physics in this energy region . although there are some discussion@xcite , role of mesons resonances in chqm are still uncertain .",
    "2 ) how to go beyond large @xmath4 limit ? the chqm - studies are limited to be on the level to catch merely the leading order effects of large @xmath4 expansion .",
    "in other words , like other qcd - inspired models ( e.g. , bag model , skyrme model , pole model and so on ) , only the leading order evaluations in chqm are legitimate and practicable , and there is no way to calculate the next to leading order contributions in the model so far , even though there are some arguments on suppression of @xmath2 in chqm .",
    "this is a bad shortage .",
    "it makes the calculations of chqm uncontrolled approximations , in that there is no well - defined way to put error bars on the predictions . in this sense",
    ", any conclusions coming from chqm would become uncertain . in order to improve this unhappy situation of chqm ,",
    "it is necessary and urgent to study contributions beyond the leading order in chqm . with these motivation , in this paper ,",
    "we first extend chqm to include spin-1 meson resonances .",
    "then we like to provide a systematical study to illustrate the chqm - calculations to be legitimate up to the next to leading order of @xmath2 expansion .",
    "the simplest version of chqm which was originated by weinberg@xcite , and developed by manohar and georgi@xcite provides a qcd - inspired description on the simple constituent quark model(m - g model ) . in view of this model , in the energy region between the chiral symmetry - breaking scale ( @xmath5 ) and the confinement scale ( @xmath6 ) , the dynamical field degrees of freedom are constituent quarks(quasi - particle of quarks ) , gluons and goldstone bosons associated with chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking(cssb ) . in this quasiparticle description ,",
    "the effective coupling between gluon and quarks is small and the important interaction is the coupling between quarks and goldstone bosons .",
    "fields of pseudoscalar mesons in m - g model are treated as composite fields of quarks and anti - quarks instead of independent dynamical freedoms .",
    "dynamics of pseudoscalar mesons is described by an effective lagrangian , which is derived via integrating out the quark fields(``freeze '' the quark - freedom ) .",
    "there are no meson resonances in orginal m - g model . from viewpoint of chiral symmetry ,",
    "role of the lowest meson resonances in low energy effective theories has been analyzed systematically in ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors illustrate that all meson resonance fields can be treated on same level : they carry non - linear realizations of chiral @xmath7 which are uniquely determined by the known transformation properties under the vectorial subgroup @xmath8(octets and singlet ) .",
    "this is an attractive symmetry property on meson resonances and shall be adopted in this present paper .",
    "of course , it is not necessary to describe the degrees of freedom of vector and axial - vector mesons by antisymmetric tensor fields@xcite , and there are other phenomenological successful attempts to introduce spin-1 meson resonances as massive yang - mills fields@xcite . in addition , it was well known that vector meson dominant(vmd ) is a very important phenomenological feature in electro - weak interaction of hadrons . in chqm",
    ", it is nature to introduce spin-1 meson resonances via vmd and is especially convenient to describe relevant degrees of freedom in terms of familiar vector representation(see section 2 ) .",
    "similar to m - g model , all freedoms of meson resonances in chqm are treated as composite fields of quark pairs , effective lagrangian describing dynamics of mesons is derived via effects of quark loops .    according to large @xmath4 arguement@xcite",
    ", the color coupling between quarks and gluon fields also yields the leading order contribution at large @xmath4 limit .",
    "however , this contribution was omitted in orginal m - g model and its many extensions .",
    "this problem has been first noticed in ref.@xcite , in that reference the authors investigated the effects of leading gluon coupling(@xmath9 ) in m - g model .",
    "since it is unknown how to perform analytically the remaining integration over the gluon fields and this coupling become rather unclear in presence of meson composite fields , the authors suggested a possible way , which is to parameterize phenomenologically this effective coupling and make a weak gluon - field expansion around the resulting physical vacuum . in this present paper , in order to carry out a complete study on @xmath2 expansion at leading order , the investigation in ref.@xcite will be extended to include pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector mesons . in ref.@xcite , the authors showed that the gluon coupling contributes to low energy coupling constants @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 but does not contribute to other coupling constants of chpt at @xmath14 . in particuar , the correction due to gluon coupling contributes to @xmath10 and @xmath13 is about @xmath15 .",
    "it makes @xmath10 agree with experiment data .",
    "this is an important improvment so that the quark - gluon coupling in chqm can not be omitted simply . from these results",
    ", it seems to be little fortunate ingredients in phenomenological success of those chiral quark model without the gluon coupling .",
    "however , in this paper we will show that , in case of presence of spin-1 meson resonances , the contribution of the gluon coupling is suppressed due to mixing between axial - vector and pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the results are that gluon coupling corrects to @xmath13 about @xmath16 and to @xmath10 about @xmath17 only .",
    "simultaneously , @xmath10 and @xmath13 are compensated by effect of exchange of spin-1 meson resonances and , hence , they agree with data well . therefore , the gluon correction in presence of meson resonances is much smaller than one obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , it becomes legitimate to treat quark - gluon coupling as perturbation in the present model .",
    "chqm is a non - renormalizable effective field theory , since there are too few free parameters to introduce enough counterterms to absorb divergences from quark - loop and meson - loop integral .",
    "therefore , we have to parameterize the divergences from quark loops as well as meson loops , i.e. , we need to introduce cut - offs for regularizing these divergences .",
    "we first discuss the divergences from quark loops . from viewpoint of qcd ,",
    "these divergences are caused by `` point particle '' approximation of mesons .",
    "hence the cut - offs to regularize these divergences can be treated as description on scale of interaction of quark pairs in mesons . in this paper , corresponding to spin zero and one , two cut - offs are needed to describe internal interaction scale of @xmath18 and @xmath19 mesons .",
    "it is well known that , at very low energy , there should be a cut - off which correspond to energy scale of chiral symmetry spontaneous broken , @xmath20 . in presence of spin-1 mesons , another cut - off should be introduced with energy increasing .",
    "unfortunately , there are not any practical methods helping us to understand properties of this cut - off from qcd .",
    "it is only expected that , due to requirement of consistence , this cut - off should be larger than @xmath20 and all spin-1 meson masses . in sect .",
    "3 , we will fit values of these two cut - offs phenomenologically and show that they are consistent indeed .    as soon as we start studying the next to leading order of @xmath2 expansion , there are two contributions contained the same as at leading order .",
    "one contribution is from meson loops and another contribution is from quark - gluon coupling .",
    "it has to be recognized that it is too hard to systematically study quark - gluon coupling at the next to leading order of @xmath2 expansion .",
    "the reason is that we will face many uncertain ingredients and very tedious calculation .",
    "in fact , even though at leaing order of @xmath2 expansion , it is impossible to completely investigate the contribution from quark - gluon coupling , since theoretically , the numbers of these kinds of feynman diagrams are infinite(see detail in sect .",
    "fortunately , the dominant contribution can be captured here .",
    "the phenomenological results show that the quark - gluon coupling is small even at leading order .",
    "we can expect that it is legitimate to ignore the next to leading order contribution of quark - gluon coupling .",
    "expansion and ozi rule . ] due to these reasons , the effects of quark - gluon coupling will be omitted at the next to leading order of @xmath2 .",
    "the main content of the present paper is to study effects of one - loop of pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector mesons systematically .",
    "obviously , the calculation on meson one - loop effects is beyond one of chpt in which only pseudoscalar meson one - loop graphs are involved . so that it will help us to understand the dynamics with energy scale lying between perturbative qcd and chpt more accurately",
    "especially , many processes suppressed by @xmath2 will become calculable explicitly .",
    "however , although in principle there are no problems on calculation of meson one - loop graphs , practical calculation is very tedious due to complicated dynamics structure of effective lagrangian and due to various high - order divergences coming from propagators of spin-1 mesons(see sect . 6 ) .",
    "hence we need to search a method to simplify our calculation .",
    "noting that we work in the framework of a non - renormalizable truncated field theory , we have to introduce some cut - offs to regularize divergences from meson loops .",
    "these cut - offs can be interpreted as meson - interaction scale in the `` effective vertices '' generated by meson loops .",
    "therefore , the effects of meson loops describe `` very long - distance '' correction comparing with one of quark loops .",
    "contribution of the former should be much smaller than the latter . in the other word",
    ", the cut - offs from meson loops should be much smaller than one from quark loops , e.g. , @xmath20 .",
    "it indicates that momentum transfer in meson loops is small .",
    "if these cut - offs is smaller than vector meson masses , the dominant contributions will come from logarithmic divergences and all high order divergences can be omitted .",
    "sequentially , the complicated calculation will be simplified . in sect .",
    "6 , this point will be examined explicitly .",
    "although we still do not know how to obtain a low energy effective theory from qcd directly , relationship between chqm and chpt is straightforward . at very low energy , when the freedoms of spin-1 mesons are `` freezed''(i.e . , integrating out these freedoms by path - integral ) , chqm should return to chpt .",
    "it is well known that chpt is a rigorous consequence of the symmetry pattern in qcd and its spontaneous breaking . so that it is necessary to examine low energy limit of chqm and check whether it agrees with chpt or not . in this article",
    ", we will calculate ten coupling constants of chpt at @xmath14 from chqm and show that they agree with chpt well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we give a brief review on chqm and extend chqm to include spin-1 meson resonances . in sect .",
    "3 , we derive effective lagrangian of mesons generated by quark loops . in sect .",
    "4 , the correction of quark - gluon coupling is studied .",
    "we further compare chqm and qcd sum rules and determine the value of gluon condensate obtained through integrating over quark and gluon fields .",
    "general formulas for meson one - loop contribution are in sect . 5 and systematical study on meson one - loop graphs is in sect .",
    "6 . in sect 7",
    ", we discuss low energy limit of chqm and some phenomenological results .",
    "8 is devoted to summary and discussion .",

    "(  [ 7.3.7 ] ) into eq .",
    "(  [ 7.3.3 ] ) and using the mass    relation (  [ 7.3.8 ] ) and eq .",
    "(  [ 3.2.4 ] ) we can prove the first weinberg    sum rule is satisfied in chqm .",
    "it is not surprising since the first    weinberg sum rule is derived from chiral symmetry , pcac and vmd , and    the present theory is just a realization of chiral symmetry , pcac and    vmd .",
    "it was well known that , in very low energy , chpt is a rigorous consequence of the symmetry pattern in qcd and its spontaneous breaking .",
    "effective lagrangian of chpt depends on a number of low - energy coupling constants which can not be determined from the symmetries of the fundamental theory only .",
    "as soon as we start going beyond the lowest order , the number of free parameters increases very rapidly , it makes calculation beyond the lowest few order rather impractical .",
    "in addition , at energy lying scale between perturbative qcd and chpt , there is no well - defined method to yield a explicitly convergence expansion .",
    "therefore , instead of chpt , some phenomenological models are needed to capture the physics between perturbative qcd and chpt .",
    "chqm is just the one of such models with fewer free parameters . since the low energy coupling constants , @xmath578 , yielded by fewer parameters in chqm agree with chpt , it reflects dynamics constraint of these low energy constants .    in chqm ,",
    "the dynamics of composite meson fields are generated by the quark loops .",
    "of course , it is better if we can start with a lagrangian which is purely fermionic and hadronic fields are generated by the model itself .",
    "however , it is rather impractical since we know nothing about how quarks and anti - quarks are bounded into hadrons .",
    "furthermore , the most ambitious attempts are to find a chirally symmetric solution to the schwinger - dyson equations@xcite .",
    "these methods are typically plagued by instabilities in the solution of the equation .",
    "so that the composite meson fields still have to be added explicitly by hand in this paper .",
    "we have presented in this article a systematic treatment of all spin-1 meson resonances @xmath71 and @xmath72 in framework of chqm .",
    "all possible chiral couplings between spin-1 meson resonances and pseudoscalar fields were derived up to lowest order in the chiral expansion and the next to leading order of @xmath2 expansion .",
    "therefore , it become possible to study low energy physics of mesons in a unified model with finite number of free parameters .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath579 mixing play a crucial role in the model .",
    "this mixing is the energy transition caused by quark loops instead of input from symmetry . because the gap between @xmath580 and @xmath581 is not very large(@xmath582 ) ,",
    "the constant @xmath583 defined in the field shift (  [ 3.1.12 ] ) play a significant role .",
    "it means that it can not be consistent if we introduce only vector meson resonances but without their chiral partners in chqm .    through using method of svz sum rules in framework of chqm",
    ", it was shown that chqm is indeed a phenomenologically successful model at low energy .",
    "it is rather difficult to analytically determine the relation between chqm and various vacuum condensates in svz sum rules .",
    "however , it can be found that the following basic idea of chqm is surprisingly similar to one of svz sum rules .",
    "1)the mesonic dynamics in chqm is generated by quark loops(and gluon loops when quark - gluon coupling is included ) .",
    "correspondingly , in svz sum rules , the hadronic properties are studied through parameterizing the effects caused by the vacuum fields . here , the effects of quark loops in chqm correspond to various fermion condensate of svz sum rules , and the effects of gluon loops in chqm correspond to various gluon condensate of svz sum rules .",
    "2 ) physically , for avoiding double counting , we require that the gluon fields must be _ soft _ so that exchange effects of gluons between quark fields do not creat bound states . the similar conclusion is obtained in svz sum rules clearly@xcite , that `` _ only soft(low frequency ) modes are to be retained in the ( gluon ) condensates_''@xcite . a result is yielded directly from the above conclusion , that contribution from the triple gluon condensate @xmath584 is smaller than one from triple gluon terms in quadratic gluon condenstate @xmath585 .",
    "the reason is that momentum power counting of the former is higher than one of the latter .",
    "this result also coincides with phenomenological analysis previously .",
    "we have shown how to systematically calculate meson one - loop graphs in chqm . as well as our expectation ,",
    "the contributions from soft gluon coupling and meson one - loop effects are both smaller than one from quark loops . we must point out that , instead of @xmath2 suppression , the contribution from meson loops are suppressed by `` very long - distance '' property of meson interaction in meson loops(or scale property ) .",
    "theoretically , the large @xmath4 expansion is still an attractive argument@xcite .",
    "however , since in practical we only take @xmath204 instead of @xmath586 , the next to leading order contribution is not suppressed intensively by @xmath2 expansion . especially , many contributions from meson one - loop are proportional to flavor number @xmath461 , so that in fact they do not receive any suppression from a theoretically well - defined expansion .",
    "we have to be aware that it is a difficulty how the large @xmath4 argument is applied in case of @xmath204 for the real world .    there are some conclusions for meson one - loop correction .",
    "1 ) it is a important feature on meson loops that the square of momentum transfer in meson loops is very small .",
    "this feature indicates that the contributions from the `` low - frequency '' of quantum meson fields are dominant .",
    "it is common conclusion of low energy theory .",
    "2 ) although the contribution from meson loops is small , many nontrivial results are yielded .",
    "for example , @xmath587 , @xmath588 and some processes forbidden by ozi rules do not vanish here(further studies on ozi forbidden processes will be done elsewhere ) .",
    "3 ) due to large mass gap between pseudoscalar and spin-1 mesons , contribution from one - loop graphs of @xmath18 mesons is much larger than the one from one - loops of @xmath19 mesons .",
    "4 ) the calculation on meson one - loop is formal in this paper .",
    "there are still some problems that need to further study , e.g. , imaginary part of @xmath589 matrix element appears only via direct calculation on relevant feynman diagrams .",
    "it is important to examine unitary of @xmath589 matrix element and will be found in other papers .",
