    "the final fatal scene of a massive ( @xmath0  8  @xmath5 ) star is a sudden collapse of its fe core and a subsequent appearance of a supernova ( sn ) .",
    "the study of the core - collapse sne has been one of the centerpieces of the modern astrophysics , accompanying various fundamental physics aided by the state - of - art numerical simulations and dedicated observations .",
    "although how the core - collapse sne explode still needs to be understood despite extensive studies of the past and present , one unequivocal prediction is the formation of fe ejecta as the final product of the nucleosynthesis deep inside a progenitor .",
    "since the formation and expulsion of the fe is very sensitive to the sn explosion details , the dynamics and chemistry of the fe ejecta in young core - collapse sn remnants ( snrs ) can in principle provide critical information to understanding the core - collapse sn explosion . however , fe ejecta in snrs are elusive , with very limited detections to date concentrated on hot diffuse x - ray ejecta . in the optical waveband , which is sensitive to dense , cold ejecta ,",
    "all the observed ejecta are dominated by the o , n , si , or s with little contribution from the fe .",
    "so far dense fe - rich ejecta have never been detected as far as we are aware , and we report here the first such case in g11.20.3 .    g11.20.3  is a young snr thought to be the remains of the historical sn of ad  386 @xcite .",
    "it has a shell of 2@xmath6 radius at 5  kpc distance @xcite , bright both in the radio and x - rays , along with a central pulsar and its elongated wind nebula @xcite .",
    "g11.20.3  was proposed to be an evolved version of the cassiopeia  a ( cas  a ) snr because of their similar radio shells @xcite , and both may be a sn  iil / b with a red supergiant progenitor @xcite .",
    "recently we discovered bright near - infrared ( ir ) [ ]  emission from the fe ejecta in g11.20.3  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the [ ]  emission concentrates on two opposite filaments at its northwestern ( nw ) and southeastern ( se ) boundaries , while numerous smaller clumpy knots scattered across the snr .",
    "our high - resolution spectroscopic observations of the [ ]  emission presented here reveal clear velocity differences among the fe ejecta as well as its chemical composition , providing information for understanding the nature of the ejecta in connection with the core - collapse sn explosion in g11.20.3 .",
    "we performed near - ir [ ]  line spectroscopic observations of the snr g11.20.3  in 2006 june 69 using the long - slit near - infrared spectrograph @xcite of the palomar 5-m hale telescope .",
    "the long - slit spectrograph is equipped with a nicmos 256 @xmath7 256 pixels hgcdte detector , and the slit length and width were 38  and 1 , respectively .",
    "we first obtained high - resolution ( @xmath8 @xmath0 4000 ) spectra of the [ ]  1.644 @xmath9 m line from five bright fe knots ( which we name knots a ",
    "e ) around the central pulsar and the nw and se filaments , measuring their radial velocities ( fig .  [ fig_overall ] ) .",
    "we then observed the knots and filaments with the low - resolution ( @xmath8 @xmath10 700 ) mode to detect both [ ]  1.644 and 1.599 @xmath9 m lines simultaneously and used their line intensities to calculate the electron number densities ( see below ) .",
    "we also observed he  i ( 1.083 @xmath9 m ) and [ ]  ( 1.0291.037 @xmath9 m ) lines from the knots and filaments , but detected only the he  i line emission from the se filament .",
    "all the knots and filaments were observed at least twice dithered along the slit , and the sky emission , including the oh sky lines , was subtracted using the dithered frame .",
    "in addition , we observed the knot  a with the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ; * ? ? ? * ) of the 8-m subaru telescope on 2006 july 25 .",
    "we obtained a spectrum covering almost the entire near - ir atmospheric windows of @xmath11 bands in the range of 1.032.49 @xmath9 m  using the echelle mode with two aladdin iii @xmath12 insb arrays .",
    "the slit width of ircs was @xmath13 which corresponds to the spectral resolution @xmath8 @xmath10 5,000 .",

    "the contours in the main left panel represent the vla radio image @xcite . in the right panel ,",
    "the thick solid contour delineates the boundary of the strong chandra x - ray emission of the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) elongated in the northeastern ( ne ) and southwestern ( sw ) direction , while the red dashed contour represents the boundary of the pwn from radio tomography @xcite .",
    "the ejecta knots are projected to be within or close to the radio boundary of the pwn . the [ ]",
    "spectra exhibit clear velocity differences among the knots and filaments : a , b in the east are blueshifted by @xmath0 1,000 @xmath3 ; c ,  d ,  e  in the west have relatively small blueshifts of @xmath14  60  @xmath3",

    "se direction of the two filaments is almost perpendicular to the ne  sw elongation direction of the x - ray pwn .",
    "we note that in the spectra of the knots c and d there appear to be weak emission components around 1,000 @xmath3 , which are mainly caused by the imperfect sky subtraction of the oh sky line at 1.6389 @xmath9 m .",
    "the imperfect sky subtraction is also responsible for the negative dips adjacent to the emission components in the spectra .",
    "however , for the knot c , in addition to the contribution from the imperfect sky subtraction , we find that there might be additional emission from the source itself around 1,000 @xmath3 , although the intensity is too faint to be confirmed .",
    "similarly the weak emission component in the knot b around 0 @xmath3  is also caused by the imperfect sky subtraction of the oh sky line at 1.6442 @xmath9 m .",

    "the spectrum is somewhat noisy at @xmath14  1.1  @xmath9 m , but appears to be devoid of the s ( [ ]  @xmath10 1.2901.037  @xmath9 m and [ ]  @xmath10 1.082  @xmath9 m ) and o ( o  i @xmath10 1.129  @xmath9 m ) lines which are much brighter than the fe lines in the o - rich sn ejecta of cas  a @xcite .",
    "the upper limits , at the 90  % confidence level , of the line intensities of these lines are approximately 0.17 ( [ ]  lines ) , 0.15 ( [ ]  line ) , and 0.47 ( o  i lines ) times of that of the [ ]  line at 1.257 @xmath9 m . if the cas  a ejecta suffered the same extinction @xmath16 @xmath10 13 of g11.20.3 , the [ ]  lines would be @xmath17 10 times brighter than the [ ]  line at 1.257  @xmath9 m , while the [ ]  and o  i lines would be roughly as bright as the [ ]  line , indicating that the dense [ ]  knots in g11.20.3  are different from the o - rich ejecta found in other snrs such as cas  a. the absence of he  i line ( 1.083 @xmath9 m ) in the spectrum of the knot  a is also consistent with its ejecta origin , not the circumstellar origin .",

    "we also corrected for the extinction effect of @xmath16 = 13  mag and assumed the electron temperature to be 5,000  k. the observed (= reddened ) fluxes of the 1.644  @xmath9 m line emission of the five ejecta knots ( a  e ) are in the range of ( 3.89.0 ) @xmath7 10@xmath20 ergs sec@xmath21 @xmath22 , which , together with the above electron number density of the knot  a , corresponds to the mass of the ejecta knots in the range of ( 0.81.8 )  @xmath7 10@xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "the [ ]  emission in g11.20.3  primarily consists of two bipolar filaments in the nw and se boundaries and clumpy internal knots scattered across the snr . in paper",
    "i we proposed an interpretation that the internal knots and the nw filament are fe ejecta from the sn explosion , while the se filament has contributions from both the fe ejecta and swept - up circumstellar material ( csm ) .",
    "our results here reaffirm the previous interpretation and also provide new information as follows .",
    "first , the large ( @xmath0  1,000 @xmath3 ) blueshifts of the two eastern knots ( a ,  b ) evince that they are indeed fe ejecta produced in the sn explosion .",
    "their radial velocities are roughly comparable to those of the sn ejecta knots in other young snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while they move much faster than shocked csm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of strong emission from any elements other than fe is consistent with the interpretation of the sn ejecta origin of a ,  b  as well .",
    "the ejecta nature of a ,  b  then asserts that other fe knots are sn ejecta , including c ,  d ,  e  in the west . for the nw and se filaments ,",
    "the former shows the large redshift of @xmath0 200  @xmath3 , which , together with its knotty emission feature along the inner boundary of the snr shell , supports the interpretation that it is an aggregate of fe sn ejecta knots .",
    "the absence of any significant doppler shift in the se filament , on the other hand , confirms its location at the tangential boundary of g11.20.3 , and the detection of the he  i ( 1.083 @xmath9 m ) line emission ( see   2 ) manifests the existence of the swept - up csm in the se filament in addition to the fe ejecta .",
    "the most conspicuous feature in the radial velocity distribution of the fe ejecta in g11.20.3  is the large ( @xmath0  1,000  @xmath3 ) differences between the eastern ( a ,  b ) and western ( c ,  d ,  e ) knots which are projected to be close to the center .",
    "obviously the large blueshifts of a ,  b are quite notable ; however , the small doppler shifts of c ,  d ,  e  are also rather unexpected , given that even the nw filament near the snr boundary shows more substantial radial velocities .",
    "we briefly consider two possibilities as the origin of the velocity distribution of the knots .",
    "first , the small doppler shifts of c ,  d ,  e  can be explained if they have been significantly decelerated compared to a ,  b  since the sn explosion .",
    "the circumstellar material from the progenitor or material from the outer envelop of the sn can in principle be responsible for the deceleration . secondly ,",
    "if there is a systematic velocity shift of @xmath17  500  @xmath3   between the eastern and western knots , their velocity discrepancy can be explained as a ,  b  move towards us while c ,  d ,  e  move away from us .",
    "such a systematic velocity of the sn ejecta is not rare and has been reported in several other young snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . or , for the case of g11.20.3 ,",
    "if the central ejecta have been swept up by the central pwn , the latter may produce such a systematic velocity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the bow - shock like p - v diagram of the knot a can be explained by this scenario : if the knot a has moved towards us , the ram pressure - conserving reverse shock of the snr can produce such a bow shock feature .",
    "no other lines are identified from the fe ejecta in g11.20.3   than the he  i line from the se filament .",
    "this supports the interpretation that the se filament , in contrast to the other knots and filament , has contributions from both the sn ejecta and shocked csm ( paper  i ) .",
    "while the detection of the he  i line supports for the existence of the csm , the increased abundances in the best - fit spectrum of the chandra x - ray data @xcite may reaffirm the existence of the ejecta in the se filament , although the x - ray spectrum appears to be inadeqaute for thorough abundance analyses . on the other hand ,",
    "the absence of s ( both s  i and s@xmath15 ) and o  i in our subaru spectrum suggests that the fe ejecta in g11.20.3  can be much different from those found in o - rich snr cas  a (   2 ) in their chemical compositions and/or ionization states .",
    "given the ionization potentials of fe  i ( 7.90 ev ) , fe@xmath15 ( 16.18 ev ) , s@xmath25 ( 23.33 ev ) , and o  i ( 13.62 ev ) , it is highly unlikely that s is in s@xmath26 while fe is in fe@xmath15 , although some o could in principle be o@xmath15 .",
    "the absence of s indicates that the fe ejecta in g11.20.3  may have little contribution from other heavy elements of the sn nucleosysnthesis , suggesting that at least part of fe ejecta in core - collapse sn explosion can be produced without intense microscopic material mixing .",
    "one way to produce such fe ejecta in the explosive nucleosynthesis of the core - collapse sne can be the @xmath4-rich freezeout  process where the high temperature and relatively low density of the shocked innermost layers of a sn exclusively produce the fe @xcite .",
    "therefore , the fe ejecta in g11.20.3  may represent the end product of the explosive sn nucleosynthesis via the @xmath4-rich freezeout  process at the progenitor s core which were expelled outside without significant material mixing .",
    "the prominent mode of the distribution of the dense fe ejecta in g11.20.3   is the bipolar pattern along the nw ",
    "se direction of the two filaments .",
    "this direction is almost perpendicular to the ne  sw elongation direction of the x - ray pwn ( fig .",
    "[ fig_overall ] ) , and the latter direction most likely represents either the rotational (= polar ) or equatorial axis of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the core - collapse sn explosion is mostly asymmetric with major explosion along the progenitor s rotational axis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which predicts the fe ejecta from the core to mainly distribute in a bipolar pattern along the rotational axis .",
    "therefore , it may be the case that the nw ",
    "se direction of the fe ejecta represents the progenitor s rotational axis along which the sn primarily exploded .",
    "if so , the ne  sw elongation of the x - ray pwn may correspond to equatorial flows from the pulsar as observed around the crab pulsar @xcite .",
    "the collimation angles of the nw and se filaments are somewhat large ( @xmath17  60@xmath27 ) ; however , this is consistent with some predictions of core - collapse sn explosions induced by neutrino heating or even magneto - hydrodynamics jets .",
    "for the latter case , it is required that the progenitor is possessed of normal ( or weak ) magnetic field and slow rotation to have large collimation angles , which agrees with the inferred magnetic field ( @xmath17 1.7  @xmath7  10@xmath28  g ) and observed rotational period ( @xmath17 65 ms ) of the central pulsar of g11.20.3  @xcite .",
