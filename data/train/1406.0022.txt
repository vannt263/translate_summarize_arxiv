    "since the advent of the digital signal processing era and of analog - to - digital converters , an intense field of research has been concerned by the non - linear sensing model @xmath13 \\in { \\mathcal}j,\\ ] ] where  @xmath14 is a matrix representing a linear transformation of a signal  @xmath15 taken in some bounded subset @xmath16 of  @xmath1 , and  @xmath17 stands for a quantization of  @xmath18 that maps  @xmath19 to a finite set of vectors  @xmath20 , _",
    "e.g. _ , encoded over a given number of bits @xcite .",
    "the bounded space  @xmath16 containing generally an infinite number of signals , the model   is of course lossy and  @xmath15 can not be recovered exactly from  @xmath21 . quantifying this loss of information as a function of both the signal reconstruction method and of the key elements  @xmath22 ,  @xmath23 ,  @xmath2 ,  @xmath16 and  @xmath17",
    "has been therefore the topic of many studies at the frontier of information theory , high - dimensional geometry , signal processing and statistics .",
    "the general model   is for instance the one adopted in quantized compressed sensing ( qcs ) @xcite , where the signal  @xmath15 is assumed sparse or compressible in an orthonormal basis  @xmath24 of  @xmath25 , and the sensing matrix is generated randomly , _",
    "e.g. _ , from gaussian random ensembles  @xcite . when  @xmath26 , eq",
    ".   is also a model for _ frame coefficient quantization _ ( fcq ) of signals in  @xmath1 , _ i.e. _ , when the coefficients  @xmath27 of  @xmath15 in an overcomplete frame of @xmath1 are quantized in  @xmath28 ,  @xmath29 representing the matrix whose row set  @xmath30 collects the frame vectors  @xcite .    in this work , we restrict the analysis of   to a scalar , regular and uniform quantizer .",
    "the quantization  @xmath17 is then a scalar operation applied componentwise on vectors ; its 1-d quantization cells  @xmath31 = \\{\\lambda : { \\mathcal}q[\\lambda ] = c\\}\\subset { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] are convex and have all the same size ( or _ resolution _ )",
    "other quantization procedures have been studied for   and we refer the reader for instance to  @xcite for a review of scalar and  @xmath33-quantization @xcite in the qcs literature , to  @xcite for a theoretical analysis of non - regular scalar quantizers , to  @xcite for the use of non - regular _ binned _ quantization , or to @xcite for an example of vector quantization by frame permutation . as realized in @xcite , we also assume that the `` variability '' of the components of  @xmath18 , also measured by their variance , does not change with  @xmath2 .",
    "this is critical for defining a quantizer  @xmath17 of constant resolution when  @xmath2 increases .",
    "many studies have addressed the model   by observing that the distortion induced by quantization compared to a linear model  @xmath34 is the one of an additive measurement noise  @xmath35 - { \\boldsymbol}a{\\boldsymbol}x$ ] with  @xmath36 $ ] , _ i.e. _ , @xmath37 when the resolution is small compared to the standard deviation of each component of  @xmath18 , _",
    "i.e. _ , under the _ high resolution assumption _ @xcite , or if a random _ dithering _ is added prior to quantization  @xcite , each component of the noise can be assumed as uniformly distributed within  @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "this allows one to bound the power of this noise , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath39 and  @xmath40 with high probability for  @xmath41 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .    in the case of qcs ,",
    "when a general noise  @xmath42 of bounded power  @xmath43 corrupts the compressive observation of a sparse signal  @xmath15 as in  , a worst - case reconstruction error that follows @xmath44 can be reached by various reconstruction methods ( _ e.g. _ , basis pursuit denoise  @xcite or iterative hard thresholding  @xcite ) as soon as a suitably rescaled sensing matrix @xmath45 respects the restricted isometry property ( rip )  @xcite .",
    "thus , when the compressive observations of a  @xmath11-sparse signal undergo uniform scalar quantization , it is then expected that , with high probability ,  @xmath46 by setting  @xmath47 . the constancy of this error with respect to  @xmath2",
    "is also known as the classical error limit of the _ pulse code modulation scheme _ ( pcm ) in cs  @xcite .",
    "however , most of the reconstruction techniques enforce a @xmath3-norm fidelity with  @xmath21 , _",
    "e.g. _ , by imposing  @xmath48 , and the reconstructed signal is not guaranteed to be consistent with the observations , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath49 \\neq { \\boldsymbol}q$ ] .",
    "the knowledge of the sensing model is thus not fully exploited for reconstructing  @xmath15 from  @xmath21 .",
    "in the context of signal representations using frames , it is also known that , for unit - norm frame vectors , if the frame coefficients of a signal are corrupted by an additive noise of variance  @xmath50 , the linear signal estimate synthesized from the dual frame on these coefficients has a root mean square error ( rmse ) lower bounded by  @xcite @xmath51 where the expectation is taken with respect to the noise .",
    "this shows that for fcq the reconstruction error decay of such a linear reconstruction is limited to  @xmath52 since  @xmath53 .",
    "nevertheless , the produced solution is also inconsistent with the observations , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath54 $ ] , as the signal synthesis reached by the dual frame  @xmath55 amounts to solving the least - squares problem  @xmath56 , which promotes an  @xmath3-norm fidelity with respect to  @xmath21 .",
    "this work studies a better approach for improving the reconstruction error decay in both qcs and fcq .",
    "the proposed analysis explicitly enforces quantization consistency while reconstructing the signal , _",
    "i.e. _ , finding an estimate  @xmath57 such that  @xmath58    = { \\mathcal}q[{\\boldsymbol}a{\\boldsymbol}x]$ ] .",
    "this procedure was initially introduced in  @xcite for oversampled analog - to - digital conversion of bandlimited signals , or in  @xcite in the more general context of quantized overcomplete signal expansion . in more detail ,",
    "@xcite  showed that , given a random model on the generation of the sensed signal , the rmse of any reconstruction method is lower bounded by @xmath6 .",
    "interestingly , the same lower bound can also be obtained on the worst - case reconstruction error without requiring any random model on the source  @xcite . while conjectured for general frames with redundancy factor  @xmath59 , the combination of a tight frame formed by an oversampled discrete fourier transform ( dft ) with a consistent signal reconstruction reaches this lower bound , _",
    "i.e. _ , in this case the rmse is upper bounded by  @xmath7  @xcite . numerically , the reconstruction errors of recovery methods based on alternate projections onto convex sets by alternate projections between the image of  @xmath22 and the consistency cell  @xmath60 $ ] , these two sets being convex .",
    "the signal is reconstructed from the pocs solution using the dual frame . ]",
    "( pocs ) @xcite or on message passing algorithms  @xcite , have also been observed to approach  @xmath7 for both deterministic and random  @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , the rangan - goyal recursive algorithm @xcite , which enforces local consistency of the current estimate at every iteration , provides reconstruction error decaying as  @xmath61 for random frames , where the expectation is made on the ( uniform ) quantization noise  @xcite .",
    "more recently , powell and whitehouse  @xcite have analyzed geometrically the worst - case error of any consistent reconstruction method .",
    "as detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : prior - works ] , they showed for instance that , for frames constructed by taking  @xmath2 vectors picked uniformly at random over the unit sphere  @xmath62 , the expectation of this error with respect to the random frame construction decays as  @xmath63 .",
    "we can also mention that consistent reconstruction methods have been applied to qcs in the high - resolution regime ( _ i.e. _ , for  @xmath64 when  @xmath65 ) @xcite ; for uniform ( or bounded ) noise for fcq  @xcite ; in the extreme 1-bit qcs setting , where quantization reduces to the application of a sign operator @xcite ; and even for non - regular quantization scheme in qcs  @xcite .",
    "compared to these former works , we highlight three important features of this paper .",
    "these are only sketched in this introduction and we refer the reader to sec .  [",
    "sec : main - results ] for their precise statements .",
    "first , we analyse the fcq and the qcs contexts when  @xmath22 is generated as a gaussian random matrix and when the scalar quantization incorporates a uniform _ dithering _",
    "as will be clear later , this dithering , which is often used to improve the statistical properties of the quantizer and is assumed to be known in signal reconstruction , allows us to leverage a geometric connection between quantized gaussian random projections of vectors and buffon s needle problem  @xcite .",
    "second , we provide upper bounds for the worst - case reconstruction error of consistent signal estimations , _",
    "i.e. _ , valid for the reconstruction of any vector in the signal set  @xmath16 .",
    "those bounds hold with high ( and controlled ) probability over the generation of both  @xmath22 and the dithering as soon as  @xmath2 is large compared to the _ complexity _ of the signal space  @xmath16 .",
    "for instance , in the case of fcq with gaussian random frames and  @xmath66 , we show that if  @xmath2 is bigger than a minimal value growing like @xmath67 , then , with high probability , the distance between any pair of vectors in  @xmath16 having consistent observations through the mapping   can not be larger than  @xmath10 ( see theorem  [ thm : consist - impose - closeness ] ) . inverting the relationship between  @xmath10 and the minimal  @xmath2 ,",
    "this establishes also that with high probability , the distance between consistent vectors decays like  @xmath68  ( see corollary  [ cor : bound - distance ] ) .",
    "similar bounds are also obtained in the case of qcs of bounded sparse signals when the sensing matrix is a gaussian random ensemble .",
    "then , with high probability , if  @xmath2 exceeds a minimal number of measurements growing like  @xmath69 , the distance between two consistent  @xmath11-sparse vectors can not be larger than @xmath10 ( see theorem  [ thm : consist - impose - closeness - saprse - case ] ) .",
    "equivalently , with high probability , their distance must then decay like  @xmath70 ( see corollary  [ cor : bound - distance ] ) .",
    "finally , we evaluate the impact of relaxing the consistency requirement , _",
    "i.e. _ , allowing for a certain level of inconsistent observations , on the reconstruction error of ideal estimators based on this relaxed condition",
    ". this is done by studying the proximity of two vectors of  @xmath16 when their mappings in differ by no more than  @xmath71 components .",
    "we show that if this level @xmath71 is constant with respect to the evolution of  @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. _ , what we call _ almost perfect consistency _ , the previous consistency bounds are basically unchanged up to a modification by a multiplicative factor proportional to @xmath72 for fcq and to @xmath73 for qcs ( see  theorem  [ thm : bound - distance - almost - consist ] ) .",
    "however , in the case where @xmath71 can reach a constant fraction of  @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath74 for  @xmath75 , then , provided  @xmath76 , a bias impacts the proximity of two vectors in  @xmath16 differing by no more than  @xmath71 components in their quantized mapping . with high probability , the distance between any such vectors is then smaller than the sum of two terms , one that still decays with  @xmath2 and another that is lower bounded by  @xmath77 ( see  theorem  [ thm : propor - consist ] ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we start by providing the precise statement of our main results in sec .",

    "notice that  @xmath470 .",
    "let us focus on this last probability , keeping in mind the relationships between these parameters for estimating later a result which is not conditioned to the knowledge of  @xmath471 .",
    "we follow the procedure described in @xcite . in this work , from a generalization of the buffon s needle problem  @xcite in  @xmath23 dimensions , it is shown that when @xmath412 , _ i.e. _ , when  @xmath472 and  @xmath473 , computing @xmath474 above is equivalent to estimating the probability that a segment ( or _ needle _ ) of length  @xmath475 uniformly `` thrown '' at random in  @xmath1 , both spatially and in orientation , does not intersect a fixed set of parallel  @xmath103-dimensional hyperplanes spaced by a distance @xmath157 .    more precisely , given  @xmath462 and  @xmath476 $ ] , the function  @xmath477 is piecewise constant in  @xmath1 and the frontiers where its value changes correspond to a set of parallel  @xmath103-dimensional hyperplanes in  @xmath1 .",
    "these hyperplanes are equi - spaced with a separating distance @xmath157 and they are all normal to the direction  @xmath478 . consequently , the quantity  @xmath479 counts the number of such hyperplanes intersecting the segment  @xmath480 . in this scenario ,",
    "this segment is thus fixed and the hyperplanes are randomly oriented and shifted by  @xmath478 and  @xmath481 , respectively .    however",
    ", we can reverse the point of view and rather consider those hyperplanes as fixed and normal , _",
    "e.g. _ , to the first canonical axis  @xmath482 of  @xmath1 .",
    "this is allowed by considering the affine mapping  @xmath483 implicitly defined by any combination of a rotation and of a translation in  @xmath1 such that  @xmath484 for all  @xmath485 . in words , thanks to  @xmath486 , projecting a point  @xmath485 onto the random orientation  @xmath478 and shifting the result by  @xmath481 is equivalent to projecting the random point  @xmath487 onto  @xmath482 .",
    "therefore , denoting  @xmath488 and @xmath489 , it is easy to see that the  @xmath490-length segment  @xmath491 , _ i.e. _ , our _ needle _ , is then oriented uniformly at random over  @xmath171 while the distance of its centrum  @xmath492 to the closest hyperplane follows a uniform random variable over the interval  @xmath493 $ ] .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath494 so that  @xmath229 actually measures the number of intersections the segment  @xmath491 makes with the set of hyperplanes  @xmath495 . in @xcite ,",
    "the distribution of the discrete bounded random variable  @xmath229 is actually fully determined and denoted  @xmath496 .        for  @xmath497 , eq .",
    "shows that we must now consider the two neighboring  @xmath3-balls of  @xmath498 and  @xmath21 in  @xmath474 and estimate the probability that at least two points of these balls share the same dithered quantized projection onto @xmath478 .",
    "following the same argument as above , this new problem is now equivalent to a new buffon experiment if the previous needle is ended with two balls . in other words ,",
    "we create a _ dumbbell _ shape formed by a segment of length  @xmath490 on the extremities of which two balls of radius  @xmath71 are centered ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dumbbell - problem ] ) .",
    "it is then easy to see that  @xmath474 is equivalent to the probability that there is no hyperplane of  @xmath499 intersecting only the part of the segment outside of the two balls when the dumbbell is thrown randomly in  @xmath1 as for previous buffon s needle .",
    "otherwise , having such an intersection would mean that no pair of points ( taken in distinct balls ) lie in the same subvolume delimited by two consecutive hyperplanes , _",
    "i.e. _ , they do not have the same quantized projection , and conversely .",
    "let us parametrize this dumbbell by its distance  @xmath500)$ ] ( estimated from the middle of the segment ) to the closest hyperplane  @xmath499 and by its orientation drawn uniformly at random in  @xmath171 . by symmetry , only the angle  @xmath501 $ ] made by the dumbbell with the normal vector  @xmath482 to  @xmath499 is important in this parametrization  @xcite .",
    "moreover , from fig .  [",
    "fig : dumbbell - problem ] , the absence of intersection amounts to imposing @xmath502 .",
    "the probability  @xmath503 is thus obtained by @xmath504 where @xmath505 is the area ( normalized to the one of  @xmath171 ) of the thin spherical segment  @xmath506\\}$ ] , where  @xmath507 and @xmath508 is the beta function .",
    "let us define two angles  @xmath511 such that  @xmath512 and  @xmath513 , assuming  @xmath514 ( otherwise ,  @xmath515 ) .",
    "the angular integration domain can be split in three intervals :  @xmath516 $ ] ,  @xmath517 $ ] and @xmath518 $ ] . over the first interval ,",
    "the integral is always zero since , either we have a zero measure interval ( @xmath519 ) or  @xmath520 since  @xmath521 and  @xmath522 . moreover , over the last interval  @xmath518 $ ] ,  @xmath523      let us study this last integral and the function  @xmath527 .",
    "we can verify that @xmath528 is convex and reads @xmath529 moreover , by integrating by part , @xmath530 the positive measure  @xmath531 has unit mass over  @xmath532 $ ] so that , by convexity of  @xmath533 and using jensen s inequality , @xmath534 however , since @xmath535 we find @xmath536 and @xmath537    from the definition of  @xmath533 above , if  @xmath538 , @xmath539 and we can not show anything .",
