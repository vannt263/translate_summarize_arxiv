    "however , it is still desirable to derive their result following the standard process of quantum field theory - path integral . after a lot of works on direct integration over the moduli space of instantons , nekrasov @xcite applied the localization theorem for toric actions to compute the equivariant integral over the instanton moduli space .",
    "subsequently , it was noted by @xcite that a similar approach also applies to the instanton calculus of @xmath3 supersymmetric gauge theory where @xmath2 theory is perturbed by a superpotential @xmath4 . here",
    "the integration is localized to the summation over the ( isolated ) fixed points labeled by the young diagrams , which are in some sense regarded as saddle points .",
    "one might expect the instanton calculus on the saddle points has more applications than kinematical constraints .",
    "the computation of the holomorphic quantities in @xmath3 theory such as effective superpotential is related to matrix model in @xcite .",
    "this proposal is derived by relating them to the b - model topological string amplitudes on certain non - compact calabi - yau manifold .",
    "the relation is a mirror to a gauge / string duality due to the geometric transition on the a - model side @xcite .",
    "thus the reproduction of the holomorphic quantities in @xmath3 theory from the microscopic instanton calculus can be regarded as a check of the gauge / string correspondence involving the matrix model .",
    "for a recent progress in microscopic approach to @xmath3 supersymmetric gauge theory , see @xcite .",
    "though the localization formulas are given explicitly for both the partition function and the chiral correlation functions , in general it is not straightforward to perform the summation over the young diagrams exactly . in the maximally confining phase of @xmath5 supersymmetric gauge theory gauge theory .",
    "however , the existence of underlying @xmath5 theory should be assumed , since we will consider the expansion in the second chern number whose meaning is lost in a genuine @xmath0 theory .",
    "] , where @xmath6 is confined and the residual symmetry at low energy is the diagonal @xmath7 , the task of summation gets considerably tractable . in @xcite , we adopted the standard correspondence between young diagrams and neutral states in the fermion fock space and calculated explicitly the chiral one - point functions @xmath8 in the maximally confining phase .",
    "we found that the results can be summarized compactly in terms of the loop operator : @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the modified bessel function .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the loop operator has two parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the series expansion in @xmath13 is the instanton expansion of gauge theory , while that in @xmath12 is interpreted as the genus expansion of the corresponding string theory . in the gauge / string theory correspondence , the partition function and",
    "the correlation functions allow the double perturbative expansion in the instanton number of gauge theory and the genus of the string theory .",
    "usually we can sum up the expansion only in one of the two expansion parameters , but have to compute the functions order by order in the other parameter .",
    "it is very amusing that the above result gives an example where we can perform the summation of the double expansion completely in a closed form .",
    "the chiral one - point functions @xmath8 in @xmath3 theory do not detect the superpotential @xmath4 which is used to deform the original @xmath2 theory @xcite . in this paper",
    "we would like to proceed to the computation of the chiral glueball one - point functions @xmath14 , which depend on the details of @xmath4 .",
    "the chiral glueball one - point functions were obtained previously by several methods .",
    "for example , one can relate the holomorphic ( @xmath15-term ) quantities in supersymmetric gauge theory to amplitudes of topological string theory @xcite and then compute with matrix model using open / closed string duality @xcite .",
    "we can also relate the correlation functions to the generalized konishi anomaly and perform a purely field theoretical computation @xcite .",
    "the resulting glueball resolvent is given by @xmath16 with an unknown polynomial @xmath17 which is determined so that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath18 in @xmath19 is @xmath20 .",
    "in the maximally confining phase , the polynomial @xmath17 is further tuned so that the square root is factorized into @xmath21 in matrix model the maximally confining phase is described by a one - cut solution , while on the moduli space of seiberg - witten theory it corresponds to the degenerating loci where the maximal number of mutually non - intersecting cycles of the seiberg - witten curve collapse . in this paper",
    "we would like to add one more method to derive the glueball resolvent @xmath18 .",
    "we find our instanton calculus gives an exact agreement to the result with the factorization .",
    "the reproduction of previously known results should serve as a non - trivial consistency check of the instanton calculus .",
    "besides , along the way of computation we also find an explicit expression of the polynomial @xmath17 that causes the complete factorization .",
    "it is interesting that our @xmath0 instanton calculus automatically gives a closed form for the glueball resolvent in the maximally confining phase .",
    "the plan of the present paper is as follows .",
    "we will shortly review some necessary ingredients of the instanton calculus in section 2 . before proceeding to our computation of the chiral glueball one - point functions in section 4",

    "we shall omit the subscripts @xmath25 or @xmath34 of the correlators hereafter as long as it is clear from the context .",
    "the strategy to calculate these correlation functions is to first replace all the operators by their equivariant extensions @xcite : @xmath47 with @xmath48 being the equivariantly closed forms @xmath49 the curvature @xmath50 of the universal bundle over @xmath51 is expanded according to the direct product structure of the base space as follows appears in the adhm construction as the zero modes of the dirac operator . ] : @xmath52 if we untwist the theory in this paper . in general the topological twist of @xmath25 theory is possible on the khler manifold . ] , the components @xmath53 and @xmath54 are identified with the field strength and the gaugino , which gives a vector multiplet in @xmath25 theory .",
    "the remaining pair @xmath55 and @xmath56 gives a chiral multiplet .",

[ 1.0 ]    ( 20,20 ) ( -33,27)(10,10)@xmath15      the above argument can be easily generalized to any monomial superpotential . to compute the glueball one - point function for a superpotential @xmath188 we have to pick up the @xmath189-terms in the right hand side of : @xmath190 } \\binom{k - l}{m}\\,\\frac{k - l-2m}{u}i_{k - l-2m}(2\\sqrt{q}u)~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the laplace transformation formula",
    ", we find the resolvent is given by @xmath191}\\binom{k - l}{m}\\,z^{k - l-2m}~. \\label{resolventhalf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note again that the result takes the form of @xmath192 .",
    "to see the result is the expected one , we have to show @xmath193 .",
    "this can be done by adding the `` conjugate '' . in this way",
    ", we will complete `` half '' of the binomial expansion in into a full one except constant terms .",
    "finally we find @xmath194 with the force @xmath195 given by @xmath196 } \\sqrt{q}^{2l}a^{k-2l}\\frac{k!}{(k-2l)!(l!)^2}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the potential is even , the force is odd and we can always make @xmath197 by setting @xmath97 .",
    "this means that in the even potential we can stabilize the cut at the center .",
    "however , this does not work for the odd monomial potentials .",
    "if the superpotential is @xmath198 , the glueball resolvent is given as @xmath199~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the force felt by the cut is given as @xmath200 while if the potential is @xmath201 , the glueball resolvent is @xmath202 -2\\sqrt{q}a\\frac{2!}{1!1!}\\biggl[\\frac{1!}{0!1!}z\\biggr]~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the force is @xmath203 ^ 2\\biggr)~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence for the potential of the linear combination @xmath204 we have to impose the force balance condition : @xmath205 ^ 2\\biggr)=0~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as is clear from the above example the linearity holds for any superpotential .",
    "therefore , as long as we are careful with the force balance condition , we can reproduce the results of all the superpotentials in the maximally confining phase .",
    "so far we have computed the classical limit of the glueball one - point function by instanton calculus and found a complete agreement with the matrix model result . in the computation",
    "we have to introduce an equivariant parameter @xmath12 for the toric action on @xmath206 , which can be related to the ( local ) @xmath207 rotations of the @xmath208-background @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath12-expansion of the scalar one - point and two - point functions computed in this paper agrees to the genus expansion of the gromov - witten theory of @xmath1 developed in @xcite .",
    "the correspondence is described as follows : okounkov and pandharipande computed all genus correlation functions of the khler class @xmath209 and its descendents @xmath210 ( the so - called stable sector ) with respect to the two ramification data at the north and the south poles of @xmath1 , which are labeled by the partitions . to obtain the gauge theory correlation functions",
    "we identify the operator @xmath211 as the cohomology class @xmath210 .",
    "then , the @xmath44-instanton sector is recovered by taking both the ramification data to be @xmath212 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the same glueball one - point function was evaluated in @xcite by relating the holomorphic quantities in supersymmetric gauge theory to amplitudes of topological string theory @xcite and computing with the matrix model using open / closed string duality . here",
    "the loop expansion parameter of the matrix model was interpreted as the genus expansion parameter of topological string theory , which , on the gauge theory side , was identified with a constant graviphoton background .",
    "a comparison between instanton calculus and matrix model at higher genus through topological string amplitudes was made in @xcite .    although it was pointed out @xcite that the @xmath208-background and the graviphoton background are different , here we would like to compute the first order correction to the one - point function on both backgrounds and compare with each other , because these two backgrounds look similar and share the interpretation of genus expansion .",
    "we shall start with computing the @xmath12-correction of the glueball one - point function from the instanton calculus in subsection 5.1 and proceed to recapitulating the matrix model computation in subsection 5.2 . comparing the result of the glueball one - point function from the instanton calculus with the result of the one - point function in the matrix model or",
    ", we find a discrepancy .",
    "though we can not find any way to relate the two results , we still expect there to be a relation between these two genus expansions , for example , by change of variables .",
    "let us study the @xmath12-corrections of the glueball one - point function .",
    "we shall choose the simplest gaussian superpotential here .",
    "since the connected two - point function is given as @xmath213 we find the @xmath12-corrections of the glueball one - point function is @xmath214 where we have used identities of the modified bessel function @xmath215 therefore the glueball resolvent is @xmath216^{5/2}}\\biggr\\}~. \\label{gluinocorr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the following formula holds for the laplace transformation @xmath217 if we denote the laplace transformation as @xmath218 .",
    "the computation on the matrix model side can be performed with several methods .",
    "the first method is due to loop equation : the resolvent in the matrix model is determined by the loop equation .",
    "we shall consider the matrix model with potential @xmath219 : @xmath220 the loop equation for the resolvent @xmath221 , @xmath222 ( see ( 13.52 ) in @xcite . ) gives @xmath223 at one loop .",
    "for the gaussian model @xmath224 , the one - loop contribution is only non - vanishing for @xmath225 with @xmath226 .",
    "hence , the resolvent for @xmath19 should behave as @xmath227 .",
    "this means there is no pole at @xmath228 and we can perform the @xmath229 integration easily by picking up the pole at @xmath230 : @xmath231 the right - hand - side is a two - point loop correlator and given by @xcite @xmath232 therefore we find @xmath233    for the case of the gaussian matrix model , an exact manipulation is possible .",
    "the exact solution for gaussian matrix model @xmath234 is given by @xcite @xmath235 up to genus one .",
    "after the laplace transformation we find @xmath236",
