    "how extracellular electric fields  as generated endogenously or through transcranial brain stimulation  affect the dynamics of neuronal populations is of great interest but not well understood . to study neuronal activity at the network level single - compartment neuron models",
    "have been proven very successful , because of their computational efficiency and analytical tractability .",
    "unfortunately , these models lack the dendritic morphology to biophysically account for the effects of electric fields , and for changes in synaptic integration due to morphology alone . here",
    ", we consider a canonical , spatially extended model neuron and characterize its responses to fluctuating synaptic input as well as an oscillatory , weak electric field . in order to accurately reproduce these responses",
    "we analytically derive an extension for the popular integrate - and - fire point neuron models .",
    "we show that the dendritic cable acts as a filter for the synaptic input current , which depends on the input location , and that an electric field modulates the neuronal spike rate strongest at a certain ( preferred ) field frequency .",
    "these phenomena can be successfully reproduced using integrate - and - fire models , extended by a small number of components that are straightforward to implement .",
    "the extended point models are thus well suited for studying populations of coupled neurons with different morphology , exposed to extracellular electric fields .",
    "extracellular electric fields in the brain and their impact on neural activity have gained a considerable amount of attention in neuroscience over the past decade .",
    "these electric fields can be generated endogenously @xcite or through transcranial ( alternating ) current stimulation @xcite , and can modify the activity of neuronal populations in various ways @xcite .",
    "although the fields generated by this type of noninvasive brain stimulation are rather weak ( @xmath0 @xcite ) and do not directly elicit spikes , they can modulate spiking activity and lead to changes in cognitive processing , offering a range of possible clinical interventions @xcite .",
    "how external fields lead to changes of the membrane voltage in single cells has been studied in detail @xcite . however , their effects on population spike rate and the underlying mechanisms are largely unexplored",
    ".    computational models of neurons exposed to electric fields offer a useful tool to gain a better understanding of these mechanisms .",
    "multi - compartment models of neurons are well suited for corresponding investigations at the level of single cells and small circuits @xcite but are too complex for a purposeful application in large populations .",
    "single - compartment ( point ) neuron models of the integrate - and - fire ( if ) type are well applicable to study the dynamics of large neuronal populations , due to their computational efficiency and analytical tractability @xcite . however , typical if model neurons lack the dendritic morphology required for a biophysical description of electric field effects .",
    "furthermore , even in the absence of an extracellular field , the dendritic morphology strongly shapes neuronal response properties @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we extend the popular class of if point neuron models to quantitatively account for morphology dependent modulations of neural activity due to : ( i ) dendritic influences on the integration of synaptic inputs and ( ii ) the effects of extracellular electric fields .",
    "furthermore , we describe how oscillatory electric fields affect neuronal subthreshold and spiking activity and identify field - induced spike rate resonance .",
    "specifically , we considered a canonical spatial pyramidal neuron model which consists of a somatic compartment and one ( apical main ) passive dendritic cable , and which is exposed to in - vivo like fluctuating synaptic input and an electric field . based on that model",
    "we analytically derived an extension for the classical leaky and the refined exponential , @xcite , if point neuron models in order to exactly reproduce the subthreshold dynamics of the spatial model for arbitrary parametrizations .",
    "we then evaluated the extended if models by quantitatively comparing their spiking activity with the spiking activity of the corresponding spatial model .",
    "finally , we used these models to study the effects of an oscillating electric field ( due to the presence of the dendritic cable ) on the spike rate dynamics .",
    "our derivation of the extended point neuron model consists of two steps .",
    "we first calculate the somatic membrane voltage of a ball - and - stick ( bs ) model in response to subthreshold synaptic inputs at the soma and the distal dendrite and to a time - varying , spatially homogeneous , extracellular electric field .",
    "this involves solving a generalized cable equation @xcite .",

    "a similar extension for point model neurons to reproduce dendritic input integration of model cells with complex morphology has been recently proposed in @xcite . using the green s function formalism",

    "overall , it performs well for suprathreshold inputs , particularly in case of distal inputs and for somatic inputs that are not too strong . that performance could be further enhanced by optimizing the reset voltage to better reflect the remaining dendritic membrane depolarization in the bs model after each spike , as was mentioned previously .    in our study",
    "we have considered passive dendrites .",
    "nonlinear ( spike - generating ) currents along the dendrite , which cause nonlinear synaptic input integration @xcite , could be incorporated using our approach in a `` quasi - active '' framework @xcite . this would involve solving the cable equation with linearized nonlinear components , similarly as for the exponential terms used here ( eif case ) .",
    "we investigated in detail the effects of a spatially homogeneous , oscillating , weak electric field , as induced by transcranial electrical stimulation , on the activity of the bs neuron .",
    "such a one - dimensional spatial ( cable plus soma ) model provides a good approximation for neurons with elongated ( apical ) dendrites exposed to a uniform extracellular electrical field as long as the dendritic ( apical main ) cable is not substantially smaller than its electrotonic length  @xcite . following the somatic doctrine @xcite , we focused on the effects of the field that are due to the polarization of the membrane voltage at the soma .",
    "we analytically calculated the subthreshold voltage response , whose properties are in accordance with electrophysiological observations : the response magnitude scales linearly with the field amplitude @xcite , as shown by the sensitivity in fig .",
    "this sensitivity is of the same order of magnitude as that measured in pyramidal cells @xcite , i.e. , around 0.30  mm for low frequency fields , and decreases with increasing field frequency in a morphology dependent manner @xcite . for non - uniform electric fields , e.g. ,",
    "as generated by point source stimulation , however , the sensitivity can be roughly constant for frequencies up to at least 100  hz @xcite .",
    "interestingly , such a behavior can also be observed for a uniform field in case of a rather short dendritic cable ( cf .",
    "[ fig6]b ) .    while polarization effects due to direct current fields have been extensively studied @xcite ,",
    "the effects of time - varying fields are less well understood .",
    "the response of the subthreshold membrane voltage to time - varying fields has been calculated in @xcite for a finite dendritic cable with leaky currents at one end , and in @xcite for a spatially non - uniform field . using a one - dimensional cable model @xcite showed that the electrotonic length is a key quantity that determines the neuronal subthreshold response to an electric field .",
    "specifically , elongated neurons are less sensitive to high frequency fields than compact ones .",
    "how the voltage response to an input current at a particular location along the cable depends on input frequency is largely determined by the membrane time constant . in case of an electrical field , however , which corresponds to symmetrical stimulation at both ends of the cable , the voltage response is also strongly influenced by currents flowing through the low - resistant intracellular medium .",
    "this results in an enhanced high frequency response to an extracellular field when compared to an input current  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a somatic compartment was not considered in these studies . using the bs model we have shown that the relative size of the soma compared to the dendritic cable substantially affects the neuronal sensitivity to the field .",
    "further , we found frequency - dependent spike rate modulation ( and hence , spike field coherence ) caused by the electric field . unlike neuronal subthreshold sensitivity , spike rate modulation amplitude did not decrease with the field frequency and its precise relationship to field frequency depended on the synaptic input location .",
    "spike rate modulation exhibited a clear resonance in the beta and gamma frequency bands in presence of only somatic inputs ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] , b in ) , whereas for only distal dendritic inputs , spike rate modulation amplitudes are strongest at much larger frequencies ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig_frates_dend ] , c in ) .",
    "this can be linked to a theoretical result showing that the response of single - compartment model neurons to high frequency inputs is stronger for larger autocorrelation times of a fluctuating synaptic input current @xcite . since fluctuating",
    "synaptic inputs arriving at the distal dendrite are low - pass filtered , the autocorrelation time of the corresponding input current felt by the soma is increased ( or rather limited from below ) . spike rate resonance frequencies were lower for eif neurons as compared to lif neurons , in particular for background inputs only at the distal dendrite .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that the presence of the exponential term , describing the spike initiating sodium current , decreases the rate response to high frequency inputs @xcite ( see also the analytical results in @xcite ) . in all cases , the amplitude of the modulation also depended on the input strength ( input mean and noise intensity ) , but its relationship to field frequency was not strongly affected by the input parameters .",
    "recently it has been shown that purkinje neurons , due to their large dendritic trees , exhibit spike rate resonance at rather high frequencies in response to somatic input modulations and in the presence of noisy dendritic input ( * ? ? ?",
    "5a ) , which is qualitatively similar to the field - induced resonance effects described here ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig_frates_dend ] and [ fig9]c )",
    ". it should be noted , however , that an oscillatory ( spatially uniform ) external field corresponds to oscillatory input currents with opposite sign at the soma and the distal dendrite , respectively ( cf . eqs .",
    "[ eq : bsmodel_bc_soma ] and [ eq : bsmodel_bc_end ] ) .",
    "the effects of the field can thus not be easily anticipated from those of an input current modulation at the soma alone .",
    "furthermore , the dendritic membrane surface compared to the somatic one for purkinje cells @xcite is substantially larger than that of pyramidal neurons as considered here , which additionally impedes to directly relate the results .    existing experimental studies on the modulation of neuronal activity by extracellular fields",
    "have considered a small number of field frequencies ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "therefore , our results on spike rate resonance are currently not completely confirmed and may be regarded as predictions . in accordance with our findings weak alternating electric fields ( of 30  hz ) have been shown to increase the spiking coherence of pyramidal cells in rat hippocampal slices @xcite , where this increase was proportional to the subthreshold membrane polarization .",
    "moreover , spatially uniform extracellular fields with high - frequency components entrained spiking activity in ferret primary visual cortex more effectively than fields that only contain low - frequency components ( * ? ? ?",
    "our predictions on spike rate modulation by an oscillating electric field are thus in agreement with current knowledge and are informative for future experimental studies .",
    "those results may further be of potential interest for the design of transcranial electrical stimulation protocols .",
    "regarding the point model extension , we analytically derived an expression for an input current to reproduce the effect of the field as extracted from the biophysically grounded bs model .",
    "the amplitude and phase of this input current depend on the parameters of the bs neuron and the electric field .",
    "previously , simple phenomenologically obtained input currents have been used for point neuron network simulations , with either constant amplitudes ( across frequencies ) @xcite or amplitudes fitted to electrophysiological data @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the latter study used an input current whose magnitude decreases with increasing frequency , in contrast to the equivalent current we obtained ( whose magnitude increases with frequency up to 10  khz ) . the neuronal subthreshold sensitivity in that study and the ones shown here , however , are similar .",
    "this apparent discrepancy in the currents describing the field effect may be explained by the impedance of the applied model neurons , which naturally influences the equivalent input current . in @xcite",
    "the model parameters ( and thus the impedance ) were not fitted to real cells ; hence it is unlikely that the model impedance matched with the impedance of the cells from which the current amplitudes were estimated @xcite .",
    "the successful reproduction of the bs spike rate modulation due to the field by the ep model presented here supports the high - pass properties of the equivalent input current .    in the present study , we derived an extension for point neuron models of the lif and eif types .",
