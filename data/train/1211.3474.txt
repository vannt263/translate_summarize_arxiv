    "particle acceleration events in the quasi - collisionless plasma of the solar corona create supra - thermal electron beams that propagate along magnetic field lines , either away from the sun into interplanetary space ( on so - called `` open '' field lines ) , or downwards into the chromosphere ( towards the footpoints of magnetic loops ) .",
    "higher - energy electrons race ahead of the lower energy ones , creating a bump - in - tail instability in the particle distribution .",
    "landau resonance with the unstable electron beams creates langmuir waves , which are believed to undergo non - linear wave - wave interaction and produce electromagnetic emissions at the local plasma frequency or its harmonic . as the electron beam propagates to higher or lower altitudes ( at speeds of @xmath13 in the low corona , to @xmath14 at 1 au , *",
    "* ) , and hence to lower or higher densities and plasma frequencies , there is a drift in the frequency of emitted radiation .",
    "this coherent plasma emission is generally called a type iii radio burst .",
    "type iiis have been observed from frequencies as high as @xmath151 ghz at the bottom of the corona to 30 khz at @xmath151 au , and even lower further out .",
    "taking only bursts drifting from high to low frequencies , @xcite have fitted bursts in the 74 to 550 mhz range by the relation @xmath16",
    "-0.01 @xmath17 mhz s@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite have investigated the peak flux distributions of 40 years of spatially - integrated solar radio burst data , from 0.1 ghz to 37 ghz .",
    "they have found that the peak flux density distribution of events , @xmath18 followed a power - law with a negative index @xmath151.8 , similar to that found in many x - ray studies ( for recent work on the topic , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this work , we have gathered the solar type iii peak flux densities , source sizes and positions at different frequencies , observed by the nanay radioheliograph ( nrh ) over the period 1998-jan-01 to 2008-apr-01 , i.e. covering nearly a full solar cycle .    in section [",
    "sect : selection ] , we describe the data selection process and some of its limitations .",
    "we describe the observations in section [ sect : observations ] and discuss them in section [ sect : discussion ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sect : ccl ] , we summarize our results and present some conclusions to this study .",
    "we selected our events from the list of solar radio bursts published by the _ national oceanographic and atmospheric administration s national geophysical data center _ ( noaa / ngdc ) , from 1998 january 1 to 2008 april 1 , covering almost a full solar cycle .",
    "we removed all bursts that were outside the observing times and spectral range ( @xmath19150450 mhz ) of the _ nanay radioheliograph _",
    "( nrh , * ? ? ? * ) . we have not gone further than april 2008 because nrh started observing the sun with a different set of frequencies , and we wanted a consistent set of frequencies for our statistical study .",
    "the noaa list contains information on individual radio bursts , such as reporting station , start and end times and frequencies , as well as spectral type and intensity .",
    "this list is compiled from reports , often generated manually , by observers from various ground stations around earth ( culgoora , ismiran , learmonth , ondrejov , palehua , sagamore hill , san vito , bleien , etc . ) , using spectrometers covering varying bands , from as low as @xmath1930 mhz to as high as a few ghz .",
    "hence , certain characteristics such as start and end frequencies , as well as burst intensity , are somewhat subject to both individual spectrometer sensitivity and individual observer s perception . in cases",
    "where the same event was reported more than once ( by different observatories ) , only the first such report was kept , and any extraneous ignored .",
    "we kept only type iii radio burst reports within the times ( @xmath158:30 to 15:30 ut , varying during the year ) and the spectral band ( 150432 mhz ) where the nrh was observing the sun .",
    "groups of decimetric type iiis do not last much longer than a few minutes ( individual ones last about one second ) .",
    "different groups of type iiis , even hours apart , are however sometimes bundled together in a single report . moreover , certain reported time interval are clearly erroneous , probably due to data entry error .",
    "we have therefore ignored all type iii reports longer than 10 minutes , ( which constituted @xmath1914% of type iii reports ) , and were left with 8931 type iii burst reports from 1998 to 2008 .",
    "the nrh actually produces images at up to 1/8 s temporal resolution , but these are stored on magnetic tapes , and each individual day of data must be retrieved manually .",
    "the 10-second data is stored in a file system , and it is therefore much easier and faster to process .",
    "this is the reason why it is used in this study .",
    "this coarse temporal resolution leads to weak and/or short - duration ( such as second - long type iiis ) bursts being drowned in the solar background .",
    "hence , we have decided to retain only well - determined type iii bursts for this study : those which had peak brightness temperature of 10 mk or above , well above any quiet sun value .",
    "this is the case for 91.4% of cases at 164 mhz , down to 26.2% of cases at 432 mhz .",
    "the difference is easily explained by the fact that type iii bursts tend to have lower brightness temperatures at 432 than at 164 mhz ( see also  [ sect : fluxes ] ) . a priori ,",
    "the ngdc - reported burst spectral band is not necessarily a good indicator of the actual bandwidth of the type iii burst .",
    "( nrh , possessing @xmath1544 dishes , is much more sensitive than the single - dish spectrometers that typically report to ngdc ) .",
    "on the other hand , we have empirically observed that taking only bursts either at frequencies for which the peak brightness temperature in the map is above @xmath1510 mk , or within the noaa - reported spectral range , lead to very similar datasets .",
    "the 10-second data used in this study also leads to cases where several individual bursts are being bundled together into a single event . hence , in this work , a `` type iii event '' is often `` a group of type iiis within the same 10-second interval '' .",
    "frequencies 150.9 , 164 , 236.6 , 327 , 410.5 , and 432 mhz ( with a 3-db bandwidth of 0.7 mhz ) were used by nrh during our period of interest .",
    "figure  [ fig : histo_frq_time_distribution ] clearly shows a decrease in radio activity as the solar cycle approaches minimum , and the dip in events from 2003 november 5 to 2004 january 25 is due to nrh being off - line while anti - alias antennas were being added to the array .",
    "during our decade of interest , the 150.9 mhz frequency has gradually replaced the nearby 164 mhz , no longer reserved under french law .",
    "hence the observations at 150.9 mhz have started later , with an overlap of a few years with the ( now no longer used ) 164 mhz . *",
    "it can be noted that the occurrence rates match qualitatively that of @xcite , including an almost @xmath19two - year periodicity , unexplained so far . * using nrh 10-second images , and a fixed 30  pixel resolution at available frequencies ( this standard coarse resolution , still well below the instrumental resolution at 432 mhz , was chosen for ease of data handling ) , the following were determined ( among other things ) : time of peak flux density , location and brightness temperature of brightest pixel in the source , and 2d gaussian fitting parameters to sources present in the image . from the latter , source fluxes",
    "can be deduced by computing the gaussian volume .",
    "it is important to note that each frequency was treated mostly independently from each other , see  [ sect : timeintv ] and [ sect : alias ] for a discussion .",
    "paragraphs 2.1 to 2.6 detail some caveats in our selection and data analysis process .",
    "firstly , as stated earlier , there can be several type iiis temporarily close to one another , within the 10-second accumulation of the data at hand , leading to confusion and averaging of their characteristics .",
    "secondly , our methods looks only for the strongest burst within the noaa report s time interval ( there can be several inside the time range reported ) , and does so for each frequency independently .",
    "this has for consequence that we are missing any other bursts within the reported time interval , and that the burst characteristics derived at different frequencies might not relate to the exact same type iii burst . about @xmath1950% of radio bursts from the same report",
    "have hence a time difference greater than 10 s between 164 and 432 mhz ) .",
    "this has an obvious effect on the absolute occurrence rates of type iii bursts ( they are probably higher than reported here ) , but we estimate the influence on the power - law shape of their distributions ( see  [ sect : observations ] ) to be minimal .      for bursts occurring before the installation of anti - alias antennas at nrh ( between 2003 november 5 and 2004 january 25 )",
    ", there can be an ambiguity in source positions at frequencies above 164 mhz .",
    "this is because an alias is sometime present in the reconstructed nrh image , and sometimes has the brightest pixel in the map ( particularly when the real source happens to be beyond the solar limb , but the alias lies on top of the solar disk ) .",
    "the distance between the real source and an alias decreases with increasing observing frequency , and any alias is beyond the imaged field of view ( and hence no alias ambiguity exists ) at frequencies @xmath20164 mhz .",
    "it is usually easy to distinguish between a solar source lasting at least a few minutes and its alias : the alias moves quickly ( with time ) in a straight line across the solar map . but",
    "this method is of little use in our study , as we examine events that seldom last longer than a single 10-second frame .",
    "we will instead use the fact that the true source is likely to be spatially near the sources at other frequencies , assuming the radio bursts spans the necessary frequency range . for maps taken at progressively higher frequencies than 164 mhz , we determine whether there is possiblity of an alias in the map in the following manner : after locating the source with the brightest pixel , we determine whether there is another source in the map at an appropriate alias position , and with similar peak intensity ( within 20% , which corresponds to a 2 mk difference for the minimal 10 mk burst ) .",
    "the `` correct '' source is deemed to be the one whose position is closest to the position of the `` correct '' source in the map of the next lower frequency .",
    "this simple method is not perfect : in some cases , emission at lower frequencies is simply not there , because the conditions for plasma emission and/or propagation to earth are not adequate , and hence , at higher frequencies , the method may home in on other sources .    before the installation of anti - alias antenna , there was a _ potential _",
    "alias confusion ( two sources of similar intensities , at correct alias positions , as described above ) in our data 58% of the time at 432 mhz , progressively lower at lower frequencies , down to 0% at 164 mhz and below .    in summary , source locations before january 2004",
    ", low frequencies ( 150.9 and 164 mhz ) should be always accurate , while higher frequencies may have errors in some of the positions , but we expect the impact on the statistical distributions of burst locations (  [ sect : locations ] ) to be minimal ( see coronal density fittings in ",
    "[ sect : discussion ] for a confirmation ) .",
    "the study of source sizes (  [ sect : size_distribution ] ) and fluxes (  [ sect : fluxes ] ) should be unaffected by this issue , as is all the data taken after january 2004 .",
    "the so - called `` quiet sun '' flux is of the order of 10 sfu at nrh frequencies ( and brightness temperatures at sun center of @xmath190.7 mk at 164 mhz ) .",
    "hence , a lone , 1-sfu , 1-second long type iii burst with area about 1/100 the solar disc ( i.e. smeared out to about the size of the nrh beam at 164 mhz , * about 3.2 fwhm * ) would produce an additional surface brightness equal to that of the quiet sun in a 10-second image .",
    "successfully fitting a gaussian to such a weak burst becomes difficult , and explains the turnover at low fluxes in the distributions presented in ",
    "[ sect : fluxes ] .",
    "the crab nebula , or one of its alias , is the most obvious astrophysical source which can enter the nrh field of view ( around june each year ) .",
    "its surface brighteness is similar to the sun at nrh frequencies , i.e. much lower than the 10 mk threshold used for our selection .",
    "hence , we expect such sources to have little impact in our study .",
    "earth ionospheric refraction can significantly perturb the apparent position of a source in ground - based observatories , sometimes exceeding several arcmins in the 100300 mhz range ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these effects are mostly random position shifts due to ionospheric gravity waves .",
    "they are not correlated with the positions of sources on the sun , and should not affect our statistics .",
    "we have therefore ignored those effects in the present study .",
    "we have studied in detail the distribution in spatial sizes (  [ sect : size_distribution ] ) , in positions (  [ sect : locations ] ) , in fluxes (  [ sect : fluxes ] ) , and the rank - order cross - correlations between several of the observables (  [ sect : rocorr ] ) .",
    "radio sources were fitted with 2d elliptical gaussians . these yield _ observed _ gaussian sizes @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( semi - major and semi - minor @xmath23-folding lengths ) , and a tilt angle @xmath24 of the semi - major axis with respect to the map x - axis ( solar east - west ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : histo_true_src_sizes_a ] suggests a power - law frequency dependence of the normalization constant @xmath31 , which has led us to infer that the distribution for true source fwhm size @xmath2 could be of the form : @xmath32 we have done two - dimensional fittings of our data , using equation [ eq : size ] as model .",
    "the fitting parameters @xmath33 have been found to be moderately dependent on the choice of fitting intervals ( and , to a lesser extend , the binning ) .",
