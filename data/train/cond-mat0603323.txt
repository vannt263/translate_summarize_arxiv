    "the two isotopes of solid helium , @xmath0he and @xmath2he , are the most prominent examples of quantum solids  @xcite .",
    "these isotopes display highly anharmonic dynamics : their atoms are strongly correlated , loosely bound and make large excursions to the nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the effects are especially significant in the bcc phase of solid helium .",
    "the dynamics of solid @xmath2he , in particular the phonon spectrum , has been studied over years in inelastic neutron scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xmath2he , there are no experimental measurements of phonon spectra of @xmath0he ( in the bcc phase ) due to the large neutron absorption cross - section of this isotope .",
    "@xcite recently , however , the use of inelastic x - ray scattering  @xcite offers the possibility of experimentally determining the phonon branches of @xmath0he .",
    "in addition , new neutron scattering experiments are being planned ,  @xcite which will be able to acquire data for a sufficiently long time to observe inelastic scattering .",
    "the present study has been motivated by these developments .",
    "strong anharmonic effects and atomic correlations make the theoretical calculation of phonon spectra of @xmath0he very difficult .",
    "several theoretical methods have been developed to treat this problem : glyde and khanna devised a self - consistent phonon t - matrix formalism  @xcite , horner applied a many - body perturbation technique  @xcite , and koehler and werthamer employed a variational approach .",
    "these theoretical calculations are based on a variational perturbative theory and implemented at zero - temperature.@xcite the predictions of these models are in quantitative disagreement with each other , due to differences in the effective potentials used to evaluate phonon interactions and details of the numerical methods employed .",
    "@xcite    as a complementary approach to these methods we decided to study the excitations in bcc solid helium @xmath0he , by performing quantum monte carlo simulations at a finite temperature .",
    "we use path integral monte carlo ( pimc)@xcite , which is a non - perturbative numerical method , that allows , in principle , simulations of quantum systems without any assumptions beyond the schr@xmath3dinger equation .",
    "the two body interatomic he - he potential @xcite is the only input for the pimc simulations . in our study",
    "the universal path integral code of ceperley@xcite was adapted to calculate the phonon branches at finite temperature .",
    "the pimc method , in conjunction with maximum entropy ( maxent ) techniques ,  @xcite was employed to calculate the phonon spectra of liquid  @xcite and solid  @xcite helium ( @xmath2he ) at finite temperatures .",
    "the calculated phonon spectra are in good agreement with the spectra measured by inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "the results of our study include the numerical calculation of all the phonon branches of bcc @xmath0he at a molar volume 21.5 cm@xmath0 .",
    "details of our simulations are described in sec .",
    "2 , the results of the calculations are presented in sec .",
    "the pimc method used in our simulations is based on the formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of path integrals .",
    "it has been described in detail by ceperley  @xcite .",
    "the method involves mapping of the quantum system of particles onto a classical model of interacting `` ring polymers '' , whose elements , `` beads '' or `` time - slices '' , are connected by `` springs '' .",
    "the method provides a direct statistical evaluation of quantum canonical averages .",
    "in addition to static properties of the system , dynamical properties can be also extracted from pimc simulations.@xcite    the object of this study is the phonon spectrum , which can be extracted from the dynamic structure factor , @xmath4 .",
    "the definition of @xmath4 in terms of density fluctuations is @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the momentum and energy ( we take @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 is the fourier transform of the density of the solid , and @xmath10 is the number density .",
    "@xmath4 is usually expressed in terms of phonons , by writing @xmath4 as a sum of terms involving the excitation of a single phonon , @xmath11 , a pair of phonons , @xmath12 and higher order terms which also include interference between different terms .",
    "@xcite in most of our simulations we calculated the @xmath13 term .",
    "some calculations of @xmath4 were also performed , and will be discussed below .",
    "additional details of the method used to calculate both @xmath13 and @xmath4 and extract phonon spectra are described in our paper .",
    "@xcite    in the simulations we used samples containing between 128 and 432 atoms .",
    "each atom was represented by a `` ring '' polymer with 64 time slices .",
    "@xmath14 was calculated for values of @xmath15 between 0.14 and 1 in relative lattice units ( r.l.u.= 2@xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the lattice parameter ) . the number density was set to @xmath18 and the temperature to t=1.6  k. this particular temperature was chosen to compare the phonon spectrum of @xmath0he with those of @xmath2he calculated at the same temperature  @xcite .",
    "a perfect bcc lattice was prepared for the initial configuration .",
    "the effects of fermi statistics are not taken into account in our simulations , which is a reasonable approximation for the solid phase at t=1.6  k.    statistical errors were estimated by running the pimc simulations at least 10 times , with different initial conditions in each case .",
    "after each run , @xmath14 ( @xmath19 ) was extracted using the maxent method  @xcite .",
    "the phonon energy for a given @xmath20 was then calculated by averaging the positions of the peak of @xmath14 over the set of the simulation runs .",
    "the error bars shown in the figures below represent the standard deviation .",
    "we collected at least @xmath2110000 data points in each simulation run and re - blocked the data  @xcite in blocks of 100 - 200 points  @xcite .",
    "each simulation run took about two weeks of 12 pentium iii pcs running in parallel .",
    "a typical example of the calculated dynamic structure factor @xmath19 along the [ 011 ] direction is shown in fig.[s1 ] .",
    "the figure shows both the longitudinal and transverse phonons . as seen in fig.[s1 ] the two transverse phonons have narrow and almost symmetric line shapes , while the longitudinal phonon is quite broad and asymmetric .",
    "this asymmetry exhibits itself in the form of a relatively steep rise on the low - frequency side and a more gradual decrease on the high - frequency side .",

    "koehler and werthamer suggested that due to the asymmetry of the dynamic structure factor , the phonon frequency can be calculated either at the position of the maximum of @xmath14 or as the mean of the two half - maxima  @xcite .",
