    "bethe s solution of the isotropic spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model in one dimension , by a method known as the coordinate bethe ansatz @xcite , is one of the seminal works in the field of integrable models . for a detailed investigation on the method and",
    "its variants and other related works see references @xcite .",
    "however , deriving the bethe ansatz equations and the form of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors is only one part of the story . the other important part is to extract the numerical values of the rapidities from the set of the bethe ansatz equations . because of the high degree of nonlinearity and multi - variate nature it is practically impossible to analytically solve the bethe ansatz equations even for a modest length of the spin chain .",
    "one , therefore needs to seek numerical solutions using methods , such as , iterations , the newton - raphson , homotopy continuations etc .",
    "there have been some efforts to find the numerical solutions of the bethe ansatz equations using different techniques , and the eigenvalues have been found which have excellent match with direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "apart from the real solutions , which are much easier to find out , there are complex solutions of the bethe ansatz equations , which need extra efforts to calculate .",
    "bethe himself investigated this problem for a finite length spin chain and found that if there are complex solutions then they come in complex conjugate pairs and arrange themselves in a string - like structure @xcite .",
    "these complex solutions , responsible for the formation of bound states , lead to the so - called _ string hypothesis _ @xcite .",
    "importance of numerical computations of all the bethe solutions are in one hand to check the completeness of the spectrum of the hamiltonian and on the other hand the knowledge of the numerical solutions are necessary for the computation of correlation functions , form factors @xcite and other physical quantities of the model .",
    "although , the _ string hypothesis _ gives satisfactory results in the thermodynamic limit and counts the total number of states correctly in the general case , it has many drawbacks and there have been found some exceptions to it .",
    "for example , if the _ string hypothesis _ is valid in all respects then for a large length chain the imaginary part of the rapidities of @xmath9-string should converges to @xmath10 .",
    "however it has been shown in @xcite that some of the @xmath9-string rapidities @xmath11 , behave as @xmath12 , @xmath13 for large length @xmath14 spin chains .",
    "even , there are some @xmath9-strings which for large @xmath14 and large bethe quantum numbers deform back to two real rapidities @xcite , which is observed numerically . despite these drawbacks ,",
    "the _ string hypothesis _ has been very helpful in numerical analysis in the iteration method to obtain good initial guess for the finite length chains .",
    "exploiting the _ string hypothesis _ and taking into account the deformations , the complete string solutions for @xmath15 and @xmath16 length isotropic spin-@xmath0 heisenberg chains are obtained in @xcite . string solutions up to @xmath17",
    "have been obtained in @xcite and its supplement by making use of the homotopy continuation method to show that there are too many solutions of the bethe ansatz equations and only some of them , which obey the self - conjugacy condition , are the physical solutions of the heisenberg model . here",
    "we remark that we call a solution of the bethe ansatz equations _",
    "physical _ if it leads to an eigenvector of the hamiltonian .    usually , a set of solutions to the bethe ansatz equations consists of strings of different lengths . as mentioned above , one key constraint to the solutions of the bethe ansatz equations",
    "is that they are self - conjugate @xcite . while implementing this constraint in the _ string hypothesis _",
    "it is usually assumed that self - conjugacy is to be satisfied within a string @xcite , a condition , motivated by the observation of the short length spin chains , is too restrictive to be valid for all solutions of higher - length spin chains .",
    "we therefore relax the imposition of the self - conjugacy criterion to the whole set of rapidities not necessarily within a string , making the strings in a solution individually not self - conjugate .",
    "we show that our self - conjugacy criterion allows us to obtain some solutions which are not fitted within the standard deformed string picture , which is one of our motivations in this work . for even - length chains ,",
    "up to @xmath16 the string solutions , although deformed , still do obey the string structure and the restrictive self - conjugacy condition .",
    "first breakdown of the string structure for the physical solutions of even - length chains occurs in @xmath1 , as some of the strings become non self - conjugate and therefore need the most relaxed self - conjugacy condition .",
    "we discuss this feature of the string solutions here with an example of @xmath1 .",
    "although numerical solutions for @xmath1 is obtained in @xcite using the homotopy continuation method we here obtained the solutions by the iteration method using mathematica and exploiting the _ string hypothesis_. here we remark that some different types of solutions of the bethe ansatz equations in the anisotropic heisenberg models are studied in @xcite .    moreover ,",
    "recently a lot of works on the physical singular solutions have been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "the singular solutions as we know are an essential component of the spectrum and need a proper regularization scheme to derive the correct physical states and the eigenvalues .",
    "it is also possible to map these solutions and even the regular solutions to a type of combinatorial objects known as rigged configurations @xcite .",
    "based on the symmetry of the singular solutions for even - length chains we classify the solutions in different categories , which allow us to simplify the bethe ansatz equations significantly up to @xmath7 down - spins .",
    "studying the algebraic aspects of polynomials we estimate the number of singular solutions present at most for even - length spin chains up to @xmath7 down - spins .",
    "we also study the aspect of mapping of the bethe states to rigged configurations for singular solutions as well as solutions with non self - conjugate strings .",
    "our study enables us to identify all the physical singular solutions present in the @xmath1 case and map them to rigged configurations .",
    "it also simplifies the bethe ansatz equations for the singular solutions significantly up to @xmath7 down - spins with even @xmath14 so that the physical singular solutions and their total number are obtained systematically .",
    "we organize this paper in the following fashion : in the next section , we briefly present the isotropic spin-@xmath0 chain and its solutions in terms of the algebraic bethe ansatz method . in section iii , we discuss the non self - conjugate strings and explain them with the example of @xmath1 . in section iv , we discuss the singular solutions , their classification and give an estimate of the number singular solutions . in section v , we discuss rigged configurations and their correspondence with @xmath1 case for non self - conjugate string solutions and singular string solutions and finally we conclude .",
    "the hamiltonian of a spin-@xmath0 chain with length @xmath14 under the periodic boundary conditions is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the coupling constant and @xmath20 the spin at position @xmath21 and in @xmath22-direction .",
    "in the algebraic bethe ansatz formulation one can construct a bethe state in the case of @xmath23 down spin sector as @xmath24 with all up spins by acting the @xmath25 matrix . to obtain the @xmath25 matrix",
    "we need the lax operator @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the pauli spin-@xmath0 matrixes .",
    "each element of this matrix acts nontrivially on the @xmath28-th lattice site of the heisenberg model .",
    "one can get @xmath25 from the monodromy matrix @xmath29 the bethe state ( [ vec ] ) can also be written in a very useful form as @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 are elements of the permutation group @xmath32 of the @xmath23 numbers and @xmath33 is the heaviside step function @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 .    when the rapidities @xmath38 satisfy the well known bethe ansatz equations @xmath39 then the bethe state given by eq . ( [ vec ] ) ( and ( [ vec1 ] ) ) becomes the highest - weight bethe eigenstate .",
    "we also call the solutions of ( [ bethe ] ) the bethe roots . the eigenvalue of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) for the @xmath23 down - spin configuration is then given by @xmath40 a convenient way to deal with the bethe ansatz equations is to take the logarithm of eq .",
    "( [ bethe ] ) @xmath41 where the bethe quantum numbers , @xmath42 , take integral or half integral values , depending on whether @xmath43 is odd or even , respectively .",
    "however , since @xmath44 are repetitive in a given state , it is not useful for counting the number of states of the model in concern .",
    "but , it is possible to obtain non - repetitive quantum numbers with the help of the _ string hypothesis _ , which says that the rapidities for @xmath23 down - spins are arranged in a set of strings as @xmath45 where the string center @xmath46 is real , @xmath22 is the length of the string , @xmath47 accounts for the number of the @xmath22-strings and @xmath48 are the string deviations . in the limit @xmath49 , the bethe ansatz equations ( [ bethe ] )",
    "reduce to @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of @xmath52-strings present in the @xmath23 down - spin state and @xmath53 is the length of the largest string such that @xmath54 .",

    "one of the important ingredients for an effective iteration method is to start the numerical procedure with a very good initial guess . in case of the bethe equations ( [ bethe ] )",
    "it can be found by solving the takahashi equations ( [ betheta ] ) .",
    "one then needs to find the deviations @xmath48 of the string to obtain the actual roots . in the _ string hypothesis _",
    "these deviations are supposed to be purely imaginary and decrease exponentially with respect to @xmath14 . in finite - size spin chains",
    ", however , there are deviations of the string center , which leads to the form @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are real .",
    "since the bethe roots are self - conjugate there should be a corresponding restriction on the deviations .",
    "one choice is to consider self - conjugacy within a string of length @xmath22 , which translates to @xmath87 .",
    "a consequence of this picture is that the central rapidity of an odd - length string is always real and there is as such no relation between different strings in an eigenstate . for @xmath15 and @xmath16 we can recover all the string solutions from this consideration of string picture and it is therefore sufficient to restrict the self - conjugacy condition within a string .",
    "however , as we increase the length @xmath14 of the spin chain it is not possible to recover all the string solutions since the above self - conjugacy condition is too restrictive if we assume that deviations are small .",
    "note that in the _ string hypothesis _",
    "it is crucial to construct the strings in such a way that the deviations ( [ stringdev ] ) are small enough so that the @xmath49 limit leads to an approximate solution of the bethe ansatz equations , which satisfies the takahashi equations ( [ betheta ] ) and gives the takahashi quantum numbers ( [ takahashi ] ) .",
    "one therefore needs to impose the self - conjugacy condition on the whole set of strings \\{@xmath88 } = \\{@xmath89 } as mentioned in introduction . keeping the deviations small and relaxing the self - conjugacy to the whole set of strings ,",
    "we obtain some solutions , which are not self - conjugate , we call such solutions _ non self - conjugate string _ solutions .    to clarify the point with concrete examples let us consider a state of @xmath4 down - spins in a @xmath1 spin chain , with two 1-strings ( @xmath90 ) and one 3-string ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "if we consider the self - conjugacy condition only within each string then the bethe roots can be parametrized as @xmath92 where @xmath93 are real parameters which we have to evaluate numerically .",
    "we put curly brackets to separate different strings . all the physical solutions for @xmath94",
    "though fall in this category except two solutions in which case the roots can be parametrized as @xmath95 where @xmath96 are real parameters . in table",
    "i two such solutions of this kind are shown where one of the two 1-strings becomes complex conjugate to the central rapidity of the three string and therefore the 1-string and the 3-string become non self - conjugate individually but remains self - conjugate when considered collectively .",
    "in all the tables @xmath57 represent the takahashi quantum numbers for the @xmath97-strings .",
    "another example is present in the @xmath6 down spin sector , with one 1-string ( @xmath98 ) , one 2-string ( @xmath99 ) and one 3-string ( @xmath91 ) . again",
    "if we consider self - conjugacy for each string then the bethe roots can be parametrized as @xmath100 where @xmath101 are real parameters .",
    "all the solutions fall in this category except the three solutions which follow @xmath102 where @xmath103 are real parameters . we can still use ( [ 5downspin1 ] ) and ( [ 6downspin1 ] ) to get a relation between the bethe quantum numbers @xmath104 and the takahashi quantum numbers @xmath105 by first simply taking @xmath106 limit in the expressions of the two rapidities @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we note that in the @xmath106 limit the two rapidities do not become equal to each other , rather they go to two distinct rapidities , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "then ( [ 5downspin1 ] ) and ( [ 6downspin1 ] ) reduces to the standard string roots of ( [ 5downspin ] ) and ( [ 6downspin ] ) respectively , which allows us to obtain the takahashi quantum numbers in terms of the bethe quantum numbers . in table",

    ".    given a partition @xmath222 and a set of corresponding bethe states it is now our task to assign a rigged configuration @xmath233 to a bethe root .",
    "one way to assign this is to compare between the riggings @xmath19 and the real part of the rapidities of bethe roots and assign higher value of the real part of the roots to higher value of the riggings as adopted in @xcite . to get a mapping based on the comparison with the rapidity we have to then actually solve the rapidities numerically .",
    "we instead considered a comparison between the set of riggings of @xmath52-length strings @xmath234 in a form of the lexicographical order and the set of takahashi quantum numbers of the same @xmath52-length strings @xmath235 in a form of the inverse lexicographical order .",
    "the comparison starts from the largest length strings to the lowest length strings in descending order .",
    "we assign larger riggings to larger takahashi quantum numbers in the order specified in the above and obtain a bijection between the bethe states and the rigged configurations . on the right hand side of each row of the tables",
    "i to xiv we have shown the corresponding rigged configurations for @xmath1 spin-@xmath0 chain .    to understand the mapping ,",
    "let us consider all solutions of the form of one @xmath9-string and two @xmath160-strings in @xmath236 .",
    "since the largest string in this example is one @xmath9-string , we first compare the takahashi quantum numbers of the two string @xmath237 with the riggings of the @xmath9-string @xmath238 from the left to the right .",
    "then we compare @xmath239 pairs of the takahashi quantum numbers for two @xmath160-strings , @xmath240 @xmath241 @xmath242 , with @xmath239 pairs of riggings of the two @xmath160-strings , @xmath243 @xmath244 from the left to the right .",
    "four such explicit correspondences have been given in table v. this is just one example , the mapping for all solutions of the @xmath245 spin chain will be reported elsewhere .",
    ".singular solutions for @xmath246 , @xmath6 [ cols=\"<,>,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have observed that in the isotropic spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model there are some string solutions which do not fall in the standard category of string solutions .",
    "these are physical solutions of the bethe ansatz equations where the central rapidity of some of the odd length strings in a given bethe state becomes complex contrary to the standard knowledge where the central rapidity of an odd - length string is considered to be real even in the deformed strings",
    ". some of the individual strings in a bethe state in such scenario are no longer self - conjugate , but collectively all the strings in the bethe state remain self - conjugate .",
    "this behavior starts from @xmath1 case , where we see that in a @xmath4 down spin sector the central rapidity of one of the two 1-strings and the central rapidity of a 3-string become complex conjugate to each other as shown in table i. in @xmath6 down spin sector with @xmath247 we also observed that the the central rapidity of an 1-string and the central rapidity of a 3-string become complex conjugate , which are shown in table ii . to obtain these types of solutions in the string picture",
    "we have used the newton- raphson method in mathematica and made use of the roots of takahashi string with some modifications as the initial guess for the input in the iteration method .",
    "the number of missing solutions in the deformed string picture for large @xmath14 is solely attributed to the collapse of pairs of strings in @xcite but as we observe in our analysis that the missing string solutions include not only the collapsing strings but also the non self - conjugate strings .    note that if one allows large deviations then the non self - conjugate strings , which we investigated in this paper , can always be arranged in such a way that the individual strings become self - conjugate .",
    "for example , any complex solution can be written in terms of combination of @xmath160-strings and @xmath9-strings , because complex rapidities always appear in complex conjugate pairs . in some cases",
    ", it is even possible to arrange the non self - conjugate string solutions in terms of self - conjugate strings involving larger than @xmath9-strings .",
    "however we instead opted for non self - conjugate string arrangement for the following reason : we constructed all the solutions as small deformations of the pure string solutions so that we can use the roots of the pure string solutions as an initial guess in the iteration process .",
    "if we introduce the pure string solutions as the initial guess , it is relatively easy to find out the small deviations in the iteration method as far as we have investigated . in the _ string hypothesis _ in the limit that the small deviations vanish , we obtain the takahashi quantum numbers , which have unique one - to - one correspondence with the not collapsing string solutions . in our examples of non self - conjugate string solutions mentioned in tables",
    "i and ii we emphasize this unique correspondence of the takahashi quantum numbers ( shown in the third column from the left ) to the non self - conjugate string solutions . just to clarify the point ,",
    "let us consider the first solution of table i , which is composed of one real @xmath160-string ( @xmath248 ) , one complex @xmath160-string ( @xmath249 ) and one @xmath225-string ( @xmath250 ) with a complex center .",
    "once we take the @xmath49 limit , we recover the takahashi quantum numbers associated with them , which are also derived directly by making use of eq .",
    "( [ takahashi ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if one arranges the above mentioned solution in the form of one @xmath160-string ( @xmath248 ) , and two @xmath9-strings ( @xmath251 ) and ( @xmath252 ) with large deviations , then the self - conjugacy is restored for each individual string , while there is no set of takahashi quantum numbers available for this arrangement in the string picture . here we recall that without takahashi quantum numbers we do not have any good initial guess in the iteration method of finding the solutions to the bethe ansatz equations , while the solution of the takahashi equations for a given set of takahashi quantum numbers leads to a good initial guess as far as we studied .",
    "the same is true if one arranges the above solution in the form of one @xmath160-string ( @xmath248 ) and one @xmath253-string ( @xmath254 ) with large deviations .",
    "similarly , every non self - conjugate solution we showed in this paper is given in the unique arrangement that is mapped to a set of the takahashi quantum numbers .",
    "considering the sum of the rapidities of a singular bethe state to be zero for even - length spin chains we have classified the singular roots and obtained a general form of the rapidities .",
    "for @xmath255 it enables us to reduce the bethe ansatz equations to a polynomial equation of one variable , which can be easily handled numerically for large even @xmath14 of the spin chain .",
    "we showed that for @xmath3 and @xmath4 there are at most @xmath256 singular solutions for @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath257 it is possible to reduce the bethe ansatz equations to a system of polynomial equations of two variables . making use of the algebraic method we showed that the number of singular solutions in such cases are at most @xmath258 . for generic values of",
    "even @xmath14 and even @xmath23 we can not give the number of singular solutions present but we can predict a form of the formula ( [ singm ] ) for the number of singular solutions with coefficients yet to be determined .",
    "our analysis on the number of singular solutions agrees with the value @xmath259 for even @xmath23 and @xmath216 , which is one of the conjecture in @xcite .",
    "however , we showed with examples that the number of singular solutions for even-@xmath23 and @xmath216 are the same at least up to @xmath6 , which disagrees with the conjecture @xmath260(c ) of @xcite , and there is no forbidden rigging in connection with the singular solutions in the @xmath1 spin chain .",
    "the eigenvalues for the singular states have been obtained by making use of the regularization scheme of @xcite .",
    "the detail derivation of the eigenvalues and the eigenstates for the singular solutions has been given in @xcite , where we made use of the same regularization scheme .",
