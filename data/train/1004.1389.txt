    "in recent experimental work @xcite , @xcite , p. eckle et al . have investigated the ionization of helium atoms by highly intense elliptically polarized infrared laser pulses of short duration .",
    "one of the purposes of their work has been to perform an ( indirect ) measurement of the _ tunneling delay time _ in strong - field ionization of helium atoms .",
    "the experimental parameters in their work have been chosen as follows : the pulse duration , @xmath5 , is around @xmath6 ; the peak intensity , @xmath7 , is between @xmath8 and @xmath9 watts per square centimeter , and the center wave - length is around @xmath10 .",
    "the ionization potential , @xmath11 , of a helium atom in its groundstate is known to be @xmath12 .",
    "these parameter values yield a _",
    "keldysh parameter _ , @xmath13 , for circularly polarized light ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",

    "however , due to the high intensity of the pulse , the theoretical analysis of the ionization process is _ intrinsically non - perturbative _ in the coupling of the electrons to the electromagnetic field .",
    "this is the regime we study in this paper .    for the values of @xmath13 between @xmath14 and @xmath15 realized in the experiments described in @xcite , @xcite , reliable analytical calculations of the ionization process appear to be very difficult to come by , and it is advisable to perform numerical studies ; see @xcite .",
    "we find , however , that our analytical results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental findings in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one key point of these findings is that the ionization process of a helium atom by a short , intense near - infrared laser pulse is essentially instantaneous , in contrast to theoretical predictions based on an approximate theoretical picture taken from @xcite , @xcite : experimentally , an upper bound on the time it takes to ionize a helium atom ( with experimental parameters chosen as discussed above ) appears to lie between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , while a theoretical prediction relying on @xcite , @xcite yields an ionization ( or  barrier traversal \" ) time of @xmath22 .",
    "obviously there is a problem with either the interpretation of the experimental findings in terms of an  ionization time \" or with the approximate theory of the ionization process based on @xcite , @xcite ; but most likely with both .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to provide a qualitative theoretical interpretation of the data gathered in the experiments described in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we start with a brief sketch of the picture on which the theoretical interpretation of the experimental results is based that the authors of @xcite have advocated implicitly .",
    "we then describe our own approach and state our main results .    without harm",
    ", we may simplify our discussion by considering the ionization of hydrogen atoms or helium@xmath23 ions by elliptically polarized laser pulses .",
    "the direction of propagation of the pulses through a very dilute , cold gas of atoms or ions is chosen to be our @xmath24-axis .",
    "the electric and magnetic field of the pulse are then parallel to the @xmath25 plane .",
    "if @xmath26 denotes the peak electric field of the pulse at the location of an atom or ion and @xmath5 denotes the duration of the pulse then the field of the pulse is assumed to be homogeneous over a region of the @xmath25 plane of large diameter , @xmath27 , as compared to @xmath28 , centered at the location of the atom or ion .",
    "note that @xmath28 has the dimension of length .",
    "this assumption partially justifies to use the dipole approximation .",
    "the hamiltonian generating the time evolution of the electron in the atom or ion then only depends on the electric field , @xmath29 , at the location of the atomic ( or ionic ) nucleus ; ( @xmath30 denotes time ) .",
    "the vector @xmath29 can be chosen to have the form @xmath31 , \\epsilon \\sin\\left[\\omega \\left(t-\\frac{t}{2}\\right)\\right ] , 0\\right)\\,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a smooth envelope function with support in the interval @xmath33 $ ] , @xmath34 is the angular frequency of the pulse ( with @xmath35 ) , and @xmath36 is a parameter describing the elliptical polarization of the pulse . to be concrete ,",
    "we choose @xmath37 to be non - negative , symmetric - decreasing about @xmath38 , with a maximum , @xmath39 , at @xmath38 .",
    "apparently , the pulse arrives at the location of the nucleus at time @xmath40 and lasts until time @xmath41 .",
    "an important quantity is the vector potential @xmath42 clearly , @xmath43 , for @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , for @xmath46 . for our choice of the envelope function @xmath37 , @xmath47",
    "where the constant depends on @xmath48 and on @xmath37 ; it tends to @xmath49 rapidly , as @xmath50 , i.e. , in the ultraviolet . in this regime ,",
    "the keldysh parameter @xmath13 becomes very large , and the analysis presented in our paper is not applicable .",
    "it does , however , apply to the situation where @xmath51 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) , becomes _ large _ , meaning that @xmath13 becomes _",

    "moreover , @xmath56 ( with a rate that will be estimated ) , and @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "these theoretical results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental findings described in @xcite , @xcite . in the experiments , the motion of the _ ions _ after ionization is measured . however , by momentum conservation , such measurements also determine the motion of the electron .    in @xcite , data compatible with eqs .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) are interpreted as saying that the ionization process is nearly instantaneous .",
    "this interpretation is based , implicitly , on arguments that rely on the  ritz hamiltonian \" for the motion of the electron : @xmath59 @xmath60 is the laplacian , @xmath61 is the charge of the nucleus , and @xmath29 is the electric field of the laser pulse at the location of the nucleus , ( see eq .",
