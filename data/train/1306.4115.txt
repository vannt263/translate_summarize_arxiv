    "boundary value problems for second order elliptic equations have a long history .",
    "the breakthroughs of dahlberg @xcite for the laplace equation on lipschitz domains and the boundedness of the corresponding layer potentials by coifman , mcintosh and meyer @xcite opened the door to a thorough study of such problems , generalizing domains or operators . by flattening the boundary ,",
    "one instead looks at equations with measurable coefficients and considers two types of domains , either the upper - half space as a prototype for unbounded domains or the unit ball as a prototype for a bounded domain .",
    "there one can study boundary value problems with different types of data spaces .",
    "all of this is well explained in the book by kenig @xcite .",
    "solving these boundary value problems can be a difficult task ; there is no comprehensive nor unified treatment of this issue at this time .",
    "let us just mention that the solution of the kato conjecture @xcite and its developments gave rise to new estimates and new methods so that progress in the area is rather impressive as of now .",
    "the purpose of this article is to study extrapolation of boundary value problems for elliptic systems in divergence form on the upper half - space @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "extrapolation means that , assuming the problem can be solved for some space @xmath3 of data , one can push the solvability range to some other spaces . for regularity and neumann problems",
    ", @xmath3 is an @xmath4 space , @xmath5 and one extrapolates to @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 data for some range of @xmath9 below 1 . for dirichlet problems ,",
    "one starts from @xmath10 for some @xmath11 and extrapolates to @xmath6 for @xmath12 , bmo and hlder spaces up to some exponent .",
    "in fact , one can see the dirichlet problem as a regularity problem in spaces of data with regularity exponent -1 .",
    "one can also formulate neumann problems in spaces of data with regularity -1 .",
    "we do not treat here the openness property of extrapolation , that is that solvability at one space of data can be perturbed to nearby spaces in the given scale .",
    "this will be treated in @xcite using further developments .",
    "these types of extrapolation results are not new , at least for equations , starting from the seminal works of @xcite for the laplace equation on lipschitz domains and @xcite for real symmetric equations .",
    "further contributions are in @xcite for the laplace equation looking at @xmath8 data for @xmath13 , in @xcite in the context of the laplace equation on smooth domains of riemannian manifolds and in @xcite for real equations on bounded lipschitz domains .",
    "see also some comments in @xcite outlining a strategy using kalton - mitrea extrapolation @xcite when layer potentials associated to the operators are invertible .",
    "of course , we are just mentioning the works related to extrapolation in this subject and not the numerous ones on solvability for second order elliptic operators under various assumptions . in some sense",
    ", we are after a sort of extrapolation reminiscent to the caldern and zygmund extrapolation for singular integrals because the operators under considerations can be thought of as generalized singular integrals .    to do so",
    ", we introduce a new method which allows to treat each boundary value problem independently of the other ones and to consider systems and not just equations , assuming de giorgi - nash type local hlder regularity , in the interior and for reflections across the boundary . for the neumann problem , this is completely new : in @xcite , which is the closest antecedent to our results here , extrapolation of solvability for the neumann problem was linked to that of the regularity problem .",
    "our method will clarify the regularity - dirichlet duality principle for solvability obtained in @xcite , extend its range to @xmath0 and we will also formulate and use a new duality principle for neumann problems . also our exponents are explicitly determined by the ones in the de giorgi conditions .",
    "our strategy can be summarized as follows : try to distinguish as much as possible interior and boundary estimates so as to use _ a priori _ estimates most of the time .",
    "to do so , we have to reverse the order in which we use some tools compared to other works .",
    "our divergence operators will be precisely defined in section [ sec : general ] and ellipticity will be taken in the sense of some grding inequality .",
    "the boundary value problems are treated for operators whose coefficients do not depend on @xmath14 , the transverse variable to the boundary , but some results do not need this . for the purpose of the introduction , it is best to assume @xmath14-independence .",
    "we shall rely on energy solutions .",
    "indeed , regularity and neumann problems are always well - posed ( modulo constants ) in the energy class without any further information .",
    "we deviate here from the treatment done in @xcite or @xcite by using the `` natural '' energy space given by the dirichlet integral @xmath15 . even in the unbounded situation of the upper half - space ,",
    "things turn out to work rather well with this space .",
    "solvability of regularity and neumann problems means here that energy solutions satisfy the required inequality respectively : control of @xmath16 , the @xmath6 norm of ( a modified ) non - tangential maximal function of @xmath17 , by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the tangential gradient at the boundary or by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the conormal derivative at the boundary .",
    "for the boundary estimates , the norm @xmath22 denotes an @xmath6 norm if @xmath23 and a hardy @xmath8 norm if @xmath24 .",
    "one of the main results here is the following . assuming interior de giorgi type conditions",
    ", there is an _ a priori _ equivalence between @xmath16 and the sum @xmath25 in a range @xmath26 for energy solutions ( and for other types of solutions as well ) with @xmath27 specified by our assumptions .. in fact , it can be shown to hold without the de giorgi condition , at the expense of some further work which shall be presented in @xcite . ] for @xmath28 , this was one of the key result in @xcite .",
    "the bound from below holds for any weak solution : it was known in the range @xmath29 from @xcite and has been proved recently in a range @xmath30 in @xcite .",
    "the bound from above has been addressed in the range @xmath31 in @xcite for a class of solutions @xmath32 which can be represented by the layer potentials built in @xcite using green s representation formula @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively the single and double layer potentials associated to @xmath36 on @xmath37 .",
    "we shall prove ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) that the bound from above holds in the range @xmath26 for any solution in the energy class and other classes .",
    "here , we use the newly discovered relation by a. rosn @xcite between the layer potentials and the first order formalism of @xcite , which gives @xmath38 boundedness of the double layer potential and @xmath39 boundedness of the single layer potential in full generality .",
    "it allows to use instead the differentiated form of which actually comes before in the analysis ( and one does not care about the constant of integration at this stage ) @xmath40 and one only needs to have two _ a priori _",
    "bounds for the layer potentials .",
    "the first one is @xmath41 that we obtain in the range @xmath42 ( again , recall that boundary norms are @xmath8 norms when @xmath24 ) .",
    "we note this was proved for @xmath31 for complex equations and @xmath43 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.9 ) and there is an interesting comment to make as an illustration of reversing the order in which we use tools .",
    "the argument there uses an estimate for what is called @xmath44-harmonic conjugates ( such an estimate is a one - sided rellich inequality in disguise ( see below ) ) and seems therefore to be limited to @xmath23 .",
    "instead , our argument for this inequality does not require such an estimate ; it only uses atomic theory and interpolation .",
    "this is made possible because we use and not .",
    "the other needed _ a priori _ bound @xmath45 in the range @xmath46 was known from @xcite at least in the equation case and @xmath43 . with this in hand ,",
    "solvability for a given @xmath9 in this range is equivalent to a boundary estimate of rellich type ( again for energy solutions ) which is @xmath47 for the regularity problem and @xmath48 for the neumann problem .",
    "the outcome of this is that in order to extrapolate solvability , it suffices to extrapolate a one - sided rellich inequality .",
    "this step , therefore , completely happens at the boundary .",
    "basically , in the spirit of the ideas in @xcite and @xcite , we can use hardy space atomic theory on the boundary and interpolation .",
    "but the difference is that we only have to prove or with given data a 2-atom ( section [ sec : rellichp<1 ] ) and we do this by showing that the missing data is a molecule ( section [ sec : extra ] ) without going back to non - tangential maximal estimates . aside from some pointwise estimates on solutions shown in section [ sec :",
    "decay ] relying on some form of boundary regularity , this step uses , of course , the initial solvability assumption even to get the molecular decay .",
    "note also that harmonic measure techniques are forbidden to us as we work with systems .",
    "the way it works is that we use in fact the dual formulation of the inequalities or when @xmath23 .",
    "we were therefore led to investigate this further ( section [ sec : dualp>1 ] ) .",
    "the dual of is an inequality akin to the one needed to solve the adjoint dirichlet problem in @xmath49 .",
    "the dual formulation of is new .",
    "what is also new is that these dual formulations do not require any assumption on the operator , not even @xmath14-independence , but the ellipticity , because we use duality brackets and not integrals .",
    "we also use the integrated layer potential representation for solutions of the dual system : the de giorgi condition comes into play to show that holds whenever @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 .    as for the dirichlet problem , we can basically treat it with the duality principle that regularity solvability with @xmath6 data is equivalent to dirichlet solvability for @xmath49 data of the dual system . while the regularity to dirichlet direction has been known since @xcite for real symmetric equations , the converse is fairly recent for general systems ( some partial results for real symmetric equations in lipschitz domains are in @xcite ) and requires to incorporate square functions in the formulation of the dirichlet problem .",
    "this was proved in full generality in @xcite for @xmath28 and then in @xcite for equations and @xmath43 and @xmath53 ( both articles allow some @xmath14dependence as well ) .",
    "we reprove and strengthen it even with the hypotheses there and also extend it to @xmath54 for regularity vs bmo ( or vmo ) for dirichlet .",
    "the dirichlet problem is stated only with a square function estimate and no non - tangential maximal control which in fact comes as _ a priori _ information .",
    "we shall use in this part a recent result obtained by one of us together with s. stahlhut @xcite .",
    "we only discuss the case of the upper half - space , but of course , the analogous results hold for systems in the lower half - space . also by change of variable , one can treat the case of special lipschitz domains with operators that do not depend on the vertical variable .",
    "the principal example is the laplacian for which extrapolation results were proved in the seminal paper @xcite and pursued in @xcite .",
    "we also mention that the same strategy can certainly be developed in the unit ball with radially independent coefficients instead , that is , the framework of @xcite , using the first order formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "this would require writing out some details on layer potentials .",
    "we leave this to further developments .",
    "all our estimates in this article depend only on ellipticity constants @xmath55 and the largest @xmath56 in the specified ellipticity inequality , and on the constants in the de giorgi condition when assumed .",

    "local square integrability is of particular help ( in fact , it suffices to even assume @xmath32 to be a distribution as @xmath32 can then be identified with an @xmath102 function ) , even if the `` norm '' is defined modulo constant .",
    "indeed , the proof of lemma 3.1 in @xcite shows that @xmath99 imbeds into @xmath103 , where @xmath104 stands for the space of continuous functions on @xmath59 , ( up to identification of measurable functions on null sets ) and that the restriction to @xmath1 of @xmath105 is dense in @xmath99 . in particular",
