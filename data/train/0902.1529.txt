    "the fundamental object in general relativity is the _ metric _ , which encodes the shape of the spacetime .",
    "a metric is a symmetric , bilinear form which defines distances on a manifold .",
    "for example , we can express pythagoras theorem in a euclidean three - dimensional space , @xmath0 as a matrix product over the identity matrix @xmath1 , @xmath2 therefore the identity matrix @xmath3 can be identified as the metric for the euclidean space : if we wish to describe a non - euclidean manifold , we replace @xmath4 with a more complicated matrix @xmath5 , which in general can depend on the coordinates @xmath6 . for an arbitrary path through the space ,",
    "we express distances on the manifold in differential form , @xmath7 the distance along any path in the spacetime , or _ world line _ , is then given by integrating @xmath8 along that path .",
    "a familiar example of a non - euclidean space frequently used in physics is the minkowski space describing spacetime in special relativity .",
    "distances along a world line in minkowski space are measured by the _ proper time _ , which is the time as measured by an observer traveling on that world line .",
    "the proper time @xmath9 along a world line is given by the relation @xmath10 where we take the speed of light @xmath11 .",
    "we express four - vectors as @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the euclidean distance along a spatial interval .",
    "the metric @xmath14 for minkowski space is given by @xmath15 anything traveling the speed of light has velocity @xmath16 .",
    "photons therefore always travel along world lines of zero proper time , @xmath17 , called _",
    "null geodesics_. massive particles travel along world lines with real proper time , @xmath18 , called _",
    "timelike geodesics_. causally disconnected regions of spacetime are separated by _",
    "intervals , with @xmath19 .",
    "the set of all null geodesics passing through a given point ( or _ event _ ) in spacetime is called the _ light cone _ ( fig . [",
    "fig : minkowskilightcones ] ) the interior of the light cone , consisting of all null and timelike geodesics , defines the region of spacetime causally related to that event .    ,",
    "and the future light cone defines the causal future of @xmath20.,width=432 ]      the minkowski metric @xmath14 of special relativity describes a euclidean spacetime which is static , empty , and infinite in space and time .",
    "the addition of gravity to the picture requires general relativity , which describes gravitational fields as curvature in the spacetime .",
    "the fundamental object in general relativity is the metric @xmath21 , which describes the shape of the spacetime and in general depends on the spacetime coordinate @xmath22 . as in minkowski",
    "space , lengths in curved spacetime are measured by the proper time @xmath9 , with the proper time along a world line determined by the metric @xmath23 as in special relativity , photons travel along null geodesics , with @xmath24 , and massive particles travel along timelike geodesics , with @xmath18 .",
    "however , unlike special relativity , null geodesics need not always be @xmath25 lines defining light cones , but can be curved by gravity .    in general relativity ,",
    "the distribution of mass / energy in the spacetime determines the shape of the metric , and the metric in turn determines the evolution of the mass / energy .",
    "electromagnetism provides a convenient analogy : in electromagnetism , the distribution of charges and currents determines the electromagnetic field , and the electromagnetic field in turn determines the evolution of the charges and currents .",
    "given a current four - vector @xmath26 , maxwell s equations are a set of linear , first - order partial differential equations that allow us to calculate the resulting electromagnetic field @xmath27 here we have explicitly included the speed of light @xmath28 to highlight its role as an electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "we also adopt the typical summation convention for relativity : repeated indices are implicitly summed over . in general relativity",
    ", we describe the distribution of mass / energy in a covariant way by specifying a symmetric rank-2 _ stress - energy _",
    "tensor @xmath29 , which acts as a source for the gravitational field similar to the way the current four - vector @xmath26 sources electromagnetism .",
    "the analog of maxwell s equations is the einstein field equation , which can be written in the deceptively simple form @xmath30 where the coupling constant is newton s gravitational constant @xmath31 .",
    "the tensor @xmath32 , called the einstein tensor , is a symmetric @xmath33 tensor consisting of the metric @xmath34 and its first and second derivatives .",
    "the einstein field equation therefore represents a set of ten coupled , nonlinear , second - order partial differential equations of ten free functions , which are the elements of the metric tensor @xmath35 .",
    "however , only six of these equations are actually indpendent , leaving four degrees of freedom .",
    "the physics of gravity is independent of coordinate system , and the additional degrees of freedom correspond to a choice of a coordinate system , or _",
    "gauge _ on the four - dimensional space .",
    "gravity is _ much _ more complicated than electromagnetism ! as with any intractably complicated problem , we simplify the job by introducing a symmetry .",
    "in general relativity there are a number of symmetries which allow either exact or perturbative solution to the einstein field equations :    * vacuum : @xmath36 .",
    "if we evaluate the einstein field equations for small perturbations about an empty minkowski space , we find that they reduce at lowest order to a wave equation , and therefore general relativity predicts the existence of gravity waves . *",
    "spherical symmetry .",
    "if we assume a spherically symmetric spacetime ( also empty of matter , @xmath36 ) the einstein field equation can be solved exactly , resulting in the schwarzschild solution for black holes . * homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "if we assume that the stress - energy is distributed in a fashion which is homogeneous and isotropic , this is called a _ friedmann - robertson - walker _ ( frw ) space , and is the case of interest for cosmology .",
    "since the homogeneity and isotropy remove all spatial dependence , the einstein field equations reduce from a set of partial differential equations to a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations in time . for particular types of homogeneous , isotropic matter , these equations can be solved exactly , and perturbations about those exact solutions can be handled self - consistently .    continuing",
    "the analogy with electromagnetism , the equivalent of charge conservation , @xmath37 in general relativity is stress - energy conservation @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents a covariant derivative , which is a generalization of the partial derivative to a curved manifold .",
    "we will also denote covariant derivatives with a semicolon , for example @xmath40 .",
    "likewise , simple partial derivatives are denoted with a comma , @xmath41 . as in the case of electromagnetism , where the charge conservation equation is not independent , but is instead a consequence of maxwell s equations , stress - energy conservation in general relativity is a consequence of the einstein field equations and does not independently constrain the solutions . in the next section",
    ", we discuss frw spaces and their application to cosmology in more detail .",
    "a _ homogeneous _ space is one which is translationally invariant , or the same at every point .",
    "an _ isotropic _",

    "the two are not the same : a space which is everywhere isotropic is necessarily homogeneous , but a space which is homogeneous is not necessarily isotropic .",
    "( consider , for example a space with a uniform electric field : it is translationally invariant but not rotationally invariant . )",
    "it is possible to show @xcite that the most general metric consistent with homogeneity and isotropy is obtained by multiplying a static spatial geometry with a time - dependent _ scale factor _",

    "the constant @xmath48 defines the curvature of the spacetime , with @xmath49 corresponding to flat ( euclidean ) spatial sections , and @xmath50 corresponding to positive and negative curvatures , respectively .",
    "a spacetime of this general form is called a _ friedmann - robertson - walker _ ( frw ) spacetime .",
    "likewise , the most general homogeneous , isotropic stress - energy is diagonal , with all of its spatial components identical , @xmath51 where we identify the energy density @xmath52 and the pressure @xmath53 from the continuity equation arising from stress - energy conservation , @xmath54    the einstein field equations then reduce to a set of two coupled , non - linear ordinary differential equations , @xmath55 the first is called the _ friedmann equation _ , and the second is called the _ raychaudhuri equation_. note that the equations for the evolution of the scale factor depend not only on the energy density @xmath52 , but also the pressure @xmath53 : pressure gravitates ! the continuity equation ( [ eq : continuity ] ) is _ not _ independent of the einstein field equations ( [ eq : generalfrw ] ) , but can be derived directly from the friedmann and raychaudhuri equations .",
    "the expansion rate @xmath56 is called the _ hubble parameter _",
    "@xmath57 : @xmath58 and has units of inverse time .",
    "a positive hubble parameter @xmath59 corresponds to an expanding universe , and a negative hubble parameter @xmath60 corresponds to a collapsing universe .",
    "( since our actual universe is expanding , we will specialize to that case . )",
    "minkowski space can be recovered by assuming a flat geometry @xmath49 , and no expansion , @xmath61 .",
    "the hubble parameter sets the fundamental scale of the spacetime , _",
    "i.e. _ a characteristic time is the _",
    "hubble time _",
    "@xmath62 , and likewise the _ hubble length _",
    "is @xmath63 .",
    "we will see later that the hubble time sets the scale for the age of the universe , and the hubble length sets the scale for the size of the observable universe .",
    "the coordinate system @xmath64 is called a _ comoving _ coordinate system , because observers with constant comoving coordinates are at rest relative to the expansion , _",
    "i.e. _ two observers with constant separation in comoving coordinates @xmath65 have a physical , or _",
    "proper _ , separation which increases in proportion to the scale factor @xmath66 an important kinematic effect of cosmological expansion is the phenomenon of _ cosmological redshift _ : we will see later that solutions to the wave equation in an frw space have constant wavelength in _ comoving _ coordinates , so that the proper wavelength of ( for example ) a photon increases in time in proportion to the scale factor @xmath67 for a photon emitted at time @xmath68 and detected at time @xmath69 , the redshift @xmath70 is defined by : @xmath71 ( here we introduce the convention used frequently in cosmology that a subscript @xmath72 refers to the _ current _ time , not an initial time . ) note that the cosmological redshift is _ not _ a doppler shift caused by the relative velocity of the source and detector , but is an expansion effect : the wavelength of a photon traveling through the spacetime increases because the underlying spacetime is expanding .",
    "another way to look at this is that a photon traveling through an frw spacetime loses momentum with time , @xmath73 by the equivalence principle , this momentum loss must apply to massive particles as well as photons : _ any _ particle moving in an expanding frw spacetime will lose momentum as @xmath74 . for massless particles like photons ,",
    "this is manifest as a redshift in the wavelength , but it means that a massive particle will asymptotically come to rest relative to the comoving coordinate system .",
    "thus , comoving coordinates represent a preferred reference frame reminiscent of aristotelian physics : any free body with a `` peculiar '' velocity relative to the comoving frame will eventually come to rest in that frame .",
    "there are three possibilities for the curvature of the universe : flat ( @xmath49 ) , positively curved ( @xmath75 ) , or negatively curved ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the current value of the hubble parameter is ( from the hubble space telescope key project @xcite ) , @xmath77 therefore , we can see from the friedmann equation ( [ eq : generalfrw ] ) that , given the expansion rate @xmath57 , the curvature is determined by the density : @xmath78 note that only the _ sign _ of @xmath48 is physically important , since any rescaling of @xmath48 is equivalent to a rescaling of the scale factor @xmath79 .",
    "we define the _ critical density _ as the density for which @xmath49 , corresponding to a geometrically flat universe , @xmath80 for @xmath81 , the universe is positively curved and _ closed _ , with finite volume , and for @xmath82 , the universe is negatively curved and _ open _ , with infinite volume .",
    "we express the ratio of the actual density @xmath52 to the critical density @xmath83 as the parameter @xmath84 : @xmath85 ( do not confuse the density parameter @xmath84 with the solid angle @xmath86 in eq .",

    ".cosmological density and curvature [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the density parameter @xmath84 is not in general constant in time , and we can re - write the friedmann equation as @xmath87 since the hubble parameter is proportional to the inverse time @xmath88 , we see that the time - dependence of @xmath84 is determined by the time dependence of the scale factor @xmath89 . in the next section",
    ", we tackle the problem of solving for @xmath89 .      in the previous section",
    ", we considered the form and kinematics of frw spaces , but not the _ dynamics _ , that is , how does the stress - energy of the universe determine the expansion history ?",
    "the answer to this question depends on what kind of matter dominates the cosmological stress - energy . in this section",
    ", we consider three basic types of cosmological stress - energy : matter , radiation , and vacuum .",
    "the simplest kind of cosmological stress - energy is generically referred to as _",
    "matter_. imagine a comoving box with sides of length @xmath90 . by",
    "_ comoving _ box , we mean a box whose corners are at rest in a comoving coordinate system , and whose proper dimension is therefore increasing proportional to the scale factor , @xmath91 . that is , the box is growing with the expansion of the universe .",
    "now imagine the box filled with @xmath92 particles of mass @xmath93 , also at rest in the comoving reference frame ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boxofmatter ] ) .                in units where @xmath11 , the relativistic energy density of such a system of particles is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the _ proper _ volume of the box , @xmath96 .",
    "since neither @xmath97 nor @xmath92 change with expansion , we have immediately that @xmath98 where @xmath90 is the comoving size of the box .",
    "so the proper energy density of massive particles at rest in a comoving volume evolves as the inverse cube of the scale factor .",
    "now imagine the same box filled with @xmath92 photons with frequency @xmath99 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boxofradiation ] ) .",
    "the energy per photon is @xmath100 , so that the energy density in the box is then @xmath101    as in the case of massive particles , the number density of photons in the box redshifts inversely with the proper volume of the box @xmath102 . but",
    "each photon also loses energy through cosmological redshift , @xmath103 ( [ eq : freqredshift ] ) , so that the total energy density in photons or other massless degrees of freedom , which we generically refer to as _ radiation _ , redshifts as @xmath104 note also that cosmological redshift immediately gives us a rule for the behavior of a black - body spectrum of radiation with temperature @xmath105 . since all photons redshift at exactly the same rate , a system with starts out as a black - body _ stays",
    "_ a black - body , with a temperature that decreases with expansion , @xmath106    the third type of stress - energy which is important in cosmology dates back to einstein s introduction of a `` cosmological constant '' to his field equations .",
    "if we take the stress - energy @xmath29 and add a term proportional to the metric , the identity @xmath107 means the stress - energy conservation equation ( [ eq : seconservation ] ) is unchanged : @xmath108 in our analogy with electromagnetism , this is like adding a constant to the electromagnetic potential , @xmath109 .",
    "the constant @xmath110 does not affect local dynamics in any way , but it does affect the cosmology . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluidstressenergy ] ) , stress - energy of the form @xmath111 corresponds to an equation of state @xmath112 the continuity equation ( [ eq : continuity ] ) then reduces to @xmath113 so that vacuum has a constant energy density , @xmath114 a cosmological constant is also frequently referred to as _ vacuum energy _ , since it is as if we are assigning an energy density to empty space . with this interpretation ,",
    "a comoving box full of vacuum contains a total amount of energy which _ grows _ with the expansion of the universe ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boxofvac ] ) .",
    "this highlights the curious property of general relativity that , while energy is conserved in a local sense , it is _ not _ conserved globally .",
    "we are creating energy out of nothing !",
    "it is straightforward to solve the einstein field equations for the three basic types of stress - energy .",
    "consider first a matter - dominated universe .",
    "we can write the time derivative of the energy density as : @xmath115 from the continuity equation ( [ eq : continuity ] ) , we have @xmath116 we then have that the pressure of matter vanishes , @xmath117 .",
    "the matter - dominated friedmann equation becomes @xmath118 in the case of a flat universe , @xmath49 , the solution is especially simple : @xmath119 similarly , for a radiation dominated universe , the continuity equation implies that @xmath120 again assuming a flat geometry , @xmath121 finally , solving the the friedmann equation for the vacuum case gives @xmath122 so that the universe expands exponentially quickly , with a time constant given by the hubble parameter @xmath123 such a spacetime is called _ de sitter space_.    note in particular that the energy density in radiation redshifts away more quickly than the energy density in matter , and vacuum energy does not redshift at all , so that a universe with a mix of radiation , matter and vacuum will be radiation - dominated at early times , matter - dominated at later times , and eventually vacuum - dominated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rhovsz ] ) .",
    ": at early time , radiation dominates , followed by matter , and finally the universe is dominated by vacuum energy.,width=432 ]    note also that for either matter- or radiation - domination , the universe is singular as @xmath124 : the universe has finite age ! since the scale factor vanishes at @xmath125 , and the density scales as an inverse power of @xmath79 , the initial singularity consists of infinite density . likewise , since temperature also scales inversely with @xmath79 , the initial singularity is also a point of infinite temperature .",
    "we therefore arrive at the standard hot big bang picture of the universe : a cosmological singularity at finite time in the past , followed by a hot , radiation - dominated expansion , during which the universe gradually cools as @xmath126 and the radiation dilutes , followed by a period of matter - dominated expansion during which galaxies and stars and planets form . finally ,",
    "if the vacuum energy is nonzero , it will inevitably dominate , and the universe will enter a state of exponential expansion .",
    "current evidence indicates that the real universe made a transition from matter - domination to vacuum - domination at a redshift of around @xmath127 , or about a billion years ago , so that the densities of the three types of matter today are of order @xmath128 in the next section , we discuss one important prediction of the hot big bang : the presence of a background of relic photons from the early universe , called the _ cosmic microwave background_.      the basic picture of an expanding , cooling universe leads to a number of startling predictions : the formation of nuclei and the resulting primordial abundances of elements , and the later formation of neutral atoms and the consequent presence of a cosmic background of photons , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite . a rough history of the universe can be given as a time line of increasing time and decreasing temperature @xcite :    * @xmath129 , @xmath125 : big bang .",

    "the epoch at which atoms form , when the universe was at an age of 300,000 years and at a temperature of around @xmath142 is oxymoronically referred to as `` recombination '' , despite the fact that electrons and nuclei had never before `` combined '' into atoms .",
    "the physics is simple : at a temperature of greater than about @xmath142 , the universe consisted of an ionized plasma of mostly protons , electrons , and photons , with a few helium nuclei and a tiny trace of lithium .",
    "the important characteristic of this plasma is that it was _ opaque _ , or , more precisely , the mean free path of a photon was a great deal smaller than the hubble length . as the universe cooled and expanded , the plasma `` recombined '' into neutral atoms , first the helium , then a little later the hydrogen .",
    "if we consider hydrogen alone , the process of recombination can be described by the saha equation for the equilibrium ionization fraction @xmath143 of the hydrogen @xcite : @xmath144 here @xmath145 is the electron mass and @xmath146 is the ionization energy of hydrogen .",
    "the physically important parameter affecting recombination is the density of protons and electrons compared to photons .",
    "this is determined by the _ baryon asymmetry _ , which is described as the ratio of baryons to photons : @xmath147 here @xmath148 is the baryon density and @xmath149 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath150 , @xmath151 the most recent result from the wmap satellite gives @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "recombination happens quickly ( i.e. , in much less than a hubble time @xmath62 ) , but it is not instantaneous .",
    "the universe goes from a completely ionized state to a neutral state over a range of redshifts @xmath153 .",
    "if we define recombination as an ionization fraction @xmath154 , we have that the temperature at recombination @xmath155 .    what happens to the photons after recombination ?",
    "once the gas in the universe is in a neutral state , the mean free path for a photon becomes much larger than the hubble length .",
    "the universe is then full of a background of freely propagating photons with a blackbody distribution of frequencies . at the time of recombination",
    ", the background radiation has a temperature of @xmath156 , and as the universe expands the photons redshift , so that the temperature of the photons drops with the increase of the scale factor , @xmath157 .",
    "we can detect these photons today .",
    "looking at the sky , this background of photons comes to us evenly from all directions , with an observed temperature of @xmath158 .",
    "this allows us to determine the redshift of recombination , @xmath159 this is the cosmic microwave background .",
    "since by looking at higher and higher redshift objects , we are looking further and further back in time , we can view the observation of cmb photons as imaging a uniform `` surface of last scattering '' at a redshift of 1100 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lss ] ) .",
    ".,width=336 ]    to the extent that recombination happens at the same time and in the same way everywhere , the cmb will be of precisely uniform temperature . while the observed cmb is highly isotropic",
    ", it is not perfectly so .",
    "the largest contribution to the anisotropy of the cmb as seen from earth is simply doppler shift due to the earth s motion through space .",
    "( put more technically , the motion is the earth s motion relative to a comoving cosmological reference frame . )",
    "cmb photons are slightly blueshifted in the direction of our motion and slightly redshifted opposite the direction of our motion .",
    "this blueshift / redshift shifts the temperature of the cmb so the effect has the characteristic form of a `` dipole '' temperature anisotropy ( fig . [",
    "fig : cobe ] ) .",
    "the dipole anisotropy , however , is a _ local _ phenomenon .",
    "any intrinsic , or primordial , anisotropy of the cmb is potentially of much greater cosmological interest . to describe the anisotropy of the cmb , we remember that the surface of last scattering appears to us as a spherical surface at a redshift of @xmath160 . therefore the natural parameters to use to describe the anisotropy of the cmb sky is as an expansion in spherical harmonics @xmath161 : @xmath162 if we assume isotropy , there is no preferred direction in the universe , and we expect the physics to be independent of the index @xmath93 .",
    "we can then define @xmath163 the @xmath164 contribution is just the dipole anisotropy , @xmath165    the dipole was first measured in the 1970 s by several groups @xcite .",
    "it was not until more than a decade after the discovery of the dipole anisotropy that the first observation was made of anisotropy for @xmath166 , by the differential microwave radiometer aboard the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite @xcite , launched in in 1990 .",
    "cobe observed that the anisotropy at the quadrupole and higher @xmath167 was two orders of magnitude smaller than the dipole : @xmath168 fig .",

    "( figure courtesy of the cobe science working group.),width=432 ]        this anisotropy represents intrinsic fluctuations in the cmb itself , due to the presence of tiny primordial density fluctuations in the cosmological matter present at the time of recombination .",
    "these density fluctuations are of great physical interest , since these are the fluctuations which later collapsed to form all of the structure in the universe , from superclusters to planets to graduate students .",
    "while the physics of recombination in the homogeneous case is quite simple , the presence of inhomogeneities in the universe makes the situation much more complicated .",
    "i describe some of the major effects in a qualitative way here , and refer the reader to the literature for a more detailed technical explanation of the relevant physics @xcite . in these lectures ,",
    "i primarily focus on the current status of the cmb as a probe of inflation , but there is much more to the story .",
    "the simplest contribution to the cmb anisotropy from density fluctuations is just a gravitational redshift , known as the _ sachs - wolfe effect _ @xcite .",
    "a photon coming from a region which is slightly denser than the average will have a slightly larger redshift due to the deeper gravitational well at the surface of last scattering .",
    "conversely , a photon coming from an underdense region will have a slightly smaller redshift .",
    "thus we can calculate the cmb temperature anisotropy due to the slightly varying newtonian potential @xmath171 from density fluctuations at the surface of last scattering : @xmath172,\\ ] ] where @xmath173 is the potential at the point the photon was emitted on the surface of last scattering , and @xmath174 is the potential at the point of observation , which can be treated as a constant .",

    "create a universe consistent with observation , we must have _ at least _ 60 or so e - folds of inflation , although in principle inflation could continue for much longer than this minimum amount .",
    "this dynamical explanation for the flatness and homogeneity of the universe is an interesting , but hardly compelling scenario .",
    "it could be that the universe started out homogeneous and flat because of initial conditions , either through some symmetry we do not yet understand , or because there are many universes , and we just happen to find ourselves in a highly unlikely realization which is homogeneous and geometrically flat . in the absence of any other observational handles on the physics of the very early universe , it is impossible to tell .",
    "however , flatness and homogeneity are not the whole story : inflation provides an elegant mechanism for explaining the _ inhomogeneity _ of the universe as well , which we discuss in section [ sec : perturbationsininflation ] .",
    "the universe we live in today is homogeneous , but only when averaged over very large scales . on small scales , the size of people or solar systems or galaxies or even clusters of galaxies , the universe we see is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "our world is full of complex structure , created by gravitational instability acting on tiny `` seed '' perturbations in the early universe . if we look as far back in time as the epoch of recombination , the universe on all scales was homogeneous to a high degree of precision , a few parts in @xmath333 .",
    "recent observational efforts such as the wmap satellite have made exquisitely precise measurements of the first tiny inhomogeneities in the universe , which later collapsed to form the structure we see today .",
    "( we discuss the wmap observation in more detail in section [ sec : observationalconstraints ] . ) therefore , another mystery of big bang cosmology is : what created the primordial perturbations ?",
    "this mystery is compounded by the fact that the perturbations we observe in the cmb exhibit correlations on scales much larger than the horizon size at the time of recombination , which corresponds to an angular multipole of @xmath334 , or about @xmath335 as observed on the sky today .",
    "this is another version of the horizon problem : not only is the universe homogeneous on scales larger than the horizon , but whatever created the primordial perturbations must also have been capable of generating fluctuations on scales larger than the horizon .",
    "inflation provides just such a mechanism @xcite .",
    "consider a perturbation in the cosmological fluid with wavelength @xmath226 . since the proper wavelength redshifts with expansion , @xmath336 , the _ comoving _ wavelength of the perturbation is a constant , @xmath337 this is true of photons or density perturbations or gravitational waves or any other wave propagating in the cosmological background . now",
    "consider this wavelength relative to the size of the horizon : we have seen that in general the horizon as measured in comoving units is proportional to the conformal time , @xmath338 . therefore , for matter- or radiation - dominated expansion , the horizon size",
    "_ grows _ in comoving units , so that a comoving length which is larger than the horizon at early times is smaller than the horizon at late times : modes `` fall into '' the horizon .",
    "the opposite is true during inflation , where the conformal time is negative and evolving toward zero : the comoving horizon size is still proportional to @xmath215 , but it now _ shrinks _ with cosmological expansion , and comoving perturbations which are initially smaller than the horizon are `` redshifted '' to scales larger than the horizon at late times ( fig .",
    "[ fig : horizon ] ) .",
    "if the universe is inflating at early times , and radiation- or matter - dominated at late times , perturbations in the density of the universe which are initially smaller than the horizon are redshifted during inflation to superhorizon scales .",
    "later , as the horizon begins to grow in comoving coordinates , the perturbations fall back into the horizon , where they act as a source for structure formation . in this way inflation explains the observed properties of perturbations in the universe , which exist at both super- and sub - horizon scales at the time of recombination .",
    "furthermore , an important consequence of this process is that the last perturbations to exit the horizon are the _ first _ to fall back in .",
    "therefore , the shortest wavelength perturbations are the ones which exited the horizon just at the end of inflation , @xmath339 , and longer wavelength perturbations exited the horizon earlier .",
    "perturbations about the same size as our horizon today exited the horizon during inflation at around @xmath340 .",
    "perturbations which exited the horizon earlier than that , @xmath341 , are still larger than our horizon today .",
    "therefore , it is only possible to place observational constraints on the _ end _ of inflation , about the last 60 e - folds .",
    "everything that happened before that , including anything that might tell us about the initial conditions which led to inflation , is most probably inaccessible to us .    this kinematic picture",
    ", however , does not itself explain the physical origin of the perturbations .",
    "inflation driven by a scalar field provides a natural explanation for this as well .",
    "the inflaton field @xmath46 evolving on the potential @xmath256 will not evolve completely classically , but will also be subject to small quantum fluctuations about its classical trajectory , which will in general be _",
    "inhomogeneous_. since the energy density of the universe during inflation is dominated by the inflaton field , quantum fluctuations in @xmath46 couple to the spacetime curvature and result in fluctuations in the density of the universe .",

    "<S> this series of lectures gives a pedagogical review of the subject of cosmological inflation . </S>",
    "<S> i discuss friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology and the horizon and flatness problems of the standard hot big bang , and introduce inflation as a solution to those problems , focusing on the simple scenario of inflation from a single scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> i discuss quantum modes in inflation and the generation of primordial tensor and scalar fluctuations . finally , i provide comparison of inflationary models to the wmap satellite measurement of the cosmic microwave background , and briefly discuss future directions for inflationary physics </S>",
    "<S> . the majority of the lectures should be accessible to advanced undergraduates or beginning graduate students with only a background in special relativity , although familiarity with general relativity and quantum field theory will be helpful for the more technical sections . </S>"
