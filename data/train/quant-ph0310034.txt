    "during the past 20 years a number of methods has been devised for state selective preparation and manipulation of discrete - level quantum systems @xcite .",
    "however , simple population oscillations , induced by a resonant driving pulse have received negligible attention as a prospective population manipulation method .",
    "this might be attributed to two reasons .",
    "the first is that rabi theory is based on the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , and all attempts to generalize it without rwa ( e.g. @xcite ) are mathematically very involved .",
    "the second is that no attempt has been made to analytically generalize the original rabi theory beyond two - level systems .    in this paper an analytic extension of rabi theory to transitions in many - level systems",
    "is presented .",
    "the aim is to design a driving pulse of the form : @xmath0 by establishing analytical optimization relations between its parameters : maximum pulse amplitude @xmath1 , pulse envelope shape @xmath2 , and time dependent carrier frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the goal of this enterprize is twofold .",
    "the first is to achieve as complete as possible transfer of population between two selected states of the system .",
    "the second is to make this transfer as rapid as possible .",
    "these two requirements , however , are contradictory ; population transfer can be accelerated by using a more intense drive , but at the same time a stronger drive increases involvement of remaining system levels in population dynamics and hence deteriorates population transfer between a selected pair of levels .    in this paper",
    "it is shown how , for a pulse of arbitrary shape and duration @xmath2 , the drive frequency can be analytically optimized to maximize the population transfer amplitude between selected two levels .",
    "in other words , rabi oscillation theory is re - formulated for the case of a many - level system driven by an arbitrary modulated pulse .",
    "all calculations in this section are done in a system of units in which @xmath4 .      a quantum system with n discrete stationary levels with energies @xmath5 is considered .",
    "the system is driven by a time dependent perturbation given in eq .",
    "( [ pulse ] ) . in the interaction picture , the dynamics of the system obeys the schroedinger equation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a vector of time - dependent expansion coefficients @xmath8 .",
    "the n@xmath9n matrix @xmath10 describes interaction between the system and perturbation .",
    "explicitly , its elements are given by : @xmath11 @xmath12 is transition moment between the i - th and the j - th levels induced by the perturbation . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the sign and the magnitude of the resonant frequency for the transition between the i - th and the j - th level .    the aim is to induce population transfer between two arbitrarily selected levels , designated by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , directly coupled by the perturbation ( i.e. such that @xmath17 ) . to simplify equations , the time",
    "variable t is re - scaled to @xmath18 , with transformation between the two given by : @xmath19 then with following substitutions : @xmath20 eq .",
    "( [ schrodinger ] ) transforms into : @xmath21 where : @xmath22    initial conditions for the problem of selective population transfer comprise complete population initially ( at @xmath23 ) contained in only one of the selected levels , either @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "the other selected level , as well as all the remaining n-2 perturbing levels of the system are unpopulated at this time .",
    "population evolution @xmath24 of the i - th level is determined from @xmath25 .",
    "having in mind that @xmath26 , the explicit form of the general dynamical equation ( [ n level ] ) in a two - level system is : @xmath27 under certain conditions ( for a thorough discussion see eg .",
    "@xcite ) this equation may be simplified by introducing the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) . within the rwa ,",
    "dynamical impact of complex exponentials @xmath28 is neglected and these may be eliminated from the equation .",
    "hence , ( [ 2 level ] ) reduces to : @xmath29 finally , adjusting the perturbation frequency to the resonant value ( @xmath30 ) results in @xmath31 , and ( [ 2 level rwa ] ) reduces to : @xmath32    as may be easily demonstrated by solving this simple equation , the resonant perturbation induces complete periodic transfer of the population between two levels . the time @xmath33 ( in units of @xmath18 ) or t ( in units of t ) required for a single population oscillation is determined from : @xmath34 this is a well known result which forms the basis of @xmath35-pulse theory .",
    "as will be shown in subsequent sections , the whole analytical approach to the maximization of the population oscillation amplitude in a general many - level quantum system may be reduced to discussion of a three - level system . along with two selected levels @xmath15 and @xmath16 ,",
    "the system now discussed contains one additional perturbing level , designated with index p. the only requirements on the system internal structure are that @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "while the first two requirements are necessary , the last one does not reduce the generality of the final results to any significant extent and it is introduced for calculational convenience .    the three - level version of the dynamical equation ( [ n level ] ) is :    @xmath38      in order to solve equation ( [ 3 level ] ) two assumptions shall be made .",
    "the legitimacy of both of them may be checked retrospectively from the final solution .",
    "the first one is that the rwa may be applied for transition @xmath39 so that exponentials containing @xmath40 may be dropped from equation ( [ 3 level ] ) .",
    "a simple way to verify this assumption s legitimacy may be done using rabi profile plots , as described in @xcite .",
    "the second is that the dynamical time - scale of solutions for @xmath41 is much longer than that for @xmath42 .",
    "this enables one to regard @xmath43 as a slowly changing parameter in the dynamical equation for @xmath42 .",
    "the solution to this equation hence may be obtained in terms of a parameter whose value needs not be known beforehand .    introducing the first of the assumptions into ( [ 3 level ] ) and reformulating it slightly , a set of two coupled differential equations",
    "is obtained :    @xmath44    now consider just equation ( [ 3 level p ] ) .",
    "the formal solution to this equation is : @xmath45 this integral can not be precisely evaluated until the exact form of the solution @xmath46 and optimized perturbation frequency @xmath47 - through which @xmath48 and @xmath49 are defined ( ( [ definition f ] ) , ( [ definition g ] ) ) - are known .",
    "certainly , these are not known before the final solution of the whole optimization procedure is obtained",
    ". however , introduction of the second assumption enables one to evaluate the partial contribution to the integral in ( [ formal sol ] ) from some interval @xmath50 within which changes in all these functions are so insignificant that functions themselves may be approximated by a constant value .",
    "the aim of the optimization procedure is effectively to eliminate the dynamical impact of the perturbing level on population transfer between the two selected levels .",
    "if this is achieved , then dynamics of subsystem @xmath51 will be very similar to the dynamics of the pure two level system .",
    "hence the population oscillation period will be about @xmath52 , which is then the dynamical time - scale for @xmath41 . as optimizing variations of the driving frequency @xmath47",
    "are caused exclusively by the changes in perturbation envelope amplitude @xmath53 it is transparent that dynamical time - scales for @xmath48 and @xmath49 are of the same order as that for @xmath53 .",
    "the dynamical time - scale of @xmath53 must be of the same order as that of @xmath41 or longer , for otherwise not even a single complete population transfer would be achieved .",
    "hence , in the interval @xmath54 such that @xmath55 , the optimized functions @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 may be considered constant , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "finally , in this interval @xmath62 may be approximated by @xmath63 . in several simple steps",
    "the following result is obtained : @xmath64 where : @xmath65 the constant term @xmath66 includes both the @xmath67 and the integration constant obtained by inserting the lower limit value @xmath68 into the solution .",
    "its exact value can not be determined since integration can not be analytically stretched over the whole interval from @xmath69 to @xmath70 . however , since @xmath71 this constant is of the order of average value of remaining rapid complexly rotating expression , which is very nearly equal to zero .",
    "if detuning from resonance is assumed small , the perturbation frequency may be approximated by @xmath72 so that @xmath73 . the obtained solution ( [ apert ] ) then immediately provides an upper limit for the magnitude of perturbing level population : @xmath74 in general @xmath75 , so the whole bracket can be reduced to 1 , and the maximum amplitude of the perturbing level s population is roughly @xmath76 .",
    "hence , this quantity may be regarded as a parameter determining the effective strength of the perturbation applied to a particular transition : if @xmath77 , then the dynamical impact of level p is negligible and the perturbation may be considered weak ; if @xmath78 , the perturbation is very strong .",
    "this result may also be cast into a convenient quantitative form : to keep the leakage of the population to the perturbing level @xmath79 below a certain limiting value @xmath80 , the greatest drive intensity which may be employed is roughly : @xmath81      when solution ( [ apert ] ) is plugged into eq .",
    "( [ 3 level rwa ab ] ) a single closed dynamical equation is obtained for a two - level sub - system @xmath51 : @xmath82 with : @xmath83    now a transformation of the @xmath51 sub - system vector is sought : @xmath84 with : @xmath85 such that the transformed sub - system vector satisfies : @xmath86 as this equation is identical to ( [ 2 level rwa resonant ] ) , the corresponding solution would represent complete population transfer oscillations between levels @xmath15 and @xmath16 . introducing transformation ( [ transformation ] ) into ( [ 3 level final ab ] ) , the following equation is obtained : @xmath87 if this is to be fitted to form ( [ transformed to rabi ] ) , the following conditions must be fulfilled : @xmath88 which can be compactly written as : @xmath89 integration of the last equation yields the formal solution for @xmath90 from which optimized perturbation frequency @xmath47 may be extracted : @xmath91 since @xmath90 is generally a small quantity , this equation may be solved iteratively , using @xmath92 as the initial value . the contribution to the total @xmath90 from the second integral , containing rapidly rotating complex exponentials , may be shown to be minor compared to the one from the first , real integral . however",
    ", the very fact that there is an imaginary contribution to the optimized perturbation frequency indicates that the optimization procedure simply can not completely annihilate the dynamical impact of the perturbing level .",
    "nevertheless , as will be demonstrated in the following section , it may be done to a very good approximation .    transforming ( [ delta solution ] )",
    "back to the original time coordinate @xmath93 and keeping only the first integral yields the approximate recurrent solution for @xmath94 : @xmath95 introducing the zeroth - order approximation @xmath92 into this equation , the analytic expression for the first - order optimized frequency is obtained : @xmath96 for all but the strongest perturbations ( i.e. such that @xmath97 or greater ) higher - order corrections are not needed",
    ".    note that the frequency shift in ( [ delta recurrent ] ) and ( [ bez rot ] ) may be either away from the perturbing line or towards it .",
    "which case it will be depends on the relation between the energies of the three system levels : if level @xmath16 has either the highest or the lowest total energy , so that both transitions @xmath98 and @xmath99 are energy - wise either downwards ( @xmath100 ) or upwards ( @xmath101 ) then the shift will be _ towards _ the perturbing line ; on the other hand , if the energy of level @xmath16 is in between the other two energies so that these two transitions are in the opposite directions ( @xmath102 ) , the shift will be _ away _ from the perturbing line .      the approach presented in sec .",
    "ii.3 can be easily extended to include multiple perturbation levels .",
    "the perturbation now couples each of the selected levels to a certain number of perturbing levels , and each of perturbing levels dynamics is calculated independently from all the others .",
    "this may be done as long as the perturbation due to each single perturbing level is kept reasonably small ( gauged by standards of the three - level system ) .",
    "accordingly , the many - level analog of eq .",
    "( [ 3 level final ab ] ) is : @xmath103 with : @xmath104 where all quantities are defined analogously to the ones in the previous section , and complex rotating terms have been eliminated .",
    "the many - level equivalent of ( [ difjed ] ) is : @xmath105 and the first - order solution is : @xmath106    the total perturbation intensity for the case of a many - level system may be estimated by considering the maximum total population of all perturbing levels : @xmath107 hence , if @xmath108 the perturbation of the many - level system is small ; otherwise it is large . in the following section",
    "it shall be demonstrated that ( [ sigma tot ] ) provides not just a qualitative , but also an excellent quantitative criterion for determination of the impact of perturbing levels on population oscillation dynamics .",
    "in this section numerical simulations of system dynamics for resonant ( i.e. un - optimized ) and optimized ( determined from ( [ delta recurrent ] ) and ( [ bez rot multi ] ) ) perturbation frequencies are presented and compared .",

    "the maximum value of the perturbing field intensity field , @xmath114 , achieved at time @xmath115 is the same . in the case of the three - level system , it is such that @xmath116 while in case of the many - level system @xmath117.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +      first a simple three - level system is considered . in this case",

    "system parameters are such that the optimizing frequency shift is away from the perturbing line . in all cases , the total pulse duration @xmath128 equals 7.25 ns .    in order to present clearly the improvement that optimization of driving frequency induces in population transfer between the two selected levels , the perturbation strength in following examples is set to an extreme value : @xmath116 .",

    "the numerical model used for the calculation of the system dynamics includes 310 levels ( 31 rotational @xmath9 10 vibrational ) .",

    "it was demonstrated in the previous subsection that optimization indeed leads to improvement of the population transfer dynamics , even when the perturbation is very large .",
    "however , as in such conditions complete population transfer is unattainable , these examples were more of a qualitative nature from the standpoint of population transfer control .",
    "the many - level system considered now is more realistic than the previous three - level one and the focus is shifted to quantitative predictions .",
    "hence , the employed drive intensity will be much smaller so that results can be directly applied to population transfer control .",

    "maximum amplitudes of electric field are likewise equal in all three cases , but now they are chosen so that @xmath117 .",

    "4 the optimized dynamics of two target system levels is shown for each of three pulse envelopes . in all cases two things should be noted .",
    "first , the general shape of the optimized dynamics of each of the two selected levels is fairly close to pure sinusoidal oscillations .",
    "this is more so , the smaller the perturbation strength parameter @xmath134 is .",
    "however , the complete population transfer is again not achieved because a certain share of the population unavoidably ends up in perturbing levels .",
    "second , the actual instantaneous loss of population transfer is close to ( and actually smaller than ) @xmath135 , as indicated by dotted line in each of the plots .",
    "this shows that @xmath134 indeed is a good quantitative ( and not just qualitative ) indicator of relative drive strength . the argument which led to relation ( [ max drive ] )",
    "may hence again be applied to determine the maximum intensity of the driving radiation to be employed if population losses to perturbing levels are to be smaller than some pre - defined amount .",
    "as was stated in the introduction , the aim of this paper is to explore and refine the use of rabi oscillations as a tool in selective population manipulation of complex discrete - level quantum systems .",
    "the main aims of such manipulation are as great as possible population transfer and at the same time as short as possible population transfer time . from the simple two - level theory it is well known that the an increase in drive intensity yields a reduction in population oscillation period .",
    "however , the same theory can neither fully disclose all the limitations of this result that arise from the complexity of the internal structure of a many - level system , nor can it handle the unavoidable loss of population to the rest of the system .",
    "results presented in this paper fill this gap : they enable one to determine the maximum possible drive intensity ( and hence the lower limit of time ) with which oscillations of pre - selected amplitude ( say 99% ) may be achieved , and at the same time to minimize unavoidable losses of the population to non - targeted system levels .",
    "finally , the method of rabi spectra ( see @xcite ) presents a simple , yet useful conceptual supplement to the analysis presented in this paper .    in order to achieve the quickest possible population transfer between two pre - selected levels , driving pulse should be tailored so that it produces only a single half - oscillation of the population .",
    "however , during research for this paper it has been noted that for strong fields standard @xmath35-pulse theory ( see equation ( [ pi pulse ] ) and reference @xcite ) is also deficient when it comes to the complex many - level systems .",
    "work is currently in progress on analytical extension of standard @xmath35-pulse theory that would resolve this issue .",
