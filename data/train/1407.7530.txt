    "despite being very rare , massive stars such as luminous blue variable ( lbvs ) , red super giants ( rsgs ) , and wolf - rayet stars ( wrs ) play a pivotal role in enriching the interstellar medium ( ism ) through mass loss , and they are an important source of heavier elements contributing to the chemical enrichment of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the deaths of these massive stars are associated with some of the highest energy phenomena in the universe such as core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , neutrino bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and gravitational wave bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the physical mechanism , energetics and observed properties of these events depend on the structure and terminal mass of the evolved stars at core - collapse , which in turn are determined by stellar mass loss ( see , e.g. , review by * ?",
    "in addition , there is also evidence that some supernova ( sn ) progenitors undergo major mass ejection events shortly before exploding ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , further altering the properties of the explosion and implying a connection between some eruptive mass - loss events and death .",
    "it is generally agreed that the effects of winds are metallicity dependent  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sne requiring a very dense circumstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predominantly occur in lower metallicity galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this strongly suggests that the nature and distribution of stars undergoing impulsive mass loss will also be metallicity dependent and a full understanding requires exploring galaxies beyond the milky way .",
    "understanding the evolution of massive ( m@xmath14m@xmath15 ) stars is challenging even when mass loss is restricted to continuous winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , shorter , episodic eruptions , rather than steady winds , may be the dominant mass loss mechanism in the tumultuous evolutionary stages toward the end of the lives of the most massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as they undergo periods of photospheric instabilities leading to stellar transients ( @xmath16 ) followed by rapid ( @xmath17year ) mass - loss in the last stages of their evolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "deciphering the rate of these eruptions and their consequences is challenging because no true analog of @xmath0car in mass , luminosity , energetics , mass lost and age has been found ( see @xcite ) , and the associated transients are significantly fainter than supernova explosions and are easily missed .",
    "these phases are as difficult to model theoretically as they are to simulate computationally .",
    "dense winds tend to form dust , although for hot stars the wind must be dense enough to form a pseudo - photosphere in the wind  @xcite that shields the dust formation region from the uv emission of the star @xcite .",
    "the star will then be heavily obscured by dust for an extended period after the eruption ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the great eruption of @xmath0car between 1840 and 1860 is the most studied case of a stellar outburst ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath18 ejecta are now seen as a dusty nebula around the star absorbing and then reradiating @xmath19 of the light in the mid - ir .",
    "this means that dusty ejecta are a powerful and long - lived signature of eruption .",
    "the emission from these dusty envelopes peaks in the mid - ir with a characteristic red color and a rising or flat spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the _ spitzer _ irac  @xcite bands .    in the galaxy ,",
    "stars with resolved shells of dust emission are easily found at 24@xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the 24@xmath20 band is that it can be used to identify dusty ejecta up to @xmath21years after formation .",
    "a minority of these objects are very luminous stars ( l@xmath22l@xmath15 ) with massive ( @xmath23m@xmath15 ) shells ( see summaries by @xcite ) .",
    "these include agcar  @xcite , the pistol star  @xcite , g79.29@xmath240.46  @xcite , wray17@xmath2596  @xcite , and iras18576@xmath240341  @xcite .",
    "these systems are significantly older ( @xmath26years ) than @xmath0car , which makes it difficult to use the ejecta to probe the rate or mechanism of mass - loss .",
    "still , the abundance of galactic shells implies that the rate of @xmath0car - like eruptions is on the order of a modest fraction of the ccsn rate  @xcite .",
    "their emission peaks in the shorter irac bands when they are relatively young ( @xmath27years ) because the dust becomes cooler and the emission shifts to longer wavelengths as the ejected material expands @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to quantify searches for such objects in our galaxy because it is hard to determine the distances and the survey volume because we have to look through the crowded and dusty disk of the galaxy .",
    "surveys of nearby galaxies are both better defined and can be used to build larger samples of younger systems whose evolution can be studied to better understand the mechanism .",
    "we previously demonstrated in @xcite that it is possible to identify post - eruptive massive stars in galaxies beyond the local group using the mid - ir excess created by warm circumstellar dust despite the crowding problems created by the limited spatial resolution of _ spitzer _ at greater distances .",
    "in @xcite ( `` paperi '' hereafter ) we used archival _ spitzer _",
    "irac images of seven @xmath2mpc galaxies ( closest to farthest : ngc6822 , m33 , ngc300 , ngc2403 , m81 , ngc0247 , ngc7793 ) in a pilot study to search for extragalactic analogs of @xmath0car .",
    "we found 34 candidates with flat or rising mid - ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and total mid - ir luminosity @xmath28 . here , in paperii , we characterize these sources and quantify the rate of episodic mass loss from massive stars in the last stages of evolution .",
    "first , we construct extended optical through far - ir seds using archival hst , 2mass , and _ herschel _ data as well as ground based data ( section[sec : data ] ) .",
    "then , we classify the sources as either stellar or non - stellar based on properties of the extended seds and model the seds to infer the properties of the underlying star and the obscuring circumstellar medium ( section[sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "next , we relate these properties to the observed ccsn rate of the targeted galaxies to quantify the rate of episodic mass loss in the last stages of massive star evolution ( section[sec : discussion3 ] ) .",
    "finally , we consider the implications of our findings for theories and observations of massive star evolution and their fates ( section[sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "in this section , we describe the details of how we obtained the photometric measurements at various wavelengths to determine the properties of the candidates from paperi .",
    "the optical through far - ir photometry are reported in table[tab : photo ] , and the extended seds are shown in figures [ fig : accept ] and [ fig : reject ] .",
    "we utilized vizier @xcite to search for other observations of the candidates , in particular for wise ( @xcite , @xmath29 ) , 2mass ( @xcite , @xmath30 ) , sdss ( @xcite , @xmath31 ) and x - ray detections .",
    "for m33 , we used the @xmath32 images from the @xcite optical survey , and archival hst images of ngc300 , ngc2403 , m81 , ngc247 and ngc7793 .",
    "finally , we used _",
    "pacs data to supplement the _ spitzer _ measurements .    for the _ spitzer _ irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and @xmath33 as well as mips @xcite 24 , 70 , and @xmath34 data",
    ", we use the measurements reported in paperi . for m33 , our measurements were based on irac data from @xcite and mips data from the _ _ spitzer heritage archive__. data from the lvl survey @xcite were used for ngc300 and ngc247 , and data from the sings survey @xcite for ngc6822 , ngc2403 , and m81 .",
    "we used the _ herschel _ pacs @xcite 70 , 100 , and @xmath34 images available from the public _",
    "_ herschel science archive__. although both mips and pacs cover the same far - ir wavelength range ( @xmath35 ) , herschel has significantly higher resolution ( see figure[fig : mips_pacs ] ) .",
    "all three pacs band data were available for m33 and ngc7793 , 70 and 160@xmath20 data were available for ngc2403 and m81 , and 100 and 160@xmath20 data were available for ngc300 .",
    "there are no publicly available pacs images of the candidates in ngc247 .",
    "we used aperture photometry ( iraf apphot / phot ) with the extraction apertures and aperture corrections from @xcite and given in table[tab : pacs ] .",
    "as with our treatment of the mips 70 and 160@xmath20 measurements in paperi , we treat the measurements obtained in the pacs bands as upper limits because the spatial resolution of these bands requires increasingly large apertures at longer wavelengths . for similar reasons , we also treat the wise @xmath29 fluxes , where available , as upper limits .    for the optical photometry of the candidates in m33",
    ", we used the local group galaxies survey @xmath32 images @xcite .",
    "first we verified that the coordinates match with the irac images to within few@xmath36 and then used @xmath37 radius extraction apertures centered on the irac source locations .",
    "we transformed the aperture fluxes to vega - calibrated magnitudes using zero point offsets determined from the difference between our aperture magnitudes and calibrated magnitudes for bright stars in the @xcite catalog of m33 .",
    "for the candidates in ngc300 , m81 , ngc2403 , and ngc247 , we searched the acs nearby galaxy survey ( angst , * ? ? ? * ) @xmath38 , @xmath39 and ( where available ) @xmath40 band point source catalogs derived using dolphot @xcite .",
    "we verified that the irac and hst astrometry of the ngc300 , ngc2403 and ngc247 images agree within ( mostly ) @xmath41 to ( in a few cases ) @xmath42 .",
    "we corrected the astrometry of the m81 hst images using the lbt images described later in this section to achieve similar astrometric accuracy .",
    "we also used the hst @xmath40-band photometry of m81 from hst program go-10250 ( p.i .",
    "j.huchra ) .",
    "we retrieved all publicly available archival hst images of ngc7793 overlapping the irac source locations along with the associated photometry tables from the hubble legacy archive .",
    "the hst and _ spitzer _ images have a significant ( few@xmath43 ) astrometric mis - match , and there are too few reference stars in the hst images to adequately improve the astrometry .",
    "therefore , we utilized the iraf geoxymap and geoxytran tasks to locally match the overlapping hst and _ spitzer _ images of ngc7793 within uncertainties of @xmath44 .",
    "we have variability data for the galaxies m81 and ngc2403 from a large binocular telescope survey in the @xmath45 bands that is searching for failed supernovae @xcite , and studying supernova progenitors and impostors @xcite , and cepheid variables @xcite .",
    "we analyzed 27 epochs of data for m81 and 28 epochs of data for ngc2403 , spanning a 5year period .",
    "the images were analyzed with the isis image subtraction package @xcite to produce light curves ( see figure[fig : lc ] ) .",
    "in this section , we first discuss how we classify the candidates based on their seds .",
    "next , we describe the non - stellar and stellar sources . finally , we model the seds of the stellar sources to determine their physical properties .",
    "figure[fig : accept ] shows the seds of the stellar sources with the best fit sed models over plotted and figure[fig : reject ] shows the seds of the non - stellar sources .",
    "we classify the candidates either as stellar or non - stellar based on their photometric properties .",
    "we focus on identifying two tell - tale signatures of the sed of a luminous star obscured by warm circumstellar dust  low optical fluxes or flux - limits compared to the mid - ir luminosities and signs of the seds turning over between @xmath46 and @xmath47 . towards longer wavelengths ,",
    "emission from warm circumstellar dust should peak between the irac @xmath46 and mips @xmath47 bands .",
    "it is almost impossible for mass lost from a single star to to both have a significant optical depth and a dust temperature cold enough to peak at wavelengths longer than @xmath48 .",
    "such systems are almost certainly star clusters with significant amounts of cold dust . therefore , any sed that appears to have a steep slope between @xmath49 and @xmath47 is considered to be a likely cluster , rather than a single dust obscured star",
    ". frequently , these sources are also too luminous to be a single star . at the shorter wavelengths",
    ", we expect a dusty star to have relatively lower luminosity compared to its mid - ir luminosity and redder optical colors .",
    "we examine the hst @xmath50/@xmath39 and the @xmath51/@xmath39 color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for each source for which hst data is available .",
    "the presence of a very red optical counterpart or the absence of a luminous star supports the existence of significant dust obscuration . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of a blue or bright optical counterpart makes it likely that the source is a star cluster , a background galaxy / agn , or a foreground star .",
    "we first search for bright and/or red optical sources within the @xmath42 matching radius that can be the obvious counterpart of the bright and red irac source .",
    "next , if multiple bright and/or red optical matches are found , we identify the best astrometric match to the irac location . finally ,",
    "if no reasonable match is found , we adopt the flux of the brightest of the nearby sources as a conservative upper limit on the optical luminosity of the candidate .",
    "to demonstrate these , we discuss the case of m81 - 12 in detail .",
    "m81 - 12 has a steeply rising optical and mid - ir sed ( figure[fig : eta_sed ] ) with two distinct peaks  one in the near - ir , between the @xmath52-band and 3.6 , and another in the mid - ir between 8 and 24 .",
    "figure[fig : cmd ] shows the hst optical cmd for sources near the location of m81 - 12 .",
    "besides the sources within the @xmath42 matching radius , it also shows all sources within @xmath53 of the candidate using a different symbol to emphasize the absence of any other unusual nearby sources .",
    "we detect a very red ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) hst counterpart with an excellent astrometric match ( @xmath59 , figure[fig : m81 - 12_all ] ) to the irac position .",
    "this source is the brightest , red hst point source within @xmath60 of the irac location ( figure[fig : cmd ] ) and so we define it to be the counterpart used in the sed .",
    "the lbt @xmath39 and @xmath52 band light curves show a variable source with the correlated irregular variability ( @xmath610.4mag , figure[fig : lc ] ) typical of many evolved massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "based on the sed shape and the unambiguous detection of a red , variable optical counterpart , we conclude that m81 - 12 is a massive , dust - obscured , single star .",
    "in addition to objectx ( m33 - 1 ) , we identified 17 additional dust obscured stars and classified 16 others as non - stellar .",
    "we left one source ( n7793 - 12 ) unclassified due to a lack of sufficient optical data ( it falls on an hst / acs chip gap ) .",
    "it could well be a dusty star , but we do not discuss it further .",
    "we identify 18 ( including objectx / m33 - 1 ) sources as dusty stars . of these , four are in m33 ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 ) , one is in ngc300 ( n300 - 1 ) , four are in ngc2403 ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) , five are in m81 ( 5 , 6 , 11 , 12 , 14 ) , and four are in ngc7793 ( 3 , 9 , 10 , 13 ) .",
    "none are in ngc6822 ( a low - mass , low sfr galaxy ) or ngc247 ( all three candidates turned out to be non - stellar ) .",
    "these stars have low optical fluxes or flux limits and their seds turn over between @xmath46 and @xmath47 . moreover ,",
    "m81 - 11 , m81 - 12 and n2403 - 2 are detected as optically variable sources in the lbt monitoring data .",
    "n2403 - 3 is a saturated source in the hst images , and we use the lbt flux measurements as upper limits on its optical flux .",
    "n2403 - 3 and n2403 - 5 are not variable in the lbt data .",
    "m81 - 5 is 056 from a variable x - ray source with maximum luminosity of @xmath62ergss@xmath63 @xcite , which is consistent with the source being an x - ray binary  @xcite .",
    "n7793 - 3 is also a x - ray source @xcite , with a maximum x - ray luminosity of @xmath64erg@xmath65 and is classified as an hmxb by @xcite .",
    "there are 16 candidates whose seds indicate that they are not self - obscured stars .",
    "five sources in m33 ( 2 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 ) have seds that nearly monotonically rise from the optical to @xmath47 , unambiguously indicating the presence of cold dust associated with star clusters .",
    "as we discussed in paperi , it is unlikely for an ultra - compact star cluster to host both evolved massive stars and significant amounts of intra - cluster dust .",
    "eight sources can not be dust obscured stars given their very high optical luminosities : n2403 - 1 ( likely a foreground star ) , m81 - 7 , m81 - 10 , n247 - 3 ( likely a foreground star , optical magnitudes from @xcite ) , n7793 - 4 , n7793 - 8 , n7793 - 11 , and n7793 - 14 .",
    "the three observed with the lbt , m81 - 7 , m81 - 10 and n2403 - 1 , are not variable .",
    "we consider three more sources as most likely non - stellar due to reasons that are unique in each case      * n247 - 1 is located far from the plane of its edge - on host and is unlikely to be associated with the host .",
    "* n7793 - 1 is located at the edge of its host galaxy and the pacs far - ir flux limits are significantly lower than those of the sources that we classified as obscured stars , indicating an absence of the diffuse emission commonly associated with star forming regions .",
    "* n7793 - 6 has an sed that can conceivably be produced by a hot star with significant circumstellar material , although the near - ir peak seems too narrow . however",
    ", a close inspection of the hst image shows that this source is in a dense star - forming region with significant diffuse light indicating the presence of intra - cluster dust .",
    "none of the sources in the hst image are a good astrometric match to the irac location .",
    "it is more likely , in this case , that warm intercluster dust is producing the mid - ir flux excess .",
    "the optical fluxes adopted here are those of the most luminous hst source within a larger matching radius of @xmath66 .    in paperi",
    ", we anticipated that further analysis would show that most , if not all , of the candidates are in fact non - stellar sources .",
    "based on the expected surface density of extragalactic contaminants , of the 46 initial candidates we estimated that all but @xmath67 are background galaxies / agn with 11 already being identified as such .",
    "here we find that @xmath68 ( including objectx ) of the candidates are dusty massive stars and very few of the other sources are background galaxies .",
    "we do not presently have an explanation for the fewer than expected background sources in the targeted fields .",
    "we fit the seds of the 18 self - obscured stars using dusty @xcite to model radiation transfer through a spherical dusty medium surrounding a star and figure[fig : accept ] shows the best fit models .",
    "we estimate the properties of a black - body source obscured by a surrounding dusty shell that would produce the best fit to the observed sed ( see figure[fig : dusty2 ] for an example ) .",
    "we considered models with either graphitic or silicate @xcite dust .",
    "we distributed the dust in a shell with a @xmath69 density distribution .",
    "the models are defined by the stellar luminosity ( @xmath70 ) , stellar temperature ( @xmath71 ) , the total ( absorption plus scattering ) @xmath39-band optical depth ( @xmath72 ) , the dust temperature at the inner edge of the dust distribution ( @xmath73 ) , and the shell thickness @xmath74 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath75 has little effect on the results , and after a series of experiments with @xmath76 , we fixed @xmath77 for the final results .",
    "we embedded dusty inside a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) driver to fit each sed by varying @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "we limit @xmath71 to a maximum value of 30,000k to exclude unrealistic temperature regimes .",
    "the parameters of the best fit model determine the radius of the inner edge of the dust distribution ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the mass of the shell is @xmath79 where we simply scale the mass for a @xmath39 band dust opacity of @xmath80  @xmath81g@xmath63 and the result can be rescaled for other choices as @xmath82 . despite using a finite width shell ,",
    "we focus on @xmath78 because it is well - constrained while @xmath83 ( or @xmath75 ) is not .",
    "we can also estimate an age for the shell as @xmath84 where we scale the results to @xmath85kms@xmath63 .",
    "for a comparison sample , we followed the same procedures for the seds of three well - studied dust obscured stars : @xmath0car @xcite ; the galactic oh / ir star irc+10420 @xcite ; and m33 s variablea , which had a brief period of high mass loss leading to dust obscuration over the last @xmath86years @xcite .",
    "we use the same seds for these stars as in @xcite . in table[tab : mcmc ] , we report @xmath87 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath71 , @xmath78 , @xmath70 , @xmath88 ( equation[eqn : mejecta ] ) , and @xmath89 ( equation[eqn : age ] ) for the best fit models for these three sources as well as the newly identified stars .",
    "the stellar luminosities required for both dust types are mutually consistent because the optically thick dust shell acts as a calorimeter . however , because the stars are heavily obscured and we have limited optical / near - ir seds , the stellar temperatures generally are not well constrained . in some cases , for different dust types , equally good models can be obtained for either a hot ( @xmath90 , such as a lbv in quiescence ) or a relatively cooler ( @xmath91 , such as a lbv in outburst ) star . indeed , for many of our 18 sources , the best fit is near the fixed upper limit of @xmath92 .",
    "to address this issue , we also tabulated the models on a grid of three fixed stellar temperatures , @xmath93 , for each dust type .",
    "the resulting best fit parameters are reported in tables [ tab : graphitic ] and [ tab : silicate ] .",
    "figure[fig : hr_like ] shows the integrated luminosities of the newly identified self - obscured stars described in section[sec : stars ] as a function of @xmath88 for the best fit graphitic models of each source .",
    "objectx , irc@xmath94 , m33vara , and @xmath0car are shown for comparison .",
    "figure[fig : dusty ] shows the same quantities , but for various dust models and temperature assumptions .",
    "it is apparent from figure[fig : dusty ] and tables [ tab : mcmc ] , [ tab : graphitic ] and [ tab : silicate ] that the integrated luminosity and ejecta mass estimates are robust to these uncertainties .",
    "the exceptions are n2403 - 4 and n7793 - 3 . without any optical or near - ir data , many of the models of n7793 - 3 are unstable so we simply drop it .",
    "the only models having a luminosity in significant excess of @xmath95 are some of the fixed temperature models of n2403 - 4 .",
    "these models have a poor goodness of fit and can be ignored .",
    "one check on our selection methods is to examine the distribution of shell radii .",
    "crudely , we can see a shell until it either becomes optically thin or too cold , so the probability distribution of a shell s radius assuming a constant expansion velocity is @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "an ensemble of shells with similar @xmath98 should then show this distribution .",
    "figure[fig : complete ] shows the cumulative histogram ( excluding n7793 - 3 ) of the inner shell radii ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the curves show the expected distribution where we simply normalized to the point where @xmath99 .",
    "the agreement shows that our sample should be relatively complete up to @xmath100-@xmath101 cm which corresponds to a maximum age of @xmath102 figure[fig : tv ] shows the age ( @xmath103 ) of the shells as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "we also show lines corresponding to optical depths of @xmath104 .",
    "as expected , we see no sources with very low or high optical depths , as we should have trouble finding sources with @xmath105 due to a lack of mid - ir emission and @xmath106 due to the dust photosphere being too cold ( peak emission in the far - ir ) .",
    "indeed , most of the dusty stars have @xmath107 and none has @xmath108 .",
    "the large @xmath89 estimate for @xmath0car when scaled by @xmath109 is due to its unusually large ejecta velocities ( @xmath110kms@xmath63 along the long axis @xcite compared to typical lbv shells ( @xmath111kms@xmath63 , @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of surveying external galaxies with a significant supernova rate is that we can translate our results into estimates of abundances and rates .",
    "we scale our rates using the observed supernova rate of @xmath112  year@xmath63 ( @xmath113 at 90% confidence ) . as we discussed in paperi , this is significantly higher than standard star formation rate estimates for these galaxies , but the sn rate is directly proportional to the massive star formation rate rather than an indirect indicator , and similar discrepancies , although not as dramatic , have been noted in other contexts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this section",
    "we first outline how we will estimate rates , and then we discuss the constraints on analogs of @xmath0car and the implications of our sample of luminous dusty stars .    we are comparing a sample of @xmath114 supernovae observed over @xmath115  years to a sample of @xmath116 candidate stars which are detectable by our selection procedures for a time @xmath117 . in paperi",
    "we used dusty to model the detection of expanding dusty shells and found that a good estimate for the detection time period was @xmath118 for shells with masses in the range @xmath119 around stars of luminosity @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the duration of the `` wind '' phase and the second term is an estimate of how long the shell will be detected after the heavy mass loss phase ends .",
    "the principle uncertainty lies in the choice of the velocity , @xmath122 .",
    "if the rate of events in the sample is @xmath123 , then we expect to find @xmath124 candidates .",
    "the transient rate in a sample of galaxies is less interesting than comparing the rate to the supernova rate .",
    "let @xmath125 be the fraction of massive ( @xmath126 ) stars that create the transients , where @xmath127 if we assume a salpeter imf @xcite , that all stars more massive than @xmath128 become supernovae and that all stars more massive than @xmath129 cause the transients .",
    "if each star undergoes an average of @xmath130 eruptions , then the rate of transients is related to the rate of supernovae by @xmath131 . the interesting quantity to constrain is @xmath132 rather than @xmath123",
    "poisson statistics provide constraints on the rates , where @xmath133 for @xmath134 events observed over a time period @xmath135 .",
    "this means that the probability of the rates given the data is @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are priors on the rates which we will assume to be uniform and we have set @xmath114 . if we now change variables to compute @xmath139 and marginalize over the unknown supernova rate , we find that the probability distribution for the ratio of the rates is @xmath140 with the standard normalization that @xmath141 . for our estimates of @xmath139 we present either 90% confidence upper limits or the value corresponding to the median probability and symmetric 90% probability confidence regions .",
    "note that the probability distribution really just depends on the product @xmath142 , so the results for any given estimate of @xmath117 are easily rescaled .",
    "it is immediately obvious from figure[fig : hr_like ] that none of the sources we identified closely resemble @xmath0car .",
    "their typical luminosities of @xmath143 correspond to @xmath144 stars @xcite rather than the higher masses usually associated with lbv outbursts . since we identify a significant population of fainter stars , this is unlikely to be a selection effect , and we conclude that these galaxies contain no analogs of @xmath0car .",
    "there are two ways we can interpret the result .",
    "first , we can ignore the existence of @xmath0car , and set @xmath145 .",
    "alternatively , we can acknowledge the existence of @xmath0car , in which case @xmath146 , since @xmath0car passes our selection criterion and mid - ir surveys of our galaxy for objects as luminous as @xmath0car are probably complete .",
    "for the first case , the 90% confidence upper limit is @xmath147 where the period over which such systems can be detected is scaled to @xmath148  years . for the second case , where we include @xmath0car , we find that @xmath149 with @xmath150 at 90% confidence . in either case ,",
    "the rate of transients comparable to @xmath0car is a small fraction of the supernova rate .",
    "stars as massive as @xmath0car are also rare , representing only @xmath151 to @xmath152 of all massive stars for a mass range from @xmath153/@xmath154 to @xmath155 . if every sufficiently massive star had one eruption , the results including @xmath0car correspond to a minimum mass of @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "if every star has an average of two eruptions , the mass limits rise to @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) . similarly the upper limit from ignoring the existence of @xmath0car corresponds to @xmath160 for an average of one eruption or @xmath161 for an average of two .",
    "@xcite estimated that the abundance of lower optical depth shells found at @xmath162 m around massive stars in the galaxy was roughly consistent with all stars more massive than @xmath163 having an average of two eruptions , corresponding to @xmath164 , which is consistent with the present results , but close to the upper limits .",
    "all the newly identified stars have luminosities within a narrow range of @xmath165-@xmath166 ( see figure[fig : dusty ] ) , which roughly corresponds to initial stellar masses of @xmath167-@xmath168 ( see section 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "local examples of evolved stars in this luminosity range are the yellow hypergiants ( yhgs ) such as irc@xmath2410420 , @xmath169cas and hr8752 @xcite , many of which are also partially obscured by dust ejecta .",
    "there is no means of cleanly surveying the galaxy for these objects and they are so rare that samples in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds do not provide good statistics for their abundances , life times or total mass loss .",
    "our well - defined sample of likely extragalactic analogs provides a means of addressing some of these questions .",
    "if we assume these objects are similar to stars like irc@xmath2410420 , their expansion velocities will be more like @xmath170  km / s than the @xmath171  km / s of the typical lbv shell .",
    "hence , it seems more appropriate to scale the results to @xmath172  years .",
    "this also matches the estimated age of the phase of dusty mass loss by irc@xmath2410420 @xcite . with 18 candidates",
    ", this detection period then leads to a median estimate that @xmath173 with @xmath174 .",
    "if we associate these with the mass range from @xmath175 to @xmath176 , they represent a fraction of @xmath177 of massive stars , so the average number of episodes per star , @xmath178 with a possible range of @xmath179 , although this does not include the uncertainties in @xmath125    figure[fig : hr_like ] shows that the median mass causing the obscuration is @xmath180 .",
    "the total mass lost in all the eruptions is then of order @xmath181 , which would be of order @xmath182-@xmath183 .",
    "this implies that the periods of optically thick ( dusty ) mass loss can not dominate the overall mass loss of the star . to make the mass lost in these phases dominate either requires that we have grossly overestimated @xmath117 , or that the mass range of the stars is much narrower .",
    "a related point is that these phases represent a negligible fraction of the post - main - sequence life times of the stars , at most lasting a few thousand years .",
    "in our survey , we have found no true analogs of @xmath0car .",
    "this implies that the rate of great eruption - like events is of order @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) of the ccsn rate , which is roughly consistent with each @xmath184 star undergoing 1 or 2 such outbursts in its lifetime .",
    "this is scaled by an estimated detection period of order @xmath185years .",
    "we do identify a significant population of lower luminosity dusty stars that that are likely similar to irc@xmath94 .",
    "stars enter this phase at the rate @xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) compared to the ccsn rate and for a detection period of @xmath172years . here",
    "the detection period is assumed longer because the expansion velocities are likely slower .",
    "this rate is comparable to having all stars with @xmath186 undergoing such a phase once or twice .    if the estimated detection periods and mass ranges are roughly correct , and our completeness is relatively high , there are two interesting implications for both populations .",
    "first , these high optical depth phases represent a negligible fraction of the post - main sequence lifetimes of these stars , at most lasting a few thousand years .",
    "this implies that these events have to be associated with special periods in the evolution of the stars .",
    "the number of such events a star experiences is also small , one or two , not ten or twenty .",
    "second , while a significant amount of mass is lost in the eruptions , they can not be a dominant contribution to mass loss .",
    "for these high mass stars , standard models ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) typically strip the stars of their hydrogen envelopes and beyond , implying total mass losses of all but the last @xmath187-@xmath188 .",
    "the median mass loss in figure[fig : hr_like ] is @xmath180 and if every star underwent two eruptions , the typical total would be @xmath189 .",
    "clearly there are some examples that require significantly larger @xmath88 , but we simply do not find enough heavily obscured stars for this phase to represent more than a modest fraction of the total mass loss ( @xmath12 not @xmath13 ) .    for the stars similar to irc@xmath2410420 , this is consistent with the picture that the photospheres of blue - ward evolving red super giants ( rsgs ) with @xmath190 and @xmath191-@xmath192  k , become moderately unstable , leading to periods of lower effective temperature and enhanced mass loss as the stars try to evolve into a `` prohibited '' region of the hr diagram that @xcite , @xcite and @xcite termed the `` yellow void '' . in this phase ,",
    "the stars lose enough mass to evolve into a hotter , less massive star on the blue side of the hr diagram .",
    "this is also the luminosity regime of the `` bistability jump '' in wind speeds driven by opacity changes which @xcite hypothesizes can explain the absence of lbvs and the existence of yhgs with high mass loss rates and dust formation ( @xcite ) in this luminosity range .",
    "in fact , @xcite propose that irc@xmath94 , which is identified by our selection criterion , is such a star .",
    "while these arguments supply a unique , short - lived evolutionary phase , there may be problems with the absolute scale of the mass loss , since estimates are that irc@xmath2410420 started with a mass of @xmath193 and has lost all but @xmath194 @xcite .",
    "the only other similarly unique phase in the lives of these stars is the final post - carbon ignition phase .",
    "there are now many examples of stars which have had outbursts shortly before exploding as supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and superluminous supernovae that are most easily explained by surrounding the star with a large amount of previously ejected mass @xcite . powering these supernovae requires mass ejected in the last years to decades of the stellar life ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "and it seems natural to associate these events with the mass ejections of lbvs like @xmath0car ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the statistical properties and masses of either of the classes of dusty stars we discuss are well - matched to the statistical requirements for explaining these interaction powered supernovae if the instability is associated with the onset of carbon burning ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if there is only one eruption mechanism , it must be associated with a relatively long period like carbon burning ( thousands of years ) rather than the shorter , later nuclear burning phases , because we observe many systems like @xmath0car that have survived far longer than these final phases last .",
    "if the mechanism for producing the ejecta around the superluminous supernovae is associated with nuclear burning phases beyond carbon , then we must have second eruption mechanism to explain @xmath0car or other still older lbvs surrounded by massive dusty shells .",
    "if there indeed are two mass loss mechanisms  one commencing @xmath195years from core - collapse and the other occurring in the @xmath196year prior to core - collapse  then the self - obscured stars identified in this work may very well be experiencing the earlier of these two mechanisms .",
    "otherwise , in a larger sample to @xmath197 such stars , one should be exploding as a ccsn every @xmath198 years .",
    "the dusty stars can be further characterized by their variability , which will help to follow the evolution of the dust . for the optically brighter examples",
    ", it may be possible to spectroscopically determine the stellar temperatures , although detailed study may only become possible with the james webb space telescope ( _ jwst _ ) .",
    "it is relatively easy to expand our survey to additional galaxies .",
    "for very luminous sources like @xmath0car analogs this is probably feasible to distance of @xmath199mpc , while for the lower luminosity irc@xmath2410420 analogs this is likely only feasible at the distances of the most distant galaxies in our sample ( @xmath200mpc ) .",
    "larger galaxy samples are needed not only to increase the sample of dusty luminous stars ( and hopefully find a true @xmath0 car analog ! ) , but also to have a sample with a larger number of supernovae , or equivalently a higher star formation rate .",
    "our estimate of the abundance of irc@xmath2410420 analogs is limited by the small number of ccsn ( @xmath201 ) in our sample more than by the number of dusty stars ( @xmath68 ) identified .",
    "finally , while we have shown that surveys for the stars are feasible using archival spitzer data , jwst will be a far more powerful probe of these stars .",
    "the hst - like resolution @xcite will be enormously useful to either greatly reduce the problem of confusion or to greatly expand the survey volume .",
    "far more important will be the ability to carry out the survey at @xmath162 m , which will increase the time over which dusty shells can be identified from hundreds of years to thousands of years , greatly improving the statistics and our ability to survey the long term evolution of these systems and the relationship between stellar eruptions and supernovae .",

    "<S> these phases constitute a negligible fraction of post - main sequence lifetimes of massive stars , which implies that these events are likely to be associated with special periods in the evolution of the stars . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the obscuring material is of order @xmath11 , and we simply do not find enough heavily obscured stars for theses phases to represent more than a modest fraction ( @xmath12 not @xmath13 ) of the total mass lost by these stars . in the long term , the sources that we identified will be prime candidates for detailed physical analysis with _ jwst_. </S>"
