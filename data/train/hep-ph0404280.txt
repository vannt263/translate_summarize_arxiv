    "the description of doubly heavy baryon properties acquires in the last years the status of actual physical problem which can be studied experimentally .",
    "the appearance of experimental data on @xmath3 mesons @xcite , heavy - light baryons @xcite stimulates the investigation of heavy quark bound states and can help in discriminating numerous quark models . recently",
    "first experimental indications of the existence of doubly charmed baryons were published by selex @xcite .",
    "although these data need further experimental confirmation and clarification it manifests that in the near future the mass spectra and decay rates of doubly heavy baryons will be measured .",
    "this gives additional grounds for the theoretical investigation of the doubly heavy baryon properties .",
    "the success of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite in predicting properties of the heavy - light @xmath4 mesons ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) suggests to apply these methods to heavy - light baryons , too .",
    "the semileptonic decays of heavy hadrons present also an important tool for determining the parameters of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "the relativistic quark model has been remarkably successful in describing the observed hadronic states and their decay rates @xcite .",
    "this includes the heavy - light mesons and heavy quarkonia .",
    "the quark model predicts the existence of doubly heavy baryons containing two heavy quarks ( @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath0 ) and one light quark ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the energies necessary to produce these particles are already reached .",
    "the main difficulty remains in their reconstruction since these states have in general a large number of decay modes and thus high statistics is required @xcite .",
    "doubly heavy baryons occupy a special position among existing baryons because they can be studied in the quark - diquark approximation and the two - particle bound state methods can be applied .",
    "the two heavy quarks compose in this case a bound diquark system in the antitriplet colour state which serves as a localized colour source .",
    "the light quark @xmath8 is orbiting around this heavy source at a distance much larger ( @xmath9 ) than the source size ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the estimates of the light quark velocity in these baryons show that its value is @xmath11 and the light quark should be treated fully relativistically .",
    "thus the doubly heavy baryons look effectively like a two - body bound system and strongly resemble the heavy - light @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons @xcite .",
    "then the hqet expansion in the inverse heavy diquark mass can be performed .",
    "we used a similar approach for the calculation of the mass spectra of doubly heavy baryons @xcite .",
    "the ground state baryons with two heavy quarks can be composed from a compact doubly heavy diquark of spin 0 or 1 and a light quark .",
    "according to the pauli principle the diquarks @xmath12 or @xmath13 have the spin 1 whereas diquark @xmath14 can have both the spin 0 and 1 .",
    "there exists already a number of papers devoted to studying both the mass spectra of doubly heavy baryons and their decay rates @xcite . whereas the results for the mass spectra are in agreement , the calculations of exclusive semileptonic decays lead to essentially different values for the decay rates @xcite obtained with the help of the bethe - salpeter equation , qcd sum rules and relativistic three quark model .",
    "here we study semileptonic decay rates of doubly heavy baryons using the relativistic quark model in the quark - diquark approximation .",
    "the covariant expressions for the semileptonic decay amplitudes of the baryons with the spin 1/2 , 3/2 are obtained in the limit @xmath15 and compared with the predictions of hqet .",
    "the calculation of semileptonic decays of doubly heavy baryons @xmath16 or @xmath17 to doubly heavy baryons @xmath17 or @xmath18 can be divided into two steps ( see fig .",
    "[ mdiag ] ) .",
    "the first step is the study of form factors of the weak transition between initial and final doubly heavy diquarks .",
    "the second one consists in the inclusion of the light quark in order to compose a baryon with spin 1/2 or 3/2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ rqm ] we describe our relativistic quark model and present predictions for the masses of ground state heavy diquarks and doubly heavy baryons .",
    "we apply our model to the investigation of the heavy diquark transition matrix elements in sec .",
    "the transition amplitudes of heavy diquarks are explicitly expressed in a covariant form through the overlap integrals of the diquark wave functions .",
    "the obtained general expressions reproduce in the appropriate limit the predictions of heavy quark symmetry .",

    "in the quasipotential approach and quark - diquark picture of doubly heavy baryons the interaction of two heavy quarks in a diquark and of the light quark with a heavy diquark in a baryon are described by the diquark wave function ( @xmath19 ) of the bound quark - quark state and by the baryon wave function ( @xmath20 ) of the bound quark - diquark state , respectively .",
    "these wave functions satisfy the two - particle quasipotential equation @xcite of the schrdinger type @xcite @xmath21 where the relativistic reduced mass is @xmath22 and the center of mass energies of particles on the mass shell @xmath23 , @xmath24 are given by @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the bound state mass ( diquark or baryon ) , @xmath27 are the masses of heavy quarks ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) which form the diquark or of the heavy diquark ( @xmath30 ) and light quark ( @xmath8 ) which form the doubly heavy baryon ( @xmath5 ) , and @xmath31 is their relative momentum . in the center of mass system",

    "( [ quas ] ) is the quasipotential operator of the quark - quark or quark - diquark interaction .",
    "it is constructed with the help of the off - mass - shell scattering amplitude , projected onto the positive energy states . here",
    "we closely follow the similar construction of the quark - antiquark interaction in heavy mesons which were extensively studied in our relativistic quark model @xcite .",
    "for the quark - quark interaction in a diquark we use the relation @xmath34 arising under the assumption about the octet structure of the interaction from the difference of the projection onto @xmath35 and @xmath36 colour states .",
    "the quasipotential of the quark - antiquark interaction is the sum of the usual one - gluon exchange term and the confining part which is the mixture of long - range vector and scalar linear potentials , where the vector confining potential contains the pauli terms .",

    "the quark masses have the following values @xmath37  gev , @xmath38 gev , @xmath39 gev , @xmath40 gev .",
    "we calculated in the framework of the relativistic quark model the mass spectra of heavy diquarks and doubly heavy baryon masses in the quark - diquark approximation in ref .",
    "the masses of the ground state axial vector diquarks were found to be @xmath41  gev , @xmath42  gev , @xmath43  gev , and the mass of the scalar diquark @xmath44  gev .",

    "in this paper we calculated the semileptonic decay rates of doubly heavy baryons in the quark - diquark approximation .",
    "the weak transition matrix elements between heavy diquark states were calculated with the self - consistent account of the spectator quark recoil .",
    "it was shown that recoil effects lead to the additional contributions to the transition matrix elements .",
    "such terms were missed in the previous quark model calculations .",
    "if we neglect these recoil contributions , the previously obtained expressions @xcite for heavy diquark transition matrix elements are reproduced .",
    "it was found that these recoil terms which are proportional to the ratio of the heavy spectator to the final active quark mass [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ssff])([eq : fw ] ) ] give important contributions to transition matrix elements of doubly heavy diquarks even in the nonrelativistic limit . in this limit",
    "these weak transition matrix elements are proportional to the function @xmath47 ( [ eq : ff ] ) which is expressed through the overlap integral of the heavy diquark wave functions .",
    "the function @xmath47 falls off rather rapidly , especially for @xmath48 diquark transition where the spectator quark is the @xmath49 quark ( see figs  [ ffbb ] , [ ffbc ] ) .",
    "such a decrease is the consequence of the large mass of the spectator quark and high recoil momenta ( @xmath50  gev ) transfered .",
    "we calculated the doubly heavy baryon transition matrix elements in the heavy diquark limit .",
    "the expressions for transition amplitudes and decay rates were obtained for the most general parameterization of the diquark transition matrix elements . the isgur - wise function @xmath51 ( [ eq : eta ] ) for the light quark ",
    "heavy diquark bound system was determined .",
    "this function is very similar to the isgur - wise function of the heavy - light meson in our model @xcite as it is required by the heavy quark symmetry . in the heavy quark limit",
    "the baryon transition matrix elements contain the common factor which is the product of the diquark form factor @xmath47 and the isgur - wise function @xmath51 .",
    "our results for the semileptonic decay rates of doubly heavy baryons @xmath52 and @xmath53 are compared with previous predictions in table  [ dhbdr ] .",
    "it is seen from this table that results of different approaches differ substantially .",
    "most of previous papers @xcite give their predictions only for selected decay modes .",
    "their values agree with our in the order of magnitude .",
    "our predictions are smaller than the qcd sum rule results @xcite by a factor of @xmath54 .",
    "this can be a result of our treatment of the heavy spectator quark recoil in the heavy diquark .",
    "on the other hand the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the bethe - salpeter equation is used , give more decay channels .",
    "their results are substantially higher than ours , for some decays the difference reaches almost two orders of magnitude which seems quite strange .",
    "e.g. , for the sum of the semileptonic decays @xmath55 ref .",
    "@xcite predicts @xmath56 which almost saturates the estimate of the total decay rate @xmath57 @xcite and thus is unlikely .",
    "all considerations in the present paper were done in the heavy quark limit .",
    "the calculations of the semileptonic decay rates of heavy mesons indicate that the @xmath58 corrections to the heavy quark limit ( especially @xmath59 ) are important @xcite . thus they can give sizeable contributions also to the semileptonic decay rates of doubly heavy baryons .",
