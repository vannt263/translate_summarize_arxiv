    "absorption lines in the spectra of high redshift qsos trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen along the lines of sight to the background sources . studying the properties of these intervening absorption systems",
    "can provide insights into a range of cosmic structures , ranging from the intergalactic medium to protogalaxies .",
    "the absorbers with the highest column densities give rise to lines with characteristic lorentzian profiles .",
    "specifically , damped   ( dla ) systems , defined as having  @xmath9 2 , dominate the mass density of hi in the universe and are believed to be associated with the progenitors of present day galaxies .",
    "studies of dlas have furnished a wealth of information about the density and chemical enrichment of galaxy - scale clouds of neutral hydrogen at early epochs ( see for example the reviews by pettini 2004 ; wolfe , gawiser & prochaska 2005 ) .",
    "nearly all existing studies of dlas have been confined to absorbers lying beyond a certain velocity from the systemic redshift of the qso ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the velocity cut imposed is somewhat subjective and survey dependent , but is usually 3000",
    " 6000  blueward of @xmath1 .",
    "the motivation for excluding proximate dlas ( @xmath6 , pdlas ) is two - fold .",
    "first , studies of the  forest have revealed the existence of a ` proximity effect ' , whereby the high uv flux from the qso causes additional ionisation of the diffuse hi clouds within a few mpc of the qso ( e.g. bajtlik , duncan & ostriker 1988 ; lu , wolfe & turnshek 1991 ) .",
    "even high column density systems whose interstellar media ( ism ) are usually considered to be self - shielded can be affected by proximity to a powerful ionising source such as a qso .",
    "for example , it has been noted that pdlas seem to preferentially exhibit  emission superimposed on the  absorption trough ( e.g. ellison et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , adelberger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have detected  fluorescence in a dla separated by 380 ( proper )   from a @xmath10 qso .",
    "excluding absorbers which may be affected by the qso s ionising radiation simplifies the calculations of its total hydrogen content and chemical abundances .",
    "second , studies concerned with the statistical properties of _ intervening _ galaxies could be affected by the inclusion of material associated with the qso . intrinsic absorption could , for example , be associated with bal - like outflows or with the qso host galaxy .",
    "however , the one @xmath11 pdla with measured metal abundances is known to have a metallicity @xmath12 15% of the solar value ( meyer , welty & york 1989 ; lu et al .",
    "this value is typical of intervening dlas but inconsistent with the typically solar or super - solar metallicities of bal - like outflows and intrinsic systems ( barlow & sargent 1997 ; petitjean , rauch & carswell 1994 ; dodorico et al .",
    "the pdlas also lack the strong civ or nv absorption and complex absorption profiles characteristic of bals ( see also m@xmath13ller , warren & fynbo 1998 ) . taken together",
    ", this evidence implies that pdlas are more likely to be related to gas associated with galaxies rather than agn .",
    "the differences in redshift between qsos and pdlas are typically too large for the absorbing material to be part of the qso host galaxy suggesting that pdlas may have an origin similar to the intervening systems , but are simply located closer to the qso .    in this paper",
    ", we consider whether there may be further justification for excluding pdlas from surveys by investigating whether they are drawn from the same ` random ' population as the intervening absorbers .",
    "it has been known for more than 30 years that qsos are often associated with galaxy evolution ( e.g. bahcall , schmidt & gunn 1969 ) so it is plausible that pdlas may represent a subset of early galaxies in a distinct environment .",
    "for example , it is well - established that overdensities of galaxies are often seen in the vicinity of qsos ( e.g. yee & green 1987 ; ellingson , green & yee 1991 ; yamada et al . 1997 ; hall & green 1998 ; hall , green & cohen 1998 ; sanchez & gonzalez - serrano 1999 ; mclure & dunlop 2001 ; wold et al .",
    "2001 ; finn , impey & hooper 2001 ; clements 2000 ; sanchez & gonzalez - serrano 2002 ) .",
    "our objective is therefore to determine whether dlas located at velocities @xmath14 6000  from the background qso may similarly inhabit distinct environments compared with intervening ` field ' absorbers . as a first approach ,",
    "we compare the number density of pdlas to that of traditionally selected @xmath15 dlas .",
    "a number density of pdlas consistent with that of intervening dlas would imply no distinction in their respective environments .",
    "conversely , an excess of dlas near the qso s systemic redshift could be interpreted as probing galaxy overdensities analogous to those found by imaging surveys .",
    "overdensities of pdlas would provide an empirically motivated cut - off for intervening dla searches whose goal is to study an unbiased sample of absorbers .",
    "since the majority of dla surveys exclude pdlas , constructing a statistical sample from the literature is challenging .",
    "a handful of pdlas have been reported ( e.g. m@xmath13ller & warren 1993 ; pettini et al .",
    "1995 ; m@xmath13ller et al .",
    "1998 ; ellison et al . 2002 ) but they have not been generally included in published lists of dlas .",
    "recently , ellison et al . (",
    "2002 ) searched for pdlas in the complete optical and radio absorption line system ( corals ) sample ( see ellison et al .",
    "2001 for full sample definition ) . combining their sample with pdlas discovered in previous surveys of radio loud and radio quiet qsos ( rlqs and rqqs respectively )",
    "ellison et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found 4 pdlas within @xmath16v @xmath14 3000  of 96 radio - loud qsos , and just 1 within @xmath16v @xmath14 3000  of 49 radio - quiet qsos ( proux et al . 2001 ) .",
    "given the redshift path ( @xmath17 ) covered by the rqq sample , the detection of one pdla is consistent with the known number density per unit redshift ( @xmath5 ) of intervening absorbers .",
    "however , the detection of four pdlas associated with rlqs implies that the number density of pdlas is @xmath18 4 times that of the intervening population .",
    "this apparent overdensity around rlqs at @xmath19 is significant only at the 1.5 @xmath7 level due to the relatively small number of qsos , and ellison et al .",
    "( 2002 ) noted that better statistics are required to confirm the overdensity .    with the advent of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    ", the spectra of large numbers of qsos ( @xmath12 10@xmath20 , eventually ) are becoming available . here",
    "we search for pdlas in the spectra of 731 qsos with apparent magnitude @xmath21 from the sdss data release 3 ( dr3 , abazajian et al .",
    "2005 ) , in order to answer the following two questions :    * is the density of dlas in the vicinity of qsos significantly higher than that along the line of sight ?",
    "* do the environments of radio - quiet and radio - loud qsos differ ?",
    "this work improves on that of ellison et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in several ways .",
    "first , our sample is an order of magnitude larger than the corals survey . with these improved statistics we can investigate the number density in a range of velocity bins from @xmath1 . since the data quality of the sdss spectra is somewhat heterogeneous ,",
    "we have carried out completeness tests for our sample ; these are described in  3 .",
    "finally , we use a monte carlo simulation to assess the significance of the measured overdensity of pdlas relative to intervening systems .",
    "we have adopted the ` consensus ' cosmology model with @xmath22  mpc@xmath23 , @xmath24 = 0.7 , @xmath25 = 0.3 .",

    "however , velocity distributions of galaxies within individual clusters at z@xmath120 are typically @xmath12 1000 , so the apparent overdensities found here ( @xmath80 6000 ) imply structure on supercluster scales . calculating the physical distance between qsos and pdlas is not straightforward , particularly if both are located in a large mass potential where peculiar velocities dominate .",
    "we can only calculate the line of sight separations under the assumption that the velocities are driven by the hubble flow . in this case ( which of course is not valid",
    "if the overdensities are linked to clustering ) we find qso - pdla separations up to 70 comoving mpc .",
    "many authors have reported galaxy clustering around qsos on scales of a few comoving mpc ( e.g. schting , clowes & campusano 2004 and references therein ) whilst qsos themselves seem to cluster over similar distances ( croom et al .",

    "the pdla value is @xmath1250% larger than for the intervening systems , but also is consistent within the large error bars with the dla value . if the higher @xmath109 for pdlas is confirmed , this may simply reflect the excess of the number density , @xmath5 , if the distribution of column densities of neutral hydrogen are similar .",
    "however , since @xmath109 is dominated by the rare high systems , the gas mass density is very sensitive to small sample sizes .",
    "we have 33 pdlas in our sample , whereas each of the @xmath19 sdss bins typically contains 100  200 dlas .",
    "if we exclude our highest column density system from the calculation , @xmath109 for pdlas is in excellent agreement with the intervening systems .",
    "similarly , if we include a further high-  system , @xmath109 for pdlas is @xmath12 twice that of the intervening dlas , a result consistent with the observed excess of proximate dlas and similar sample average .",
    "our definition of pdlas is based on relatively small velocity offsets , which in turn are dependent upon accurate systemic redshifts .",

    "<S> we present a sample of 33 damped lyman alpha systems ( dlas ) discovered in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) whose absorption redshifts ( @xmath0 ) are within 6000  of the qso s systemic redshift ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our sample is based on 731 @xmath2 4.5 non - broad - absorption - line ( non - bal ) qsos from data release 3 ( dr3 ) of the sdss . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that our search is @xmath3100% complete for absorbers with  @xmath4 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the derived number density of dlas per unit redshift , @xmath5 , within @xmath6  is higher ( 3.5 @xmath7 significance ) by almost a factor of 2 than that of intervening absorbers observed in the sdss dr3 , i.e. there is evidence for an overdensity of galaxies near the qsos . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a physical motivation for excluding dlas at small velocity separations in surveys of intervening ` field ' dlas . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that the overdensity of proximate dlas is independent of the radio - loudness of the qso , consistent with the environments of radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos being similar .    </S>",
