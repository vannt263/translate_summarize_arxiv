    "since the success of trapping cold atoms via optical trap,@xcite the study of condensates of atoms with nonzero spin is a hot topic .",
    "there are numerous literatures dedicated to the study of the ground state ( g.s . ) . for spin-2 condensates , the g.s . was found to have three phases , namely , the ferro - phase , polar phase and cyclic phase , depending on the features of the interaction.@xcite on the other hand , it has been revealed that the total hamiltonian of the spin-2 systems is associated with the @xmath7 symmetry.@xcite since there are elegant theory dealing with this symmetry , it is worthy to derive a generalized gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation adapted to the @xmath0 symmetry . since the solutions of this equation could provide the details of the low - lying states , we believe that the understanding to the spin-2 condensates could be thereby enriched .",
    "we consider the case that the magnetic field @xmath8 . the symmetry - adapted gp equation is derived firstly .",
    "then , by solving the gp equation , both the spin - textiles and the spatial wave functions of the low - lying states can be known .",
    "the emphasis is placed on the g.s .. since the stability of the g.s .",
    "is affected by its environment , in addition to the g.s .",
    "itself , special effort is made to study the environment , namely , the width of the gap ( the energy difference between the first excited state and the g.s . ) and the level - density in the neighborhood of the g.s .. this is a topic less studied before . besides , the degeneracy of the g.s .",
    "is an important feature which is also studied in this paper . the total magnetization @xmath3 is considered as being conserved , which depends on how the system is experimentally prepared .",
    "the influence of @xmath3 on the spin - textiles and the degeneracy of the g.s . is found to be great .    after we have obtained the spatial wave functions , physical quantities related to the spatial degrees of freedom",
    "can be known . in particular , we have calculated the root mean square radius @xmath5 . since @xmath5 is an",
    "observable , theoretical results and experimental data can be compared with each other .",
    "this is a notable way to check the theory .",
    "the gp equation will be firstly solved analytically under the thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa ) .",
    "a number of formulae relating the physical quantities have been thereby obtained , and the underlying physics can be understood in an analytical way .",
    "then , strict numerical calculations are performed to check the validity of the tfa .",
    "a condensate with @xmath1 spin-2 neutral atoms trapped by an isotropic harmonic potential @xmath9 is considered , in which the spin - orbit coupling is assumed to be weak . it is further assumed that the trap is not so weak ( say , @xmath10 ) and the spin - dependent interaction is weak so that the spin - modes are much lower than and separated from the spatially excited modes .",
    "this is the basic assumption of this paper . in other words ,",
    "the following results hold only for the systems adapted to this assumption . in this case",
    "a group of excited states distinct in their spin - modes would emerge in the neighborhood of the g.s .. in each of these states ( including the g.s . )",
    "all the particles have a common spatial wave function which is most advantageous to binding and adapted to a specific spin - textile .",
    "thus one of these states with a specific spin - mode @xmath11 can be in general written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the common spatial wave function and @xmath14 is a total spin - state which is now unknown .",
    "if the particles did not fall into the same state but have some of them getting excited , the total energy would be thereby higher .",
    "the group @xmath15 totally form a band which is called the ground band .",
    "the states not in the ground band will contain various spatially excited modes and will not be studied in this paper .",
    "when @xmath16 and @xmath17 are used as units for energy and length ( where @xmath18 is the mass and is given at the one of @xmath19rb ) , the total hamiltonian is @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 is the spin - state of the @xmath25-th particle , and the two spins of @xmath25 and @xmath26 are coupled to the combined spin @xmath27 and its z - component @xmath28 , @xmath29 , 2 , or 4 .",
    "obviously , @xmath30 is the projector onto the @xmath27-channel .",
    "@xmath31 is the strength related to the scattering length of the @xmath27-channel .",
    "we introduce an operator defined in the total spin - space as @xmath32 .",
    "it has been proved that @xmath33 is a linear combination of a set of casimir operators belonging to a chain of nested algebra as @xmath0.@xcite consequently , the eigenstates and the eigenenergies of @xmath33 can be exactly known as @xmath34 now , @xmath11 represents a group of quantum numbers @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath3 , where @xmath37 and @xmath3 are the total spin and its @xmath38-component , @xmath39 and @xmath36 will be explained below , and @xmath40 is the related eigenstate . for convenience , @xmath41 is assumed .",
    "when two spins are coupled to zero , they form a singlet pair @xmath42 .",
    "when three spins are coupled to zero , they form a triplet and can be approximately denoted as @xmath43 ( this notation is exact when @xmath44).@xcite in the triplet every pair of spins are coupled to 2 .",
    "it turns out that the singlet pair and triplet are basic building blocks .",
    "an eigenstate may contain @xmath45 singlet pairs and @xmath36 triplets . the quantum number @xmath46 is named the seniority , which is the number of particles not in the singlet pairs . the number of particles neither in the pairs nor the triplets is @xmath47 , the total spin @xmath37 is contributed by them .",
    "it has been proved that , when @xmath45 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath3 are given , the totally - symmetric eigenstate @xmath48 is unique .",
    "the four quantum numbers are bound by the following conditions : ( i ) @xmath49 , ( ii ) @xmath50 , ( iii ) @xmath51 is not allowed , and of course ( iv ) @xmath52.@xcite    let us define @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "then , the eigenenergy associated with @xmath14 is @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "note that @xmath61 does not depend on @xmath36 implying that the levels might be degenerate as shown below.@xcite    inserting eq.([1 ] ) into the schrdinger equation , we have @xmath62 where the integration covers all the degrees of freedom except @xmath63 . from this equation and making use of eq.(3 ) , it is straight forward to obtain the symmetry - adapted gp equation for the normalized @xmath64 as @xmath65   \\phi_{\\gamma }    =   0 ,   \\label{6}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the chemical potential . after solving eq.(6 )",
    "we can obtain the total energy @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the total interaction energy .",
    "the whole spectrum of the ground band can be obtained from the set @xmath69 .",
    "obviously , this equation is a generalization of the one for spin-1 condensates given in ref.@xcite it is also a more accurate version for the one given as eq.(74 ) in ref.@xcite , in which the spin - dependent interaction has been neglected .",
    "since @xmath1 is usually large , eq.(6 ) can be solved by using the tfa . neglecting the kinetic term in eq.(6 ) ,",
    "when @xmath16 and @xmath70 are used as units , the normalized tfa solution is @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the tf - radius . from this solution",
    "we can obtain the root mean square radius @xmath74 , and the total energy @xmath75 thus , the total energy is directly related to the size ( measured by @xmath5 ) .    when @xmath1 is large , we know from eq.(4 ) that @xmath61 is proportional to @xmath76 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "thus the size increases with @xmath1 very slowly , but @xmath79 increases with @xmath1 faster than linearly .    on the other hand , it is noted that , in the units of @xmath16 and @xmath70 , all the strengths @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the magnitude of @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath82 . therefore @xmath83 .",
    "when @xmath6-independent units are used , the size is described by @xmath84 , i.e. , a stronger trap leads to a smaller size .",
    "similarly , one can prove that the chemical potential @xmath85 , and the total energy @xmath86 . thus the total energy will increase with @xmath87  a little faster than linearly .",
    "it is obvious from eq.(4 ) that which pair of @xmath35 and @xmath37 is more advantageous to binding depends on the competition between @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which depend on @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and they are considered as variable .",
    "therefore , we introduce a variable parameter @xmath4 to manifest the competition . in the units of @xmath16 and @xmath70 ,",
    "the strengths are assumed as @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 ( for a comparison , the realistic strengths for @xmath19rb are @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 ) .",
    "in fact , it has been shown previously that the phase of the g.s .",
    "depends on @xmath4.@xcite    under the tfa , the ground state energy @xmath99 is just the lowest @xmath79 given by eqs.(8 ) and ( 4 ) . although @xmath79 does not directly depend on @xmath3 , the condition @xmath100 restricts the possible choice of @xmath37 , and @xmath99 is thereby affected .",
    "@xmath99 versus @xmath4 with @xmath3 given at five values are shown in fig.1 .",
    "there are two critical points @xmath101 and @xmath102.@xcite when @xmath4 goes through either @xmath103 or @xmath104 a phase transition will occur .",
    "this phenomenon was found as early as in 2000 by using the mean field theory ( in which @xmath105 and the same @xmath104 were found.@xcite the present more accurate result will tend to the old one when @xmath1 is large ) .    when @xmath4 is in @xmath106 , i.e. , in region",
    "- i , the g.s .",
    "does not depend on @xmath3 and will have @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the degeneracy of the state . since all the spins align along a common direction in this g.s .",
    ", it is in the ferro - phase.@xcite    when @xmath4 is in @xmath109 , i.e. , in region - ii , the g.s . depends on @xmath3 and will have @xmath110 . since @xmath111 and @xmath112 , all the @xmath113 unpaired spins must align along a common direction so that the total spin can be maximized ( i.e. , @xmath37 can be equal @xmath3 ) . thus each g.s . in region - ii",
    "is a mixture of a group of aligned spins together with the @xmath114 singlet pairs , namely , a mixture of ferro - phase and polar phase . when @xmath115 , @xmath116 , thus it is in pure polar phase ( we have assumed that @xmath1 is even , otherwise @xmath117 ) .",
    "when @xmath3 is larger , more spins are in the ferro - phase , and accordingly @xmath99 gets higher as shown in the figure . when @xmath118 , @xmath107 , and the g.s .",
    "is in pure ferro - phase .    when @xmath4 is in @xmath119 , i.e. , in region - iii , the g.s . depends also on @xmath3 and has @xmath120 .",
    "note that these g.s .",
    "have @xmath121 , therefore they do not contain any singlet pairs , but the spins in triplets are allowed .",
    "it is recalled that , in regions i and ii , the g.s . has @xmath122 .",
    "it implies that all the unpaired spins must be aligned , and therefore there is no room for the triplets . whereas in iii",
    ", the number of triplets @xmath36 can have different choices in a specific domain under the constraints of symmetry given in points ( i ) to ( iv ) in the paragraph above eq.(4 ) ( while those spins not in the triplets are coupled to @xmath112 ) .",
    "this leads to the degeneracy of the g.s.@xcite when @xmath115 the g.s .",
    "has @xmath123 and therefore @xmath124 ( point ( ii ) ) .",
    "thus , all the particles are in the triplets ( i.e. , in a pure cyclic phase ) , and henceforth @xmath125 ( we have assumed that @xmath1 is a multiple of 3 to simplify the discussion ) . when @xmath118 , the g.s .",
    "has @xmath126 and therefore @xmath127 .",
    "thus , neither the pairs nor the triplets emerge ( i.e. , in a pure ferro - phase ) , and henceforth @xmath125 also .",
    "when @xmath3 is neither 0 nor @xmath128 , the g.s .",
    "is in general degenerate .",
    "in particular , when @xmath129 , @xmath130 can be ranged from @xmath113 to @xmath3 ( each step is 3 ) . in this case",
    "the degeneracy @xmath108 is maximized ( the curve `` 3 '' in iii has @xmath131 ) .",
    "the appearance of highly degenerate g.s . in the region",
    "iii is a notable feature .",
    "it is reminded that the polar phase is composed of @xmath29 pairs .",
    "therefore , when @xmath132 is less positive than @xmath133 and @xmath134 , the g.s . will prefer this phase . the cyclic phase is composed of @xmath29 triplets in which every pair of spins must be coupled to @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath133 is less positive , the g.s . will prefer this phase .",
    "while the ferro - phase is composed of aligned spins , in which every two must be coupled to @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath134 is less positive , the g.s . will prefer this phase .",
    "thus the phase transitions manifested above reflects the competition of the interactions of the three @xmath27-channels .",
    "the competition depends on @xmath3 because the least number of spins that must be aligned is determined by @xmath3 .    when @xmath118 is given , the ferro - phase is the only choice disregarding how the interaction is as shown by the uppermost curve in fig.1 .",
    "when @xmath1 is sufficiently large the terms @xmath137 can be neglected , then we have @xmath138       u(\\tilde{\\omega})^{1/2}.   \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this formula we know that @xmath61 has a minimum at @xmath139 and a maximum at @xmath140 where @xmath141 .",
    "since the total energy is proportional to @xmath142 as shown in eq.(8 ) , with @xmath143 and our parameters , the minimum at @xmath139 has @xmath144 , and the maximum at @xmath140 has @xmath145 .",
    "this explains the origin of the dip and the highest peak in fig.1 .    since the root mean square radius is an observable , it is desirable to study @xmath5 so that the theory can be checked via experimental measurement .",
    "according to eq.(7 ) , @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath146 , thus the variation of @xmath5 versus @xmath4 with the minimum and maximum is predicted . in particular , when @xmath139 ( @xmath147 ) and the unit @xmath70 is replaced by @xmath148 , the minimum ( maximum ) in fig.1 is associated with @xmath149 ( 3.81 ) @xmath148 . in region",
    "ii and iii , it is predicted that the increase of @xmath3 would lead to the increase of the size .",
    "this is also a point to be checked .",
    "it is believed that the stability of the g.s . is assured by the gap @xmath150 ,",
    "namely , the energy difference between the first excited state and the g.s .. the former has its @xmath151 slightly different from that of the g.s . , @xmath152 , and",
    "can be easily obtained from eq.(4 ) .",
    "an example of @xmath150 is shown in fig.2 .",
    "note that when @xmath118 , @xmath153 is the only choice , no choice other than @xmath154 is allowed .",
    "thus , under @xmath3-conservation , there are no excited spin - modes .",
    "hence , in order to show the gap for a very large @xmath3 , the curve `` 5 '' in fig.2 is not given as @xmath118 but @xmath155 .",
    "fig.2 has the following features :    \\(i ) since eq.(4 ) manifests that the energy is nearly @xmath156 and @xmath157 , the gap would be in general large if both @xmath158 and @xmath159 are large . in this case",
    ", a small deviation in @xmath151 will cause a great change in energy . whereas if one of them is zero , the gap would be much lower . in region",
    "i the g.s .",
    "is in the ferro - phase with @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , the gap is very high and accordingly _ the g.s .",
    "is very stable in the ferro - phase_. in ii and iii , the upmost curve in fig.2 has @xmath155 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , respectively . since they are also large , the gap is also high . when @xmath155 , the g.s .",
    "is very close to be in ferro - phase and therefore is stable .",
    "however , when @xmath3 decreases , the stability reduces . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath115 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 in ii and iii , respectively . in this case",
    "@xmath165 was found in both ii and iii as shown by the lowest curve in fig.2 .",
    "thus _ the g.s . in polar and cyclic phases with a small _ @xmath3 _ are highly unstable_.    \\(ii ) @xmath150 in every region appears as a peak , namely , in the middle part it is higher but very low when @xmath4 is close to the borders . for fig.2 the g.s . in i",
    "has @xmath153 , while the first excited state has @xmath166 if @xmath167 .",
    "thus the excitation from @xmath154 to @xmath168 is caused by a change in @xmath37 .",
    "however , when @xmath169 , accordingly @xmath170 .",
    "therefore the gap is zero . on the other hand",
    ", the first excited state has @xmath171 when ( @xmath172 ) . from eq.(4 ) , we know the gap @xmath173 .",
    "\\label{10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can prove that  the gap is zero when @xmath174 . since @xmath175 is extremely close to @xmath176 , this explains the decline of the gap when @xmath177 .",
    "based on eq.(4 ) , the decline of the peak in ii and iii can be similarly explained .",
    "thus , _ in the neighborhoods of the borders , the g.s . is highly unstable .",
    "_    in addition to the gap , another factor that could affect the stability of the g.s .",
    "is the level density in the neighborhood of the lowest level .",
    "this density can be calculated based on eq.(8 ) . as an example , the number of levels with excitation energy @xmath178 is given in table [ tab:1 ] , in which seven choices of @xmath4 and four choices of @xmath3 are chosen .",
    "the other parameters are the same as in fig.1 .",
    "if the degeneracy of a level is @xmath108 , then the number contributed by this level is @xmath108 .",
    ".the number of levels lower than @xmath179 versus @xmath3 and @xmath4 . @xmath103 and",
    "@xmath104 denote the borders , @xmath180 .",
    "the first column gives the region of @xmath4 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     furthermore , the size of the system is expected to increase by including the kinetic energy .",
    "the results from the numerical calculation are shown in table [ tab:2 ] , where the @xmath5 from tfa are given inside the parentheses and are smaller . from the table we know that the tfa leads to a @xmath181 reduction of the @xmath5 ( if @xmath182 ) , or a @xmath183 reduction of the @xmath5 ( if @xmath143 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the two features found previously under the tfa remain unchanged , namely , ( i ) when the g.s .",
    "is not in the ferro - phase , a larger @xmath3 leads to a larger size .",
    "( ii ) when the g.s .",
    "is in the ferro - phase ( @xmath184 or @xmath118 ) , the size is minimized when @xmath139 and is maximized when @xmath140 .",
    "it has been predicted based on the tfa that @xmath185 . to check this relation @xmath186 from the numerical solutions",
    "are plotted in fig.3 versus @xmath187 . in 3a",
    "to 3c the curves are not exactly straight lines .",
    "their slopes depend on @xmath1 and are plotted in 3d to 3f , respectively . disregarding @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "the slopes tend to @xmath188 when @xmath1 increases as predicted .",
    "it has been predicted based on the tfa that @xmath189 . to check this relation @xmath186 from the numerical solutions",
    "are plotted in fig.4 versus @xmath190 .",
    "the slopes of the curves tend to @xmath191 when @xmath81 increases as predicted .",
