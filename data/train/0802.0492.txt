    "at the turn of the millennium , precise agreement between the observed oscillation spectrum of the sun and predictions of theoretical solar models , built using the best abundance assessments of the day @xcite , represented a triumph of modern astrophysics ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this illustrious accord has recently been clouded by sophisticated re - assessments of the solar complement of light elements based on 3-d non - lte hydrodynamic photospheric modelling : such models demand less of the elements c , n , o and ne that are important for the opacity of the solar interior by 25 - 35  %  compared to earlier assessments @xcite .",
    "solar models employing this chemical composition lead to predictions of the depth of the convection zone , helium abundance , density and sound speed in serious disagreement with helioseismology measurements @xcite .",
    "this state of affairs is now commonly referred to as the `` solar model problem '' , or the `` solar oxygen crisis '' ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "to solve this problem , @xcite and @xcite suggested the uncertain solar ne abundance might be raised to compensate for lower c , n and o abundances .",
    "@xcite found empirical support for this in _ chandra _ high resolution x - ray spectra of mostly magnetically active stars for which the ne / o abundance ratio appears consistently higher by a factor of @xmath7 or more than the currently recommended solar value of ne / o=0.15 by number .",
    "they argued that existing solar coronal ne / o measurements supporting the latter ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might be biased by chemical fractionation .",
    "however , subsequent studies of the helioseismology data using different theoretical models disagree as to the viability of such a solution @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the suggested downward c , n and o abundance revisions are unwarranted . @xcite",
    "favour the @xcite value of o / h@xmath8 based on multi - component atmospheric modelling and analysis of co lines . however , a very recent 3d empirical study of spatially - resolved spectropolarimetric observation of fe  i and o  i lines by @xcite finds o / h@xmath9 , in good agreement with @xcite .    the difficulty in determining the solar o abundance lies in the complexity of the non - local thermodynamic equilibrium optically - thick line formation problem in the inhomogeneous and turbulent photosphere . in this paper",
    ", we study a possible alternative approach .",
    "@xcite recently investigated the utility of the weak photospheric k@xmath0 fluorescence line of neutral ne excited by coronal x - ray photoionisation as an independent abundance diagnostic . here",
    ", we turn our attention to the o  k@xmath0 line at 23.37    ( 530.6  kev ) .",
    "in contrast to the complex photospheric absorption line formation problem , the formation of the x - ray fluorescent o  k@xmath0 line is relatively simple , depending only on the geometry of the overlying coronal source of irradiation and the heliocentric angle of the photospheric region in question ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we present monte carlo calculations of the fluorescent o  k@xmath0 line in  2 , and address its potential as an abundance diagnostic in  3 and  4 .",
    "we adopt the same computational methods described in earlier work on fe and ne fluorescence lines , and the reader is referred to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) for details .",
    "a brief summary is provided below .",
    "x - ray `` characteristic '' ( fluorescence ) k@xmath0 lines correspond to the @xmath10 decay of the excited state resulting from ejection of an inner - shell @xmath11 electron in the neutral ( or near - neutral ) atom by either electron impact or photoionisation . in the case of solar and stellar photospheric fluorescent lines , the former is expected to dominate @xcite . for a given coronal x - ray source spectrum ,",
    "@xmath12 , the observed flux of k@xmath0 photons from the photosphere then depends on the photospheric abundance @xmath13 of the fluorescing species relative to that of other elements of significance for the photoabsorption opacity in the vicinity of the @xmath11 ionisation edge ; the height @xmath14 of the emitting source ; and the heliocentric angle @xmath15 between the emitting source and the observer @xcite .",
    "fluorescent lines are formed in the region of the atmosphere corresponding to optical depth of approximately unity for the primary k - shell ionising photons . in the case of o , for normal incidence",
    "the solar atmospheric model c ( valc ) of @xcite reaches the k - shell photoabsorption @xmath16 depth slightly above the temperature minimum , at a gas temperature of about 5600  k and about 800  km above the point where the continuum optical depth at 5000   , @xmath17 , is unity .",
    "the expected intensity of the emergent o  k@xmath0 line was computed using a modified version of the 3d monte carlo radiative transfer code mocassin ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also paper i for a specific description of fluorescence calculations ) .",
    "this code follows energy packets representing incident x - ray photons as they interact with the photospheric gas through photoelectric absorption or scattering events until the packets escape .",
    "o  k@xmath0 packets are produced following k - shell x - ray absorption with a probability dictated by the k@xmath0 fluorescent yield for oxygen : these packets are followed in the same fashion .",
    "we adopted a value of @xmath18 for the fluorescence yield of neutral oxygen @xcite .",
    "coronal spectra used for the incident x - ray radiation field were computed using emissivities from the chianti database @xcite and the ion populations of @xcite , as implemented in the pintofale idl suite of programs @xcite .    for a given coronal x - ray spectrum ,",
    "the maximum intensity of a fluorescent line is achieved for a heliocentric angle @xmath19 and height @xmath20 . as in the case of the earlier study of ne , since we are primarily interested here in the observability of the fluorescent line , we adopt @xmath19 and @xmath20 as baseline parameters , these values yielding the maximum possible line strength .",
    "the wavelength of the o  k@xmath0 doublet has not been determined with high precision and we adopted the value @xmath21   , corresponding to the mean of values found for the energy level of the excited @xmath222p^4\\,^4p$ ] of @xmath23  ev from laboratory measurements by @xcite , @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also the review by @xcite ) .",
    "this wavelength is in good agreement with the position of the @xmath242p^4\\,^4p$ ] resonance seen in absorption in the interstellar medium toward bright x - ray continuum sources by @xcite .",
    "the o  k@xmath0 flux was computed for isothermal irradiating",
    "coronal spectra with plasma temperatures in the range @xmath25-@xmath26  k and coronal and photospheric chemical compositions of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gs ; with o / h=8.83 on the usual log+12 scale ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* o / h=8.66 ) .",
    "as noted in  1 , these two chemical mixtures differ not only in o abundance but also , primarily , in c , n and ne abundances : these differences turn out to be important for the o fluorescent line and are discussed in more detail below . to investigate changes in the o abundance only , we also performed calculations using a photospheric composition corresponding to the gs abundance mixture with o elevated and decreased by a factor of 2 ( o / h=9.13,8.53 , or [ o / h]=@xmath27 ) .",
    "the photospheric o  k@xmath0 fluorescent line is shown in comparison with the direct coronal spectrum for the case of gs abundances for both coronal spectrum and photosphere in figure  [ f : spectra ] for the range of coronal plasma temperatures @xmath28 .",
    "the lower panel illustrates the same spectra seen at a resolving power of @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is assumed to be the full - width at half - maximum of a gaussian instrument response function . unlike the ne  k@xmath0 line ,",
    "the o  k@xmath0 transition forms in a relatively uncrowded spectral region and the chianti database predicts no devastatingly large blends in the immediate vicinity of 23.37   . for temperatures approaching @xmath26",
    "k , a line of fe  xxiii at 23.36    appears , but for gs abundances is always dominated by the o  k@xmath0 line by a factor of 10 .",
    "lying redward of our adopted line centre is ca  xv  @xmath31 , which peaks at slightly cooler temperatures ( @xmath32 ) at an intensity of about 30  %  of that of o  k@xmath0 .    the full list of lines in the chianti database within @xmath33 of the o  k@xmath0 wavelength range ( @xmath34    from @xmath35   ) with intensities @xmath36 times that of the brightest line ( fe  xxiii  @xmath37 ) are listed in table  [ t:5sigma ] . the nist atomic spectra database ( version 3.1.2 ; @xcite ) also lists two other transitions within the @xmath33 range from ti  xiii and sc  xiv .",
    "neither of these are expected to be of any significance since their solar abundances according to the gs assessment are 300 and 21000 lower than that of fe , respectively .",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) of the o  k@xmath0 line relative to coronal fluorescing spectra with gs abundances is illustrated in figure  [ f : ew ] for a range of isothermal plasma temperatures and different photospheric o abundances .",
    "the monte carlo sampling error on the computed ews is estimated to be no larger than 7% .",
    "one striking feature of the trend of ew with @xmath38 for all compositions is the sharp decline with rising temperature for @xmath39 : this contrasts with both ne  k@xmath0 and fe  k@xmath0 , whose ews exhibit a steady , monotonic rise with increasing @xmath38 ( papers  i & ii ) , corresponding to a commensurate increase in the number of ionising photons .",
    "the different behaviour of o  k@xmath0 arises because , for coronal plasmas with @xmath39 and solar composition , k - shell photoionisation of oxygen is due mostly to line rather than continuum radiation . toward hotter temperatures ,",
    "the important line - emitting photoionising species , including o  vii and o  viii , become ionised , and continuum contributions begin to dominate .",
    "regarding sensitivity to o abundance , figure  [ f : ew ] illustrates that the ew changes by a smaller factor than expected based on a proportional relation with the photospheric the o abundance . as discussed by @xcite and in paper",
    "i , this is a result of the the o  k - shell photoionisation cross - section being a significant component of the total opacity near threshold : for very large o abundances where o begins to dominate the opacity , the ew will tend to a constant value dictated simply by equipartition of ionising photons between o k- and l - shells .",
    "nevertheless , for `` normal '' ranges of o abundance the o  k@xmath0 line variations are significant : we find typical changes of 35 - 60%  over the full range of coronal temperatures for o abundance variations of a factor of 2 .    when the other abundant light elements c and n are allowed to scale with the o abundance the diagnostic fares slightly less well but does provide discrimination between the photospheric compositions of gs and @xcite .",
    "the @xcite o abundance is 48%  lower than that of gs , and the o  k@xmath0 ews differ by 20 - 25% . for a given exciting x - ray spectrum , changes in fluorescent line strength with different photospheric parameters depend on changes in the _ fraction of ionising photons that ionise the parent shell _ of the fluorescent line in question . for a solar composition , two other sources of opacity in the vicinity of the o edge",
    "are c and n. the chemical compositions of gs and @xcite differ by @xmath40%  in o / c and o / n ratios , and the lockstep changes in these elements that dilutes the effect of the different o abundances relative to h on the o  k@xmath0 ew . despite this slightly lower sensitivity of the fluorescent line to the global chemical composition , accurate measurements of the o  k@xmath0 ews still potentially provide a new and relatively direct means of assessing the veracity of the gs and @xcite mixtures .",
    "the line ew is also sensitive to the abundances adopted for the exciting coronal spectrum .",
    "this is due to the large contribution of the o  vii he - like complex to the source of ionising photons for coronal temperatures @xmath41 . to a lesser extent ,",
    "fe l - shell and ne , mg and si h - like and he - like lines also make a contribution for temperatures up to @xmath42 .",
    "we have examined the sensitivity to coronal abundances by comparison of o  k@xmath0 line ews computed for coronal spectra generated using gs and @xcite compositions , as illustrated in figure  [ f : ew ] .",
    "the former are higher than the latter by an amount that decreases from 25 - 30%  for temperatures",
    "@xmath43 where the o  vii lines dominate , to @xmath44%  at @xmath457.0",
    ". differences at higher temperatures are largely due to the lower ne , mg , si and fe abundances in the @xcite composition ( by 74 , 12 , 10 and 55% respectively ) .",
    "in addition to uncertainties in the solar o content , coronal abundance variations are also expected as a result of chemical fractionation , in which the abundances of elements with low first ionisation potentials are seen to differ from photospheric values by factors of up to @xmath46 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in this context , we emphasise that in a practical application of the fluorescence technique the photospheric abundance would be deduced by comparing the model fluorescent ews computed for different photospheric abundances and the _ simultaneously observed _ coronal spectrum , and knowledge of the actual coronal composition is not required .      as discussed in paper  ii in the context of ne fluorescence ,",
    "existing solar spectra generally have insufficient sensitivity to detect these relatively weak lines .",
    "while the o  k@xmath0 line is expected to be an order of magnitude stronger than that of ne  k@xmath0 , there are essentially no high quality solar spectra that reach beyond 23   , including the most extensive sets of soft x - ray spectra obtained for the sun by the satellite - borne solar maximum mission soft x - ray polychromator @xcite and solex instruments @xcite that had coverage up to 22.43 and 23.0   , respectively .",
    "existing analyses of higher quality spectra whose ranges encompassed the o  k@xmath0 line obtained with rocket - borne instruments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) make no mention of a feature at the expected wavelength of 23.37   .",
    "the weakest intensity reported from the spectrum of a flare in the 10 - 100    range obtained by @xcite was 10  ph  arcsec@xmath47 , which can be compared with the measured o  vii resonance line intensity of 508  ph  arcsec@xmath47 . at a typical solar coronal temperature of @xmath48 ,",
    "the flux of the o  vii @xmath49 line is a factor @xmath50 stronger than our prediction for the o  k@xmath0 line and the non - detection of the o  k@xmath0 line is not a surprise . while the intensity ratio drops with increasing _",
    "isothermal _ temperature to a factor of 10 at @xmath51 , where the o  vii ion fraction is comparatively small , it would take the presence of relatively little cooler material within the instrument field of view to strengthen the observed o  vii @xmath52 line significantly .",
    "accurate measurement of the o  k@xmath0 line requires greater sensitivity than afforded by existing solar spectra .    as shown in  [ s : mcresults ] , the o  k@xmath0 line remains essentially blend - free and isolated for plasma temperatures encountered in the non - flaring solar corona .",
    "the line ew peaks at coronal temperatures of @xmath53conditions typical of those found in the coolest active regions and in the quiet sun . in the case of ne",
    "k@xmath0 , we found fluorescent line fluxes for quiet sun conditions of @xmath54  ph  s@xmath3  arcmin@xmath4 .",
    "the o  k@xmath0 line is expected to be an order of magnitude stronger than this . moreover , since the fe  xxiii and ca  xv blends remain at levels significantly below 10%  of o  k@xmath0 for temperatures up to @xmath55 , the line is also expected to be accessible in much brighter active regions where fluxes are higher .    as in the case of ne  k@xmath0 , the large intensity contrast between o  k@xmath0 and neighbouring strong lines  in this case",
    "the o  vii he - like complex in the range 21.6 - 22.1   , and the n  vii @xmath56 resonance line  imposes tight instrumental profile requirements in order to avoid contamination of the o  k@xmath0 region from surrounding line wings . in the absence of suitable simultaneous spectroscopic observations of the solar regions",
    "being studied for fluorescence , such an instrument would also require fairly broad wavelength coverage so as to measure accurately the fluorescing x - ray spectrum from the o  k threshold down to wavelengths at which the contribution to o  k ionisation is no longer significant .",
    "the short wavelength cut - off requirement will depend on the coronal temperatures being studied .",
    "we emphasise that in a practical application of the fluorescence technique for determining photospheric abundances , knowledge of the actual coronal composition is not required since the observed ew is compared to a measured coronal spectrum that itself must be used in model predictions .",
    "we have investigated the observability of the o  k@xmath0 line formed in the solar upper photosphere / lower chromosphere by fluorescence from overlying coronal x - radiation .",
    "while quite faint compared to the prominent lines of abundant coronal ions , o  k@xmath0 should be essentially unblended at plasma temperatures up to @xmath57 .",
    "the line ew peaks at temperatures @xmath53 with a value of @xmath58   , and we estimate an o  k@xmath0 flux of @xmath7  ph  s@xmath3  arcmin@xmath4 for the quiet sun at heliocentric angles close to @xmath59an order of magnitude larger than predicted in paper  ii for ne  k@xmath0 fluorescence",
    ". both lines should be quite observable with instruments adequately tailored toward high resolution @xmath60 and sufficiently well - behaved instrumental profile wings .",
    "the o  k@xmath0 line provides a potentially accurate absolute o abundance diagnostic , provided abundances of other prominent light elements are also constrained .",
    "it should also be possible to distinguish between the currently competing photospheric compositions of gs and @xcite , provided line ews can be determined to an accuracy significantly better than 20% .",
