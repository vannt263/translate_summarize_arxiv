    "churchwell & walmsley ( 1975 ) pioneered hii  region radio recombination line ( rrl ) studies of the relationship between nebular electron temperatures , @xmath2 , and galactocentric distance , @xmath3 , ( churchwell et al . 1978 ; wink et al .",
    "1983 ; shaver et al . 1983 ; and others ) . because rrls are not obscured by interstellar dust , relatively faint hii  regions at extremely large distances from the sun could be detected .",
    "they found that there was a galactic temperature gradient wherein @xmath2  is low in the galactic center and increases with @xmath3 .",
    "such a gradient was first observed in other nearby spiral galaxies by searle ( 1971 ) , rubin et al .",
    "( 1972 ) and smith ( 1975 ) .",
    "this milky way electron temperature gradient was confirmed by radio continuum emission ( omar et al .",
    "2002 ) and by [ oiii ]  forbidden line optical observations ( peimbert et al . 1978 ; deharveng et al .",
    "because heavy elements cool photoionized gas , hii  region electron temperatures are directly related to the heavy element abundance : low @xmath2  corresponds to higher heavy element abundances because of the greater cooling rate and vice versa .",
    "consequently , @xmath2  gradients should be inversely related to metal abundance gradients ( but see  6 ) . because there has been more stellar processing in the inner galaxy one expects that on average the metallicity decreases as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of a galactic gradient in hii  region electron temperature is now firmly established . nevertheless , there are still uncertainties in the magnitude of the gradient and the possible existence of real variations , both in @xmath3  and galactic azimuth , of nebular @xmath2 .",
    "extant rrl studies yield @xmath2  gradients that , roughly , vary from 250440 @xmath1 .",
    "discrepancies in the results obtained from different studies may be attributed to several factors , including the source sample , the @xmath2  derivation , etc .",
    "since the exact value of the @xmath2  gradient provides an important constraint on models for galactic chemical evolution , it must be determined as accurately as possible .",
    "here we derive hii  region electron temperatures based on radio recombination line and continuum data for a large sample of nebulae widely distributed across the galactic disk .",
    "the rrl data are of unprecedented sensitivity compared with previous studies .",
    "we examine anew the galactic temperature gradient and assess the magnitude and origin of the @xmath2  dispersion at a given @xmath3 . in  [ sec : obs ] we describe our hii  region sample . in  [ sec : te ] we derive the nebular electron temperatures and discuss non - lte effects .",
    "nebular galactocentric distances , @xmath3 , and heliocentric distances , @xmath4 , are derived in  [ sec : dist ] . in ",
    "[ sec : tegrad ] our new determination of the electron temperature gradient in the galactic disk is made .",
    "here we also investigate a possible spatial variation of this gradient .",
    "we discuss the astrophysical implications of our efforts in  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "our hii  region sample data are described by quireza et al .",
    "( 2006a ) and references therein .",
    "the radio recombination line and continuum data result from two different experiments .",
    "neither was targeted to investigate radial gradients in the galactic disk .",
    "the first one ( hereafter @xmath5he survey ) is a study of the abundance of @xmath5he in the milky way interstellar medium ( rood et al . 1984 ; bania et al .",
    "1987 , 1997 ; balser et al .",
    "1994 ) using the hyperfine transition of @xmath5he@xmath6 at 8.665 ghz .",
    "the observing techniques required that a number of radio recombination lines be measured simultaneously with the @xmath5he@xmath6 transition .",
    "these rrls were used both to monitor the system performance and also to measure the spectral baseline frequency structure . as a consequence of the large integration times ( over 100 hours in many cases ) accumulated during this experiment",
    ", we obtained extremely high sensitivity measurements of the he91@xmath7 and h91@xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) rrl transitons for a significant number of galactic hii  regions . the second experiment ( hereafter cii  survey )",
    "is a study of cii  recombination lines in photo - dissociation ( pdr ) regions surrounding the hii  regions . for this survey we simultaneously observed the h , he , and c 91@xmath7 and 92@xmath7 rrl transitions . since recombination lines of the same order with similar principal quantum numbers , such as h91@xmath7 and h92@xmath7 or he91@xmath7 and he92@xmath7 , should have the same intensity , we averaged the 91@xmath7 and 92@xmath7 spectra to attain higher sensitivity ( see quireza et al .",
    "2006a for details ) .",
    "all observations were made near 8.6 ghz ( 3.5 cm ) with the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) 140 foot ( 43 m ) telescope in green bank , wv , which has a half power beam width ( hpbw ) of @xmath9 at this frequency .",
    "our sample has 106 sources : 47 nebulae from the @xmath5he survey and 66 from the cii  survey .",
    "( there are 7 objects in common . )    the quantities needed to derive nebular electron temperatures are the h91@xmath7 line peak intensities , @xmath10 , the line full width at half - maximum , @xmath11 , and the continuum intensity , @xmath12 . these parameters and their errors",
    "may be found in quireza et al .",
    "( 2006a ) .",
    "there we also assess the quality of our data : we have defined quality factors , qfs , for both spectral line and continuum data . because we can not quantify the systematic errors , these qfs provide a qualitative measure of them . by choosing subsets of data with different qf s we can assess the importance of systematic errors on our conclusions reported here .",
    "quality factor _ a _ sources refer to our best data : the spectra are almost noiseless and systematic errors appear to be neglibible .",
    "the qf decreases from _ a _ to _",
    "e_. we judge qfs _ d _ and _ e _ to be of too low confidence to be included in our analysis here .",
    "the electron temperature of each nebula is derived from the observed radio recombination line - to - continuum ratio , @xmath13 .",
    "we model our sources as homogeneous , isothermal spheres .",
    "this approximation allows us to calculate the electron temperature without having to know the distance to the source .",
    "if the distance is known many other nebular physical properties , such as electron density and emission measure , can be derived .",
    "most of the emission observed from hii  regions is continuum radiation produced by free - free thermal bremsstrahlung in the plasma . at high frequencies the nebular gas is optically thin and the ratio between the brightness temperature of a recombination line and that of the free - free emission continuum depends of the radio frequency and the gas temperature , but is independent of the electron density , @xmath14 .",
    "thus the observed @xmath13 may be used to estimate the electron temperature of the hii  region ( goldberg 1968 ; rohlfs & wilson 2000 ) . assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and negligible pressure broadening of the lines by electron impacts , the electron temperature is given by : @xmath15^{0.87}\\ ] ] where we distinguish the lte temperature , @xmath16 , from the electron temperature corrected for non - lte and high - density effects , @xmath17 .",
    "the line frequency , @xmath18 ghz , corresponds to the rest frequency of the h91@xmath7 recombination line . here",
    "@xmath12(k ) is the continuum antenna temperature ; @xmath10(k ) and @xmath11(@xmath19 ) are the h91@xmath7 recombination line antenna temperature and fwhm linewidth .",
    "the @xmath20 ionic abundance ratio was calculated using the areas of gaussian fits to the h and he recombination lines ( peimbert et al .",
    "1992 ) : @xmath21 for a small number of objects we do not have good measurements of the @xmath22  transition . in these cases",
    "we used a constant value of @xmath23 for the @xmath24 abundance ratio .",
    "this ratio is the average of our 80 best qf ( _ a _ , _ b _ , and _",
    "c _ ) sources and is typical for hiiregions ( churchwell et al .",
    "1974 ; shaver et al .",
    "1983 ) .",
    "the nebular lte electron temperatures and their errors , @xmath25 , together with the galactocentric distances , @xmath3 , heliocentric distances , @xmath4 , and the @xmath20 ionic abundance ratios , are listed in table  [ tab : physparam ] . also given",
    "are the name of the source and some of its physical properties including the spherical angular size , @xmath26 , linear diameter , @xmath27 , flux density , @xmath28 , continuum brightness temperature , @xmath29 , and electron density , @xmath30 , ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "each nebula s survey membership ( either @xmath5he or cii ) is indicated .",
    "the electron temperature errors were derived by propagating the gaussian fitting errors for the line and continuum measurements .",
    "these @xmath25 errors vary from 0.317.8% ( 2.2% on average ) . for our best qf data ,",
    "@xmath25 errors vary from 0.411.0% ( 1.3% on average ) .",
    "these are lower limits to the temperature errors . due to",
    "baseline problems and complex nebular structures , uncertainties in continuum measurements are certainly larger than the one we estimate , reaching 10% or even 20% in the worst cases .",
    "since we have no way to quantify systematic uncertainties , we use the quality factors to estimate the effect of the systematic errors on the electron temperatures .",
    "the qfs for continuum and spectral line parameters are listed , in this order , in table  [ tab : physparam ] .",
    "the continuum observing mode can also affect the uncertainty in the measurements .",
    "we made continuum measurements using both the switched power ( sp ) and total power ( tp ) techniques ( see quireza et al .",
    "there we point out that as a source was tracked across the sky we interleaved the recombination line and sp continuum measurements such that both the continuum and line data span the same hour angle ranges and experience the same weather conditions .",
    "thus the line and continuum data would need identical corrections for telescope gain and atmospheric opacity . when calculating source properties that depend on the line - to - continuum ratio , such as the electron temperature , quireza et al .",
    "suggest using sp continuum measurements .",
    "we therefore normally use sp continuum observations to calculate @xmath31  because many telescope effects are canceled in the line - to - continuum ratio .",
    "we did not have sp continuum measurements for a small number of our sources and had to use tp continuum data to calculate @xmath31 .",
    "we estimate that the use of tp continuum data should give at most a @xmath3220% uncertainty in @xmath31 .",
    "the observing mode used is listed in table  [ tab : physparam ] for each nebula .",
    "accurate calculations of @xmath33 should incorporate non - lte effects including departures from lte , stimulated emission , and pressure broadening from electron impacts .",
    "these corrections for non - lte effects are sensitive to the local density and thus the hiiregion geometry .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown that under many conditions lte is a good approximation and the lte electron temperature @xmath34 is close to @xmath33 .    for conditions close to lte and where pressure broadening is not significant , the @xmath35 rrl intensity ratio should be about 0.28 , and the @xmath35 rrl line width ratio should be close to 1 ( shaver & wilson 1979 ) .",
    "we determined these ratios for the @xmath5he survey where the h114@xmath36 line has been observed . for our best qf data ( 28 objects ) ,",
    "the average intensity ratio is @xmath37 and the average line width ratio is @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , shaver ( 1980 ) defined a rrl observing frequency , @xmath39 , such that @xmath31=@xmath2 .",
    "this optimal radio recombination line frequency is a function of emission measure : @xmath40 .",
    "it is essentially independent of density , temperature , or structure within the nebula . using our best qf data ( 88 objects )",
    "we obtain an average frequency @xmath41@xmath42 .",
    "this is close to our observing frequency of 8.584@xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , detailed density structure models for a subset of our @xmath5he survey nebulae were made using high resolution vla radio continuum images and high - order rrls that were sensitive to local electron densities ( balser et al .",
    "the non - lte electron temperatures calculated for these models are very close to the lte electron temperature determined using the h91@xmath7 lines .",
    "we therefore conclude that our lte electron temperature must be very close to the real average nebular electron temperature .",
    "we derived the hii  region angular sizes by assuming homogeneous , spherical nebulae .",
    "each nebula has an observed full width at half - maximum size of @xmath43}^{1/2}$ ] ( geometric mean , see quireza et al .",
    "assuming that the source has a gaussian brightness distribution and that the telescope beam has a gaussian pattern with half power beam width , hpbw , then @xmath44 is : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the nebular gaussian angular size ( mezger & henderson 1967 ) .",
    "we use the technique developed by panagia & walmsley ( 1978 ) to derive @xmath26 , the angular size of a homogeneous , spherical nebula from @xmath46 .",
    "we use tp continuum measurements if at all possible .",
    "the nebular @xmath26 so derived is listed in table  [ tab : physparam ] together with the linear diameter , @xmath27 .",
    "objects whose angular sizes are close to the telescope hpbw are not well resolved and consequently have less precise estimates for their sizes",
    ". this will give a larger error for any physical property whose derivation depends on the angular size .",
    "one important property which requires precise angular size measurements is the electron density .",
    "if a homogeneous , spherical nebula is also optically thin , then the electron density can be calculated from the peak continuum brightness temperature of the source , @xmath29 ( balser 1995 ) :    @xmath47^{1/2}\\ , , \\ ] ]    where @xmath48 is the frequency ( 8.66565 ghz ) , @xmath31  is the electron temperature , @xmath49 , @xmath26 is the spherical size , and @xmath4  is the source s distance from the sun ( see  6 ) .",
    "here we assume no doubly ionized helium gas within the hii  region .",
    "the flux density , @xmath28 , is : @xmath50 where temperatures are in k , angular sizes are in arcmin , and the wavelength is in cm .",
    "the beam efficiency of the 140 foot telescope is @xmath51 .",
    "the nebular flux and electron densities calculated in this way are listed in table  [ tab : physparam ] . because @xmath52 measures the continuum radiation produced by free - free thermal bremsstralung in the plasma its value depends on the integral of @xmath53 along the line of sight .",
    "thus the electron densities derived here are the root mean square ( rms ) density of the entire hii  region . if the nebula is homogeneous , then the rms electron density equals the local density .",
    "detailed analysis , however , shows that this is not generally true for galactic hii  regions ( osterbrock & flather 1959 ) .",
    "the rms densities are probably somewhat lower than the true densities of the emitting regions , since the gas is not evenly distributed throughout the hii  region ( fich & silkey 1991 ) .      here",
    "we compare our electron temperatures with results from the literature for nebulae in our sample .",
    "the majority of these previous efforts were also studying the milky way @xmath2  gradient .",
    "most @xmath2estimates come from rrls , although measurements in other spectral regions are available for a limited number of objects .",
    "we summarize the @xmath2  differences in table  [ tab : tecomp2 ] which lists the number of sources in common , @xmath54 , the average percentage difference between our results and the reference , and the average percentage of the absolute value of difference between our results and the reference .",
    "the average difference will reveal any offset in @xmath2  scales ; the average absolute value difference measures the scatter between the studies .",
    "the table also lists the type of observation and the method used to calculate @xmath2  ( line - to - continuum ratio ; optical forbidden lines ; radio continuum emission ; etc ) .",
    "it is immediately apparent that our @xmath2 s are systematically high compared with previous studies .",
    "while one might expect systematic differences between @xmath2 s determined by different methods , the largest offsets are found between our values and those of wink et al .",
    "( 1983 ) ( wbw83 ) and shaver et al .",
    "( 1983 ) ( smndp83 ) which are both rrl studies similar to ours with many sources in common . in figure",
    "[ fig : comp2 ] we compare our lte electron temperatures with their @xmath2 s .",
    "our best qf data ( _ a _ , _ b _ , and _ c _ ) are plotted as filled symbols .",
    "our values are systematically 11% higher than wbw83 and 13% higher than smndp83 .",
    "we considered the origin of these differences in some detail .",
    "each and every term in eq .",
    "[ eq : lte ] may be the explanation .",
    "there may also be issues of calibration between line and continuum measurements and between telescopes .",
    "all the rrl studies were made at different frequencies using different telescopes with correspondingly different beam sizes .",
    "thus each survey probes different volumes of each nebula .",
    "certainly there is complex structure inside some hii  regions which includes large density and temperature fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath2  derived from disparate rrl transitions using different telescopes can well be different , especially under the assumption of lte .",
    "the beam size for the wbw83 sudy was substantially smaller than ours , so on the average they were observing higher density gas than we did .",
    "exactly how to interpret this is quite complex and would require detailed density and excitation modelling for each nebula .",
    "the continuum measurement technique is also important .",
    "these details can lead to @xmath55  measurements that are too low ( the continuum data do not extend beyond the hii  region ) or too high ( galactic non - thermal continuum is included in @xmath55 ) .    in balser et al .",
    "( 1999 ) our continuum observations from the 140 foot , mpifr 100 m , and the vla were carefully cross - calibrated , confirming the calibration techniques used for the 3  and cii  surveys .",
    "furthermore , our recombination line data are vastly superior to these previous studies due to a combination of improved technology ( system temperatures of @xmath5635k compared with @xmath56100k ) and longer integration times ( tens of hours compared with tens of minutes ) . in sum",
    ", we have yet to identify just why wbw83 and smndp83 have lower @xmath2  values .",
    "we have in fact reason to believe that our electron temperatures are the best values derived to date .",
    "we have substantially better recombination line data that have unsurpassed sensitivity due to a combination of modern receivers and our extremely long integration times .",
    "the modes of the distributions of source integration times for the carbon and 3  surveys are @xmath5615 hrs and @xmath5650 hrs , respectively .",
    "previous efforts have source integration times of @xmath5630 min or less .",
    "finally , these extremely high signal to noise spectra allow us to model the spectral baseline frequency structure with unprecidented accuracy which gives us great confidence in our determination of the recombination line parameters .",
    "we derived the galactocentric distance , @xmath3 , for each nebula using the observed recombination line lsr velocity and assuming a galactic rotation curve . for sources located inside the solar orbit we used the clemens ( 1985 ) rotation curve ; otherwise the brand & blitz ( 1993 ) rotation curve was used .",
    "both rotation curves assume purely circular rotation laws and they place the sun at a galactocentric distance of @xmath57 kpc orbiting the galactic center at an lsr circular velocity of @xmath58 km s@xmath59 .",
    "the nebular rrl velocities can be found in table  2 of quireza et al .",
    "( 2006a ) . here",
    "we have thus chosen to use only these kinematic determinations of the @xmath3   of our sources .",
    "many of the previous studies of the milky way @xmath2  gradient use a mix of techniques to establish the nebular @xmath3 .    the nebular heliocentric distance , @xmath4 , is also listed in table [ tab : physparam ] .",
    "these distances were also derived kinematically from the observed nebular lsr velocity . for sources located inside the solar orbit , each radial velocity value corresponds to two distances ( the `` near '' and `` far '' kinematic distances ) equally spaced on either side of the tangent point . in most cases",
    ", we were able to resolve the kinematic distance ambiguity by measuring the 21 cm hi  absorption spectrum toward the nebular continuum .",
    "discrimination between the near and far distance was done by comparing the maximum velocity of the hi  absorption with that of the hiiregion recombination line . for those objects for which we could not resolve the ambiguity via hi  absorption",
    ", we used distances available in the literature .",
    "our hi  survey , observational technique , method of analysis , and detailed description of our @xmath4  derivations are described by quireza et al .",
    "( 2006b ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : azm ] shows the distribution of our hii  region sample projected onto the galactic plane .",
    "only sources with known @xmath4  are plotted .",
    "the majority of our hii  regions are located in the first and fourth galactic quadrants and their @xmath3 s can reach @xmath6019 kpc .",
    "some sources are located beyond the galactic center with @xmath4@xmath5620 kpc .",
    "different symbols identify the @xmath5he ( triangles ) and cii  survey ( circles ) nebulae .",
    "the @xmath5he sources span a larger range of galactocentric radius and azimuth than do the cii  nebulae . filled symbols denote our highest qf sources ( qfs _ a _ , _ b _ , & _ c _ ) ; open symbols flag our poorer quality data .",
    "unfortunately , many of the low qf objects are astrophysically significant ; they are located in areas of the disk not well covered by nebulae with more accurate data .",
    "there is good reason for using only kinematic distances : homogeneity of approach .",
    "a detailed comparison between optical and kinematic distances is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "both approaches have their limitations and perhaps the resolution will be a direct trignometic measurement using vlbi techniques which is being pioneered by mark reid and his team ( xu et al . 2006 ; hachisuka et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "it is common to cite optical spectrophotometric distance uncertainties to be of order 15% .",
    "but as one delves into the literature in detail one finds a greater dispersion . for any given analysis",
    "the 15% holds , but slight differences in spectral classification , adopted luminosity scale which is model atmosphere dependent , and uncertainties in the extinction correction conspire to give a larger uncertainty when different research groups measure the distances to the same object .",
    "these systematic errors are the optical counterpart of the streaming motion uncertainty inherent in kinematic distances .",
    "so the consistency of optical distances may not be all that much better than the dispersion between optical and radio distances .",
    "most of our hii  regions at not optically visible .",
    "a quick web search for the 7 most distant ( in @xmath3 ) nebulae shows that the mean absolute value of the radio - optical discrepancy for these sources is 11% @xmath0 6% .",
    "non - circular streaming motions will certainly affect the kinematically derived distances . if we knew what the galactic scale streaming motions are we would certainly correct for them .",
    "the galactic bar , the spiral density wave , accretion events such as the sgr dwarf elliptical galaxy , and close encounters such as that which occured for the lmc will all generate large - scale , asymmetric streaming motions in the milky way disk . at present",
    "there is no way to calculate these effects accurately and thus generate the true velocity field of the galaxy .",
    "our hii  region sample contains some sources observed in both the @xmath5he and cii  surveys as well as nebulae that have rrl spectra taken toward multiple positions . for sources common to both surveys0.75 ( m16 ) , g23.421@xmath610.21 , g25.382@xmath610.17 ( 3c385 ) , g43.169@xmath620.0 ( w49 ) , g49.384@xmath610.29 , g49.486@xmath610.38 ( w51 ) and g79.293@xmath621.29 ] ,",

    "the exact fit to the 76 sample e nebulae in figure  [ fig : ohgrad ] is : @xmath118 with a correlation coefficient of @xmath119 .",
    "if our observed @xmath31dispersion of @xmath561,100 k is caused by real abundance fluctuations , then this would correspond to an [ o / h ] abundance dispersion of @xmath560.16 dex .",
    "we used extremely sensitive radio recombination line observations of a large sample of galactic hii  regions to study the nebular electron temperature gradient in the milky way disk .",
    "lte electron temperatures were derived from the observed h91@xmath7 rrl line - to - continuum intensity ratios .",
    "departures from lte were found to be small given the properties of our hii  regions and the fact that at 8.6 ghz the effect of pressure broadening is not large .",
    "our 109 source sample consists mostly of classical hii  regions of low density and with angular sizes larger than the @xmath9 telescope beam .",
    "our temperature gradient analysis has the following virtues : ( 1 ) we analyze a large sample of hii  regions spanning the entire galactic disk from @xmath3  = 017 kpc . ( 2 ) we use high sensitivity radio recombination line measurements obtained with very long integration times for our derivation of the electron temperature .",
    "( 3 ) all nebular galactocentric distances are calculated kinematically in a self - consistent way .",
    "( 4 ) all of the data were observed with the same telescope , the nrao 140  foot , identically calibrated , and analyzed in a uniform , self - consistent way .",
    "our best estimate of the electron temperature gradient is derived from a sample of 76 sources for which we have the highest quality data ( sample e of table  [ tab : tefit ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the present gradient in electron temperature in the galactic disk has a minimum at the galactic center and rises at a rate of 287 @xmath0 46 @xmath1 .",
    "this value is consistent with determinations in the optical by deharveng et al .",

    "our gradient is about a factor of two less steep than the gradient proposed by shaver et al .",
    "( 1983 ) .",
    "we find little if any variation of the electron temperature gradient with galactocentric distance .",
    "there is some variation of the temperature gradient calculated for different regions of galactocentric azimuth .",
    "unfortunately our nebular sample is not homogeneously distributed in the galactic plane which complicates this analysis so no firm conclusions can be drawn .",
    "the scatter we find in the hii  region electron temperatures at a given galactocentric radius is not due to observational error , but rather to intrinsic fluctuations in these temperatures that are almost certainly due to fluctuations in the nebular heavy element abundances .",
    "a comparison of the hii  region gradient with much steeper gradient found for planetary nebulae suggests that the electron temperature gradient evolves with time , becoming flatter as a consequence of the chemical evolution of the milky way s disk .",
