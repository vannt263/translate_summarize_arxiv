    "hard exclusive meson production in deep inelastic lepton scattering provides access to the unknown generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) of the nucleon  @xcite . for such reactions",
    ", it has been shown that for longitudinal virtual photons , the @xmath3 amplitude can be factorized into a hard lepton - scattering part and two soft parts which parameterize the structure of the nucleon by gpds and the structure of the produced meson by distribution amplitude  @xcite .",
    "gpds reflect the 3-dimensional structure of the nucleon and contain information about the total angular momentum carried by partons in the nucleon .",
    "hard exclusive production of @xmath0 mesons is sensitive to the gpds @xmath4 and @xmath5 which are the ones related to the total angular momenta @xmath6 and @xmath7 of quarks and gluons in the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the gpd @xmath4 is already somewhat constrained , while the gpd @xmath5 is still unknown . in the case of a transversely polarized target ,",
    "the interference between the gpds @xmath4 and @xmath5 was shown to lead to a transverse target - spin asymmetry ( ttsa )  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the cross section measurements , the ttsa depends linearly on the helicity - flip distribution @xmath5 with no kinematic suppression of its contribution with respect to the other gpds . therefore the ttsa of exclusive @xmath0 production can constrain the total angular momenta @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "for an unpolarized ( u ) beam and a transversely ( t ) polarized target the ttsa @xmath8 is defined as @xmath9 where the target polarization @xmath10 is defined w.r.t . the lepton beam direction and",
    "the angles @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the azimuthal angles of , respectively , the produced @xmath0 meson and the target spin vector around the virtual photon direction w.r.t . the lepton scattering plane ( see figure [ fig : angle ] )  @xcite .",
    "the cross section of exclusive @xmath0 production can be factorized in terms of angular dependent and angle - independent parts : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath15 is the squared virtual - photon four - momentum , @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is the squared four - momentum transfer to the target and @xmath18 represents the minimum value of @xmath17 .",
    "the complete expression for the cross section of @xmath0 production is given in  @xcite .",

    "r0.45        since the factorization theorem is proven for longitudinal photons only  @xcite , the asymmetry of @xmath0 mesons induced from longitudinal photons is of theoretical interest . under the assumption of @xmath2-channel helicity conservation ( schc ) , which implies that a longitudinal vector meson originates from a longitudinal photon ,",
    "the longitudinal component of the asymmetry is obtained experimentally through the decay angular distribution of @xmath0 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "each @xmath0 helicity state ( l , t ) results in a characteristic dependence of the @xmath28 cross - section on the @xmath29 polar angle of @xmath30 in the @xmath0 rest frame  @xcite .",
    "the interference terms between different helicities of the @xmath0 production are canceled if the cross section is integrated over the @xmath31 azimuthal decay angle of @xmath30 in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "the total angular distribution @xmath32 , including the dependence on the @xmath30 polar angle , can be written separately for longitudinal @xmath33 and transverse @xmath34 mesons : @xmath35 .",

    "the data were accumulated with the hermes forward spectrometer during the running period 2002 - 2005 . the @xmath1 gev positron ( electron ) beam was scattered off a transversely polarized hydrogen target with an average polarization of @xmath36",
    ". events with exactly one positron ( electron ) and two oppositely charged hadron tracks were selected .",
    "exclusive @xmath0 events were identified by requiring @xmath37 gev , where @xmath38 is the missing mass squared and @xmath39 is the proton mass . due to the experimental resolution and limited acceptance ,",
    "semi - inclusive pion production can contribute to the exclusive sample ; this is the primary background .",
    "it is well reproduced by the pythia simulation and is estimated to be of the order of @xmath40 .",
    "the ttsa asymmetry is extracted by using the unbinned maximum likelihood method where all the moments  @xcite of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath42 ( eqs .
