    "four - wave mixing ( fwm ) is a nonlinear optical process which has been largely investigated along the past several decades , both in homogeneously and inhomogeneously broadened atomic samples @xcite . since the very early studies of fwm , the possibility to enhance the efficiency of this nonlinear process through the use of resonant atomic or molecular media has led to the investigation of fwm processes using different atomic level configurations as , for instance , two - level @xcite , three - level @xmath0 @xcite , and four - level double-@xmath0 schemes @xcite .",
    "for instance , a highly efficient , low intensity , fwm signal has been first observed in a double-@xmath0 level configuration by hemmer et al .",
    "more recently this particular configuration has attracted much attention due to the generation of narrow - band photon pairs in atomic ensembles via spontaneous fwm @xcite , as well as the efficient generation of pairs of intense light beams showing a high degree of intensity squeezing @xcite . in those previous experiments",
    "usually two different laser frequencies are employed to explore the parametric resonance in the three- or four - level schemes .",
    "one common characteristic of the fwm process using @xmath0 or double-@xmath0 atomic levels schemes is the possibility of completely eliminating the resonant absorption by the medium due to the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit)@xcite , allowing also the control of the medium s refractive index @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the fwm process in a sample of thermal cesium atoms using a single laser frequency where different atomic level configurations ( @xmath0 and double-@xmath0 ) can be directly excited depending where the laser frequency is tuned inside the cesium doppler profile .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that a resonant fwm process in a double-@xmath0 level scheme can be observed via the usual crossover resonance .",
    "we also show that the fwm spectrum is strongly dependent on the intensity of the pump beams .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that the generated fwm beam can be correlated or anti - correlated to the incident probe beam depending mainly on which configuration of atomic levels is excited .",
    "it is worth mentioning that intensity correlation of two laser beams in a coherently prepared atomic medium , under eit condition , have been observed before @xcite .",
    "although these observed intensity correlations and anti - correlations are essentially classical in nature , they add new perspectives to the investigation of quantum correlated beams in such atomic system , owing to the previous observation of quantum correlated twin photon employing fwm in double-@xmath0 level schemes @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the experimental setup and the observed fwm spectra ; section iii is devoted to the development of a simple theoretical model based on the density matrix formalism to calculate the fwm spectra in different saturating regimes .",
    "we also present in this section a comparison between the calculated and measured fwm spectra . in section",
    "iv we present the experimental results for intensity correlations and anti - correlations observed for different laser frequencies , and present a qualitative discussion of the observed results .",

    "all three beams couple to both excited states .",

    "the main beam is sent through an acousto - optical modulator , with its non - deflected beam used as the f beam .",
    "the beam deflected in order 1 pass through another acousto - optical modulator ( with the same rf frequency as the first one ) and the new deflected beam in order -1 is used as beam p. such setup allows us to scan the frequency of p ( @xmath8 ) around the frequency of f ( @xmath9 ) . the polarization of f is rotated by @xmath10 before it is combined with p using a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "the combined beams pass through a @xmath11 plate producing the desired circular polarizations and are then sent into the cell .",
    "the beams diameter at the cell is around 3 mm .",
    "the transmitted beams are converted back to linear polarization by a second quarter wave plate and separated by another pbs .",
    "after the cube , f is retro - reflected to produce the beam b ( with @xmath12 ) .",

    "we envision such saturation coming in the following way . at low intensities ,",
    "the three observed peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : integrado ] comes from the matching of the two - photon resonance for the transitions induced by @xmath99 and @xmath100 with the individual , single - photon resonances of each exciting wave with different atomic levels . at high pump powers , however , the single - photon resonances at @xmath101 and @xmath102 are dislocated due to large stark shifts induced by the pump beams .",

    "the strongest signal at high pump powers end up occuring for nonresonant frequencies , for which the stark shifts are small and at least the two - photon resonance for @xmath99 and @xmath100 is still present .",
    "in order to have more insight about the physical mechanisms behind the experimental situation of the last section and to gain knowledge on the possibilities of manipulating the correlation properties of the fields , we have investigated the occurrence of classical intensity correlations between the probe and conjugated beams .",
    "we detected then , simultaneously , the transmitted probe intensity and the conjugated beam intensity with a pair of fast photodetectors connected to an also fast , 400 mhz , oscilloscope ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the beams had similar powers at the detectors , and both the optical paths and the electronic cables carrying the photocurrents were adjusted to have the same lengths .",

    "[ fig : correlacaot ] , which displays the signals observed on the oscilloscope as a function of time .        in order to characterize such correlations",

    "to acquire such information we have also calculated , thus , its corresponding fourier transform  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum2 ] we show how the crosscorrelation function spectrum is modified for different laser frequencies ( we keep @xmath106 ) .",

    "first we should note that the parametric fwm process leads always to intensity correlations in the fluctuation of the probe and conjugate beams since the photons in these modes are generated in pairs .",
    "this inherent intensity correlations should compete with the intensity correlation or anti - correlations induced by the differential absorption due to different atomic velocity groups . for the laser frequency at the @xmath107 transition ( @xmath22 ) the main contribution to the conjugated beam intensity comes from atoms with @xmath108 , thus all beams have the same frequency in the atomic frame and couple to the same transition .",
    "when the laser frequency fluctuates ( phase fluctuation ) , both beams p and c ( detected in our experiment ) simultaneously drive away or get closer to the atomic resonance ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : corrscheme](a ) ) . therefore both beams are equally absorbed by the atomic velocity group with @xmath108 which tends to increase their intensity correlation . now if we consider the absorption of these beams by the atomic velocity group @xmath109 , around @xmath108 , for instance , for the situation depicted in ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corrscheme](a ) ) , the conjugate beam will be closer to resonance than the probe beam and therefore will be more absorbed by this group of atoms , leading to an anti - correlation in the intensity of these beams .",
    "however , the absorption of these beams by the symmetric velocity group @xmath110 will induce an opposite intensity anti - correlation and , as the velocity distribution function is symmetric around @xmath108 , the two contribution will cancel each other .",
    "therefore , we conclude that for the laser frequency at the @xmath18 transition ( @xmath22 ) the intensity fluctuation on the transmission of the probe and conjugate beams should be always correlated due to atomic absorption .    on the other hand , for laser frequencies at the crossover resonance ( corresponding to the spectrum of fig .

    "fig : spectrum2](c ) ) , the main contribution to the conjugate intensity comes from atoms with @xmath111 .",
    "as before , when the laser frequency fluctuates , for instance , for the case depicted in [ fig : corrscheme](b ) the absorption of the conjugate and probe beams by this atomic velocity group will generate correlation between these two beams .",
    "however , differently from the previous case , the absorption of the probe and conjugate beams by the atomic velocity groups symmetrically placed around @xmath112 , which induces opposite intensity anti - correlations , will not cancel each other since the atomic velocity distribution around @xmath112 is not symmetric , specifically @xmath113 .",

    "such correlation measurements , thus , provide another evidence for the different velocity classes contributing to the signal at various conditions . in this way , it highlights once again the possibility of choosing from a three- or a four - level configuration for the generation of the dbfwm signal at a room temperature vapor .",
    "it also demonstrates the possibility of manipulating the correlation properties of the generated fields by choosing the position of the pump beams in the doppler profile .",
    "we have investigate the four - wave mixing process in a cesium thermal vapor and demonstrated that this simple doppler broadened system can provide different atomic level configurations for observing this nonlinear phenomenon .",
    "we also have developed a theoretical model that reproduces reasonably well the measured fwm spectra .",
    "in particular , the possibility of accessing a double -@xmath0 level scheme with just a single laser frequency can represent a considerable simplification for the production of quantum correlated photons , whose generation was already demonstrated in similar systems . towards this direction ,",
