    "the generalized kohn theorem @xcite ( gkth ) plays a crucial role in quantum dot physics with far reaching consequences .",
    "it considers interacting electron systems in a harmonic confinement and a constant magnetic field , and it states that excitations by long wavelength radiation are not effected by the electron electron ( e e ) interaction .",
    "this statement applies to arrays of _ identical _ harmonic dot confinements ( with e e interaction between the dots ) as well ( see appendix of ) .",
    "this does not mean that all excitations are independent of e e interaction , but only the optically active ones ( kohn modes ) , and it does not mean that e e interaction is not important for the other excitations . however , this fact prevents the e e interaction from beeing seen and investigated e.g. by far infrared ( fir ) spectroscopy .",
    "the fir absorption spectrum of the whole system agrees exactly with the spectrum of a single particle .",
    "the gkth does not hold for arrays of _ different _ dot confinements , e.g. periodic dot lattices with two different harmonic dot confinements per unit cell @xcite .",
    "then , all collective modes are excited by fir radiation and effected by e e interaction , or in other words , there is no kohn mode .",
    "the calculation and investigation of absorption frequencies and probabilities in the latter case is the subject of this work .",
    "+ in order to obtain a visual picture , let us first consider a classical model for the kohn mode for vanishing magnetic field .",
    "( this preliminary consideration will be replaced by a rigorous quantum mechanical treatment in the following . )",
    "classically , the charge distributions of all dots oscillate rigidly in phase with the bare confinement frequency , and the e e interaction contributes only a constant term to the total energy ( independent of elongation )",
    ". if we have more than one _ identical _ dots per unit cell , there are additional collective modes , in which the individual dots oscillate out of phase , and which are affected by dot interaction , but which are not optically active .",
    "consequently , the dot interaction is not observable with fir spectroscopy in arrangements of _ identical _ dots .",
    "one way to trick kohn s theorem is to include _ different _ dot species .",
    "then , there is no coherent oscillation mode for all dots , which does not change the e e interaction energy of the system in elongation , because there is no common bare confinement frequency . as a consequence , all collective modes ( two modes per dot in the unit cell )",
    "are effected by dot interaction and excited by fir radiation with a finite probability .",
    "in other words , the generalized kohn theorem for dot arrays is broken .",
    "+ other systems , where kohn s theorem does not hold , comprise : i ) anharmonic confinements @xcite ( circular dots with @xmath1 and higher order terms in the radial dependence or cubic dots with terms of type @xmath2 ) , ii ) hole dots with different effective masses @xcite .",
    "one point of this paper is that the gkth can be broken despite an exactly harmonic hamiltonian .",
    "a further possibility to observe the e e interaction in the excitations is to consider finite wave length @xcite .",

    "+ for two different _ circular dots _ with bare confinement frequencies @xmath112 and @xmath113 and @xmath114 , the absorption spectrum and the oscillator strength are shown in fig.2 .",
    "although _ all _ absorption lines are effected by the dot interaction ( represented by the interaction parameter @xmath105 ) , and _ all _ modes are optically active , there is no _ qualitative _ effect of interaction in the position of the absorption lines .",
    "the reason can be understood easily . in this particular case , the four eigenmodes can be calculated analytically providing @xmath115 where @xmath116 ^ 2   -(\\omega_1 ^ 2\\ ; p_2\\ ; d + \\omega_2 ^ 2\\ ; p_1\\ ; d + \\omega_1 ^ 2\\ ; \\omega_2 ^ 2 ) } \\label{eff}\\ ] ] ( the upper and lower sign belongs to @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively ) .",
    "consequently , if we had to interpret an experimental spectrum , we could do this using the formula ( [ nonint ] ) for non interacting dots , but with the effective ( i.e. interaction affected ) confinement parameters defined in ( [ eff ] ) .",
    "only if we take the intensities into account , we see some qualitative effect .",
    "whereas for non interacting dots ( with @xmath119 ) and for @xmath39 the oscillator strength of all modes agree ( for a single oscillator , @xmath101 is independent of the oscillator frequency ) , there is a large difference for interacting dots at @xmath120 .",
    "this large difference can be understood as follows . in the limit @xmath121 , the upper pair of modes develops into the spurious brillouin zone boundary mode , which has vanishing oscillator strength and the sum rule has to be fulfilled only by the lower pair",
    "( see also the discussion below ) .",
    "+ in fig.2 both dot species bare the same number of electrons .",
    "therefore , only one interaction parameter @xmath105 is involved .",
    "calculations with different @xmath122 ( and @xmath123 ) do not show any qualitative difference . in the limit of large @xmath105 ( and equal electron numbers ) we obtain from ( [ eff ] ) @xmath124 consequently , the square of the smaller effective confinement frequency ( which is the only one giving rise to modes with a finite oscillator strength for large @xmath105 ) approaches the mean value of both squared bare confinement frequencies , whereas the larger one grows continously for large @xmath105 .",
    "+ in fig.3 and 4b we show the results for two identical , but mutually rotated , _ elliptical dots_. without dot interaction ( @xmath119 ) , we have two doubly degenerate lines .",
    "with increasing interaction strength , we observe a splitting of degenerate modes and an anti - crossing behavior for finite @xmath125 . as in the case of circular dots ,",
    "the oscillator strength at @xmath39 for non interacting dots ( @xmath119 ) agree for all four modes .",
    "the dot interaction lifts this degeneracy .",
    "additionally , we observe at @xmath120 that the oscillator strength in the limits of small and large magnetic fields is considerable only for two of the modes , except in the gap region , where three modes contribute . by comparison of fig.s 3a and 4b",
    "we see that the magnetic field for minimum gap ( between the second and third mode ) increases with increasing @xmath105 , whereas the gap width decreases .",
    "consequently , the location and width of the gap provides information on the interaction strength .",
    "+ by comparison of fig.s 2 and 3 with fig.4 , and more clearly by consideration of formula ( [ large - p ] ) and fig.5 , it becomes clear that in either case the lower pair of degenerate modes at @xmath39 converges to a constant ( the mean square bare confinement frequency @xmath126 , which amounts to @xmath127 in our numerical example ) . even for finite @xmath125 , there are two branches , which converge to a finite ( @xmath125-dependent ) value for @xmath128 , or in other words , which become independent of @xmath105 in this limit . at first sight",
    "this looks surprising because the e e interaction does not show any saturation , if we increase the interaction parameter , but it continues to compress the dot state .",
    "however , there is a simple visual explanation for this feature : generally , the dot interaction adds an additional second order contribution to the confinement , which has the same symmetry as the lattice , i.e. it is circular for a cubic lattice . for large @xmath105",
    ", this additional term outweighs the bare confinement , and the effective confinement in both dots becomes isotropic and equal .",
    "thus , we approach the case of a lattice of identical dots , for which a pair of kohn modes exists . because these kohn modes do not exactly agree with the modes of noninteracting dots , we call them _ pseudo _ kohn modes . in a sense , the generalized kohn theorem reentries for dot lattices with strong interdot interaction",
    ". in other lattices with lower symmetry , the effective confinement in the strong interaction limit might be elliptical , leading pseudo kohn modes with a gap at @xmath39 .",
    "the other pair of modes ( which diverge for @xmath128 ) turns into the in - folded modes at the brillouin zone corner ( because the units cell halves if all dots become equivalent ) .",
    "these modes become spurious in the long wavelength and the large@xmath105 limit and the oscillator strength of them converge to zero .",
    "+ in fig.s 3a and 4b we observe an additional qualitative effect of dot interaction . for isolated elliptical dots",
    "we expect a gap between the two excitation branches at @xmath39 .",
    "however , for larger @xmath105 only the pseudo kohn mode might be observable , because the oscillator strength of the bz boundary mode decrease rapidly . on the other hand , the two lower modes for finite @xmath105 develope out of the degenerate lower mode for @xmath119 , whereby the degeneracy at @xmath39 survives .",
    "therefore , at @xmath39 it looks as if we had a circular dot .",
    "the closing of the gap between the two most intensive branches at @xmath39 is _ not _ a gradual effect proceeding with increasing @xmath105 , but initiated by symmetry .",
    "( for a deeper understanding see also the additional figures in ref . . )",
    "we have shown that breaking the gkth by constructing quantum dot lattices with at least two different dot confinements per unit cell has experimentally observable consequences . generally speaking , there are no kohn modes , i.e. interaction independent modes , anymore . in both of the considered cases ,",
    "the degeneracy in the fir _ intensities _ at @xmath39 between the upper and lower absorption lines is lifted due to dot interaction . for two",
    "mutually rotated elliptical dots ( per cell ) , we observe also a splitting of formerly degenerate absorption _ frequencies _ and the appearance of an anticrossing .",
    "for two different circular dots no qualitative effect of e e interaction in the absorption frequencies is observed .",
    "instead , the absorption spectrum can be mimiced by two noninteracting dots with modified ( effective ) confinements .",
    "we also pointed out that an extensively strong interaction destroys the effect of interaction by producing pseudo kohn modes .",
    "although this limit can not be reached experimentally , it might be important to take this tendency into consideration .",
    "+ only in the case of two circular dots there is a simple analytical closed form solution .",
    "however , with the formulae presented above , the absorption frequencies and oscillator strength for any cubic lattice with two harmonic dot species can be easily calculated .",
    "the only numerical task is to find the eigenvalues of an explicitly given non hermitian @xmath129 matrix and to perform a special sum over the eigenvector components .",
