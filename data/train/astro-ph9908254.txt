    "pulsars emit meter- to centimeter - wavelength radiation with brightness temperatures of @xmath8  k , greater than any other astrophysical sources .",
    "the ultimate energy source for pulsar emission is rotation of the neutron star .",
    "combined with this rotation , the neutron star s magnetic field generates forces sufficient to accelerate electrons from the stellar surface .",
    "these energetic electrons or the gamma - rays they emit can pair - produce after a few centimeters .",
    "the consequent cascade of electron - positron pairs permeates the magnetic field of the pulsar out to the light cylinder .",
    "the electrons and positrons follow the lines of the strong magnetic field closely .",
    "particles on the `` open '' field lines , which pass through the light cylinder , gradually carry away part or all of the rotational kinetic energy of the pulsar as an electron - positron wind , leading to the observed spindown of the pulsar .",
    "the `` polar cap '' is the region defined by the open field lines at the surface of the neutron star , from which the wind is drawn .",
    "this basic picture has long been understood ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . despite this understanding ,",
    "the physical mechanism for conversion of a small fraction of the spindown power to a beam of radio emission , which sweeps past the observer each rotation period to produce the observed pulses , remains uncertain .",
    "observational tests of models for pulsar emission are difficult because the emission is so compact .",
    "it can not be resolved with instruments of earthlike or smaller dimensions .",
    "melrose ( 1996 ) and asseo ( 1996 ) recently reviewed theories of pulsar emission . in all models , collective behavior of the electron - positron plasma results in coherent emission from groups of particles .",
    "melrose divides theories into 4 categories , according to location of the emission region : ( i ) at a pair - production front at the polar cap ; ( ii ) in the electron - positron wind on open field lines above the polar cap ; ( iii ) in the electron - positron wind far above the cap , near the light cylinder ; and ( iv ) at , or even outside , the light cylinder .",
    "theories from all 4 categories appear viable . indeed ,",
    "more than one emission mechanism may act , to produce the wide range of observed pulse morphologies ( @xcite ) .",
    "pulsars exhibit rich temporal structure , including complicated variations of structure of individual pulses about an average , and large pulse - to - pulse variations in flux density ; these offer clues to the emission process ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "because the fundamental modes of lower - frequency electromagnetic waves are linearly polarized , either across or along the pulsar s magnetic field ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the strong linear polarizations of pulsars yield the direction of the pulsar s magnetic field at the locus of emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "polarization observations usually suggest that emission arises near the magnetic pole of the neutron star , which is offset from the rotation pole .",
    "pulsars show stable , sometimes complicated long - term average profiles , but with large pulse - to - pulse variations .",
    "the most successful classification of these profiles is that of rankin ( @xcite , @xcite ) , who divides emission into `` core '' and `` cone '' components , corresponding respectively to elliptical pencil beams and hollow cones directed from above the magnetic pole of the neutron star . a host of associated pulse properties support this classification ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of these different components may indicate the presence of more than one emission process ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a few core emitters show interpulses , suggesting that their magnetic poles lie near the rotation equator .",
    "comparison of pulse width with period for these pulsars , and extension of this relation to all core emitters , closely tracks the relation expected if the size of the polar cap sets the angular width of the beam for core emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "rankin concludes that core emission arises very near the surface of the neutron star .",
    "interstellar scattering offers the possibility of measuring the sizes of pulsars and the structure of the emission region , and its changes over the pulse , using effective instruments of au dimensions ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper , we describe measurement of the size of the vela pulsar , from the distribution of flux density in interstellar scintillation , observed on a short interferometer baseline .      density fluctuations in the interstellar plasma scatter radio waves from astrophysical sources .",
    "these fluctuations act as a corrupt lens , with typical aperture of about 1  au .",
    "like such a lens , scattering forms a diffraction pattern in the plane of the observer .",
    "for a spatially - incoherent source , the intensity of the pattern is the convolution of the intensity of the pattern for a point source , with an image of the source ( goodman 1968 ) .",
    "the scattering system has resolution corresponding to the diffraction - limited resolution of the `` scattering disk '' , the region from which the observer receives radiation .",
    "the finite size of the scattering disk sets a minimum spatial scale for the diffraction pattern in the plane of the observer , at the diffraction limit .",
    "this scale is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the observing wavelength and @xmath11 is the angular standard deviation of the scattering disk , as seen by the observer . if the plasma fluctuations are assumed to remain `` frozen '' in the medium , while the motions of pulsar , observer , and medium carry the line of sight through it at speed @xmath12 , this spatial scale sets the timescale of scintillations , @xmath13 .",
    "differences in travel time from the different parts of the scattering disk set the minimum frequency scale of the pattern , at @xmath14^{-1}}$ ] , where @xmath15 is the characteristic distance from observer to scatterer , and @xmath16 is the characteristic distance from scatterer to source .",
    "observations with time resolution shorter than @xmath17 and with frequency resolution finer than @xmath18 are in the `` speckle limit '' of interstellar scattering .    for an extended , spatially - incoherent source , overlap of different parts of the image of the source in the observer plane , after the convolution , reduces the depth of modulation of scintillation : `` stars twinkle , planets do not . ''",
    "the relation of cohen et al .",
    "( 1967 ) and salpeter ( 1967 ) quantifies this fact as a relation between the size of the source and the depth of modulation of scintillations .",
    "the vela pulsar is particularly well - suited for studies of pulsar emission because it is strong , heavily scattered , and relatively nearby . in a typical `` scintle '' of observing time @xmath17 and bandwidth @xmath18",
    ", a typical terrestrial radiotelescope can attain a signal - to - noise ratio of a few , for observations of the vela pulsar at decimeter wavelengths .",
    "a short observation can thus sample many scintles .",
    "moreover , the scattering disk is large enough at these wavelengths that the scale of the diffraction pattern is on the order of the size of the earth , so that different radiotelescopes on earth can sample different scintles .",
    "the nominal linear resolution of the scattering disk , acting as a lens , is about 1000  km at the pulsar . for the vela pulsar",
    ", the diameter of the light cylinder is 8500  km . in contrast",
    ", the size of the polar cap is tens of meters , for a dipole magnetic field and a @xmath19  km radius for the neutron star .",
    "thus , observations of the scintillation pattern can distinguish among different theories of pulsar emission , as discussed in ",
    "[ psr_emission ] .    among the properties that place the vela pulsar s pulse into the core class are its single component , varying little in width with frequency ; its short period and rapid spindown rate ; its circular polarization ; and its weak , irregular pulse - to - pulse variations ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , vela also shows characteristics of cone emission , including strong , well - ordered linear polarization and a double profile in x- and gamma rays ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , radhakrishnan et al .",
    "( 1969 ) first observed in the vela pulsar the s - shaped variation of the direction of linear polarization characteristic of cone pulsars .",
    "manchester ( @xcite ) has proposed that vela s pulse ( and those of some other young pulsars ) could represent one side of broad cone , which would help to explain the apparent inconsistency .",
    "on the other hand , romani & yadigaroglu ( 1995 ) propose that the radio pulse is indeed core emission , perhaps from very close to the polar cap , and that the double - peaked x- and gamma - ray emission arises far out in the magnetosphere , near the light cylinder .",
    "krishnamohan & downes ( 1983 ) performed an extensive study of 87040 pulses from the vela pulsar , and found that the pulse shape varied with peak intensity .",
    "notably , strong pulses tend to arrive earlier .",
    "they also found that the rate of change of angle of linear polarization changes with pulse strength , and interpreted this as activity from emission regions at different altitudes and magnetic longitudes .",
    "they inferred variations in the location of the emission region by about 400  km in altitude , and by about about @xmath20 in longitude .",
    "emission earlier in the pulse was found to arise further from the star , and from a larger region .",
    "interferometers present several advantages over single antennas for observations of scintillating sources .",
    "because noise does not correlate between antennas , no baseline response need be subtracted from observations .",
    "moreover , interferometers are nearly immune to interference and emission from extended or unrelated nearby sources .",
    "the statistics of interferometer response to signals and noise is well studied ( see , for example , @xcite ) . for a short interferometer baseline ,",
    "interferometers measure the intensity of the source , commonly expressed as flux density .",
    "disadvantages of interferometers include the facts that they require coordinated observations at multiple antennas , and so often yield smaller effective apertures than the largest available single antenna ; and they often afford narrower bandwidths than some observing modes at single antennas .",
    "for the present work , careful treatment of statistics is essential and interferometers are preferred .",
    "we focus on observations of scintillating sources on short interferometric baselines in this paper .      for a point source in strong scintillation , sampled in the speckle limit",
    ", the distribution of flux density follows an exponential distribution ( @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath21 this equation holds if the source is small , compared with the resolution of the scattering disk treated as a lens , so that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the magnification of that lens , and @xmath24 where @xmath10 is the observing wavelength .",
    "the size of the source , parametrized as the standard deviation of a circular gaussian distribution of intensity , is @xmath25 . if @xmath26 is finite but small compared with 1 , then the distribution of flux density is the weighted sum of 3 exponentials ( @xcite ) . if , for example , the scattering disk is modeled as an elliptical gaussian , and the source is modeled as a circular gaussian , then the exponential scales are @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the angular standard deviations of the scattering disk along the major and minor axes , and @xmath30 sets the scale of flux density .",
    "we assume that @xmath31 ; this is equivalent to the assertion that the scattering disk , treated as a lens , does not resolve the source .",
    "the probability distribution for flux density is then : @xmath32 at large flux denisty , the first term dominates and the distribution remains exponential , but with different scale @xmath30 and normalization than for a point source . at small flux density , the probability density falls to zero at zero flux density , in a way that depends on source size @xmath25 . the larger the source , the more sharply the distribution of flux density is peaked near the average flux density .",
    "figure [ 3exp_fig ] shows sample distributions . in this paper , we use this expression , with modifications for the effects of noise , to find the size of the vela pulsar in 3 gates across the pulse .",
    "source size reduces the intensity variation due to scintillation .",
    "the cohen - salpeter relation formalizes this fact as a relation between angular size and modulation index , @xmath33 . here",
    "the angular brackets @xmath34 denote an ensemble average , approximated in practice by a time average . for a circular gaussian source viewed through a elliptical scattering disk , in strong scattering ( @xcite ) , @xmath35",
    "this expression is valid for arbitrarily large source size @xmath25 .",
    "the modulation index calculated from eq .",
    "[ psell ] is consistent with this expression in the limit @xmath36 .      because the scintillation pattern varies with time and frequency , integration over either reduces the depth of modulation and narrows the distribution of amplitude .",
    "it thus affects the distribution in a way similar to finite source size . averaging leaves the mean flux density @xmath37 unchanged , but reduces the mean square flux density @xmath38 , and so reduces the modulation index .",
    "we can calculate the effects of averaging on the modulation index , and liken them to the effects of source size , to assess effects of averaging on estimates of source size .    for a source with pointlike or gaussian intensity distribution , seen through a gaussian scattering disk ,",
    "the correlation flunction of flux density with frequency follows a lorentzian distribution ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the observing frequencies , and @xmath18 is the decorrelation bandwidth of the scintillations . for a small source with a gaussian distribution of intensity",
    ", the correlation function has the same form , with larger decorrelation bandwidth . for non - gaussian spectra of density fluctuations in the scattering material ,",
    "the correlation function shows the same behavior , with a different functional form ( @xcite ) . after averaging in frequency by convolving with a `` boxcar '' of bandwidth @xmath42",

    "this expression defines the convenient factor @xmath45 .",
    "a similar approach yields effects of averaging in time .",
    "the spatial scintillation pattern for a point source is the fourier transform of the screen phase ( @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "commonly , it is assumed that scintillation in time represents the motion of the scintillation pattern across the instrument , while the screen and pattern remain unchanged .",
    "for an extended source , the pattern is the convolution of the point - source response with an image of the source .",
    "if both source and scattering disk follow gaussian distributions of intensity , then the correlation function in time is gaussian : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the times of observation , and @xmath17 is the timescale of interstellar scintillation . if the observer averages over time interval @xmath49 , the mean square flux density after that averaging is @xmath50 \\equiv \\langle s^2\\rangle f_t   \\label{time_avg_s2}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 .",
    "the effects of averaging can be expressed as a reduction in modulation index or an increase in inferred source size . the post - averaging modulation index @xmath52 is related to the pre - averaging value by @xmath53 using eq .  [ modind_size ]",
    "we can infer a post - averaging size @xmath54 from @xmath52 , and so relate @xmath55 to the true size @xmath25 , using knowledge of the averaging bandwidth and time .",
    "this is the approach taken below .",
    "the effects of noise can be important for studies of scintillating pulsars because the scintles of lowest flux density are important in determining the size of the source .",
    "similarly , noise affects the distribution of intensity most strongly at the lowest intensities .",
    "thus , noise is important in determining source size .",
    "the interferometrist observes the signal from the source , along with noise , at 2 stations @xmath56 and @xmath57 and measures their correlation : @xmath58 .",
    "the correlation @xmath59 is often called the interferometric visibility , and is often expressed in units of flux density , using the measured or estimated gains of the antennas . for interferometric observations , @xmath59 is complex ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we use boldface characters to denote complex quantities . here",
    "@xmath60 are the electric fields in the observed polarization , at the two antennas ; and @xmath61 is the number of independent samples , the product of integration time and bandwidth .",
    "system noise may be in or out of phase with the signal , and so contributes to both real and imaginary components .",
    "signals from astrophysical sources are intrinsically noiselike , and their stochastic variations represent another source of noise , known as self - noise .",
    "self - noise contributes only in phase with the signal . without loss of generality ,",
    "we take the phase of the signal to define the real axis .",
    "self - noise then affects only the real component .    for a strongly - scintillating point source ,",
    "the measured correlation @xmath59 is drawn from the distribution : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the chi - square distribution with @xmath61 degrees of freedom ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "again , @xmath30 is the mean flux density of the source , averaged over many scintles .",
    "we measure the correlation in units of flux density , using the gains of the antennas @xmath64 .",
    "the system noise in units of flux density is @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the system temperatures at stations 1 and 2 , and @xmath64 are the gains at stations 1 and 2 .",
    "this equation assumes that the noise from the source has gaussian statistics . in practice the radiation from all known astrophysical sources",
    "does appear to have gaussian statistics .",
    "in particular , radiation from pulsars follows gaussian statistics closely , with time - varying amplitude ( @xcite ) . for some pulsars",
    ", the amplitude varies quite dramatically over short times within the pulse ( @xcite , @xcite ) , although the vela pulsar seems to be relatively stable in this respect .",
    "when the number of independent samples @xmath61 is large , the chi - squared distribution is well approximated by a gaussian , and the distribution takes the form : @xmath67 the variances of the real and imaginary parts of the correlation are @xmath68 and @xmath69 the flux density of the source , @xmath70 , appears in the denominator of the exponent in eq .",
    "[ general_cdist ] , through @xmath71 .",
    "this reflects self - noise .",
    "for 2 identical antennas , system temperature and gain are equal , so that @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and the correlation @xmath74 is drawn from the distribution : @xmath75 unfortunately , this integral is not easily simplified .",
    "figure  [ selfnoisedist_fig ] shows plots of the distribution of the amplitude of the correlation , @xmath76 , for a scintillating point source , for sample values of @xmath77 and @xmath61 . when @xmath61 is large , self - noise is negligible and the ratio @xmath78 is the average signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "when @xmath61 is small , self - noise becomes important .",
    "as the figure shows , self - noise increases the number of points at low amplitude , and flattens the distribution at high amplitude .",
    "if the number of independent samples @xmath61 is large , then self - noise can be ignored .",
    "the distribution of amplitude , @xmath79 , then takes the often - useful form : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the error function ( @xcite ) .",
    "the noise , in flux density units , is @xmath82 .",
    "we have adopted the scaled parameters @xmath83 if the antennas are not identical , the distribution has the same form in this limit , but the definitions of the scaled parameters are slightly different .",
    "because self - noise can often be ignored , as figure  [ selfnoisedist_fig ] suggests , this expression is often appropriate . for scintles much stronger than noise ( @xmath84 ) , and average flux density not much smaller than noise ( so that @xmath85 )",
    ", this distribution approaches the purely - exponential form @xmath86 the constant of the exponential is the same as that for a noise - free scintillating point source , but the normalization is different . in effect , noise shifts the distribution toward greater amplitude .",
    "when the source has small but finite size , and self - noise can be ignored , the distribution of @xmath87 takes the form suggested by the combination of eqs .",
    "[ psell ] and  [ erfc ] : @xmath88 here eq .  [ sscales_def ] defines @xmath30 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , and eq .",
    "[ erfc ] defines @xmath91 ) .",
    "this relatively simple relationship holds even though the effects of noise on the amplitude distribution can not be described as a convolution . for scintles with amplitude much larger than nosie , and average flux density not much less than noise , ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 , the limits of eq .  [ erfc_approx ] ) ,",
    "only the first of the 3 terms is important , and this distribution also approaches the purely - exponential form : @xmath92 in this expression , effects of source size appear only through the normalization .",
    "this fact demonstrates that source size affects the form of the distribution only at small amplitude .",
    "if the gain of the observer s instrument varies with frequency or time , then the distribution of observed flux density will be the superposition of several distributions of the form given by eq .",
    "[ psexpdist ] ( or eq . [ psell ] , if the source is extended ) .",
    "for example , consider a scintillating point source observed with a distribution of gains @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the gain .",
    "we take @xmath70 to be the true flux density of the source , and @xmath95 to be the antenna temperature , the observed quantity .",
    "the distribution of @xmath96 is then the convolution of the distribution of @xmath70 with that for @xmath97 : @xmath98 similarly , if the flux density of the source is not constant , then the distribution of measurements includes contributions from exponential distributions with different scales .",
    "the overall distribution of flux density will be the same ( eq .  [ superposed_dists ] ) , although the effective gain variations will be stochastic rather than deterministic . in either case , the distribution function will be concave upward on a semilog scale , because the distributions with highest average flux density fall off most slowly .",
    "figure  [ superposed_dist_fig ] shows examples , for flat distributions of gain about the mean .",
    "the effect is significant when the distribution gains includes very small or zero values .",
    "practical interferometers measure approximations to the visibility @xmath99 .",
    "in particular , interferometers almost always measure the normalized correlation ( @xcite , pp .",
    "214 , 248 ) : @xmath100 here @xmath101 is a correlator - dependent constant , and @xmath70 is the flux density of the source .",
    "note that the denominator in eq .",
    "[ rho_0_ta_ts ] does not include the number of samples @xmath61 .",
    "the denominator is simply a normalization factor ; it does not arise from , or characterize , the noise in the measurement .",
    "most signals are digitized before correlation . for 1-bit sampling , as for the haystack correlator used for the observations described here , the measured correlation coefficient @xmath102 is related to @xmath103 by the van vleck relation : @xmath104 often correlators tabulate the correlation coefficient scaled by the linearized van vleck correction @xmath105 . because normalization and digitization become nonlinear at large amplitude , and noise and source structure are important at small amplitude , their effects are relatively easily separable .    because normalization and digitization are important at large amplitude , where the distribution of amplitude is exponential even in the presence of source structure and noise , we investigate effects of normalization and digitization on such a distribution : @xmath106 .",
    "for 2 identical antennas observing an unresolved source , @xmath107 , and visbility is equal to the flux density , @xmath108 .",
    "then the distribution of @xmath103 will be @xmath109 note that the characteristic scale of the exponential is the signal - to - noise ratio in a single sample , @xmath77 .",
    "it is independent of integration bandwidth or time . at small @xmath103 , @xmath110",
    "can be approximated by an exponential distribution : @xmath111 the additive constant `` 2 '' in the exponential arises from the factor of @xmath112 before the exponential in eq .",
    "[ rhodist_eq ] .",
    "we can also include the effects of 1-bit sampling , by including the van vleck relation in calculating this distribution .",
    "for the scaled correlation coefficient , @xmath113 we show sample distributions of @xmath110 and @xmath114 in figure  [ rhodist_fig ] .",
    "as this figure demonstrates , the distribution of correlation departs from an exponential distribution at large amplitudes , when the signal - to - noise ratio is large in a single sample .      the modulation index , @xmath115 , parametrizes source size @xmath116 , as eq .",
    "[ modind_size ] shows .",
    "one can estimate the modulation index directly using this relation , by replacing the ensemble averages with finite averages over a set of observations .",
    "such a procedure replaces @xmath117 with @xmath118 , and @xmath119 with @xmath120 , and yields an estimate @xmath121 for the modulation index .",
    "unfortunately , these finite sums are weighted by flux density , so that they are most sensitive to the scintles with the greatest flux density . for a nearly exponential distribution of flux density , as expected for a small source in strong scattering , these strong scintillations are rare .",
    "therefore , the sums are slow to converge .",
    "the measurement is heavily subject to the shot noise of scintillation ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , source size affects the weakest parts of the distribution , to which these sums are least sensitive ; whereas most of the systematic effects discussed above are greatest for the strongest parts of the distribution .    to exclude the possibility that the estimate of size is biased by effects other than source structure , such as those discussed in   [ variations_gain_flux_sec ] through [ average_modind ] , a careful study of the full distribution is the most accurate approach .",
    "the modulation index expresses the distribution as a single value .",
    "weakest scintles are also the most common , so the important parts of the distribution can be measured with greater accuracy than can the modulation index . although the shot noise of individual scintles can limit the accuracy of a measurement based on a fit to the distribution , the accuracy is much better than provided by estimates of modulation index .",
    "a pointlike scintillating source produces an exponential distribution of flux density , so that one expects an exponential distribution of visibility amplitude for an interferometer , if the baseline is short compared to the spatial scale of the diffraction pattern .",
    "averaging in frequency or in time can reduce the modulation due to scintillation .",
    "we show that variations in system gain or intrinsic flux density of the source affect this distribution , particularly if the variations are of order 100% .",
    "system noise and self - noise also change the distribution .",
    "system noise affects the form of the distribution function at small amplitudes , and by a change in the normalization at large amplitudes .",
    "self - noise affects the distribution at all amplitudes when the number of samples @xmath61 is small .",
    "normalization of the correlation function , and 1-bit sampling , affect the correlation at large amplitudes , particularly when the source is strong relative to system noise .    for a source of small , but finite size ,",
    "the distribution of flux density is the weighted sum of 3 exponentials . by `` small '' we mean here that the source is small compared with the resolution of the scattering disk seen as a lens .",
    "scales of two of these exponentials depend on the size of the source , and are thus useful for size determination , the subject of this paper .",
    "these two exponentials affect the distribution at small flux density . because effects of system noise and source size are both important at small correlation amplitude , both effects must be included in data reduction .",
    "considerations of finite size , noise , self - noise , normalization , and quantization can be important for single - dish observations of scintillating pulsars as well .",
    "the effects of these factors depend on the details of the detection and sampling schemes used at the antenna .",
    "jenet & anderson ( 1998 ) describe some of the important effects , for digitization and autocorrelation .",
    "we observed the vela pulsar and comparison quasars on 1992 oct 31 to nov 1 using radiotelescopes at tidbinbilla ( 70 m diameter ) , parkes ( 64 m ) , and hobart ( 25 m ) in australia ; hartebeesthoek ( 25 m ) in south africa ; and the 7 antennas of the very long baseline array of the us national radio astronomy observatory that could usefully observe the vela pulsar .",

    "we correlated the data with the mark iiib correlator at haystack observatory , with time resolution of 5  s and with 160 time lags .",
    "fourier transform of the correlation functions to the frequency domain yields cross - power spectra with 80 channels , with frequency resolution of 25  khz .",
    "because of correlator limitations , we correlated only 6 of the 14 recorded bands for most scans .",

    "the 3 gates have average intensity ratios of about 0.7:1:0.5 , as discussed further in  [ obsintdist_sec ] below .",
    "the processor set the gates so that they were delayed according to the pulsar s measured dispersion ( @xcite , @xcite ) at the center frequency of each of the 14 bands .",

    "we detect no significant variation of gain with time .",
    "we measured the system noise from the distribution of amplitude for 0826@xmath126373 , and compared the result with other estimates . for a strong continuum source",

    "note that the uncertainty in the magnification factor @xmath157 dominates the quoted uncertainties of the size .",
    "the uncertainty in the magnification factor stems , in turn , primarily from uncertainty in the distance to the pulsar ,    the fitted size is in reasonable agreement with our earlier results for gate 1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the major differences in the analysis are the accounting for effects of averaging in time and frequency , for the effects of spectrally - varying signals on noise , and our use of the measured decorrelation bandwidth to determine the magnification factor , in this paper .      among the 4 classes of processes for pulsar emission discussed by melrose ( 1996 ) , the measured size of about 440  km rules out only models in which the observed emission comes from close to the polar cap .",
    "this region has a size of less than a km , much smaller than the observed size .",
    "if the emission originates at this location , but is transported to a larger region , such models are still viable .",
    "perhaps because pulsar radiation is collimated into a beam , many pictures of pulsar emission treat the radiation as emerging in only a single direction from each point of the emitting surface , perhaps along the local magnetic field .",
    "however , for the emission region to have the size we measure , the observer must receive radiation from points at the emission surface separated by @xmath164  km .",
    "the observer measures the separations between these points as the size of the emission region .",
    "figure  [ weather_retard_fig ] illustrates this fact . of course",
    ", different emitting regions could contribute at different times , so that the emitting region is a point at any instant , and the finite size is observed only by averaging over many points .",
    "our measured size is averaged over 10  s of observations , or 112 pulses , and over a range of pulse phase .",
    "aberration can significantly affect the observed size of the emission region . at a fraction of the radius of the light cylinder ,",
    "the pulsar s magnetosphere travels at a fraction of lightspeed .",
    "this can affect the interpretation of the measured size .",
    "in particular , the measured size can include the height of the emission region .",
    "figure  [ weather_retard_fig ] shows an example .",
    "aberration is particularly important in models where radiation is emitted at a range of heights .",
    "models for emission at a small fraction of the radius of the light cylinder , @xmath165  km , agree naturally with our observation . for a simple dipole field ,",
    "the open field lines have a cross - section of about 440  km at an altitude of about 450  km .",
    "however , sources that emit at a range of altitudes can have measured sizes that include effects of the spread in altitude , so that emission could arise at altitudes of 0 to 440  km , for example .",
    "models for emission from near or at the light cylinder could also produce the observed size , although in that case some physical process must limit the emission to a region less than 10% of the diameter of the light cylinder in size .",
    "the size , and its decrease across the pulse , are in approximate agreement with the results of krishnamohan & downs ( 1983 ) .",
    "they concluded that the emission early in the pulse arose from a larger region than that late in the pulse , and that the spread in altitude of emission was about 400  km .",
    "although their methodology was quite different , their picture of the emission region has remarkably similar dimensions .",
    "the measured size is large for `` core '' emission , which is believed to arise near the stellar surface ( @xcite ) , because it statistically reflects the opening angle of the dipole field lines at the polar cap .",
    "if vela s pulse does show core emission , as some suggest , this leads to an apparent paradox .",
    "the third gate , with size consistent with zero , might represent the core emission , with the leading edge of the pulse one side of a cone .",
    "studies of size of the emission region as a function of frequency , and imaging of the source , may resolve this question .",
    "measurements of size for other pulsars would also be extremely valuable .",
    "such observations are now in progress .",
    "arons & barnard ( 1986 ) pointed out that radiation traveling nearly along pulsars magnetic field lines , with polarization in the plane defined by the pulsar s magnetic field and the radiation s wavevector ( the `` o - mode '' ) , interacts with the outflowing electron - positron wind .",
    "this radiation can be `` ducted '' along field lines ( @xcite ) . in principle , such ducting can lead to a large apparent emission region even though the original source of radiation , perhaps near the pulsar s polar cap , is quite compact .",
    "lyutikov ( 1998b ) points out that microphysics can amplify , as well as refract , these waves .",
    "magnetospheric refraction takes place for only one polarization .",
    "the vela pulsar is heavily linearly polarized , so this picture and the size measurements suggests that the dominant polarization represents the o - mode . however , the less - dominant polarization mode is present , and should show zero size if magnetospheric refraction sets the size .",
    "thus , polarimetric size measurements suggest a simple test of whether magnetospheric refraction is responsible for the observed size .",
    "such measurements should be little more difficult than those described here , and are presently being pursued .",
    "we present measurements of the size of the radio emission region of the vela pulsar , from the observed distribution of correlation amplitude on a short interferometer baseline . in strong scintillation ,",
    "this distribution is exponential if the source is pointlike , and is the sum of 3 exponentials if the source is small but extended ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of finite size on this distribution are concentrated at small amplitudes .",
    "we find that averaging in frequency and time has effects similar to those of finite size .",
    "we calculate the distribution including effects of gaussian noise in the observing system , when an interferometer observes the source .",
    "this effect is likewise greatest at the lowest amplitudes , with a different functional form .",
    "we calculate the expected effects of variations in pulsar flux density and in instrumental gain : these effects tend to make the distribution more sharply peaked at zero amplitude and flatter at high amplitudes , and are small unless the variations in gain approach 100% .",
    "we calculate the effects of self - noise , which likewise make the distribution function higher at low amplitudes and flatter at high amplitudes , and are important when the number of independent samples , @xmath61 , is small .",
    "we finally consider the effect of normalization of the correlation function , and find that this makes the distribution function fall more rapidly than the exponential extrapolated from small amplitudes , when the correlation approaches 100% .",
    "we compare model distributions of amplitude with that observed for the vela pulsar on the parkes - tidbinbilla baseline at @xmath166  cm .",
    "we measure the noise level , and the variation in gain with frequency channel , from observations of a strong continuum source .",
    "models including a finite size for the pulsar in all 3 gates provide good fits .",
    "we correct the fitted sizes for the effects of averaging in frequency and time .",

    "table[table2_convfunc_fits_3best.out ] summarizes the results .",
    "the size decreases across the pulse .",
    "we find that effects of gain and pulsar flux - density variations , self - noise , the van vleck correction , and averaging in time and frequency are expected to be undetectably small for our observation .",
    "effects of normalization of the correlation function are detected , but do not significantly affect the size estimates .",
    "the linear size of the pulsar s emission region is about 440  km in the first gate , 340  km in the second , and less than 200  km in the third .",
    "we discuss size measurements for sources that , like pulsars , radiate into a collimated beam .",
    "the measured size is the size of the region on the source visible to the observer ; that size may not be identical from all lines of sight , so that the measured size may easily change as the source rotates , as we observe .",
    "aberration effects may also affect the measured size , so that the range in altitude of the emission region , as well as its width , may contribute to the size .",
    "our measured size is much larger than the sizes of postulated polar - cap emission regions , so that such models , without additional physics , are ruled out for this pulsar .",
    "however , magnetospheric refraction can duct radiation from a compact emission region to produce a much larger size ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed size is on the order of postulated emission regions in the lower open - field - line region , suggesting that this is a likely location for pulsar emission .",
    "it is much smaller than the outer open - field - line region or the light cylinder , but emission might arise in only parts of these regions , or might be beamed toward the observer from only certain parts",
