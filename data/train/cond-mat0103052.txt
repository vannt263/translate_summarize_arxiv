    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) has turned out to be very useful for studying the superfluid phases of liquid @xmath0he .",
    "the two superfluid phases a and b are distinguished in the nmr spectrum by different frequency shifts of the absorption peaks.@xcite in addition to these `` bulk '' peaks , one often observes additional `` satellite '' peaks .",
    "these are caused by topological objects and textures that appear in the superfluid order parameter . especially in superfluid @xmath0he - a ,",
    "several different objects have been identified based on the frequency shifts of the satellite peaks.@xcite the simplest of these are solitons .",

    "the satellite peaks in @xmath0he - a were first observed in measurements in the mid 1970s.@xcite soon after the theory of solitons in @xmath0he was developed by maki and kumar.@xcite their calculation gave a striking agreement with the measured frequency shifts of the satellite peaks at temperatures close to the superfluid transition temperature @xmath1 .",
    "this initial success had the consequence that further studies of solitons went to other directions@xcite and , unfortunately , no more precise calculations were done .",

    "( iii ) the effect of different parameter values was not studied .",
    "( iv ) the amplitudes and widths of the satellite peaks as well as peaks of higher order were not studied .",
    "( v ) dissipation was neglected .",
    "it is just these points that we address in this paper .",
    "an additional motivation is that the study of solitons opens the way to detailed understanding of more complicated topological objects such as vortices .",
    "we find that , using dissipationless theory , the agreement between the theoretical and experimental frequency shifts is generally very good .",
    "however , we find a puzzling disagreement in the transverse oscillation frequency of the splay soliton . this disagreement has remained unnoticed because no detailed comparison between theory and experiment has been published .",
    "further , we find that the theory is particularly inflexible to explain this discrepancy away . taking into account dissipation , in particular spin diffusion ,",
