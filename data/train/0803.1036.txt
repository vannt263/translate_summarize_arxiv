    "the existence of feeble magnetic fields of several microgauss in our galaxies @xcite , as well as of gigagauss in intense laser - plasma interaction experiments @xcite and of billions of gauss in compact astrophysical objects @xcite ( e.g. super dense white dwarfs , neutron stars / magnetars , degenerate stars , supernovae ) is well known .",
    "the generation mechanisms for seed magnetic fields in cosmic / astrophysical environments are still debated , while the spontaneous generation of magnetic fields in laser - produced plasmas is attributed to the biermann battery @xcite ( also referred to as the baroclinic vector containing non - parallel electron density and electron temperature gradients ) and to the return electron current from the solid target .",
    "computer simulations of laser - fusion plasmas have shown evidence of localized anisotropic electron heating by resonant absorption , which in turn can drive a weibel - like instability resulting in megagauss magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "there have also been observations of the weibel instability in high intensity laser - solid interaction experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a purely growing weibel instability @xcite , arising from the electron temperature anisotropy ( a bi - maxwellian electron distribution function ) is also capable of generating magnetic fields and associated shocks @xcite .",
    "however , plasmas in the next generation intense laser - solid density plasma experiments @xcite would be very dense . here",
    "the equilibrium electron distribution function may assume the form of a deformed fermi - dirac distribution due to the electron heating by intense laser beams .",
    "it then turn out that in such dense fermi plasmas , quantum mechanical effects ( e.g. the electron tunneling and wave - packet spreading ) would play a significant role @xcite .",
    "the importance of quantum mechanical effects at nanometer scales has been recognized in the context of quantum diodes @xcite and ultra - small semiconductor devices @xcite .",
    "also , recently there have been several developments on fermionic quantum plasmas , involving the addition of a dynamical spin force @xcite , turbulence or coherent structures in degenerate fermi systems @xcite , as well as the coupling between nonlinear langmuir waves and electron holes in quantum plasmas @xcite .",
    "the quantum weibel or filamentational instability for non - degenerate systems has been treated in @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we present an investigation of linear and nonlinear aspects of a novel instability that is driven by equilibrium fermi - dirac electron temperature anisotropic distribution function in a nonrelativistic dense fermi plasma .",
    "specifically , we show that the free energy stored in electron temperature anisotropy is coupled to purely growing electromagnetic modes .",
    "first , we take the wigner - maxwell system @xcite with an anisotropic fermi - dirac distribution for the analysis of the linearly growing electromagnetic perturbations as a function of the physical parameters .",
    "second , we use a fully kinetic simulation to assess the saturation level of the magnetic fields as a function of the growth rate .",
    "the treatment is restricted to transverse waves , since the latter are associated with the largest weibel instability growth rates .",
    "the nonlinear saturation of the weibel instability for classical , non - degenerate plasmas has been considered elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it is well known @xcite that a dense fermi plasma with isotropic equilibrium distributions does not admit any purely growing linear modes .",
    "this can be verified , for instance , from the expression for the imaginary part of the transverse dielectric function , as derived by lindhard @xcite , for a fully degenerate non - relativistic fermi plasma .",
    "it can be proven ( see eq .",

    "however , in this situation the wave would be super - luminal .",
    "on the other hand , in a classical vlasov - maxwell plasma containing anisotropic electron distribution function , we have a purely growing weibel instability @xcite , via which dc magnetic fields are created .",
    "the electron temperature anisotropy arises due to the heating of the plasma by laser beams @xcite , where there is a signature of the weibel instability as well . in the next generation",
    "intense laser - solid density plasma experiments , it is likely that the electrons would be degenerate and that electron temperature anisotropy may develop due to an anisotropic electron heating by intense laser beams via resonant absorption , similar to the classical laser plasma case @xcite .    in a dense laser created plasma , quantum effects must play an important role in the context of the weibel instability . in order to keep the closest analogy with the distribution function in phase space for the classical plasma , we shall use the wigner - maxwell formalism for a dense quantum plasma @xcite . here the distribution of the electrons is described by the wigner pseudo - distribution function @xcite , which is related to the fermi - dirac distribution widely used in the random phase approximation @xcite . proceeding with the time evolution equation for the wigner function ( or quantum vlasov equation @xcite )",
    ", we shall derive a modified dispersion relation accounting for a wave - particle duality and an anisotropic wigner distribution function that is appropriate for the fermi plasma .",
    "the results are consistent with those of the random phase approximation , in that they reproduce the well - known transverse density linear response function for a fully degenerate fermi plasma @xcite .",
    "consider linear transverse waves in a dense quantum plasma composed of the electrons and immobile ions , with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the wave vector and @xmath5 is the wave electric field .",
    "following the standard procedure , one then obtains the general dispersion relation @xcite for the transverse waves of the wigner - maxwell system @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the frequency , @xmath8 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath9 is the planck constant divided by @xmath10 , @xmath11 the rest electron mass , @xmath12 the unperturbed plasma number density , @xmath13 the electron plasma frequency , @xmath14 is the velocity vector , and @xmath15 is the equilibrium wigner function associated to fermi systems .    for spin @xmath16 particles ,",

    "the chemical potential is obtained by solving the normalization condition ( [ e3 ] ) , yielding , in particular , @xmath27 in the limit of zero temperature , where @xmath28 is the fermi energy .",

    ", it can be shown that @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the standard plasma dispersion function @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that either ( [ e1 ] ) or ( [ e4 ] ) reproduces the transverse dielectric function calculated from the random phase approximation for a fully degenerate quantum plasma @xcite , in the case of an isotropic system .",

    "this scaling law , where the growth rate depends on the fermi energy and the temperature anisotropy , should be compared to that of a classical plasma @xcite , where the growth rate depends on the thermal energy and the temperature anisotropy .    for a maxwellian plasma",

    ", we will thus have magnetic fields of the order @xmath90 ( one gigagauss ) .",
