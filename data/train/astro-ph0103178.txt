    "laboratory , astrophysical , and theoretical studies of fe  xvii are of considerable interest as it is a prime constituent in high temperature plasmas responsible for strong x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "a number of atomic processes need to be considered in detail , primarily : electron impact excitation , photoionization , recombination , and radiative transitions .",
    "large - scale atomic calculations are in progress for all of these processes in fe  xvii under the iron project and related works @xcite , in extended energy ranges suitable for practical applications . while electron impact excitation is an independent part of this effort , in this work we describe photoionization and recombination of fe  xvii .",
    "the coupled channel approximation including relativistic effects for many channel systems can be very involved owing to many infinite series of resonance structures converging on to the various excited levels of the core ion . whereas the relativistic and coupling effects have been studied previously ,",
    "all such theoretical and experimental studies of fe  xvii photoionization ( e.g. haque @xcite and mohan @xcite ) have been limited to the ground state and the relatively small energy range spanned by core excitations within the @xmath0 = 2 complex of the residual ion fe  xviii comprising of 3 fine structure levels up to about 132 ev , i.e.    h+ fe  xvii  ( 2s^22p^6  ^1s_0 ) e + fe  xviii  ( 2s^22p^5  ^2p^o_3/2,1/2 ) ,  2s2p^6  ( ^2s_1/2 ) .",
    "although the near - threshold behavior of photoionization and recombination cross sections ( pradhan @xcite ) is physically interesting , it is inadequate for practical applications that require the cross sections to be calculated up to high energies typical of the variety of conditions where l - shell ions are abundant .",
    "purely photoionized plasmas , such as in h  ii regions , planetary nebulae , novae etc . , are typically low temperature , but coronal plasmas cover a much wider range @xcite .",
    "for example , the temperature of maximum abundance of fe  xvii in the coronal ionization equilibrium is about 4 @xmath9 k @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in astrophysical objects such as the warm absorber ionized gas thought to surround the central black hole in active galactic nuclei , the plasma is most likely of a composite nature since most ionization states of several elements are observed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "high accuracy throughout the energy range of practical importance is therefore essential .    as the ( e  +  ion )",
    "recombination is unified in nature , it is theoretically desirable to consider the non - resonant and resonant processes ( rr and dr ) together .",
    "a unified theoretical formulation has been developed @xcite including relativistic fine structure @xcite , and used to compute cross sections and rates for many atomic systems , such as the k - shell systems c  iv ",
    "c  v and fe  xxiv  fe  xxv of interest in x - ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the unified results may be directly compared with experimental results , without the need to separate rr and dr . in this paper",
    "we present details of the low - energy results for fe  xvii and show that not only are the unified cross sections and rates in good agreement with experiment , but also illustrate how the unified calculations avoid the basic inconsistency and incompleteness of photoionization and recombination data for modeling of laboratory and astrophysical plasma sources .",
    "the present report describes in detail the 3-level and the 60-level close coupling calculations , with a discussion of the relativistic and coupling effects and comparison with earlier 3-level theoretical and experimental data for photoionization and recombination .",
    "while photoionization and recombination are usually considered separately , we exemplify and emphasize the underlying physical unity , via detailed balance , between the two processes as naturally treated in the close coupling method .",
    "photoionization and recombination may both be considered using _",
    "identical _ coupled channel wavefunction expansion ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 represents a ( @xmath12 + 1)-electron bound or continuum state depending on @xmath130 or @xmath140 , expressed in terms of the @xmath12-electron residual core ion eigenfunctions .",
    "the @xmath15 is the target wavefunction in a specific state @xmath16 or @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the wavefunction for the ( @xmath12 + 1)-th electron in a channel labeled as @xmath19 ; @xmath20 being its incident kinetic energy .",
    "@xmath21 s are the correlation functions of the ( @xmath12 + 1)-electron system that account for short range correlation and the orthogonality between the continuum and the bound orbitals .",
    "the r - matrix method @xcite , and its relativistic breit - pauli extension @xcite , enables a solution for the total @xmath11 , with a suitable expansion over the @xmath22 .",
    "the breit - pauli r - matrix ( bprm ) method has been extensively employed for electron impact excitation under the iron project @xcite .",
    "the extension of the bprm formulation to unified electronic recombination @xcite , and theoretically self - consistent calculations of photoionization and recombination is sketched below .",
    "recombination of an incoming electron to the target ion may occur through non - resonant , background continuum , usually referred to as radiative recombination ( rr ) ,    @xmath23    which is the inverse process of direct photoionization , or through the two - step recombination process via autoionizing resonances , i.e. dielectronic recombination ( dr ) :    @xmath24    where the incident electron is in a quasi - bound doubly - excited state which leads either to ( i ) autoionization , a radiation - less transition to a lower state of the ion and the free electron , or to ( ii ) radiative stabilization predominantly via decay of the ion core , usually to the ground state , and the bound electron .    in the unified treatment the photoionization cross sections , @xmath25 , of a large number of low-@xmath0 bound states  all possible states with @xmath26 ",
    "are obtained in the close coupling ( cc ) approximation as in the opacity project @xcite . coupled channel calculations for @xmath25 include both the background and the resonance structures ( due to the doubly excited autoionizing states ) in the cross sections .",
    "the recombination cross section , @xmath27 , is related to @xmath25 , through detailed balance ( milne relation ) as    @xmath28    in rydberg units ; @xmath29 is the fine structure constant , @xmath30 is the photoelectron energy , and @xmath31 is the ionization potential .",
    "resonant and non - resonant electronic recombination takes place into an infinite number of bound levels of the ( e  +  ion ) system .",
    "these are divided into two groups : ( a ) the low-@xmath0 ( @xmath32 10 ) levels , considered via detailed close coupling calculations for photorecombination , with highly resolved delineation of autoionizing resonances , and ( b ) the high-@xmath0 ( @xmath33 ) recombining levels via dr , neglecting the background . in previous works ( e.g. @xcite ) it has been shown that in the energy region corresponding to ( b ) , below threshold for dr , the non - resonant contribution is negligible .",
    "the dr cross sections converge on to the electron impact excitation cross section at threshold ( @xmath34 ) , as required by unitarity , i.e. conservation of photon and electron fluxes .",
    "this theoretical limit is an important check on the calculations , and enables a determination of field ionization of rydberg levels of resonances contributing to dr .",
    "the ab initio method outlined above is a theoretically and computationally unified treatment based on the close coupling approximation .",
    "recombination involves an infinite number of recombined bound states , and several infinite series of resonances . in principle",
    ", the unified method may be used for photoionization / photorecombination of arbitrarily high @xmath35 levels . however , in practice approximations may be made for sufficiently high quantum numbers .",
    "background recombination is negligible , and dr dominates , usually for @xmath36 10 .",
    "similarly , background ( non - resonant ) cross sections may be accurately obtained using hydrogenic approximation for @xmath37 levels with @xmath38 .",
    "but there is nothing particular about @xmath39 = 10 , and any larger or lower value may be used provided the approximations are verifiably valid , as has been shown in our previous works and is done in the present calculations .",
    "for example , @xmath0 = 18  22 + resonances in the present work are fully delineated using group ( a ) photorecombination calculations , and not dr .",
    "thus the use of these approximations does not result in any significant error , or loss of generality , and does not detract from the main part of the calculations that are a unified representation of the non - resonant and resonant recombination ( rr and dr ) , including any interference effects between the two .",
    "the present dr calculations use an extension of the precise theory by bell and seaton @xcite , based on multi - channel quantum defect theory , that is very accurate for high-@xmath0 ( correspondence between photorecombination and dr is established in our previous work @xcite ) .",
    "finally , all close coupling scattering and photoionization calculations employ a `` top - up '' procedure for high partial waves , and approximations for high-@xmath0 resonances below rydberg series limits as @xmath34 ( e.g. `` gailitis averaging '' ) .",
    "such procedures are routinely implemented in large - scale calculations in the opacity project ( @xcite and references therein ) and the iron project r - matrix calculations ( @xcite ) that the unified method for recombination is based upon .",
    "the complete wavefunction expansion entails the 60 fine structure levels of fe  xviii given in table 1 .",
    "these are obtained from an optimized configuration - interaction ( ci ) type calculation using the code superstructure @xcite .",
    "the configuration set is divided into the 5 _ spectroscopic _ configurations @xmath40 that dominate the 60 core level wavefunctions , and _ correlation _ configurations , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "calculated fe  xviii eigenenergies are compared with experimental data from the national institute for standards and technology ( nist ) .",
    "the accuracy of the eigenfunctions is also ascertained by comparing the fe  xviii oscillator strengths for dipole transitions with available data from nist in table 2 .",
    "photoionization and recombination calculations both employ the fe  xviii eigenfunctions with the same ci .",
    "we carry out two sets of calculations , ( i ) a 3-level calculations including only the @xmath0 = 2 levels , and ( ii ) the 60-level eigenfunction expansion including most of the @xmath0 = 3 complex .",
    "the inner @xmath43-shell excitations are not considered owing to computational constraints and possibly weaker couplings ( only the allowed @xmath44 core excitations are likely to be of importance , and not the @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) .    for the 3-level case ,",
    "since we calculate both photoionization and photo - recombination cross sections , we include many @xmath47 symmetries to obtain 15 total @xmath48 symmetries .",
    "specifically these are @xmath49 for the even parity and @xmath50 for the odd parity , and the @xmath47 symmetries used are @xmath51 for both singlets and triplets in both parities . for the 60-level case ,",
    "presently we only calculate photoionization cross section for the ground level and some selected excited levels .",
    "therefore , we only include @xmath52 for the even ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 for the odd parity ( @xmath55 ) at this moment .",
    "all the @xmath47 symmetries that contribute to these two @xmath47 s are included .",
    "of course , for obtaining photo - recombination cross sections we need to include an many @xmath48 symmetries as in the 3-level case .",
    "the following sections present a sample of the extensive results from the two sets of calculations for photoionization and recombination .",
    "the 3-level calculations are compared with earlier theoretical and experimental works .",
    "the present close coupling calculations for the 3-level and the 60-level cases are labeled 3cc and 60cc respectively .      fig .",
    "1a presents the bprm photoionization cross section for the ground level @xmath56 of fe  xvii from the 60cc calculation ( solid line ) , showing the series of resonances converging on to the @xmath0 = 2 thresholds @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and the @xmath0 = 3 thresholds . for comparison ,",
    "the non - resonant cross sections from a relativistic distorted wave ( rdw ) calculation ( e.g. @xcite ) are also shown ( dashed line ) . the resonance pattern , and the background cross sections , are essentially similar to the 3-level calculations in @xcite in the relativistic random phase approximation ( rrpa ) , with resonances included using multi - channel quantum defect theory ( mqdt ) , and the @xmath59 and breit - pauli @xmath60-coupled r - matrix calculations also reported by haque @xcite .",
    "while there are no significant differences in magnitude or detail with the earlier calculations , it might be noted that the near - threshold region spanning the 3 levels of the @xmath0 = 2 complex , is rather simple in terms of structure and coupling effects .",
    "1b shows an expanded view of this region with series of resonances @xmath61 and the stronger series , connected to the ground level via a dipole core transition , @xmath62 .",
    "2 shows a comparison between the 60cc and the 3cc calculations , with similar resolution , indicating that below the @xmath0 = 2 thresholds there is no significant difference between the two .",
    "the situation is considerably more complicated above the @xmath0 = 2 complex .",
    "although the ground level photoionization cross section of fe  xvii is not hugely affected by the @xmath0 = 3 complexes of resonances ( fig .",
    "1a ) , the excited level cross sections are , as seen in fig .",
    "3a , b , c .",
    "this is of considerable importance in recombination work where photorecombination to group ( a ) levels is considered explicitly .",
    "the dense and detailed resonance structures converging on to the 57 @xmath0 = 3 levels , and in between , would enhance the effective photoionization and recombination cross sections and rates far above the background .",
    "it might be noted that the resonances in cross sections below the @xmath0 = 2 , in the energy range covered by the 3-level calculations shown in figs .  1 and 2 , are much smaller than in the 60cc cross sections .",
    "this implies , in particular , that resonant recombination into the @xmath0 = 3 series of resonances converging on to a large number of excited states will be important for recombination , discussed in the next section .",
    "as the above results show , the 3-level calculations in the present and earlier works ( e.g. @xcite ) are inadequate for the entire energy range of interest in practical applications for photoionization and recombination . also , a 3-level calculation gives little indication of the complexity of the cross sections , particularly for the excited states , since it covers only @xmath6 core excitations and couplings that are responsible for resonances .",
    "the @xmath4 couplings can be much stronger and give rise to more extensive resonances as in fig .",
    "it is clear that although fe  xvii is a highly charged ion the electron correlation effects are not weak in excited state photoionization , or in the near - threshold region .",
    "finally , fe  xvii is a closed shell system where simpler approximations ( e.g. haque @xcite ) can be readily applied without explicit consideration of detailed multiplet and fine structure that is more involved in open - shell systems .",
    "thus photoionization of other highly charged ions may not be amenable to the approximations described in @xcite .",
    "in fact the atomic structure of open - shell fe ions isoelectronic with the third row of the periodic table present considerable difficulties owing to strong coupling effects among up to several hundred fine structure levels .",
    "such is the case in a number of scattering calculations carried out under the iron project for open - shell fe ions where extensive resonance structures manifest themselves @xcite .",
    "giant resonances manifest themselves at photon frequencies associated with strong dipole transitions in the core ion .",
    "these are a particularly important example of the coupling effects and are called the photoexcitation - of - core ( pec ) resonances ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the pec resonances have the following properties , : ( i ) they are at the photon frequency of the dipole transition in the core , ( ii ) they are present in photoionization cross sections of the entire rydberg series of bound levels of the system , ( iii ) their width and height are orders of magnitude larger than individual rybderg resonances , and ( iv ) they are related to the inverse resonant recombination process dr ( discussed in the next section ) . the pec features are most evident in photoionization cross sections , as a function of photon energy , of several members of a rydberg series of bound levels where , in analogy with the dr process , the outer electron is weakly bound and may be considered a ` spectator ' interacting but weakly with the core excitation(s ) .",
    "4 shows the large pec feature in the 60cc photoionization cross sections of the series @xmath63 levels of fe  xvii .",
    "the pec resonances in fig .",
    "4 are associated with not just one dipole transition , but several transitions belonging to the transition arrays @xmath64 at about 63 ry corresponding to all such levels included in the 60cc expansion of the core ion fe  xviii ( eq .  1.1 , table 1 ) .",
    "the pec resonances rise order of magnitude above the background , and are much wider than all other resonances .",
    "the different threshold ionization energies in fig .",
    "4 approach @xmath65 as @xmath0 increases .",
    "radiation damping of resonances has been addressed in many previous works .",
    "it was pointed out in ref . @xcite",
    "that it is likely to be of practical importance only for h - like and he - like core ions , when the core radiative transition rates are of the same order as the autoionization rates , typically @xmath66 , but not for other ionic systems .",
    "fe  xvii was explicitly mentioned in @xcite as the next possible candidate ( other than h - like and he - like ions ) for an investigation of the radiation damping effects _ in toto_. we discuss here the radiation damping involving the resonances associated with the @xmath67 levels in the context of low - energy recombination , and leave the discussion on the @xmath68 resonances in future when the much more extensive photo - recombination calculations with the 60cc target are presented .",
    "it might be noted however that although the radiative decay rates of the @xmath0 = 3 levels are higher , they also have additional autoionization modes of decay into excited @xmath0 = 2 levels .",
    "the associated core transition rates in fe  xviii for @xmath69 to @xmath70 and @xmath71 are @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively . fig .",
    "5 shows an enhanced view of the radiatively damped ( rd ) and undamped ( nrd ) resonances in photoionization of fe  xvii up to resonances complexes with @xmath0 = 16 .",
    "the pr calculations in the unified formulation generally employ cross sections up to @xmath0 = 10 only .",
    "no significant effect is discernible between fig .",
    "5a and 5b , and it is concluded that radiation damping of resonances in @xmath0-complexes up to @xmath0 = 10 ( e.g. group ( a ) ) is not likely to affect any practical applications of the computed photoionization and recombination cross sections . that is not to say that resonances with sufficiently high @xmath0 and @xmath74 will not be damped significantly ( or completely ) ; since the autoionization rates decrease as @xmath75 , they must",
    ". however , such resonances are extremely narrow ( not , for example , evident in fig .  5 ) , and do not affect effective photoionization or recombination cross sections .",
    "therefore it is unlikely that radiation damping of group ( a ) resonances ( an integral part of the unified calculations ) in any other ionic system up to the iron - peak elements will be important , since the dipole transition probabilities of resonance transitions in all ions up to fe ions are less than or equal to those in fe  xviii , of the order of 10@xmath76 sec@xmath77 , with the already noted exception of h - like and he - like ions @xcite .",
    "salient features of the 1817 recombination are described within the unified formulation , and with reference to experimental data from the ion storage ring at heidelberg , germany @xcite .",
    "both the unified cross sections and experimental measurements naturally measure the combined non - resonant and resonant ( rr and dr ) contributions to recombination and should in principle be compared directly .",
    "fig .  6 from ref .",
    "@xcite shows a comparison of the present unified cross sections as computed in detail , and averaged over a gaussian function for comparison with experiment , together with the experimental cross sections @xcite .",
    "the agreement is generally very good over the entire range , and in both the detail and the magnitude of resonances .",
    "this includes the dominant dr contribution below the @xmath78 threshold connected via a dipole transition ; in this range the background non - resonant contribution ( rr ) is small . on the other hand the weaker series of resonances , @xmath79 lie in the near - threshold region dominated by the non - resonant contribution that rises steeply as @xmath80 , and is therefore not a major contributor to recombination rate ( discussed below ) . thus the unified theoretical ( and experimental ) results shown in fig .",
    "6 display the three related , but discernible , types of contributions to total 1817 recombination cross section : the overlapping non - resonant ( rr ) contribution and the dr contribution from the @xmath81 series , and the mainly dr contribution from the @xmath82 series .      the experimental data in fig .",
    "6 do not precisely delineate or identify the resonances , and the background contribution ( rr - type ) is not ascertained from the measurements , possibly owing to contribution from charge transfer @xcite .",
    "the blended resonance features are fitted to a beam response function to eliminate the background , and their energies are determined approximately according to @xmath0 and @xmath74 , using non - relativistic @xmath74-dependent quantum defects in the rydberg formula .",
    "however , @xmath74 is not a good quantum number and the number of @xmath74-resonances within an @xmath0-complex is not exactly known .",
    "the theoretical resonances on the other hand are uniquely identified with the intermediate coupling spectroscopic designation @xmath83 .",
    "therefore a 11 correspondence between the experimental measurements and relativistic cross sections can not be established .",
    "further , since the background contribution , although dominant at low energies as @xmath84 ( fig .",
    "6 ) , is not considered , a direct comparison with the unified cross sections and the experimental data @xcite is not possible .    nonetheless , for @xmath0-complexes where the background contribution is small compared to the resonant part",
    ", we may compare the average ` resonance strengths ' @xcite , although these are not exactly defined ( see @xcite for a definition of the resonance oscillator strength in terms of the integrated @xmath85 , the differential oscillator strength per unit energy ) .",
    "7b , c , d show a detailed view at high resolution of the first three @xmath86 complexes , with @xmath0 = 6,7,8 . in order to ensure complete resolution of resonances an energy mesh of up to 10@xmath87 ev",
    "was used before numerical integration .",
    "the integrated , and summed , resonance strengths for the @xmath0 = 6,7,8 complexes are 1201.2 , 421.8 , and 221.1 @xmath88 ev , compared to experimental values of 1240.2 , 412.0 , and 253.9 @xcite . the present value for @xmath0 = 7 complex is higher than reported in ref . @xcite as it is recalculated with higher resolution .",
    "the value for the @xmath0 = 8 complex has been complemented by the contributions from @xmath89 7 symmetries , @xmath48 = 8@xmath90 and 9@xmath91 ; without which the value is 200.5 @xmath88 ev . although the theoretical resonance strengths were checked to have converged with respect to the energy mesh , they seem to be somewhat systematically lower than the reported experimental data ( the theoretical mcbp and the mcdf values in @xcite also showed the same trend ) .",
    "7a is rather different , in that it shows the much narrower @xmath92 resonances with high @xmath0 = 18  22 . while it is not apparent from the figure , nor from the experimental data in fig .",
    "6 ( bottom most panel ) , there are 2,985 resonances found in the small 0 - 5 ev range just above ionization threshold of fe  xvii .",
    "the set of ( @xmath93 for all these resonances have been computed .",
    "the integrated resonance strengths for the @xmath0 = 18,19 and 20 complexes are 2290.9 , 521.6 , 290.1 @xmath88 ev , compared to experimental values @xcite of 2452.8 , 605.7 , and 336.5 respectively .",
    "again , we find the integrated values to be up to about 10% lower than measured , although here the uncertainties are much greater than for the lower-@xmath0 @xmath94 resonances in figs .",
    "7b , c , d since they may not have been completely resolved and because the integration energy ranges are very closely spaced . also , the precise range of angular momenta @xmath95 in the ion storage rings is not known @xcite , and @xmath96 7 may not be quite sufficient for perfect agreement . detailed comparison of resonances beyond this level is neither feasible nor necessary .",
    "although not all resonances are experimentally identified , the theoretical cross sections , resonance strengths , and rates ( see below ) can be compared , as shown , to within experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "finally we evaluate quantities of practical interest , the maxwellian averaged unified recombination rate coefficients @xmath97 shown in fig .  8 .",
    "these are compared with the sum of the available experimental dr rate coefficients @xcite , and the background rr - type contribution extracted from the present theoretical cross sections .",
    "the agreement is of the order of 20% , the estimated uncertainty in both the experimental and theoretical datasets .",
    "however , we believe that the agreement could be slightly better since the theoretical results might be somewhat enhanced if the few @xmath48 symmetries with @xmath98 , for resonances with @xmath99 , are also included . these were omitted to reduce the complexity of calculations ( except to gauge their effect on the completeness of the @xmath0 = 8 complex mentioned above ) , and since their resonant contribution is small .",
    "thus far only the low energy @xmath6 resonances due to the @xmath101 levels of fe  xviii have been considered . however , as demonstrated in this work , the high energy recombination cross sections due to the @xmath0 = 3 levels are much larger and will be more important at high temperatures close to the temperature of maximum abundance of fe  xvii in collisional equilibrium , around @xmath102 k. this would especially be the case owing to the huge pec resonances shown in fig .  4 that in fact correspond to the peak values of dr due to resonances converging on to the series limits of strong dipole @xmath103 transitions .",
    "therefore , in addition to the dr bump corresponding to the @xmath0 = 2 resonances in the total @xmath97 shown in fig .  8",
    ", we expect a much larger bump at higher temperatures from the @xmath0 = 3 resonances .",
    "however , the 60cc calculations are orders of magnitude more expensive in terms of computational and other resources and , although they are in progress , would require a considerable amount of time to be completed .",
    "in addition to photoionization and recombination the bprm calculations also enable unprecedented quantities of accurate bound state and transition probability datasets in intermediate coupling ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the accuracy of these results is comparable to the most elaborate configuration - interaction atomic structure calculations since the wavefunction in eq .",
    "2.1 entails a large configuration expansion , with each closed channel as a bound configuration of the system for @xmath104 and given symmetry @xmath48 .",
    "these calculations are in progress for all fine structure levels of fe  xvii up to @xmath0 = 10 , and all associated e1 @xmath105- and @xmath106-values .",
    "table 3 provides a brief sample of the bound level energies computed for some of the levels of interest in this work .",
    "together with the electron impact excitation collision strengths for fe  xvii in progress @xcite , these results should help complete the radiative and collisional data for fe xvii needed for most plasma modeling applications .",
    "the most extensive relativistic close coupling calculations for photoionization and recombination of an atomic species are reported for the astrophysically important ion fe  xvii . based on this work",
    "we may note the following conclusions : ( i ) self - consistent datasets may be obtained for photoionization and recombination within the close coupling formulation , ( ii ) the coupling to the @xmath0 = 3 thresholds strongly manifests itself in excited state photoionization ; resonances enhance the effective cross sections by orders of magnitude particularly below thresholds coupled via dipole photoexcitation - of - core levels , ( iii ) unified recombination cross sections are in good agreement with experimental data in terms of both detailed resonance strengths and rates ; the resonances have been delineated at very high resolution with considerably more structure than experimentally observed ( in principle all quantum mechanically allowed resonances in intermediate coupling may be obtained ) , ( iv ) it is necessary to consider the higher @xmath0 = 3 levels in high energy recombination that would dominate the dr part of the 1817 recombination at temperatures close to maximum abundance of fe  xvii in coronal ( collisional ) equilibrium , and ( v ) it is necessary to account for not only relativistic fine structure but also the strong coupling among those levels in order to accurately reproduce the results for photoionization and recombination over the entire range of practical interest .",

    "<S> while the simpler 3-level results describe the near - threshold photoionization and recombination , they are inadequate for practical applications that also require the higher energy cross sections for modeling ionization balance of fe  xvii in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas . the present 60-level results should provide reasonably complete and accurate datasets for both photoionization and recombination of fe  xvii .    # </S>",
