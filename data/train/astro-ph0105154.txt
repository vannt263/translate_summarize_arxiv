    "brown dwarf candidates have been discovered in large numbers in many star formation regions and very young stellar clusters , through deep infrared photometric searches ( eg .",
    "comeron et al .",
    "1993,1996 ; mccaughrean et al .",
    "1995 ; bejar , zapatero - osorio & rebolo 1999 ) .",
    "some of these surveys have yielded objects of planetary mass , in the chamaeleon i molecular cloud ( tamura et al.1998 ; oasa et al.1999 ) in the @xmath10-orionis cluster ( zapatero - osorio et al.2000 ) and in the trapezium cluster in orion ( lucas & roche 2000 , hereafter paper i ; hillenbrand & carpenter 2000 ) . in most cases there is a very high probability that photometric candidates are indeed substellar cluster members .",
    "some candidates with near infrared @xmath11 photometry exhibit @xmath3 bandpass excesses due to hot circumstellar dust , which demonstrate their youth ( eg .",
    "oasa et al.1999 ) , although this criterion will miss the majority of young stellar objects ( ysos ) . in the trapezium cluster , even substellar candidates without @xmath3 bandpass excesses",
    "can generally be assumed to be cluster members because any measured extinction precludes confusion with foreground field dwarfs while the dense backdrop of the omc-1 cloud and the high galactic latitude ( b=18@xmath12 ) both mitigate against background contamination .",
    "it is still important to observe brown dwarf candidates spectroscopically , both to confirm their status and to explore the rich physics of their atmospheres , which have much lower gravities than their evolved counterparts .",
    "there are effects specific to very young sources which complicate the interpretation of their spectra .",
    "these are : ( 1 ) light scattered and emitted by circumstellar matter , which modifies the signal from the photosphere ; ( 2 ) reddening by the cluster medium , which can only be imperfectly removed ; ( 3 ) the lower gravity of the atmosphere .",
    "the low gravities mean that the spectra can not be simply compared to those of class v dwarfs and such spectra have not been successfully modelled in the near infrared until now . however , the new ames - dusty-1999 models of allard et al.(2000 , 2001 ) which employ the nasa ames water line list and a more detailed treatment of dust , appear to be considerably more successful than previous models ( see section 4 ) .",
    "evidence for low gravity spectral features has been seen in the pleiades ( martin , rebolo & zapatero - osorio 1996 ) which have an age of @xmath13  myr .",
    "luhman & rieke ( 1998 ) and luhman et al.(1998a ) published optical spectroscopy of large samples of ysos in ic348 and l1495e , including some substellar objects .",
    "they allowed for the effects of low gravity by fitting spectra to templates formed from the average of class v dwarfs and class iii giants , which produced a good match to the data .",
    "however this approach is not appropriate for the very low mass sources in the trapezium and @xmath10-orionis , since the few good quality infrared spectra of late - m type class iii and class i giants in the literature ( eg .",
    "lancon & rocca - volmerange 1992 ) do not have similar profiles to those presented here , and correspond to even lower gravity objects ( @xmath14 .",
    "moreover there are no l - type giants to compare with the cooler sources found in orion .",
    "wilking , greene & meyer ( 1999 ) analysed @xmath3 bandpass spectra of brown dwarfs in @xmath15 ophiuchus by comparison with class v dwarfs , which may lead to errors in the derived effective temperatures .",
    "we experienced the same problem in paper i when deriving temperatures and luminosities by comparison with class v @xmath16 colours .",
    "fortuitously this does not appear to have caused significant errors because : ( a ) many sources with low extinction were observed with _",
    "( j - h)=0.5 to 0.6 , indicating that this colour does not increase to red giant branch values ( _ ( j - h ) @xmath17 ) in very young brown dwarfs and ( b ) the ames - dusty-1999 models indicate that low gravity causes only small changes in the broad band colours , comparable to our typical photometric uncertainty of 0.1 magnitudes .",
    "_ _    in this paper we present low resolution @xmath1 and @xmath3 bandpass spectra of a sample of trapezium cluster members including low mass stars , brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects .",
    "the spectra are analysed by comparison with both the ames - dusty-1999 models and published spectra of class v dwarfs .",
    "optical spectra will be presented in a future paper .",
    "new photometric data are also presented covering the southern region of the trapezium cluster .",
    "we also readdress the arguments concerning the nature of these sources , in light of the spectroscopic data .",
    "in this paper we use the less controversial but not very descriptive term planetary mass objects to describe sources below the deuterium burning threshold .",
    "some in the extrasolar planets community object to the term free floating planets to describe objects which are not orbiting a star and probably form in a molecular cloud core in a manner similar to stars ( although the word planet originally meant wanderer ) . as a possible alternative , we suggest the more compact term planetar as a contraction of planetary mass object believed to have formed like a star. a large amount of theoretical work is now in progress , examining a variety of different formation scenarios",
    ". there may prove to be more than one mode of formation for these low mass bodies , as is believed to be the case for stars .",
    "long slit spectroscopy of sources in the trapezium cluster was carried out at the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on 27 - 30 november 1999 , using cgs4 , a near infrared cooled grating spectrograph .",
    "the observer was pwl .",
    "sources were observed in pairs aligned along the slit of the spectrograph and the sample was selected from the dataset of paper i and the new imaging data presented here , with the intention of sampling the mass range from 0.008 to 0.10 m@xmath0 , i.e. from planetary mass to very low mass stars .",
    "21 such sources were observed and 2 sources of higher mass .",
    "there were the following additional criteria .",
    "( 1 ) location in a region of low nebular surface brightness in order to improve sensitivity . ( 2 )",
    "low extinction towards at least one member of a pair , defined by _ ( j - h ) @xmath18 or a(v)@xmath19 , also to improve sensitivity .",
    "( 3 ) most sources were selected for normal _",
    "( i - j ) colours in an attempt to minimise contamination by light scattered from circumstellar matter ( see paper i ) but 2 sources with the anomalously blue colours shared by 14% of the cluster population were observed to see whether their spectra were different from the others .",
    "( 4 ) location within @xmath20 of a sufficiently bright star ( @xmath8 mag @xmath21 ) to permit precise location of optically invisible targets within the slit by offsetting to the target . in practice ,",
    "all 21 of the low mass targets were located at least 105 arcsec west of @xmath22 orionis c at the cluster centre . _ _    cgs4 has a 256@xmath23256 insb array sensitive from 1 - 5.5  @xmath2 m and a spatial scale of 0.62 arcsec / pixel .",
    "the 40 l / mm grating was used in first order , which yields a spectral dispersion of 25 nm / pixel but a 1.2wide slit was employed in most cases , yielding an instrumental profile with a width of 50 nm .",
    "this corresponds to a spectral resolution of r=330 in the @xmath1 bandpass and r=440 at @xmath3 .",
    "the wide slit was used to ensure that most of the flux from both members of a widely separated pair would fall in the slit .",
    "each spectrum covers a 0.62  @xmath2 m wavelength range .",
    "the @xmath1 bandpass spectra were centred at 1.65  @xmath2 m and the @xmath3 bandpass spectra at 2.2  @xmath2 m , overlapping in the 1.9  @xmath2 m region .",
    "one pair of sources was observed at 25 nm resolution with a 0.6slit , though not in very good conditions ; no additional narrow line features were revealed .",
    "this pair of sources was observed with @xmath1 bandpass spectra centred at 1.58  @xmath2 m on the first night , in attempt to include the steep @xmath8 band water edge at 1.34  @xmath2 m , but the instrument efficiency in this configuration was found to be essentially zero for wavelengths @xmath24 m , so the longer wavelength setting was used thereafter .",
    "the relative throughput of the instrument and the atmosphere in the @xmath1 bandpass is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the observations and source notes are detailed in table 1 . for all other pairs ,",
    "the array was stepped over 2 pixels in a whole pixel step to remove bad pixels and the telescope was nodded along the slit in order to subtract the background , with background - limited individual integrations of 30 to 60  s duration .",
    "total exposures time ranged from 10 minutes for the brightest sources to 1.5 hours for the faintest .",
    "21 primary sources were observed in the @xmath1 bandpass and 11 of these in the @xmath3 bandpass also .",
    "we also present @xmath1 bandpass spectra of 2 fairly low mass sources which appeared in the long slit by chance .",
    "the smaller number of @xmath3 bandpass observations was due to constraints on observing time ( weather and computer failures ) .",
    "priority was given to @xmath1 bandpass observations because of anticipated complications owing to emission by hot dust in the @xmath3 bandpass and because the water absorption troughs are slightly more prominent in the @xmath1 bandpass .",
    "a small number of red main sequence stars were also observed in order to check the reliability of the data .",
    "their spectra agree very well with those published by leggett et al.(2000 ) for the same objects , also obtained with cgs4 at ukirt .",
    "the data were coadded into background subtracted reduced groups using the cgs4dr software package and spectra were optimally extracted using the twodspec package in iraf , the image reduction and analysis facility .",
    "argon arc spectra , tungsten lamp flatfields and standard stars were observed frequently to compensate for changes in the wavelength calibration when the slit orientation was changed and to accurately correct for the changing telluric water vapour column density .",
    "f - type stellar standards were generally used in preference to a - types since they have weaker hi absorption lines .",
    "the fairly weak brackett series lines were removed from the stellar standards by fitting the continuum with a high order cubic spline , dividing the fit by the data to produce a line spectrum , and multiplying the data by the line spectrum .",
    "the strong paschen @xmath25 line at 1.875  @xmath2 m coincides with a deep trough due to telluric water absorption and could not be adequately removed , so we have removed a small section of the spectra near this wavelength .",
    "the brackett series limit occurs at 1.46  @xmath2 m and coincides with a narrow telluric feature at the short wavelength edge of the @xmath1 bandpass , making it impossible to accurately remove .",
    "inspection of the nextgen models of hauschildt et al.(1997 ) indicates that the brackett series limit is weaker than the telluric feature in f - type standards and it does not appear to be noticeable in the spectra presented here .",
    "in addition to background shot - noise , a significant source of noise arises from the spatial gradients in the nebular surface brightness , which make the background subtraction difficult . owing to these gradients",
    "the reduced group images are not flat , but show the effects of subtracting two frames separated by distance of the nod along the sky : either 10 or 20 arcsec was used depending on the separation between the members of a pair .",
    "the images also show the spectral residuals due to fluctuations in the strength of telluric oh emission lines .",
    "a polynomial was interactively fitted to the residual background at each wavelength and subtracted , using the apall package in twodspec , and this procedure was generally very successful in removing both nebulosity gradients and residual oh emission .",
    "the problem was greatest for the fainter sources , whose peak brightness is comparable to fluctuations in nebular suface brightness on a scale of a few arcsec , even for sources selected in regions of low nebular background .",
    "where necessary , 2 iterations were used to produce a flat background . for the faintest sources ,",
    "the background may be slightly over or under subtracted , but agreement between spectra taken at the two nod positions was used as a check to prevent this occuring .",
    "only one spectrum was lost due to this problem : the @xmath3 bandpass spectrum of the faintest source , 051 - 147 , was rendered useless by a small step in the surface brightness on the same scale as the nod length , but an @xmath1 bandpass spectrum was successfully extracted .",
    "we recommend that a nod length of 5 arcsec or less be used in star formation regions when taking long slit spectra of faint sources .",
    "additional photometry in the _ ijh bands was obtained at ukirt , using the infrared camera ufti , in the manner described in paper i , using 900  s exposures .",
    "the new data were taken on the nights of 11 - 12 november 1999 by observatory staff .",
    "they consisted of three contiguous 1.5 arcmin ufti fields located 3 arcmin south of @xmath22 ori c , oriented east - west as shown in figure 2 .",
    "this region was selected because our existing data indicated that the nebular surface brightness and average extinction would be low in this region , and published @xmath3 bandpass maps showed that the stellar density is reasonably high ( hillenbrand 1997 ) .",
    "these features assisted in the detection of some new very faint sources , as described in section 3.1 .",
    "the seeing conditions were fairly good , with a fwhm of 0.5 - 0.6 in all three filters , aided by the tip / tilt image stabilisation of the ukirt secondary mirror .",
    "_    figure 2 : @xmath8 bandpass image of the full photometric dataset .",
    "the region of new data is below the horizontal line .",
    "the spectroscopic sample was taken from sources to the west of the brightest nebulosity .",
    "the locations of very low mass candidates ( dereddened mag j@xmath26 , or m@xmath270.016",
    "m@xmath0 ) are marked with circles .",
    "photometry was performed using the daophot crowded field photometry package in iraf as in paper i , using both manual photometry and automated crowded field photometry .",
    "the former was generally preferred in order to accurately subtract the highly structured nebulous background , except when the image profiles of sources overlapped significantly .",
    "several sources were contained in the overlap region between the new data and the dataset of paper i. the measured magnitudes typically differed by 0.1 mag or less , which is approximately the photometric error described in paper i. the main source of error in the brighter sources is the image profiles , which are spatially variable in the overlap region since this is t the very edge of both the old and new datasets .",
    "each ufti field is made up of a 9-point image mosaic with small jitters .",
    "the @xmath8 band magnitude system for ufti at ukirt has recently been updated by observatory staff , who discovered that the transformations from the old ircam system to the new ufti system are different for cool red stars than other main sequence stars .",
    "this is because these stars have water absorption bands in similar locations to the water bands in the earth s atmosphere and ufti employs the new @xmath8 band filter developed for the mauna kea consortium , optimised for the low water column above this observing site .",
    "the new transformation has been thoroughly calibrated via measurements of late m type and l type stars . since our paper",
    "i dataset was calibrated using red stars ( in order to calculate transformations from cousins @xmath28 to the ufti @xmath28 band ) this requires us to update our @xmath8 band photometry , and consequently the i band transformations also ( see ukirt web pages for the details ) .",
    "the new @xmath8 band magnitudes are typically 0.1 magnitudes brighter than before , which leads to a slightly lower luminosity for sources with significant extinction , since the calculated extinction is reduced .",
    "sources with near zero extinction are slightly more luminous than had been thought .",
    "however changes of this order are of very little consequence , since the mass - luminosity relation is quite steep throughout the brown dwarf regime and the change is similar to both the typical photometric uncertainty and the theoretical uncertainty in the mass - luminosity conversion .",
    "the bolometric correction,@xmath29 , formerly used to convert dereddened @xmath8 magnitudes , @xmath30 , to luminosities is also updated in consequence :    @xmath31    the new models used here predict the fluxes in each filter directly without the need for a bolometric correction .",
    "43 new sources were detected at both @xmath8 and @xmath1 bands in the new data , of which 31 were detected at @xmath28 band .",
    "a colour - luminosity plot , with the new data added to that of paper i , is shown in figure 3 for all 557 unsaturated sources .",
    "we plot 2 different 1  myr isochrones as almost vertical solid lines at the left of the picture , to which sources may be dereddened . both of these are self consistent predictions using the same model atmospheres for colour predictions and to provide the boundary condition for the evolutionary calculations .",
    "this removes the need to use uncertain bolometric corrections .",
    "furthest to the left is an isochrone supplied by baraffe et al.(2001 , in preparation ) , using the non - gray ames - dusty-1999 model atmospheres ( allard et al.2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "the isochrone slightly to the right is the prediction of baraffe et al.(1998 ) , recently extended to 1  myr and to the deuterium burning threshold ( chabrier et al.2000 ) .",
    "this second isochrone has evolution and colours based upon the nextgen model atmospheres .",
    "it is useful to see both because the nextgen atmospheres correctly predict the colours of main sequence stars with effective temperatures above 2500  k , whereas the ames - dusty models are successfully fit the colours of field brown dwarfs , below 2200  k , where dust has an important influence on the photosphere .",
    "the temperature at the deuterium burning threshold lies near the low temperature end of the nextgen regime but we can not be sure which model will predict the _ ( j - h ) colours better in very young , low gravity photospheres .",
    "the true colour probably lies between the 2 predictions , as discussed below . _",
    "( 200,290 )    ( 0,0 )    figure 3 : colour - magnitude diagram for the 557 unsaturated @xmath8 bandpass sources .",
    "two theoretical 1  myr isochrones are plotted at left , with reddening lines indicated for 0.08  m@xmath0 and the 0.012  m@xmath0 deuterium threshold .",
    "open circles represent sources with large @xmath8 band photometric uncertainties ( @xmath320.2 mag ) .",
    "recalibrated photometry of the full dataset is available electronically .",
    "the odell & wong ( 1996 ) coordinate based naming system is used as in paper i. the advantageous features of the new dataset , as described above , permitted the detection of some very low luminosity sources : 4 new planetary mass candidates , 3 of which appear to be less massive than any of the sources described in paper i , assuming an age of 1  myr and employing either the isochrones of burrows et al.(1997 , hereafter bm97 ) or the new isochrone of baraffe et al .",
    "however only 1 of these 3 faint sources has good photometry : 189 - 659 has @xmath33 , which indicates a notional mass of 6.2 m@xmath7 at 1  myr ( on the bm97 isochrone ) and apparently negligible extinction .",
    "the other 2 sources have large photometric uncertainties in both the @xmath8 and @xmath1 bands , so their masses are highly uncertain .",
    "intriguingly , these 3 faint sources are all located close together on the sky , in a 1 arcmin square region 3 arcmin due south of @xmath22 ori c , on the far side of the orion bar from the cluster centre .",
    "the orion bar is the ionisation front of the omc-1 cloud , viewed edge - on as it curves into the line of sight .",
    "sources which are located beyond it lie on lines of sight passing deep into the molecular cloud .",
    "hence we might expect such sources to be younger than the rest of the cluster and hence less massive for a given luminosity .",
    "however , the very low extinction toward 189 - 659 indicates that this source probably lies in front of the cloud and might possibly be a minimum mass star in the foreground .",
    "the locations of all the sources with dereddened @xmath8 magnitudes @xmath34 ( i.e. m@xmath35 0.012 to 0.016  m@xmath0 at 1 myr ) are plotted in figure 2 .",
    "there are now @xmath36 15 planetary mass candidates in the dataset , following the filter recalibration .",
    "the number of sources below the deuterium burning threshold can not be specified very precisely , mainly because of the uncertainty in the _ ( j - h ) colour of their photospheres mentioned earlier .",
    "most evolutionary calculations are in very good agreement concerning the minimum mass for deuterium burning , at 0.012 - 0.013  m@xmath0 ( saumon et al.1996 ; bm97 ; chabrier et al.2000 ) . in addition , the 1  myr isochrones of bm97 , dantona & mazzitelli ( 1998 ) ( herafter dm98 , update to 1997 publication ) and baraffe et al.(1998 ) are in fair agreement ( within 0.2 to 0.3 mag ) with regard to source luminosities for low mass brown dwarfs",
    ". however , the small uncertainty in the _ ( j - h ) colours can slightly change the number of planetary mass objects by moving the lines of constant mass in figure 3 to the right or to the left by 0.1 - 0.15 mag , since a number of sources appear to lie very close to the deuterium burning threshold . applying the new baraffe et al .",
    "isochrone , there are @xmath3713 planetary mass objects ( below the m@xmath38m@xmath0 threshold calculated by chabrier et al . ) , whereas the nextgen - based baraffe et al .",
    "ischrone indicates there are 16 such objects . using the main sequence colours and bolometric corrections as in paper i , and the bm97 isochrone for luminosity ,",
    "indicates that there are 15 such objects .",
    "given that the @xmath8 bandpass photometric errors are typically 0.1 - 0.2 mag for these faint candidates , the important issue is not the precise number but whether the imf extends below the deuterium burning threshold , which appears to be the case .",
    "_ _    the nextgen colour predictions , using the miller - tennyson water line list , are only very slightly too red for main sequence stars but these atmospheres poorly reproduce the observed profiles of both field dwarfs with strong water absorption ( leggett et al . 2001 ) and the low gravity spectra presented here . the ames - dusty-1999 colour predictions , using the nasa ames water line list ( partridge & schwenke 1997 ) , are 0.1 to 0.2 mag too blue in main sequence stars ( see allard , hauschildt & schwenke 2000 ) but reproduce the profiles of the spectra presented here quite well . a small colour discrepancy in _ ( j - h ) would appear to arise from incompleteness in the water line list in the 1.7 - 2.2  @xmath2 m water absorption band , which is shown directly for trapezium sources in section 4.1 . _    note that we have made a conservative choice of reddening law ( see paper i ) .",
    "the choice has little effect in any case because the planetary mass candidates necessarily have low extinction and because extinction laws have little variation in the infrared ( see cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) ) except in extremely dense environments such as the accretion disks of embedded protostars , which may contain dust grains larger than 1  @xmath2 m in radius",
    ".    there may be small but unquantified effects on the _",
    "( j - h ) colours due to scattering by circumstellar matter and a small percentage of emission by hot circumstellar dust in some cases .",
    "hot dust would make sources appear slightly redder ( see section 4 ) and overmassive ; the direction of any scattering effect depends very much on assumptions about the circumstellar structure and viewing angle .",
    "the additional uncertainties of cluster membership and candidate ages are discussed in section 6 . _    _ erratum _",
    "we note that 1 planetary mass candidate from paper i was found to be double counted owing to a typing error .",
    "an internal cross check of all the coordinates shows that this is the only such case in the dataset of 557 unsaturated sources detected in the @xmath8 and @xmath1 bandpasses .",
    "21 @xmath1 band spectra were taken of sources with masses m @xmath39m@xmath0 .",
    "these are plotted in figure 4(a - c ) , as f@xmath40 spectra in order to suppress the apparent noise at short wavelengths .",
    "dereddened spectra are plotted above the observed spectra for those sources with non - zero extinction .",
    "these spectra are not flux calibrated since for some observations observing conditions were not photometric .",
    "the fainter sources are gaussian - smoothed to enhance low resolution features .",
    "nearly all of the spectra are dominated by strong water absorption bands to either side of a sharp peak located between 1.68 and 1.70  @xmath2 m .",
    "the exceptions are plotted in the lower part of figure 4(b ) .",
    "no real narrow spectral features are unambiguously detected in the @xmath1 bandpass .",
    "pixel to pixel variations therefore illustrate the noise in each spectrum , which has wavelength dependent contributions from narrow telluric oh emission lines and broad band telluric water absorption , both of which vary on a timescale of minutes during an exposure .",
    "the noise is most obvious in very faint sources such as 084 - 104 ( figure 4(c ) ) in which many spurious narrow features remain despite some smoothing .",
    "the data quality is poor in the 1.8 - 1.95@xmath41 m region owing to strong telluric water absorption and also becomes less reliable at @xmath42 m , due to both telluric water absorption and the declining instument efficiency .",
    "some of the spectra are strongly reddened , with the result that the water absorption appears weaker on the long wavelength side of the peak and stronger on the short wavelength side , eg .",
    "object 013 - 306 . in most cases",
    "the effect is minor owing to our preferential selection of sources with low extinction .",
    "the extinction toward each source is calculated using the @xmath16 photometry , by comparison with measured main sequence star colours as described in paper i , and noted in figure 4(a - c ) .",
    "the deredden task in iraf was used , which is based on the cardelli , clayton & mathis extinction law , with reddening parameter r@xmath43=5.5 as before and a(@xmath44 ) @xmath45 in the infrared .",
    "this is a somewhat imprecise procedure , because our typical photometric uncertainty of 0.1 mag in each filter leads to an uncertainty of 0.14 mag in the _ ( j - h ) colour , which corresponds to an uncertainty of 0.25 mag in @xmath1 band extinction and 1.2 mag in @xmath46 band extinction .",
    "however , the errors will be less for the brighter sources in the region of the spectroscopic sample , which was selected for faint nebulous background .",
    "the use of main sequence colours gives similar results to the nextgen atmospheres : the atmospheric models predict changes of no more than @xmath37 0.1 mag in _ ( j - h ) due to lower gravity in young sources , so we do not think this uncertainty will be larger than measurement error . _",

    "masses derived from the bm97 1  myr isochrone are indicated .",
    "the noise is indicated by the pixel to pixel variations , since no narrow spectral features are detected in the h bandpass .",

    "figure 4(c ) : observed and dereddened @xmath1 bandpass spectra for the least massive candidates , with some gaussian smoothing applied .",
    "the apparent absence of flux at @xmath47 m in 023 - 115 is attributed to the decline in signal / noise at those wavelengths , due to atmosphere , instrument efficiency , extinction and ( presumed ) water absorption in the source itself .",
    "the peaked @xmath1 bandpass profiles in figure 4(a - c ) are very different from those of late m and l - type dwarfs in the local neighborhood with strong water absorption bands , as shown by our spectra of 2 red standards in figure 5(a - b ) , compared with a composite spectrum of the orion sources .",
    "the composite spectrum is an average of 12 reasonably high quality spectra with fairly strong water absorption , weighted according to the apparent noise in each spectrum .",
    "the composite has slightly weaker water absorption than the average of the sample , since it is weighted toward warmer , brighter sources near the stellar / substellar boundary .",
    "comparison with the data of leggett et al.(2001 ) ( overplotted in figure 5(a ) ) for the same red standards demonstrates that the spectra are reliable and the differences from field stars are real . in spectra of field",
    "dwarfs there is strong water absorption at @xmath48 m and @xmath49 m , but a shallower slope in between , which appears as a flat plateau in f@xmath50 plots of the data ( figure 5(b ) ) .",
    "this is clearly seen in the f@xmath50 plots of a large sample of late m and l dwarfs presented by leggett et al.2001 .",
    "marked by clear changes in slope at 1.70  @xmath2 m and in the 1.55 - 1.60  @xmath2 m interval .",
    "the peaked profiles of the trapezium objects , which show no plateau , appear to be a consistent signature of youth and cluster membership .",
    "they are modelled in section 4 .",

    "the spectral types are uncertain by a few subtypes due to the low snr and the possibility of imperfect background subtraction but they are derived by a reddening independent method , so extinction does not affect the typing .",
    "alternative water - based derivations of spectral type could lead to earlier classifications , e.g. the delfosse slope - based water index ( see section 4 ) which samples the steepest part of the water absorption in field dwarfs and not the plateau .",

    "the earlier m - types are less common than the later types but would be detectable to a greater distance , so the distribution would be fairly even across spectral types m0-m6 . since they are not seen among our planetary mass candidates we suspect that hc have underestimated the extinction for 2 reasons .",

    "ward - thompson et al.1994 ) but it is consistent with the near infrared and @xmath116co data .",
    "the second reason to expect significant extinction is that hc used an optical : infrared extinction conversion based on the interstellar medium , which significantly underestimates the infrared extinction in orion ( cardelli et al . ) because of the presence of slightly larger dust grains in the environment of the molecular cloud .",
    "the substantial contribution of these slightly larger grains to extinction can be seen from calculations using mie theory ( eg .",

    "the measured infrared extinction may be local to the young star .",

    "a large population of field sources would be expected to produce a broader profile at infrared wavelengths , since these sources are uniformly distributed and more easily seen at the edges of the cluster , where extinction is lower .",
    "this argument was first used by hillenbrand & hartmann ( 1998 ) but not at such faint sensitivity limits .",
    "we apply it here using our @xmath28 and @xmath1 bandpass data , in figure 19 , plotting the number of detections in each filter as a function of distance from @xmath22  ori  c. inspection of the profile gives no hint of a background population since the ratio of @xmath1:@xmath28 bandpass detections is fairly uniform and may even decrease slightly between radii of 200 and 300 arcsec .",
    "this demonstrates that any population of faint sources ( @xmath124 to be undetected at @xmath28 ) must be small in order to have no observable impact on the cluster profile .",
    "this method is not precise enough to exclude the presence of a small background population and there are selection effects in figure 19 because the detectabilty of sources increases more rapidly at large radii in the @xmath28 bandpass than at @xmath1 , owing to the greater effect of the nebular background at @xmath28 .",
    "nevertheless , the absence of any obvious background population in the profile at @xmath1 suggests that contamination is likely to be small at @xmath8 .",
    "( 200,290 )    ( 0,0 )    figure 19 : trapezium cluster profile n(r)dr as a function of distance from @xmath22 ori c. solid lines show @xmath28 band detections , dashed lines show @xmath1 band detections .",
    "the profile is incomplete beyond 160 arcsec because the survey region is not circular , but extends to the west .",
    "could the planetary mass objects be foreground dwarfs ?",
    "about half of the 15 candidates have sufficient reddening , _ ( j - h ) @xmath1250.85 ( ufti system ) or _ ( j - h ) @xmath1250.94 on the cit system , for us to be confident that they are significantly reddened .",
    "only field dwarfs of type l2 and later can reach these colours according to kirkpatrick et al.(2000 ) ( or l6 and later according to the smaller sample of leggett et al .",
    "these provide very small contamination , since mid and late l - types are only detected at small distances , sampling a much smaller volume than late m - types m@xmath126 ) .",
    "kirkpatrick et al.(2000 ) the expected number of foreground objects is only 5 or 6 in the full survey region ( @xmath127 contamination ) according to both the tinney et al.(1993 ) luminosity function and the 2mass data ( reid et al.1999 ) , mainly m dwarfs in magnitude range @xmath128 .",
    "we expect to detect @xmath129 foreground l dwarf in the full survey region of 40  arcmin@xmath121 , using the space density estimate of zapatero - osorio et al.(2000 ) .",
    "although the volume density of field l dwarfs is uncertain , the number can not rise by more than a factor of 3 , since zapatero - osorio et al . calculated 33% contamination in their much larger survey area at very similar galactic coordinates ( contamination can not exceed 100% ) .",
    "planetary mass candidates ( @xmath130  m@xmath0 ) are detected in no more than 60% or our survey area , where the nebular surface brightness is sufficiently low .",
    "hence , we derive an upper limit of 1 or 2 late m and l type sources which could appear to be planetary mass objects . _ _",
    "the interpretation of very faint cluster members as planetary mass objects might be incorrect if they are far older ( @xmath131myr ) than the bulk of the higher mass cluster members .",
    "the luminosity of a 0.020  m@xmath0 object does not decline to that of the 6 candidates with m@xmath132  m@xmath0 until an age of 27  myr , according to the bm97 calculations .",
    "the age distribution of the population has been studied in detail by hillenbrand ( 1997 ) over the wider orion nebula cluster , within a radius of 20 arcmin , using 2 evolutionary tracks in the hr diagram .",
    "this analysis concluded that most star formation in orion has occurred within the past 2  myr and that the youngest sources are highly concentrated towards the cluster centre , which is the region covered by our relatively small scale survey .",
    "the dataset did not include planetary mass sources but indicated that the lowest mass and highest mass sources are most strongly concentrated toward the cluster centre , with less concentration by intermediate ( solar mass ) sources .",
    "specifically , hillenbrand calculated that @xmath133 of the population has an age @xmath12520  myr , using the dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) tracks , which agree well with more recent calculations ( bm97 ; dantona & mazzitelli 1998 , baraffe et al . ) .",
    "the swenson et al.(1994 ) tracks , which indicated lower temperatures for brown dwarfs than more recent calculations , put the proportion at @xmath134 , which gives some indication of the uncertainty in this type of calculation . conservatively",
    ", we assume that the old ( @xmath135  myr ) population is only a factor of 3 less concentrated within our survey region ( radius @xmath1364 arcmin ) than the young population ( see figure 22 of hillenbrand 1997 ) .",
    "this yields a contamination of 0.6%-1.7% by such old objects in our sample , or 4 to 11 objects spread over all masses in the sample of @xmath137 sources detected at both @xmath8 and @xmath1 ( including bright saturated sources ) .",
    "the more recent assessment of the age distribution in the core of the cluster by hc gave a similar result . expressed as n@xmath138 , the imf in orion has been demonstrated to have a broad maximum somewhere between 0.1 and 0.6  m@xmath0 ( paper i , hc , luhman et al.2000 ) and decline slowly at substellar masses . in the 0.03 - 0.08  m@xmath0 interval",
    "a relation n@xmath139 is consistent with our data in paper i. if this trend continues below our completeness limit to 0.013  m@xmath0 , then we would expect there to be @xmath140 to 0.44 old brown dwarfs with sufficiently low mass ( @xmath141 to @xmath142  m  @xmath64 ) to masquerade as a planetary mass object .",
    "even if the substellar imf were flat we would not expect there to be more than 1 such source , whereas there are @xmath143 planetary mass candidates . in the event of a flat substellar imf it would be difficult to argue for an abrupt cut off above the deuterium threshold .",
    "we note that the status of 1 brown dwarf candidate , 014 - 413 as a youthful trapezium cluster member has been confirmed by direct imaging of a wind bow shock interaction with the cluster medium in h@xmath25 in a hubble space telescope survey ( bally , odell & mccaughrean 2000 ) which unfortunately overlaps only a small part of the spectroscopic survey region . outflow activity is correlated with accretion rate in ysos , which decreases with age .",
    "hence , this is probably a younger than average cluster member , which is also indicated by the presence of a large @xmath3 bandpass excess in figure 8(a ) .",
    "@xmath3 bandpass excesses are a good indicator of youth , since they are most common at ages @xmath129myr .",
    "is there evidence for @xmath3 bandpass excesses in our planetary mass candidates ?",
    "6/15 of our planetary mass candidates were detected in the @xmath1 and @xmath3 bandpass data of hc , which only partially overlaps our survey area .",
    "these can be dereddened with the addition of our @xmath8 bandpass data .",
    "the @xmath1 bandpass fluxes measured by hc agree well with ours in 3/6 cases , the measurements differing by @xmath144 magnitudes , see table 5 .",
    "we note that the 3/6 sources with poor agreement all lie near the edge of the survey of hc , and are believed to suffer from substantially shorter exposure times ( 25  s or 50  s total ) , whereas the other 3 are believed to have the full 100  s exposure time .",
    "the poor agreement is therefore probably due to low snrs in the hc data , given that all these faint sources are near the sensitivity limits of both surveys .",
    "alternatively , large amplitude variability may occur in a small minority of sources , which has been demonstrated at stellar mass by carpenter , hillenbrand & skrutskie ( 2001 ) .",
    "if we accept that the 3 sources with good agreement have well measured @xmath1 bandpass fluxes , then there appear to be large @xmath3 band excesses in 2/3 cases .",
    "it is risky to compare photometry from different surveys in this way but these colour excesses , e(h - k)@xmath145 magnitudes , are large enough to be fairly convincing despite the uncertainty of order 0.1 mag in the _",
    "( j - h ) colour of the photospheres .",
    "if they are genuine then this indicates that these are very young sources , probably with ages of @xmath1461  myr , and therefore are very good planetary mass candidates .",
    "_    oasa et al.(1999 ) were cautious in interpreting very faint sources in the chamaeleon i cloud as planetary mass objects , despite the detection of large @xmath3 bandpass infrared excesses requiring the presence of a substantial mass of hot dust in the accretion disk .",
    "however they found that even at 10  myr , their presumed upper age limit for sources with substantial quantities of hot dust , a planetary mass was still indicated for their faintest source .    at present",
    ", there is no easy way to actually measure the ages of individual sources because luminosity and temperature are degenerate with respect to mass and age , and because of the need to deredden sources . in principle",
    "the tracks of more massive sources might be separated on an hr diagram ( older , more massive sources should be smaller and hotter than planetary mass objects of equal luminosity ) . at present , however the uncertainty in temperature measurement and prediction at these very early ages is too large to make such a distinction ( see table 3 ) .",
    "a small bias toward greater ages might be expected for the spectroscopic sample of sources with low extinction ( see section 4.3 ) .",
    "precise measurements of surface gravity via high resolution spectroscopy of absorption line profiles may permit this at some future date but this will be difficult owing to the weakness of atomic lines in low gravity atmospheres . a promising alternative would be to use well modelled lines of simple molecules such as co , and perhaps the k@xmath147 index , because some molecular features increase in strength with decreasing gravity . another option might be to search for deuterium , the defining attribute of these free floating planets. deuterium is predicted to be absent in sources more @xmath148 years old , for masses m@xmath149m@xmath0 .",
    "this is illustrated by bejar et al .",
    ", using the calculations of dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) , and examined in more detail by chabrier , baraffe , allard , & hauschildt ( 2000 ) .",
    "we have conducted a pencil beam search for sources in the trapezium even fainter than those deetected in our ukirt survey , using the gemini north telescope with the adaptive optics system hokupaa and the infrared camera quirc .",
    "the data will be described more fully in a future paper but preliminary indications are that no such ultra low luminosity sources were detected in 5 quirc fields containing @xmath150 stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "this tends to support our previous suggestion thet the luminosity function ( lf ) in the trapezium turns down somewhere near 8  m@xmath7 , but this is far from conclusive because of the very small area surveyed and the existence of small scale spatial variation in the imf , as seen in figure 2 ) .",
    "the decline of the lf should be investigated further to see whether it is a feature of the imf or merely of the mass - luminosity relation .",
    "( an attempt at a much larger companion survey with the naomi adaptive optics system at the william herschel telescope was prevented by severe weather . )",
    "there are theoretical arguments for expecting few sources below 10  m@xmath7 ( silk 1977 ; adams & fatuzzo 1996 ) but the physical processes in crowded clusters and multiple star systems may circumvent the obstacles described in those papers .",
    "low resolution @xmath1 and @xmath3 bandpass spectra of brown dwarfs and planetary mass candidates show strong water absorption bands , equivalent in depth to those seen in l - type and late m - type spectra , which is entirely consistent with the predictions of evolutionary tracks ( baraffe et al . , bm97 , dm98 ) at ages near 1  myr .",
    "the new evolutionary tracks provide self consistent flux predictions , permitting luminosities and masses to to be derived without the need for bolometric corrections .",
    "the results are very similar to our previous work",
    ". however , the @xmath1 bandpass profiles shown here are very different from those of field dwarfs with strong water absorption , which appears to be a clear signature of youth and low mass . strong evidence for the expected low surface gravities is provided by fitting the spectra to the ames - dusty-1999 models .",
    "the low gravity models are quite successful at reproducing ( a ) the @xmath1 bandpass profiles ; ( b ) the weakness of co absorption in the @xmath3 bandpass spectra ; and ( c ) the absence of na i absorption at 2.21  @xmath2 m , though with stringent limits in only one source .",
    "there is an excellent correlation between independently derived spectroscopic temperatures and photometric temperatures , with a relatively small systematic offset of 250  k.    spectra of 2 planetary mass candidates and 3 very low mass brown dwarfs ( @xmath151 at 1  myr ) show very strong water absorption consistent with l - type spectra , and have lower spectroscopic temperatures than the higher mass brown dwarfs , which is also predicted by the evolutionary tracks .",
    "the late spectral types confirm that these are cluster members , since they are too luminous to be background field dwarfs and the modest extinction seen in most cases demonstrates that they are not foreground dwarfs .",
    "we would expect many of the l - type sources to show m - type spectra at optical wavelengths , since water absorption is deeper in low gravity dwarfs than high gravity dwarfs , according to the ames - dusty-1999 spectra .",
    "the fitted temperatures are higher than those usually associated with l - type sources .",
    "the trend of co absorption to be significantly weaker at low gravities , for effective temperatures in the range 2100 - 2900  k , is a potentially powerful tool for identifying very young brown dwarfs , provided there is an independent means of measuring the effective temperature .",
    "this trend has been observed before in low gravity giant and supergiant stars ( eg . origlia , moorwood & oliva ) at both 2.3  @xmath2 m and 1.62  @xmath2 m .",
    "while the ages of the individual sources can not be precisely measured , it is very unlikely the 15 photometric planetary mass candidates could be much more massive sources with ages @xmath135  myr , since statistically we would expect @xmath60 such source in our dataset .",
    "there is also some evidence for large @xmath3 bandpass excesses in 2 of the planetary mass candidates , obtained by combining our @xmath152 data with the @xmath59 data of hillenbrand & carpenter 2000 ; however this must be confirmed by a single deep @xmath11 survey .",
    "we wish to thank the staff of ukirt , which is operated by the joint astronomy centre on behalf of the uk particle physics and astronomy research council ( pparc ) .",
    "we are very grateful to sandy leggett for providing her spectroscopic data of field dwarfs electonically , permitting a detailed comparison between these sources and the our substellar candidates without the need to repeat all of the same observations .",
    "we are indebted to isabelle baraffe for providing self consistent theoretical isochrones , without which the interpretation of the photometry would be considerably less secure .",

    "<S> the observation of prominent water vapour bands confirms the low effective temperatures implied by our _ ( i - j ) colour measurements in an earlier paper and would imply late m or l spectral types if these were older field dwarfs . however , the profiles of the @xmath1 bandpass spectra are very different from those of field dwarfs with similar water absorption strength , demonstrating that they are not foreground or background objects . in addition , the co absorption bands at 2.3  @xmath2 m and the nai absorption feature at 2.21  @xmath2 m are very weak for such cool sources . </S>",
    "<S> all these features are quite well reproduced by the ames - dusty-1999 model atmospheres of allard et al.(2000,2001 ) , and arise from the much lower gravities predicted for the trapezium sources ( @xmath5 ) compared to evolved objects ( log g @xmath6 ) , this represents a new proof of the substellar status of our sources , independent of the statistical arguments for low contamination , which are reexamined here . </S>",
