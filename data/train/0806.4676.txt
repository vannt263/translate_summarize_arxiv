    "one of the topics that financial mathematics has been concerned with over the last decades is that of option pricing , and barrier option pricing features prominently among these topics , in particular because barriers can be added to any existing option . in this",
    "regard , merton @xcite obtained in @xmath0 the first pricing formula for a european down - and - out call option by solving explicitly the associated differential equation with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "latter on in 1985 , cox and rubistein   @xcite obtained a similar formula for the up - and - out barrier . using a probabilistic approach based on certain theoretical results derived earlier on by levy   @xcite and by anderson   @xcite , kunitomo and ikeda   @xcite obtained more general pricing formulas for european double barrier options with curved barriers and for a variety of path - dependent options and corporate securities ,",
    "some of which had already been independently obtained for restricted cases in @xcite .",
    "attempts to extend these pricing formulas to the more complex case of american - style options have been undertaken in papers by broadie and detemple   @xcite , gao _ et al _",
    "@xcite , and haug   @xcite .",
    "all of these extensions to american - style options have however only lead to close - form approximations . in parallel with the determination of these pricing formulas ,",
    "numerical methods have been used for pricing barrier options , especially in those cases where analytical pricing solutions remain unavailable , such as for discrete barrier options @xcite , or for american - style options that , in some cases , comprise transaction costs or stochastic volatilities @xcite .",
    "an important problem about barrier options that does nt seem to have been considered is that of deciding when exactly , for a given level of accuracy in option prices , a double barrier option degenerates into a much elementary type of barrier option , as one or more of the pricing parameters change with time .",
    "although this problem is meaningless in terms of the brownian motion of the of the underlying asset price , it becomes fully meaningful in the real word where all prices are known only to within a finite number of precision digits .",
    "it is also a practical problem in the sense that it can lead to a more efficient pricing of various types of barrier options , and to a better insight into the dynamics of options , and more specifically barrier options .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of determining when exactly , as the initial stock price or other pricing parameters evolve , and for a fixed level of accuracy in option prices , a barrier option with a single or a double barrier degenerates into a simpler type of option , which may be , for instance in the case of a double barrier option , a down - and - out or an up - and - out barrier option , or just a vanilla .",
    "we consider in this analysis more general types of barriers with time - dependent absorbing boundaries .",
    "the problem is reduced to finding certain critical values of the initial asset price , and we use a probabilistic approach to derive close - form approximate solutions for these values .",
    "numerical experiments based on analytical option pricing results such as those from @xcite are then implemented , to check the validity of the formulas obtained .    in the next section ,",
    "we derive formulas for the classifying critical asset prices which in section @xmath1 are applied to the problem of classification of barrier options .",
    "we present the numerical test of these formulas in section @xmath2 and give some concluding remarks in section   [ s : conclusion ] . due to the usual parity considerations , we focus our analysis solely on knock - out barrier options .",
    "we make the usual assumption that the stock price @xmath3 follows a geometric brownian motion , or equivalently , that it is lognormally distributed . in this case , the stochastic differential equation satisfied by @xmath4 is given in terms of the standard wienner process @xmath5 by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the constant drift and volatility parameters , respectively .",
    "consider two continuous curves @xmath9 and @xmath10 over the time interval @xmath11,$ ] such that @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a given time .",
    "assume furthermore that the two curves are non - overlapping , so that we have @xmath17 for all @xmath18 a sample path of stock price @xmath3 together with the two adjacent curves are depicted in figure   [ fg : path1 ] .",
    "denote by @xmath19 the accuracy in a given option price @xmath20 for simplicity , we may write @xmath21 in the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of significant digits to the right of the decimal point in @xmath20 suppose now that @xmath24 is the price of a double knock - out option contingent on @xmath25 with curved barriers @xmath26 and @xmath27 for any option under consideration , unless otherwise stated we denote by @xmath28 the initial price of the underlying asset , by @xmath29 its strike price and by @xmath16 its expiry date",
    ". let @xmath30 be a variable symbol that may take on the value @xmath31 to mean `` upper '' or @xmath32 to mean `` lower '' .",
    "let @xmath33 be the event that the @xmath30 barrier is breached before the other barrier by time @xmath34 and let @xmath35 be the corresponding rebate paid at the expiry date of the option . if we denote the risk - free interest rate by @xmath36 by @xmath37 the probability operator , and by @xmath38 the risk neutral expectation operator , then the price @xmath24 of the double knock - out option is given by @xmath39\\ ] ]    in terms of the geometric brownian motion of the underlying , the probability that the stock price breaches a barrier before any given time @xmath16 is never zero .",
    "note that the operator @xmath38 is additive with respect to each term in its argument in . by the same properties of the geometric brownian motion , by choosing @xmath28 sufficiently far away from an initial barrier value @xmath40 we can make @xmath41 so small that if we let @xmath42 be the difference between the corresponding value of @xmath24 and the value of @xmath24 obtained by setting @xmath43 then @xmath44 this in terms of the accuracy of @xmath24 means that @xmath45 and thus the barrier @xmath46 has therefore no effect on the value of @xmath24 , and the double knock - out option degenerates into a simpler type of option , which may be a down - and - out barrier option if @xmath47 or an up - and - out barrier option if @xmath48 in the real world markets where all prices are determined only in terms of a finite number of precision digits , we may thus assume that the probability of a stock price breaching a barrier before a given time @xmath16 can take on the value zero for appropriately chosen values of the initial price @xmath28 .",
    "it is therefore meaningful to consider the following two complementary problems , for a given accuracy @xmath49 of option prices .",
    "problem 1 : :    find the minimum value @xmath50 of @xmath28 which    ensures that the stock price will not breach the lower curve before    time @xmath51 problem 2 : :    find the maximum value @xmath52 of @xmath28 which    ensures that the stock price will not breach the upper curve before    time @xmath51    we say a curve @xmath53 is worthless with respect to the stock price movement over a given time interval and for a given accuracy @xmath49 in stock prices if , with probability @xmath54 the path followed by @xmath3 will not breach the curve ( either from above or from below ) over that time interval .    in other words ,",

    "we shall also denote by @xmath100 and by @xmath101 the lower barrier and the upper barrier , respectively , and if any , for a given barrier option .",
    "we say that a barrier option of a given type is a typical barrier of that type if none of its barriers can be considered worthless for the corresponding parameter set .",
    "that is , if it can not be priced as a barrier option of a different type with the same parameter set .",
    "the equations and show that in addition to the parameters of the curved barriers , the critical values @xmath50 and @xmath52 of theorem  [ th : critic ] depend only on the drift and volatility parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the stock price @xmath25 and on the expiry time @xmath51 in a risk neutral world , we have @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the interest rate and @xmath104 is the continuous dividend yield , if any , paid by the underlying asset .",
    "however , the value of @xmath105 is of no importance for our analysis and we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath106 by the fixed parameter set for a given option , we shall therefore refer to the other parameters @xmath107 and @xmath36 as well as the initial asset price @xmath28 , the pay - off function parameters such the strike price @xmath108 and the curved barriers parameters .",

    "the option is a typical up - and - out barrier option if and only if + @xmath116    the proof also follows from the definition of @xmath117 and is similar to that of theorem  [ th : dao ] .",
    "the following result is also straightforward from the definitions of @xmath50 and @xmath52 given by theorem   [ th : critic ] .",

    "the option is a typical double barrier option if and only if @xmath122    it should be noted that the results of the theorems [ th : dao ] - [ th : db ] do not depend on the pay - off function of the options considered , and consequently they may be applied to all options endowed with barriers , and in particular they apply to both barrier call and barrier put options , european as well as american options , and options including a rebate payment .",
    "the importance of these theorems also stem from the fact that barriers can be added to virtually all sorts of existing options , and this is one of the reasons why barrier options have become so popular .",
    "an important particular case is that of constant barriers . in such case ,",
    "the lower and upper curves , if any , for a given option can be denoted by @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively , where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are constants , and we can therefore give more explicit expressions for the critical values @xmath50 and @xmath127 it is easy to see that the functions @xmath76 and @xmath93 given by the equations and have in this particular case a common expression for the turning point @xmath128 when it exists , given by @xmath129 consequently we have the following explicit expressions for the critical asset prices @xmath50 and @xmath127    [ eq : fcritic ] @xmath130    although to the best of our knowledge the critical value @xmath50 and @xmath52 are considered for curved barriers only for the first time in this paper , it should be noted that equations of the form have been used in @xcite for an optimal determination of the solution domain in the numerical pricing of barrier options with flat barriers .",
    "it s however , also the first time that these critical values are applied to the classification of barrier options .",
    "the choice of the value of @xmath69 in the equations and is clearly crucial . indeed ,",
    "these equations show that the larger @xmath69 is , the farther both @xmath50 and @xmath52 will be with respect to their corresponding barriers , and vice versa .",
    "this means that , as expected , larger values of @xmath69 yield critical values @xmath50 and @xmath52 which ensure with a better certainty that the barriers are worthless , but which are however not optimal .",
    "inversely , smaller values of @xmath69 will yield critical asset prices which are wrong by being too close to the barrier , and this is just a consequence of the fact that the equality @xmath131 is wrong for such values of @xmath69 . ideally , @xmath69 should be as indicated the smallest number for which the equality @xmath131 holds",
    ". however , for any numerical determination , the constant @xmath132 and consequently both @xmath50 and @xmath117 are very sensitive to the level of accuracy required in option prices .",
    "a numerical value for @xmath50 and @xmath52 can be found by trial and error on computing systems such as mathematica .",
    "for example in the case of a down - and - out barrier option , @xmath50 is the smallest value of the initial price @xmath28 for which the option price is the same as that of the vanilla option with the same parameters .",
    "we can then use such a numerical value to find the value of @xmath69 that yields the same value of @xmath50 given by theorem   [ th : critic ] .",
    "next , using this choice of @xmath132 and the same accuracy in option prices , we can check whether numerically computed critical asset prices match those given by theorem   [ th : critic ] , for different sets of parameters .    3.1 in c c c c c",

    "it also shows however that @xmath69 should be larger for larger volatilities .",
    "unfortunately , we do nt know how exactly the choice of @xmath69 changes with the volatility , and with other pricing parameters .",
    "nevertheless , theorem [ th : critic ] can be used efficiently when only approximate values of @xmath50 and @xmath52 are requested   @xcite . thanks to the non dimensional nature of the parameter",

    "in this paper , we ve found with very simple arguments in theorem   [ th : critic ] critical stock prices that determine when exactly a given stock price becomes worthless with respect to some given curves , and we ve given some applications of these critical values to barrier options .",
    "this simple determination gives fully explicit expressions for the critical stock prices @xmath50 and @xmath117 although it remains approximate due to the presence of the approximate parameter @xmath69 in these expressions .",
    "however , the explicit nature of this determination , as expressed for example in the particular case of flat barriers in , provide us with simple means to understand the properties of this critical asset prices . indeed , table   [ tb : test1 ] intuitively confirms all the effects of the expiry date @xmath16 and volatility @xmath8 on these critical stock prices .",
    "although the comparison in table [ tb : test1 ] between actual numerical values and corresponding semi - analytical values of the critical prices displays some discrepancies , such values can be safely and efficiently used in certain cases such as the optimal truncation of the solution domain in a numerical scheme , and especially in the case of the difficult problem of discrete barrier options pricing . indeed , in the case of constant barriers ,",
    "an application of the critical asset prices given by to the pricing of discrete barrier options has given in @xcite results closest to the only semi - analytical one available @xcite , when compared with similar results obtained with five other numerical methods .",
    "there are ways of finding exact numerical values for @xmath50 and @xmath127 for instance , the probability @xmath157 that the stock price will breach a given barrier before time @xmath34 given that it has value @xmath158 at time @xmath159 can be formulated as a first time exit problem , and it is well - known @xcite that @xmath157 satisfies the kolmogorov backward equation @xmath160 with @xmath161 and @xmath162 and with some boundary conditions that are easy to determine .",
    "for instance we have @xmath163 and @xmath164 on the boundary curves .",
    "the corresponding boundary value problem can be solved explicitly , at least by reducing eq .   to a simpler equation .",
    "but after all such lengthy calculations the corresponding expressions for @xmath50 and @xmath52 are not likely to be found explicitly , although their exact numerical values can be found in this way .",
    "equations of the form therefore have the advantage of providing in a much quicker and simpler manner , in terms of the non - dimensional parameter @xmath132 all the information needed for the properties of the critical values @xmath50 and @xmath127    by replacing the two curves in theorem [ th : critic ] by the straight line determined by the strike price @xmath29 of a given european option , theorem [ th : critic ] can also be used to determine the initial asset price range beyond which the option becomes worthless .",
