    "in 2006 , the very long baseline array ( vlba ) performed a large full polarisation survey of radio sources , the vlba imaging and polarimetry survey ( vips ; helmboldt et al .",
    "this survey was comprised of 198 hours of 5 ghz observations , targeting a subset of 1127 sources from the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; myers et al .",
    "2003 ) . while the primary goal of the survey was to identify and characterise potential",
    "_ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _",
    "sources @xcite , two concurrent objectives were to identify candidate members of two classes of rare astronomical objects , compact symmetric objects ( csos ) and supermassive binary black holes ( sbbhs ) .",
    "csos can broadly be described as dual - lobed sources whose extent is less than a kiloparsec and that are oriented close to the plane of the sky @xcite .",
    "similar to larger radio galaxies , the morphology we observe consists of relativistic jets emitted from opposing sides of the core , presumably where the central supermassive black hole resides .",
    "these jets then terminate at hotspots , where the fast moving jet material interacts with the surrounding media , intergalactic medium for large radio galaxies and interstellar medium for small csos , and inflate lobes .",
    "the emission of csos is typically dominated by these hot spots @xcite , typically leading to edge brightening .",
    "multi - epoch observations show the distance separating the furthest extents of the lobes typically increasing at @xmath00.1 c @xcite which , when extracted backwards to estimate the ages of these sources , implies that csos are young , ranging from @xmath1 years old @xcite",
    ". the small size and orientation of these sources make csos ideal for studying both galactic evolution and the properties of the media surrounding the agn . coupling this with the small number of heretofore confirmed csos , 50 - 90 @xcite justifies the further study of these objects .",
    "furthermore , the confirmed csos to date have mostly resulted from targeted observations aimed at a high rate of confirmation resulting in a lack of understanding in how these objects fit into our general understanding of agn , which a large sample of csos found within a uniform sample could provide .",
    "the combined theories of galactic growth via mergers and the residence of supermassive black holes in the centres of most galaxies necessitate supermassive black hole interactions if both are correct @xcite .",
    "binary black holes , which themselves end either in a merger event or ejection , are a naturally expected outcome of these interactions .",
    "the observed correlation between central supermassive black hole mass and the mass of the stellar bulge in galaxies further strengthens the expectation of binary systems . to date , the number of close separation ( @xmath2 pc ) sbbh candidates is small with only 0402 + 379 having morphological verification @xcite .",
    "one of the goals for this survey of over 1000 galaxies was to identify , and potentially confirm , new sbbh candidates .",
    "this paper explores the follow - up observations performed on sources identified as either cso or sbbh candidates .",
    "more detailed analysis , in particular on the individual sources comprising the vips cso sample , will be carried out in a subsequent paper . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume h@xmath3=73 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath5 = 0.27 , @xmath6 = 0.73 , unless noted otherwise .",
    "this paper makes use of ned wright s javascript cosmology calculator @xcite .",
    "the sample selection is described in detail in helmboldt et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . here",
    "we outline the vips classification process to better understand the followup sample being studied in this paper .    after imaging , an automated morphological classification",
    "was performed on all 1127 vips sources .",
    "this started with the aips @xcite task sad being used to generate multi - component gaussian models for each source .",
    "the sources were then categorised as follows :    * sources with a single gaussian component containing @xmath7 95% of the total flux density were flagged as single component sources * sources where the two brightest gaussian components contained @xmath7 95% of the total flux density were flagged as double sources * sources that did nt fit these criteria were flagged as multiple component sources    these preliminary categories were then refined as follows :    * single component sources with minor / major axis ratios of @xmath8 0.6 were classified as point sources ( pss ) , otherwise they were flagged as core - jets ( 0.6 was chosen since this was the axis ratio of the restoring beam used in the vips images ) * double sources where the flux densities of the two brightest components match within a factor of 2.5 were classified as cso candidates ( csos ) * multiple components sources where the components containing @xmath7 95% of the total flux density were located along a single line were flagged as core - jets , otherwise they were classified as complex ( cplx ) * core - jets longer than 6 mas were classified as long jets ( ljets ) , otherwise they were placed in the category of short jets ( sjets ) * ljets longer than 12 mas whose brightest gaussian component was positioned within 3 mas of the centre of the structure were reclassified as cso candidates ( csos )    the two separate ways sources could be classified as cso candidates were instituted since the the jets connecting the hotspots and lobes of csos back to the core are sometimes , but not always , detectable .",
    "the automatic source classifications were then verified visually and false classifications corrected ( 87% csos and 71% cplx sources were correct ) .",
    "this yielded 103 csos and 17 cplx sources needing follow - up observations .",
    "the list of sbbh candidates was generated by visually inspecting the 5 ghz images and looking for sources that appeared to have two distinct axes of emission , possibly indicating the existence of two separate bi - directional jet flows from two cores .",
    "the cplx sources were included in the follow - up both because they were a good place to look for sbbhs and since non - archetypical csos can easily be classified as such .",
    "two subsets of multi - frequency observations of the candidates were performed .",
    "a series of 4 separate observing runs from september 2006 to february 2007 ( bt088 ) and another 5 observing runs were performed from june 2007 to june 2008 ( bt094 ) all with the vlba .",
    "each of these observations consisted of four 8 mhz wide ifs in the c , x and u bands with full polarisation centred at : 4605.5 , 4675.5 , 4990.5 , 5091.5 , 8106.0 , 8176.0 , 8491.0 , 8590.0 , 14902.5 , 14910.5 , 15356.5 and 15364.5 mhz at an aggregate bit rate of 256 mbps to maximise ( @xmath9,@xmath10 ) coverage and sensitivity .",
    "when the data in each band were combined , the three central frequencies were : 4844.7 , 8344.7 , and 15137.5 mhz .",
    "the bt088 observations had typical times on source of @xmath038 minutes at c and x band and @xmath0116 minutes at u band . for bt094 typical time on source was @xmath010 minutes for c and x band and @xmath032 minutes for u band .",
    "the integrations for each source were spread out over approximately 10 hours to maximise ( @xmath9,@xmath10 ) coverage for the observations .",
    "most of the calibration and initial imaging of the data were carried out by automated aips and difmap @xcite scripts similar to those used in reducing the vips 5 ghz survey data @xcite .",
    "to summarise , flagging of bad data and calibration were performed using the vlba data calibration pipeline @xcite , while imaging was performed using difmap scripts described in @xcite .",
    "final images were inspected and manually improved using the difmap program to attain the best fidelity possible .",
    "part of the final imaging scripts for c and u bands involved running the difmap command selfcal on the data starting with the clean - component model of the x band data as the input model to help in aligning the source across all three frequencies .",
    "this creates a phase ` correction ' to shift the entire map in a way that maximises the alignment of the bright components across the map .",
    "this is the same method described in @xcite , where they align the maps for different frequencies for spectral index analysis .",
    "the four ifs for each observing band were treated separately in order to maximise ( @xmath9,@xmath10 ) coverage .",
    "the average root - mean - square scatter of the baseline visibility amplitudes in the calibrated data were @xmath1118 mjy , @xmath1116 mjy , and @xmath1114 mjy for the c , x , and u bands respectively for bt088 and @xmath1125 mjy , @xmath1123 mjy , and @xmath118 mjy for the c , x , and u bands respectively of bt094 .",
    "the bt094 15 ghz scatter is notably lower because we combined the four ifs after fringe fitting and calibration ( at the expense of ( @xmath9,@xmath10 ) coverage ) in order to compensate for the lower flux levels resulting from the steep spectrum of many of the sources . for the polarimetric analysis , the lower two and upper two if pairs in each band were combined and imaged to maximise the sensitivity while retaining some ` in band ' frequency information .",
    "polarisation calibration was carried out by first aligning the polarisation angles of all four ifs , within each band , to the pixel brightest in polarisation for 3c279 .",
    "then , the mean polarisation angles of j0854 + 2006 and j1310 + 3220 were compared to the values recorded in the _ _ vla / vlba polarisation calibration page _ _ applying any necessary interpolations in either time or frequency .",
    "typical errors in the electric vector polarisation angle ( evpa ) were 7@xmath12 , 8@xmath12 , and 13@xmath12 for the 5 , 8 , and 15 ghz maps respectively .",
    "this was determined using the deviation of the integrated evpa across all three evpa calibrators for each source .      for a subset of our candidates ( 11 sources ) which did nt have published redshifts ,",
    "spectroscopic observations were performed with the 9.2 m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) at mcdonald observatory to obtain spectral redshifts .",
    "the het observes in the declination range @xmath13 and is fully queue scheduled @xcite .",
    "we used the marcario low - resolution spectrograph ( lrs ; hill et al .",
    "1998 ) , with grism g1 ( @xmath14 lines mm@xmath4 ) , a 2  slit , and a schott gg385 long - pass filter for a resolution of r @xmath0 500 between 4150   and 10500  .",
    "typical exposures were 2 x 900 s with the slit placed along the parallactic angle .",
    "data reduction was performed with the iraf package @xcite using standard techniques .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed with a neon - argon lamp .",
    "we employed an optimal extraction algorithm @xcite to maximise the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "we performed spectrophotometric calibration using standard stars from @xcite .",
    "spectra were corrected for telluric absorptions and visually cleaned of cosmic rays .",
    "multiple exposures on a single target were combined into a single spectrum , weighted by s / n .",
    "the resulting spectra can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the 5 and 8 ghz , as well as the 8 and 15 ghz images were matched in resolution in order to obtain a spectral index distribution across the source , where we take @xmath15 .",
    "each spectral index map was overlaid onto 5 ghz contours to understand the distribution of spectral index within each source structure ( figures [ fig : cso_cxspix ] , [ fig : cso_xuspix ] , [ fig : cand_cxspix ] , [ fig : cand_xuspix ] , [ fig : refuted_cxspix ] and [ fig : refuted_xuspix ] ) .",
    "the spectral index maps for csos have been ` lettered ' to facilitate discussion and referencing of the images , for the remaining maps for candidates and refuted csos the source name will be sufficient . for consistency , this analysis was automated using scripts which did the following :    * the resolution of the images was matched by first adding a @xmath16 taper to the higher resolution maps until the beam was close ( within roughly 0.03 mas for 5 - 8 ghz spectral index and 0.25 mas for 8 - 15 ghz spectral index ) to the size of the lower frequency . * the beam size was then forced to match exactly using the difmap command restore , suppressing any residual large @xmath16 values from the higher frequency .",
    "the map dimensions were also matched , then spectral index maps were made using the aips task comb . *",
    "the caltech package program maplot was then used to overlay the spectral index maps onto the 5 ghz contours to identify where the spectral characteristics were located within the overall structure of each source .",
    "error maps associated with each spectral index map were produced using the root mean square error of the two input maps . in all these maps ,",
    "the pixels on the edge of each feature have a higher error than the centre of the features since the border features are not sampled by the full synthesised beam .",
    "the average error in @xmath17 for the maps , calculated by measuring the root mean square of the central features and the boundary of the components separately , are @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the 5 to 8 and 8 to 15 spectral index maps from bt088 and @xmath18 and @xmath20 for the 5 to 8 and 8 to 15 spectral index maps from bt094 respectively .",
    "this means that variation of that amplitude , particularly on size scales smaller than the beam width , should not be interpreted as realistic features on these maps .      comparing the summed flux densities of the csos at each frequency ( table [ tab : cso ] ) with the previously observed flux densities from surveys at single dish and shorter baseline interferometers ( i.e. vlss , wenss , nvss , gb6 ) we can test whether or not any emission is being missed by the vlba observations .",
    "sources could resolve out in these high resolution observations if emission is on larger scales that is visible to the single dish , but not to the vlba .",
    "in general the agreement is excellent ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) . when compared to the 5 ghz single - dish observations of @xcite ,",
    "half of the sources recover the total flux within the formal errors and 21 sources agree within an additional 15% .",
    "the few exceptions ( j09062 + 4636 , j12043 + 5202 , and j12201 + 2916 ) could be the result of variability since there is a 15 year separation between the observations .",
    "most of the csos exhibit a peak in these spectral energy distributions at @xmath01 ghz , as expected for lobe dominated emission on size scales of @xmath010 mas @xcite . a second turnover , such as that hinted at in the sed for j12201 + 2916 below 300 mhz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) , is indicative of larger - scale ( older ) emission not associated with the younger radio source shown in figures 2 & 3 .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that a few sources , notably j09062 + 4636 , j12545 + 1856 , j13113 + 1658 , and j16449 + 2536 , lack a clear peak .",
    "since fig.[fig : sed ] contains only confirmed csos , this illustrates the point that not all csos necessarily have a gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) though most ( 82% or 18 of 22 ) do .",
    "the gps peak tells us about the dominant component size , but does not directly confirm a cso nature or a young age for a given source .",
    "polarimetric analysis was performed on all of the confirmed vips csos , and polarised flux was observed in two of the sources .",
    "j07414 + 2706 exhibited polarised emission at both 5 and 8 ghz and j13262 + 395 was detected in polarisation at 8 and 15 ghz ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : j07414rm ] and [ fig : j13262rm ] ) .",
    "polarised emission from non - csos will be presented in a future work , with the notable exception of j16021 + 3326 , whose polarisation properties were investigated in the process of classifying it as a core - jet @xcite .",
    "historically , the definition of a cso has not been standardised and what one paper considers a requirement , another instead considers a common characteristic .",
    "we have adopted a broad definition for a cso , keeping the term an observation - based definition allowing that this classification might encompass multiple physically distinct species .",
    "even so , we suggest that the cso category is more focused and relevant classification than the purely spectral classification of gigahertz peaked spectrum and compact steep spectrum sources which are highly contaminated with blazars @xcite .",
    "we define a compact symmetric object as a source less than 1 kpc in projected extent , where two well defined hotspots ( the working surface where the jets push against the surrounding medium ) and/or lobes ( cavities filled with back flowing material ) are observed , which is the simplest and most encompassing definition we can devise . although the detection of a core is not strictly required , it does provide confirmation of the cso identification and aids in the understanding the underlying geometry of these systems .",
    "the hotspots in these sources are typically discernible as being steep gradients at the ends of the lobes , a characteristic referred to as edge brightening .",
    "several of the candidates in which counter jet / lobe emission was observed were still classified as non - csos ( j08170 + 1958 , j12035 + 4632 , j12582 + 5421 , j13128 + 5548 & j15159 + 2458 ) the x band detection of the counter emission of these sources was three sigma or less .",
    "we decided these were most likely core - jets oriented at a large enough angle out of the plane of the sky to just detect the de - boosted counter - emission .",
    "lower frequency vlbi observations could reveal them to have structure consistent with csos .      here",
    "each of the 24 confirmed vips cso will be briefly discussed .",
    "the properties of these csos are reported in table [ tab : cso ] and spectral index maps of each source are in figures [ fig : cso_cxspix ] & [ fig : cso_xuspix ] .",
    "a flat - spectrum compact core is visible in both figures [ fig : cso_cxspix]a and [ fig : cso_xuspix]a with lobes to the east and west .",
    "the western lobe is appreciably brighter than its counterpart due either to geometry or interaction with the surrounding media .",
    "polarisation is detected in the western lobe in both x and u bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig : j07414rm ] ) .",
    "this source has the highest flux density ratio for the two lobes ( 19.35 ) , indicating either one side of this source is strongly interacting with its environment or the jets might not be as close to the plane of the sky as is usually assumed in a cso .",
    "this source is @xmath0200pc across at its largest extant .",
    "this source is comprised of lobes extending to the northwest and southeast ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cso_cxspix]b ) . while the southern lobe shows flatting of its spectrum towards the centre of the system , there was nt enough evidence to identify a component to associate with the core of the system .",
    "the u band emission from this source was only marginally detected , and did nt allow the generation of an accurate 8 - 15ghz spectral index map .",
    "this source is also part of the csos observed in the northern sky ( coins ; peck & taylor 2000 ) project , where is was previously confirmed as a cso .",
    "this source was strongly detected at all three frequencies and is comprised of an unresolved core with weak extension to the north and south ( figs .",
    "[ fig : cso_cxspix]c and [ fig : cso_xuspix]c ) .",
    "we note the lack of edge brightening of the extended emission from this source that is typical of csos and is instead characterised with fri like morphology .",
    "weak polarisation was detected at 8ghz , but no rotation measures could be calculated .",
    "this source was confirmed as a cso by the compact radio sources at low redshift ( coralz ; ) project .",
    "the brightest feature of this source at 5 ghz appears to be a flat - spectrum core ( figs .",
    "[ fig : cso_cxspix]d and [ fig : cso_xuspix]d ) .",
    "the core ( @xmath21 to @xmath22 ) is edge brightened on its northeastern side .",

    "[ fig : cso_cxspix]e , there are small ( @xmath23 the beam width ) edge effects apparent ( positive stripe on the east and negative stripe on the west ) , which most likely arise from a slight misalignment of the two frequencies due to the complicate spectral nature of the north - eastern lobe .",

    "the core of this source is easily identified as the compact flat - spectrum component just east of the bright component in the centre of this source ( figs .",
    "[ fig : cso_cxspix]u and [ fig : cso_xuspix]u ) .",
    "symmetric s - shaped jets then emerge to the north and south , terminating in edge brightened hotspots separated by @xmath32pc ( table [ tab : cso ] ) .",
    "the compact flat - spectrum core of this source has lobes both to the east and west ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cso_cxspix]v ) .",
    "the western lobe is notably brighter and closer to the core either due to geometric effects or interaction with the local environment ( table [ tab : cso ] ) .",
    "the @xmath33 deviation from linearity for the three components is consistent with environmental interaction .",
    "we were unable to either confirm or refute 33 of the candidates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cand_cxspix ] & [ fig : cand_xuspix ] and table [ tab : noncsos ] ) .",
    "most of these sources , 16 out of 29 , were not detected at 15 ghz which contributed to the high number of persisting candidates .",
    "the refuted cso candidates are included for completeness in fig .",
    "[ fig : refuted_cxspix ] , [ fig : refuted_xuspix ] and table [ tab : notcsos ] but further analysis past invalidating them as cso candidates is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "the connection between the morphology and other properties of radio galaxies was first revealed when @xcite took a sub - sample of the 3cr catalogue @xcite and discovered a distinct luminosity cutoff ( @xmath34 w hz@xmath4 sr@xmath4 at 178 mhz with an assumed h@xmath3=50 km s@xmath4 ) separating diffuse sources whose highest flux was contained near the core ( so - called fr - i sources ) and edge - brightened sources that were most luminous where the jets terminated and ran into the surrounding medium ( fr - ii sources ) . while the canonical morphology of csos includes an edge - brightened lobe structure similar to what is observed in fr - ii radio galaxies , several of the csos in this sample exhibit the more - diffuse , ` wispy ' emission typically associated with the lower powered fr - i sources .",
    "interestingly , when we plot the 5 ghz luminosity of each source in fig .",
    "[ fig : size_lum ] an apparent separation of these morphologies by power is revealed ( @xmath35 w hz@xmath4 ) , just as for their much larger analogues . using fanaroff & riley s 178 mhz cutoff and",
    "ours yields a spectral index value , @xmath17 , of @xmath36 which is consistent with these lobe dominated sources . a more stringent evaluation of these subsets using a two sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test can not confirm these to be two independent populations , yielding p - value 0.059 , which is just above the 0.050 cutoff typically used to constrain significance .",
    "this is not surprising given that these populations would overlap in luminosity and we observed only four csos with distinct fr - i morphology .",
    "w hz@xmath4 , our imposed cut between fr - i and fr - ii morphology .",
    "a power law , with an index of 0.35 , was fit to these data and is plotted in cyan.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    overall , figure [ fig : size_lum ] also shows a strong relationship between the size of a source and its luminosity , with a spearman correlation coefficient of 0.88 and an associated p - value of @xmath37 .",
    "this could mean that the larger sources we observe are the more powerful ones that were able to expand further , or it could be due to them simply being older and having more time to fill their lobes with high - energy material . fitting a power law to these data gives the relationship to be @xmath38 . it has been proposed that unlike traditional radio galaxies the difference in brightness between the two lobes of a cso might be due more to interaction with the surrounding medium than simply orientation based boosting / deboosting .",
    "when observed in large radio galaxies , the brighter lobe is typically further away from the core due to the time of arrival difference caused by one lobe being physically closer to us than the other . to investigate this",
    ", we measured the arm lengths of each lobe , @xmath39 , using the distance from the core to the furthest model component in each lobe .",
    "we then plot the ratio of @xmath40 in figure [ fig : bright ] , which will be greater than one for sources following the previously described scenario . while some sources certainly exhibit the expected behaviour , with a maximum ratio of 3.26 , 7 of the 15 csos have hotspot length ratios less than unity , the smallest of which is 0.46 . while projection effects could create such a result , it is more than plausible that this behaviour is due to interactions of these small jets with local inhomogeneities in their environment .",
    "as mentioned in section [ polarisation ] , two of these csos have detections of polarised emission . in both of these sources we observed the polarised flux in the brighter lobe of the source .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite , where polarisation results for another two confirmed csos were reported , which also detected polarised emission only in the brighter lobe .",
    "they also found unusually high flux ratios ( 10 & 14 ) for the lobes of these csos , whereas only one of ours is high ( 19 and 1.6 in j07414 + 2706 and j13262 + 3154 respectively , while the median of the distribution is 1.79 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the agn unification scenario where the emission of most csos is depolarised as it passes through the dusty circumnuclear torus on its way to us , but for a few tilted csos ( where one of the lobes would appear significantly brighter ) the emission from the end of the near lobe does nt pass through the torus on its path towards us .",
    "the three if pairs that detected stronger polarisation in each source were used to compute rotation measures ( @xmath41s ) as a function of position ( figs .",
    "[ fig : j07414rm ] & [ fig : j13262rm ] ) wherever polarisation was detected at all three pairs by fitting the change in polarisation angle ( @xmath42 ) to @xmath43 , with values ranging from 1800 to 4000 and -300 to 500 rad m@xmath44 for j07414 + 2706 and j13262 + 3154 respectively .",
    "the @xmath41 is dependent on the magnetic field ( @xmath45 ) and the electron number density ( @xmath46 ) by : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the path length of the faraday screen , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the charge and mass of the electron and @xmath51 is the speed of light .",
    "these rotation measures were then used to calculate the magnetic field polarisation angle corrected for faraday rotation and are plotted on the right side of each figure . following the assumptions of @xcite and the references therein ( specifically @xcite ) , if we assume @xmath52 @xmath53 , and lower and upper limits for @xmath48 of 0.3 and 10 pc , we calculate magnetic fields of 0.21 to 16 and 0.04 to 2.7 @xmath54 for j07414 + 2706 and j13262 + 3154 respectively .    here , we point out the sign change in @xmath41 from one side of the polarised feature of j13262 + 3154 to the other , which could indicate a reversal of the magnetic field as seen in the above equation .",
    "however , since the polarised region is not well resolved ( less than 3 beams across ) , it does not satisfy the requirements for a @xmath41 gradient outlined in @xcite and therefore is not strong evidence for a magnetic field reversal in this source .",
    "despite theoretical expectations that csos might be isotropic @xmath55-ray emitters , presumably due to inverse compton scattering within the lobes of these compact sources ( e.g. @xcite ) none of our csos have been detected by telescopes such as the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope_. this is well matched with empirical results from other csos , with in fact only one candidate being detected by fermi to date .",
    "it is still possible these sources are emitting @xmath55-rays via conventional means and that these are being beamed in the direction of the jets .",
    "in fact , it is quite possible that some of the blazars detected by _",
    "fermi _ have a physical extent less than 1 kpc , but this information is impossible to disentangle .      using the number of confirmed csos as a lower limit and adding in the remaining candidates for an upper limit , we have 24 - 57 csos within the vips catalogue of 1127 sources ( 2.1%-5.1% ) . while the spectral and flux density prerequisites imposed on the vips sample limit what can be surmised about the fraction of csos within the entire population of radio - loud agn , this is the most complete sample to date to investigate the cso population . comparing this with other samples and supersets , @xcite report cso incidences of 11% , 4.4% and 2.1% for pr , pr+cj , and pr+cj+vcs , where pr , cj and vcs are pearson - readhead survey @xcite , the caltech - jodrell bank survey @xcite and the vlba calibrator survey @xcite respectively .",
    "direct comparison of these numbers is difficult since each sample had independent selection criteria and the follow - up analysis , particularly of the vcs , was not always rigorous .",
    "peck & taylor speculated that the cso fraction was inversely related to the limiting flux density of the survey , with pr having a cutoff of 1.3 jy at 5 ghz , compared to just 0.1 jy at 5 ghz for the vcs .",
    "the vips survey has a limiting flux density of 0.085 jy at 8 ghz @xcite , comparable to vcs , yet has a cso fraction closer to that of pr+cj .",
    "it seems likely that the vcs survey was deficient in csos due to its worse imaging characteristics .",
    "the high cso fraction in the pr survey can be explained as a fluke of small number statistics .",
    "the redshift distribution of vips csos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zdist ] ) shows a decay in incidence with redshift",
    ". this may be mostly due to selection effects , since although the emission from csos is bright it is by definition not strongly beamed towards us and therefore not doppler boosted .",
    "when compared to the redshift distribution of _ fermi _ detected flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl - lacertae objects ( bl - lacs ) , which seem to be representative samples of those types of sources , we see that the vips csos and _ fermi _ fsrqs almost certainly come from independent populations with a two sample k - s test p - value of @xmath56 .",
    "it is important to point out that this could either be due to selection effects or inherent characteristics of the populations .",
    "the same can not be said for csos and bl - lacs , with a k - s test p - value of 0.49 , meaning we can not rule out the possibility these are from a similar population distribution .    )",
    "distribution of the csos with reliable redshift data are plotted along with the distribution of redshifts for frsqs and bl - lac object is plotted for comparison . while the csos and fsrqs are clearly different distributions , possibly due to selection effects , the same can not be said for csos and bl - lacs.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]      these multi - frequency follow - up observations were additionally searched for either :    * two distinct flat- or inverted - spectrum compact cores * jet structure that can not be easily traced back to a single point of origin    we were unable to confirm any new sbbhs with these follow - up observations , and none of the 15 remaining candidates are particularly promising ( see figures [ fig : cso_cxspix]-[fig : refuted_xuspix ] ) . making the assumption that no sbbhs were observed in vips , then from the combined vips and caltech - jodrell bank flat - spectrum ( cjf ) sample together only one sbbh ( 0402 + 379 ; rodriguez et al .",
    "2006 ) has been detected out of 1279 sources . reconciling this within the current merger driven paradigm of galaxy evolution",
    "minimally requires that our understanding of black hole merger times , particularly the so - called ` final parsec problem ' of the merger stalling for small radii @xcite , be re - evaluated .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite result of finding only a single sbbh within a sample of 3114 agn with vlbi observations , which was also 0402 + 379 .",
    "the detailed analysis within that paper of the 1575 sources with redshift data suggest that black hole binaries do not stall indefinitely at any radius @xmath23 500 parsecs unless the most pessimistic estimates of merger rates hold true .",
    "we have identified 24 csos within the vips sample using the spectral and morphological characteristics of each source , 15 of which were previously unclassified , and are still left with a remaining 33 cso candidates ( @xmath57 of vips ) .",
    "subsequent 15 ghz observations using higher bandwidth ( @xmath58 2 ghz ) should confirm or deny at least half of the remaining candidates .",
    "our sample of csos is large enough to observe an fr - i / fr - ii distinction in both luminosity and morphology , similar to larger radio galaxies , which has not been previously identified .",
    "correlation is observed within these data between the size and luminosity of csos , which could result either from pile - up of emitting material if the larger sources are also older or could indicate the ability of more powerful sources to expand more efficiently within their environments .",
    "further evidence of the significance of environmental interaction with cso jets is given by @xmath59 of the csos having arm length ratios of the bright lobe divided by the dim lobe less than unity .",
    "polarisation was detected in two of these csos , doubling the number of known polarised csos .",
    "in all four of these cases , polarisation was only detected in the brighter lobe / jet and it was usually ( @xmath60 ) detected near the working surface of the jet .",
    "this , coupled with @xmath60 of the sources having unusually high luminosity ratios for the lobes ( @xmath61 ) is consistent with most of the inherently polarised emission from csos being depolarised by the dusty molecular torus surrounding the nucleus , and only the sources that are oriented out of the plane of the sky enough to attain a line of sight to the end of the jets that does nt pass through the torus being observed to be polarised .",
    "our lack of new supermassive binary black hole detections is consistent with other comparable work , and indicates either that the ` final parsec ' problem does nt exist or that the more pessimistic projections of merger event rates could be correct .",
