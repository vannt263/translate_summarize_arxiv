    "[ eq1 ] can be rewritten as a system of @xmath26 linear equations with @xmath25 variables : @xmath47 where now @xmath48 is a @xmath49 matrix of real numbers , and @xmath50 .",
    "notice that the linear system in eq .",
    "[ eq : sistema ] has solutions since the rank of @xmath48 is @xmath51 ( all the equations are separated and each of the variables , @xmath46 , appears in one equation only ) , and the in - degree of all nodes is positive by definition .",
    "hence , there always exists @xmath52 such that eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] is satisfied .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq : sistema ] in a form that emphasises the dependence of matrix @xmath48 from @xmath53 .",
    "we choose to label the arcs as follows : @xmath54 , @xmath55 denotes the @xmath56-th arc entering node @xmath11 , where @xmath57 is the in  degree of node @xmath11 .",
    "likewise , @xmath58 is the source of arc @xmath54 , while @xmath59 is the corresponding weight . using this notation , the @xmath11-th component of eq .",
    "[ eq : sistema ] can be written as : @xmath60 by direct computation , one positive solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : eq2 ] is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 , and by continuity there are infinite many solutions such that @xmath59 are all positive . in particular , if for node @xmath11 we have @xmath63 , then the @xmath11-th equation of eq .",
    "[ eq : eq2 ] has a unique solution , while if @xmath64 , there are always infinitely many solutions depending on @xmath65 parameters . summing up , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sistema ] ) has only one solution if all the node in - degrees are equal to one , while there are , in general , infinitely many solutions depending on @xmath66 parameters .",
    "notice that @xmath67 can be different from @xmath9 , meaning that it is also possible to set the value of the largest eigenvalue of the weighted graph .      here",
    ", we show that it is not necessary to fix the weights of all the graph links in order to get an arbitrary centrality vector @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , given a subset of links @xmath68 containing at least one incoming link for each node , it is sufficient to assign some positive weights @xmath69 to each @xmath70 , while keeping @xmath71 constant @xmath72 , for instance all equal to @xmath24 , such that the resulting weighted graph has eigenvector centrality equal to @xmath16 . without loss of generality we can assume that the first @xmath73 incoming links of each node @xmath11 belong to @xmath30 , so that the components of eq .",
    "[ eq : eq2 ] can be written as :      therefore , since @xmath75 for each @xmath76 , then there is a @xmath77 such that for every @xmath78 @xmath79 and hence , by a similar continuity argument as above , we can ensure that there are infinitely many positive solutions to eq.[eq : eq3 ] .",
    "a _ controlling set _ of graph @xmath7 is any set of nodes @xmath80 such that : @xmath81 this means that , for each node @xmath31 in the graph , at least one of the two following conditions holds : _ a _ ) @xmath82 , or _",
    "@xmath31 is pointed by at least one node in @xmath83 .",
    "we use @xmath84 to denote the size of the controlling set , i.e. the number of nodes contained in @xmath83 . finding the _ minimum controlling set",
    "_ @xmath85 of a graph @xmath7 , i.e. a controlling set having minimal size , is equivalent to computing the so - called _ domination number _ of @xmath7 .",
    "the domination number problem is a well known np - hard problem in graph theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , the size of the minimum controlling set can be determined exactly only for small @xmath26 graphs as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : real_social ] . to investigate larger graphs",
    "we have used two greedy algorithms .",
    "the first algorithm , called top  down controller search ( tdcs ) , works as follows .",
    "we initially set @xmath86 .",
    "we select the node @xmath87 with the maximum out - degree in @xmath88 , and mark it as _ controller node_. then , all the nodes in the out - neighbourhood of @xmath87 are marked as _ controlled _ and are removed from @xmath88 , together with @xmath87 itself . in this way , we obtain a new graph @xmath89 , and we store the controller node @xmath87 , together with the list of nodes controlled by @xmath87 . notice that , removing a generic node @xmath31 from @xmath88 , also implies that @xmath89 does not contain any of the links pointing to @xmath31 or originating from it .",
    "the same procedure is iteratively applied to @xmath89 , @xmath90 and so on , until all the nodes of @xmath7 are either marked as controller or as controlled nodes .",
    "the algorithm produces a set @xmath91 , with @xmath92 , which is a controlling set of @xmath7 by construction .",
    "the second algorithm is called bottom  up controller search ( bucs ) , and it works as follows .",
    "we set @xmath86 and consider the set @xmath93 containing all the nodes in @xmath88 with minimum in  degree . for each node @xmath94",
    ", we consider the set of nodes pointing to @xmath11 and select from this set the node @xmath95 with the maximal out  degree .",
    "this node is marked as _",
    "controller_. then we obtain a new graph @xmath89 by removing from @xmath88 all the controller nodes @xmath95 for all @xmath94 , together with all the nodes , marked as _ controlled _ , pointed by them .",
    "the same procedure is iteratively applied to @xmath89 , @xmath90 and so on , until all the nodes of @xmath7 are either marked as controller or as controlled nodes .",
    "if a graph @xmath96 contains isolated nodes , these are marked as _ controller _ and removed from @xmath96 .",
    "the algorithm finally produces a set @xmath91 which is a controlling set of @xmath7 by construction .",
    "we have verified that the controlling sets obtained by both tdcs and bucs for each of the networks considered are much smaller than those obtained by randomly selecting the controlling nodes . moreover , the set of controller nodes found by tdcs is in general different from that obtained on the same network by bucs .",
    "also the sizes of the two controlling sets obtained by the two algorithms are different .",
    "in particular , we have noticed that in assortative ( disassortative ) networks the controlling set produced by tdcs is smaller ( larger ) than that produced by bucs .",

    "<S> spectral centrality measures allow to identify influential individuals in social groups , to rank web pages by their popularity , and even to determine the impact of scientific researches . </S>",
    "<S> the centrality score of a node within a network crucially depends on the entire pattern of connections , so that the usual approach is to compute the node centralities once the network structure is assigned . </S>",
    "<S> we face here with the inverse problem , that is , we study how to modify the centrality scores of the nodes by acting on the structure of a given network . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that there exist particular subsets of nodes , called controlling sets , which can assign any prescribed set of centrality values to all the nodes of a graph , by cooperatively tuning the weights of their out - going links . </S>",
    "<S> we show that many large networks from the real world have surprisingly small controlling sets , containing even less than @xmath0 of the nodes . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that rankings obtained from spectral centrality measures have to be considered with extreme care , since they can be easily controlled and even manipulated by a small group of nodes acting in a coordinate way .    </S>",
    "<S> modelling social , biological and information - technology systems as complex networks has proven to be a successful approach to understand their function @xcite . among the various aspects of networks which have been investigated so far , the issue of _ centrality _ , and the related problem of identifying the central elements in a network , has remained pivotal since its first introduction . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of centrality was initially proposed in the context of social systems , where it was assumed a relation between the location of an individual in the network and its influence and power in group processes @xcite . since then , various _ </S>",
    "<S> centrality measures _ have been introduced over the years to rank the nodes of a graph according to their topological importance . </S>",
    "<S> centrality has found many applications in social systems @xcite , in biology @xcite and in man - made spatial networks @xcite .    among the various measures of centrality , such as those based on counting the first neighbours of a node ( degree centrality ) , or the number of shortest paths passing through a node ( betweenness centrality )  @xcite , a particularly important class of measures are those based on the spectral properties of the graph @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spectral centrality measures include the _ eigenvector centrality _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the _ alpha centrality _ @xcite , _ katz s centrality _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and _ pagerank _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and are often associated to simple dynamics taking place over the network , such as various kinds of random walks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as representative of the class of spectral centralities , we focus here on eigenvector centrality , which is based on the idea that the importance of a node is recursively related to the importance of the nodes pointing to it . given an unweighted directed graph @xmath1 with @xmath2 nodes and @xmath3 links , described by the @xmath4 adjacency matrix @xmath5 , the eigenvector centrality @xmath6 of @xmath7 is defined as the eigenvector of @xmath8 associated to the largest eigenvalue @xmath9 , which in formula reads @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the graph is strongly connected , then the perron - frobenius theorem guarantees that @xmath6 is unique and positive . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath6 can be normalised such that the sum of the components equals 1 , and the value of the @xmath11-th component represents the centrality score of node @xmath11 , i.e. the fraction of the total centrality associated to node @xmath11 . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we show how to change the eigenvector centrality scores of all the nodes of a graph by performing only local changes at node level . as a first step ( see the methods section ) we have proved that , given any arbitrary positive vector @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , it is _ always _ possible to assign _ the weights of all the links _ of a strongly  connected graph @xmath7 and to construct a new weighted network @xmath15 , with the same topology as @xmath7 and with eigenvector centrality equal to @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the weighted adjacency matrix of @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : smallgraph ] for a graph with @xmath19 nodes and @xmath20 links . in the original unweighted graph @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> node @xmath21 is the node with the highest eigenvector centrality , followed in order by node @xmath22 , node @xmath23 , and node @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> now , if we have the possibility of tuning the weights of each of the five links , we can set any centrality value to the nodes of the graph . in figure </S>",
    "<S> we show , for instance , how to fix the weights of the five links in order to construct : _ </S>",
    "<S> i ) _ a weighted network @xmath15 in which all nodes have the same centrality score , and _ </S>",
    "<S> ii ) _ even a weighted network @xmath15 in which the centrality ranking is totally reversed with respect to the ranking in @xmath7 .         as shown in the example , given a graph @xmath7 , by controlling the weights of all the links , it is always possible to set any arbitrary vector @xmath16 as the eigenvector centrality of the graph . </S>",
    "<S> however , tuning the weights of all the @xmath25 links of a given network is practically unfeasible , especially in large systems . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , this is not necessary , either . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in the case of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : smallgraph ] , a weighted graph with all nodes having the same centrality score can also be obtained by changing the weights of only four links , while leaving unchanged the weight of the link from node 1 to node 2 . </S>",
    "<S> more in general , it can be proved that the eigenvector centrality of the whole network can be controlled by appropriately tuning the weights of just @xmath26 of the @xmath25 links . </S>",
    "<S> the only constraint is that the @xmath26 links must belong to a subset @xmath27 such that , for every node @xmath28 , there is a link @xmath29 _ pointing  to _  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 ( see methods section ) .        </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : real_social ] for three real social networks . in each of the three cases , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to set any arbitrary eigenvector centrality by changing only the weights of the red arcs , while keeping unchanged ( and equal to @xmath24 ) the weights of all remaining arcs , shown in yellow . the nodes from which the links in @xmath30 originate are also coloured in red , and are referred to as a _ controlling set _ of the network ( see methods section ) . </S>",
    "<S> what is striking is that , in each of the three networks , the set @xmath30 can be chosen in such a way that all the links in @xmath30 originate from a relatively small subset of nodes . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the controlling set reported for the student government network of the university of ljubljana contains only two nodes . </S>",
    "<S> this is also a _ minimum controlling set _ , since the graph does not admit another controlling set with a smaller number of nodes . </S>",
    "<S> this finding indicates that only two members of the student government , namely node 2 and node 8 , can in principle set the centrality of all the other members by concurrently modifying the weights of some of their links . </S>",
    "<S> it is in fact reasonable to assume that the weight of the directed link from @xmath11 to @xmath31 , representing in this case the social credit ( in terms of reputation , esteem or leadership acknowledgement ) given by individual @xmath11 to individual @xmath31 , can be strengthen or decreased _ only _ by @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , nodes 2 and 8 can modify at their will the weights of their out - going links and , if these changes are opportunely coordinated , they can largely alter the actual roles of all the other individuals . </S>",
    "<S> analogously , only five monks can control the centrality of the sampson s monk network , while only 4 members of the zachary s karate club network can set the eigenvector centrality of the remaining 30 members .    </S>",
    "<S> a question of practical interest is to investigate the size @xmath32 of the minimum controlling set in various complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath33 is small with respect to @xmath26 , then the centrality of the network is easy to control . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , when the number of nodes in the minimum controlling set is large , the network @xmath7 is more robust with respect to centrality manipulations . </S>",
    "<S> we have used two greedy algorithms to compute approximations of minimum controlling sets in various real systems ( see methods section ) . in table  </S>",
    "<S> [ table ] we report the best approximation for @xmath33 , i.e. the size of the smallest controlling set @xmath34 produced by either of the two algorithms in networks whose sizes range from hundreds to millions of nodes . in the majority of the cases we have found unexpectedly small controlling sets , containing only up to @xmath35 of the nodes of the network . for instance , in the graph of jazz musicians , there exists a controlling set made by just @xmath36 of the @xmath37 musicians . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath36 individuals alone can , in principle , decide to set the popularity of all the other musicians , enhancing the centrality of some of the nodes and decreasing the centrality of others , just by playing more or less often with some of their first neighbours . among all the networks we have considered </S>",
    "<S> , the one with the smallest controlling set is the wikipedia talk communication network , a graph with 2,394,385 nodes in which just @xmath38 of nodes are able to alter the centrality of the entire system . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities in parenthesis indicate that for this network a set of just @xmath39 of the nodes can control the centrality of @xmath40 of the nodes .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for each real network @xmath7 , we have also computed the typical size @xmath41 of the minimum controlling set in its randomised counterpart ( see the rightmost column in table  [ table ] ) . in particular , we have considered a randomisation which preserves the degree sequence of the original graph . in </S>",
    "<S> most of the cases @xmath42 , relevant exceptions being some spatial man - made networks , such as power grids , road networks and electronic circuits , and also the patents citation network . </S>",
    "<S> this fact suggests that , in the absence of other limitations , such as strong spatial / geographic constraints  @xcite , the structure of real networks has naturally evolved to favour the control of spectral centrality by a small group of nodes . to better compare the controllability of networks with different sizes </S>",
    "<S> , we report in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : crand ] the ratio @xmath43 as a function of the number of graph nodes @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the smallest values of the ratio @xmath43 are found for collaboration / communication systems , www and socio - economical networks . </S>",
    "<S> the five most controllable networks are respectively wiki - talk , internet at the as level , movie actors , the stanford world wide web , and the collaboration network of researchers in astrophysics . </S>",
    "<S> these are all networks in which single nodes can tune , at their will , the weights of their out - going links </S>",
    "<S> . a scientist can decide whether to weaken or strengthen the connections to some of the collaborators . </S>",
    "<S> the administrators of an internet autonomous system can control the routing of traffic through neighbouring ass , by modifying peering agreements @xcite . and , </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the owner of a web page can change the weights of hyperlinks , for instance by assigning them different sizes , colour , shapes and positions in the web page .    , the ratio between the sizes of the minimum controlling set in real networks and in their respective randomized versions ( we have considered averages over 100 different realizations ) . </S>",
    "<S> different symbols and colors refer to the six network classes considered in table  [ table ] . </S>",
    "<S> the observed ratio is lower than 1 in most of the cases , with the smallest values corresponding to collaboration / communication systems , www and socio - economical networks . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio is equal to 1 in three cases . </S>",
    "<S> the networks with ratio larger than 1 , with the exception of one socio - economical system ( namely epinions ) , are all spatially constrained systems : three electronic circuits , the us power grid , and three road networks . ]    in this work , we have shown how a small number of entities , working cooperatively , can set any arbitrary eigenvector centrality for all the nodes of a real complex network . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to extend our results to other spectral centralities , such as @xmath44-centrality and katz s centrality . </S>",
    "<S> similar arguments can also be applied , with some limitations , to pagerank : in this case , the inverse centrality problem has solutions only for some particular choices of @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> such findings suggest that rankings obtained from centrality measures should be taken into account with extreme care , since they can be easily controlled and even distorted by a small group of cooperating nodes . </S>",
    "<S> the high controllability of real networks potentially has large social and commercial impact , given that centrality measures are nowadays extensively used to identify key actors , to rank web pages , and also to assess the value of a scientific research . </S>"
