    "it has been shown that the nonlinear resonance effects ( such as trapping , reflection ) can be significant along with the linear resonance of landau damping .",
    "though , there have been a number of similar works in recent times ( see , e.g. , refs . ) , however , the theory of landau damping on nonlinear ion - acoustic waves ( iaws ) is still undeveloped in the semiclassical or full quantum regimes .",

    "<S> we study the nonlinear propagation of ion - acoustic waves ( iaws ) in an unmagnetized collisionless plasma with the effects of electron and ion landau damping in the weak quantum ( semiclassical ) regime , i.e. , when the typical ion - acoustic ( ia ) length scale is larger than the thermal de broglie wavelength . starting from a set of classical and semiclassical vlasov equations for ions and electrons , coupled to the poisson equation </S>",
    "<S> , we derive a modified ( by the particle dispersion ) korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation which governs the evolution of iaws with the effects of wave - particle resonance . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that in contrast to the classical results , the nonlinear iaw speed @xmath0 and the linear landau damping rate @xmath1 are no longer constants , but can vary with the wave number @xmath2 due to the quantum particle dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the quantum parameter @xmath3 ( the ratio of the plasmon energy to the thermal energy densities ) and the electron to ion temperature ratio @xmath4 on the profiles of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and the solitary wave amplitude are also studied . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the decay rate of the wave amplitude can be reduced by in creasing the values of @xmath3 and @xmath7 . </S>"
