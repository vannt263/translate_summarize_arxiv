    "space - time coding for multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) systems has seen a lot of progress in the last decade . starting from orthogonal designs @xcite and quasi orthogonal designs @xcite , several space - time block code ( stbc ) constructions",
    "have been proposed in the literature including the recently proposed space - time block codes from division algebras @xcite , crossed product algebras @xcite , co - ordinate interleaved orthogonal designs @xcite and clifford algebras @xcite .",
    "several aspects of space - time block codes ( stbcs ) have been studied in the literature . in the high snr regime , two main aspects which dictate the error performance are diversity gain and coding gain .",
    "of these two aspects , diversity gain has been well studied and presently many high rate , full diversity stbc constructions are available in the literature .",
    "an important class of such codes is the ones from division algebras @xcite .",
    "coding gain has remained an open problem not only for mimo channels but also for single input single output channels and the awgn channel . later",
    "few more aspects such as the information lossless property @xcite and the diversity - multiplexing gain tradeoff @xcite were introduced .",
    "explicit stbcs satisfying these additional requirements were also obtained from division algebras @xcite . however , there are still other important issues that need to be addressed .",
    "one such important issue is the maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding complexity of stbcs .",
    "the lattice decoder or sphere decoder @xcite is known to be an efficient ml decoder . however , the complexity of a sphere decoder @xcite is also prohibitively large for high rate stbcs such as those from division algebras .",
    "for example , decoding a @xmath1 stbc from cyclic division algebras is equivalent to decoding a @xmath2 dimensional real lattice and performing a simulation to obtain an error performance curve can easily take several weeks .",
    "thus it is not practically feasible to implement ml decoding for the ` good ' performing codes in the literature .",
    "it is well known @xcite that stbcs obtained from orthogonal designs ( ods ) using qam constellation admit single real symbol decoding and give full diversity .",
    "but for @xmath3 tx antennas , an od which provides a transmission rate of @xmath4 complex symbol per channel use does not exist @xcite . however , it was shown in @xcite that a single complex symbol decodable ( @xmath0 real symbol decodable ) full diversity stbc for @xmath3 transmit antennas can be constructed . later in @xcite , the general framework of multi - symbol decodable or multi - group decodable stbcs was introduced to improve the transmission rate .",
    "multi - symbol or multi - group decodable stbcs admit ml decoding to be done separately for groups of symbols rather than all the symbols together thus reducing the ml decoding complexity .",
    "the class of stbcs from ods correspond to the case of one real symbol per group .",
    "thus it is clear that there is a tradeoff involving rate , ml decoding complexity and number of transmit antennas for full diversity stbcs . in the first part of this paper , measures of rate and ml decoding complexity",
    "are given and the problem of optimally trading off rate for ml decoding complexity within the framework of multi - group decodable stbcs is formally posed . a partial solution to this general problem is provided by characterizing this tradeoff for a certain specific class of stbcs called as clifford unitary weight ( cuw ) stbcs @xcite . an algebraic framework based on extended clifford algebras",
    "is introduced to study cuw stbcs .",
    "this framework is used to obtain the optimal rate - ml decoding complexity tradeoff and also to construct cuw stbcs meeting this tradeoff optimally . recently in @xcite , a @xmath5 high rate , information lossless stbc with low ml decoding complexity and non - vanishing determinants has been discussed .",
    "this @xmath5 stbc is not a multi - group decodable stbc and such stbcs are not considered in this paper .",
    "the second part of the paper focuses on constructing distributed space - time block codes ( dstbcs ) with low ml decoding complexity for the jing - hassibi protocol @xcite .",
    "distributed space - time coding @xcite is a coding technique for exploiting cooperative diversity in wireless relay networks wherein each relay is made to transmit a column of a space - time code thereby imitating a multiple antenna system .",
    "there are mainly two types of processing at the relay nodes that are widely discussed in the literature : ( 1 ) amplify and forward and ( 2 ) decode and forward . throughout this paper , we focus only on amplify and forward based protocols for three reasons : ( 1 ) relay nodes are not required to decode and re - encode , ( 2 ) relay nodes do not require the channel knowledge for processing ( this feature can permit a possible extension of the protocol to a completely non - coherent strategy ) and ( 3 ) simpler processing at the relay nodes . in @xcite , jing and hassibi have proposed an amplify and forward based two phase transmission protocol for achieving cooperative diversity in wireless relay networks .",
    "this protocol essentially employs stbcs satisfying certain additional conditions to take care of the distributed nature .",
    "we call such codes satisfying certain additional conditions as dstbcs to distinguish them from collocated stbcs .",
    "analogous to the case of collocated stbcs , for large number of relays , the ml decoding complexity of dstbcs becomes too prohibitive at the destination and thus is an important issue that needs to be addressed .",
    "most of the previous works on dstbcs @xcite fail to address this issue . in @xcite , full diversity ,",
    "two - group ml decodable dstbcs were constructed using division algebras . in @xcite ,",
    "quasi - orthogonal stbcs were proposed for use as dstbcs for the specific case of @xmath3 relays . in the second part of this paper , using the algebraic framework of extended clifford algebras introduced in the first part , three new classes of four - group decodable full diversity dstbcs for any number of relays are constructed .",
    "the jing - hassibi protocol assumes that there is perfect symbol synchronization amongst the relay nodes and that the signals transmitted from the relays arrive at the same time at the destination . but achieving symbol synchronization among the geographically distributed relay nodes is a challenging and difficult task in practice .",
    "several works in the literature @xcite have recognized this as a major bottleneck and have proposed many coding and transmission techniques to mitigate the effects of symbol asynchronism .",
    "most of the works based on amplify and forward propose methods to achieve full cooperative diversity in asynchronous wireless relay networks , but however fail to address the ml decoding complexity issues . in @xcite , a ofdm based alamouti transmission scheme is proposed to combat the effects of symbol asynchronism .",
    "the li - xia transmission scheme is particularly interesting because of its associated simplicity and low decoding complexity . in this scheme",
    ", ofdm is implemented at the source node and time reversal / conjugation is performed at the relay nodes on the received ofdm symbols from the source node .",
    "the received signals at the destination after ofdm demodulation are shown to have the alamouti stbc structure and hence single symbol maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding can be performed .",
    "however , the alamouti code is applicable only for the case of two relay nodes and for larger number of relays , the authors of @xcite propose to cluster the relay nodes and employ alamouti code in each cluster .",
    "but this clustering technique provides diversity order of only two and fails to exploit the diversity available in the network .",
    "motivated by the results of @xcite , in the third part of this paper it is shown that the dstbcs proposed in this paper can be used along with ofdm to achieve full asynchronous cooperative diversity for any number of relays along with low ml decoding complexity .",
    "finally it is shown how differential encoding at the source node can be combined with the proposed ofdm based transmission scheme to arrive at a new transmission scheme that provides full cooperative diversity in asynchronous relay networks with no channel information and also no timing error knowledge at any of the nodes .    the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows :    * a new measure of rate of an stbc is defined and the problem of optimal tradeoff between rate and ml decoding complexity within the framework of multi - group ml decodable stbcs is posed . an algebraic framework based on extended clifford algebras is introduced for studying cuw stbcs . using this algebraic framework and tools from representation theory of groups ,",
    "the optimal tradeoff between rate and ml decoding complexity of cuw stbcs is characterized for certain specific cases .",
    "* constructions of cuw stbcs meeting this optimal tradeoff for the specific cases are also provided .",
    "the abba construction first proposed in @xcite is shown to be a certain specific matrix representation of extended clifford algebras and hence they fall under the class of cuw stbcs .",
    "the contributions on multi - group ml decodable collocated stbcs are described in section [ sec2 ] . *",
    "the jing - hassibi protocol @xcite is generalized to allow non - unitary matrices at the relays .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions needed for dstbcs to be multi - group ml decodable are identified and three new classes of four group ml decodable dstbcs which achieve full cooperative diversity for any number of relays are also provided . to the knowledge of the authors ,",
    "these are the first known dstbcs that achieve the least possible ml decoding complexity compared to all other dstbc constructions , having the same transmission rate in complex symbols per channel use in the literature .",
    "this contribution is detailed in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "* the ofdm based alamouti transmission scheme for @xmath0 relays in @xcite is extended to a more general transmission scheme that can achieve full asynchronous cooperative diversity for any number of relays .",
    "sufficient conditions for a dstbc to be compatible with the requirements of this ofdm based transmission scheme are provided and the four - group decodable dstbcs in this paper are shown to satisfy these sufficient conditions .",
    "* it is shown how differential encoding at the source node can be combined with the proposed ofdm based transmission scheme to arrive at a new transmission scheme that provides full cooperative diversity in asynchronous relay networks with no channel information and also no timing error knowledge at any of the nodes .",

    "then the rate of transmission in bits per channel use ( bpcu ) of a stbc as in definition [ defn_stbc ] is given by @xmath40 bpcu .",

    "this measure is also indicative of the coding gain of the stbc and several examples of stbcs in the literature are discussed to illustrate the significance of the new measure of rate introduced in this paper .",
    "note that the set of all @xmath36 complex matrices is a vector space over the field of real numbers @xmath41 and has a dimension of @xmath42 over @xmath41 .",

    "the notion of linear independence of weight matrices of a lstd over @xmath41 has not been stressed or mentioned explicitly in most previous works though it has been implicitly assumed .",
    "notice that specifies a way to describe stbcs using linear space - time designs ( lstds ) and also explicitly provides a method to encode stbcs . from an encoding perspective",
    ", the real variables can be thought of as modulating the matrices @xmath55 .",
    "hence we call the matrices @xmath55 as basis matrices or modulation matrices or weight matrices .",
    "the vector of real variables @xmath56 takes values from @xmath51 .",
    "we call @xmath57 as the signal set . the connection between stbcs and lstds is pictorially depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_stbc_lstd ] .    note that for a given stbc @xmath34 the set of basis matrices @xmath55 along with the associated signal set @xmath57 is not unique , i.e. , there may exist another set of basis matrices with some other associated signal set that results in the same stbc @xmath34 .",
    "note also that it is not necessary that the basis matrices have to be codewords .",
    "we shall see in the sequel that the choice of basis matrices and signal set controls the encoding as well as decoding complexity .",
    "however , it is important to note that @xmath44 is unique to the stbc @xmath34 .    thus a stbc can be thought of as a subset of a subspace of dimension @xmath44 . thus designing a stbc",
    "can be done in two steps : first choose a subspace of dimension @xmath44 ( choose a lstd ) and then choose a subset of required cardinality ( choose the signal set @xmath57 ) within the chosen subspace .",
    "+ in this paper , we use the following definition of rate of a stbc .",
    "[ defn_rate ] rate of a stbc @xmath58 dimensions per channel use .",
    "note that the unit of rate of a stbc according to definition [ defn_rate ] is dimensions per channel use ( dpcu ) .",
    "since there are @xmath44 real variables which modulate @xmath44 modulation matrices , we can view it as though we are sending @xmath44 real symbols ( one on each dimension ) in @xmath39 channel uses .",
    "alternatively , we can pair two real variables at a time and view it as @xmath59 complex symbols being transmitted in @xmath39 channel uses",
    ". we would like to mention that most of the previous works on stbcs follow the convention of measuring rate in complex symbols per channel use which in our case is @xmath60 complex symbols per channel use and is simply proportional to rate as per definition [ defn_rate ] . though the terminology of basis matrices and rate have been used previously in the literature ( for example see @xcite ) , to the knowledge of the authors , rate of a stbc has not been defined explicitly and clearly as in definition [ defn_rate ] although many works in the literature may be measuring rate in a similar way .",
    "note that if linear independence of basis matrices is not retained and if rate were to be measured by simply counting the number of complex variables in the lstd , then one can claim to have any arbitrary rate of transmission which can be quite deceptive at times .",
    "the notion of linear independence makes things clear and avoids such confusions . definition [ defn_rate ]",
    "is particularly useful because it essentially allows to define rate of a lstd , hence allowing us to separate the study of lstds from stbcs .",
    "also , we argue that rate as per definition [ defn_rate ] is a first order indicative of coding gain and hence is a parameter which has to be maximized . intuitively , the higher the dimension , the more efficiently we can pack codewords in it optimizing some criteria",
    ". one of the criteria of interest is to maximize the coding gain which is given by @xmath61 .    recall that even in the case of classical linear error correcting codes over finite fields , rate was defined as the ratio of the dimension of the subspace spanned by the codewords to the number of channel uses . in the case of classical linear error correcting codes , the code itself is a subspace whereas in the case of stbcs , the code is a subset of a subspace .",
    "the following examples of existing stbcs reinforce the statement that rate as per definition [ defn_rate ] is a first order indicative of coding gain .",
    "[ eg_al_gc ] let us consider the alamouti code @xcite and the golden code @xcite which are given by : @xmath62 $ ] and + @xmath63 $ ] respectively where , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in both cases ,",
    "the real variables are allowed to take values independently from a finite subset of @xmath68 .",
    "it can be checked that there are @xmath3 basis matrices for the alamouti code and @xmath69 basis matrices for the golden code .",
    "thus the rate of alamouti code and golden code are @xmath0 dpcu and @xmath3 dpcu respectively and it is well known @xcite that the golden code outperforms the alamouti code when they are both compared with the same transmission rate in bpcu .",
    "[ eg_od_qod ] let us consider the @xmath1 od and the @xmath1 quasi orthogonal design .",
    "they are given by : @xmath70 $ ] and + @xmath71 $ ] respectively .",
    "their respective rates can be verified to be @xmath72 dpcu and @xmath0 dpcu respectively .",
    "stbcs from quasi orthogonal designs are known to outperform stbcs from ods @xcite for the same transmission rate in bpcu .",
    "the above examples show that given two stbcs having the same number of codewords , the one having higher rate as per definition [ defn_rate ] outperforms the other in most cases , thus providing a good motivation for definition [ defn_rate ] .       + towards defining a measure for ml decoding complexity , let us first define a measure of encoding complexity .",
    "if we use for encoding a stbc using lstds , we see that in general one needs to choose an element from @xmath57 and then substitute for the real variables @xmath53 in the lstd .",
    "this method of encoding clearly requires a lookup table ( memory ) with @xmath73 entries .",
    "however , if the signal set @xmath57 is a cartesian product of @xmath74 smaller signal sets in dimension @xmath75 , then the complexity can be reduced . to be precise , if @xmath76 where each @xmath77 with cardinality @xmath78 , then the stbc @xmath34 itself decomposes as a sum of @xmath74 different stbcs , which is shown below",
    "let @xmath79 .",
    "then by appropriately reordering / relabeling the real variables we can assume without loss of generality real variables belong to first group and the second @xmath80 real variables belong to the second group and the last @xmath80 real variables belong to the @xmath74-th group .",
    "in general , the partitioning of real variables into @xmath74-groups can be quite arbitrary . ] that @xmath81 where , @xmath82 and + @xmath83^t$ ] .",
    "hence the stbc decomposes as @xmath84 where , @xmath85    @xcite [ defn_g_enc ] a stbc @xmath86 is said to @xmath74-group encodable or @xmath75 real symbol encodable ( or @xmath87 complex symbol decodable ) if @xmath76 where each @xmath77 with cardinality @xmath78 .",
    "the encoding of a @xmath74-group encodable stbc is pictorially shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_g_enc ] .",
    "thus the encoding complexity of @xmath74-group encodable stbcs is @xmath88 .",
    "note that in addition if @xmath89 then the memory required for encoding is also minimized .",
    "consider the example of the golden code which was discussed in example [ eg_al_gc ] .",
    "as per definition [ defn_g_enc ] , the golden code is @xmath69-group encodable or single real symbol encodable .",
    "thus we have seen how a @xmath74-group encodable stbc @xmath34 decomposes into a sum of @xmath74 stbcs + @xmath90 and thus admits independent encoding of the @xmath91 s .",
    "a natural question that follows is : under what conditions does a @xmath74-group encodable stbc @xmath34 admit independent decoding of the constituent @xmath91 s ? towards that end , let us look at the ml decoding metric .",
    "let @xmath17 be the transmitted codeword of size @xmath36 , @xmath92 be the @xmath93 channel matrix and @xmath94 be the received matrix of size @xmath95 .",
    "then , the ml decoder is given by    @xmath96    for a @xmath74-group encodable stbc @xmath34 , @xmath97 for some @xmath98 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that if the basis matrices @xmath55 satisfy the condition    @xmath99    then the ml decoder decomposes as    @xmath100    in other words , the component stbcs @xmath91 s can then be decoded independently .",
    "it can also be shown @xcite that is a necessary condition for this to happen .",
    "note that the subspaces @xmath101 intersect trivially , i.e. , @xmath102 . thus @xmath103 .",
    "if the condition in is satisfied for the basis matrices , then it implies that @xmath104 . in other words , this becomes a property of the two subspaces @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",

    "all stbcs obtained from ods are single real symbol decodable if every real variable in the od takes values independently from a pam ( pulse amplitude modulation ) signal set . as an example , consider the alamouti code that was previously discussed in example [ eg_al_gc ] .",
    "the associated basis matrices are @xmath107 $ ] , @xmath108 $ ] , @xmath109 $ ] and @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "it can be checked that they satisfy the condition in for @xmath111 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "hence the alamouti code is single real symbol decodable .",
    "the ml decoding for a @xmath74-group decodable code is illustrated pictorially in fig .",
    "[ fig_g_dec ] .",
    "it is clear that the decoding complexity is reduced for @xmath74-group decodable stbcs from @xmath116 computations to @xmath117 computations .",
    "further , we know that the sphere decoder @xcite is an efficient ml decoder if vector @xmath56 takes values from a lattice constellation .",
    "moreover , it has been shown @xcite that the average complexity of a sphere decoder depends on the dimension of the equivalent lattice @xcite and more or less independent of the size of the code .",
    "thus , we can take the dimension of the corresponding equivalent lattice as a measure of the sphere decoder complexity . for a general stbc ,",
    "this dimension is equal to @xmath44 whereas for @xmath74-group ml decodable stbcs , it is @xmath118 .",
    "thus the expected as well as the worst case ml decoding complexity is lesser for @xmath74-group ml decodable stbcs .",
    "+ apart from rate and ml decoding complexity , yet another important aspect of stbcs is the diversity gain .",
    "diversity gain is a measure of the slope of the error probability versus the snr when plotted on a log - log scale and this is given by @xmath119 .",
    "thus full diversity of @xmath120 is achieved by a stbc if the coding gain is not equal to zero .",
    "+ having surveyed three important aspects of rate , ml decoding complexity and diversity for a stbc , we can now pose the problem of rate - ml decoding complexity tradeoff .",
    "this problem can be formally stated in two equivalent ways which are listed down as given below .    1",
    ".   given @xmath80 , @xmath39 and @xmath121 what is the maximum rate of any full diversity stbc ?",
    "2 .   given @xmath74 , @xmath39 and @xmath121 what is the maximum rate of any full diversity stbc ?",
    "if @xmath122 and @xmath123 , then the solution is precisely the stbcs from square orthogonal designs constructed in @xcite for which the maximum rate is @xmath124 dpcu . in this paper ,",
    "the maximum rate of a certain class of full diversity square stbcs from clifford unitary weight designs is characterized for @xmath125 .",
    "the following example illustrates that full diversity and encoding / decoding complexity are related indirectly .",
    "[ eg_4x4_ciod ] consider the @xmath1 co - ordinate interleaved orthogonal design ( ciod ) @xcite given by @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "the weight matrices of the above lstd satisfy @xmath127 .",
    "let the notation @xmath128 stand for the codeword difference matrix .",
    "note that @xmath129 , which will equal to zero for some pair of codeword matrices if all the @xmath69 real variables are allowed to take values independently .",
    "hence , it is not possible to obtain a full diversity single real symbol decodable stbc from the above lstd .",
    "however , by entangling two real variables , as for example @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and then allowing them to take values from a rotated qam constellation ( rotating a qam constellation entangles the variables ) , a full diversity , single complex symbol ml decodable stbc can be obtained @xcite .",
    "the resulting stbc will be @xmath3-group ml decodable or @xmath0-real symbol ml decodable and its associated four constituent stbcs are given by @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "example [ eg_4x4_ciod ] shows that the requirement of full diversity can sometimes demand an increase in the encoding complexity and hence the decoding complexity even if the associated weight matrices satisfy condition for @xmath122 .",
    "thus , it is clear that full diversity and encoding / decoding complexity are inter - related and there exists a tradeoff between the two .",
    "first , let us classify square lstds ( as done in @xcite for single complex symbol decodable codes ) .",
    "lstds can be broadly classified as unitary weight designs ( uwds ) and non unitary weight designs ( nuwds ) .",
    "a uwd is one for which all the weight matrices are unitary and nuwds are defined as those which are not uwds .",
    "clifford unitary weight designs ( cuwds ) are a proper subclass of uwds whose weight matrices satisfy certain sufficient conditions for @xmath74-group ml decodability . to state those sufficient conditions , let us list down the weight matrices of a cuwd in the form of an array as shown in table [ table_cuwd ] .",
    ".structure of cuwds [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this code is @xmath138 real symbol decodable and achieves full diversity for appropriately chosen signal sets .",
    "example [ eg_5relay ] illustrates how the proposed transmission scheme can be employed for odd number of relays as well .",
    "note that the ml decoding complexity of the proposed codes for asynchronous relay networks is significantly less compared to all other distributed space time codes for asynchronous cooperative diversity known in the literature .",
    "note that the full diversity , @xmath0-group ml decodable dstbcs in @xcite and the full diversity , @xmath4-group ml decodable dstbcs in @xcite also satisfy the conditions in and are applicable in the proposed ofdm based transmission scheme .      in this subsection , it is shown how differential encoding can be combined with the proposed transmission scheme described in subsection [ subsec4_2 ] and the distributed differential space time codes for noncoherent synchronous relay networks in @xcite are proposed for application in this setting .    for the transmission scheme described in subsection [ subsec4_2 ] , at the end of one transmission frame , we have in the @xmath139-th sub carrier @xmath140 .",

    "we observe that the error performance of the proposed codes are very similar to the @xmath4-group ml decodable dstbc from field extensions @xcite .",

    "two cases are considered for simulation : ( i ) with channel knowledge at the destination and ( ii ) without channel knowledge at any node .",

    "coherent detection is done at the destination in every sub carrier . for the case of no channel knowledge ,",
    "differential encoding is done at the source as described in example [ eg_4relay_diff ] and a modified signal set ( as explained in @xcite for scaled unitary codewords ) is employed .",
    "also , differential detection is done at the destination in every sub carrier .",
    "simulations are done for transmission rates ( neglecting rate loss due to cp ) of @xmath4 bpcu and @xmath0 bpcu in both the cases .",
    "the error performance curves for both the cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_simulation_asyn ] .",
    "it can be observed that the error performance for the no channel knowledge case performs approximately @xmath190 db worse and @xmath69 db worse compared to that with channel knowledge for transmission rates of @xmath4 bpcu and @xmath0 bpcu respectively .",
    "this is partly due to the differential transmission / reception technique ( which increases the effective noise seen by destination ) and also in part , because of the change in signal set from rotated qam to some other signal set @xcite for scaled unitary codeword matrices .",
    "the change in signal set for the sake of scaled unitary codeword matrices results in a reduction of the coding gain .",
    "in this paper , the problem of optimal rate - ml decoding complexity within the framework of multi - group decodable stbcs was posed .",
    "then an algebraic framework for studying cuw stbcs was introduced using which the optimal rate - ml decoding complexity tradeoff of cuw stbcs was obtained and several optimal code constructions were also provided . then the paper focused on constructing multi - group decodable dstbcs and three new classes of four group decodable dstbcs were constructed .",
    "the ofdm based transmission scheme in @xcite was extended to a more general transmission scheme for arbitrary number of relays that can achieve full cooperative diversity in the presence of timing errors at the relay nodes .",
    "it was then pointed out that the four group decodable dstbcs constructed in this paper can be applied in the proposed transmission scheme for any number of relay nodes .",
    "a drawback of the proposed transmission scheme is that it requires a large coherence interval spanning over multiple ofdm symbol durations .",
    "moreover there is a rate loss due to the use of cp , however this loss can be made negligible by choosing a large enough @xmath158 .",
    "finally , it was shown how differential encoding at the source node can be combined with this ofdm based transmission strategy to arrive at a new transmission strategy than can achieve full cooperative diversity in asynchronous relay networks with no channel knowledge as well as no timing error knowledge .",
    "the distributed differential stbcs in @xcite were then proposed for application in this setting for power of two number of relays .",
    "some of the interesting directions for further work are as listed below :    1 .",
    "the cuw stbcs are based on sufficient conditions for @xmath74-group ml decodability .",
    "an algebraic framework for @xmath74-group ml decodable stbcs based on the necessary and sufficient conditions and the optimal rate - ml decoding complexity tradeoff of general @xmath74-group ml decodable stbcs is an important open problem .",
    "2 .   how to construct @xmath74-group decodable dstbcs for @xmath191 ? in particular , constructing single symbol decodable dstbcs for the synchronous as well as asynchronous cases is worth investigating .",
    "some initial results in this direction have been reported in @xcite .",
    "3 .   in the results pertaining to asynchronous relay networks",
    ", we have assumed that there are no frequency offsets at the relay nodes .",
    "extending this work to asynchronous relay networks with frequency offsets is an interesting direction for further work .",
    "this problem has been addressed in @xcite for the case of two relay nodes .",
