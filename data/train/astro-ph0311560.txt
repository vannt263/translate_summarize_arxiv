    "ray binaries are binary systems in which a @xmath81@xmath9 star transfers matter to a neutron star or a black hole . a large fraction of the low  mass x ",
    "ray binaries is transient ; these systems form the so called soft x  ray transients ( sxts ) .",
    "the characterising property of sxts is that the accretion rate drops several orders of magnitude when the source returns to quiescence ( ) .",
    "sxts have been and are being studied extensively with previous and present x  ray satellites ; for an overview of sxts see .",
    "using data obtained with the beppo _ sax _ satellite and suggested that @xmath510 bursting neutron stars form a separate class of _ faint _ sxts ; the outburst peak luminosity is low ( typically @xmath10 erg s@xmath1 ) .",
    "later , argued that a class of faint sxt could be explained evolutionarily . argues that faint sxts should have evolved beyond the period minimum of @xmath580 minutes to orbital periods of 80120 minutes .",
    "using the _ chandra _ and _ xmm / newton _ satellites it is possible to study these systems even when they are in quiescence ( cf .  ; ; ) . a large fraction of the neutron star sxt quiescent x  ray luminosity is often ascribed to cooling of the hot neutron star core and/or crust ( cf .",
    "assuming that the thermal spectral component is coming from the neutron star surface , in principle neutron star parameters such as the mass and radius can be derived when using a neutron star atmosphere model to fit the spectrum (; ; ) .",
    "the quiescent luminosity of the neutron star sxt and accreting millisecond x  ray pulsar sax  j1808.43658 was found to be very low ( l@xmath11 erg s@xmath1 ; ) .",
    "this is nearly as low as the luminosities found for several quiescent bhc sxts with a short orbital period ( ) . such a low neutron star luminosity could result if the neutron star core and crust are relatively cool ( ) .",
    "this in turn could hint at a massive neutron star ( m@xmath12 m@xmath7 ; ) , or a very low time  averaged mass accretion rate ( ) .",
    "several other emission mechanisms have been proposed to explain the quiescent luminosity of sxts as well .",
    "first , in quiescence mass accretion may be ongoing at a low level ( , possibly via an advection dominated accretion flow , e.g.  ) .",
    "second , shocks formed by the propeller mechanism preventing accretion onto the neutron star may produce x  rays (; ) .",
    "third , the switch  on of a radio pulsar mechanism may produce the observed x ",
    "rays ( ) . finally , leaking of matter through the magnetospere especially at high latitudes in an adaf  like spherical flow may produce x ",
    "rays ( e.g.  ) .",
    "the quiescent source luminosity seems to be a characterising difference between the systems containing a neutron star and those containing a black hole candidate ( bhc ) compact object . when plotted versus the binary orbital period the neutron star sxts seem to be systematically brighter by a factor of @xmath510 than the bhc sxts ( cf .  ) .",
    "a possible and exciting explanation is that in the bhc sxts energy is advected across the event horizon and not thermalised and radiated away like in neutron star sxts (; ) .",
    "however , suggested that the difference between the quiescent x  ray luminosities from neutron stars and bhc sxts could also be explained by taking into account the jet power .",

    "the observation started at 21:20:35 terrestrial time .",
    "the x  ray data were processed by the _ chandra _ x  ray centre ; events with asca grades of 1 , 5 , 7 , cosmic rays , hot pixels , and events close to ccd node boundaries were rejected .",

    "both systems were proposed to be members of the class of recently recognised sub  group of _ faint _ neutron star sxts (; ) .",
    "obviously , if one would underestimate the source distance of the faint systems by a factor of a few one could derive anomalously low values for the luminosity .",

    "the typical error in the distance estimate as derived from the radius expansion burst is 15 per cent .",
    "this is insufficient to explain the difference in outburst and quiescent luminosity between the faint and normal neutron star sxts .",
    "the low luminosity of sax  j1810.82609 in quiescence hence strengthens the case for the existence of the class of faint ( neutron star ) sxts .",
    "the quiescent luminosity of neutron star sxts has been ascribed to thermal cooling of the hot neutron star crust / core ( ) . however",
    ", this interpretation is not without problems .",
    "as was noted by several authors ( among which themselves , see also ) , thermal cooling can not explain the power  law spectral component . as mentioned in the introduction , a low quiescent luminosity could arise if the neutron star is more massive than @xmath34 m@xmath7 since in that case enhanced core cooling due to the direct urca process could take place ( )",
    ". however , the neutron star core could also be cold if the time  averaged mass accretion rate onto the neutron star is very low ( ) . in case of sax  j1810.82609 the time average mass accretion rate necessary to explain the flux coming from the thermal spectral component would be 5.7@xmath6 m@xmath7 yr@xmath1 assuming that the amount of heat deposited in the crust per accreted nucleon is 1.45 mev ( assuming that only standard core cooling processes are at work ; see ) .",
    "initially , the relatively large variability found in the temperature associated with the soft component in cen  x4 and aql  x1 was regarded as a problem for the cooling neutron star model (; ) and only if the neutron stars are massive could the variability be explained ( ) .",
    "however , found that since the residual hydrogen and helium mass in the neutron star atmosphere varies from one outburst to the next the thermal quiescent flux can vary between outbursts by a factor of 23 .",
    "however , found that the quiescent thermal flux of aql  x1 after an outburst first decreased by up to 50 per cent and then increased again by 35 per cent on timescales of a month .",
    "it also varied by nearly 40 per cent on short time scales ( ksec ) . concluded that accretion ongoing at a low level is the most likely explanation ( however , it is unclear why the the luminosity agrees well with the predictions from deep crustal heating .",
    "see also for an alternative explanation ) . also considered the possibility that mass accretion is ongoing at a low rate when the systems are in quiescence . showed that emergent spectra of neutron stars accreting at a low rate would resemble a thermal spectrum albeit overall hardened .",
    "we investigated the observational findings of neutron star sxts in quiescence .",
    "there is evidence that in sources which have a low quiescent source luminosity the contribution of the power",
    " law component to the spectrum is large compared with more luminous neutron star sources in quiescence .",
    "the source with the lowest luminosity , sax  j1808.43658 has a spectrum which is well  fitted with just a power  law ( ) .",
    "other sources like cen  x4 and sax  j1810.82609 with luminosity , l , 10@xmath35l@xmath36 erg s@xmath1 show a power  law component which contributes up to about 50 per cent of the source luminosity ( cf .  ; ; this work ) . sources with luminosity near 10@xmath37 erg s@xmath1 like x  5 and x  7 in the globular cluster 47  tucanae ( ) are well  fit without the power ",
    "law component .",
    "most quiescent neutron star sxts in globular clusters fit this trend ( the addition of a power  law component to the fit was never necessary to obtain a good fit , ) .",
    "however , the neutron star sxt in terzan 5 and aql  x1 complicate the picture .",
    "their quiescent spectrum is dominated by or in the case of aql  x1 has a power  law component even though the quiescence luminosity is high @xmath524@xmath3810@xmath37 erg s@xmath1 ( for terzan 5 see ; for aql  x1 see e.g.  ; ) .",
    "perhaps the power ",
    "law spectral component at source luminosities higher than 10@xmath37 erg s@xmath1 has a different origin than those at lower source luminosities .    finally , as was noted before ( cf .  ) , we like to point out that assuming the observed black body radiation is caused by residual accretion and not a cooling neutron star crust the power  law spectral component at the lowest source luminosities ( i.e.  those found in sax  j1808.43658 ) could be similar in nature to the one found for black hole candidate sxts in quiescence .",
