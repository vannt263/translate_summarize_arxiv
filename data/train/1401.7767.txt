    "one of the cornerstones of modern cosmology is understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies and the relative importance of merger processes .",
    "according to cold dark matter ( @xmath4cdm ) structure formation models , galaxies form hierarchically : dark matter collapses into halos in the early universe , which virialise and cluster hierarchically to form large - scale structures .",
    "rotating discs start forming in slowly growing dark matter halos @xcite and become the building blocks of galaxies @xcite . in this framework of a merger - dominated universe ,",
    "galaxies without a bulge are difficult to produce : the discs will thicken or warp due to interactions between low mass halos @xcite or be completely disrupted by major mergers @xcite , leaving behind a classical bulge .",
    "halos that somehow escape or at least avoid major mergers since @xmath53 could , in principle , form bulgeless galaxies , especially if some form of heuristic prescription for stellar feedback is included in the simulations @xcite , but the simulated disks end up being smaller , denser and having lower angular momentum than the observed ones .",
    "however , more recent hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies show that outflows can prevent the formation of classical merger - driven bulges in low mass systems by expelling most of the low angular momentum gas generated in such events @xcite .",
    "the observed correlations between black hole ( bh ) mass and host galaxy properties ( such as , stellar velocity dispersion , circum - nuclear star formation , mass , and luminosity ; see e.g. , @xcite ) are rarely observed in galaxies with no bulges ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter referred as k11 ) , thus suggesting that the formation and evolution of galaxy bulges are linked to the formation and evolution of the host bhs , albeit perhaps differently in early- and late - type objects @xcite .",
    "the growth of a bh in a bulgeless galaxy remains difficult to understand in the absence of merger processes . on the other hand ,",
    "several observations of bhs and agn in nearby bulgeless galaxies currently indicate that a classical bulge is not a requirement for an ( active ) nuclear bh : ngc  4395 @xcite is a bulgeless sm galaxy with a seyfert  1 spectrum , pox  52 @xcite is a dwarf seyfert  1 galaxy , henize  2 - 10 is the first ever ( irregular ) dwarf discovered to have a supermassive bh @xcite , whereas ngc  3621 , ngc  4178 , ngc  3367 , ngc  4536 , and ngc  4561 @xcite , are late - type sd galaxies with agn activity from low mass black holes . also , @xcite found a high incidence of agn activity in a sample of late - type spirals observed with _",
    "chandra _ , indicating that bhs can evolve in galaxies with little or no evidence for bulges .",
    "@xcite found no correlation between bh and disc masses in a sample of 11  galaxies .",
    "@xcite analysed ten pseudo - bulge narrow line seyfert  1 ( nls  1 ) galaxies and compared the bh mass to the pseudo - bulge luminosity , finding that the bhs were undermassive compared to the host galaxies .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that bhs in pseudo - bulges / disc galaxies are in the growth mode at the present epoch and that this growth is triggered by secular processes . in this context ,",
    "bhs / agn found in bulgeless galaxies are thought to be the smallest bhs grown by local processes and are the seeds of the larger merger - grown smbhs found in massive galaxies .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has been used to establish a benchmark for the local universe @xcite and to investigate the significance of agn feedback in bulgeless galaxies , including quenching of star formation @xcite .",
    "recently , a sample of 13  agn in bulgeless galaxies with bh masses in the range @xmath6 was selected from the sdss using visual classification from the galaxy zoo @xcite .",
    "the authors showed that significant bh growth can take place in the absence of mergers or violent disc instabilities .",
    "given the importance of bulgeless galaxies to understand galaxy evolution , a study of these objects at higher redshifts is fundamental .",
    "the existence of a set of very deep and high - resolution observations with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) allows to extend morphological local studies , as those performed with sdss , to much higher redshifts , and start mapping the evolution of bulgeless galaxies . here",
    "we present a catalogue and a first analysis of such systems at intermediate redshift ( @xmath0 ) , using publicly available data from four of the largest , deepest multi - wavelength surveys : the cosmological evolutionary survey ( cosmos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the all - wavelength extended groth strip ( egs ) international survey ( aegis ; * ? ? ? * ) , the galaxy evolution from morphology and seds ( gems ) survey @xcite , and the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the latter survey targets two separate fields , the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n , hereafter referred to as goods - n ) and the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s , hereafter referred to as goods - s ) .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "data for all these fields have been recently assembled by @xcite into a single homogeneously analysed data - set .    besides high - resolution",
    "optical imaging , these fields also possess very comprehensive multi - wavelength coverage , from x - rays to radio , as well as vast spectroscopic information .",
    "the synergy of such a panchromatic data - set offers us the opportunity to investigate the significance of bulgeless galaxies and bulgeless agn hosts when the universe was less than one - half of its current age ( more than 7gyr in the past ) , an epoch much more active than the current one .",
    "this can provide valuable insight into the understanding of the evolutionary path of bulgeless systems within the overall galaxy formation and evolutionary scenario .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in   [ sec : sample ] and   [ sec : anc ] we describe the data - set and present the derivation of the relevant rest - frame quantities ; in ",
    "[ sec : bgcat ] we present the final magnitude - limited ( @xmath7 ) catalogue containing @xmath8 bulgeless galaxies at intermediate redshift ( @xmath0 ) , and investigate the reliability of the adopted morphological classification , as well as the accuracy of the mass estimates . in ",

    "finally , a summary of this work is given in ",
    "[ sec : summ ] .    throughout the article we use h@xmath9=71 km",

    "the present study is based on the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) _ hst _ public morphology catalogue , which has been recently assembled by @xcite , merging the largest _ hst _ imaging surveys .",
    "the catalogue contains a total of 469501 sources in five sky fields : cosmos ( 304688 sources ) , aegis ( 70142 sources ) , gems ( 59447 sources ) , goods - s ( 10999 sources ) , and goods - n ( 24225 sources ) .",
    "this large acs data - set has been homogeneously analysed using the code galapagos @xcite , an application that combines object detection with sextractor @xcite and light profile modelling with galfit @xcite .",
    "these data provide the basis to extract precise morphological parameters for the galaxies .",
    "a thorough description of the acs general catalogue ( henceforth referred to as the acs - gc ) , its contents , additional data products , and details of its construction from hst / acs images , are given in @xcite .",
    "a brief summary of the acs - gc imaging data is also reported here in table  [ tab : surveys ] , giving central coordinates for the surveys , survey size , filters and pixel scales . in the following",
    ", we outline those details which are pertinent to the context of the present investigation .",
    "the morphological classification was derived from the analysis of the surface brightness profiles , obtained at the reddest filter image available for each field , namely @xmath13 for the cosmos and egs fields , @xmath14 for the gems + goods - s fields , and @xmath15 for the goods",
    "- n field .",
    "the light distribution of the galaxies was analysed by fitting a single srsic profile @xcite : @xmath16 where the srsic index @xmath17 describes the shape of the light profile , @xmath18 is the effective radius of the galaxy , and @xmath19 is a positive parameter that is coupled to @xmath17 , such that half of the total flux is always within @xmath18 .",
    "an index @xmath20 corresponds to an exponential profile of a typical pure - disc galaxy , whereas @xmath21 corresponds to the de  vancouleurs profile of elliptical or spheroidal galaxies .    in order to improve the robustness of the morphology selection",
    ", we rejected the faintest galaxies by imposing a magnitude cut , @xmath22 , in the filter considered for each field ( see above ) . to avoid sources with very little or no morphological information , we removed point sources from the sample in the following way .",
    "pixel sizes in the adopted surveys range from 0.05arcsec for cosmos ( acs / wide field channel ) , to 0.03arcsec ( acs / high resolution channel ) for aegis , gems and goods . for an average acs psf of  0.075arcsec ,",
    "point - like sources occupy just over one to two pixels .",
    "we thus discarded catalogue entries with a half - light radius smaller than 0.15arcsec ( two times the psf ) .",
    "we further discarded all sources with a @xmath23 axis ratio less than 0.5 ( equivalent to inclinations larger than 60deg ) , in order to minimise the effects of dust extinction on galaxy colours . at this stage",
    "the galaxy sample contains 78830 sources .",
    "it should be considered that galaxy appearance may depend on the rest - frame wavelength at which it is observed , thus comparison of the morphology of galaxies observed at different redshift or through different filters should be treated with additional care .",
    "given the redshift interval under study ( @xmath0 ) and the filters adopted , we are sampling a rest - frame range of @xmath24 39006100 , where the morphological @xmath25-correction is found to be not significant for most galaxies .",

    "they do not show an appreciable evolution in mass ( the fraction of galaxies with @xmath114 remains approximately constant at @xmath115 irrespective of redshift bin ) and move slightly towards redder colours with cosmic time , an effect of the ageing of the stellar population . on the lower mass end of the distribution ( @xmath116 )",
    ", there exists a less numerous , but still appreciable , population of bulge - dominated galaxies , reaching the blue cloud",
    ". these could be low - mass bulge - dominated galaxies hosted in low - density groups , where they are able to sustain appreciable star formation , possibly via `` wet merger '' events .",

    ". moreover , some blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) , particularly those classified as ne types in @xcite , also show surface brightness profiles fitted by a de  vaucouleurs @xmath117 profile @xcite .",
    "assessing the proper nature of these objects is beyond the scope of this study , however we refer to @xcite for a more detailed analysis of the environment of blue early - type galaxies at intermediate redshift .    the intermediate ",
    "type population ( with @xmath118 , _ central panels _ of figure  [ fig : g - r_vs_mass ] ) is mainly composed of disc or spiral galaxies having a prominent bulge . in the high - redshift end of the diagram they extend from the red sequence to the blue cloud region , whereas at lower-@xmath29 they are more concentrated in the blue / low - mass region .",
    "this agrees with the conclusions of previous studies on galaxy evolution @xcite , although these authors have used a different morphological classification scheme .",
    "concerning the bulgeless galaxies , if we focus on the high - mass end ( e.g. , for @xmath114 , where our sample is complete at all @xmath29 ) , one can see a decreasing number of objects from @xmath119 to the lowest redshift bin . to take properly into account the survey volume effects",
    ", we evaluated the number density evolution of each morphological type for stellar masses @xmath114 .",

    "the fact that early - type objects , in the selected mass range , show little or no evolution is in agreement with the most massive e / s0 galaxies being already in place at @xmath121 and evolve only weakly since then @xcite . on the other hand",

    "their simulations were unable to reasonably fit the observed data for all morphological types simultaneously , even including small accretion events in the model .",
    "most notably , all the models over - predict the mass fraction of bulgeless disc galaxies as cosmic time proceeds .",
    "thus , it is likely that these objects undergo a bulge - building process driven by disc dynamical instability , possibly triggered by secular accretion activity @xcite .    as a final remark",
    ", we remind that the possible bias introduced by the point - source rejection is estimated to be weak and scarcely redshift dependent ( see discussion in   [ sec : bgcat ] ) , so that its effects are expected to be within the error bars shown in figure  [ fig : n - dens ] .",
    "recent studies @xcite demonstrated that the srsic index , among other galaxy quantities , correlates best with the lack of star - formation activity . at @xmath122 ,",
    "large sersc indices correlate extremely well with quiescence , as shown by @xcite using a sdss sample .",
    "it is argued that `` genuine '' bulgeless quiescent galaxies could be either ( @xmath71 ) satellite galaxies in high - mass halos , whose gas is stripped in a deep potential well , or ( @xmath123 ) possibly a result of incorrect morphological classification , given that many of them show a hint of a bulge once visual examination is performed .",
    "quenched bulgeless galaxies are rather rare up to high redshift ( @xmath124 , * ? ? ?",

    "[ sec : colours ] , it is known that the red sequence is mostly composed of galaxies with elliptical morphology and prominent bulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , it also hosts a small fraction of dusty , late - type , reddened star - forming objects @xcite and spi / irr galaxies , with quenched star - formation ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig : red - seq ] ( _ left panel _ ) shows that a significant fraction of the bulgeless population is located in the red sequence region of the colour  mass diagram .",
    "finding red bulgeless galaxies gives evidence for an intriguing population of late - type objects  their optically red nature may result from substantial dust obscuration but it could also indicate that they have ceased forming stars , thus revealing a mechanism that induces quiescence without significantly altering the morphology .",
    "a way to break the degeneracy between dusty star - forming and red quiescent galaxies is the use of rest - frame near - infrared  optical colours @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "essentially , the @xmath127 colour provides a proxy for unobscured star - formation activity , whereas @xmath128 helps in highlighting dust - free quiescent galaxies that exhibit a bluer colour than dusty objects , and thus occupy a different _ locus _ in the @xmath129 plane .",
    "the relevant plot is shown in the _ right panel _ of figure  [ fig : red - seq ] .",

    "[ sec : colours ] .",
    "the plot indicates that most of the bulgeless galaxies that are red in the @xmath107/mass diagram owe their optical colour to dust instead of an old stellar population , with only a few objects located in the region of the diagram corresponding to quiescent galaxies .",
    "figures [ fig : g - r_vs_mass ] and [ fig : n - dens ] show that our sample includes a non - negligible fraction of massive [ @xmath130 bulgeless galaxies which contribute to @xmath84 30% of the total galaxy population number density at @xmath131 .",
    "overall , we find  2339 out of  19233 bulgeless galaxies ( 12% ) with @xmath132 , and  1.5% of the sample consists of very massive systems with @xmath133 .",
    "the existence of such massive bulgeless galaxies challenges the current picture of galaxy formation , because , in principle , they require a hierarchical growth to reach such large masses .",
    "it is not entirely clear how they can increase their masses through mergers without destroying their stellar discs and forming a classical bulge @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown that gas - rich mergers can produce a large disc instead of a spheroidal system @xcite .",
    "discs can survive or rapidly regrow after a merging event provided that the gas fraction in the discs of the progenitors is high @xcite . at @xmath119",
    "massive bulgeless galaxies are less numerous compared to early - type galaxies , but are more abundant than intermediate - type at similar mass range ( figure [ fig : n - dens ] ) .",
    "their number density decreases with redshift , reducing by a factor of 2 from @xmath121 to  0.4 , and they are rare in the local universe @xcite . this trend is also found in similar studies of galactic morphological evolution within the same redshift range @xcite .",
    "the gradual disappearance of very massive bulgeless galaxies at recent times might imply a process that accompanies the growth of their stellar masses and tends to transform them into an earlier type morphology through the formation of a classical bulge .    to explore this possibility",
    "we have used _",
    "spitzer _ and _ galex _ data to derive both ultraviolet and infrared star forming rates ( sfrs ) , to investigate the star - forming properties of the most massive galaxies in our sample .",
    "as mentioned in section   [ sec : mir - data ] , _ spitzer _ space telescope observations are available for the cosmos , aegis and gems / goods - s fields .",
    "overall , 5574 sources ( 29% ) out of the entire bulgeless galaxy sample have a good photometric measurement at 24@xmath52 m .",
    "interestingly , @xmath8480% ( 228/296 ) of the very massive ( @xmath134 ) bulgeless sample has a 24@xmath52 m measurement .",
    "the total infrared luminosity , @xmath135 ( 8 - 1000@xmath52 m ) , is determined following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "starting from the 24@xmath52 m flux densities , we used the sed templates of ngc3351 to reproduce the corresponding rest - frame luminosity and to derive the integrated @xmath135 of that template .",
    "infrared and ultraviolet sfrs were determined from @xmath135 and @xmath136 rest - frame luminosities , and added together to obtain an estimate of the total sfr for each galaxy .",
    "the sfrs range between 10 and 100@xmath137yr@xmath10 and the distribution peaks at roughly 20 - 30@xmath137yr@xmath10 ( figure  [ fig : massive ] ; _ left panel _ ) . for comparison , we plotted the relation found by @xcite for galaxies with masses @xmath138@xmath137 at @xmath139 ( sf main sequence ) , and the corresponding line defining a four time higher sfr . despite the scatter it appears that massive bulgeless have a higher ( roughly twice ) specific sfr than same mass galaxies located along the sf main sequence , but they do not show evidence of starburst activity which would imply sfr ten time higher than the trend defined by the sf main sequence .",
    "the most massive galaxies in our sample ( @xmath133 ) have an average sfr of about 50@xmath137yr@xmath10 , implying that they can nearly double their stellar mass due to their star - formation activity over @xmath140gyr .",
    "this is less than the look - back time spanned by our redshift range , corresponding to @xmath141gyr .",
    "these galaxies are clearly different in nature to a fairly massive spiral like the milky way .",
    "their sfr is more than 30  times higher than the galactic one , while not reaching the extreme nature of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "if their intense star - formation activity , as suggested by their high far - infrared luminosities @xmath142 , is concentrated in the centre , it is plausible that a fraction of the additional mass formed from their star - formation activity may lead to the formation of a bulge , contributing to the morphological transformation necessary to evolve into a massive disc galaxy with a bulge .",
    "this might explain why massive bulgeless galaxies are relatively rare in the local universe .",
    "the presence of a bar may also be related to the morphological transformation of bulgeless galaxies . in the disc - instability scenario , low angular momentum material in the centre of a disc",
    "is assumed to form a bar due to a global instability @xcite .",
    "galactic bars induce inflow of interstellar gas towards the centre , and the gas accumulated at the galactic centre provides raw material for the bulge component @xcite .",
    "finally , one can not exclude that the disappearance of massive bulgeless galaxies is related to mergers producing bulge - dominated discs or spheroidals .",
    "thus , it is important to analyse the local environment where these systems reside in order to investigate this possibility in more detail .",
    "the study of the environmental properties of massive bulgeless galaxies , as well as a more detailed analysis of the multi - colour hst images of these systems to search for centrally enhanced star - formation activity or the presence of bars , will be the focus of future papers .",
    "having assembled a statistically significant sample of bulgeless galaxies at intermediate redshift , we carried out a sistematic search for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) candidates to verify their existence in pure disc systems .",
    "x - ray emission is generally recognised as a robust indicator of agn activity since it does not suffer from heavy dust or gas extinction and contamination from star - formation in the host galaxy is relatively weak .",
    "x - rays from agn are produced in the inner and hottest nuclear region of the galaxy , where accretion onto the black hole ( bh ) occurs , and their penetrating power ( especially for hard x - rays , 210kev ) allows them to carry information from the central engine without being substantially affected by absorption . since detection in the soft band ( 0.52kev ) only could miss obscured agn @xcite , we assembled a dataset including objects detected in either hard or soft x - ray bands .",
    "however , even the deepest of the current x - ray surveys are likely to miss the most heavily obscured `` compton thick '' agn @xcite .      in order to find x - ray emitting bulgeless , we matched the x - ray catalogues described in ",
    "[ sec : xray - data ] with our optical database  including all the morphological types  using an adaptation of the likelihood - ratio method @xcite .",
    "this method assigns to every matching pair a probability of being a _ non - false _ match ; then we chose only the pairs for which the method gave high probability values ( @xmath143 ) , and selected only the bulgeless objects in the redshift range of interest ( @xmath88 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "we also visually inspected the optical images to spot any obvious mis - identification due to a failure of the matching algorithm ( e.g. , because of a nearby very bright source ) .",
    "we excluded from our sample extended x - ray sources , which are usually related to galaxy clusters rather than agn @xcite , and objects which have large cross - band positional offsets ( @xmath144 2.5arcsec , * ? ? ? * ) to obtain a reliable final sample .",
    "the rest - frame x - ray luminosity was calculated using photometric ( or spectroscopic , when available ) redshifts using the formula : @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the luminosity distance in cm , and @xmath147 is the observed full x - ray flux in units of . the photon index , @xmath148 ,",
    "is assumed to be equal to  1.8 for all sources , as the use of individual indices results in only minor differences in the rest - frame luminosities @xcite .",
    "following @xcite the criteria adopted to identify and classify an agn are the following :    * agn-1 : @xmath149ergs@xmath10 and @xmath150 , which show narrow and broad lines in the optical bands ; * agn-2 : @xmath151ergs@xmath10 and @xmath152 , for which only narrow lines are observed in the optical bands .    where hr is the hardness ratio defined as @xmath153 ; @xmath61 is the number of photon counts in the hard band and @xmath154 is the number of counts in the soft band .",
    "the hr can be used to roughly estimate the obscuration affecting the sources , as the most efficient and reddening independent method to select obscured type  2 agn is the presence of luminous x - ray emission and hard x - ray colours .",
    "where a source has only upper limits in the soft or hard bands , the hr is assumed as  + 1 and  -1 , respectively .    though widely used , this method suffers from some uncertainties .",
    "it is worth noting that some high redshift absorbed / type  2 sources can be identified as type  1 when adopting a x - ray classification based on the hr .",
    "in fact , increasing absorption makes the sources harder , while a high redshift makes them softer .",
    "nevertheless , there is evidence that the method is robust as it gives results that are in good agreement with those obtained through optical indicators , such as bpt diagrams ( see for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "this classification yielded  43 agn candidates .    typically , hard x - ray detections with luminosity higher that 10@xmath155ergs@xmath10 are evident tracers of agn activity ; nonetheless , for sources in which only soft x - rays were detected ( 21  in our sample ) , we tested whether the x - ray luminosities could be produced by star - formation activity instead of an agn .",
    "sfrs derived in   [ sec : massive ] for most of the agn candidates give values in the range 450@xmath156yr@xmath10 , with just one outlier showing 167@xmath156yr@xmath10 .",
    "applying the relation @xcite : @xmath157 that holds at @xmath158 , we can conclude that the x - ray luminosities of our sample are one to three orders of magnitude higher than the ones calculated with eq .  .",
    "the morphological classification of the sample extracted from the acs - gc , as described in @xcite and in ",
    "[ sec : morphology ] , relied on galfit results ; the reliability of such a classification was assessed in   [ sec : morph - rel ] , and it proved to be appropriate for statistical purposes .",
    "however , since the agn host candidates represent a very small fraction of our sample , we double checked the morphology of each object with an x - ray counterpart to exclude possible mis - classifications due to the automatic procedure . given that bulgeless agn are extremely rare , any morphological mis - classification would likely be clearly revealed in this sample .    for each target we retrieved a 256@xmath159256  pixel cut - out from the hst / acs archive .",
    "we visually inspected the 43  cut - out images and identified 4  sources which we classified as mergers and rejected from the sample without attempting any further analysis .",
    "one additional source showed an extended dust lane feature and was also discarded .",
    "the morphology of the remaining sources was tested with a detailed analysis of the surface brightness ( sb ) profiles .",

    "we then determined the best fit srsic profiles for each agn host candidate galaxy .",
    "if a single srsic model did not provide an adequate fit to the data , we tried a combination of a srsic plus an exponential disc profile . according to @xcite",
    "late - type galaxies can host _ pseudo - bulges _ in the central regions which are described by low srsic indices ( @xmath160 ) , and have central light distribution similar to that of the outer disc . from this analysis we rejected three candidates showing a bulge component with @xmath161 .",
    "finally , five additional objects were rejected because they had an ambiguous match between the optical and the x - ray source position .",

    "this implies that internal bulge growth through either star - formation activity or mergers , and interactions with nearby companions make massive pure - disc systems evolve to earlier type morphologies through time .",
    "the most massive galaxies among our sample are indeed characterized by sfrs ranging between  10 and  100@xmath156yr@xmath10 , suggesting that a prolongued star - formation activity ( @xmath170yr ) at such rate might contribute to the build - up of nuclear mass and formation of a classical bulge .",
