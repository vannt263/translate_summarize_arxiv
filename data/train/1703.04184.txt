    "the variability hypothesis ( vh ) , also known as the greater male variability hypothesis , asserts that  males are more likely than females to vary from the norm in both physical and mental traits \" @xcite .",
    "the origin of the hypothesis is often traced back to johann meckel in the early eighteenth century , and it was used by charles darwin to help explain extreme male secondary sex characteristics in many species . in the first edition of _ man and woman _",
    "( london , 1894 ) , havelock ellis devoted an entire chapter to the variability hypothesis , and  asserted that both retardation and genius are more frequent among males than females \" @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the vh says nothing about differences in _ means _ between males and females , and even for some physical attributes where the average values are significantly different , such as height , the variance in human males has been found to be significantly greater than that in females ( e.g. , @xcite ) . not surprisingly , all ten of the ten tallest humans are male , but five of the shortest ten humans are also male ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the variability hypothesis proved highly controversial during the last century ( see below ) ; nevertheless , the past fifteen years have seen a resurgence of research on this topic .",
    "although some of these more recent studies found  inconsistent support for the greater male variability hypothesis \" @xcite , and thatgreater male variability with respect to mathematics is not ubiquitous \" @xcite , many more ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have found vh to be valid in different contexts .",
    "for example , arden and plomin  found greater variance  [ in intelligence ] among boys at every age except age two \" @xcite , and machin and pekkarinen found greater male variance in both mathematics and reading among boys and girls in thirty - five of the forty countries that participated in the 2003 programme for international student assessment @xcite .",
    "et al _ found that ",
    "males are more variable on most measures of quantitative and visuospatial ability , which necessarily results in more males at both high- and low - ability extremes \" @xcite , and he _ et al _ reported that the results of their studies in mainland china  supported the hypothesis that boys have greater variability than girls in creativity test performance \" @xcite .",
    "baye and monseur s studies of gender differences in variance and at the extreme tails of the score distribution in reading , mathematics , and science concluded  the greater male variability hypothesis is confirmed \" @xcite , and strand _",
    "et al s _ studies of verbal reasoning , non - verbal reasoning , and quantitative reasoning among boys and girls in the u.k . , reported  for all three tests there were substantial sex differences in the standard deviation of scores , with greater variance among boys ",
    "boys were over represented relative to girls at both the top and the bottom extremes for all tests \" @xcite .",
    "et al _  reviewed the history of the hypothesis that general intelligence is more biologically variable in males than in females   and presented data   which in many ways are the most complete that have ever been compiled , [ that ] substantially support \" the vh @xcite .",
    "even among studies supporting the validity of vh , there has been no clear or compelling explanation offered for _ why _ there might be gender differences in variability .",
    "et al _ report ,  the causes remain unexplained \" @xcite , and halpern _ et al _ concluded  the reasons why males are often more variable remain elusive \" @xcite .",
    "some researchers found that the underlying reason for the vh is probably not due to the educational system ; e.g. , arden and plomin found that  differences in variance emerge early  even before pre - school  suggesting that they are not determined by educational influences \" @xcite .",
    "other researchers specifically mention the possibility of biological factors as a likely underlying explanation for the vh : johnson _ et al _ , after providing data that substantially support the vh in general intelligence , concluded that these differences in variability  possibly have roots in biological differences \" ( among other factors ) @xcite ; and ju _ et al _ , in finding that gender differences in variability in creativity are consistent across urban and rural samples , conjectured that it is  more likely related to biological / evolutionary factors \" @xcite .",
    "our goal here is neither to challenge nor to confirm the vh , but rather to propose a theory based exactly on such biological / evolutionary mechanisms that might help explain how one gender of a species might tend to evolve with greater variability than the other gender .",
    "note that the precise formal definitions and assumptions here are clearly not applicable in real - life scenarios , and that the contribution here is thus also merely a general theory based on unproved and unprovable hypotheses .",
    "this theory is independent of species , and although it may raise red flags for some when applied to _ homo sapiens _ , we share the viewpoints of erikson _ et al _ that the  variability hypothesis is not only of mere historical interest but also has current relevance for clinical practice \" @xcite , and of ju _ et al _ that such a study  enriches the discourse on the greater male variability hypothesis \" @xcite .",
    "strenuous objections have been raised over the years about the implications of vh for certain attributes . shortly after the groundbreaking work of ellis in support of the vh , notable opposition appeared .",
    "psychologist leta hollingworth , the former doctoral student of nationally known and respected educational psychologist e. l. thorndike , himself a prominent advocate of the vh , attacked the vh on several statistical and sociological grounds @xcite , and according to @xcite , was one of the most influential critics of the vh .",
    "the heated debates continued throughout the twentieth century , at the end of which psychologist stefanie shields asserted  for some scientists , the idea that females would be unlikely to excel suggested that it was unnecessary to provide them with opportunities to do so \" and concluded , ",
    "early feminist researchers were largely responsible for its eventual decline \" @xcite .",
    "since then the heated conflicts have continued unabated , in spite of its alleged  eventual decline \" .",
    "one of the most widely reported incidents concerned the remarks that harvard president larry summers made at a national bureau of economic research conference on diversifying the science and engineering workforce in january 2005 .",
    "he prefaced his remarks by saying that he would confine himself to  the issue of women s representation in tenured positions in science and engineering at top universities and research institutions \" and then observed  it does appear that on many , many different human attributes  height , weight , propensity for criminality , overall iq , mathematical ability , scientific ability - there is relatively clear evidence that whatever the difference in means - which can be debated - there is a difference in the standard deviation , and variability of a male and a female population \" @xcite . in other words , summers was simply reminding his audience of the gist of the vh , that for many attributes , males are overrepresented at both the high _ and _ the low ends of the distribution .",
    "his statement caused a firestorm when it was completely misrepresented by both scholars and the press .",
    "yale computer scientist david gelernter , writing in the _ los angeles times _ , stated that summers had  suggested that , on average , maybe women are less good than men at science , which might explain why fewer females than males are science professors at harvard  [ and that ] summers made a statement about averages , not individuals \" @xcite .",
    "these statements were completely false , as science writer dana mackenzie pointed out in the _ swarthmore college bulletin _ , writing ",
    "well , no , he did nt .",
    "but in the public debate , that is how his statement was interpreted \" @xcite .",
    "summers had made no such statement about _ averages _ , but merely had suggested that the _ standard deviation _ for males appeared to be greater than that of females .",
    "that is , the tails of the male distribution curves are heavier at _ both _ ends . not that there are no females in the top echelon , but simply that the relative frequencies of males are greater than those of females , at both ends - in ellis s terms , more retardation , more genius .",
    "the resulting uproar , however , precipitated a no - confidence vote by the harvard faculty , and prompted summers s resignation as president .",
    "an even thornier issue is the question of what , if anything , should be done if there is in fact some validity to the vh . for some venues with objective performance measures ,",
    "the solution is simply to have separate women - only competitions , as is done in the olympics and the world chess championships . in other less clear areas ,",
    "the approach to the problem , if it is indeed a problem , has also raised controversial remedies even among the proponents of the vh .",
    "for example , in 2013 educators he _",
    "et al _ suggested that ",
    "separate distribution curves and norms should be developed for boys and girls , and different cut - off points should be used for identifying and selecting students for special or gifted programs .",
    "\" there seems to be no end to the controversies , and the authors leave the socio - political debates to others .",
    "the basic idea in this article is very simple . + selectivity theory : _ in a population with two sexes a and b , both of which are needed for reproduction , suppose that sex a is relatively * selective * , i.e. , will mate only with a top tier ( less than half ) of b candidates . then among subpopulations of b with comparable average attributes , those with * greater variability * will tend to prevail over those with lesser variability .",
    "conversely , if a is relatively * non - selective * , accepting all but a bottom fraction ( less than half ) of the opposite sex , subpopulations of b with * lesser variability * will tend to prevail over those with comparable means and greater variability .",
    "_   +    note that this theory makes no assumptions about differences in means between the sexes , nor does it presume that one sex is selective and the other non - selective . if both sexes happen to be selective , for instance , then the best evolutionary strategy for each is to tend to greater variability .",
    "the next example illustrates the underlying ideas of this selectivity theory of gender differences in variability through an elementary hypothetical scenario where the subpopulations have distinct fitness levels , and one is trivially more variable than the other .",
    "the two subsequent sections provide detailed models with perhaps more realistic assumptions of fitness levels distributed normally or exponentially ; the first uses a probabilistic analysis and the second a standard system of coupled ordinary differential equations as are common in population studies .    to quantify  acceptability \" by the opposite sex , it will be assumed here and throughout that each individual in each sex has a real number that reflects its attractiveness to the opposite sex , with a larger number being preferable to a smaller one .",
    "biologists often use the word _ fitness _ for this concept , and in some sense this numerical value describes how good its particular genotype is at leaving offspring .",
    "fitness is a relative thing , and in this simplified model , this single number represents an individual s level of reproductive success relative to some baseline level @xcite .",
    "[ ex2.3 ] sex @xmath0 consists of two subpopulations @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "half of the fitness values of @xmath1 are uniformly distributed between 1 and 2 and the other half are uniformly distributed between 3 and 4 , while all of the fitness values of @xmath2 are uniformly distributed between 2 and 3 . thus @xmath1 is more variable than @xmath2 , and they both have the same average fitness .",
    "suppose first that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are of equal size .",
    "then one quarter of sex @xmath0 ( the lower half of @xmath1 ) has fitness values between 1 and 2 , half of @xmath0 ( all of @xmath2 ) has fitness between 2 and 3 , and one quarter of @xmath0 ( the upper half of @xmath1 ) has values between 3 and 4",
    ". if sex @xmath3 is relatively selective and will mate only with the top quarter of sex @xmath0 , then all of the next generation will be offspring of the more variable subpopulation @xmath1 . on the other hand , if sex @xmath3 is relatively non - selective and will mate with any but the lower quarter of @xmath0 , then all of the less variable @xmath2 will mate , but only half of the more variable @xmath1 will mate .    similar conclusions follow if the initial subpopulations are not of equal size . for example , suppose that one third of sex @xmath0 is the more variable @xmath1 and two thirds is the less variable @xmath2 .",
    "then if sex @xmath3 only mates with the top quarter of @xmath0 , a short calculation shows that two thirds of the next generation will be offspring of @xmath1 and one third will be offspring of @xmath2 , thereby reversing their proportions toward the more variable subpopulation .",
    "if sex @xmath3 will mate with any but the lower quarter of @xmath0 , then only two ninths of the next generation will be offspring of @xmath1 and seven ninths will be offsprings of @xmath2 , thereby increasing the proportion of the less variable subpopulation of sex @xmath0 .",
    "note the asymmetry here in the mating probabilities ; some intuition behind why this occurs may perhaps be gained from the observation that the upper tier of the more variable population will always be able to mate , whether the opposite sex is selective or non - selective .    to facilitate more mathematically precise notions of these fitness and selectivity ideas , several definitions and notation will be introduced .",
    "the fitness of individuals within sexes varies , and its ( normalized ) distribution is a probability distribution .",
    "a key characteristic of the distribution is the proportion of individuals whose fitness exceeds each given threshold . to fix notation using standard statistical terminology , for a ( borel ) probability measure @xmath4 on the real line @xmath5 , let @xmath6 denote the _ survival function _ for @xmath4 ( i.e.",

    "next , the notion of one distribution being more ( or less ) variable than another will be specified .",
    "there are many possibilities for such a definition , for instance via standard deviations or first absolute central moments , but those can be quite misleading in the vh context for many distributions .",
    "on the other hand , basic comparisons of the survival functions of the two distributions leads to a natural , albeit somewhat restrictive , notion of greater variability .",

    "note that this definition does not require finite standard deviations or symmetry of the two distributions , although the examples provided below have both .",
    "similar conclusions may be drawn about one - sided variability , and this is left to the interested reader .",
    "some assumption on the two distributions ( of the same sex ) having comparable average attributes is clearly necessary to be able to draw any useful conclusions in the selectivity context ; the assumption of identical medians used here is one natural candidate .",

    "now again consider a species with two sexes , @xmath3 and @xmath0 ( both of which are needed for reproduction ) , with value functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 representing the _ intrinsic fitness values _ that each sex places on individuals of the opposite sex .",

    "thus , if this selectivity theory has validity , gender differences in variability are time dependent whenever the two sexes tendencies in selectivity are evolving .",
    "if gender differences in selectivity have been decreasing and are now less significant in humans than they were in prehistoric times , as appears might be the case , this theory would also predict that the gender difference in variability has also been decreasing in modern times , i.e. , the vh has been slowly disappearing . whether or not that is the case , of course , is far beyond the scope of this article , and is a possible topic for future research .",

    "<S> a selectivity theory is proposed to help explain how one gender of a species might tend to evolve with greater variability than the other gender . briefly </S>",
    "<S> , the theory says that if one sex is relatively selective , then more variable subpopulations of the opposite sex will tend to prevail over those with lesser variability ; and conversely , if one sex is relatively non - selective , then less variable subpopulations of the opposite sex will tend to prevail over those with greater variability . </S>",
    "<S> this theory makes no assumptions about differences in means between the sexes , nor does it presume that one sex is selective and the other non - selective . </S>",
    "<S> two mathematical models are presented : a statistical analysis using normally distributed fitness values , and a deterministic analysis using a standard system of coupled ordinary differential equations with exponentially distributed fitness levels . the theory is applied to the classical greater male variability hypothesis . </S>"
