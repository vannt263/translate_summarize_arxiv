    "one - dimensional diffusive capture processes have rich properties that have inspired much research in the applied probability  @xcite and statistical physics communities  @xcite .",
    "one example of this genre is the `` lamb - lion '' problem  @xcite , in which a lamb diffuses on the infinite line in the presence of @xmath7 independently diffusing lions that initially are all to one side of the lamb .",
    "whenever a lamb and lion meet , the lamb is killed .",
    "asymptotically , the survival probability of the lamb due to these @xmath7 lions decays as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 depends non - trivially on the number of lions  @xcite and secondarily on the diffusivities of the lamb and the lion , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .    when @xmath12 , the qualitative dependence of @xmath9 is understood , even though the exact value of @xmath9 is unknown for @xmath13 . for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , as this case can be mapped to the probability that a single random walker  corresponding to the lamb - lion separation  does not hit the origin by time @xmath5  @xcite . for @xmath16 , @xmath17  @xcite",
    "; that is , two lions are less effective in killing the lamb than what might be expected because of their ostensible independence .",
    "the resolution of this apparently contradictory behavior is that whenever the lamb moves , the lions move in unison with respect to the reference frame of the lamb .",
    "this induced correlation between the lions implies that the effective number of lions is less than 2 .",
    "this three - body problem may be exactly solved by mapping it to the diffusion of a single effective particle in an absorbing two - dimensional wedge of opening angle @xmath18 ( and generally the opening angle is a function of @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) whose solution recovers @xmath19  @xcite ; moreover , @xmath20 is readily computable for arbitrary @xmath10 and @xmath11  @xcite .    for @xmath13 ,",
    "simulations give @xmath21  @xcite , @xmath22 , and @xmath23  @xcite , but an analytical solution for @xmath13 is not yet known . while the @xmath7-lion problem can be readily mapped onto the diffusion of an effective particle in @xmath24 dimensions that is restricted to an absorbing wedge region defined by @xmath7 constraint hyperplanes  the so - called weyl chamber  @xcite  the solution to this simply - stated problem seems to be difficult to achieve .",
    "a simplification arises in the limit @xmath25 , however , where one can map the problem to the diffusion of an effective particle in the presence of an absorbing and approaching boundary whose position scales as @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "this approach gives @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "with respect to the man , while the man becomes progressively more sluggish and eventually comes to rest.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    inspired by this lamb - lion system and also motivated by the unusual phenomenology of locally activated random walks  @xcite , we introduce the `` man - mosquitoes '' model ( fig .  [ model ] ) , in which independent `` mosquitoes '' , each with fixed diffusivity @xmath1 , repeatedly bite the man that has an evolving diffusivity @xmath0 .",
    "after each mosquito bite , the diffusivity of the man is reduced by a fixed amount @xmath31 , while the diffusivity of each mosquito is unchanged . to avoid spurious singularities",
    ", the mosquito immediately moves equiprobably either a distance @xmath32 or @xmath33 from the man after each encounter .",
    "thus after each mosquito bite , the encounter process begins anew , but with the diffusivity of the man reduced by @xmath31 . for convenience ,",
    "we define the initial diffusivity of the man @xmath0 to be an integer multiple of @xmath31 , that is , @xmath34 .",
    "thus after being bitten @xmath35 times , the man is at rest , which we define as being `` dead '' .",
    "our goal is to determine the distribution of times and distances traveled after each encounter with the mosquitoes and the position and time elapsed when the man dies .",
    "here we treat the simplest , but still non - trivial , case of a single mosquito .",
    "initially , the man is at @xmath36 and the mosquito is equiprobably at either @xmath37 or @xmath38 , where @xmath39 can be viewed as the lattice spacing in a discrete random - walk formulation . the basic ingredient to understand how the man moves",
    "is determined by the statistical properties of the first encounter between the man and mosquito when they have arbitrary diffusivities and start a distance @xmath39 apart .",
    "the full problem involves convolving @xmath40 of these first encounters . to solve for a single first encounter , we map the one - dimensional motions of the two particles onto the motion of a single effective particle in two dimensions , whose coordinates are the positions of the man and the mosquito , and then apply the image method to solve this effective problem ( sec .",
    "[ single ] ) . in section  [ multiple ]",
    ", we apply these single - encounter results to determine the dynamics of multiple encounters . by this approach",
    ", we thereby determine the probability distributions of displacements and lifetimes of the man at the moment when he dies .",
    "we provide a brief discussion and outline several extensions of this work in sec .",
    "[ outlook ] .",
    "as a preliminary , we review the first - passage properties of an isotropically diffusing particle in two dimensions that is initially located at @xmath41 , diffuses in the half space @xmath42 , and is absorbed when it hits any point @xmath3 along the locus @xmath43  @xcite . this absorption is characterized by : ( i ) the first - passage probability , namely , the probability that the particle first hits a point @xmath44 on the absorbing line at time @xmath5 , and ( ii ) the eventual hitting probability , the probability that particle is eventually absorbed at @xmath44 .",
    "the probability density of the particle , @xmath45 , obeys the diffusion equation , @xmath46 , subject to the absorbing boundary condition @xmath47 and the initial condition @xmath48 . by the image method ,",
    "the solution is a sum of a gaussian centered at @xmath49 and an anti - gaussian centered at the image point @xmath50 : @xmath51/4dt } -    e^{-[x^2+(y+a)^2]/4dt } \\right\\}\\,.\\ ] ] from this expression , the first - passage probability to the point @xmath52 is @xmath53 notice that while the flux , @xmath54 , is in the @xmath55 direction , the first - passage probability is positive .",
    "integrating this first - passage probability over all time gives the eventually hitting probability to a point @xmath44 on the @xmath3-axis . using the variable substitution @xmath56 , this integration becomes elementary and the result is the cauchy , or lorenztian , distribution : @xmath57 the absolute value sign makes this result valid for @xmath58 and @xmath59 . because of this power - law decay , the mean - square position of the particle when it hits the absorbing line is infinite .",
    "parenthetically , the probability that the particle first hits _ any _ point on the @xmath3-axis at time @xmath5 is simply the classic one - dimensional first - passage probability @xmath60 for which the mean first - hitting time is divergent .",
    "we now study the case of a man with diffusivity @xmath0 and mosquito with diffusivity @xmath1 that are initially at @xmath36 and @xmath61 , respectively ; later we will average over the cases where initially @xmath61 and @xmath62 . to determine the probability that the man and mosquito first meet at position @xmath3 at time @xmath5 when starting from this initial state , we map this two - particle system to an effective single - particle problem in the two - dimensional coordinates @xmath63 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of the effective particle is anisotropic , since typically @xmath64 . to simplify matters",
    ", we rescale the effective particle coordinates to @xmath65 and @xmath66 so that the effective particle diffuses isotropically with unit diffusivity .",
    "the condition that the mosquito meets the man , @xmath67 , translates to @xmath68 .",
    "thus the effective particle starts at @xmath69 $ ] , moves with unit diffusivity , and eventually hits the line @xmath68 that is inclined at an angle @xmath70 with respect to the horizontal ( fig .",
    "[ plane ] ) .    .",
    "a first - passage trajectory is shown.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    to analyze this problem , it is convenient to introduce the rotated coordinates @xmath71 defined by @xmath72 because the mosquito meeting the man corresponds to the effective particle hitting a point on the locus @xmath73 . in these rotated coordinates ,",
    "the initial condition becomes @xmath74 following eq .",
    ", the probability density of the effective particle in the @xmath75-plane is again the sum of a gaussian and an anti - gaussian : @xmath76/4 t } -   e^{-[(z_m-\\xi)^2 + ( z_m+\\eta)^2]/4 t } \\right\\}\\,.\\ ] ] from this expression , the first - passage probability to a point @xmath77 on the @xmath73 axis is @xmath78/4t}\\,,\\ ] ] while the eventually hitting probability to this point , the time integral of , is @xmath79 where the absolute value sign accounts for the possibility that the mosquito could initially be on either side of the man .    to appreciate the meaning of these results , we need to transform the above expressions for @xmath80 and @xmath81 to the original coordinates . for the eventual hitting probability @xmath80 , the peak in this quantity occurs when @xmath82 . from fig .",
    "[ plane ] , this condition translates to @xmath83\\,,\\ ] ] which we recast , after some simple algebra , as @xmath84 as expected , if the mosquito diffuses quickly , the man will have barely moved when he is bitten .",
    "conversely , if the mosquito diffuses slowly , the man will be close to the initial position of the mosquito when the bite occurs .",
    "we now use @xmath85 to transform to the original @xmath86 coordinates to give :    [ es ] @xmath87 for the probability that the man has moved a distance @xmath3 when he is first bitten by the mosquito . using @xmath88 , we can equivalently rewrite @xmath89 in terms of the diffusivities only : @xmath90 ^ 2 + \\left[a\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{d_md_m}}{(d_m+d_m)}\\right]^2\\right\\}^{-1}~,\\ ] ]    this expression holds for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and we should average over these two cases to account for the possibilities that the mosquito is initially to the right or to the left of the man .",
    "thus the probability distribution of displacements after a single encounter with the mosquito again has the long - range cauchy form first given in . similarly , eq .",
    "can be transformed back to the original variables , to give the probability @xmath91 that the man has moved a distance @xmath3 when he meets the mosquito at time @xmath5 : @xmath92 integrating this last expression over all positions , the distribution of times when the man first encounters the mosquito is @xmath93}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result is well known and is easily obtained from eq .",
    "because if one is concerned only with the meeting time , one only needs the separation between the man and mosquito , and this variable diffuses with diffusion coefficient @xmath94 .",
    "we now compute the probability that the man has moved a distance @xmath3 at the moment when he dies , which occurs when the man has been bitten @xmath40 times . as a preliminary ,",
    "the fourier transform of the cauchy step - length distribution at the @xmath95 encounter with the mosquito ( with @xmath96 ) is : @xmath97 here @xmath98 as given in .",
    "here @xmath99 is a random variable that assumes the values @xmath100 or @xmath101 , respectively , if the mosquito is displaced by @xmath32 or @xmath33 after the @xmath95 meeting with the man ; these two events occur with probability @xmath102 . additionally , all relevant variables are now indexed by @xmath103 , the number of man - mosquito encounters . for a given realization of @xmath104 ,",
    "the probability distribution of displacements of the man at the @xmath105 encounter with the mosquito equals the product of the fourier transforms of single - encounter displacement distributions : @xmath106\\,.\\ ] ] inverting this expression ( see eq .  ) , the probability distribution at the moment when the man and mosquito have met @xmath40 times , and for a given realization @xmath104 , is @xmath107    for the specific case where initially @xmath108 and the diffusivity of the man decreases by @xmath109 each time the mosquito bites the man , then @xmath110 and the man dies after @xmath40 bites . for this choice @xmath111 to estimate the average of the probability distribution over all realizations of @xmath112 , we need @xmath113 and @xmath114 . because @xmath115 and @xmath116 are slowly varying functions of @xmath75 , the leading behaviors of these sums are @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , where @xmath119 are of the order of one",
    ". thus the probability distribution of displacements of the man when he dies is again the cauchy distribution @xmath120 thus , while the typical distance that the man moves before he dies is of the order of @xmath40 , the long tail of this distribution leads to the average distance traveled being infinite . in this result",
    ", the displacement of the mosquito by @xmath2 after each bite contributes only to the subdominant term @xmath121 in @xmath122 and therefore is asymptotically irrelevant .",
    "following this same approach , we may also compute the probability @xmath123 that the man dies at time @xmath5 ( which occurs after @xmath40 mosquito bites ) .",
    "this probability is the convolution of the single - encounter first - passage probabilities  . for this convolution",
    ", we first need the laplace transform of eq .  .",
    "this is given by @xmath124}\\,e^{-st } dt\\,,\\nonumber \\\\ & = \\phantom{\\frac{1}{2}}e^{-|a|\\sqrt{s/(d_m+d_m)}}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath40 encounters with the mosquito , the laplace transform is given by @xmath125 where we have used @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "we now write the product as the exponential of the sum and replace the sum by an integral .",
    "the resulting integral is elementary and the result is @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "inverting this laplace transform gives the distribution of times when the man dies , which happens after @xmath40 encounters with the mosquito : @xmath130 for large times , this first - passage probability at the moment of death decays as @xmath131 .",
    "the mean time to die is infinite , as is the case for a single man - mosquito encounter .",
    "however , as @xmath40 increases , corresponding to each mosquito bite being less damaging , the amplitude of the asymptotic distribution increases linearly with @xmath40 .",
    "we introduced a diffusive capture process in which each interaction between a prey and a predator causes the diffusivity of the prey to decrease by a fixed amount . after a finite number of interactions of this type",
    ", the prey eventually comes to rest , which we define as its death . as in the conventionally - studied case where the predator kills the prey when they first meet ,",
    "basic questions about this capture process are the survival probability of the prey and the properties of its motion during the chase .    in this work",
    ", we investigated the simple case of a single predator , for which the above long - time properties of the prey can be obtained from classic first - passage concepts .",
    "specifically , we determined the distribution of displacements when the prey dies . between each encounter with the mosquito ,",
    "the displacement distribution is given by the long - ranged cauchy distribution .",
    "thus the displacement distribution when the man dies  which is a convolution of single - encounter distributions  also has a cauchy form that is given by eq .  .",
    "thus even though the prey is continuously hunted by the predator and its health  quantified by its diffusivity  is progressively declining , the prey can , on average , endure to wander over a wide range .",
    "there are a number of natural directions for further work .",
    "the most immediate is the case of @xmath132 mosquitoes , where the man has to escape a cloud of mosquitoes rather than just a single mosquito .",
    "the special case of @xmath16 mosquitoes should be amenable to an asymptotic solution because the dynamics of this three - particle system after each mosquito bite is , in principle , known .",
    "when the mosquitoes and the man initially have the same diffusivities , the probability that the first bite occurs at time @xmath5 or greater decays as @xmath133 , for the initial ordering @xmath134 ( @xmath135 , @xmath136 ) , and as @xmath6 , for the initial ordering @xmath137 .",
    "( note that the relative ordering of the man and the mosquito is important only in one dimension . )   after many mosquito bites , the corresponding exponents for these same orderings are  @xcite : @xmath138^{-1}\\sim 1 -\\frac{d_m}{\\pi }   \\qquad d_m\\to 0\\,,\\\\ & \\beta_{\\rm mmm}= \\pi\\left[{2\\cos^{-1}\\bigg(\\frac{d_m}{1+d_m}\\bigg)}\\right]^{-1}\\hskip 0.6 cm \\sim 1+d_m\\qquad d_m\\to 0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus as the man is repeatedly bitten and becomes more sluggish , his survival probability decays with an exponent that approaches one as @xmath139 , independent of the relative positions of the man and the mosquitoes .",
    "the effect of this exponent approaching 1 is that that the average lifetime of the man is infinite , even if he is initially surrounded by the mosquitoes , a configuration that would lead to a finite lifetime when a single mosquito bite is fatal .    for larger @xmath7",
    ", the basic question is to determine the dependence of the lifetime of the man as a function of @xmath7 and the initial diffusivities of the man and the mosquitoes . in general , when a single mosquito bite is fatal , the mean lifetime of the man is finite ( the only exceptions are the cases of @xmath14 , as well as @xmath16 and @xmath140 , with all the mosquitoes initially to one side of the man )",
    ". it will be worthwhile to determine the dependence of the lifetime on @xmath7 and on the virulence of the mosquitoes , as quantified by @xmath31 , the decrease in the diffusivity of the man after each bite .",
    "what is an open question is the nature of the dependence of the man s lifetime on basic parameters in two dimensions or greater .",
    "the approach developed here can , in principle , be extended to compute the joint distribution that the man has traveled a distance @xmath3 and has lived for a time @xmath5 when he dies .",
    "starting with the joint probability that the man has traveled a distance @xmath3 over a time @xmath5 when an encounter occurs , the corresponding distribution after @xmath40 encounters with the mosquito is the convolution of these single - encounter joint probabilities .",
    "the calculation of these convolutions is conceptually straightforward by making use of the laplace - fourier transform technique .",
