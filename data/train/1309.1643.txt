    "<S> in this talk the methods and computer tools which were used in our recent calculation of the three - loop standard model renormalization group coefficients are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> a brief review of the techniques based on special features of dimensional regularization and minimal subtraction schemes is given . </S>",
    "<S> our treatment of @xmath0 is presented in some details . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for a reasonable set of initial parameters the numerical estimates of the obtained three - loop contributions are presented .    </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization group ( rg ) proves to be a useful and powerful tool in studying high - energy behavior of the standard model . before the discovery of the higgs boson rg equations ( rge ) were used , among other things , to bound the value of the higgs self - coupling . </S>",
    "<S> however , the bounds significantly depends on the scale at which one expects the appearance of new physics . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of the higgs boson in 2012 @xcite in some sense finalizes the sm since the information about the values of all the sm couplings become available from experiments .    due to this fact </S>",
    "<S> , the interest to rg studies of the standard model arises again , but at a new level of precision . </S>",
    "<S> one- and two - loop results for sm beta - functions have been known for quite a long time   @xcite and are summarized in  @xcite .    the first paper with full three - loop calculation of gauge coupling beta - functions within the sm was published in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the next step was carried out by another group from karlsruhe @xcite , which considered , in the specific limit , the three - loop beta - functions for the top quark yukawa coupling , the higgs self - coupling and mass parameter . at this state of things </S>",
    "<S> our group entered the game . </S>",
    "<S> we not only confirmed the results of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite but also provided the three - loop expressions for beta - functions of all the yukawa couplings @xcite corresponding to the fermions of third generation . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to chetyrkin and zoller , we include the dependence on electroweak couplings .    in the beginning of 2013 </S>",
    "<S> our group started the calculation of missing three - loop terms in beta - functions of the higgs potential parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the same problem was considered by the authors from karlsruhe . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately to us , they managed to obtain and make their results @xcite public a week earlier than our group @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in such a complicated calculation it is important to have a confirmation from an independent source . in what follows , we are going to discuss the peculiarities of the procedure used to obtain the results published by our group in a series of papers @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> first of all , let us mention that the calculation of the three - loop sm beta - functions requires evaluation of millions of feynman diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> this task definitely requires automatization by means of a computer . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , all the necessary tools were available on the market , so we only needed to combine them in a proper way .    </S>",
    "<S> it is due to nice features of dimensional regularization and minimal subtraction scheme so one can significantly simplify the calculation . since in @xmath1-scheme all the renormalization constants can be extracted from the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergent parts of corresponding green functions , one can modify infra - red ( ir ) structure of the model to simplify the calculation of counter - terms . </S>",
    "<S> this is the essence of the so - called infrared - rearrangement ( irr ) trick , which was originally proposed by vladimirov a.a  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of modifications can lead to a spurious ir divergences which should be removed consistently by the so - called @xmath2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in many practical cases one can avoid this kind of complications . </S>",
    "<S> in our series of paper we made use of two variants of ( naive ) irr procedure .    </S>",
    "<S> for the calculation of gauge and yukawa coupling beta - functions it is possible to convert all the required two- and three- point green functions to the massless propagator - type feynman integrals . </S>",
    "<S> it is done via neglecting all internal masses and setting the higgs boson external momenta entering yukawa vertex to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the evaluation of massless three - loop propagators is performed via a form @xcite package ` mincer `  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of manipulations does not introduce spurious ir divergences . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since we are only interesting in uv counter - terms it is possible to work from the very beginning within the  unbroken phase  of the sm , in which all the fields are massless and the higgs doublet @xmath3 does not have a vacuum expectation value .    </S>",
    "<S> the second approach to irr , which was used in calculation of higgs potential parameter beta - functions , is the introduction of an auxiliary mass parameter @xmath4 in every propagator via iterative application of the following formula @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are linear combinations of internal and external momenta correspondingly . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that if one applies this kind of decomposition a sufficient number of times the last term can be neglected in the calculation of uv divergences ( after subtraction of subdivergences ) . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that for the scalar four - point green functions considered only the first term in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we are left with massive vacuum integrals , which can be calculated by either public ` matad ` package @xcite or private ` babma ` code written by velizhanin . in such an approach </S>",
    "<S> no spurious ir divergences appear so it can be used in the situations when a naive application of the first variant of irr fails . however , the price to pay for this advantage is the necessity of explicit calculation of diagrams with counter - term insertions . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that one needs to introduce counter - terms for divergences contributing to the auxiliary masses for vector and scalar bosons . for further details </S>",
    "<S> see  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that we can still exploit the symmetries of the unbroken sm . </S>",
    "<S> for example , all the components of the higgs boson doublet should have the same auxiliary mass counter - term . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for the su(2 ) gauge bosons .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as it is stated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the auxiliary mass appearing in the numerator in rhs of eq .   can be safely neglected since it can only contribute to the unphysical mass counter - terms . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one can also skip feynman diagrams with vacuum subdiagrams . in spite of the fact that these subdiagrams are non - zero when the auxiliary mass is introduced , they still can be neglected due to the same reasons .    as it was noticed above </S>",
    "<S> there are a lot of diagrams which should be generated and evaluated in order to find three - loop contributions to the considered quantities . in our calculation </S>",
    "<S> we made use of two popular codes , ` feynarts`@xcite and ` diana ` @xcite/`qgraf ` @xcite , which generate necessary diagrams and produce corresponding analytic expressions . </S>",
    "<S> both packages require a model file prepared in a special format to do their job . since we were wanting to simplify the calculation as much as possible we prepared a model file for the unbroken sm in the background field gauge ( bfg ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of gauge allows one to find gauge coupling beta - functions solely from uv - divergences of corresponding gauge field propagators . </S>",
    "<S> we used a very fast ` lanhep ` code @xcite by a. semenov to derive all the sm vertices from the considered sm lagrangian ( see .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) in ` feynarts ` notation . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that the karlsruhe group made use of alternative package ` feynrules ` @xcite to solve similar problem . </S>",
    "<S> latter on a simple script was written to convert the ` feynarts ` model file to that of ` diana ` .    </S>",
    "<S> a typical problem which arises in this kind of calculation is internal momenta identification . in order to evaluate a feynman diagram one needs to use the momenta notation of the chosen code ( ` mincer`/`matad`/`bamba ` ) . in the case of gauge and </S>",
    "<S> yukawa couplings the problem was solved with the help of routine , ` mapmincer ` , which associate with every ` feynarts ` topology the corresponding ` mincer ` topology and distribute ` mincer ` momenta accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that ` mapmincer ` can deal with three - point vertices with one external leg carrying zero momentum ( i.e. , when internal lines have dots ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding routine for ` diana`/`qgraf ` , ` mapdiana ` , performs similar task , but maps every generated topology to fully massive vacuum integrals , which appear after the mentioned``exact '' decomposition of internal propagators .    given a model file for ` feynarts`/`diana ` together with the correct mapping of internal momenta to the notation of the utilized three - loop codes </S>",
    "<S> it is tenuous but straightforward to generate and calculate one- , two- , and three - loop contributions to the 1pi green - functions presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> for the su(3 ) color algebra the ` color `  @xcite package was used .    </S>",
    "<S> the green functions , considered in the beta - function calculations , together with the corresponding renormalization constants . </S>",
    "<S> left- and right - handed fermions , denoted by @xmath8 , renormalise differently in the sm . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for background @xmath9 and quantum @xmath10 gauge fields in bfg employed . </S>",
    "<S> the su(2 ) invariance implies the presented equalities , which serve as an additional cross - check . ]    from two - point green functions we extract the corresponding wave function renormalization constants in the @xmath1-scheme . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth pointing that the self - energies of both background and quantum gauge fields are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization constants of the former , @xmath11 , are directly connected to that of gauge couplings and the renormalization of the latter corresponds to the z - factors of three gauge - fixing parameters , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , which we keep non - zero during the whole stage of calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the independence of the final results on these parameters serves as an important cross - check of the obtained expressions .    </S>",
    "<S> the three - point 1pi functions for the yukawa vertices with neutral higgs bosons @xmath15 and @xmath16 are also presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that our calculation explicitly demonstrated that the semi - naive treatment of @xmath0 discussed below is only applicable if one takes into account the gauge anomaly cancellation condition @xmath17 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 denotes the number of colors .    </S>",
    "<S> the beta - functions of the sm parameters are extracted from the corresponding renormalization constants . for the gauge and yukawa couplings we used the following relations @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 are su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge couplings correspondingly </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath22 denotes the strong coupling , and @xmath23 is the yukawa coupling associated with the ( right - handed ) fermion @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> both neutral components , @xmath25 , gave the same result , and , thus , provided us with a confirmation of the validity of the obtained expressions . </S>",
    "<S> for the higgs self - coupling it is impossible to use ` mincer ` naively , so feynman diagrams for the four - point functions ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] ) converted to the fully massive vacuum integrals were calculated with the help of private code ` bamba ` ( by velizhanin , who considered the @xmath26 vertex ) and public package ` matad ` ( by bednyakov and pikelner who considered the fully symmetric @xmath27 vertex ) . </S>",
    "<S> these two independent evaluations lead to the same final expression for the vertex renormalization constants , i.e. , confirming the su(2 ) relation @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> a comment is in order on the higgs mass parameter @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to obtain the corresponding anomalous dimension by considering the renormalization of the @xmath30 composite operator within the unbroken(=massless ) sm ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of result can be found at almost no cost from the calculation of @xmath26 vertex . </S>",
    "<S> it is sufficient to select the diagrams , which have @xmath31 and @xmath32 external fields connected to the same four - point vertex ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] ) , and weight different contributions with a correct combinatorial factor . </S>",
    "<S> this restricted set of diagrams give rise to the @xmath33}$ ] renormalization constant .    </S>",
    "<S> the restricted set of feynman diagrams which is used to obtain the renormalization constant @xmath33}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the diagrams of the first type have to be multiplied by @xmath34 . ]    at the end of the day , the renormalization constants for @xmath35 and @xmath29 are obtained with the help of the following relations @xmath36}}{z_{h } }      \\label{eq : lambda_mass_rc}\\ ] ]    from renormalization constants @xmath37 for the dimensionless sm parameters , @xmath38 it is straightforward to obtain the corresponding beta - functions @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the @xmath1  renormalization scale , @xmath41 is the parameter of dimensional regularization , and @xmath42 denotes the coefficient for the single pole in @xmath43 in the expression for @xmath37 , which enters the relation between the bare parameters @xmath44 and the renormalized ones .    </S>",
    "<S> for the anomalous dimension of the higgs mass parameter @xmath29 one can use similar formulae @xmath45 the full analytical results for the considered quantities can be found in ancillary files of the arxiv versions of our papers . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate expressions , e.g. , all the renormalization constants , can also be obtained , if needed , from the authors . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that the beta - functions of all the fundamental sm parameters are free from gauge  parameter dependence , which is a crucial test for our calculation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the anomalous dimension of the higgs doublet can be of some interest , so we also include the corresponding expression in the ancillary files of ref .  @xcite .    before going to the results we would like to stop on the problem related to the definition of the @xmath0 matrix withing the dimensional regularization . </S>",
    "<S> it is known from the literature ( see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and recent explicit calculation  @xcite ) that the traces with an odd number of @xmath0 appearing for the first time in the three - loop diagrams require special treatment . </S>",
    "<S> we closely follow the semi - naive approach presented in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we anticommute @xmath0 to the rightmost position in a fermion chain and use @xmath46 . in the `` even '' traces all @xmath0 are contracted with each other , so the corresponding expressions can be treated naively in dimensional regularization . in `` odd '' traces </S>",
    "<S> we are left with only one @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these traces are evaluated as in four dimensions and produce totally antisymmetric tensors via the relation @xmath47 with @xmath48 .    due to the fact that we use both the @xmath0 anticommutativity and the four - dimensional relation , the cyclicity of the trace </S>",
    "<S> should be relinquished @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one has to choose a certain `` reading prescription '' for an `` odd '' dirac trace , i.e. , start reading a closed fermion chain from a proper place , in order to achieve the correct final result . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our calculations the problem of @xmath0 positioning within the `` odd '' traces is solved implicitly since the diagram generation routines split the traces for us at certain points . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that a non - trivial contribution to the considered quantities can only appear when there are two `` odd '' traces in a diagram , since two @xmath43-tensors should be `` contracted '' with each outher to produce a non - zero effect . </S>",
    "<S> we can distinguish two situations . </S>",
    "<S> two `` odd '' traces in our three - loop calculations can appear either as two internal fermion loops in a diagram with external bosons or , if one considers green functions with two external fermions , one dirac trace from internal fermion loop can be combined with the trace appearing after contraction with an appropriate projector .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to convince oneself that in the case of two internal traces only triangle subloops with three external vector particles can potentially produce `` eps''-tensors . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is known that in the sm these kind of traces cancel upon summation over all the fermion species due to the absence of gauge anomalies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true if one considers fermion self - energies up to three - loops .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns our that the non - trivial contribution due to the contraction of two @xmath49-tensor appears from the yukawa vertex ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of diagrams was also considered in @xcite .     the diagrams for the fermion - fermion - higgs vertex ( @xmath50 ) , which produce a non - zero contribution due to contraction of two @xmath49-tensors appearing from two dirac traces with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the ambiguity in positioning of @xmath0 within the traces does not affect the uv - divergent part . ]    a final remark about @xmath0 is again related to the fact that the ambiguity in the choice of `` reading '' point in the `` odd '' traces can only spoil our result for the three - loop uv - divergence in the case of the mentioned triangle subgraphs , for which one can set all the `` odd '' traces to zero from the very beginning . for the only non - trivial case all the `` reading '' points are equivalent since the difference gives the contribution @xmath51 which we neglect here .     the scale dependence of the relative contributions of different terms in the three - loop corrections to the beta - functions of the ( squared ) gauge and yukawa couplings </S>",
    "<S> . only the most sizable corrections are shown . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary conditions at scale @xmath52  gev are given in . ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious , that the resulting expression for the three - loop contributions to the considered renormalization group quantities are too lengthy to be presented here . for the demonstration purposes only </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to show how different relative contributions to the three - loop corrections to the sm coupling beta - functions evolve with renormalization scale @xmath40 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] ) . for a reasonable choice of the sm initial running parameters at the scale @xmath52 gev @xmath53 we solve the corresponding rge numerically up @xmath54 gev . with the help of these solutions one can evaluate the three - loop beta - functions at any scale and </S>",
    "<S> find how different terms contribute to to the total value of @xmath55 . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] one can see that the dominant contributions is due to the strong and top yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> however , with the increase of the renormalization scale the su(2 ) coupling can also play a role .    </S>",
    "<S> it is fair to say that the most interesting sm beta - function is that of the higgs self - coupling , since from the evolution of the latter one can deduce the so - called `` vacuum stability bound ''  ( see recent papers  @xcite and references therein ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:5 ] one can find the same evolution of the relative contributions to @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the slice @xmath57 of the phase space @xmath58 is presented together with trajectories , obtained with the help of one- , two- , and three - loop evolution from 100 gev to @xmath54 gev . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that for the given set of initial conditions the running @xmath59 is driven to zero faster when one - loop rges are employed instead of two- or three - loop ones . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between two- and three - loop evolution is not sizable , but the fact that with three - loop corrections the scale at which @xmath35 hits zero slightly higher , favours the latter .    [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     to conclude , we obtained the three - loop beta - functions for the sm parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the results for gauge and higgs - potential couplings coincide with that obtained by two karlsruhe groups . </S>",
    "<S> the beta - functions for yukawa couplings were obtained for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we established a framework that allow us to carry out a similar calculation within an `` arbitrary '' qft model . </S>",
    "<S> however , it should be stressed that in a self - consistent rge analysis of the chosen model the obtained rges should be accompanied by the so - called threshold ( matching ) corrections ( see , e.g.,refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the recent sm results ) . </S>",
    "<S> avb is grateful to the organizers and conveniers of the acat2013 workshop for the invitation and for arranging such a nice event . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we would like to thank m.  kalmykov for drawing our attention to the problem and stimulating discussions . the work is supported in part by rfbr grants 11 - 02 - 01177-a , 12 - 02 - 00412-a , and by jinr grant no . </S>",
