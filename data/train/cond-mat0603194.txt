    "strong electronic correlations produce a rich variety of phenomena .",

    "it is widely believed that the origin of high-@xmath7 superconductivity is related to the nature of undoped systems@xcite , which are mott insulators with an antiferromagnetic order .",
    "recently - discovered perovskite cuprate sr@xmath0care@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3@xcite is a magnetic insulator which has spontaneous magnetization at room temperature and in some respects resembles parent materials of high-@xmath7 superconductors .",
    "it is expected that the ferromagnetism of sr@xmath0care@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 might be caused by strong electronic correlations due to a similar mechanism to the antiferromagnetism of parent materials of high-@xmath7 superconductors .",
