    "in the past decade , graphene @xcite became one of the most studied materials due to its unusual properties that are attractive from the perspective of basic physics as well as from that of a future technology .",
    "in graphene , the two - dimensional hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms provides for a gapless electronic bandstructure which consist of two bands touching each other at two dirac points located at the independent corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "the fermi energy of natural graphene lies in the vicinity of the dirac points , where the bands have linear dispersion and conical shape .",
    "therefore at low energies , the bandstructure of graphene can be modeled by two dirac cones and electrons behave as massless dirac particles with a valley isospin .",
    "after the discovery of graphene , there has been a significant effort @xcite to create artificial systems with hexagonal symmetry that mimic the unique properties of dirac quasiparticles .",
    "the successful experimental realization of dirac quasiparticles was reported in systems of cold atoms in hexagonal optical lattices,@xcite in photonic crystals created by a hexagonal array of optical waveguides , @xcite and in two - dimensional electron gases with hexagonal superlattices.@xcite the main advantage of these artificial systems is that one can control and tune the system parameters ( i.e. , the lattice constant and hopping parameters ) independently . that makes it possible to study features that are not observable in normal graphene , e.g. , the extremely large pseudomagnetic fields induced by strain , kekul lattices , edge states , etc .",
    "one of the interesting possibilities in artificial graphene is to induce lattice anisotropy by tuning the hopping parameters between the lattice sites .",
    "the theory based on the nearest - neighbor tight - binding approximation predicts @xcite that by changing the hopping parameters , both dirac cones are shifted away from the corners of the brillouin zone and become elliptical instead of circular . with increasing anisotropy",
    ", the dirac cones merge and an energy gap is created .",
    "this causes a topological phase transition @xcite where the system turns from a semimetal into an insulator . at the critical point of this merging",
    ", the energy bands touch only in a single point with an unusual dispersion relation in its vicinity.@xcite in one direction in k - space , the dispersion is linear as in the standard dirac cone but in the perpendicular direction , the dispersion is quadratic as in the case of massive electrons .    in normal graphene , lattice anisotropy could be induced by application of uniaxial strain that changes the distance between the lattice sites .",
    "but the values of strain that would lead to the topological phase transition are unrealistically large owing to the large graphene stiffness.@xcite thus , merging of the dirac points was demonstrated experimentally in systems of cold atoms @xcite and microwave photonic crystals @xcite where the distance between lattice sites can be varied much more than in normal graphene . in spite of some efforts,@xcite a merging of the dirac points has not yet been confirmed in any electronic system .    here , we show analytically and numerically that a merging of dirac points appears also in electronic artificial graphene under uniaxial compressive strain. we study artificial graphene created in a two - dimensional electron gas modulated by a triangular lattice of repulsive potentials , e.g. , repulsive molecules on a copper surface @xcite or a muffin - tin potential of antidots in a semiconductor heterostructure.@xcite in such systems , the electrons are repelled into the space between the antidots which leads to hexagonal symmetry .",
    "the lowest energy bands of artificial graphene are similar to the two - level tight - binding bandstructure of natural graphene although the electrons are not bound to any attractive potential .",
    "the lattice constant of artificial graphene can be orders of magnitude larger than in natural graphene and , moreover , the position of the artificial lattice sites can be easily tuned .",
    "strain is simulated by tuning the distance between the repulsive triangular potentials along the armchair direction .",
    "when the antidot lattice is stretched , the dirac points are shifted away from the corners of the brillouin zone into its interior , but they always exist . on the other hand , with increasing compressive strain , both dirac points are moving along the edge of the brillouin zone towards each other until they merge with a dispersion as described above . for larger compression ,",
    "a bulk gap is created .",
    "we believe that our theoretical results could be verified experimentally in the recently created molecular graphene,@xcite where a two - dimensional electron gas on the cu surface is modulated by a triangular antidot lattice of repulsive molecules ( co or coronene ) . here , the presence of a dirac energy spectrum is proven by measurements of the density of states ( dos ) which is similar to typical graphene dos with the zero value at the energy corresponding to the dirac point .",
    "the authors of [ ] performed an experiment where the artificial graphene was elongated in the armchair direction by about 30% .",
    "they observed no gap opening in the dos and that is consistent with our numerical results for the case of streched artificial graphene .",
    "nevertheless , our numerical calculations of the dos show that the molecular graphene with coronene @xcite is a very promising candidate to observe the merging of the dirac points and related gap opening in the dos .",
    "this should occur , however , for a lattice compression of about 25% , and that is technologically feasible .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the second section ,",
    "we review the results of the analytical tight - binding calculations that describe the merging of the dirac points in the hexagonal lattice with the hopping matrix anisotropy . in the third section , we define mathematically the model of artificial graphene and discuss the effect of uniaxial strain . then we describe the technique that we used to calculate the numerical results .",
    "the fourth section contains our numerical results of the bandstructure for artificial graphene under uniaxial strain .",
    "the calculations show that the merging of the dirac points occurs in the artificial graphene under compressive strain in the armchair direction .",
    "the fifth section shows the analytical calculation of the low - energy bandstructure of strained artificial graphene in the nearly - free electron approximation , which is valid for weak potentials .",
    "the analytical formulas confirm the merging of the dirac points in the compressed artificial graphene and are in a good agreement with the numerical results . in the sixth section",
    ", we discuss the realizability of our calculations in real experimental situations and we conclude that the merging of the dirac points should be observable in the recent experiment with molecular graphene with coronene.@xcite",
    "in this section , we review the results of the nearest - neighbor tight - binding calculations @xcite concerning the bandstructure of a hexagonal lattice with anisotropy in the hopping matrix elements . we examine the positions of the dirac points in the brillouin zone .",
    "normal graphene consists of a triangular bravais lattice with a pair of carbon atoms located in its primitive cell .",
    "the lattice vectors are @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a lattice constant and @xmath2 is the distance between neighboring carbon atoms .",
    "the corresponding reciprocal lattice is triangular as well with a hexagonal brillouin zone with the side length @xmath3 . in the nearest - neighbor tight - binding approximation",
    ", each carbon atom possesses one localized electronic state that slightly overlaps with its three nearest neighbors .",
    "these overlaps are in general characterized by three hopping parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-1](a ) ) . in the isotropic case ,",
    "all hopping parameters are equal .",
    "if we take the hopping anisotropy in armchair direction , we get @xmath7 .",
    "then , the bandstructure can be written in the form @xmath8 where we have defined @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the vectors connecting an atom with its neighbors .",
    "( see eq.[deltr ] ) and corresponding hopping parameters @xmath12 .",
    "( b ) the repeated brillouin zone scheme of graphene .",
    "the brillouin zone contains a symmetry point @xmath13 and a pair of independent corners k ( green empty circles ) and k ( green full circles ) which are periodically repeated around the reciprocal lattice points ( black crosses ) .",
    "when @xmath9 and @xmath14 , the dirac points are located on a line @xmath15 . for @xmath16 , the dirac points are located inside the brillouin zone ( red lines ) and for @xmath17 the dirac points lie at the edge ( blues lines ) . for @xmath18 the dirac points",
    "merge at s ( black dots ) . ]",
    "the bandstructure consists of two bands that touch at zero energy at the dirac points .",
    "we obtain their position in the reciprocal space by solving @xmath19 which implies the conditions @xmath20 the conditions give two independent dirac points per brillouin zone which are periodically repeated through the whole reciprocal space .",
    "to study the evolution of the dirac points with increasing hopping anisotropy , it is more convenient to use the repeated brillouin zone scheme and to focus on the dirac points @xmath21 and @xmath22 located at @xmath23 for the case of hopping anisotropy in the armchair direction , the position of the dirac points in reciprocal space is restricted to the @xmath24 axis .",
    "moreover , the positions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are symmetric around the point s at @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , in the following text , we discuss mostly only the position of @xmath21 .",
    "the position and existence of dirac points is given by the value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath26 .",
    "firstly , if @xmath27 , the dirac point @xmath21 lies inside the brillouin zone ( red lines in fig .",
    "[ fig-1](b ) ) and the lowest value of @xmath28 is limited by the value @xmath29 for @xmath30 ( point c ) . for @xmath31 ( isotropic lattice ) ,",
    "the dirac point lies exactly at the corner of the brillouin zone k with @xmath32 . secondly ,",
    "if @xmath17 the dirac point is located at the edge of the brillouin zone ( blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig-1](b ) ) and for the critical point @xmath33 , both @xmath21 and @xmath22 merge at the point s. thirdly , for @xmath34 , dirac points no longer exist and an energy gap opens .",
    "the hopping anisotropy discussed above could be achieved in normal graphene by applying an uniaxial strain in the armchair direction .",
    "when the graphene sample is stretched , the interatomic distance @xmath35 increases .",
    "then , the overlap of electron wavefunctions is suppressed and the hopping parameter @xmath5 decreases .",
    "this corresponds to the situation where @xmath36 . on the other hand , when the sample is compressed , the interatomic distance @xmath35 decreases and @xmath5 increases .",
    "then @xmath37 and it increases with increasing compression . in principle , it could be possible to observe a merging of the dirac points ( for @xmath18 ) in graphene , but , unfortunately , the mechanical stiffness of graphene is very large @xcite and the sufficient compression to obtain @xmath18 is unreachable .    to observe a merging of the dirac points , one has to arrange a system with hexagonal symmetry where it is possible to tune the hopping parameters in a wider interval than in normal graphene .",
    "this was already shown in a lattice of cold atoms @xcite or a photonic crystal,@xcite but not yet for any electronic system .",
    "our aim is to study a merging of the dirac points in electronic artificial graphene described in the next section .",
    "there have been several theoretical and experimental attempts to create an electronic artificial graphene .",
    "most of them are based on a nanopatterning of a two - dimensional electron gas by an external periodic potential .",
    "one possibility is to introduce a hexagonal lattice of potential wells , which was performed lithographically in a gaas heterostructure.@xcite in the present paper , we study an artificial graphene created from a two - dimensional electron gas by application of a repulsive triangular potential of antidots @xmath38 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-2](a ) ) .",
    "this kind of artificial graphene was extensively studied @xcite and it captures the main features of the experiments with molecular graphene , which is a two - dimensional electron gas on the copper surface modulated by the repulsive molecules of co @xcite and coronene.@xcite    it can be shown @xcite that the wavefunctions of the electrons from the two lowest energy bands are localized around the centers of the triangles formed by the antidots and thus form a hexagonal lattice . consequently , the two lowest energy bands of artificial graphene are very similar to those of normal graphene .",
    "namely , there is a pair of dirac points with linear dispersion in their vicinity .",
    "the effect of strain discussed in the previous section can be easily achieved in this artificial graphene by prolonging or reducing the dimension of the triangular antidot lattice in the armchair direction .",
    "this consequently changes the distances in the underlying hexagonal electron lattice .     and",
    "the antidot radius is @xmath40 and the lattice is compressed in the @xmath41 ( armchair ) direction with @xmath42 .",
    "( b ) the corresponding reciprocal lattice ( crosses ) is triangular as well and it is strained in the horizontal direction . in general , the first brillouin zone is an irregular hexagon and we use the repeated brillouin zone scheme ( dashed lines ) .",
    "because the antidot lattice is compressed , the dirac points @xmath21 and @xmath22 are shifted away from the corners @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the brillouin zone towards the point s. ]      the antidot potential @xmath38 consists of repulsive circles with radius @xmath45 ordered on a triangular lattice with lattice constant @xmath1 and reads @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the potential strength , @xmath48 is the heaviside step function and @xmath49 are the lattice sites spanned by the vectors @xmath50 where the parameter @xmath51 represents an uniaxial strain in the @xmath41 ( armchair ) direction . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the lattice is prolonged in the @xmath41 direction and for @xmath53 it is compressed . in the case",
    "@xmath54 , we obtain the unstrained triangular lattice vectors . the corresponding reciprocal lattice to is @xmath55 , where @xmath56    the brillouin zone of such a lattice is hexagonal ( see fig .  [ fig-2](b ) ) ,",
    "but in contrast to the calculations in section ii , it is not a regular hexagon unless @xmath54 .",
    "its side lengths are @xmath57 \\label{sides}\\ ] ] and the positions of @xmath43 and @xmath44 points are @xmath58 , \\ \\ \\",

    "a constant strain on the hexagonal lattice would only lead to the deformation of the regular hexagons but would not change the connectivity of the lattice . for @xmath60 also the brillouin zone is no longer hexagonal but square and we get @xmath61 . for @xmath62 ,",
    "the antidot lattice becomes the same as the lattice for @xmath63 but it is rotated by 90@xmath64 with the rescaled lattice constant @xmath65 and strain parameter @xmath66 .",
    "for example , for @xmath67 , the antidot lattice again corresponds to the unstrained artificial graphene with @xmath68 and zig - zag orientation in the @xmath41 direction .",
    "the previous discussion shows , that it is sufficient to restrict the values of @xmath51 to the interval @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "the electron wavefunction in artificial graphene is described by the schrdinger equation @xmath70 with the hamiltonian @xmath71 where the lattice potential @xmath38 given by is periodic with the lattice vectors @xmath72 .",
    "then the electron wavefunctions are of the bloch form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is restricted to the first brillouin zone .",
    "the schrdinger equation then becomes @xmath75 \\delta_{\\mathbf{g},\\mathbf{g ' } }    +   v_{\\mathbf{g'}-\\mathbf{g } } \\right\\ } c^{\\mathbf{k}}_{\\mathbf{g ' } } = 0 , \\label{schserfin}\\ ] ] where the fourier coefficients of the lattice potential are @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the bessel function of the first kind and @xmath78 is the area of the unit cell .",
    ".   shows that due to the rotational symmetry of an antidot , the fourier coefficients of @xmath38 depend only on the length of the wavevector @xmath79 .",
    ".   shows that the periodic lattice potential mixes only those plane waves with wavevectors that are shifted by reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath80 . solving",
    "numerically we get the complete band structure @xmath81 .    in general ,",
    "the number of terms in the sum is infinite ( and the number of the corresponding equations as well ) but in practice it is sufficient to assume a finite number of reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath80 . because we are interested in the lowest energy bands @xmath81 , the most important terms in are the plane waves with the smallest wavevectors .",
    "therefore , we restrict the summation in to the wavevector @xmath82 plus a few hexagonal shells of reciprocal lattice points centered around @xmath83 .",
    "the calculated energy bands saturate quickly with increasing number of hexagonal shells @xmath84 and a sufficient value of @xmath84 depends on the strength of potential . in our calculations , we use mostly @xmath85 .    it can be easily shown that the electron eigenenergies in scale as @xmath86 and therefore , we introduce the energy unit @xmath87 which corresponds to the free electron energy at the k point",
    ". then , we use the dimensionless parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "in this section , we present the results of our numerical calculations describing the bandstructure of artificial graphene under uniaxial strain .",
    "firstly , we show the results for the unstrained case @xmath54 .",
    "it was shown before @xcite that the two lowest energy bands of artificial graphene are similar to the bandstructure of normal graphene .",

    "the free - electron bandstructure ( dashed lines ) is shown for comparison .",

    "one can observe that when applying the antidot potential , the two lowest energy bands ( which are doubly - degenerated for @xmath91 ) repel each other except at the k point where the dirac cone is formed .",
    "this process was analytically described in ref .   for small potential strengths in the nearly - free electron ( nfe ) approximation and its generalization for the strained artificial graphene",
    "is presented in the following section .",
    "figure  [ fig-4](a ) shows the ratio of the numerically calculated fermi velocity @xmath92 ( the slope of the bands crossing at k ) and the nfe prediction @xcite @xmath93 as a function of the potential strength for various antidot radii .",

    "as expected , the nfe approximation is quite accurate for small values of the potential strength independent of @xmath90 . with increasing potential strength , the fermi velocity decreases , an effect that is more pronounced for larger antidots .",
    "in the limit @xmath96 , the fermi velocity saturates at a constant value which is relatively close to @xmath94 , for @xmath97 .    in order to have dirac cones as the sole energy values in the vicinity of the dirac points ,",
    "the energy gap at the m point ( see fig .  [ fig-3 ] ) should be large enough .",
    "this energy gap increases with increasing potential strength and for @xmath98 , the value of the second band at the point m is higher than the dirac point .",
    "then , the dirac cones are the only energy values around dirac points . fig .  [ fig-4](b )",
    "shows the minimal value of the potential strength @xmath95 as a function of the antidot radius . for @xmath99 ,",
    "the minimal value of the potential is of the order of @xmath100 but for very small @xmath90 the potential must be much stronger .      as was shown in section ii , the tight - binding model on a hexagonal lattice displays dirac points at the corners of the brillouin zone @xmath101 and @xmath102 . when we apply a hopping anisotropy in the armchair direction , the dirac points are shifted and lie somewhere at the line @xmath103 ( see fig .

    "the hopping anisotropy is induced by applying a mechanical strain . when the lattice is stretched ( or compressed ) ,",
    "then @xmath36 ( or @xmath106 ) .",
    "however , to describe a realistic model of normal graphene , the hexagonal model from section ii is not sufficient because the change of the lattice geometry due to the applied strain must be taken into account .",
    "@xcite but the results of the realistic model @xcite capture essentially the same features as in the case of the undeformed hexagonal model discussed above .    in the case of electronic artificial graphene , the effect of strain can be obtained by tuning the lattice constant in the armchair direction .",

    "we would like to stress that the same effect can be obtained by stretching the antidot lattice in the zigzag ( horizontal ) direction",
