    "as well - known , general relativity is based on general covariance and the `` gauge degree of freedom '' , which is unphysical degree of freedom of perturbations , arises due to this general covariance .",

    "so , it is worthwhile to investigate higher - order gauge - invariant perturbation theory from a general point of view .    according to this motivations",
    ", we have been formulating the higher - order general - relativistic gauge - invariant perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "these works are based on the single assumption that _ we already know the procedure to find gauge - invariant variables for linear - order metric perturbations_. ( conjecture [ conjecture : decomposition - conjecture - o28 - 09 ] in this article ) and our formulation is well - defined except for this assumption .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to give a brief outline of a proof of this assumption  @xcite .",
    "here , we concentrate on the second - kind gauge in perturbation theories with general covariance  @xcite . in perturbation theories ,",
    "we always treat two spacetime manifolds .",

    "our starting point of the construction of gauge - invariant variables is the following assumption for @xmath29 :    [ conjecture : decomposition - conjecture - o28 - 09 ] if there is a symmetric tensor field @xmath29 of the second rank , whose gauge transformation rule is @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath23 @xmath33 , then there exist a tensor field @xmath34 and a vector field @xmath35 such that @xmath29 is decomposed as @xmath29 @xmath36 @xmath34 @xmath25 @xmath37 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are transformed as @xmath38 @xmath31 @xmath39 @xmath23 @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath31 @xmath42 @xmath23 @xmath43 under the gauge transformation ( [ eq : bruni-47-one - o28 - 09 ] ) , respectively",
