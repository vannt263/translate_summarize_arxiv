    "globular clusters are excellent birthplaces for black hole ( bh ) binaries . in our galaxy ,",
    "a globular cluster ( gc ) contains typically @xmath2 stars and resides normally in the galactic halo .",
    "typical ages of these clusters are estimated to be 12 billion years , and the clusters contain the oldest stars known in our galaxy .",
    "stellar evolution theory predicts that massive stars with mass above 10  would evolve into black holes or neutron stars in @xmath3 years . for a typical gc that follows the initial mass function ( imf ) given by scalo ( 1986 ) ,",
    "a significant number of bhs ( @xmath4 for initial masses @xmath525 ) should have been born .",
    "these bhs would be the most massive stars in the cluster , and hence dynamical two - body relaxation causes them to sink rapidly towards the core . in the core",
    ", bh binaries are expected to form .",
    "the single bhs form binaries preferentially with another bh , and bhs born in binaries with a lower mass stellar component rapidly exchange the companion for another bh through three body relaxation processes .",
    "if these bh binaries merge within the hubble time , they would become excellent sources for upcoming gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has been argued that globular clusters are unlikely places to harbor bh mergers ( or subsequently to harbor a massive central black hole ) if we consider binary - single interactions alone ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations show that binary - single interactions tend to throw out these bh binaries and only 8% of bhs will be retained in the gc within its lifetime .",
    "miller & hamilton ( 2002 ) argued that this picture will be different if we consider binary - binary interactions .",
    "a substantial fraction of hierarchical triple bh systems can result from binary - binary interactions .",
    "the well - known kozai mechanism ( @xcite ) can then drive the inner binaries of a significant fraction of these triples to extreme eccentricities and thus reduce their time to coalescence to be shorter than the hubble time .",
    "this is because the coalescence time scale @xmath6 due to gravitational radiation for a binary with fixed semi - major axis @xmath7 has a strong dependence on the eccentricity @xmath8 through the quantity @xmath9 ( @xcite ) , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the masses of each binary component . in their paper ,",
    "miller & hamilton ( 2002 ) have compared the coalescence time scale with the time scale for the system to be disrupted by interactions with field stars .",
    "they concluded that in a substantial fraction of cases , the system will achieve extreme eccentricities ( @xmath13 ) and will merge by gravitational radiation before the disruption .",
    "the bh mergers may thus be retained in the gcs and a central intermediate - mass bh may form through subsequent mergers .",
    "we are motivated by the fact that the proposed mechanism promises stellar mass bh - bh mergers with extremely high initial eccentricities and that they are potential sources for upcoming gravitational wave detectors such as ligo .",
    "we investigate in this paper whether or not these systems would still possess finite eccentricities when the emitted gravitational waves enter ligo s frequency band .",
    "the eccentricities of these sources are particularly interesting as no astrophysical merger sources were expected before to possess significant eccentricities when they reach the ligo band .",
    "current efforts in detecting gws from coalescing bh binary sources thus focus on waves from circular orbits ( see @xcite for recent development ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is well - known that the gravitational waveform of an eccentric binary could be significantly different from that of a circular one and different detection strategies are required for optimal detections ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our work can thus help shed light on the importance of the eccentricities for detecting gws from these sources .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate in detail the eccentricity evolution of these merger systems under the impact of gravitational radiation reaction ( simplified as the gr effect ) .",
    "this is in addition to the kozai mechanism and the post - newtonian periastron precession ( simplified as the pn effect ) considered by previous authors .",
    "it has been long realized ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that gravitational radiation reaction is very efficient in circularizing coalescing binaries . for the systems we are considering",
    ", this circularization effect would have to compete with the `` eccentricity enhancing '' kozai mechanism . under the kozai mechanism and the pn effect",
    ", the system tries to maintain secular cyclic eccentricity oscillations at fixed amplitude ( with exceptions at critical inclination angles , see text ) .",
    "the gr effect operates most efficiently near the minimum @xmath14 of each cycle . in some cases , it could drive a system near its minimum @xmath14 directly towards merger .",
    "in other cases , it would affect the minimum @xmath14 and alter the otherwise fairly strict periodic evolution trajectory of the system .",
    "in particular , it will enhance rapidly the importance of the pn effect which in turn would introduce fast oscillations to destroy the kozai resonance .",
    "the kozai resonance will eventually be quenched either directly by the gr effect , or by the pn effect before the gr effect takes over .",
    "we will discuss the details of these effects and their implications for the evolution of the eccentricities and gravitational wave frequencies .    in section  [ kozai",
    "] , we give a summary of the relevant features of the kozai mechanism and derive an explicit general expression for the minimum @xmath14 ( or maximum eccentricity ) the system can reach for arbitrary values of bh masses and initial eccentricities . in section  [ grr ] , we discuss the evolution of the system parameters under gravitational radiation reaction ( the gr effect ) .",
    "the equations of motion are described in subsection  [ gp ] .",
    "we describe technical details to estimate the minimum @xmath14 the system can reach in subsection  [ epsm ] . the pn effect and its role in determining the evolution of the gravitational wave frequency",
    "are described in subsection  [ pn ] .",
    "a procedure to obtain the relation of the gravitational wave frequencies and the eccentricity at various evolution stages is given in subsection  [ s_f_gw ] .",
    "two numerical examples are presented in subsection  [ example ] . in section  [ eccn ]",
    ", we estimate the eccentricity distribution when the gravitational waves enters the ligo band .",
    "our results are then summarized in section  [ concl ] .",
    "the kozai mechanism was initially proposed ( @xcite ) to describe the perturbation of asteroids due to jupiter .",
    "this mechanism describes the secular evolution of the orbit of a hierarchical triple system as a result of cyclic exchange of angular momentum between the inner binary and orbit of the distant tertiary .",
    "one of the most interesting results of the kozai mechanism is that the eccentricity of the inner binary can reach very large values while the semi - major axis remains unchanged , provided that the initial mutual inclination angle of the two binaries reaches a certain critical value .",
    "although the mechanism was proposed for a system where the mass of one component in the inner binary is much smaller than those of the others , the mechanism has then been found to operate in hierarchical triple systems with arbitrary masses ( @xcite ) .",
    "a hierarchical triple star system consists of a close binary of masses @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and a tertiary @xmath15 in a much wider outer orbit ( fig .  [ geo ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of the system can be treated as if it consists of an inner binary of point masses @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and an outer binary of point masses @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the separations of the masses each binary are denoted @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the mutual inclination angle of the two binaries is denoted @xmath19 .",
    "for the inner and outer binaries respectively , we denote the eccentricities @xmath20 and @xmath21 , reduced masses @xmath22 , semimajor axes @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we define @xmath25 as the argument of pericenter of the inner binary relative to the line of the descending node .    throughout this paper , we frequently use quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 to simplify our discussion .",
    "angular momentum is normalized to have dimension @xmath28 by dividing by the quantity @xmath29 .",
    "we use notation @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for the normalized magnitude of total angular momentum of the triple system , of the outer binary , and of the inner binary respectively .",
    "our @xmath30 and @xmath31 are related to dimensionless quantities @xmath33 and @xmath34 used in previous literature by @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "it follows that @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and that @xmath30 is related to @xmath31 and @xmath39 through the following trigonometric relation @xmath40 as we shall see , during the binary s kozai mechanism - induced evolution , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath23 are conserved while @xmath14 changes .",
    "it follows that @xmath41 is the critical condition for the system to be able to evolve to @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath50 can be expanded in powers of @xmath54 .",
    "the first non - zero contribution comes from the term of order @xmath55 , labeled as quadrupole term because of the degree of the legendre polynomial associated with it .",
    "this term is sufficient for our discussion as we are only concerned about cases with large initial mutual inclination angle @xmath56 ( see @xcite for discussions concerning the octupole terms of order @xmath57 ) .",
    "it is this perturbative hamiltonian @xmath50 that leads to a secular evolution of the triple system . in the first approximation",
    ", the secular evolution can be described by @xmath50 doubly - averaged over the mean anomaly of both the inner and the outer orbits .",
    "it turns out that the doubly - averaged @xmath50 , the total angular momentum of the system ( @xmath30 ) , the energy of each binary ( or equivalently @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , and the magnitude of the angular momentum of the outer binary ( @xmath31 , or equivalently @xmath21 ) are conserved quantities . the secular evolution of the triple system can therefore be fully described in terms of time - evolving @xmath14 and @xmath25 .",
    "a useful constant of integration can be derived from equation  ( [ cosi ] ) , @xmath58 note that the quantity on the left hand side is conserved as long as the total angular momentum ( @xmath30 ) and that of the outer binary ( @xmath31 ) are conserved .",
    "also , whenever @xmath59 , @xmath60 is a constant .",
    "the secular evolution is a result of coherent additions of perturbations from the tertiary to the inner binary .",
    "therefore , any mechanism that perturbs the phase relation of the system could modify the evolution of @xmath14 and @xmath25 . for black hole systems ,",
    "an important effect comes from the general relativistic periastron precession of the inner binary .",
    "inclusion of this effect can be found in miller & hamilton ( 2002 ) and blaes , lee & socrates ( 2002 ) . in summary",
    ", contribution of the periastron precession in the first - order post - newtonian approximation can be added to the doubly - averaged hamiltonian as @xmath61 , where , @xmath62 and @xmath63 is a quantity related to the evolution time scale .",
    "apparently the influence of the periastron precession ( abbreviated as pn effect ) is the largest ( in the sense that @xmath64 is the largest ) for systems consisting of a tight and massive inner binary and a light , far - out third component . with the addition of this pn effect ,",
    "the total hamiltonian remains conserved .",
