    "according to the recent definition given by gershberg et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , these stars are on the lower part of the ms and show activity similar to the sun ( sporadic flares , dark spots , variable emission from the chromosphere and the corona , radio , x - ray and uv outbursts ) .",
    "the uv cet - type stars are relatively young ( possibly zero - age or pre - ms stars ) with ages @xmath0myrs or younger .",
    "they may be former members of recently dispersed t or ob associations or may be ejected stars from associations by a three body encounter ( like run - away t tauri stars ) .",
    "a local dispersed association does not appear unlikely : the translucent high - latitude cloud mbm 12 with ongoing star formation is located at @xmath1pc ( hearty et al .",
    "2000 ) and the tw hya association at @xmath2pc , which has dispersed its gas and dust ( webb et al .",
    "1999 ) are already known . hence , there are indeed young t associations within @xmath0 pc .",
    "a few isolated young nearby stars are also known , e.g. gj  182 at 27pc and 20myrs .",
    "we observe all these stars with foces and feros , the high resolution echelle spectrograph of the calar alto observatory in spain and at eso la silla observatory in chile , respectively .",
    "a first reduction of the spectra of some stars shows the existence of strong lithium absorption line at 6708 . as an example",
    ", hip  71631 shows strong lithium absorption at 6707with @xmath3 , stronger than calcium at 6718 .",
    "this star has been classified as g0.ve .",
    "the parallax given by hipparcos measurement is @xmath4mas which corresponds to a distance of @xmath5pc .",
    "the v - magnitude is @xmath6mag .",
    "according to the hr - diagramm and the dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) tracks and isochrones the star has @xmath7  and an age of @xmath8  years .",
    "the high resolution echelle spectra enables us to study the stellar properties of the stars in detail .",
    "especially we can measure radial velocity , temperature , metallicity , gravity and rotational velocity ( @xmath9 ) to distinguish between pre - ms - dwarfs and post - ms - giants .",
    "stars in the sample which appear young will be proposed for vlbi observations to spatially resolve possible coronal loops and they are prime targets for direct imaging of extra - solar planets in the ir ."
