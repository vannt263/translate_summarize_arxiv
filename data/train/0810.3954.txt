    "the renormalization group flow equations for the world - sheet nonlinear sigma models arise from quantizing the classical action @xmath0where @xmath1 is the string coupling constant , @xmath2 is a @xmath3-dimensional riemannian manifold ( i.e. world sheet ) , @xmath4 is a @xmath5-dimensional riemannian manifold ( i.e. target space ) , and @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 is a map . to ( perturbatively ) quantize the classical theory , a momentum cutoff @xmath15 must be introduced .",
    "this gives rise to a one parameter family of quantum field theories indexed by the cutoff @xmath16 .",
    "the target space metric becomes @xmath16 dependent and plays the role of the coupling constants .",
    "the requirement that the one parameter family of field theories be equivalent on length scales @xmath17 leads to the renormalization group ( rg ) flow equations @xmath18 in the perturbative regime ( @xmath19 ) , the @xmath20-functions @xmath21 can be expanded in powers of @xmath22 @xcite : @xmath23here we are using @xmath24 where @xmath25 . introducing time  by @xmath26 , the rg flow equations become @xmath27truncating at the first order in @xmath22 gives @xmath28 in the perturbative regime , the first order truncation should provide an acceptable approximation to the full rg flow .",
    "however , this is difficult to quantify as a rigorous definition of the @xmath20-functions requires a non - perturbative quantization of the nonlinear sigma model , and this has not yet been shown to exist .",
    "as has been noted previously @xcite , the first order truncation ( [ rg ] ) is _",
    "ricci flow_. it is easy to see ( e.g. by considering the sphere ) that there exist many solutions to ricci flow which become singular in finite time . in @xcite hamilton showed that at a finite singular time @xmath29 , the riemannian curvature blows up , i.e. @xmath30 . therefore for times near a singular time for ricci flow , from the perturbative expansion for the beta - functions ( [ beta ] ) , it appears that the second order correction term would dominate even for @xmath19 .",
    "this would signal a regime change where the first order truncation ( i.e. ricci flow ) is no longer a valid approximation for the full rg flow .",
    "this suggests the strategy of using the second order ( two - loop ) truncation @xmath31as a measure of the error in approximating the full rg flow ( [ rg ] ) by ricci flow ( [ rg1 ] ) .",
    "a related motivation for studying ( [ rg2 ] ) , as discussed in @xcite , is that in certain situations , it is enough to consider the second order rg equations ( [ rg2 ] ) to establish the existence of a continuum limit @xcite",
    ". finally , we note that it is tempting to view the higher order truncations of the rg flow equations ( rg ) as natural modifications of ricci flow . in this light ,",
    "the @xmath20-function expansion ( [ beta ] ) in powers of @xmath22 generates specific modifications to ricci flow . as with other equations that arise from physical considerations",
    ", these equations may have nice  properties , which we think , at the very least , is worth investigating .",
    "however , we note that whereas ( [ rg2 ] ) can be studied using parabolic techniques ( at least for @xmath22 small enough ) , the third and higher order correction would involve polynomials of the curvature and its derivatives@xcite .",
    "this would mean that in trying to study the third and higher order equations as evolution equations , some form of the nash - moser implicit function theorem would be necessary to overcome the resulting loss of derivatives .",
    "as a first step in the analysis of the second order rg flow ( [ rg2 ] ) , we prove the stability of the flat torus , and with suitable rescaling hyperbolic space , under the flow .",
    "see sections [ torus ] and hyperbolic for the theorems and proofs .",
    "the main theorems are theorem torus and theorem [ modified hyperbolic ] .",
    "let @xmath33 be a flat riemannian metric on a closed @xmath34dimensional manifold @xmath35 . in this section",
    "we show that there exists a neighborhood of @xmath33 in an appropriate function space such that if @xmath36 is in this neighborhood , then the solution @xmath37 of the renormalization group flow with @xmath38 converges exponentially quickly to a centermanifold at @xmath33 consisting entirely of flat metrics@xmath39 to do so we will apply maximal regularity theory , as introduced by @xcite , and applied to fully nonlinear equations in @xcite . see @xcite for an introduction to these methods in a geometric setting .",
    "the argument is similar to that used to show the stability of the ricci flow at flat metrics @xcite , and at hyperbolic metrics @xcite ; however , the second order renormalization group flow is no longer quasilinear , and so results for fully nonlinear equations must be used ( see the cross - curvature flow result in @xcite for another fully nonlinear example )",
    ". we will work with the nested little hlder spaces of 2-tensors , denoted @xmath40 , which are the completion of the @xmath41 2-tensors in the hlder norm @xmath42 .",
    "letting @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 one has @xmath48with @xmath49 and @xmath50 the continuous interpolation spaces required to apply maximal regularity theory ( for an introduction to these spaces , their connection with the more familiar real interpolation spaces , and a justification of the above inclusion , see the beginning of section 3.3 gik02 ) .",
    "we prove the following theorem :    [ torus]let @xmath33 be a flat riemannian metric on a closed @xmath34dimensional manifold @xmath35 , @xmath51 and let @xmath37 satisfy the second order rg flow @xmath52there exists a ball @xmath53 @xmath54 , @xmath55 , such that if @xmath56 then the solution @xmath37 of ( [ 2nd order rf ] ) converges exponentially quickly to a flat metric .",
    "following @xcite , in order to obtain a strictly parabolic equation , for any positive definite @xmath3-tensors @xmath57 we define a vector field @xmath58and a modified flow @xmath59where @xmath60 is the lie derivative of @xmath61 in the direction @xmath62 we shall call this the second order deturck - rg flow .",
    "if @xmath61 is a solution of ( [ deturck - rgf ] ) , then @xmath63 is a solution of ( [ 2nd order rf ] ) , where @xmath64 is the family of diffeomorphisms generated by integrating the vector field @xmath65 . when @xmath66we see that @xmath33 is also a fixed point of ( [ deturck - rgf ] ) . by the standard first variation formula @xmath67 ( see theorem 1.174 @xcite ) , the linearization of the first two terms of the right hand side at @xmath33 is given by @xmath68where @xmath69is the lichnerowicz laplacian with respect to the metric @xmath70 and @xmath71 denotes the usual laplacian with respect to @xmath33 ( see chapter 3.3 in @xcite for complete details of the calculation ) .",
    "we denote @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "so letting @xmath74 , the linearization of ( [ deturck - rgf ] ) at a flat metric @xmath33 is @xmath75    the existence of an exponentially attractive centermanifold is a consequence of theorem 3.3 in @xcite , and so we verify its hypotheses .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite equation ( [ deturck - rgf ] ) as @xmath76where @xmath77is the linearization of the right hand side of ( deturck - rgf ) .",
    "the hypotheses of the theorem are :    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     we recall that an operator being sectorial roughly means that the spectrum is bounded in a wedge in a left half plane , and its resolvent is uniformly bounded on the comlementary right half plane . by definition ,",
    "the space @xmath78 consists of 2-tensors whose second derivatives are in @xmath79 ; as was shown in lemma 3.4 @xcite , by standard schauder estimates the operator @xmath80 @xmath81 is sectorial ; continuous frechet differentiability of @xmath82 and the existence of @xmath83 can be checked as in section 4 of @xcite .",
    "since @xmath84the kernel of @xmath80 consists of all parallel 2-tensors , and is an @xmath85 dimensional subspace of the tangent space of symmetric 2-tensors.therefore the hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied , and there is an @xmath55 such that if @xmath86 , there exists a centermanifold at @xmath33 of dimension at most @xmath85 that is exponentially attractive  for times @xmath87 .",
    "flat metrics are fixed points of the flow , and so since they are exponentially attracted to the centermanifold , they must lie on the centermanifold .",
    "since the space of flat metrics on the torus is @xmath85 dimensional , the centermanifold must consist precisely of flat metrics .",
    "we can in fact obtain a global result , using corollary 9.1.6 in @xcite to obtain long term existence .",
    "consider a solution @xmath61 of ( [ deturck - rgf ] ) . by definition ( [ w_u , g ] ) , if @xmath61 converges exponentially to a flat metric , then @xmath88 converges exponentially to zero .",
    "the curvature terms also converge exponentially to zero , and so the right hand side of ( [ deturck - rgf ] ) converges to zero exponentially and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 ( see also the proof of theorem 3.7 in @xcite . ) we therefore have global existence and convergence to a flat metric .    we have shown exponential convergence of solutions of deturck - rg flow , but we have exponential convergence of the second order rg flow as well .",
    "the idea is that if the norm of a vector field  @xmath91 decays exponentially , then the diffeomorphisms @xmath64 generated by the vector field converge exponentially to a fixed diffeomorphism .",
    "( to see this just calculate the length of the integral curves .",
    "see also lemma 3.5 and proposition 3.6 in @xcite . )",
    "since the solutions of ( [ deturck - rgf ] ) and ( [ 2nd order rf ] ) are related by the pullback @xmath92 , the theorem is proved .",
    "we next consider the stability of a closed hyperbolic manifold .",
    "let @xmath33 be a riemannian metric of constant negative curvature @xmath95on a closed @xmath34dimensional manifold @xmath35 with @xmath96 . in this case",
    "@xmath33 is not a fixed point of the second order rg flow ( [ 2nd order rf ] ) , and so we will instead consider an equation that is related to the renormalization group flow only by diffeomorphism and rescaling . to proceed , let @xmath61 satisfy the original rg flow @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "for a constant @xmath99 , let @xmath100 and @xmath101 , so that @xmath102 .",
    "define @xmath103 by @xmath104 where @xmath91 is the vector field ( [ w_u , g ] ) , and @xmath105 . then @xmath106 \\\\ & = & \\phi _ { t}^{\\ast } \\left ( c\\hat{g}(\\tau ( t))+\\frac{\\partial \\hat{g}}{\\partial \\tau } -l_{w_{u,\\hat{g}}}\\hat{g}(\\tau ( t))\\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\]]since @xmath107@xmath108 satisfies the evolution equation@xmath109for @xmath110 .",
    "this equation has a time - dependent coefficient @xmath111 , and so is no longer autonomous ; however , since the coefficient decays exponentially we can handle this by considering instead the system @xmath112 notice that we can explicity integrate the @xmath113 equation to get @xmath114 .",
    "this shows , in particular , that if @xmath115 is a solution to ( [ ergf ] ) , then @xmath116 will solve ( [ hrgf ] ) with @xmath117 defined via the formula @xmath118    since @xmath119 is a metric of constant curvature @xmath120 , we observe that @xmath121the lichnerowicz laplacian is @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "setting @xmath124we then get that @xmath125 is a fixed point for ( [ ergf ] ) . by ( lin ) and ( [ k - lich ] ) , it is clear that the linearization of ( [ ergf ] ) at @xmath126 is given by @xmath127letting @xmath128 denote the righthand side of the linearization , we see that @xmath129using the koiso bochner formula @xcite @xmath130where",
    "@xmath131 , yields @xmath132this shows that the spectrum of @xmath133 is strictly negative for @xmath96 .",
    "since the lichnerowicz laplacian is self - adjoint and elliptic , the resolvent bound follows again from standard schauder estimates ( see e.g. lemma 3.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , by theorem 9.1.7 in @xcite , one has exponential convergence of ( [ ergf ] ) for initial data in an appropriate neighborhood of @xmath125 .",
    "since we have an explicit formula for @xmath113 , letting @xmath134 we have proved the following theorem :    [ modified hyperbolic]let @xmath33 be a riemannian metric of constant curvature @xmath120 on a closed @xmath34dimensional manifold @xmath35 , @xmath96 , and let @xmath103 satisfy the modified deturck second order rg flow@xmath135where @xmath136 .",
    "then for sufficiently small @xmath22 , there exists a ball @xmath53 @xmath54 such that if @xmath137 then the solution @xmath103 of ( [ modscaldiffeo ] ) exists for all time and converges exponentially quickly to a metric of constant negative curvature .",
    "we have seen that @xmath103 converges to one of constant negative curvature , but what happens to the original solution of the second order rg flow ? recall that @xmath138 is a solution of the second order rg flow .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath139 blows up , but the vector field @xmath88 converges exponentially to zero .",
    "therefore , one has the following corollary :    [ thm hyperbolic]let @xmath33 be a riemannian metric of constant curvature @xmath140 on a closed @xmath34dimensional manifold @xmath35 , @xmath96 , and let @xmath37 satisfy the second order rg flow @xmath141then for sufficiently small @xmath22 , there exists a ball @xmath53 @xmath54 , @xmath142 , such that if @xmath143 , then the solution @xmath37 of ( [ rgf b ] ) exists for all time and becomes more homogeneous in time .",
    "we have established the stability of the torus , and with suitable rescaling hyperbolic space , under the second order ( two - loop ) rg flow ( [ rg2 ] ) .",
    "this shows that in a neighborhood of a flat , or with suitable rescaling a hyperbolic metric , the qualitative behavior of the first and second order rg flow equations are the same .",
    "in particular , this suggests that in these situations ricci flow is a good approximation to the full rg flow .",
    "one immediate application of this result is to produce approximate solutions to the rg flow that involve order @xmath144 corrections , and for which the perelman type entropy proposed by tseytlin @xcite ( see also @xcite ) is monotone , at least to order @xmath144 .",
    "the results contained in this article are only a first step in the analysis of the second order rg flow ( [ rg2 ] ) . clearly , it would be of interest to identify initial data which generate solutions for which the first and second order equations differ significantly .",
    "this could signal a breakdown of the perturbative regime and therefore would be of physical interest .",
    "it could also be of interest mathematically as the most likely mechanism for the breakdown would be the development of large curvature along the flow . depending on the behavior of the solutions to the second order rg flow , this may ( or may not ) lead to new applications in differential geometry .",
