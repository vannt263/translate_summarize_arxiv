    "observations indicate that most of the world oceans variability is confined in a thin layer limited from below by the permanent thermocline . there , the density is approximately uniform in the vertical but has important horizontal gradients .",
    "the latter imply the existence of a considerable reservoir of potential energy within this layer , stored in the isopycnals tilt and available to feeding baroclinic instability processes gill - green - simmons-74 .",
    "haine and marshall ( 1998 ) have argued that these processes are of outmost importance for the dynamics of the upper ocean .",
    "these authors pointed out that baroclinic instability waves can be efficient transport agents capable of stopping convective processes , thereby exerting a large influence in the thermodynamic state of the ocean .",
    "because the total depth of the ocean is much larger than that of the upper thermocline layer , the reduced - gravity setting has been commonly adopted to studying the upper ocean baroclinic instability fukamachi - mccreary - proehl-95,ripa - jfm-95,young - chen-95,beron - ripa-97 , ripa - dao-99,olascoaga - ripa-99,ripa - taxco-99,ripa - ams-99,ripa - jfm-00,ripa - barcelona-00,ripa - jfm-01 . in this setting the active fluid layer is considered as floating on top of a quiescent , infinitely deep layer .",
    "olascoaga ( 2001 ) showed , however , that a thick  but finite  abyssal active layer can substantially alter the stability properties of the upper ocean for certain baroclinic zonal flows , such as the atlantic north equatorial current ( anec ) @xcite .",
    "olascoaga ( 2001 ) considered spectral ( i.e. linear , normal - mode ) , formal ( or arnold ) , and nonlinear ( or lyapunov ) stability ( holm et al . , 1985 ; cf . also mcintyre and shepherd , 1987)holm - marsden - ratiu - weinstein-85,mcintyre - shepherd-87 in a 3-layer quasigeostrophic ( qg ) model .",
    "primary attention was given to the limit of a very thick bottom layer .",
    "the stability results were compared with those from a reduced - gravity 2-layer ( or 2.5-layer ) model @xcite , and assessments were made of the influence of the deep ocean on upper ocean baroclinic instability .    to make further assessments , in this paper we turn our attention to baroclinic instability saturation . employing shepherd s ( 1988 ) methodshepherd-88b , we establish and confront rigorous bounds on nonlinear instability saturation in 2.5- and 3-layer models .",
    "this method , which builds on the existence of a nonlinear stability theorem , has been previously used to compute saturation bounds in 2.5- @xcite and 3-layer @xcite models .",
    "in addition to considering more general model configurations than in these earlier works , we focus on the size of state space available for the growth of eddies in the region of parameter space where the models present discrepancies in their stability properties . also , unlike paret and vanneste ( 1996 ) , who computed numerical energy - norm bounds based on both arnold s first and second theorems , we derive analytical expressions for enstrophy - norm bounds based on arnold s first theorem .",
    "maximum normal - mode perturbation growth rates in the 3-layer model are also calculated and contrasted with those in the 2.5-layer model .",
    "the reminder of the paper has the following organization .",
    "section 2 presents the 3-layer model , from which the 2.5-layer model follows as a limiting case .",
    "normal - mode perturbation growth rates are computed in  3 , along with an exposition of the main results of formal and nonlinear stability analyses .",
    "nonlinear saturation bounds are then derived in  4 .",
    "we want to remark that the number of basic state parameters that define a 3-layer flow is too large to be explored in full detail . to facilitate the analysis we reduce in some cases this number by fixing certain parameters to values that can be taken as `` realistic , '' because of being found appropriate for a region of the ocean mainly dominated by the anec , which is a good example of a major zonal current .",

    "the maximum perturbation growth rates associated with these instabilities are larger than those of the 2.5-layer model ( olascoaga , 2001 ) . in the following section we will see , however , that the fraction of the total enstrophy of the system available for eddy - amplitude growth can be much smaller in the 3-layer model than in the 2.5-layer model for certain unstable basic states .",
    "when a basic state is unstable , a priori upper bounds on the finite - amplitude growth of the perturbation to this state can be obtained using shepherd s ( 1988 ) method .",

    "the latter is not always true in the 3-layer model case , however , since there is a possibility that a spectrally stable basic state could become unstable through eri .    three - layer surface - confined flows are susceptible to suffer more destabilization than 2.5-layer flows .",
    "however , the state space available , ( determined by the fraction of total potential enstrophy ) , for eddy - amplitude growth in the 3-layer model tends to be smaller than the space available in the 2.5-layer model , at least for certain basic state parameters .",
    "this is evident in the upper three panels of figure [ cotas ] .",
    "there is an overall tendency of the 3-layer model bound to decrease as @xmath51 increases .",
    "moreover , for a large set of parameters this bound reduces to only a small fraction of the total enstrophy of the system . in these cases ,",
    "the significance of the associated instabilities is relative . on the other hand , there are basic state parameters for which this fraction is not negligible . as an example not shown in the figure , for @xmath134 and @xmath135 , which are appropriate for a region similar to the anec , the fraction of total enstrophy is about @xmath136 , which is not negligible .",
    "of course , when the upper bounds are not small enough , no unambiguous conclusion can be drawn about the significance of an instability .",
    "figure [ cotas ] also shows that the 3-layer model bound can be significantly small for certain potentially eri unstable flows ( cf .",
    "lower two panels in the figure ) .",
    "this also allows us to make an unambiguous assessment of the significance of these type of instabilities in the sense that they can be certainly negligible for some basic state parameters .    before closing this section ,",
    "two points deserve additional discussion .",
    "first , the result that the bounds for the 3-layer model with a very thick deep layer are smaller than the 2.5-layer model bounds in the region of parameters where the two models share similar instability properties might seem at odds with the fact that the 3-layer model is less constrained than the 2.5-layer model , which allows for the development of more unstable states .",
    "however , we believe that this result should not be surprising inasmuch as the space over which the minimization is carried out is larger in the 3-layer model than in the 2.5-layer model , which offers the possibility of finding tighter bounds ( cf .",
    "olascoaga , 2001 ) .",
    "second , paret and vanneste ( 1996 ) were not able to draw a conclusion on the significance of eri instability as in the present paper .",
    "these authors computed energy - norm saturation bounds , according to both arnold s first and second theorems , using numerical minimization algorithms .",
    "these bounds , whose analytical computation appears to be too difficult , were not found to minimize at basic state parameters for which eri instability is possible .",
    "the analytical minimization involved in the derivation of the enstrophy - norm of this paper has shown that the tightest bounds are obtained using stable basic states whose parameters have quite spread numerical values .",
    "the minimization thus requires to search for a solution in a considerably large space , making numerical computations extremely expensive .",
    "this might explain the difficulty of paret and vanneste ( 1996 ) to find tighter bounds for potentially eri unstable basic flows .",
    "a previous study showed that the quasigeostrophic baroclinic instability properties of a surface - confined zonal current may differ substantially between a 2.5-layer model and a 3-layer , if the former is considered to be a simplified 3-layer model with a very thick deep layer .",
    "for certain basic state parameters , the 2.5-layer model predicts nonlinear stability whereas the 3-layer model spectral instability .",
    "that study thus suggested that the effects of the deep ocean on the baroclinic instability of the upper thermocline layer of the ocean may be important for certain currents .    in this paper",
    "we have made further assessments of the importance of the deep ocean on upper baroclinic instability .",
    "we have achieved this by analyzing ( i ) maximum normal - mode perturbation growth rates and ( ii ) rigorous enstrophy - norm upper bounds on the growth of perturbations to unstable basic states , in both 2.5- and 3-layer models of baroclinic instability .",
    "the new results show that instabilities , which the 3-layer model predicts in the region of basic state parameters where the 2.5-layer model predicts nonlinear stability , appear to maximize their growth rates . at the same time , however , the saturation bounds tend to minimize in this same region of basic state parameters , thereby reducing the size of state space available for eddy - amplitude growth .",
    "moreover , for a large subset of parameters in the region , the latter reduces to only a small fraction of the total enstrophy of the system . in these cases",
    "we have been able to make unambiguous assessments of the significance of the associated instabilities in the sense that they can be certainly negligible .",
    "we close remarking that the important issue of making assessments of the accuracy of the saturation bounds as predictors of equilibrated eddy amplitudes is still largely open .",
    "this can not be addressed without performing direct numerical simulations .",
    "the importance of this subject relies upon the potential of the bounds in the architecture of transient - eddy parametrization schemes .",
