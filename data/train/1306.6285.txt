    "historical records indicate that canada lynx ( _ lynx canadensis _ ) were found in new york state ( nys ) , but were seen only rarely during most of the 20th century @xcite . between 1989 and 1992 ,",
    "no fewer than 80 lynx were captured in canada and released in the adirondack mountains of nys .",
    "each animal carried a radio - collar , so that survival and dispersal could be monitored .",
    "the lynx rapidly dispersed ; mortality during dispersal was high .",
    "lynx population density grew too low for successful reproduction , and the species is now considered extirpated in nys @xcite .",
    "generalizing the example , we envision restoration of a single species whose population dynamics depends on the density of each sex . before evaluating costs",
    ", we must identify those spatial distributions of the initial population that assure successful restoration .",
    "suppose that we initiate restoration with a single spatial cluster , within which individuals are distributed at a uniform density .",
    "then we must find the `` critical cluster '' size , the minimal area the species must occupy to sustain positive population growth .",
    "analysis of the critical - cluster criterion has advanced understanding of spatial systems in both physics @xcite and ecology @xcite . however , if ecosystem managers can vary initial densities according to location , non - uniform spatial distributions might reduce restoration cost . given multiple initial population distributions assuring sustained population increase ,",
    "the most preferred option should _ minimize _ cost .",
    "our study investigates how the minimum cost of successful restoration depends directly on spatial pattern , and how the optimal pattern depends on sex ratio , and on sex - specific mortality rates .    in this context , we model a species restoration as a spatially detailed , two - sex reaction - diffusion system .",
    "we optimize the initial densities and spatial distributions of the sexes to minimize the cost of restoring the species to its positive , stable ( homogeneous ) equilibrium density throughout a habitat .",
    "the prototype of such models is the fisher - kolmogorov equation @xcite @xmath0 which describes the dynamics of single - sex populations with logistic growth and diffusive dispersal .",
    "our model extends the basic reaction - diffusion framework to include sex - structured dynamics @xcite , where an allee effect @xcite generates an unstable fixed point between extinction and the habitat s carrying capacity .    in many natural and managed populations , _ per - capitum _ growth is reduced as density becomes small ; this is termed an allee effect @xcite .",
    "different behavioral , ecological and genetic mechanisms can induce an allee effect @xcite .",
    "low population density may diminish individual reproduction by reducing mate encounters , making prey capture more difficult , or by leaving individuals more susceptible to their own predators @xcite .",
    "allee effects will be amplified if dispersal into unoccupied habitat reduces local population density ; a sufficiently high dispersal rate can generate negative population growth , thwarting restoration @xcite .",
    "generically , the cost of restoration can be can defined as : @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the extent of the habitat , and @xmath3 is the population density at location @xmath4 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can consider a constant _ per - capitum _ cost ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "mathematically , the restoration cost , which we seek to minimize , is a functional of the initial population s spatial distribution .",
    "the constraint requiring population persistence can not be expressed analytically , since that would require solving the model s partial differential equations exactly .",
    "therefore , we develop a population dynamics with simple processes and easily interpreted parameters , and obtain the minimum cost with analytical and numerical techniques .",
    "we organize the rest of the paper as follows .",
    "first , we introduce our sex - structured population dynamics , and outline the analytic and numerical methods we employ in this paper . in the results section we conduct a systematic study of the restoration cost in multiple stages . starting with a simplified , single - sex version of our model",
    ", we derive an unstable , aperiodic stationary solution for the pde , resulting in a single - sex cost .",
    "we then continue with the sex - structured model and analyze the way restoration cost depends on model parameters , given a simple , constrained ( i.e. homogeneous ) initial distribution of individuals .",
    "thereafter , we relax the constraints in two steps , and study how the cost can be reduced as a result .",
    "finally , in the discussion we compare the minimum costs found in each stage , and conclude which approach yields the most economical restoration .",
    "our model s key parameters include the sex ratio at birth and sex - specific mortality rates .",
    "we assume that females and males disperse independently by homogeneous diffusion , and that males encounter females as a mass - action process , equivalent to random mating @xcite .",
    "the fraction of matings leading to successful reproduction is proportional to the unoccupied fraction of the environment , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "that is , the population grows in a self - regulated manner .",
    "hence , we have : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the local densities of females and males , respectively .",
    "diffusion rates are described by coefficient @xmath10 for females and @xmath11 for males .",
    "three parameters characterize the local dynamics : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , which denote the fraction of individuals born female , and density - independent mortality rates for males and females , respectively .",
    "note that while eqs .",

    "( note , however , that the rigorous derivation of such stochastic partial differential equations can be rather challenging @xcite . )    our model [ eq .",
    "( [ eq - model ] ) ] , with spatial detail and diffusion removed , is identical to that studied by tainaka et al .",
    "@xcite . in our earlier work @xcite",
    ", we briefly analyzed the above two - sex dynamics with diffusive dispersal , and found the critical radius ( hence , critical cluster size ) for an initial population s successful invasion of a two - dimensional habitat .",
    "while our reaction - diffusion model includes numerous simplifications for detailed application to particular species , nevertheless it exhibits the essential ecological characteristics of more complex two - sex models .",
    "hence , implications of our results for restoration will likely hold across a wide range of specific models",
    ".    we can transform eq .",
    "( [ eq - model ] ) to interpret it as a single - sex model by making the equations symmetric . to do so",
    ", we must let @xmath15 , restrict @xmath16 , @xmath17 and use the same initial - density distributions for both males and females .",
    "in this way , the two densities behave identically over time : @xmath18 , described by the following equation : @xmath19 this transformation bridges the single - sex and two - sex models ; using the constants in eq .",
    "( [ eq - simplemodel ] ) , we can directly compare results between models without rescaling parameters .",
    "note that the ( cubic ) local dynamics also retains an allee effect .",
    "our first approach to cost minimization selects suitable unstable stationary solutions of the pde model as initial population distributions , since we can derive them analytically for the single - sex model .",
    "these are special `` critical '' solutions , which transform to stable equilibrium solutions ( either persistence or extinction ) depending on a small perturbation .",
    "the cost associated with each stationary solution is found by numerical integration of the density profile ( i.e. , the area under the curve ) .",
    "we obtain the stationary solutions for the single - sex model by setting the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq - simplemodel ] ) to zero , and deriving a relationship between the stationary solution s local value and its derivative .    for the sex - structured model",
    ", we can not derive stationary solutions analytically .",
    "instead , we base our study on the model s critical limits of cluster size and density , which are directly related to the minimum cost of successful restoration . for a homogeneous initial spatial distribution with a specific population density",
    ", there exists a critical cluster size , the smallest spatial extent such that the given density achieves sustained positive growth .",
    "symmetrically , for a given cluster size , there is a critical initial density , the lowest density assuring sustained population growth . in both cases",
    ", the critical limit also corresponds to the minimum cost , since the cost is proportional to both cluster size and density .",
    "the exact , parameter - dependent values of these critical limits can not be derived analytically .",
    "instead , we use binary search across a range of possible values , accomplished by testing each value for successful restoration _ vs _ extinction .    we discriminate restoration from extinction by numerically integrating the model until it has converged to a global equilibrium .",
    "we use second - order finite difference discretization for spatial derivatives and explicit euler method for integration over time @xcite , with a sufficiently small time - step .",
    "integration stopped when all time - derivatives at all spatial coordinates were less than @xmath20 .",
    "finally , the cost is obtained by multiplying the initial density and the initial cluster size , and summed for males and females .",
    "next , we extend the uniform - density approach by allowing the initial cluster size to differ between males and females . in this case , we first calculate the critical cluster size for males at a fixed cluster size for females using binary search , resulting in a cost with respect to the given female cluster size",
    ". then , we use gradient descent on this cost function to minimize it with respect to female cluster size .",
    "note , that during the gradient descent we always change the female cluster size by one unit of spatial grid resolution , and we keep moving toward the negative gradient even if the local derivative is zero , because a small slope discretized with any grid can result in zero local gradients before reaching the actual minimum point .",
    "note also , that we strongly rely on the convexity of the cost function with respect to male and female cluster sizes .",
    "finally , we relax all constraints on the shape of the initial population distribution ; we optimize the spatially discretized shape for lowest cost under the constraint of successful restoration .",
    "discretization is essential because it allows us to express the cost as an @xmath21-dimensional function , instead of a functional , where @xmath21 is the size of the spatial grid .",
    "we use the same grid for shape discretization and numerical pde integration , for practical reasons . given the discretization , we use _ _ simulated annealing__@xcite for optimizing the shape function .",
    "this is essentially a monte carlo simulation , where random changes of the initial spatial distribution ( the shape function ) are accepted or rejected according to a specified acceptance probability function , such that the visited cost states have a boltzman - distribution characterized by a temperature - like parameter . as this parameter",
    "is lowered , the expected value of the cost is also lowered , eventually leading to the globally optimal , minimum cost state . for the specific steps of simulated annealing , see supporting information ( section s5 ) . in order to determine whether the constraint of successful restoration is satisfied we must numerically integrate the model at every monte carlo step . to reduce computational time , we accelerated the pde integration with gpgpu computation using cuda @xcite , which locates the global equilibrium of the pde in a fraction of a second , giving a total time for the simulated annealing in the order of a few hours .",

    "we will compare these costs with those found by the other two methods described in the following subsections .    as an interesting observation",
    ", we note that contrary to intuition , the period length of the stationary solution does not converge to zero as the solution curves approach @xmath35 , see supporting information ( section s4 ) .    for the sex - structured model [ eq .",
    "[ eq - model ] ] we can not derive unstable stationary solutions analytically . instead , we study the scaling of restoration cost through a numerical analysis of the critical cluster size .",
    "criticality of an initial cluster s size occurs when density reduction due to dispersal exactly balances the net effect of local natality and mortality ; supporting video s1 clearly shows this form of criticality in one dimension . in two dimensions",
    "the expanding population front s speed is reduced in proportion to the curvature of the cluster ; therefore , it affects the critical cluster size .",
    "to avoid confusing effects of curvature with other parameters impact on the critical cluster size and , hence , the minimum cost , we restrict our study to one - dimensional space .",
    "we begin our analysis of the critical cluster size by assuming a uniform spatial distribution .",
    "this is the most obvious choice , for its mathematical simplicity , and its plausible application ( _ e.g_. , an animal population surrounded by a fence before release can be modeled with a uniform spatial distribution ) .",
    "therefore , we have four parameters describing the distribution : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , which represent female density , male density , length of space occupied by females , and length of space occupied by males , respectively , at the initiation of restoration . we refer to this initial setup as `` rectangular '' , for its shape on a density _ vs _ location plot , and we shall refer to @xmath58 and @xmath59 as the cluster sizes of the initial population . the cost of the initial state is defined simply as : @xmath60 and it is minimized by using the critical cluster sizes @xmath61 and @xmath61 , for males and females , respectively .",

    "therefore , we systematically study dependence of critical clusters on all parameters .    as an initial step ,",
    "we analyze the dependence of critical cluster size on the diffusion coefficients .",
    "we anticipate that the critical cluster size , _",
    "i.e_. , critical length ( in one - dimensional space ) is proportional to the square root of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "similar scaling has been observed in two - dimensions when a population with a strong allee effect disperses by diffusion @xcite .",

    "in every case , initial ( spatially homogeneous ) densities are fixed : @xmath68 . ]",
    "figure [ fig - rc - diff](a , b ) shows that as long as we employ the same cluster size for males and females , the critical cluster size has the expected scaling behavior @xmath69 @xcite with respect to both male and female diffusion coefficients , even if one sex has a fixed diffusion coefficient .",
    "note that it is sufficient to study the dependence on the diffusion of one sex ( here , males ) while the other is fixed ( here , females ) , because of the symmetric construction of the model .",

    "[ fig - rc - diff](c , d ) indicates that fixing the cluster size of one sex while measuring the critical cluster size of the other sex with respect to diffusion coefficients yields non - trivial scaling .",

    "continuing our analysis of critical cluster sizes , we now assume that the critical cluster sizes are equal for both sexes ( @xmath70 ) ; we relax this constraint later .",

    "we can always find the minimum cost at a density somewhere in the vicinity of the positive stable fixed point of the system , but always slightly below it .",
    "we understand this by considering the dynamics just after initial introduction .",
    "if the population starts from its stationary density ( the stable , positive fixed point ) , then the local densities can only decrease , due to diffusive dispersal .",
    "however , if the initial density is lowered slightly , then the population has a chance to grow locally ( in particular , at the center of the cluster ) before the effects of diffusion reach it , while the eventual spread through the habitat remains the same .",
    "in essence , the cost is slightly lowered by handing over some of the spreading effort to growth dynamics . however , as fig .",
    "[ fig - vs - dens](b ) and fig .",

    "we can conclude that using the stationary densities as initial densities results in a sufficiently low cost . also , it provides a good choice of initial density based on model parameters , because the stationary densities depend on local dynamics , which in turn depend on model parameters .",

    "there is a range of permissible sex ratios , determined by the mortality rates ( see supporting information section s2 ) . within this range ,",
    "we define the optimal sex ratio @xmath73 as the value maximizing the equilibrium population density @xcite : @xmath74 note , that when the mortality rates are equal , the optimal sex ratio is @xmath75 , which is the parametrization , by definition , in the symmetric single - sex model .    .",

    "we find that the smallest cluster size assuring restoration corresponds closely to the optimal sex ratio , and that any small deviation from the optimal value causes a small increase in the critical cluster size [ fig .",

    "however , since the equilibrium population densities ( serving as initial densities ) decrease at suboptimal sex ratios ( by definition ; see fig .",
    "s1 in supporting information ) , the combined effect on the cost is non - trivial . as we see on fig .",
    "[ fig - vs - theta](b ) , restoration cost is minimized at approximately the same sex ratios minimizing the critical cluster size , indicating that the cluster size is more sensitive to biased sex ratios than to equilibrium densities . we also find that strongly biased sex ratios approaching the boundary of the stability range cause both cluster size and restoration cost to diverge .    to complete the relationship between the sex ratio minimizing restoration cost ( @xmath76 ) and the sex ratio that locally maximizes total equilibrium population density ( @xmath73 )",
    ", we compare the two quantities numerically .",
    "for the latter we have an analytical expression [ eq .",

    "but our cost - minimizing sex ratios have only limited precision , since for each value of @xmath12 we employed binary search to determine the critical cluster size , which , in turn , determines the cost .",
    "therefore we define a computational error bound on @xmath76 as the range of @xmath12 values that give critical cluster sizes within the error range of the minimum point s cluster size found by binary search .",

    "no further cost reduction can be achieved by allowing different cluster sizes for males and females . however , the relative advantage of sex - specific cluster size increases as the sex ratio deviates from the optimal value .",

    "it is also remarkable that the edges of the distributions go to zero very sharply ; this property develops without any influence inherent to the procedure .",
    "generally , the final result is an `` arch''-shaped distribution , with similar dimensions for females and males .",
    "note that as the sex ratio diverges from its optimal value , we observe a change in the sizes of the two initial population distributions and in the height of the peaks .",
    "these changes in spatial distributions occur roughly in proportion to the system s positive stationary densities [ fig .",

    "figure [ fig - mincost - compare ] compares minimum costs for each critical - cluster analysis ( i.e. , a single cluster size and sex - specific cluster sizes ) and costs incurred under simulated annealing .",
    "the critical cluster methods assume uniform initial population density within cluster bounds ; simulated annealing lets initial densities depend on spatial location .",

    "simulated annealing reduces restoration cost even further , but this advantage becomes significant only at strongly biased ( and biologically rare ) sex ratios , and implementing such spatial distributions in application could prove difficult , negating any cost advantage .",

    "we assume diffusive dispersal . many plants , and some animals , are `` diffusion limited , '' i.e. , the probability of long - distance dispersal is much lower than diffusion assumes @xcite .",
    "diffusion limitation implies that the criterion for expected positive growth demands greater propagation , relative to mortality , as dispersal limitation increases @xcite .",

    "our results suggest some considerations for species restoration .",
    "first , if a species disperses rapidly , individuals should be introduced concurrently , rather than serially .",
    "the initial population will increase only if the density exceeds any allee threshold , and continues to do so as individuals disperse .",
    "intuitively , the number / density of individuals introduced should increase with their dispersal rate .",
    "second , restoration cost declines little by introducing a species at a density below the ( estimated ) carrying capacity , unless the species disperses very slowly .",
    "third , a uniform spatial distribution within the initial populations s cluster adds little or no proportional cost over the ogive profile assumed in our simulated annealing method , as long as the sex ratio is close to optimal .",
    "spatial uniformity will likely prove more practical for most animals . given a uniform density close to the positive , stable equilibrium , restoration should focus on an initial population whose expanse exceeds the critical - cluster size , which ( again ) increases with dispersal rate .",
    "finally , adjusting frequencies of the sexes in an initial population may decrease the cost of successful restoration .",
    "of course , if one sex always limits population growth , an excess of that sex promotes restoration .",
    "if population growth depends on the density of each sex , introducing the sexes at different densities , or with different cluster sizes , may prove advantageous .",
    "sex ratio at birth may be unbiased , but mortality rates may differ between sexes , particularly during dispersal . adjusting the sex ratio at introduction to match frequencies at positive equilibrium densities",
    "should promote successful restoration , and reduce its cost .",

    "to move beyond the homogeneous distribution of the initial population as we seek to minimize cost , we need a method that finds the minimum cost in the domain of infinitely many possible distribution functions .",

    "we can determine the eventual persistence or extinction of an initial population only by running the simulation to global equilibrium , and this simulation requires a spatial discretization for the integration .",
    "we use the same grid to discretize the initial distribution function .",
    "further , we can assume that whatever initial distribution gives the minimum cost , it will have a finite support , therefore we can restrict the spatial extent of the distribution to a region in the center of the simulated space .",
    "if this restricted spatial domain includes @xmath146 grid points , we essentially reduce an infinitely detailed initial distribution to a @xmath146-dimensional function .    to find the minimum cost distribution , we use a global optimization method on the @xmath146-dimensional cost function , given the constraint that the population must persist .",
    "we use simulated annealing [ 4 ] , which has the ability to explore the multidimensional domain randomly without getting stuck in local minima .",
    "it slowly guides itself to the global minimum of the given function ( in our case , the cost function ) by lowering a control parameter , which slowly lowers the expected function values the random moves can take .",
    "eventually , a global minimum is found .",
    "simulated annealing requires an initial guess for the minimum - cost shape , and we must define a transition function that can transform any shape to any other in some finite number of iterations . at every step of the minimization ,",
    "the new shape is proposed by applying the transition function to the previous shape .",

    "eventually only changes that lower the cost are accepted , which finally moves the cost to a local minimum , but due to the gradual cooling and the stochastic nature of the procedure , this is also the global minimum with high probability .",

    "@xmath154 denotes the width of simulated habitat ; @xmath155 . in our simulations",
    ", we used the following values : @xmath156 , @xmath157 ( measured in discretized grid points ) , @xmath158 , which is above the allee threshold in every case we studied .    to minimize restoration cost with simulated annealing",

    "first , we determine the current spatial distribution s finite support : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a cutoff threshold set to @xmath161 .",
    "we use a randomized gaussian function as transition function to generate a new proposed shape .",
    "the mean of this function is chosen from @xmath162 $ ] interval .",
    "therefore , we allow for increasing the width of the density distributions , should the simulated annealing take that direction .",
    "the bell - shaped curve is defined by the following parameters : @xmath163 where @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 represent mean , amplitude , variance and sign , respectively , and @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 are uniform random numbers in the range @xmath172 .",
    "note , that amplitude and variance also depend on the current temperature , @xmath149 , which helps the minimization process by making smaller changes as @xmath149 is reduced .",
    "the transition function is defined as @xmath173 .",
    "\\label{eq - transfunc}\\ ] ] we then add @xmath174 to the current shape , resulting in a new proposed shape : @xmath175 we calculate shape distributions separately ( independently ) for both males and females . after the new shapes",
    "have been generated , the cost of the proposal is evaluated , and then accepted or rejected according to equation ( [ eq - accept ] ) .",
    "finally , the temperature is lowered using a simple cooling schedule : @xmath176 the iteration of these steps starts at @xmath177 and continues until @xmath178 .",
    "the constraint requiring successful restoration must be checked by running the simulation until convergence to a homogenous stationary state , persistence or extinction . if the newly proposed shapes result in extinction , the shapes are always rejected regardless of eq .  ( [ eq - accept ] ) .",
    "therefore , given that all previously accepted shapes resulted in survival , and given the convexity of the transition function ( gaussian ) , we know that when the newly proposed shapes increase the cost , then survival is guaranteed and there is no need to check it with a simulation .",
    "a test is only necessary when the cost is reduced .",
    "still , this means that we need to run a numerical simulation for almost every second monte carlo step , which is computationally very intensive . to improve performance , we use gpgpu computation ( using graphics processing units of video cards for general purpose computations ) with cuda [ 2 ] . using gpus",
    "can significantly improve the performance of pde integration [ 3 ] .",

    "<S> we model a spatially detailed , two - sex population dynamics , to study the cost of ecological restoration . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that cost is proportional to the number of individuals introduced into a large habitat . </S>",
    "<S> we treat dispersal as homogeneous diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the local population dynamics depends on sex ratio at birth , and allows mortality rates to differ between sexes . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , local density dependence induces a strong allee effect , implying that the initial population must be sufficiently large to avert rapid extinction . </S>",
    "<S> we address three different initial spatial distributions for the introduced individuals ; for each we minimize the associated cost , constrained by the requirement that the species must be restored throughout the habitat . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider spatially inhomogeneous , unstable stationary solutions of the model s equations as plausible candidates for small restoration cost . </S>",
    "<S> second , we use numerical simulations to find the smallest cluster size , enclosing a spatially homogeneous population density , that minimizes the cost of assured restoration . finally , </S>",
    "<S> by employing simulated annealing , we minimize restoration cost among all possible initial spatial distributions of females and males . for biased sex ratios , or for a significant between - sex difference in mortality , we find that sex - specific spatial distributions minimize the cost . </S>",
    "<S> but as long as the sex ratio maximizes the local equilibrium density for given mortality rates , a common homogeneous distribution for both sexes that spans a critical distance yields a similarly low cost . </S>"
