    "present knowledge about the most fundamental interactions indicate that parity is not conserved only in the weak interactions .",
    "such a nature of the weak interaction has been successfully probed in leptonic and semi - leptonic processes in high - energy experiments as well as in decay . in principle",
    "parity - violating ( pv ) aspects of the weak interaction can emerge in the pure hadronic processes too at both high and low energies .",
    "however our understanding of pv aspects of the weak interaction in the low energy region is still very poor even though more than 50 years have passed since the first observation of the parity violation in nuclear phenomena .",
    "nevertheless efforts in both experiments and theories have been continued .",
    "especially there has been significant progress in the low energy few - nucleon systems in the last three decades . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors wrote down the two - nucleon pv interactions in terms of @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-meson exchanges ( ddh potential ) , which contain seven weak meson - nucleon coupling constants .",
    "several pv observables in nuclear and hadronic processes have been calculated in terms of the ddh potential , and experiments were attempted to determine the values of the seven weak meson - nucleon coupling constants . in the last decade , calculations have been improved by the use of modern nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) phenomenological potentials such as argonne v18 , cd bonn and nijmegen93 .",
    "the relevant pv observables are the asymmetry in @xmath4 @xcite , the anapole moment of the deuteron @xcite , the polarization in @xmath5 @xcite , asymmetry in @xmath6 @xcite , longitudinal asymmetry in @xmath7 scattering @xcite .",
    "the pv observables were expressed in terms of the seven meson - nucleon coupling constants in the ddh potential .",
    "longitudinal asymmetries were measured with good accuracies at low energies @xcite .",
    "polarization in @xmath5 was measured in the late 70 s , but the experiments could provide only the upper limit @xcite .",
    "asymmetry in @xmath8 is under measurement at sns in oak ridge @xcite .",
    "there was an experimental trial for the deuteron anapole moment and @xmath6 .",
    "in the mean time , there was a reformulation in the theory for the pv interactions in the frame work of effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite .",
    "authors in @xcite derived the @xmath3 pv interactions from the theory with pions ( pionful theory ) and also without pions ( pionless theory ) . in the pionless theory where all the interactions are described in terms of contact terms only",
    ", it was shown that only five pv low energy constants ( lecs ) are independent after removing redundancy in the ddh potential @xcite .",
    "pv observables in the two - nucleon systems were recalculated with the eft pv potentials with and without pions @xcite .",
    "nowadays , effort to determine the pv lecs in the pionless theory is getting more attention in the field .",
    "asymmetry in @xmath6 is now becoming a potential candidate for the measurements in the two - nucleon processes .",
    "measurements have been proposed at jlab , spring-8 , shanghai synchrotron , and most recently at tunl .",
    "the aimed accuracy in the experiment at tunl is of the order of @xmath9 , with which one can obtain stringent constraint to pin down the values of either meson - nucleon coupling constants in the ddh potential or the pv lecs in the pionless theory . for precise determination of the coupling constants or lecs , however , it is necessary to have additional observables .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate polarization of the neutron in @xmath10 at low energies .",
    "there is a long history of discrepancy between theory and experiment for the polarization @xmath11 @xcite , which is a parity - conserving ( pc ) quantity .",
    "the problem with a pionless eft with dibaryon fields as auxiliary fields for the two - nucleon states was revisited @xcite . with dibaryon fields ,",
    "the calculation becomes simple and the convergence is especially efficient at low energies . in fact , we applied the theory successfully to various quantities such as the electromagnetic moments of the deuteron @xcite , @xmath12 capture at the big - bang nucleosynthesis energies @xcite , and @xmath13 fusion in the sun @xcite .",
    "also , we observed good agreement with other theoretical results for @xmath11 at low energies , but the discrepancy with the measurements still remains unresolved .",
    "@xmath11 is the polarization along @xmath14 axis ( convention for the coordinate system will be shown later ) .",
    "one can also think of the polarization along @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions , but they vanish if only pc interactions are considered . as will be shown in the following section , however , pv interactions cause non - zero contributions to @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "motivated by this simple observation , we calculate @xmath17 and @xmath18 with a pionless eft with dibaryon fields . assuming the first order approximation , the observables are obtained in the linear combination of pv lecs .",
    "since the values of pv lecs are completely unknown , we can not determine the numerical values of the polarizations .",
    "instead , the coefficients of the lecs can be calculated easily .",
    "we compare the resultant coefficients with those appearing in other pv observables such as the asymmetry in @xmath8 and the polarization in @xmath5 . by this comparison",
