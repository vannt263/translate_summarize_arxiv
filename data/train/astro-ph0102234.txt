    "observations of cosmic gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with the _ bepposax_satellite are providing a key contribution to theories about their nature . among the still unsettled questions , it is still not clear what are the mechanisms that produce the observed x ",
    "ray spectra and their evolution with time ( see , e.g. , frontera et al .",
    "2000 ) and what are the environments in which the grbs occur . in the context of the internal shock model , synchrotron radiation",
    "is generally expected to play an important role in the production of the observed grb spectra ( e.g. , tavani 1996 ) , but inverse compton can also give a significant contribution to them @xcite .",
    "also blackbody emission from the photosphere of the fireball @xcite is expected to contribute to the grb spectra , and inhomogeneities in the grb outflow , made of dense highly ionized metal  rich material , could give rise to broad spectral features , mainly k - edges @xcite .",
    "effects of photoelectric absorption and compton scattering from the circumburst material can modify the intrinsic energy spectrum of the grbs , with the introduction of absorption cut - offs and features , such as k - edges and emission lines @xcite , the presence of which has already been reported for some grbs @xcite .",
    "the separation of the intrinsic and external components is of key importance for establishing both the grb emission mechanisms and the properties of the grb environment .",
    "the gamma ray burst monitor ( grbm , 40700  kev , frontera et  al .",
    "1997 ) , and the two wide field cameras ( wfc , 228  kev , jager et  al .  1997 ) on board _ bepposax _  offer the opportunity to study the grb energy spectra in the 2700  kev energy band where the above components can be investigated ( e.g. , frontera et al .",
    "grb990712 was detected by the wfc no .",
    "2 and the grbm , showing in the 226  kev band the highest peak flux ever observed from a grb with _",
    "bepposax_. its position was promptly distributed to the astronomical community @xcite . follow  up observations with the _ bepposax_narrow field instruments were not possible due to sun constraints .",
    "observations were performed in the optical and radio bands .",
    "an optical transient ( ot ) with magnitude @xmath5 was discovered about 3  hrs after the event @xcite and its redshift is now well determined ( @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "grb990712 was detected on july 12 , 1999 starting on 16:43:02 ut @xcite .",
    "its position was determined with an error radius of @xmath7 ( 99% confidence level ) and was centered at @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "features and data available from grbm and wfcs have already reported in several papers ( e.g. , frontera et al .",
    "the effective area exposed to the grb was @xmath10  420  @xmath11 in the 40700  kev band and 37  @xmath11 in the 226  kev energy band .",
    "the background in the wfc and grbm energy bands was fairly stable during the event .",
    "the wfc spectra were extracted through the iterative removal of sources procedure ( iros , e.g. jager et al .",
    "1997 ) which implicitly subtracts the contribution of the background and of other point sources in the field of view .",
    "the count rate spectra were analyzed using the xspec v.  10 software package @xcite .",
    "the quoted errors for the spectral parameters correspond to 90% confidence .",
    "parameter values shown in brackets in table  1 have been fixed while fitting .",
    "figure  1 shows the time profile of grb990712 in four energy bands after the background subtraction . in all bands",
    "the grb shows a double  pulse structure , with an opposite behavior with energy of the first pulse with respect to the second : the peak flux of the first pulse increases with energy , while that of the second pulse decreases .",
    "the total duration of the event is about 20  s above 100  kev , but much longer ( about 40  s ) over the full 226  kev range .",
    "the spectral evolution of the event was studied by subdividing the grb time profile into 8 adjacent time intervals and performing an analysis of the spectrum of each interval ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we fit the spectra with either a power law ( pl , @xmath12 ) , a broken power  law ( bkn  pl ) or a smoothly broken power law ( bl , band et al .",
    "1993 ) , with photoelectric absorption ( wabs model in xspec ) .",
    "we assumed the galactic hydrogen column density @xmath13 ( @xmath14@xmath15 , dickey & lockman 1990 ) along the line of sight to the grb .",
    "for the first three time slices the fit was also performed leaving @xmath13 free to vary , but unfortunately @xmath13 was not constrained by the data .",
    "the fit results with a pl and a bl are given in table  1 .",
    "the results obtained with the bkn  pl model were similar to those obtained with the bl model and are not reported in table  1 .",
    "the spectra of the time intervals a and b , that correspond to the rise of the first pulse of the grb , and the spectrum of the interval d , that corresponds to the late tail of this pulse , are well fitted with a pl model .",
    "the bl model provides a good description of the spectra in the time intervals e and f , that correspond to the core of the second pulse , while the pl model again well describes the tail of the second pulse ( intervals g and h ) .",
    "however neither of these models provides a good description of the c spectrum ( @xmath16 for a pl and 16/5 for a bl ) .",
    "an excess with a significance level of about 3@xmath17 is evident around 4 kev .",
    "we investigated a possible instrumental origin of this anomaly with negative results .",
    "the wfc high - voltage , which is monitored every second , does not show any glitch in the interval c. given the accuracy of the readout ( which dominates over statistical noise ) this excludes gain changes higher than 0.01% .",
    "as in other grb detections , the wfc ratemeters all show the gamma - ray burst , even the ones that measure the illegal events , so we do not find any anomaly in this event .",
    "there are no dips or spikes of any sort , with a typical 3@xmath17 upper limit of 10% per second of measurement ( for a count rate of 700 counts s@xmath18 ) .",
    "there is one thermometer that shows a small change about 10  s before the burst , but all other measurements do not show anything out of the ordinary .",
    "the count excess in the grb spectrum of the interval c is also clearly visible ( see figure 2 ) in the ratio between the c count spectrum and the crab spectrum measured when this source was observed at an angular offset similar to that of grb990712 . for comparison ,",
    "figure 2 also shows the ratio with crab of the spectra measured in the intervals b and d , that precede and follow c , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , in the interval b the greater hardness of the grb spectrum ( photon index of @xmath191.4 , see table 1 ) than that of crab is apparent , while in the interval d the flatness of the crab ratio is consistent with the similar slope of the grb spectrum ( see table  1 ) with that of crab .",
    "a slight hint of the 4  kev excess in the spectrum also appears in the interval b , but it is not statistically significant .",
    "we point out that the crab ratio technique is adopted , to discover cyclotron lines in the spectra of x - ray pulsars ( e.g. , dal fiume et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the addition of a gaussian function or a blackbody spectrum ( bb ) to a pl model provides a good fit ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ) of the c spectrum .",
    "the best fit parameters of both models are reported in table  2 .",
    "for a better determination of the gaussian and bb parameters , the photon index @xmath22 of the pl model was kept fixed in the fit to the best fit value , that is given by @xmath23 or @xmath24 , depending on the model assumed for the feature , a gaussian or a bb model , respectively .",
    "the count rate spectrum of the interval c along with the best fit curve of the pl plus a blackbody model is shown in the top panel of the figure 3 , while the ratio between the count spectrum and the best fit power - law alone is shown in the bottom panel .",
    "the excess counts to the pl model are apparent .",
    "the evolution of the logarithmic power per photon decade ( the @xmath2 spectrum ) with the time from the grb onset is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the emission feature during the c interval is also apparent in this plot .",
    "the peak energy of the @xmath2 spectrum ( see table 1 ) is above our energy passband for the entire duration of the first pulse before suddenly becoming much lower ( @xmath3 kev ) from the beginning of the second pulse .    from the spectral fits we derived grb fluence and peak flux .",
    "the @xmath0ray ( 40700  kev ) fluence of the burst is @xmath25 , while the corresponding value found in the 210 kev band is @xmath26  , with a ratio @xmath27 , which is one of the highest values found with _",
    "the 2700  kev fluence is given by @xmath28  .",
    "the @xmath0ray peak flux is @xmath29  photons/@xmath11  s corresponding to @xmath30  , while the corresponding 210 kev peak flux is @xmath31  photons/@xmath11  s , corresponding to @xmath32  .",
    "from the redshift value of the optical afterglow of grb990712 ( @xmath33 , vreeswijk et al .",
    "2001 ) we can derive the x plus @xmath0ray energy released in the main event .",
    "assuming isotropic emission and a standard friedman cosmology ( @xmath34  km  s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 and @xmath35 ) , we get a 2700  kev released energy of @xmath36  erg .",
    "a sizeable fraction of this energy ( @xmath1920% ) is released between 2 and 10 kev . if we exclude the controversial case of grb980425/sn1998bw @xcite , grb990712 , in addition to showing the lowest redshift , is one of the least energetic events .",
    "grb990712 is marked by a peculiarity , which is noted here for the first time : the evidence of a broad emission feature at 4.4  kev , visible for 2  s , superposed on a power law continuum model .",
    "it can be described by either a gaussian profile with a full width at half maximum of @xmath193  kev or a blackbody emission with @xmath37  kev .",
    "if we assume the gaussian description , its centroid energy corrected for redshift ( @xmath38  kev ) is consistent with the energy of both an iron k fluorescence line and a iron recombination line .",
    "the interpretation of the emission feature as an iron recombination line is tempting , yet it makes some stringent demands on models : in fact , it requires much mass to be present within a few light seconds of the burst site , and for this mass to be moving at newtonian speeds .",
    "vietri et al ( 2001 ) derive the expected rate of photons for a narrow line : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the electron temperature ( units of @xmath42  k ) and the external radius of the line emitting medium , respectively , and @xmath43 is the iron mass present in this medium . for a broad line , such as",
    "that in grb990712 , the above value is an understimate by a factor of a few at most .",
    "assuming @xmath44 , @xmath45  cm and @xmath46 , comparison with table 2 shows that eq .",
    "[ main ] underestimates the observed line luminosity by four to five orders of magnitude ; inserting @xmath47 light seconds in the above equation yields the correct line luminosity , but for a total mass of iron of _ at least _",
    "assuming a realistic iron relative abundance ( at least 1% of the total mass , if what we are seeing is a type i sn , but more for any other hypothesis ) shows that we must explain the presence of at least @xmath49 of matter , at radii of a few light seconds , with none of this obstructing the line of sight .",
    "a more attractive possibility is that the observed feature is indeed thermal .",
    "though we can not definitely establish the thermal nature of the emission during the c interval , we wish to remark that the fireball model can account naturally for the presence of these features .",
    "in fact , as remarked by both paczynski ( 1986 ) and goodman ( 1986 ) hyper  relativistic expansion naturally leads to the liberation of a fully thermal spectrum , at the time when the fireball expansion becomes optically thin .",
    "the initial absence , and later disappearance , of the peak in question does not create difficulties within the fireball model : it can easily be ascribed to inhomogeneities in the time ",
    "structure of the relativistic wind , inhomogeneities which are in any case required in order to account for the burst sub ",
    "second variability .",
    "the fact that the peak , furthermore , appears during the tail of the first pulse of course makes the detection of the weaker thermal component easier ( see the very revealing fig . 2 of m@xmath50sz@xmath51ros and rees 2000 ) .",
    "if this spectral feature is indeed thermal in origin , within the fireball model there is quantitative , and independent check on this identification .",
    "in fact , the expected photospheric radius within the fireball model is @xcite @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the wind luminosity in units of @xmath54 erg s@xmath18 , @xmath55 is the number of electrons per baryon , and @xmath56 is the flow lorentz factor @xmath57 in units of @xmath58 . at this radius , the observed photospheric luminosity and temperature",
    "are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , where @xmath61 and @xmath62  kev , @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) being the initial bulk lorentz factor of the wind , and @xmath65 the mass , in units of 10  @xmath66 , of the rotating black hole , from 6 times the gravitational radius of which the fireball is assumed to start its expansion . by fitting simultaneously the observed temperature corrected for the redshift ( @xmath67  kev ) and the luminosity of the photosphere ( @xmath68 erg s@xmath18 ) , we find @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we thus see that the two independently determined observational parameters , blackbody temperature and luminosity , are well  fitted by values of the theoretical parameters , @xmath57 and @xmath53 , well within the expected range .",
    "assuming unit values for @xmath71 , @xmath65 and @xmath63 , @xmath53 results to be about 100 times higher than the estimated 2700  kev luminosity ( @xmath72  erg s@xmath18 ) assuming isotropy .",
    "that would imply an efficiency of only 1% in the production of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "in addition to the transient feature , the event shows a spectral evolution that is not typical of other grbs observed with _ bepposax _",
    "@xcite : the peak energy @xmath1 of the @xmath2 spectrum ( see table  1 and figure  3 ) is constantly above our energy passband for the entire duration of the first pulse , while it takes a low value ( @xmath3  kev ) with the onset of the second pulse .",
    "this discontinuity can be the result of two successive electron acceleration episodes , giving rise to the first and the second pulses .",
    "the different peak flux behavior of the two pulses with energy , discussed in section 3 confirms this scenario .",
    "the emission feature is found only during the first acceleration event .",
