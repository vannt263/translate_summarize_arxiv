    "[ intro ]    many attempts have been done to find a wide but not too inclusive class of functions that can be defined `` special '' , where special means something more that `` useful '' , the old definition of turn  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the actual main line of work for a possible unified theory of special functions is the askey scheme that is based on the analytical theory of linear differential equations .",
    "it includes as special functions all those functions that are related with hypergeometric functions and their @xmath11-analogues @xcite . in this approach particular interest",
    "is related to the employ of integral transforms , in such a way , that the general hypergeometric function @xmath12 can be derived from @xmath13 by means of successive applications of laplace transform and its inverse .",
    "the use of general properties of this transform and , in particular , of the convolution theorem enables also to derive differential identities for the corresponding functions .",
    "however , a possible alternative point of view of the theory of the basic classes of special functions was established by employing considerations that belong to a field of mathematics seemingly quite far from them : the theory of representations of lie groups .",
    "this way was introduced by wigner  @xcite and talman  @xcite and later developed mainly by miller  @xcite and vilenkin and klimyk  @xcite . in this line ,",
    "previous papers by us , refs .",
    "@xcite , shown a direct connection between some special functions and well defined lie groups .",
    "the starting point of our work has been the paradigmatic example of hermite functions that are a basis on the hilbert space of the square integrable functions defined on the configuration space @xmath14 . besides the configuration basis @xmath15 , as well known in the algebraic discussion of the harmonic oscillator , a discrete basis @xmath16 related to the weyl - heisenberg group @xmath17 can be considered such that hermite functions are the transition matrices from one basis to the other  @xcite .",
    "the relevant point is that this scheme can be generalized from the hermite polynomials to all the orthogonal polynomials we have , up to now , considered : legendre and laguerre polynomials  @xcite , associated legendre polynomials and spherical harmonics  @xcite and jacobi polynomials as we show in this paper .    in the seminal work of 1948 truesdell introduced indeed the idea that a sub - class of special functions , called by him  familiar special functions \" , are defined by means of a set of formal properties  @xcite . in his spirit , we proposed in @xcite a possible definition of a fundamental sub - class of special functions , we called  algebraic special functions \" ( asf ) , that look to be strictly related to the hypergeometric functions and are constructed starting from algebraic properties .",
    "the experience of the cases studied in @xcite leads us to consider the following set of assumptions :    1 .",
    "a set of recurrence relations are defined on these asf that can be associated to a set of ladder operators that span a lie algebra .",
    "2 .   these asf support an irreducible representation of this algebra .",
    "3 .   a hilbert space can be constructed on these asf where these ladder operators have the hermiticity properties appropriate for constructing a unitary irreducible representation ( uir ) of the associated lie group .",
    "second order differential equation that define the asf can be reconstructed from all diagonal elements of the universal enveloping algebra ( uea ) and , in particular , the second orden casimirs of the subalgebras and of the whole algebra .    from these assumptions , we have that :    * applying the exponential map to asf different sets of functions can be constructed . if the transformation is unitary another algebraically equivalent basis of the hilbert space is obtained .",
    "when the transformations are not unitary , as in the case of coherent states , sets with different properties are found ( like overcomplete sets ) .",
    "* the asf are also a basis of an appropriate set of @xmath7 functions ( defined on real spaces ) and of an appropriate hilbert space functions ( in complex spaces ) .",
    "this , combined with the above properties implies that the vector space of the operators operating on @xmath7 ( or hilbert ) space functions is homomorphic to the uea built on the algebra .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that hermite , laguerre and legendre polynomials are asf such that the hermite functions support a uir of the weyl - heisenberg group @xmath17 with casimir @xmath18 , while laguerre functions and legendre polynomials are both bases for the uir of @xmath19 with @xmath20 . since hermite functions are a basis of square - integrable functions ( or wave functions ) defined on the real line , as well as laguerre functions on the semi - line and legendre polynomials on the finite interval  @xcite , all operators of the universal enveloping algebra ( uea ) are defined on the appropriate basis functions and the wave functions built on them . in other words , the spaces of linear operators acting on these @xmath7 or hilbert spaces are homomorphic to the uea ( i.e. , the algebra constructed on the monomials of the lie algebra generators ) of the corresponding lie algebra . of course , this implies that this is true also for the elements of the corresponding lie group that are contained in the uea .",
    "all these properties have been shown to not be restricted to the above mentioned 1-rank algebras ( and groups ) .",
    "indeed in @xcite associated legendre polynomials and spherical harmonics are shown to share the same properties .",
    "the underlying lie group is in both these cases @xmath21 that is of rank 2 like two , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , are the label parameters of these functions .",
    "here we discuss a further confirmation of this scheme , now related to the jacobi polynomials that also satisfy the required conditions to be considered asf and share the same properties .",
    "indeed they can be associated to well defined `` algebraic jacobi functions '' that support a uir of @xmath4 i.e. , a lie group of rank 3 like three are the parameters , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , of the jacobi polynomials @xmath0 .    the suggestion to consider the jacobi polynomials as candidates to asf",
    "is related to the well known relation between jacobi polynomials with @xmath26 and the associated legendre polynomials @xcite : [ jaa ] j_n^(,)(x ) = ( - 2)^ ( 1-x^2)^-/2 p^_n+ ( x ) that shows that the jacobi polynomials with @xmath27 are asf related to the lie group @xmath21@xcite . indeed , since the relation ( [ jaa ] ) can be read in terms of the notation introduced in @xcite as [ ab ] j_n^,(x ) = ( -1)^_n+^(x ) , where @xmath28 are the associated legendre functions , the resuls obtained for the associated legendre polynomials @xmath29 are easily rewritten for the jacobi polynomials with @xmath27 .",
    "we present here the generalization of the ladder operators of the jacobi polynomials for independent integer values of the labels @xmath30 and @xmath25 .",
    "obviously as jacobi polynomials depend from three parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 we have to look for an algebra of rank three . in the following it",
    "will be shown that this algebra exists and is @xmath31 in its real form @xmath6 .",
    "since the complete construction is complex it not will be presented here . however , because of the great interest of the jacobi polynomials in many areas of mathematics and physics , a detailed description will be published elsewhere .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ algebraicjacobifunctions ] is devoted to present the main properties of the algebraic jacobi functions ( ajf ) relevant for our discussion . in section",
    "[ sua(2)otimessub(2 ) ] we study the symmetries of the the ajf that keep invariant the parameter @xmath32 and change @xmath33 and/or @xmath11 .",
    "we prove that these ladder operators determine a @xmath34 algebra , that allows us to build up a family of uir of the group @xmath35 labelled by the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in section  [ su11groups ]",
    "we construct , by means of four new sets of ladder operators that change the three parameters @xmath43 and @xmath11 in @xmath44 , generating each of them a @xmath45 algebra to which infinitely many uir s of @xmath46  supported by the ajf  are associated .",
    "the complete set of ladder operators span a @xmath6 lie algebra and the ajf generate a uir of @xmath4 characterized by the eigenvalue of the quadratic casimir @xmath5 . in section  [ operatorsl2 ] the homomorphism between the space of the operators on the @xmath7 space and the uea of @xmath6",
    "is discussed .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusionssection ] , some conclusions and comments are included .",
    "[ algebraicjacobifunctions ]    the jacobi polynomials are defined in terms of the hypergeometric functions @xmath47 and pochhammer s symbol@xcite [ j ] j_n^(,)(x)=_2f_1 .    as shown in the following ,",
    "the set of parameters @xmath48 and the same jacobi polynomials are not directly related to the algebraic structure .",
    "thus , consistently with @xcite , we define three new discrete variables and include an @xmath49-depending factor .",
    "moreover , a peculiar property of the jacobi polynomials shared with the legendre polynomials   @xcite is that the standard form of the matrix elements of the algebra is not connected to an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space but to an orthogonal one where a residual weight is preserved ( see eqs .",
    "( [ ort ] ) and ( [ com ] ) ) .",
    "hence , we first introduce in the space of parameters the change from the integers @xmath50 to @xmath51 all togheter integers or half - integers @xmath52 or , equivalently , @xmath53 then , in a second and final step , we include a @xmath49-depending factor @xmath54 thus , the fundamental objects of this paper , that we call `` algebraic jacobi functions '' ( ajf ) , have the final form @xmath55    these new objects reveal additional symmetries hidden inside the jacobi polynomials ( [ j ] ) to be added to the well known @xmath56 .",
    "for instance , [ symmj ]    lll j_l^m , q(x)=j_l^q , m(x ) , + j_l^m , q(x)=(-1)^m+q j_l^-m ,-",
    "q(x ) , + j_l^m , q(x)=(-1)^l - q j_l^-m , q(-x ) , + j_l^m , q(x)=(-1)^l - m j_l^m ,- q(-x ) .",
    "furthermore these functions verify the normalization relations for @xmath33 and @xmath11 fixed    lll [ com ] _",

    "similar to the ones imposed in @xcite to the legendre polynomials and in @xcite to the associated legendre polynomials .",
    "note again that they are orthogonal but , like in the so(3,2 ) case , orthonormal only up to the factor @xmath57 .",
    "the jacobi equation @xmath58\\ , j_n^{(\\a,\\b)}(x)=0\\ ] ] rewritten in terms of these new functions @xmath59 and of the new parameters @xmath60 and @xmath11 becomes [ jacobiequation ] j_l^m , q(x)=0 .",
    "it is worthy noticing the symmetry under the interchange @xmath61 in the expressions and .    in the spirit of @xcite ,",
    "the starting point for the construction of the algebra associated to these algebraic jacobi functions is now the construction of the rising / lowering differential operators that allow to obtain from each ajf the contiguous ones differing by 1 or 1/2 in the value of the discrete variables @xmath60 and @xmath11 .",
    "the fundamental limitation of this approach is that the problem has been considered from the point of view of differential equations where the indices are considered as parameters @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the formulas from the indices in iterated applications must thus be introduced by hand .",
    "this problem has been taken into account in @xcite where a consistent vector space framework ( where the indices are related to discrete operators ) was introduced to allow the iterated use of recurrence formulas by means of operators .",
    "the parameters involved are thus eigenvalues of certain discrete operators acting on the space of the ajf .",
    "thus , in order to display the complete operator structure on the set @xmath62 we introduce , in consistency with the quantum theory approach , not only the operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 of the configuration space , such that @xmath65= -1\\ , , \\ ] ] but also three other operators @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 such that [ lmq ] l_l^m , q(x ) = l_l^m , q(x ) m j_l^m , q(x ) = m_l^m , q(x ) q j_l^m , q(x ) = q_l^m , q(x ) , i.e. diagonal on the jacobi functions and , thus , commuting between them @xmath69 = [ l , q ] = [ m , q ] = 0 .\\ ] ] hence , when we shall consider the whole algebra , all of them will belong to the corresponding cartan subalgebra",
    ". it will be proved later that the obtained representation of the corresponding group ( @xmath4 ) is unitary if the variables @xmath70 are such that @xmath71",
    "[ sua(2)otimessub(2 ) ]    we have now to introduce the action of the ladder operators on the set of the jacobi functions , @xmath62 , as differential - difference relations .",
    "we start from the differential - difference equations and the difference equations verified by the jacobi functions , a complete list of which can be found in refs .",
    "the procedure is laborious , and , as we said before , it will be reproduced in a more detailed way in a following paper . here",
    "we only sketch the simplest examples in order to enlighten the procedure .",

    "but if we rewrite them in terms of the algebraic jacobi functions @xmath59 they allow to define the operators [ adiferential ] a _ : = d_x + ( x m+q ) that act in the following way [ anodiferential ] a__l^m , q(x ) = ) j_l^m1 , q(x ) .",
