    "thus the allan deviation becomes ;    @xmath141    as expected , the allan deviation becomes infinite when the count rates on and off resonance are equal , while it scales with @xmath142 when @xmath102 is zero ( background free ) .",

    "in this paper we estimate the feasibility of performing high resolution microwave spectroscopy on selected transitions in methanol using a rabi - type molecular beam setup in combination with a femtosecond laser . we have adapted the belgi programme to calculate the stark effect for the different isotopologues of methanol .",
    "the calculated stark shifts are reasonably large , typically between -1 and 1@xmath93 in a field of 100kv / cm for the different rotational states .",

    "@xmath67-scrambling can be enforced by rapidly switching the second deflection field on entrance of the molecules  @xcite . from simulations ,",
    "we find that the differences in signal on or off resonance , @xmath111 , are in the range of @xmath146 for the selected transitions in , and slightly less for the two considered transitions in . in order to estimate the detection efficiency of methanol molecules using a femtosecond laser , we have performed test measurements in an existing molecular beam machine .",
