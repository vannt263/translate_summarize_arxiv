    "rare events caused by rare realization of impurities often govern the properties of random systems and play an essential role in their study .",
    "numerical computation of the probabilities of rare events is , however , computationally expensive .",
    "when the probability takes very small values , say , @xmath1 or less , it is virtually impossible to calculate the correct probability value by naive random sampling .",
    "recently , approaches based on dynamic monte carlo ( markov chain monte carlo )  @xcite have been shown to be useful for sampling rare events and calculating large deviations in the corresponding statistics .",
    "the novelty of the approach is that a dynamic monte carlo algorithm is used for calculating sample averages over configurations of impurities , instead of computing thermal averages .",
    "successful examples in physics include applications in spin glass  @xcite , diluted magnets  @xcite , and directed random walks in random media  @xcite . some references  @xcite also discuss applications in information processing and other engineering problems .    the aim of this paper is to apply the method to sample rare events in random matrices .",
    "random matrices have been a classical subject with a number of applications in physics and other fields  @xcite . specifically , large deviations in the maximum eigenvalue of random matrices is a subject of recent interest in various fields such as ecology @xcite , cosmology  @xcite , mathematical statistics  @xcite , and information compression  @xcite .",
    "the tail of the distribution of the maximum eigenvalue is important because it gives the probability of all eigenvalues being negative , which is often related to the stability condition of complicated systems  @xcite .    a well - known study by tracy and widom established the celebrated  1/6 law \"  @xcite on small deviations in the maximum eigenvalue of random matrices . on the other hand ,",
    "analytical studies  @xcite of large deviations give estimations of the tails of probabilities in special cases such as the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) and ensemble of random wishart matrices .",
    "however , the techniques based on the coulomb gas representation are difficult to generalize to ensembles with other distributions of the components .",
    "other results by mathematicians and physicists are also limited to special ensembles and/or give only the upper bound of the probabilities  @xcite .",
    "thus , an efficient numerical approach that enables exploration of extreme tails of density is necessary .",
    "we propose a method based on multicanonical monte carlo  @xcite as a promising approach to the problem .",
    "as we will show in this study , quantitative results are obtained in examples of sparse random matrices and matrices whose components are subject to the uniform density .",
    "a similar method is used in  @xcite to calculate large deviations in the _ growth ratio _ of matrices .",
    "the paper  @xcite , however , focuses on applications in numerical analysis and does not compute large deviations in the largest eigenvalues .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : multi ] , we summarize the multicanonical monte carlo algorithm . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dev ] , we discuss how multicanonical monte carlo is used to calculate large deviations and show the results of numerical experiments on the tails of the distribution of the largest eigenvalues . sec .",
    "[ sec : prob ] covers the computation of the probability that all eigenvalues are negative ; as noted above , this is a typical application of the proposed method . in .",
    "[ sec : sparse ] , sparse matrices are treated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] , concluding remarks are given .",
    "let us summarize the idea of multicanonical monte carlo  @xcite . assuming the energy @xmath2 of a state @xmath3 , our task is to calculate the density @xmath4 of states defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dirac @xmath6-function , and @xmath7 denotes a multiple integral in the space of states @xmath3 .",
    "a key quantity of multicanonical monte carlo is the weight function @xmath8 of the energy @xmath9 . performing dynamic monte carlo sampling with the weight @xmath10 , we modify @xmath8 step - by - step until the marginal density @xmath11 of @xmath9 is almost flat in a prescribed interval @xmath12 . the initial form of @xmath8 is arbitrary , and we can start , for example , from a constant function .",
    "several methods are proposed for optimizing a univariate function @xmath8 , among which a method proposed by wang and landau  @xcite is most useful and used in this paper .",
    "after a weight function @xmath13 that gives a sufficiently flat @xmath11 is obtained , we compute an accurate estimate @xmath14 of @xmath11 by a long simulation run with the weight @xmath15 .",
    "then , @xmath4 is estimated by the relation @xmath16    this simple algorithm has significant advantages over conventional methods for estimation of @xmath4 .",
    "first , it realizes accurate sampling of tails of @xmath4 without estimating densities in the high - dimensional state space of @xmath3 .",
    "second , when we include the region of @xmath9 with large values of @xmath4 in the interval @xmath12 , the mixing of dynamic monte carlo is dramatically facilitated .",
    "this `` annealing '' effect is the reason that multicanonical monte carlo is successfully used to calculate thermal averages at low temperatures in the studies of spin glass  @xcite and biomolecules  @xcite .",
    "an essential observation in the present approach is that the energy @xmath9 in multicanonical monte carlo need not be an energy in the ordinary sense .",
    "that is , we can substitute for @xmath9 any quantity for which we are interested in its rare fluctuations or large deviations from the average ; similar approaches to other problems are found in  @xcite .    in this study , we regard the maximum eigenvalue @xmath17 of a matrix @xmath3 as a fictitious `` energy '' of the state @xmath3 . also , we can introduce an underlying density @xmath18 that gives the probability of @xmath3 under random sampling .",
    "while @xmath18 is the uniform density in statistical mechanics , @xmath18 in the present case characterizes an ensemble of matrices .",
    "hereafter , we assume the factorization @xmath19 .",
    "the normalized density @xmath20 of the states is written as @xmath21 where we replace @xmath2 in  ( [ ddd ] ) with @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath20 is simply the probability distribution of @xmath22 , whose extreme tails we are interested in .    now",
    "the application of multicanonical monte carlo is straightforward .",
    "we employ a metropolis - hastings algorithm to generate samples according to the weight @xmath23 .",
    "a single component @xmath24 of the random matrix @xmath3 is chosen and changed at each step ; in ensembles of symmetric matrices , @xmath25 should also be changed if @xmath26 , which is necessary to keep the symmetry of the matrix . the candidate @xmath27 of @xmath24 is generated according to the proposal density @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the current value of @xmath3 ; @xmath27 is accepted if and only if the metropolis ratio @xmath30 is smaller than a random number uniformly distributed in @xmath31 $ ] . repeating this procedure ,",
    "the function @xmath32 is tuned by the method of wang - landau  @xcite .",
    "once a weight function @xmath33 that gives a sufficiently flat @xmath34 is obtained , we estimate @xmath20 using the formula @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the density of @xmath22 estimated by a long run with the fixed weight function @xmath33 .    a simple choice of the proposal density is @xmath37 , which results in a simple form of the metropolis ratio @xmath38 however",
    ", this choice may not be adequate in some cases where the support of the densities @xmath39 is not finite , because very large deviations in an element @xmath24 can be relevant for large deviation of the largest eigenvalue .",
    "an alternative choice is to use @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is an even function ; hereafter we will call an algorithm using this proposal density as a _ random walk scheme_. in this case , the metropolis ratio is given by @xmath42    we test the proposed method with the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) ; goe is an ensemble of real symmetric matrices whose entries are independent gaussian variables  @xcite .",
    "the householder method is used to diagonalize the matrix in each step ; it is also used in other examples in this paper .",
    "we employ two different forms of the proposal density : ( 1 )  @xmath37 and ( 2 )  @xmath43 ; the latter is a special case of the random walk scheme , where @xmath44  .",
    "no significant difference between ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is seen in our study .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , a result estimated with the proposed method with @xmath37 is compared with the corresponding result of naive random sampling .",
    "the total number of matrix diagonalizations is @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 ; they are the same in both of the proposed method and naive random sampling . in the proposed method , two third of them",
    "are used to optimize the weight , while the rest is used to calculate the estimates .",
    "we confirmed that modification factors in the wang - landau method are sufficiently close to unity at the end of the weight optimization . for @xmath46",
    ", we also apply the random walk scheme @xmath43 and obtain the same result , but the computational time increases . the results in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] show that the proposed method enables us to estimate the tails of the density down to @xmath49 , which is scarcely sampled by the naive method .     in goe .",
    "results of the proposed method and a naive random sampling method are compared for @xmath46 and @xmath50 .",
    "both almost overlap with @xmath51 scaling . the symbols and @xmath52 appear only in the region where naive random sampling gives meaningful results . ]",
    "the proposed strategy also allows us to calculate the probability @xmath53 that all eigenvalues of a random matrix are negative , which is important in applications in a variety of fields  @xcite . using the relation @xmath54 , this probability is calculated by @xmath55 here we assume that the density @xmath20 of the maximum eigenvalue is estimated in an interval @xmath56 $ ] by the proposed method . the probabilities @xmath57 and @xmath58 are also assumed to be negligibly smaller than @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .    the probability that all eigenvalues are positive can also calculated with a similar way ; it coincides with the probability that all eigenvalues are negative when the distribution of components is symmetric with respect to the origin .",
    "first , we test the proposed method with goe , where the asymptotic behavior of @xmath53 for large @xmath61 is given by dean and majumdar @xcite as @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "this expression is derived by interpreting the eigenvalues as a coulomb gas , a method that obviously does not apply general distribution of components of matrices .    confirming the result by numerical methods is difficult because we should sample very rare events to estimate the tails of the distribution .",
    "dean and majumdar  @xcite ( and aazami and easther  @xcite ) provided numerical results by naive random sampling , but their results are limited to small @xmath61 , such as @xmath64 in  @xcite ( @xmath65 with an additional assumption  @xcite ) . dean and majumdar also did numerical computation up to @xmath66 based on the coulomb gas representation ; their computation does not , however , provide an independent check to the theory and can not be generalized to an arbitrary ensemble .",
    "[ fig : exceed0_goe ] shows our numerical results for goe . we can treat matrices up to @xmath67 , which is not treated by naive random sampling .",
    "here we use the random walk scheme @xmath43 and the total number of matrix diagonalizations is @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "the results for @xmath72 coincide with those by naive random sampling .",
    "they are also consistent with the fit @xmath73 of the numerical results calculated in  @xcite with the coulomb gas representation .",
    "hence , probabilities as tiny as @xmath0 are estimated by the proposed method and agree well with the known results .     for goe versus size @xmath61 of the matrices .",
    "the results of the proposed method ( + ) and the naive random sampling method ( @xmath74 ) are shown .",
    "the results of naive random sampling are available only in the region @xmath75 .",
    "the curve indicates a quadratic fit to the results with the coulomb gas representation given in dean and majumdar@xcite . ]",
    "next , to show the flexibility of the proposed method , we calculate the probability @xmath53 for an ensemble of real symmetric matrices whose entries are independently distributed with the uniform distribution @xmath39 defined by @xmath76 hereafter , the value of the parameter @xmath77 is unity , which fits the variances of the components to those of the goe . results of the proposed method for this ensemble are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : exceed0_uniform ] .",
    "the proposal density @xmath37 is used .",
    "total number of matrix diagonalizations is @xmath70 for each value of @xmath61 ; two third of which are used to optimize the weight .",
    "fitting the results yields asymptotic behavior of the probability , @xmath78 for large @xmath61 , where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exceed0_uniform ] , these probabilities significantly differ from that for the goe with the same variance .     for an ensemble of matrices",
    "whose components are uniformly distributed .",

    "the results of naive random sampling are shown for @xmath82 .",
    "the solid curve indicates the probability for the goe with the same variance . ]",
    "we also study ensembles of sparse random matrices .",
    "once the matrices become sparse , the coulomb gas approach is not applicable even in gaussian cases .",
    "the proposed approach allows us to calculate the probability @xmath53 in these cases . in this section ,",
    "we use the proposal density @xmath37 , but some of the results are also checked by random walk schemes .",
    "various ways of defining sparse random matrices are available . among them , we consider two types of definitions in this study .",
    "the first is as follows : ( 1 )  the matrix is symmetric . ( 2 )  all diagonal entries are @xmath83 .",
    "( 3 )  nonzero off - diagonal entries in the upper half of the matrix are mutually independent gaussian variables with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "( 4 )  total number of nonzero entries is fixed at @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the average number of nonzero entries per row .",
    "( 5 )  the positions of nonzero off - diagonal entries in the upper half of the matrix are randomly chosen .    the total number of nonzero components should be preserved with this definition .",
    "hence , the single component update in previous sections is replaced by a trial of exchanging zero and nonzero components with resampling of the nonzero component .",
    "other parts of the algorithm remain essentially the same .",
    "an example of the density @xmath20 computed by this modified method is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : old_sparse ] .     in a case of sparse random matrices .",
    "the first definition is applied ; results of the proposed method and the naive random sampling method are compared for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the symbol appears only in the region where naive random sampling gives nonzero results . ]",
    "the probability @xmath88 that all eigenvalues are negative is also successfully calculated by this algorithm for @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exceed0_sparse ] .",
    "these results indicate that for sparse random matrices , the probability @xmath91 behaves as @xmath92 for large @xmath61 , where the estimated values of the constants @xmath93 are @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 for @xmath97 , and @xmath90 , respectively .     for an ensemble of sparse random matrices estimated by the proposed method .",

    "however , if we plot the probability @xmath88 with the number @xmath101 of nonzero components instead of the size @xmath61 , the dependence is linear in all examples . because @xmath102 in a sparse case and @xmath103 in a dense case , the obtained results are naturally explained .",
    "the definition of sparse random matrices most frequent in the literature  @xcite differs from that given above . here",
    ", a second definition of sparse random matrices is given by assigning the probability @xmath104 to all components @xmath105 , where @xmath6 and @xmath106 denote dirac s delta function and a gaussian density with zero mean and unit variance , respectively ; each component is assumed to be an independent sample from this distribution .    in this case , all components are mutually independent and the modification for keeping the number of nonzero components is not necessary . however , since the diagonal elements can vanish , singular behavior of the density @xmath20 of states appears at @xmath107 , which affects the efficiency of the proposed method .",
    "fortunately , when we are interested in @xmath88 , this difficulty is easily treated ; we use the fact that the condition that all diagonal elements are negative is a necessary condition for . by using this condition ,",
    "the following two - stage method is introduced .",
