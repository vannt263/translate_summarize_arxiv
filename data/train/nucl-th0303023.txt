    "response of a many - body system to external fields provides various information about intrinsic dynamics of the system .",
    "one of the efficient approaches to get a deep insight into a nuclear structure is to study a response of a nucleus to an external coriolis field . in particular",
    ", we can trace the interplay between single - particle and collective degrees of freedom by studying a rotational dependence of the kinematical and dynamical moments of inertia . in its turn",
    ", these quantities are benchmarks for nuclear microscopic models , that allow to understand main features of a nuclear field . for example , the importance of pairing correlations , introduced in nuclear physics by bogoliubov @xcite and bohr , mottelson and pines @xcite in an analogy with the correlations in superconductors , had been recognised first in the description of nuclear inertial properties @xcite .",
    "the kinematical moment of inertia is described quite well within the cranking approach , for instance , in the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov and non - relativistic density - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory with gogny forces ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , there is a systematic discrepancies between those theories and experiment with regard of the dynamical moment of inertia .",
    "it is quite desirable to understand the main source of discrepancies between experiment and theory , since the above approaches represent state of art of nuclear structure studies .",
    "it is well understood that the two - body correlations are important for a correct description of the moments of inertia ( see discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "one of the systematic ways to include these correlations is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) based on a self - consistent solution of the cranking mean field equations @xcite .",
    "this enables one to also restore symmetries broken on the mean field level ( see textbooks @xcite ) .",
    "practical realisation of these aspects has been done recently in a cranking harmonic oscillator model with a residual quadrupole ",
    "quadrupole interaction @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the thouless - valatin moment of inertia @xcite ( which , in general , contains belyaev @xcite , migdal @xcite and other terms ) calculated in the rpa is equivalent to the dynamical moment of inertia calculated in the mean field approximation @xmath1 here @xmath2 denotes the rotational frequency , @xmath3 is a self - consistent solution of the mean field equations and @xmath4 is a total mean field energy in the rotating frame .",
    "quantum oscillations around the mean field solutions provide the additional contribution to the total energy .",
    "how such a quantal effect can be obtained within the rpa for the case of rotating systems is generally described in  @xcite .",
    "however , the practical application of the rpa in rotating deformed nuclei is a demanding numerical task .",
    "therefore , the influence of quantum fluctuations on the moment of inertia is till now scarcely studied . with regard of the easier case of pairing fluctuations",
    "more extensive investigations were performed ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . the first attempt to incorporate the pairing and quadrupole oscillations @xcite was done in a restricted configuration space and the self - consistency between the residual interaction and the mean field",
    "was not taken into account . a self - consistent analysis carried out in a simplified model",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the quantum correlations modify the thouless - valatin moment of inertia .",
    "therefore , there is a strong motivation to understand the role of quantum correlations in realistic calculations for inertial properties .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study exclusively the influence of shape vibrations on the angular momentum and on the moment of inertia .",
    "starting from the self - consistent cranking mean field calculation the total binding energy as a function of the rotational frequency has to be calculated up to rpa order , i.e. with inclusion of the rpa correlation energy .",
    "our calculations are based on separable qq - forces as an effective interaction .",
    "the mean field part of such calculations could be carried out with more advanced effective interactions like e.g. skyrme or gogny type forces .    however , the rpa correlation energy is not feasible for non - separable forces because of the too large configuration space needed for the cranking model .",
    "in addition , the problem of spurious solutions in the rpa calculations for the state of art effective interactions is silently avoided in the literature even for a zero rotational frequency . in other words ,",
    "again the question arises about a consistency between a mean field calculations and the rpa contribution for those type of forces . on the other hand ,",
    "the qq - forces are the most important interaction term for inducing nuclear deformation and rotational excitations . the mean field plus rpa calculations with the qq - forces based an a realistic cranking mean field potential with a spin - orbit coupling are by no means trivial .",
    "as we shall describe ( see below ) such calculations can be executed in different ways which enable us study specific properties of these forces and their effects in more detail .",
    "we will consider the following versions of the qq - model : + ( i ) the qq - forces with a full n - mixing of oscillator shells ( @xmath5 ) ; + ( ii ) the qq - forces without n - mixing ( @xmath6 ) which is the commonly used a qq - model ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; + ( iii)the double - stretched qq - forces with the volume conservation constraint  @xcite .",
    "+ by comparing results of the various treatments ( i - iii ) provides new insights in the nature of both the qq - forces and their influence onto the rotational properties . because of the schematic character of the qq - forces our investigations are merely an exploratory approach to the influence of quantum shape fluctuations upon rotational properties rather than a quantitative description of experimental data .",
    "the latter would require more extensive numerical efforts that are not intended in this paper .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce our mean field and rpa models .",
    "the influence of the volume conservation constraint on the rpa correlations is discussed in sec .",

    "hereafter , any isospin index is omitted .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath23 , equation  ( [ eq : qq1 ] ) is , of course , formally the same expression for all the versions ( i - iii ) of the qq - model described in the introduction .",
    "what is different concerns the particular treatment of the q - operator ( n - mixing or not and stretching transformation ) , the adjustment of the spherical oscillator frequency , @xmath24 , to account for the volume conservation condition and the adaption of the strength parameter @xmath25 .",
    "this is because the rotational invariance of the total hamiltonian is required for a clean treatment of the angular momentum conservation within the rpa @xcite .",
    "we consider the routhian @xmath26 to describe the rotational properties of the system . here",
    "@xmath27 is the angular momentum component about the z - axis .",
    "note that the cranking term in @xmath28 does not change the exact wave functions but only fixes the angular momentum about the quantisation axis ( z ) .",
    "the relevant mean field part of the routhian @xmath29 is originated from the hamiltonian @xmath30 in equation ( [ eq : qq1 ] ) .",

    "@xmath78 holds , the corresponding relation in the rpa order @xmath79 is taken only as a reasonable approximation to the relation between the exact energy and the angular momentum .",
    "in fact , it is not only a very difficult task to calculate numerically the rpa expectation value @xmath80 .",
    "this calculation sensitively depends also from the validity of the qba itself which raises another problem @xcite . however , the use of the total routhian and rotational frequency as the appropriate variables to determine the angular momentum of the system is consistent with our numerical calculations . + the proper definition of the angular momentum within rpa is a known problem which was controversially discussed by several authors .",
    "we mention below some important points of these discussions .",
    "+ assuming that the rpa expectation value of the angular momentum in the yrast state is @xmath81 reinhardt proposed to use the equations  ( [ qam ] ) and  ( [ ang1 ] ) to define the quantisation condition for the angular momentum ( see discussion in  @xcite where the rotation axis is chosen to be x ) . since in the mean field approximation",
    "@xmath82 @xcite , we obtain from the above equations the following quantisation condition @xmath83 according to reinhardt , the smallness of the contribution of the rpa modes @xmath84 to the value of the angular momentum in the yrast state could be used as the validity criteria for the self - consistent cranking model .",
    "it should be pointed out that marshalek raised the question about the validity of equation ( [ ang ] ) ( see discussion in  @xcite where the rotation axis is @xmath85 as well ) .",
    "he assumes that the mean field value of the angular momentum in the yrast state is @xmath86 which should be preserved in the rpa order too .",
    "he proposed to use the energy and the angular momentum as the appropriate variables to analyse the rotational properties .",
    "considering the cranking hamiltonian up to the second order of rpa , he proved that all conservation laws are restored ( see sec.4.1 in  @xcite ) .",
    "note that to prove all conservation laws it was important to keep the second order of the cranking term @xmath87 in the cranking hamiltonian as well . from this point of view , we would find the contribution of the second order term of @xmath88 operator to the expectation value @xmath89 ( see discussion in  @xcite ) , which is inconsistent with marshalek s assumption .",
    "furthermore , the total energy in  @xcite and  @xcite is a sum of the mean field energy @xmath90 defined in the _ lab _ frame whereas the rpa correlation energy is defined in the _ rotating _ frame .",
    "marshalek assumed that the rpa frequencies in the _ lab _ and _ rotating _ frame are the same .",
    "this leads to an inconsistency which becomes obvious if we consider a rotation about a symmetry axis . in this case",
    "the rpa states are characterised by the projection of the angular momentum upon the symmetry axis because @xmath91=\\lambda\\hat{o}^\\dagger_\\lambda $ ] with @xmath92 being the value of the angular momentum carried by the phonons along the @xmath68 axis .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath93= [ \\hat{h}_{\\rm rpa}-\\omega \\hat{j}_z , \\hat{o}^\\dagger_\\lambda ] = ( \\tilde{\\omega}_{\\lambda}-\\lambda \\omega ) \\hat{o}^\\dagger_\\lambda= \\omega_{\\lambda}\\hat{o}^\\dagger_\\lambda\\ ] ] this equation explicitly demonstrates that the rpa eigenfrequencies in the _ lab _ frame @xmath94 are different from the rpa eigenfrequencies in the _ rotating _ frame @xmath95 if the rpa modes carry angular momentum ( see details and discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , considering equations  ( [ qam ] ) and  ( [ ang1 ] ) to be a suitable relation between the exact energy and the angular momentum and knowing the rotational dependence @xmath96 of the total energy , it enables us to calculate the angular momentum @xmath97 by the derivative @xmath98 and , subsequently , the dynamical moment of inertia as the second derivative @xmath99 in practise the differentiations are numerically obtained with finite differences @xmath100 as indicated in the above equations .",
    "hereafter , we denote the angular momentum @xmath77 calculated in accordance with equation ( [ eq : qvib ] ) as @xmath101 .",
    "the rpa solution @xmath102 that contributes to the total angular momentum by @xmath103 , is very sensitive to numerical inaccuracies and to the limits of the configuration space in the calculation .",
    "in fact , at small but nonzero rotational frequencies the spurious solution at zero and the solution at the rotational frequency get mixed up because of numerical inaccuracies .",
    "the rotational solution will then no longer be exactly at @xmath2 .",
    "since the angular momentum is calculated as the derivative , these errors can lead to large erratic contributions to the angular momentum .",
    "we avoid such errors by explicitly finding the rotational solution and subtracting from the rpa energy .",
    "the missing term is then replaced by @xmath104 .",
    "the rotational solution can be identified by its collective nature and large overlap with the @xmath105 operator to which it should be identical if the solution was found exactly .",
    "this method is applicable when the level density is low , which is satisfied when @xmath106 mev . at larger @xmath107 the rotational and",
    "the spurious solution decouple in a numerically stable way and the solution at the rotational frequency is found with a high accuracy . to calculate the rpa energy  ( [ eq : erpa ] )",
    "it was crucial to apply the contour integral method developed in  @xcite .",
    "it is important to use a large enough configuration space in the calculations which include mixing of different @xmath108-shells . to reduce the number of @xmath108-shells needed in the calculation we always transform the matrix elements into the stretched basis",
    "in this section we focus our analysis on the contribution of the rpa correlations to the self - consistent mean field solution",

    "we start with the version ( i ) of the qq - model ( @xmath111 shell mixing is included ) and without the volume conservation constraint .",
    "the self - consistent mean field solutions of the routhian , equation ( [ eq : routh ] ) , are found from the relations @xmath112 where , as usual , the contributions of exchange terms are omitted .",
    "two systems are considered : ( a ) the lighter nucleus n = z=14 with the self  consistent deformation @xmath113 at @xmath114 and ( b ) the nucleus n = z=76 defined with the corresponding set @xmath113 at @xmath114 by choosing the appropriate strength @xmath25 for each system .",
    "the largest @xmath108-shell included in the calculation is @xmath115 in ( a ) and @xmath116 in ( b ) .",
    "it will be seen that both systems behave qualitatively similar with respect to the rotation . by searching for the energy minimum for finite rotational frequencies",
    "the self - consistent mean field solutions are found .",
    "this minimisation makes also sure that the rpa will restore the rotational invariance .",
    "the mean field angular momentum for these systems calculated by means of equation  ( [ eq : qvib ] ) is shown at figs .  [",
    "fig : eom2a14 ] ,  [ fig : eom2a76 ] .",
    "it is proportional to the rotational frequency @xmath2 .",
    "this means that our system even if the deformation is changing with the rotation gets an approximately constant moment of inertia  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the rpa correlations , we obtain a substantial decrease of the total energy @xmath75 and also a dependence of the rpa angular momentum @xmath101 on @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath117 .",
    "the dynamical moment of inertia is approximately constant .",
    "however , it is reduced ( the reduction is 16% and 4% in n = z=14 and 76 , respectively ) due to the rpa correlations , as seen in figure  [ fig : eom2a14 ] .",
    "the rpa correlations cause relatively smaller effect on the moment of inertia in the heavier system than in the lighter one .",
    "this is because of the absolute @xmath2-dependence of the @xmath118 becomes slightly smaller and the mean field moment of inertia becomes much larger in the heavier system .",
    "the spherical oscillator part in our hamiltonian , equation ( [ eq : qq1 ] ) , can in these cases be replaced by any set of spherical single - particle energies .",
    "this does not affect the general properties of the rpa correlations .",
    "the result would not qualitatively change when including a spin - orbit splitting .",
    "now the above systems are studied for the version ( ii ) , i.e. by dropping the @xmath119 matrix elements of the quadrupole operators @xmath14 , equations  ( [ eq : q1])-([eq : q3 ] ) .",
    "we recall that the quadrupole hamiltonian with @xmath6 is commonly used for obtaining the self - consistent solutions which includes both non - zero spin - orbit terms as well as the qq - forces  @xcite .",
    "this task needs much less efforts , since solutions can be found in a relatively small configuration space . having in mind that the @xmath0 particle - hole excitations are energetically unfavored relative to the @xmath6",
    ", one would expect a reliable results within the model .",
    "in addition , the effect of the higher lying @xmath0 vibrations could be studied .",
    "the self - consistent mean field solutions of the routhian in equation  ( [ eq : routh ] ) are again found from the relations  ( [ eq : qqsc1 ] ) where this time the quadrupole operators are written in the stretched representation  @xcite .    in this model",
    "the angular momentum is as above proportional to @xmath2 but the rpa correlation energy does not any more influence the moment of inertia as can be seen in figure  [ fig : eom2b ] .",
    "we conclude that an important part of the rpa correlations originate from the @xmath0 part of the qq - forces .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the simple qq - forces with @xmath6 provide quite reasonable results with regard equilibrium deformations in the mean field calculations .",

    "next , we apply the volume conservation constraint and the double - stretched representation of quadrupole operators and compare the results with those obtained with the ( normal ) qq - forces .",
    "we remind that the double - stretched representation is based on the condition such that the change in the density distribution must be accompanied with a change in the potential  @xcite .    for the triaxially deformed oscillator the self - consistency condition @xcite @xmath123 and the volume conservation constraint @xmath124 yield a self - consistent residual quadrupole interaction  @xcite @xmath125 where",

    "the self - consistent @xmath131 can be found as  @xcite @xmath132 from the self - consistency condition , equation  ( [ eq : dsqq5 ] ) , follows that @xmath133 the @xmath128 operators do therefore not affect the mean field energy and can be used directly in the rpa formalism .    in figure",

    "the qq - forces give a very flat minimum that is changing relatively fast with the rotational frequency .",
    "this causes a large correlation energy that also is changing relatively fast with the rotational frequency . as a consequence",
    ", there is the large contribution from the rpa correlations to the angular momentum seen in figure  [ fig : ho10 ] .",
    "a small contribution to the total angular momentum could be explained as the result of the increase of the rigidity of the potential with the increase of the rotational frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the flat potential energy surface is also the reason why we obtain a delayed start of the rotational band using the qq - forces . with the volume conservation constraint one",
    "observes an opposite behavior .",
    "the minimum is much more distinct and is less affected by the rotation . in figure",
    "[ fig : ho10 ] a small increase in the dynamical moment of inertia can be seen which is consistent with the fact that the potential gets flatter with increasing @xmath2 when using the volume conservation constraint .    in figure",
    "[ fig : moia ] the mass dependence of the rpa contribution to the moment of inertia , as calculated with the volume conservation constraint and the double - stretched quadrupole residual interaction , is plotted . even though the rpa contribution to @xmath135 is increasing with increasing a mass number",
    "a the relative contribution is decreasing .",
    "this is consistent with the simple picture that the mean field approximation works better in heavier systems .",
    "the value of the angular momentum and the moment of inertia are generally dependent on the correlations induced by the shape vibrations .",
    "the size of the rpa correlations depends on the curvature of the mean field potential .",
    "their influence on the angular momentum and on the moment of inertia is determined on how the potential curvature depends on the rotational frequency .",
    "this dependence is different in different mass regions and is determined by the degree of filling of the shell .",
    "the scale of the variation of the correlations is sensitive to the accuracy of the mean field approximation and to the size of the configuration space .",
    "the very flat potential of the qq - forces leads to large effects of the quadrupole correlations upon the angular momentum and the moment of inertia .",
    "in fact , the large rpa contributions for the qq - forces cause the delay of the rotation in contrast to the results obtained with the volume conservation constraint . in addition , the qq - forces , without the volume conservation condition , may not produce any stable minimum above a certain deformation and it seems that the deformation in the considered cases is close to that limit . when comparing the results with and without the @xmath136 mixing one notices that even when the two calculations provide similar mean field solutions , which is expected  @xcite , the rpa does yield significant differences .",
    "we conclude that these forces are not very realistic in describing rpa correlations in nuclear structure .",
    "the rpa calculations with the volume conservation constraint and the double - stretched quadrupole residual interaction give a smaller contribution to the angular momentum .",
    "the rpa contributions to the moment of inertia is almost constant as a function of the rotational frequency but show a strong dependence on the mass number .",
    "even though the absolute contribution is increasing with increasing the mass number , the relative contribution is decreasing from 11% at a=20 to less then 2% at a=80 .",
    "the rpa based on the double - stretched quadrupole residual interaction provides a more realistic result in contrast to the cases of the qq - forces discussed above .",
    "finally , we conclude that the volume conservation constraint is very important requirement when considering effective forces .",
    "further analysis of the self - consistency between a mean field approximation and a treatment of the quadrupole shape vibrations for various realistic forces is needed to make reliable comparisons with experimental results .",
    "another important question which has to be addressed in further investigations is how other multipoles such as monopole and octupole ones would affect the present results .",
