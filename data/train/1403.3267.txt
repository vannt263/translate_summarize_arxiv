    "the fundamental understanding of elementary chemical reactions is an important subject in chemical physics .",
    "the development of molecular - beam scattering techniques has made it possible to experimentally study detailed state - to - state dynamics of gas phase reactions@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the interest for developing reactive - scattering theories to describe chemical reactions arose much earlier , shortly after the discovery of quantum mechanics@xcite , when it was realized that the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation leads naturally to the concept of potential - energy surfaces ( pes ) , that govern the motion of atoms during a chemical reaction .",
    "the pes play such a crucial role as the potential governing the dynamics of the nuclei , that almost all reactive - scattering approaches , either classical@xcite or quantum@xcite , are using pes data as initial input . for many cases ,",
    "the ground - state bo pes is sufficient for the description of scattering events@xcite , since the motion of the nuclei is typically much slower than that of the electrons so that electrons can be assumed to be effectively in the ground state . in this respect , the notion of electronic nonadiabaticity is identified with the set of all those ingredients that are missed when assuming that the motion of atoms is governed by the lowest ( ground - state ) pes .",
    "it is not uncommon to find situations where nonadiabaticity plays an important role@xcite .",
    "such examples encompass reactions involving light ions , charge transfer and photochemical processes@xcite . to capture this type of nonadiabaticity ,",
    "reactive - scattering treatments involving excited pess were developed@xcite , which allow to take into account the electronic excitations during scattering .",
    "in general , these approaches use as _ a priori _ inputs , besides several ground- and excited - states pess , the nonadiabatic coupling terms@xcite between different surfaces .",
    "such coupling terms can nowadays be directly calculated through e.g.  the linear - response formalism of time - dependent density - functional theory@xcite .",
    "however , the multi - pes scattering approach typically only involves a small number of surfaces ( in most cases only the ground and first - excited pes are considered ) and may not always contain all essential ingredients of electronic nonadiabaticity .    in the work presented here , instead of directly utilizing several electronic surfaces and non - adiabatic couplings as input ,",
    "we choose a specific coordinate system convenient for scattering calculations which allows us to quantify electronic nonadiabaticity from a perspective that differs from the normal treatment in the literature . as an illustration of our idea , and in order to make it as clear as possible , we restrict ourselves to a simple 1d collinear model , which was originally designed to study the nonadiabatic effects in a proton - transfer reaction@xcite by shin and metiu .",
    "we emphasize , that our approach also remains valid for ab initio hamiltonians in full dimensionality .",
    "as many other recent studies on electronic nonadiabaticity in the literature@xcite , we solely restrict our discussion to a 1d model in order to simplify the mathematical expressions and to highlight the essence of the underlying physics .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce the model used for the illustration of our scattering treatments on electronic nonadiabaticity .",
    "these treatments are discussed in detail in section [ sec : scattering ] , where we consider two approaches which can be compared in parallel . in the first approach , which we term implicit electron approach ( cf . to section [ subsec : ie ] )",
    ", we consider the electron implicitly , i.e. we assume that the three ions move on the ground state bo pes . in the second approach , which we call explicit electron approach ( cf . to section [ subsec : ee ] ) ,",
    "we describe the motion of all particles ( three ions and one electron ) simultaneously , so that the electron will be taken into account explicitly . in both sections introducing the two apporaches",
    "we tutorially derive the methods and then we summarize the algorithm . in both ie and ee approaches state - selective transition probabilities",
    "are calculated , and the results and further analyses are shown in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , the conclusions are given in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "before demonstrating our two approaches , which will be disscussed in the next section , we first present the model which we use for the illustration of our implicit and explicit electron schemes .",
    "in order to keep a clear focus on our approaches to describe electronic nonadiabaticity , we restrict ourselves here to a simple but physically motivated collinear reactive scattering model .",
    "we emphasize that it is straightforward to apply our implicit and explicit electron approaches also to ab initio hamiltonians in full dimensionality .",
    "our model is quite similar to the original shin - metiu model , containing three ions and one electron confined to a one - dimensional collinear motion . in order to investigate reactive scattering with such a model ,",
    "we need to include the scattering states describing asymptotic channels in which one ion is far away from the other part of the system . in other words , we need to remove the constraint of fixed terminal ions , to allow all ions to move along the 1d line .",
    "this generalization of the original shin - metiu model is sketched in figure [ fig.model ] .",
    "allowing all ions to move enables us to describe the transition from the in - channel configuration to the out - channel configuration through a collinear collision .",
    "this process involves transfers of both an ion and an electron .    schematic representation of our generalization of the shin - metiu model .",
    "in contrast to the original shin - metiu model , we allow all ions to move in the present study .",
    "two asymptotic channels ( in and out ) are considered .",
    "the in - channel describes a bound system of ions a , b , and the electron .",
    "ion c is initially located far from this bound system .",
    "the out - channel describes a bound system of ions b , c , and the electron . here",
    ", ion c is located far from the bound complex .",
    "transitions from the in - channel to the out - channel involve a simultaneous electron - ion rearrangement.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the hamiltonian of our extended shin - metiu model can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the kinetic energy of the three ions @xmath2 and the kinetic energy of the electron is @xmath3 ( atomic units are used throughout ) . since we allow the ions a and c to move , the masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 are in general finite ( the infinite mass limit corresponds to the original model of fixed ions ) . here",
    "we focus on a case where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are large compared to the mass @xmath6 in the center .",
    "this allows us to model a light - atom transfer process .",
    "we emphasize that the positions of a and c could also be viewed as center - of - mass cordinates of small clusters or nano - particles motivating further a small mass ratio @xmath7 .",
    "the most important parameter for electronic nonadiabaticity in the present model is therefore the mass ratio between the middle ion and the electron .",
    "the masses of the ions at the terminal positions do not play an essential role in our discussion as long as they are much larger than the mass @xmath6 of the ion in the center .    in atomic units ,",
    "we take @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 . for the center ion we consider two cases ( i ) @xmath11 and ( ii ) @xmath12 , i.e. the mass of the ion b",
    "is taken to be the proton mass or 3 times the proton mass .",
    "it is expected that the electronic nonadiabaticity differs in the two cases .",
    "the interaction between the ions is given by @xmath13 , where we choose short range interactions with the following form @xmath14 here , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are parameters that tune the strength and the range of the interaction .",
    "we employ similar expressions for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "with @xmath19 we denote the electron - ion interaction which we also choose to be short ranged and given by the following form @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we denote the ionic and electronic coordinates respectively .",
    "again , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are parameters characterizing the strength and the range of the potential .",
    "similar expressions are employed for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "such a choice of interaction potentials qualitatively captures a realistic situation in which ions are repulsive to each other and are attractive to the electron .",
    "the short range potentials chosen here are for the convenience of the scattering calculations .",
    "one feature of the chosen potentials that should be highlighted is that the ion - ion repulsion is singular at zero separation .",
    "this imposes the constraint that the ions can not bypass each other , or in other words , the ions preserve the order during the scattering process . hence",
    ", we only need to consider two asymptotic channels ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the electron - ion attraction is soft at zero separation , which allows the electron to pass the ions . in order to illustrate our approach , we choose in the present work for the range parameters @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the interaction strengths are given by @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the parameters are chosen to produce a physical potential - energy surface for rearrangement scattering .",
    "note , that it is predominantely the masses and not the interaction parameters that determine the magnitude of electronic nonadiabaticity .",
    "we emphasize that in general the choice of interaction potentials is not imposing any restrictions on our approach . the selected potentials and parameters are physically motivated ,",
    "keep the present discussion simple , and allow us to focus on the central topic of this work , the description of nonadiabatic electronic motion in electron - ion rearrangement collisions .",
    "in this section , we introduce two quantum reactive scattering approaches to calculate the transition probabilities of the rearrangement collision .",
    "the electronic nonadiabaticity will be visualized through the comparison of the two approaches . in the first approach ,",
    "the information of the electron is only contained in the ground - state bo pes .",
    "we therefore call it _ implicit electron ( ie ) approach_. in the second approach , the electron and the three ions are considered all at the same level , i.e. we solve a four - body quantum reactive scattering problem . in the following we refer to this as _ explicit electron ( ee ) approach_. in the two approaches ,",
    "we calculate the transition ( reaction ) probability and thus obtain the reaction rate by taking an average over boltzmann factors .",
    "the differences in the two approaches indicate the electronic nonadiabaticity .    the model described in the last section",
    "is used to demonstrate the two approaches . in the following discussion , we only focus on the figures for the case @xmath33 for illustrations .",
    "the plots are qualitatively very similar for the case of @xmath34 .        in the ie approach on the collinear model , the three ions are moving on the ground - state pes determined by the electronic hamiltonian , so three degrees of freedom are needed to describe the system . since there is no external field , the system is translationally invariant .",
    "hence , if we choose jacobi coordinates , and separate off the degree of freedom describing the center - of - mass motion , then only two internal degrees of freedom are left , which can be chosen as @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the in - channel configuration or as @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the out - channel configuration .",
    "each set of coordinates has its merits in describing a particular configuration of the system .",
    "however , in order to describe the whole scattering process using one set of coordinates , we employ in the following a mass - weighted hyperspherical coordinate system@xcite . to this end",
    ", we first define mass - weighted coordinates as    @xmath39    in which the @xmath40 s denote different reduced masses .",
    "for example , @xmath41 is the reduced mass of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the reduced mass of @xmath45 and the center - of - mass of @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is an arbitrary mass , we choose it to be equal to @xmath48 in this paper .",
    "the two new sets of coordinates have the noteworthy property @xmath49 which allows us to introduce a polar coordinate system by defining    @xmath50    in terms of these new coordinates , the in - channel and out - channel configurations can be described on equal footing .",
    "it can be shown that the angle @xmath51 $ ] is bounded , with @xmath52      the hamiltonian in the above introduced mass - weighted hyperspherical coordinate system can be written as @xmath53+v(\\rho,\\theta),\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the ground - state bo surface shown in figure [ fig.contour ] for the case @xmath55 .",
    "for every given nuclear configuration , we solve for the ground - state bo surface by exact diagonalization of the electronic hamiltonian in a finite - difference representation in hyperspherical coordinates .     for the model ( @xmath33 ) in the mass - weighted hyperspherical coordinate system , with",
    "the corresponding cartesian coordinates @xmath56 .",
    "note the two very different scales of the axes .",
    "the green cross indicates the position of the classical transition state .",
    "it is the energy minimum along the red dashed line , and the maximum along the black solid cut for a constant @xmath57 .",
    "the shape of @xmath54 along the black solid cut is schematically sketched in the inset in the top - left corner .",
    "the two valleys in the plot can be identified to either describe in - channel or out - channel configurations.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in figure [ fig.contour ] , it can be seen that for a given radius @xmath57 , the cut along @xmath58 has a double - well shape , and the minimum corresponds to either the in - channel or the out - channel configuration . from the scale of the coordinate axes it is obvious that the radius @xmath57 is a slow variable compared to the angle @xmath58 , which implies that the two variables are approximately decoupled .",
    "we therefore perform the hyperspherical expansion for the eigenstates of the hamiltonian by regarding the radius as a parameter@xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a set of complete orthonormal functions of @xmath58 for a given @xmath57 .",

    "the curves are plotted in two different colors depending on whether they are in - channel states or out - channel states , according to where the wave function is localized .",
    "the relative position between the two sets of curves is very sensitive to the input parameters ( masses and interaction strength ) , and in our case we choose the interaction parameters to be asymmetric to avoid degeneracies in these curves .",
    "this allows to unambiguously identify the nondegenerate asymptotic states as vibrational states of in- or out - channel configurations . for our setup",
    ", it can be seen that these eigenvalues appear in pairs .",
    "the wave functions in a given pair also specify the internal vibrational states of the initial and final scattering wave functions .",
    "the scattering from a given in - channel configuration to a given out - channel configuration can be related to a transtion within a pair . since the two wave functions in a pair span a 2-dimensional space that is approximately decoupled from the space spanned by the wave functions belonging to other pairs ( inter - pair distances are large ) , by considering each pair separately , we can have a state - to - state description of the reaction , which is the advantage of reactive - scattering theory . to make the illustration as simple as possible ,",
    "in the following we only take the lowest pair , within which the transition gives the main contribution to the transition probability since this pair is energetically more favourable .     for the case @xmath55 ( black solid line ) along the cut across the saddle point on the pes .",

    "to visualize the electronic nonadiabaticity in the reactive scattering context , we compare the different probabilities obtained from the ie and ee approaches described above , for the two cases @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which are shown in figure [ fig.probability ] .",
    "the horizontal axis is the total energy of the system , which can be tuned by changing the incident kinetic energy of ion c. since we treat the ie and ee approaches completely in parallel , the main difference between the schemes arises from whether the electron is treated explicitly or not .",
    "there are small deviations from the exact case due to the truncation in the hyperspherical expansion and the two - state approximation .",
    "however , these approximations become exact as the mass ratio between the ions in the middle and at the ends approaches zero . for the mass ratios @xmath7 considered here , which are at the order of @xmath164 , the approximations are very accurate . thus the deviation in the transition probability between the two approaches can almost exclusively be attributed to the difference between ie and ee , which is the main contribution of the electronic nonadiabaticity .",

    "only when the ion c has enough kinetic energy , the collision leads to a reactive rearrangement .    in low energy scattering regime , which is of chemical interests",
    ", it is shown that as the energy increases , the difference between the results from the two approaches becomes larger and larger .",
    "this directly shows the electronic nonadiabaticity is pronounced when the kinetic energy of the ions is relatively large . by comparing the results for @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    ", we see that the electronic nonadiabaticity is more pronounced when the mass of the central ion , or the mass ratio between the central ion and the electron , is smaller .",
    "this directly reflects the fact that the nonadiabaticity comes from the coupled motion of the electron and central ion during the rearrangement .",
    "the larger the mass ratio is , the better the traditional bo description , or similarly , the ie approach will be , as expected .",
    "we also notice that the probability obtained in the ie approach increases faster from zero than the one in the ee approach .",
    "this implies that the rate of the rearrangement is slower in the ee approach . to see this",
    ", we calculate the ratio of the reaction rates from the two approaches for a certain range of temperatures , which is shown in figure [ fig.rate_ratio ] .",
    "we have taken the standard expression@xcite that assumes the rate is the canonical average of many collisions where the kinetic energy of the incident particle c is taken from a canonical distribution at temperature @xmath168 : @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the vibrational partition function of the in - channel configuration and @xmath171 denotes the ground - state energy of the in - channel wavefunction . here",
    "we approximate the contribution from transitions between all pairs by only the lowest pair .",
    "this is valid because from figure [ fig.a_eigenvalue ] , the gap between the lowest pair and the pair from the 1st excited states in the asymptotic region is approximately 0.3 hartree , which means in thermodynamic equilibrium , the population ratio between the the second lowest pair and the lowest pair according is about @xmath172 , which is negligible .",
    "the ratio @xmath173 of the reaction rates for @xmath33 and @xmath34 from the ee and ie approaches as a function of temperature @xmath168.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    an alternative assumption is that the kinetic energy of the incident particle c is sharply peaked at a particular value of energy .",
    "the ratio of the reaction rates corresponds to the ratio of the two @xmath174 curves .",
    "this ratio is shown in the insets of both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig.probability ] for values of @xmath175 where @xmath174 is non negligible .",
    "the behaviour of the ratio of the reaction rates can be understood thinking that the ee approach goes beyond the usual ground - state bo approximation and effectively considers the electronic excited states .",
    "since the first excited - state surface often has a positive curvature near the maximum of the ground - state surface , as in this model@xcite , this implies that the excited state is energetically repulsive along the direction leading to the rearrangement .",
    "this means that any wavepacket with population restricted to the first excited state will always be bounced back , leading to nonreactive scattering .",
    "the result in the ie approach , or ground - state bo approximation , overestimates the rate which coincides with the results in the original paper of the shin - metiu model , which relies on a quite different approach@xcite .",
    "further , from comparing the results for the two cases with different @xmath6 , again we see that the difference in the rate becomes larger when the central ion is lighter .    in both the ie and ee approaches ,",
    "the potentials @xmath176 , and @xmath177 are used as input for the dwba calculation , which are crucial in determining the transition probability .",
    "hence , in order explore the region at which the electronic nonadiabaticity is important , we compare the potentials obtained from the two approaches in figure [ fig.v_compare ] for the two cases with different @xmath6 .     the potentials @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 as a function of radius @xmath57 obtained from the approaches of ie ( blue solid ) and ee ( red dashed ) .",

    "the upper panel displays the case for @xmath33 , and the lower one for @xmath34.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    from these figures , we notice that at large @xmath57 , which is the situation when one ion is far apart from the other two ions and the electron , the curves from the two approaches are on top of each other .",
    "whereas in the region of smaller @xmath57 , the three ions get together relatively closely , or in other words near the classical transition state , there are differences between the two . for the @xmath33 case ,",
    "the difference is more pronounced .",
    "this shows the electronic nonadiabaticity is most important near the barrier region or the transition state of a chemical reaction , while it hardly contributes to the property of the system in the equilibrium geometry , i.e.  in the two asymptotic channels .",
    "it also shows the nonadiabaticity depends on the mass ratio of the central ion and the electron significantly .",
    "hence , this confirms that our ee approach allows to capture electronic nonadiabaticity and the resulting renormalization of reaction barriers .",
    "in this work we proposed a scheme to capture electronic nonadiabaticity from a reactive scattering perspective . for reactive rearrangement collisions",
    ", we introduced two approaches , one which treats the electron implicitly , and a nonadiabatic approach where the electron is treated explicitly and on a similar footing as the involved ions .",
    "both approaches rely on a mass - weighted hyperspherical coordinate system which allows for an efficient and unified representation of in- and out - channels .",
    "in particular , for the explicit electron approach the transformation to the hyperspherical coordinate system introduces a mixing of the original cartesian coordinates of the ions and the electron , which allows to introduce approximations with smaller error compared to the original cartesian coordinate system .",
    "both approaches differ only in the way the electron is treated .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the differences in reaction rates obtained from both methods directly reflect the electronic nonadiabaticity .    to exemplify our approach , the original shin - metiu model was generalized by removing the constraint of fixed terminal ions . within this model ,",
    "we have investigated two cases , in which the mass of the central ion were set to the proton mass and three times the proton mass , while all the other system parameters were kept identical .",
    "it was shown that the electronic nonadiabaticity is larger when the mass ratio between the central ion and the electron becomes smaller . in the frame of the hyperspherical coordinate system",
    ", we found that nonadiabatic effects are much more pronounced at a small radius @xmath57 .",
    "physically this corresponds to regions near the reaction barrier or transition state .",
    "in contrast , nonadiabatic effects play no essential role near the equilibrium configuration in the asymptotic channels .",
    "this illustrates that our proposed approaches provide an accurate description for low - energy scattering events , which is the typical case for chemical applications . in our investigation",
    ", we showed that the electronic nonadibaticity leads to a larger deviation in transition probabilities as the energy of the system is increasing .",
    "we also showed that the implicit electron approach overestimates the reaction rate at room temperature , since the transition probability increases faster from zero compared to the transition probabilities from the explicit electron approach .",
    "this observation is in accord with the results in earlier work@xcite .",
    "the case of extremely high kinetic impact energies , which is of less interest for common chemical reactions , has not been discussed in the present work .",
    "however , we note that the nonadiabaticity in this case can be expected to play a minor role , since the scattering is fully kinetic .",
    "collisions in this limit are fully elastic and thus do not depend at all on the intrinsic electronic structure .",
    "the present study differs from other studies on nonadiabaticity in that the electronic nonadiabaticity was studied from a reactive - scattering perspective , and the way we treat the ions and the electron at the same footing is conceptually different from other nonadiabatic treatments based on multi - pess .",
    "since the quantum reactive - scattering approach describes reactions at a state - to - state resolution ( in this paper we consider @xmath180 ) , our approach allows to gain some insights and understanding of electronic nonadiabatic effects at a more microscopic state - to - state level .    our way of studying the electronic nonadiabaticity",
    "can be utilized to investigate real chemical systems involving a light ion which transfers in concert with one electron in a collinear arrangement , since the approach does not depend on the mathematical form of the interactions .",
    "future prospects include the generalization to multi - electron transfers which appear in negative-@xmath181 systems , where electron transfers occur pairwise , or an extension of the present work to more sophisticated proton - coupled electron transfer reactions as studied in refs . @xcite .",
    "also an embedding of the present scheme into density - functional approaches is desirable . here",
    "further studies are required to analyze how such effective ( multi - component ) density - functional potentials have to be constructed .",
    "all these aspects will be in the focus of future studies .",
