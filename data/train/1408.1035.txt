    "in autonomous systems exhibiting a stable periodic behavior ( in other words , limit cycle oscillators ) , deviations along the trajectory asymptotically in time neither decay nor grow , i.e. they are neutral .",
    "this neutrality is due to the time homogeneity , and may disappear as soon as this homogeneity is broken by means of a time - dependent external forcing . the phenomenon of synchronization of oscillators by periodic signal is well known and quite understood , here the oscillations follow the forcing ( e.g. , they attain the same frequency ) .",
    "when the role of this time - dependent forcing is played by a stochastic noise , the situation becomes less evident .",
    "the first effect of noise on periodic oscillations is the phase diffusion : the oscillations are no more periodic but posses finite correlations  @xcite . however",
    ", a nonlinear system may somehow follow the noisy force .",
    "although it is not so evident how the synchronization between the system response and noise can be detected for one system , this synchronization can be easily detected by looking on whether the responses of a few identical systems driven by the common noise signal are identical or not . with such an approach , synchrony ( asynchrony ) of driven systems",
    "was early treated in the works  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical criterion for synchronization is the negative leading lyapunov exponent ( le ; it measures the average exponential growth rate of infinitesimally small deviations from the trajectory ) in the driven system .    in different fields",
    "the effect of synchronization of oscillators by common noise is known under different names . in neurophysiology",
    "the property of a single neuron to provide identical outputs for repeated noisy input is treated as `` reliability ''  @xcite . in the experiments with noise - driven nd : yag lasers  @xcite this synchronization was called `` consistency '' . when driving signal is related to not stochastic but deterministic chaos , one considers generalized synchronization  @xcite . in the last case the driven system is often chosen to be chaotic .",
    "in fact , in the above mentioned examples there is no limit cycle oscillators at the noiseless limit : for experiments described in  @xcite the noiseless system is stable , i.e. le is negative , and for generalized synchronization in chaotic systems , le is positive .",
    "evidently , in this cases , le preserves its sign at sufficiently weak noise .",
    "a more intriguing situation takes place when le in noiseless system is zero ( limit cycle oscillators ) .",
    "analytical and numerical treatments for different types of noise show weak noise to play an ordering role : le shifts to negative values , and oscillators become synchronized  @xcite . in the work",
    "@xcite the nonideal situations are considered : slightly nonidentical oscillators driven by an identical noise signal , and identical oscillators driven by slightly nonidentical noise signals ; and additionally , positive le was reported for large noise in some smooth systems similarly to how it was in the works  @xcite .",
    "note that in  @xcite le was calculated for oscillators driven by a random sequence of pulses , in  @xcite the white gaussian noise was considered .",
    "a noise of other nature is the telegraph one . by a normalized telegraph noise we mean the signal having values @xmath0 and switching instantaneously between these values time to time .",
    "the distribution of time intervals between consequent switchings is exponential with the average value @xmath1 .",
    "the case of telegraph noise may be interesting not only because it completely differs from the previous two , but also because it allows to `` touch '' the question of relations between periodic and stochastic driving , e.g. to compare results for telegraph noise with the average switching time @xmath1 and the stepwise periodic signal of the same amplitude and the period @xmath2 .",
    "this is why we consider synchronization by telegraph noise .",
    "a limit cycle oscillator with a small external force is known to be able to be well described within the phase approximation  @xcite , where only dynamics of the system on the limit cycle of the noiseless system is considered .",
    "the system states on this limit cycle can be parameterized by a single parameter , phase @xmath3 . with a stochastic force",
    "the equation for the phase reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the period of the limit cycle in the noiseless system , @xmath6 is the amplitude of noise , @xmath7 is the normalized sensitivity of the system to noise [  @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a normalized telegraph noise .      studying statistical properties of the system under consideration , one can introduce two probability density functions @xmath10 defining the probability to locate the system in vicinity of @xmath3 with @xmath11 , correspondingly , at the moment @xmath12 .",
    "then the master equations of the system read @xmath13&= & \\frac{1}{\\tau}w_-({\\varphi},\\,t)-\\frac{1}{\\tau}w_+({\\varphi},\\,t),\\label{e2}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial w_-({\\varphi},\\,t)}{\\partial t }   + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{\\varphi}}\\left[(\\omega-{\\varepsilon}f({\\varphi}))w_-({\\varphi},\\,t)\\right]&= & \\frac{1}{\\tau}w_+({\\varphi},\\,t)-\\frac{1}{\\tau}w_-({\\varphi},\\,t).\\label{e3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the terms of @xmath14 and @xmath15 the last system takes the form of @xmath16    for steady distributions the probability flux @xmath17 is constant : @xmath18 and system  ( [ e4 ] ) with periodic boundary conditions has the solution @xmath19 where @xmath20 is defined by the normalization condition : @xmath21 the probability flux reads @xmath22      studying stability of solutions of the stochastic equation  ( [ e1 ] ) , one has to consider behavior of a small perturbation @xmath23 : @xmath24 the lyapunov exponent ( le ) measuring the average exponential growth rate of @xmath23 can be obtained by averaging the corresponding velocity @xmath25    let us remind that le determines the asymptotic behavior of small perturbations , and describes whether close states diverge or converge with time .",
    "this process is not necessarily monotonous , i.e. , close trajectories can diverge at some time intervals while demonstrating asymptotic convergence , and vice versa .    when @xmath26 or @xmath27 , the eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) can be simplified : @xmath28 the last expression is strictly negative .",
    "indeed , in the fourier space it reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "we found that either for weak noise or frequent switching le is negative regardless to the properties of the smooth function @xmath7 ( as for weak white gaussian noise in similar systems  @xcite ) . in the works",
    "@xcite , moderate white gaussian noise was shown to be able to lead to instability even in smooth systems . in the light of above facts , it is interesting ( i ) _ what is the region of validity of our analytical theory _ , ( ii ) _ whether there is some footprints of the synchronization by periodic forcing in the stochastic synchronization _ , and ( iii ) _ whether telegraph noise can desynchronize oscillators_.    for the two first purpose we performed simulation of a modified van der pol oscillator : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is either a telegraph noise with the average switching time @xmath1 or a periodic stepwise signal with the period @xmath2 , i.e. the constant switching time @xmath1 .",
    "the forcing - free modified van der pol oscillator has the round stable limit cycle of the unit radius for all @xmath33 .",
    "nevertheless , the phase equation  ( [ e1 ] ) with @xmath34 and the simple function @xmath35 may be correctly adopted only if the phase speed is near - constant all over the limit cycle , which is possible at small @xmath36 only .",
    "for the modified van der pol oscillator  ( [ e9 ] ) at @xmath37 .",
    "the solid lines present the analytical results of phase description , the triangles plot results of the approximation  ( [ e8 ] ) , the circles correspond to numerical simulation of the noisy modified van der pol oscillator , and the dashed line corresponds to numerical simulation of the periodically driven one.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=62.0% ]   for the modified van der pol oscillator  ( [ e9 ] ) at @xmath37 .",

    "[ fig1 ] one can see that our analytical theory is fortunately in good agreement with the results of analytical simulation not only for weak noise ; and the dependence @xmath38 for the stochastic driving has no footprints of the one for the periodic driving .",
    "while the dynamical system  ( [ e9 ] ) does not exhibit positive les at any noise intensity and any @xmath36 , they can be observed for a van der pol  duffing model : @xmath39 where `` duffing parameter '' @xmath40 describes nonisochronicity of oscillations . in fig .",

    "having considered the phenomenon of synchronization of limit cycle oscillators by common telegraph noise , we can summarize :            here we do not present results for the nonideal situations ( like in  @xcite ) : slightly nonidentical oscillators driven by an identical noise signal , and identical oscillators driven by slightly nonidentical noise signals .",
    "the reason is that for weak noise these results appear to be the same as in  @xcite but with @xmath41 given by eq .",
