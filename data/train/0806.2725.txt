    "thermal instability ( ti ) is an important physical process in astrophysical environments that are subject to radiative cooling .",
    "@xcite investigated the effect of ti caused by bremsstrahlung on structure formation at galactic and subgalactic scales .",
    "ti also plays an important role in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the ism consists of a diffuse high - temperature phase ( warm neutral medium , or wnm ) and a clumpy low - temperature phase ( cold neutral medium , or cnm ) , in supersonic turbulence .",
    "it is known that the ism is thermally unstable in the temperature range between these the two stable phases ; that is , in the range @xmath12 k @xcite .",
    "koyama & inutsuka ( 2000 , 2002 ) suggested that the structure of the ism is provided by the phase transition that is caused by ti that occurs in a shock - compressed region .",
    "the basic properties of ti were investigated by @xcite , who investigated the ti of a spatially uniform gas using linear analysis for the unperturbed state in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the net cooling function per unit volume and time was assumed to be @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite showed that gas is isobarically unstable for @xmath14 and is isochorically unstable for @xmath15 . in thermal non - equilibrium , however , where the heating and the cooling rates are not equal in the unperturbed state , the stability condition of ti is different from that in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this situation is , for example , generated in a shock - compressed region .",
    "@xcite derived a general criterion for the ti of gas in a non - equilibrium state .",
    "a flow dominated by cooling is isobarically unstable for @xmath16 and is also isochorically unstable for @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the phase with @xmath12k is both isobarically and isochorically unstable .",
    "the non - linear evolution of ti has been investigated by many authors @xcite using multi - dimensional simulations .",
    "however , the nonlinear behaviour has only been investigated analytically by a few authors , using some simplifications in an attempt to gain a deeper insight into the nature of ti .",
    "@xcite investigated analytic solutions under the isobaric approximation .",
    "however , this approximation is valid only in the limit of short or intermediate - scale .    in this paper , a new semi - analytic model for the non - linear hydrodynamical evolution of ti for a thermally non - equilibrium gas",
    "is considered without the isobaric approximation .",
    "once ti occurs , the density increases drastically until a thermally stable phase it reached . during this dynamical condensation",

    "s - s solutions describing dynamical condensation by ti are investigated by assuming a simple cooling rate without self - gravity .",
    "a family of s - s solutions which have two asymptotic limits ( the isobaric and the isochoric modes ) is presented .    in section [ formulation ] , we derive the s - s equations , and describe the mathematical characteristic of our s - s equations as well as the numerical methods . in section [ result ] , our s - s solutions are presented and their properties are discussed . in section",

    "using this formula and eqution ( [ ray ] ) , the raynolds number is given by @xmath239 because of @xmath240 , in the high - temperature case , the s - s solution with @xmath241 is expected to well describe the dynamical condensation .",
    "as the temperature decreases , @xmath242 decreases and becomes less than unity at a certain epoch .",
    "thereafter , our s - s solutions are invalid and the effect of dissipation becomes important .",
    "we have provided s - s solutions describing the dynamical condensation of a radiative gas with @xmath243 .",
    "the results of our investigation are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "given @xmath3 , a family of s - s solutions written as equation ( [ den p time ] ) is found .",
    "the s - s solutions have the following two limits .",
    "the gas condenses almost isobarically for @xmath244 , and the gas condenses almost isochorically for @xmath8 .",
    "the s - s solutions exist for all values of @xmath4 between the two limits ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "no s - s solutions are found in @xmath11 .",
    "the derived s - s solutions are compared with the results of numerical simulations for converging flows . in the case with any scale of perturbation in the post - shock region ,",
    "our s - s solutions approximate the results of numerical simulations well in the high density limit . in the post - shock region ,",
    "smaller - scale perturbations grow faster and asymptotically approach to the s - s solutions for @xmath244 .",
    "however , the difference of the growth rate between the isobaric mode ( @xmath151 ) and the isochoric mode ( @xmath150 ) is small .",
    "therefore , in actual astrophysical environments , the s - s condensations for various @xmath4 are expected to occur simultaneously .    in the s - s solutions presented in this paper ,",
    "a plane - parallel geometry is assumed .",
    "this situation is much simpler than the two - dimensional simulations that are currently being carried out involving ti , so the results are of limited use , although the results may be relevant to code tests that are run on a one - dimensional simulation .",
    "the stability analysis on the present s - s solution may provide some insight into the multi - dimensional turbulent velocity field .",
    "the effect of magnetic field and self - gravity may also be important in ism but they are neglected in this paper .",
