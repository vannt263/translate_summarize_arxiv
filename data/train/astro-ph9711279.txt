    "eight hours after the burst , we detected a new transient x  ray source , 1sax j0501.7 + 1146 , by re - pointing the ",

    "ray afterglow from grb970228 : ( a ) the backward extrapolation of the source light curve to the time of the burst is consistent with the average x  ray flux detected during the late phase of the burst @xcite ; ( b ) its celestial position is consistent with the burst position determined by the interplanetary network @xcite ; ( c ) a fading optical transient consistent with both the wide field camera ( wfc ) and nfis positions was also discovered @xcite ; ( d ) an observation of the grb error box with _ rosat _ provided the position of the x  ray transient source within a @xmath0 radius .",
    "its centroid coincides , within @xmath1 , with the optical transient position @xcite .",
    "the optical transient appears to be embedded in an apparently constant extended source @xcite .",
    "if it is a galaxy , those models that place grbs at cosmological distances would be favoured .    in another paper",
    "@xcite we reported the decay of the light curve of the source , which is described by a power law function ( @xmath2 with index @xmath3 ) that is consistent with that expected in simple relativistically expanding fireball models @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on the spectral evolution of grb970228 and its afterglow .",
    "grb970228 was detected by the gamma ",
    "ray burst monitor ( grbm , 40700 kev ) @xcite and wfc no .",
    "1 ( 1.526.1  kev ) @xcite aboard   on february 28.123620 ut @xcite .",
    "its position was determined to be within an error radius of @xmath4 ( 3@xmath5 ) centered at @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "eight hours after the initial detection , the narrow field instruments on - board   were pointed at the burst location for a first target of opportunity ( too1 ) observation from february 28.4681 to february 28.8330  ut .",
    "a new x  ray source , 1sax j0501.7 + 1146 , was detected @xcite in the grb error box by both the low energy ( 0.110 kev , 8725  s exposure time ) and medium energy ( 210  kev ,",
    "13444  s ) concentrators spectrometers ( lecs and mecs ) . the same field",
    "was again observed about three days later for a second observation ( too2 ) from march 3.7345 to march 4.1174 ( 16270  s mecs and 9510  s lecs ) . during this observation ,",
    "the 210 kev source flux had decreased by about a factor 20 .",
    "the main arguments for the association of this source with the x  ray afterglow of grb970228 have been discussed in section  1 .",
    "the data available from grbm for spectral analysis include two 1  s ratemeters ( 40700  kev and @xmath8100  kev ) and 128  s count spectra ( 40700  kev , 225 channels ) .",
    "the energy resolution of the grbm unit 1 , co - aligned with the wfc no .",
    "1 , is 20% at 280 kev @xcite .",
    "wfcs ( energy resolution @xmath9 20% at 6  kev ) were operated in normal mode with 31 channels in 1.526  kev and 0.5  ms time resolution @xcite .",
    "the burst direction was offset by 14@xmath10 with respect to the wfc axis .",
    "the effective area of the grbm unit 1 , co - aligned with the wfc no .",
    "1 , is @xmath9  420  @xmath11 in the 40700  kev band and is @xmath9  500  @xmath11 at 300  kev .",
    "the corresponding effective area of wfc no .",
    "1 averaged in the 226  kev energy band is 118  @xmath11 .",
    "the background level in the wfc and grbm energy bands was variable during the burst @xcite .",
    "this variation was apparent up to 100  kev , while above 100  kev the background was stable . for the wfc spectra and light curves ,",
    "the background level was estimated using an equivalent section of the detector area not illuminated by the burst . in the case of grbm ,",
    "background during the burst was estimated by interpolation , using a quadratic function that fit the 150  s count rate data before the burst and the 100  s data after its end .",
    "the presence of a variable background prevented the derivation of useful upper limits to the afterglow emission after the burst . during too1 ,",
    "the x - ray source associated with the burst afterglow was offset by about 10 with respect to the telescope axes . since the image centroid , for mecs 1 and 2 , coincided with of a strong - back that supports the detector window and absorbs most photons up to about 6  kev , we used for the spectral analysis only mecs 3 and lecs .",
    "the lecs and mecs spectra for too1 were extracted from a @xmath12 radius region around the centroid of the image source . for too2 ,",
    "the source was on - axis and the spectra from lecs and mecs were extracted from a @xmath13 radius region .",
    "the mecs spectra were equalized and added together .",
    "the background spectrum was estimated from long observations ( 200  ks for mecs and 100  ks for lecs ) of blank sky fields , using an equivalent detector region of the source image with a similar offset .",
    "figure  [ fig : timeprofile ] shows the time profiles of grb970228 in different energy bands after the background subtraction . in the @xmath14ray energy band ( 40700  kev )",
    ", the burst is characterized by an initial 5  s strong pulse followed , after 30  s , by a set of three additional pulses of decreasing intensity . in the x  ray band ( 1.510  kev )",
    "the first pulse starts within one second of the @xmath14ray pulse , achieves the peak flux later and has a duration three times longer .",
    "the entire burst duration is @xmath15  s. the @xmath14ray ( 40700  kev ) fluence of the entire burst is @xmath16 , which is a factor @xmath17 higher than the corresponding value in the 210 kev band .",
    "( this ratio is based on the more accurate analysis of the wfc data performed for this paper and corrects the approximate value given previously by costa et  al .",
    "for comparison , the 40700  kev fluence integrated over the first pulse is @xmath18 , which is a factor of @xmath19 higher than the corresponding fluence in 210  kev .",
    "the @xmath14ray peak flux is @xmath20 , while the corresponding 210 kev flux is @xmath21 , with a ratio between @xmath14ray and x  ray peak fluxes of @xmath22 . in the batse energy band ( 50300  kev )",
    "the fluence of grb970228 is 6.1@xmath23 .",
    "we divided the grb time profile into seven temporal sections , and performed a separate spectral analysis on the average spectrum of each section .",
    "the duration of the sections were chosen on the basis of the statistical quality of the data .",
    "in particular , we obtained two spectra ( 5 and 9  s duration , respectively ) for the 1@xmath24 pulse ( a and b in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeprofile ] ) , four 3  s spectra for the @xmath25 pulse ( c , d , e and f ) , and only one spectrum for the @xmath26 and @xmath27 pulses together ( g in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeprofile ] ) .",
    "all wfc spectra are well fit with power laws ( @xmath28 ) , while black - body spectra do not fit the data .",
    "we assumed power laws ( @xmath29 ) to deconvolve spectral data in the grbm band . in fig .",
    "[ fig : power ] we show the logarithmic power per photon energy decade ( the @xmath30 spectrum ) for six of the time intervals defined above .",
    "the spectral evolution of the 1@xmath24 grb pulse and its diversity from the subsequent pulses is evident .",
    "the initial part of the 1@xmath24 pulse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : power]a ) is quite hard , with noticeable curvature of the @xmath31 spectrum . the peak energy , that is not detectable in the wfc / grbm energy range , is likely above 700  kev .",
    "the decay part of the 1@xmath24 pulse shows substantial evolution , with a clearly detectable broad curvature . by fitting the photon spectrum with a smoothly broken power law @xcite",
    ", we found a peak energy at e@xmath32  kev .",
    "this peak energy behaviour is typical of grb spectral evolution @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] we show the time evolution from the burst onset of the grbm and wfc power law spectral indices @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for the 1@xmath24 pulse , the temporal behaviour of @xmath33 is well described by a linear law ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , 3 dof ) with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and t in seconds .",
    "the power law photon indices @xmath33 and @xmath34 do not evolve in the same way as a consequence of the curvature of the 1@xmath24 pulse spectra .",
    "we also note the interesting spectral softening during the decaying part of the pulse .",
    "the spectral behaviour of the @xmath25 pulse is significantly different from that of the 1@xmath24 one .",
    "the spectral data can be fit with a single power law over the 1.5700  kev range . during the first 3  s of the @xmath25 pulse",
    "the spectrum is significantly harder than during the last part of the 1@xmath24 pulse .",
    "the photon index @xmath33 of the @xmath25 pulse vs.  time from pulse onset shows some evidence of evolution ( it can be fit with a linear law as above with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) , but it is also consistent with a constant value .",
    "instead @xmath34 is definitely constant during the @xmath25 pulse .",
    "the overall wfc / grbm photon index of the @xmath25 pulse is initially @xmath41 and then @xmath42 .",
    "interestingly , there is no strong evidence for spectral curvature as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : power ] , probably indicating that the peak energy @xmath43 passed through the wfc / grbm energy band during the first part of the burst and , as a consequence , later it is below @xmath44  kev .",
    "low counting statistics prevents us from deriving good quality spectra for the last section of the @xmath25 pulse ( section f ) and for the @xmath26 and @xmath27 pulses , separately . for section",
    "f ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : power ] ) , the x  ray data were fit by a power - law model with @xmath45 , while the @xmath14ray data provided only a 2@xmath5 upper limit of the @xmath33 spectral index of @xmath46 . the average photon spectrum of the sum of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 is well fit with a power - law model of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "it appears that the spectrum is again harder than that at the end of the @xmath25 pulse and more similar to the one at the beginning of the @xmath25 pulse . in any case , it is consistent with a single power - law .",
    "the @xmath30 spectrum of the sum of the @xmath26 plus @xmath27 pulses is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : power]g .    remarkably , we find that the power - law spectral model continues to hold also during the x  ray afterglow .",
    "the photon spectrum of 1sax j0501.7 + 1146 in the 0.110  kev energy band as measured during the too1 observation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "it was obtained from the source count spectra of lecs and mecs after deconvolution for the instrument responses .",
    "spectral fits were performed with the xspec 9.0 package .",
    "we fit various functions to the source count rate spectrum ( see table  [ table ] ) .",
    "the best fit model , with a @xmath49 ( 10 dof ) is a power - law of photon index @xmath50 and photoelectric absorption @xmath51  @xmath52 . a power - law model with @xmath53",
    "does not fit the data nor does an absorbed black - body model . the probability that the difference in the @xmath54 between these models and the absorbed power - law is due to chance is @xmath55 and @xmath56 , for the power - law with @xmath53 and for the absorbed black - body , respectively .",
    "our determination of @xmath57 is consistent with the total galactic photoelectric absorption ( @xmath58  @xmath59  @xmath52 ) expected along the line of sight to the grb error box .",
    "we can exclude a nearby source with zero equivalent @xmath57 ( near the solar system ) at about @xmath60 statistical significance . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , we also show the best fit model spectrum of the x  ray afterglow . during the too2 observation ,",
    "the x  ray source was too weak to derive a high - quality spectrum .",
    "the mecs detected a 210  kev flux of @xmath61 from the source , while the lecs did not detect any significant flux ( @xmath60 upper limit of @xmath62 ) .",
    "the hardness ratio hr@xmath63 between the count rate in the hard x  ray band ( 210  kev ) and that in the soft band ( 0.12  kev ) is @xmath64 for too1 and @xmath82.5 for too2 ( @xmath60 lower limit ) .",
    "however the hardness ratio hr@xmath65 between two hard x  ray bands ( 35  kev and 1.53  kev ) does not show statistically significant variations from the first to the second too observation .",
    "thus we can not infer a change in the spectral shape from too1 to too2 .",
    "the non - thermal spectrum of the burst radiation and of the x  ray afterglow is the most important result of this analysis .",
    "a power law model was found to fit the spectral data better than a black body model .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath33 ( @xmath66 ) achieved at the onset of the 1@xmath24 pulse as well as the corresponding @xmath34 during the first 5  s are consistent with the asymptotic spectral index below the peak energy e@xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , as expected in synchrotron emission models ( the synchrotron shock model ( ssm ) @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral index of the 1@xmath24 pulse rapidly evolves to @xmath69 at the end of the @xmath14ray pulse . in the ssm framework",
    "the final value of @xmath33 during the 1@xmath24 pulse corresponds to an index of the non - thermal electron energy distribution function @xmath70 . during the first 3  s of the @xmath25 pulse",
    "the spectrum is significantly harder than during the last part of the 1@xmath24 pulse .",
    "this indicates significant re - energization or relaxation of the particle energy distribution function within the @xmath71  s between the 1@xmath24 and the @xmath25 pulse .",
    "it appears that the last three grb pulses and the x  ray afterglow have a similar non - thermal spectrum and that this spectrum does not appear to change from the first to the second too .",
    "these results are not consistent with simple cooling models of excited compact objects .",
    "an analysis of _ ginga _ data suggested the existence of black - body spectral components in the ` precursor ' or ` delayed ' grb emission in the 110  kev band @xcite . in this burst",
    "we find no evidence for a black - body spectral component of temperature @xmath722  kev or for a prominent soft x  ray component .",
    "furthermore , there is no evidence of upturn in the soft x ",
    "ray intensity with respect to the higher energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "an evolving non - thermal spectrum for both the burst and afterglow emission is generally expected in relativistic expanding fireball models @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the physics and locations of the shocks associated with the fireballs heavily influence the photon emission mechanisms .",
    "simple fireball models , in which only the forward blast wave radiates efficiently , predict an evolution of the peak energy as a function of the time @xmath73 from the burst onset , @xmath74 @xcite . by extrapolating our data for the 1@xmath24 pulse of grb970228 we obtain an initial @xmath75  mev . in this model , the overall evolution of the x ",
    "ray intensity is expected to evolve as @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 an appropriate photon index @xcite .",
    "if we use our best value of @xmath33 for the decay part of the @xmath25 pulse ( @xmath79 ) , we obtain @xmath80 , a value that is consistent with the observed decay of the grb970228 afterglow @xcite .",
    "however , if we use the value of @xmath33 determined at the end of the 1@xmath24 pulse ( @xmath81 ) , the resulting value of @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) would not agree with our observations .",
    "the discontinuity in the @xmath14ray spectral index observed from the end of the 1@xmath24 pulse to the beginning of the @xmath25 pulse requires an interpretation .",
    "given the continuity of the spectral index , starting from the @xmath25 pulse , any physical relation between the x  ray component of the grb and the afterglow emission most likely holds with the last set of hard grb pulses , not with the 1@xmath24 one .",
