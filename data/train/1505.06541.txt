    "nonlinear interactions between strong electromagnetic waves and plasmas have been studied in the context of laser plasma physics and astrophysical phenomena .",

    "there are also studies of parametric processes in the semi - classical formulation , which is used in this paper ( c.f",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    ", we focus on induced compton scattering ( ics ) , which is a parametric instability between photons and each electron , rather than plasmon . the condition for ics to be dominant process is when both the central frequency and the spectral width of strong electromagnetic radiations are greater than the langmuir plasma frequency .",
    "ics cools photons toward the bose - einstein condensation , while plasmas are heated by this process ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "ics has been studied in the context of laser plasma interaction both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "most of them studied the process with the two - fluid approximation , which accounts only for the linear regime of the instability . on the other hand ,",
    "ics has also been studied for the scattering process around high intensity astrophysical sources with the semi - classical formulation , which can partly treat the nonlinear regime ( e.g. refs . ) .",
    "however , they constrained plasma conditions around some astrophysical objects considering only the scattering optical depth to ics .",
    "it is known that there is a difficulty to treat the nonlinear regime of ics even with the semi - classical formulation as described in this paper .    in the semi - classical formulation ,",
    "a relaxation process of isotropic photons interacting with a rarefied maxwellian plasma by compton scattering is described by the kompaneets equation @xcite .",
    "the kompaneets equation is the fokker - plank equation describing evolution of a photon spectrum including the ics term , which comes from the boson nature of photons and , which is quadratic in the intensity of the radiation .",
    "therefore , for high intensity radiations , this quadratic term plays a dominant role and the kompaneets equation is reduced to the nonlinear convection equation ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : inducedonly ] ) ) .",
    "it is known that the nonlinear convection equation has the implicit solution , which will be multi - valued after a finite time starting from certain initial conditions .",
    "such a spectrum is unphysical and should be bent to be single - valued , i.e. , there should be an appropriate physical process which we have ignored ( e.g. ref . ) .",
    "different approaches have been adopted to resolve the unphysical behavior of a photon spectrum when ics dominates .",
    "peyraud ( 1968 ) @xcite considered heuristically to add a dispersive term ( the third derivative term ) to the nonlinear convection equation and made the equation korteweg - de vries - type , i.e. , soliton formation in frequency - space .",
    "reinish ( 1976 ) @xcite considered to recover the diffusive term ( the second derivative term ) , which is originally included in the kompaneets equation , and made the equation burgers - type , which allows formation of a shock wave structure like hydrodynamics . however , because the original diffusive term is linear in the intensity of radiations , this will not be applicable when the intensity of radiations becomes higher and higher .",
    "on the other hand , zeldovich and colleagues adopted the integral form of the equation , i.e. , the boltzmann equation ( eq . ( [ eq : boltzmannequation ] ) ) .",
    "they predicted formation of solitary structures in a radiation spectrum .",
    "it is worth distinguishing which spectral behaviors appear in a given condition between photons and electrons .",
    "there are also numerical studies of this problem by montes ( 1977 , 1979 ) @xcite and coppi et al .",
