    "obviously , the region with two solutions in each figure [ fig5 ] to [ fig9 ] , corresponds to case ( @xmath203 ) , i.e. one of those solution is stable , the one with higher value of @xmath100 , and the other unstable .",
    "the stable solutions computed in the previous subsection are not necessarily global minimum of the action . in this case",
    "they will not dominate the partition function and the zero - loop approximation can not be considered accurate @xcite .",
    "as the reduced action given in equation ( [ irnads ] ) grows without bound in the directions where @xmath76 or @xmath47 tend to infinity , the global minimum must be found either at the local minimum or at @xmath205 .",
    "the action tends to zero as @xmath76 and @xmath47 tend to zero , therefore the condition of global stability of the stable solutions is that the classical action @xmath42 must be negative .    if the classical action is positive , the partition function is dominated by points near the origin .",
    "but these points do not correspond to a black hole in thermal equilibrium . in this case ,",
    "the black hole , that corresponds to the stable solution of the reduced action , is metastable .",
    "we verified numerically which boundary conditions ( given by the values of @xmath41 , @xmath40 and @xmath206 ) correspond to globally stable black holes , i.e. to solutions that dominate the partition function .",
    "we can also see , using a simple argument , that for @xmath207 all locally stable solutions are also globally stable .",
    "indeed , york @xcite has shown that for the schwarzschild black hole the condition of global stability is @xmath207 and since the classical action @xmath42 is a decreasing function of @xmath40 and @xmath206 , this condition is still a bound for globally stability for all @xmath40 and @xmath206 .",
    "however for @xmath208 , there is always a certain region of @xmath209 , for which the locally stable solutions do not correspond to global minima of the action .",
    "we show these regions in figures [ fig5 ] to [ fig9 ] , where the regions for which the solutions do not correspond to a global minimum of the action , i.e. the metastable solutions , are shaded . in particular figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig9 ] do not present a shaded region because all the stable solutions are dominant in the limit @xmath118 as said above and for @xmath210 the region with metastable solutions is too thin to be presented in graphic .",
    "one can study the case where the boundary goes to infinity .",
    "there are two different ways for taking this limit : ( @xmath90 ) fixing the horizon radius @xmath76 and the charge @xmath47 of the black hole ; ( @xmath92 ) fixing the boundary conditions , i.e. fixing @xmath41 and @xmath40 . in this section",
    "we will study only the pure reissner - nordstrm - anti - de  sitter cases , i.e. the cases with @xmath212 .",
    "other cases , with either @xmath206 or @xmath40 equal to zero are considered in the next section .",
    "we will start by studying the first case : ( i ) fixing the black hole solution , i.e. fixing @xmath76 and @xmath47 and taking the limit @xmath211 , we obtain from equations ( [ betarnads ] ) and ( [ phirnads ] ) that the temperature @xmath213 and electrostatic potential @xmath40 go to zero as @xmath214 and @xmath215 , respectively . in this case",
    "the thermal energy goes to zero as @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the mass of the black hole given in ( [ 2 m ] ) . as also previously found in @xcite , the thermal energy at infinity",
    "is not equal to the adm mass of the black hole , due to the the fact that the spacetime is not asymptotically flat .",
    "note that in @xcite it is found that @xmath218 due to a different definition of the temperature of the ensemble .",
    "to determine the stability of the black hole solutions in this limit , we compute the heat capacity , from equation ( [ est2rnads ] ) and obtain @xmath219 the numerator in ( [ cinfty ] ) is necessarily positive due to condition ( [ horizon ] ) , that @xmath76 must obey to represent the event horizon radius .",
    "therefore , the stability condition for these solutions is simply @xmath220 .",
    "notice that equation ( [ cinfty ] ) is a generalization to @xmath221 of the heat capacity found by hawking and page in @xcite .",
    "computing the action in this limit yields @xmath222 this is precisely hawking - page action @xcite , which here we have recovered from york s formalism taking the appropriate limit .    from equation ( [ iinfty ] )",
    ", we can verify the global stability of the black hole by imposing that @xmath223 .",
    "therefore we conclude that the solution given by ( @xmath224 ) corresponds to a globally stable black hole if conditions @xmath225 and ( [ horizon ] ) are both verified .",
    "these conditions are similar to those found in @xcite .",
    "we conclude that taking different boundary conditions , i.e. choosing to fix the boundary conditions in the boundary at infinity ( as done here ) or in the region where spacetime is flat like hawking and page @xcite , yields a different value for the energy only .",
    "furthermore this difference is so that all the other physical quantities ( like the action , entropy , mean - value of the charge and heat capacity ) remain the same .    on the other hand",
    ", we can take a different limit : ( ii ) we can fix the boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath41 and @xmath40 , when taking the limit .",
    "this is done by recovering the variables @xmath41 and @xmath206 in equation ( [ x^5 ] ) , using ( [ newrnads ] ) . taking the limit @xmath211",
    ", we obtain the equation @xmath226 .",
    "this is a 5th degree equation in @xmath100 . for fixed @xmath41 , @xmath40 and @xmath206 and taking the limit @xmath211",
    ", we obtain a solution @xmath76 that tends to infinity like @xmath227 , where @xmath228 is a constant that depends only on @xmath41 , @xmath40 and @xmath206 .",
    "considering now equation ( [ q(x)rnads ] ) , we can see that the charge @xmath47 goes to infinity as @xmath229 , where again @xmath230 is a constant that depends only on @xmath41 , @xmath40 and @xmath206 .",
    "therefore the entropy ( [ srnads ] ) and the mean - value of the charge ( [ qrnads ] ) both go to infinity as @xmath231 . in this",
    "limit the action , the thermal energy and the heat capacity , given in ( [ irnads ] ) , ( [ ernads ] ) and ( [ est2rnads ] ) respectively , also diverge as @xmath231 .",
    "the heat capacity is always positive , which means these solutions are stable .",
    "the action is always positive , therefore the solutions are not globally stable and represent metastable black holes .",
    "several black holes may be considered as special cases of the reissner - nordstrm - anti - de  sitter black hole .",
    "( i ) : :    putting @xmath115 and @xmath45 , we obtain    the schwarzschild black hole studied in @xcite .",
    "there are two    solutions for @xmath232 .",
    "this solutions can be computed analytically ,    since equation ( [ x^5 ] ) becomes a 3rd degree equation for    @xmath45 .",
    "only the solution with higher event horizon    radius , i.e. higher mass , is stable .",
    "+    in the limit @xmath211 the unstable solution , i.e.    the solution with lower value of the horizon radius , goes to    @xmath233 , while the stable solution goes to    infinity as @xmath234 @xcite .",
    "( ii ) : :    putting @xmath45 we obtain the reissner - nordstrm black    hole .",
    "this has been studied in @xcite .",
    "there are one or two solution    for @xmath235 .",
    "these as    stated above can be computed analytically . once again only the    solution with higher event horizon radius , when it exists , is stable .",
    "+    in the limit @xmath211 , the black hole horizon    radius is @xmath236 and the charge is given by    @xmath237 .",
    "the thermal energy of these solutions is    equal to their adm mass @xmath218 .",
    "the heat capacity is    negative @xmath238 .",
    "therefore the solutions are unstable .",
    "( iii ) : :    putting @xmath115 we obtain the    schwarzschild - anti - de  sitter . this black hole has been studied before    in @xcite .",
    "this black hole has two solutions for    @xmath239 , and again only the one with    higher event horizon radius is stable .",
    "+    the limit @xmath211 can be taken in two ways :    ( @xmath90 ) fixing the temperature and the cosmological    constant , there are one unstable solution that tends to zero as    @xmath240 and one stable solution that tends to infinity as    @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the solution of equation    @xmath243 ; ( @xmath92 )    fixing the horizon radius @xmath76 , the temperature goes to    zero as @xmath244 , these solutions are    stable if @xmath245 , see @xcite .",
    "( iv ) : :    the extremal cases require special care @xcite and were    not studied in any detail in this paper .",

    "we have found one or two black hole solutions depending on the boundary conditions and the value of the cosmological constant . in general",
