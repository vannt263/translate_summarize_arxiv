    "the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is one of the most important questions in particle physics and will likely lead to the discovery of new organizing principles beyond the standard model . as we enter the era of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) with the promise of new discoveries of new states in nature , it remains nonetheless unclear how much of the deeper organizing context for ewsb can be understood at the tev scale .",
    "for instance , consider solutions of the gauge hierarchy problem involving theories with a compact extra dimension in ads space  @xcite .",
    "these are thought to be a dual description of a large-@xmath0 , @xmath1 , strongly coupled sector characterized by conformal dynamics  @xcite . the low energy spectrum , however , is typically populated by an assortment of new vector resonances with various standard model quantum numbers , and possibly new heavy fermions .",
    "we might then seek probes that could reveal the deeper uv completion structure .",
    "these can arise from anomalous , or ",
    "topological \" processes , associated with the gauge dynamics of chiral fermions , much like the low energy process , @xmath2 , counts the quark colors in qcd .",
    "chiral fermions are required as part of the low energy spectrum of any model , often arising by chiral localizations in extra dimensional models , whereby left - handed fermions occur at one place in the bulk , whilst their right - handed anomaly - canceling partners occur elsewhere .",
    "this has immediate implications for the anomaly structure of such theories , or more properly , the chern - simons ( cs ) term structure .",
    "the cs term propagates the anomaly from one chiral fermion to another and maintains the anomaly cancellation across the extra dimension .",
    "although it is well understood that anomalies in orbifold theories are brane - localized and canceled by a suitable bulk cs term , the associated observable consequences of cs terms have not been fully elaborated in the literature .",
    "this is important since the associated cs interactions , involving gauge kk - modes , point to fundamental aspects of the underlying theory in analogy to @xmath2 in qcd .",
    "anomalies and cs terms in extra dimensional models have been previously considered in the literature .",
    "these descend from gauge boson solitons that are topological objects , such as the instantonic vortex , arising in @xmath3 and whose conserved currents are generated by the cs term @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , deconstruction was used to show how anomalies are canceled in theory space by the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) terms present on each link , as well as illustrating the appearance of the cs term in the continuum limit of a flat compact extra dimension ( see also  @xcite ) . to cancel anomalies in orbifold theories with delocalized chiral zero modes",
    ", cs terms must necessarily occur .",
    "cs terms , in turn , produce physical consequences : in @xmath4 qed the cs term yields a mass for the photon and destroys dirac magnetic monopoles ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "likewise , in @xmath3 , cs terms lead to observable physical effects , first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , as a general consequence , they violate kk - parities .",
    "this is analogous to the violation of @xmath5 spurious pion parity in a chiral lagrangian of mesons by the wzw term in qcd .",
    "these physical effects can most easily be understood by considering three very massive @xmath3 bulk kk - mode wave - packets each vanishing on the branes where the fermions are localized .",
    "the bulk cs term operator will generally have a non - vanishing overlap integral for such wave - packets , provided overall kk - mode parity is odd .",
    "the pure cs term in the bulk controls these interactions . for lower kk modes , whose wave - functions touch the fermionic branes , the loop diagrams of the localized fermions become relevant , leading to the counterterm structure that enforces , e.g. , vector - like current conservation @xcite ( or , alternatively , chiral current conservation , with the appropriate counterterm @xcite ) .",
    "this observation has been applied in refs.@xcite to little higgs theories , which can be viewed as deconstructed extra dimensional theories . aside from identifying certain special processes in electron or muon collider experiments that probe cs terms , a key result is that it is generally difficult to maintain a stable dark matter kk - mode candidate in the presence of cs terms .",
    "this is an effect that will recur in the present paper .",
    "some aspects of anomalies in warped extra dimension models were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we will consider the remnant topological interactions at low energy resulting from bulk chern - simons terms in theories with warped extra dimensions . in order to clarify the origin of these new interactions amongst kk gauge bosons we first deconstruct  @xcite these theories (",
    "this was previously done in refs .",

    "this can be viewed as descending from a vector - like @xmath10 @xmath3 yang - mills bulk theory with chiral localizations generated by domain walls .",
    "a cs term is present in @xmath3 and becomes the wzw term in @xmath1 that compensates the quarks consistent anomalies on the walls .",
    "the wzw term contains trilinear and quadrilinear `` pcs '' terms @xcite at this stage , but when the quarks are integrated out , a bardeen counterterm is generated , conserving the vector currents , enforcing the landau - yang theorem and annihilating the pcs terms . in a three site model even with quarks integrated out and conserved zero - mode vector currents , the pcs terms involving higher kk - modes remain .",
    "note that one can modify the counterterm when the @xmath11 , or @xmath12 currents are conserved , as in standard model gauging .",
    "this is then not a vector - like scheme . ] .",
    "these first appear in deconstructions with three or more sites .",
    "this has important consequences in the phenomenology of these interactions in the continuum limit , most notably the fact that  as long as the zero - mode gauge symmetry remains unbroken",
    " these interactions must involve the second kk mode of the gauge boson . amongst the various interactions",
    "the most accessible involves the gluon and its first and second kk modes .",
    "this results in a new decay mode for the second kk mode : @xmath13 , which gives a non - negligible contribution to the @xmath14 width .",
    "it also allows for the associated production process @xmath15 to be observable at the lhc as long as the kk masses are not too heavy , as is the case , for instance , in warped higgsless models .",
    "we will show that the requirement that a second kk mode be present can be circumvented when one of the gauge bosons in the interaction is associated with a broken gauge symmetry .",
    "this leads to many new interactions involving the @xmath16 boson with kk gauge bosons and other zero modes .",
    "we will study the phenomenology of the most promising interactions , including the one involving a gluon and its two first kk modes , as well as one with a gluon , its first kk mode and the @xmath16 .",
    "finally , we consider a proposed warped extra dimension scenario with kk parity @xcite and show that the topological interactions do not break this symmetry , and still allow for a stable dark matter candidate in the lightest kk - odd particle .    in the next section we consider in detail the deconstruction @xcite of a warped @xmath3 theory including fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "a complete treatment of fermions in warped extra dimension theories is not present in the literature and is central for our derivations . in deconstruction",
    ", the cs term becomes a sum over interlinking wzw terms . in unitary gauge , where all kk - modes eat their corresponding nambu - goldstone bosons ( the link field phases ) the sum over wzw terms immediately reduces to the discretized version of the cs term .",
    "none of this makes any sense , however , without utilizing wilson fermions in deconstructed theories .",
    "we make use of the wilson fermion action for warped theories , first introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , and further developed here .",

    "@xcite , where we also explicitly show how anomaly cancellation works . in section  [ ioutfermions ] we show that the existence and detailed form of the induced topological interactions depend on the localization of zero - mode fermions . in section  [ topproc ]",
    "we derive the remnant processes of interest for phenomenological applications : interactions among three vector states involving kaluza - klein modes of the gauge bosons .",
    "we show how these interactions arise from the chern - simons terms paying particular attention to gauge invariance .",

    "the kk - parity odd combination @xmath135 gets a dirac mass with @xmath131 . in the end , after integrating out all heavy fermions we have one massless left - handed mode localized on the zeroth site and one massless right - handed mode distributed equally on the @xmath133-th site and the @xmath0-th site , in addition to the wzw terms .",
    "then , when going to the continuum limit we have a theory with massless chiral fermions and kk gauge bosons , with topological interactions among them .",
    "these include the local cs terms resulting from integrating out the @xmath129 kk tower , as well as the non - local terms induced by the triangle diagrams with the zero modes and the odd kk modes .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : topointeractionkkparity ] : the upper non - local interactions are from triangular contributions from the massless fermion zero modes .",
    "the lower non - local interactions come from integrating out the @xmath131 and @xmath135 .        summing all topological interactions and in the unitary gauge ,",
    "we arrive at the following gauge invariant action -s_topo&=&(y)adada",
    "+ d^4x + & & + d^4x , [ eq : topointeractionkkparity ] with the function @xmath136 for @xmath137 and @xmath138 for @xmath139 .",
    "thus we see that the resulting non - vanishing topological interactions are even under the @xmath17 transformation @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , kk parity is still a good symmetry in this model . as a consequence , the potential dark matter candidate proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite would remain stable if the only topological interactions present are those generated by integrating out the fermion spectrum as shown above .",
    "although the @xmath17 symmetry in this model can remain unbroken , its origin does not appear to be associated with the symmetry of an orbifold geometry as it is in universal extra dimensions ( ued )  @xcite . in the ued case",
    "the @xmath17 symmetry is purely geometric , and is defined about the middle point of the orbifold which does not play a dynamical role . here",
    ", the symmetry is obtained by attaching two identical orbifolds at the uv brane .",
    "this amounts to making an assumption about the dynamics of the middle point where the uv brane is located , and appears to be similar to imposing an ad hoc matter parity as is done in other models .",
    "extra dimensional theories with chiral zero modes are rendered non - anomalous by the addition of bulk chern - simons terms . using deconstruction methods",
    "we have shown that these terms not only cancel the localized anomalies but also lead to remnant interactions among gauge kk and zero modes . in a purely four - dimensional interpretation",
    ", they involve the vector mesons of a global symmetry which is partially gauged .",
    "we derived our results in the limits of extreme fermion localization , which in the deconstructed language corresponds to taking the ratio of fermion masses to link vevs , @xmath141 , either to @xmath142 or to infinity .",
    "these simplifying assumptions allowed us to obtain the remnant topological interactions in a closed form in the continuum limit .",
    "however , it is clear from our derivation that their presence is a generic feature of these theories .",
    "we can also conclude from this simplified treatment that the topological interactions will depend on the zero - mode fermion bulk profile , as attested by the fact that when both chiralities are localized on the same brane there are none , whereas if the chiral zero - modes are localized at opposite ends of the orbifold they are present .",
    "the more generic case , for finite values of @xmath141 corresponding to zero - mode fermions with bulk profiles , does not lend itself to a simple form in the continuum limit , and it will be presented elsewhere  @xcite . here , we used our simplified result to approximate the most important contribution to these terms in warped extra dimension models , which comes from the zero - mode top quark .",
    "we consider the effects as coming from an ir - localized @xmath143 , and a uv - localized @xmath144 , assuming that all other zero modes are uv - localized .",
    "this approximation should give a reasonable estimate of the effects in more realistic models of zero - mode localization .",
    "even then , we must notice that the answer still is dependent of details of the fermion content of the model , such as the embedding of fermions in the 5d bulk .",
    "such was the case when computing the strength of the interactions in section  [ pheno ] leading to @xmath145 and @xmath146 processes .",
    "a different embedding for the right - handed multiplets in the bulk would have led to different values of @xmath147 and @xmath148 in ( [ eq : higgslesscoupling ] ) and ( [ threeg ] ) respectively .    in the deconstruction description we showed how for two - site models there are no remnant interactions , whereas already in the three - site models these are present . in the continuum limit , this manifest itself in the fact that for the remnant interactions to be non - zero the minimum interaction must involve a zero mode , plus first and second kk modes , as shown in section  [ topproc ] .",
    "the remnant topological interactions lead to novel physical processes .",
    "we have shown how to derive these for constructions involving abelian , non - abelian as well as product gauge groups relevant in various model - building scenarios in warped extra dimensions .",
    "in particular , we considered the interaction involving the first and second kk modes of the gluon with the gluon zero mode , @xmath145 , deriving from the cs terms that cancel the @xmath149 ^ 3 $ ] anomaly .",
    "this is the most un - suppressed topological interaction in warped extra dimension models , due both to the largest possible product of gauge couplings as well as to the enhancement of the wave - function overlap among kk modes .",
    "the strength of this interaction is large enough to make it a visible decay mode of the @xmath14 for the choice of parameters used here , corresponding to a uv - localized @xmath144 and an ir - localized @xmath143 .",
    "we also used this interaction to estimate the cross section for @xmath150 , plotted in figure  [ fig : productioncs ] as a function of @xmath151 .",
    "this interaction is present in all warped extra dimension models and does not depend on the details of electroweak symmetry breaking . on the other hand , as we can see from figure  [ fig : productioncs ] , the cross section is large enough to be observed at the lhc only for models with @xmath151 not far above @xmath152tev , as it is the case in higgsless models .",
    "this implies that in higgsless models the process @xmath150 induced by the topological interaction @xmath145 can be observed at the lhc .",
    "the final state would consist of four top quarks and a hard gluon jet , with two of the top quarks and the jet reconstructing to @xmath153 and the other two top quarks reconstructing to @xmath151 .",
    "many other processes are induced by the topological interactions . as examples , we considered the topological interactions induced by the @xmath149 ^ 2\\,u(1)_y$ ] cs terms leading to the @xmath154 vertex .",
    "we study the phenomenology of such a unique interaction for different choices of boundary conditions relevant for warped models with or without a higgs in section  [ pheno ] .",
    "we conclude that these coupling are too small to be observable at the lhc , unless the couplings of @xmath155 to zero - mode fermions are highly suppressed .",
    "finally , we have also studied the warped extra dimension model with kk parity , as proposed in ref .",
    "we showed that , unlike in the case of little higgs theories with t parity , the remnant topological interactions generated by integrating out kk fermions do not break kk parity .",
    "thus , and as long as it is assumed that the 5d theory has no chern - simons terms , the lightest kk - odd particle remains stable .",
    "other processes can be easily derived by following the procedure presented in section  [ topproc ] .",
    "for instance , the @xmath149 ^ 2\\,u(1)_y$ ] cs terms also induce the vertex @xmath156 .",
    "although its coupling is smaller than that of @xmath157 , the fact that it does not involve a second kk mode may result in a phenomenologically relevant mechanism for @xmath158 production .",
    "also potentially interesting are purely electroweak interactions coming from @xmath159 ^ 2u(1)$ ] cs terms , resulting in couplings such as @xmath160 , which in higgsless models are not suppressed by wave - function factors .    among the processes we have not considered are those involving gravitons and their kk modes , generated by the cancellation of gravitational anomalies .",
    "to obtain these would require the deconstruction of gravity  @xcite in a warped extra dimension theory , an interesting problem in and on itself regardless of its phenomenological applications .",
    "finally , we have not made an exhaustive study of the topological interactions in all warped extra dimension scenarios .",
    "for instance , it would be interesting to consider the form of these interactions in gauge - higgs unification models  @xcite .    in sum , the observation of topological interactions as the ones studied here would point to fundamental aspects of the physics underlying the discoveries of new massive gauge bosons at the lhc .",
    "we hope that this work can be the basis for more detailed phenomenological studies of the collider signals of these topological terms .",
