    "the collection of string models of ruled quartic surfaces , present at some mathematical institutes ( for instance at the department of mathematics in groningen ) is the direct motivation for this paper .",
    "this series xiii , produced by martin schilling in 1886 , is based upon a paper of k.  rohn @xcite containing a classification of ruled quartic surfaces over @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "some authors before rohn ( e.g. , m. chasles @xcite , a. cayley @xcite , l. cremona @xcite , r. sturm @xcite , g. salmon @xcite ) and many after his time ( e.g. , b.c .",
    "wong @xcite , h. mohrmann @xcite , w.fr .",
    "meyer @xcite , w.l .",
    "edge @xcite , o. bottema @xcite , t. urabe @xcite ) have contributed to this beautiful topic of 19th century geometry .",
    "+ cremona classified the ruled quartic surfaces in 12 types .",
    "he states in @xcite that cayley produced 8 of these without revealing his method .",
    "however , cayley s third memoir on this subject @xcite was written earlier the same year 1868 and contains 10 types .",
    "in an addition to this memoir ( may 18 , 1869 ) , cayley gives the comparison between his own classification and the one by cremona and makes it clear what the two types he missed are .",
    "the method of cayley consists of taking three curves in @xmath5 and to consider the ruled surface @xmath6 which is the union of the lines meeting all three curves . using a formula for the degree of @xmath6 , he now computes possibilities of ruled quartic surfaces .",
    "the expression ` the six coordinates of a line ' in cayley s work indicates that the grassmann variety @xmath7 of the lines in @xmath5 plays a role .",
    "the work of cayley contains also explicit calculations for reciprocal surfaces ( see below ) .",
    "+ the results of cremona can be explained as follows .",
    "let @xmath8 be a ruled quartic surface ( reduced , irreducible and defined over @xmath3 ) .",
    "the fact that through a general point of @xmath6 there is only one line of @xmath6 is tacitly assumed ( compare lemma  [ 1.2.2 ] ) .",
    "the locus @xmath9 of the points on @xmath6 through which there are at least two lines of @xmath6 ( in the 1-parameter family ) is called the ` double curve ' .",
    "cremona states that @xmath9 is indeed a curve ( hereby excluding cones ) and has ` in general ' degree 3 .",
    "( we note that @xmath9 need not coincide with the singular locus of @xmath6 , that @xmath9 can also have degree 2 ( see _ number _",
    "@xmath10 in subsection  [ s1.6 ] ) and that @xmath11 is possible ; compare , for example , corollary  [ 1.2.7](2 ) . )    two intersecting lines on @xmath6 determine a plane .",
    "the collection @xmath12 of all these planes is called the ` bitangent developable ' .",
    "this 1-dimensional family ( assuming @xmath13 ) can be seen as a curve in the dual projective space .",
    "the genus of @xmath6 is defined as the genus of the ( irreducible , singular ) curve @xmath14 of degree 4 , where @xmath15 is a general plane .",
    "cremona states that the genus can only be @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "missing is the nontrivial argument showing that genus 2 is impossible ( see observation  [ 1.2.obs ] and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.6 ) ) .",
    "cremona classifies @xmath6 according to the nature ( degrees and multiplicities of the irreducible components ) of the curves @xmath9 and @xmath12 ( and in one case a relation between @xmath9 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "he obtains his list of possibilities via the following construction : + consider a tuple @xmath18 consisting of two conics @xmath19 , not in the same plane , and an isomorphism @xmath20 .",
    "this defines a ruled surface @xmath6 which is the union of the lines through the pairs of points @xmath21 with @xmath22 . in the general case , the line @xmath23 , where @xmath24 lies in the plane @xmath25 for @xmath26 , intersects @xmath27 in two points @xmath28 and intersects @xmath29 in two points @xmath30 .",
    "now @xmath31 is the union of the conic @xmath29 and the two lines through the pairs of points @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "thus @xmath6 is an irreducible ruled surface of degree 4 .",
    "moreover , the two lines intersect in a point of the ` double curve ' and @xmath34 is a ` bitangent plane ' , i.e. , a point on the ` bitangent developable . '",
    "the same holds of course for @xmath35 .",
    "cremona s examples are obtained by varying and degenerating @xmath36 .",
    "his assertion to have found all types in this way is not correct since some ruled quartic surfaces are only obtained from a line and a curve of degree 3 .",
    "however by including ` reciprocal surfaces ' and maybe stretching the meaning of ` degeneration ' some of the latter surfaces can be obtained .",
    "the approach of cayley ( and of rohn ) has the classical name `` analytic geometry '' , indicating the use of coordinates and algebraic operations with formulas .",
    "in contrast , cremona s ( and sturm s ) approach is purely `` synthetic '' . as a consequence ,",
    "cremona s paper is difficult to read and it is hard to verify the results .",
    "bottema @xcite remarks that rohn claims to have discovered a type overlooked by his predecessors .",
    "indeed , on p.  147 of rohn s paper @xcite , there is an explicit equation and the remark in a footnote : `` this ruled surface is not mentioned by cremona in his treatise '' .",
    "however , it is easy to verify that rohn s equation ( in the homogeneous coordinates @xmath37 ) @xmath38 does _ not _ define a ruled surface , since a general point @xmath39 on it is not contained in any line of the surface . actually , rohn s geometric construction is valid but his formula happens to be mistaken .",
    "the construction gives indeed a case which is not explicitly mentioned by cremona .",
    "however it can be interpreted as hiding in cremona s species 10 .",
    "pascal s well written repertorium reviews the classification of cayley and cremona , @xcite , xii ,  10 .",
    "here rohn s extra case reappears on p.  338",
    "- 339 with the same correct geometric construction and another mistake in the formula . in the classification of the present paper rohn s example is _ number _ 5 .",
    "there are also critical comments by r. sturm to the list of cremona .",
    "moreover , some of the 12 species of cremona contain surfaces of a rather different nature , as we will see in section  [ section3 ] .",
    "the classification of ruled quartic surfaces in the book of w.l .",
    "edge @xcite is identical with the one of cremona .",
    "two methods are developed there .",
    "the first one classifies the curves ( irreducible and of degree 4 ) , corresponding to ruled quartic surfaces , in the grassmann variety @xmath7 ( parametrizing the 2-dimensional subspaces of a 4-dimensional vector , or , equivalently , the lines in @xmath5 ) .",
    "the second method obtains the ruled quartic surfaces in @xmath5 as projections of certain ruled quartic surfaces in @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "this is related to a paper of c. segre @xcite and to a paper by swinnerton  dyer@xcite .",
    "+ in the thesis of wong @xcite , a rational morphism @xmath42 , associated to the classical ` tetrahedral complex ' , is considered .",
    "certain plane curves in @xmath5 of degree 2 and 3 have as images in @xmath7 curves of degree 4 and correspond therefore to ruled quartic surfaces .",
    "it is claimed in this thesis that every ` species ' in cremona s list can be obtained in this way . + for other details on the early history of the subject we refer to the contribution of w.fr .",
    "meyer in @xcite . + a ruled surface in modern terminology ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section v.2 . ) ) , is a morphism @xmath43 of a smooth projective surface @xmath44 to a smooth curve @xmath45 such that all fibres are isomorphic to @xmath46 . a classical ruled surface @xmath8 is obtained as the image of a suitable morphism @xmath47 .",
    "this method and the papers of t. urabe @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite may lead to a modern classification of ruled quartic surfaces ( including moduli ) .",
    "we note , in passing , that urabe s important work concerns the discovery of new aspects in the classification of the singularities of quartic surfaces in @xmath5 ( which , generally , are not ruled ) and their relation to dynkin diagrams .",
    "+ one aim of the present paper is to give a modern treatment of rohn s paper @xcite , namely the`symmetrization ' of curves in @xmath0 of bi - degree @xmath1 and the classification of some ruled quartic surfaces over @xmath4 .",
    "the latter is used to obtain explicit equations explaining the visual features of the models of series xiii .",
    "+ the possibilities for the 1-dimensional part of the singular locus of a ruled surface @xmath6 can be read off from the intersection of @xmath6 with a general plane .",
    "this leads to the elegant elementary treatment of ruled cubic surfaces in dolgachev s book @xcite . as a didactical step towards ruled quartic surfaces , we present here another method valid over any base field and obtain the three types of ruled cubic surfaces over @xmath4",
    "the other aim of this paper is to present a classification of the quartic ruled surfaces , such that each class is determined by discrete data and the surfaces belonging to a given class give rise to a connected moduli space .",
    "this leads to @xmath48 cases .",
    "a combination of the following methods leads to this classification . +",

    "the normalization @xmath50 of @xmath45 carries a vector bundle of rank two . in case",
    "the genus of @xmath50 is 0 , there are two possibilities for this vector bundle .",
    "two ` generating ' meromorphic sections of this vector bundle are brought in some standard form , by some linear base changes .",
    "this leads to explicit equations for the corresponding quartic ruled surfaces .",
    "classification of the position of @xmath45 w.r.t .",
    "the tangent spaces of @xmath7 .",
    "+ part ( 4 ) is in fact one of the two methods of @xcite in deriving cremona s list .",
    "although we could not verify this in detail because of a certain vagueness in edge s arguments , the results agree with our computations . + before giving cremona s list we need to explain to notion of ` _ reciprocal surface _ ' or ` _ dual surface _ ' in more modern terms , of a surface @xmath8 .",
    "it is obtained by considering all tangent planes at the nonsingular points of @xmath6 .",
    "each tangent plane is a point in the dual projective space @xmath51 .",
    "the zariski closure of all these points is the dual surface @xmath52 . in the case that @xmath6 is ruled , also @xmath53 is ruled and has the same degree as @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , the ` double line ' of @xmath53 can be seen to be the ` bitangent developable ' .",
    "cremona s list shows that the species 3 and 4 are dual , as well as the species 7 and 8 .",
    "the other species are ` selfdual ' . in the table",
    "one has to give ` double curve ' the interpretation ` singular locus ' .",
    "the genus @xmath54 of the surface is 0 , except for cremona 11 , 12 where it is 1 .",
    "we adopt a _ notation of cayley _ , namely the expression @xmath55 stands for an irreducible component of the singular locus of degree @xmath56 and with multiplicity @xmath57 .",
    "the difference between cremona 6 and cremona 11 is that the two lines intersect in the first case and are skew in the second one .",
    "the difference between cremona 9 and cremona 10 is somewhat subtle . in case 10",
    "the bitangent planes are the planes containing the singular line , denoted by @xmath17 . in case 9 , the bitangent planes are the planes containing another line , denoted by @xmath58 .",
