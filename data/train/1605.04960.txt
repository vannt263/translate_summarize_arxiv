    "the importance of mountain - generated inertia - gravity waves for the atmospheric circulation has long been recognised ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) , and their parameterisation is now an essential element of weather - forecasting and climate models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "their oceanic counterparts , while often neglected , are now increasingly thought to play a significant role for the oceanic circulation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these waves impact both the atmospheric and oceanic circulations through the drag they extert where they dissipate , often through their interaction with the large - scale flow at critical levels where the mean flow velocity vanishes or , accounting for the background rotation , at inertial levels where their doppler - shifted frequency matches the local coriolis frequency .",
    "our understanding of this form of interaction with the mean flow rests on a number of now classical papers ( including * ? ? ?",

    "* ) that tackled both the propagation of the waves in a shear flow and the drag they exert on the flow .",
    "these identified the eliassen ",
    "palm ( ep ) flux ( or pseudomomentum flux ) as the key quantity controlling the drag , showed that its conservation in the absence of dissipation leads to non - interaction results @xcite , and elucidated how critical - level and inertial - level singularities disrupt this conservation and result in drag .",
    "these results have subsequently been applied to a variety of mountain shapes and flows .",
    "the present paper focusses on the case of a topographic profile with two well - separated horizontal scales , with small - scale oscillations modulated over a large envelope scale .",
    "topographies of this form are assumed in atmospheric - model parameterizations @xcite and are natural for the ocean , e.g. , in ridge regions .",
    "our aim is to provide a detailed description of the wavepacket generated by a relatively weak flow whose rossby number based on the envelope scale is small .",
    "the rossby number based on the oscillation scale is however large enough for the waves to be vertically propagating ( rather than evanescent ) from the ground up .",
    "the flow considered is back sheared , decreasing linearly from a positive value at the ground to a zero - velocity critical level higher up .",
    "such a monotonic decrease is not particularly realistic , since real flows are more typically non - monotonic and critical levels , e.g. in the middle atmosphere , are the result of shear reversals .",
    "however , the important wave dynamics that we intend to capture is localized around the inertial levels and unaffected by the details of the propagation below , which are well described by standard ray tracing .",
    "background rotation is crucial in two respects for the problem considered : first , it contributes to the dispersion relation ; second , it determines the nature of the singularities in the vertical structure of the wave solution .",
    "specifically , rotation resolves the degeneracy of the critical level singularity , which is independent of wavenumber , into a pair of wavenumber - dependent inertial levels . as a result ,",
    "the singularities associated with the broad wavenumber spectrum of a wavepacket are smeared out over a range of altitude  the inertial layer  and the wavepacket solution itself is smooth in the limit of vanishing dissipation @xcite .",
    "( an analogous effect arises when the orientation of the flow changes with altitude , see @xcite . )",
    "we tackle the three essential aspects of the problem by computing ( i ) the shape of the wavepacket , ( ii ) the associated ep flux , and ( iii ) the mean - flow change that results from the divergence of this ep flux .",
    "we take advantage of the assumption of small rossby number and of a related assumption of large richardson number to carry out the entire computation asymptotically , relying on the wkb form of the vertical structure of plane waves in the horizontal obtained by @xcite .",
    "the analysis identifies two distinct altitude ranges corresponding to two distinct asymptotic regimes . in the first ,",
    "valid away from the inertial levels , standard ray tracing applies and the ( horizontally integrated ) ep flux is independent of altitude ; in the second , valid in a thin region surrounding the inertial layer , the solution is more complicated and captures the finiteness of the wavepacket deflection as it approaches a central inertial level .",
    "it turns out that inertial - level absorption affects only a still thinner region , which defines an inertial layer .",
    "the mean drag is vertically localised in this layer .    the asymptotic approach provides answers to basic questions  such as the horizontal distance between mountain and region of wave drag , and the extent of this region  as scaling laws in terms of key parameters characterising the stratification , shear and mountain shape .",
    "these scaling relations , which likely apply to more general setups than the one we consider , may prove useful for the representation of moutain - wave drag in numerical models .",
    "we also emphasise that our approach provides a fully consistent treatment of wave  mean flow interaction in a non - symmetric setup , with small - scale averaging replacing the more familiar zonal averaging .",
    "this is in contrast with the earlier , heuristic treatment of @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we formulate the problem in  [ formulation ] and approximate the form of the wavepacket in different regimes using a steepest - descent method in  [ wave_solu ] . in  [ sec_wm ]",
    "we use this approximation to calculate the ep flux and solve a mean quasi - geostrophic potential - vorticity equation to obtain the mean - flow response .",
    "we summarise and discuss our results in  [ conclusion ] .",

    "we consider the interaction between a steady topographic wavepacket and a background shear flow in an idealized setup shown in fig .",

    "it proves convenient to use a slightly unusual vertical coordinate such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 correspond to the critical level and ground , respectively .",
    "the topographic wavepacket is generated by an idealized multiscale mountain with height @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the dominant wavevector , @xmath15 is the maximum height of the mountain , and @xmath16 denotes the real part . here",

    "we apply a no - normal flow boundary condition at the lower boundary : @xmath27 where the subscript `` @xmath28 '' denotes the value on the boundary .",
    "we examine small - amplitude waves governed by the linearization of the primitive equations ( [ priequ])([bc ] ) about the background flow .",
    "this is in geostrophic balance and given by @xmath29 we assume a small rossby number based on the envelope scale @xmath2 of the topography : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath32 , corresponding to an order - one burger number based on the horizontal and vertical scales @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "together with ( [ smallrossby ] ) , this implies a large richardson number , specifically @xmath33 where we have introduced the parameter @xmath34 as a convenient substitute for the richardson number @xmath35 .",
    "we are interested in mountain waves , in the distinguished regime where the doppler - shifted frequency @xmath36 is of the same order as the coriolis frequency .",
    "this corresponds to the scaling @xmath37 with @xmath38 a rossby number based on the mountain wavelength rather than the envelope scale that appears in @xmath39 . since @xmath40",
    ", this implies that @xmath41 to ensure that the waves are propagating rather than evanescent at the bottom boundary we further require that @xmath42 we emphasise that the scaling specified by ( [ smallrossby ] ) , ( [ jscale ] ) and ( [ kdscale ] ) corresponds to a distinguished limit , that is , it leads to results valid for a broad range of relative values of @xmath39 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this becomes apparent in the asymptotic derivation of  [ sec : saddles ] and is discussed further in the conclusion ,  [ conclusion ] .",
    "linearizing ( [ priequ ] ) around the background flow ( [ bgflow ] ) leads to the equations    [ wavepri ] @xmath45    with @xmath46 the unit vector in the @xmath47-direction , which govern the leading - order wave fields , denoted here by the subscript `` 1 '' .",
    "the amplitude of the waves is determined by the linearisation of the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) around the background flow ( [ bgflow ] ) , @xmath48 this indicates that @xmath49 . the polarization relation for standard internal waves",
    "( see also ( [ hatu ] ) below ) can then be used to estimate @xmath50 .",
    "the linearization based on the small - amplitude condition @xmath51 thus requires that the inverse froude number be small : @xmath52 based on this small parameter , we introduce the convention of using a subscript ` @xmath53 ' ( @xmath54 ) to denote the @xmath53th - order flow variables such that @xmath55    after applying a fourier transform , ( [ wavepri ] ) can be reduced to the single equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "( this is equation ( 25 ) in @xcite and equation ( 4 ) in @xcite . )",
    "the independent variable is the scaled vertical coordinate @xmath58 we emphasise that for @xmath59 , as will be assumed when interpreting the results , @xmath60 has a sign opposite to that of @xmath61 and is positive below the inertial level and increasing downwards .",
    "the dependent variable @xmath62 is the horizontal fourier transform of @xmath63 , defined by @xmath64 the other dependent variables are related to @xmath62 through the polarization relations    [ polrel ] @xmath65    one of the key characteristics of igws in shear flow is the presence of singularities : two inertial levels , where the doppler - shifted frequency matches the coriolis frequency , and a critical level , where the doppler - shifted frequency and hence the background velocity vanish @xcite .",
    "these singularities are readily identified from ( [ waveeq ] ) : the two inertial levels and one critical level correspond to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "the critical level is an apparent singularity that can be removed by a variable transformation .",
    "the inertial levels , by contrast , have a marked physical impact since the wave solution switches abruptly from an oscillatory to an evanescent behaviour and back across them @xcite . as we discuss in  [ sec_wm ] , this abrupt change underpins the forcing of a mean flow by the wavepacket .",
    "rotation plays a crucial role .",
    "the position @xmath68 of the inertial levels depends on the wavenumber @xmath69 ; as a result , the singularities associated with each wavenumber making up the wavepacket are smeared out over a range of altitude , and the wavepacket solution is smooth even in the absence of dissipation ( or more precisely in the limit of vanishing dissipation since dissipation is important to determine physically relevant branches of solution ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the non - rotating scenario , best thought of as the limit @xmath70 of the general situation . in this limit ,",
    "the inertial levels coalesce with the critical level , leading to a stronger , @xmath69-independent singularity and to a singular behaviour of the wavepacket unless dissipation is introduced .",
    "( a similar smearing out of singularities across different altitudes also occurs without rotation when more complicated flows , such as the directional shear flow , are considered ; @xcite , @xcite . )    the term ` inertial layer ' is used to describe the region where the effect of the inertial - level singularities is distributed .",
    "it is centred around the dominant inertial level , @xmath71 determined by the central wavenumber @xmath72 of the topography .",
    "note that , for the problem under consideration , only the lower inertial levels matter since the waves are exponentially small in @xmath43 at the upper inertial levels .",
    "condition ( [ prop ] ) ensures that @xmath73 , that is , the dominant inertial level lies in the fluid domain .",
    "the characteristic thickness of the inertial layer is found as @xmath74 on using that , according to expression ( [ mountain ] ) for the mountain height , the spectral width of the wavepacket is @xmath75 .    equation ( [ waveeq ] ) for @xmath76 can be solved explicitly in terms of hypergeometric functions @xcite .",
    "we rely instead on the approximate wkb solution derived in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and valid in the large - richardson limit @xmath77 . in this solution , @xmath76 is approximated as @xmath78 where @xmath79 note that we have normalized @xmath76 so that its bottom - boundary value is @xmath80 .     expression ( [ vertial_str0 ] ) holds for all real values of @xmath60 except in small regions of @xmath81 thickness around the inertial levels @xmath66 .",
    "the sign of the argument of the exponential is taken to be negative because this ensures that the wave is propagating upwards above the upper inertial level , that is , for @xmath82 ( see @xcite ; note that the opposite , positive sign is found when the background velocity is increasing with altitude ) .",
    "the fractional powers and logarithms involved in ( [ vertial_str0 ] ) are multivalued functions for which suitable branches need to be selected .",
    "this selection is dictated by causality and is most easily settled by adding small damping terms in ( [ wavepri ] ) .",
    "the upshot is that the multivalued functions should be continued from @xmath83 to @xmath84 along a contour in the complex plane that passes _ below _ the singularities at @xmath85 @xcite . in this way , @xmath86 between the inertial levels so that the solution is decreasing exponentially with @xmath60 there , like @xmath87 .",
    "overall , the solution experiences an absorption by the factor @xmath88 ( see also @xcite ) known to apply to both the rotating and non - rotating cases .",
    "note that the reliance on causality means that the problem is not treated as strictly inviscid but rather as a vanishing viscosity limit .",
    "the wkb approximation ( [ vertial_str0 ] ) breaks down near the inertial levels , specifically for @xmath89 where it should be replaced by an expression in terms of hankel functions @xcite .",
    "these regions are narrow enough and the singularities of ( [ vertial_str0 ] ) at @xmath85 are mild enough that they can be ignored when computing the vertical velocity of the complete wavepacket .    substituting the form ( [ mountain ] ) of the topography into the boundary condition ( [ w_bc ] ) , we obtain the vertical velocity at the boundary as the fourier expansion @xmath90 here and henceforth , a real part is implied . combining this with ( [ hatwdef ] ) and ( [ vertial_str0 ] ) leads to the vertical velocity of the wavepacket in the form @xmath91 note that , because @xmath76 is exponentially small for @xmath92 as a result of wave absorption , the lower limit of the integral in @xmath69 could be taken as @xmath93 .",
    "this absorption is crucial for the impact of the wavepacket on the mean flow .",
    "the solution ( [ wori0 ] ) can be further simplified by taking advantage of the assumptions @xmath94 and @xmath95 to apply a saddle - point approximation .",
    "the key is to identify the dominant terms in the argument of the exponential , including a contribution from @xmath76 . to avoid defining several new dimensionless numbers measuring the relative size of @xmath43 , @xmath96 and @xmath39 , it is expedient to introduce a bookkeeping parameter @xmath97 which keeps track of the orders of various terms .",
    "this parameter is treated as formally small and used as a basis for a saddle - point approximation , but it is set to @xmath98 at the end of the computation to obtain asymptotic formulas in a convenient dimensional form .",
    "the bookkeeping parameter @xmath97 is introduced through the replacements @xmath99 in accordance with the scalings ( [ smallrossby ] ) , ( [ jscale ] ) and ( [ kdscale ] ) .",
    "thus the formal smallness of @xmath97 captures at once the mountain scale separation , the large richardson number , and the small rossby number .",
    "we emphasise that the bookkeeping device is completely equivalent to using , say , @xmath43 as a large parameter and treating @xmath100 and @xmath101 as order one ; it is employed here for the economy and transparency of notation it brings .    introducing ( [ eps ] ) into ( [ wori0 ] ) leads to @xmath102 where @xmath103 and makes the dependence on @xmath97 explicit . in writing this expression , we have made a first approximation by replacing the wavenumber @xmath69 outside the exponential functions by its leading - order approximation @xmath72 .",
    "the error introduced is negligible as can be verified below once the size of the neighbourhood of @xmath72 controlling the integral is estimated .",
    "a second approximation is made in carrying out the integration with respect to @xmath104 in ( [ wori ] ) . because the integral is dominated by values of @xmath104 near @xmath105 ,",
    "we write @xmath106 where @xmath107 , leading to the following expressions @xmath108 where @xmath109 is treated as @xmath110 since @xmath69 is close to @xmath111 . substituting these into ( [ wori ] ) and neglecting @xmath112",
    ", we obtain @xmath113 in the second line , we have ignored a phase factor and introduced the symbol @xmath114 to denote an equality in modulus only , ignoring phase factors . in what follows , we pay only attention to the modulus of @xmath63 since this controls the wave ",
    "mean flow interaction properties : the spatially averaged ep flux , which is quadratic in wave quantities , only depends on the wave amplitude and on the relative phase of various fields which is easily worked out .",
    "the appearance of the bookkeeping parameter @xmath115 in the exponential in ( [ w ] ) motivates the saddle - point approximation . to apply this",
    ", we need to compare the leading terms in the exponential , namely @xmath116 the first term stems from the finite spectral width of the mountain height ; the second term , which depends on @xmath60 and hence @xmath61 , captures the vertical structure of the wave .",
    "we seek distinguished regimes , where the leading - order terms in ( [ expbal ] ) balance .",
    "this requires approximating @xmath117 to determine its order , a non - trivial task since the order of @xmath117 depends on the value of @xmath60 , that is , on the particular range of altitude considered .",
    "mathematically , different altitude ranges are captured by different values of @xmath118 in the scaling @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "note that , since @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath61 have different signs , with @xmath123 below the dominant inertial level and increasing downwards . because @xmath60 depends on both @xmath61 and @xmath69",
    ", we also need to scale @xmath69 to find range of wavenumbers controlling the integral in ( [ w ] ) .",
    "since the wavepacket is concentrated around @xmath124 , we write @xmath125    combining ( [ z_exp ] ) and ( [ k_exp ] ) , we obtain @xmath126 we now need to distinguish two situations : ( i ) for @xmath127 , that is , away from the dominant inertial level , @xmath128 ( ii ) for @xmath129 , that is , asymptotically close to the dominant inertial level , @xmath130 because the leading - order terms in these two expansions are independent of @xmath69 , hence do not contribute to the integration over @xmath69 in ( [ w ] ) , the order of the second terms is crucial .",
    "using the scalings of the second terms of ( [ d_exp2])([d_exp ] ) in the second expression in ( [ expbal ] ) , and balancing with the first expression ( scaling like @xmath131 ) leads to two distinguished regimes : regime i , with @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and regime ii , with @xmath134 ( since @xmath135 gives a distinguished regime ) . in each regime , the coordinate @xmath47 appearing in @xmath136 should be scaled so that the @xmath137-dependent contribution to @xmath138 , proportional to @xmath139 , be of the same order as the @xmath137-dependent terms in ( [ expbal ] ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath140 in regime i and @xmath141 in regime ii .",
    "we carry out the saddle - point expansion of ( [ w ] ) in these two regimes in appendix [ appendix1 ] and only quote the final results here . in regime i , after setting @xmath142 , we find that @xmath143 where @xmath144 @xmath145 , @xmath146 and we have used that @xmath147 .",
    "this makes clear that the wavepacket retains the bell shape of topography , with scale @xmath2 , throughout its propagation across regime i. the path of the wavepacket in the @xmath148-plane is determined by setting @xmath149 in ( [ approx_i ] ) , which corresponds to standard ray tracing .",
    "it shows in particular that the wavepacket diverges to infinity as it approaches the dominant inertial level , with @xmath150 as @xmath151 .",
    "this is a limitation of the approximation made in regime i ( also a limitation of ray tracing ) rather than a physical effect as the analysis of regime ii shows . in regime",
    "ii , and again with @xmath142 , we find that @xmath152 where the @xmath153-dependence is controlled by the gaussian @xmath154 with @xmath155 , and is decoupled from the dependence in @xmath47 and @xmath61 . in ( [ apprii ] ) , the function @xmath156 is defined by @xmath157 and @xmath158 is one of its saddle points , satisfying @xmath159 , where the prime denotes derivative .",

    "the behavior for small @xmath167 is key for the mean - flow forcing . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec_wave_pre ] , the change in ep flux is concentrated in the inertial layer , such that @xmath168 with @xmath169 given in ( [ ilscale ] ) .",

    "the integral in ( [ w ] ) is dominated by wavenumbers @xmath69 in an @xmath110 neighbourhood of the central wavenumber @xmath124 , corresponding to @xmath133 in ( [ k_exp ] ) .",
    "the associated regime , which we term regime ii@xmath173 , is a limit of regime ii , obtained when some terms are negligible ( notably the first term in the phase function ( [ phasep ] ) ) .",
    "this makes it possible to derive an expression for @xmath63 simpler than ( [ apprii])which we will subsequently use to compute the mean - flow forcing .",
    "this expression is derived in appendix [ regimeiib ] and given by @xmath174 where @xmath175 and @xmath176 according to this , the wavepacket is centred on the curve @xmath177 in the @xmath178-plane ( obtained by maximising ( [ wb ] ) ) and localized in a region of order - one size in both the @xmath179 and @xmath122 direction . in view of ( [ z ] ) and ( [ xrescale_iib ] ) , this corresponds to a region of streamwise extent @xmath180 , thus much larger than the size @xmath2 of the mountain , located an @xmath180 distance downstream of the topography , and of @xmath181 vertical extent .",
    "thus , the prediction of ray tracing of a wavepacket that diverges to infinity as the dominant inertial level is approached is replaced in regime ii@xmath173 ( and hence in regime ii ) by a large - but - finite horizontal shift . note that in the limit of @xmath182 , the wavepacket propagates vertically with a vertical velocity that tends to zero as it approaches the critical level @xmath9 towards which the inertial levels coalesce , with @xmath183 as @xmath184 .",

    "<S> we solve a quasi - geostrophic potential - vorticity equation forced by the divergence of the eliassen  palm flux to compute the wave - induced mean flow . </S>",
    "<S> our results , obtained in an inviscid limit , show that the wavepacket reaches a large - but - finite distance downstream of the mountain ( specifically , a distance of order @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 measure the wave and envelope scales of the mountain ) and extends horizontally over a similar scale . </S>"
