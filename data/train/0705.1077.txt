    "the gas at galactic plane is driven toward central smbh , triggering the activity of active galaxy @xcite and black hole accretion .",
    "smbhs in galactic nuclei likely increase mainly through matter accretion . in this scenario ,",

    "lose their orbital angular momentum owing to galactic dynamic friction and form a bound supermassive black hole binary ( smbhb ) at a separation of @xmath13 , when the smbhb bind energy becomes dominated .",
    "the dynamics friction is very efficient because of the traps of stellar objects around each black hole and the evolution timescale of smbhb is order of the local dynamic timescale , depending on the stellar velocity of two galaxies .",
    "the evolution of a bound smbhb is dominated by the dynamic friction but the evolution timescale depends on the inner surface brightness profiles of galaxies .",
    "a smbhb becomes hard at a separation @xmath14 , when the loss of the orbital angular momentum is dominated by three - body interactions between smbhb and the stars passing by @xcite .",
    "when smbhb becomes hard but orbital angular momentum loss because of gravitational wave radiation is unimportant , smbhb may stall at @xmath15 on a timescale longer than the hubble time .",
    "however , observations of nearby galaxies suggest that most smbhbs should have passed through the hard phase and become coalesced quickly .",
    "this is the so - called _ final parsec problem _ @xcite . to solve the problem , theoretically several processes with large uncertainties",
    "have been suggested in the literature @xcite and the hydrodynamics interaction with gas disk may play the major role @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether we could detect smbhb at galactic center , determine its evolution , and give observational constraints on the formation and evolution of smbhb .",
    "although unbound agn binary systems with separation of order kpc or larger have been imaged in interacting and merging galaxies ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no hard or bound smbhb has been directly detected .",
    "close smbhbs or binary coalescence have been introduced in explaining the observations of many agns , for example , periodic optical and radio outbursts @xcite , periodic variation of very long baseline interferometer ( vlbi ) jet position angle @xcite , the interruption of jet formation in double - double radio galaxies ( ddrgs ) @xcite , x - shaped radio feature in winged radio sources @xcite , and s- or z - shaped morphological symmetry of radio jets ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bbr ) . a recent review on the observational evidences for smbhb was given by @xcite .",
    "the periodic outbursts may be due to the periodic interaction of a smbhb and a standard accretion disk or an adaf , while the periodic variation of vlbi jet position angle is because of binary orbital motion .",
    "however , when the disk mass inside the binary orbit is less than the mass of the secondary which is at a radius order of @xmath16 times the schwarzschild radius of the primary black hole , the interaction between the accretion disk and the smbhb will realign the inner accretion disk and the binary orbital plane @xcite .",
    "when a smbhb becomes coalecing due to gravitational wave radiation , the interaction between the secondary black hole and the aligned accretion disk would remove the inner disk region and leave a truncated outer accretion disk , leading to the interruption of jet formation in ddrgs @xcite and to the formation of delayed x - ray afterglow of a gravitational wave radiation burst @xcite .",
    "the s- or z - shaped radio morphological symmetry has been observed for a high fraction of agns and was suggested as an observational evidence of smbhb by @xcite .",
    "it is explained with jet precession of periods about between @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because of geodetic precession of the spin axis of the primary rotating smbh misaligned with binary total angular momentum @xcite , the orbital motion of jet ejecting black hole , the disk precession tidally perturbed by the secondary black hole @xcite , or the precession of a inner warped disk owing to bardeen - peterson ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in all the models reviewed above , it has implicitly assumed that the precession of jet orientation follows the precession of the spin axis of the emitting rotating black hole and the rotating axis of the inner region of accretion disk around the black hole .",
    "although there are many models for the jet formations , it is usually believed that jets form in the inner disk region along the spin axis of black hole or the rotating axis of the inner region of accretion disk , depending on the driving energy resources . because the small characteristic size of jet production region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the alignment of rotating black hole and the inner region of accretion disk due to bardeen - peterson effect @xcite , it seems reasonable to assume that jet would always orient along the rotating axis of both the black hole and the inner regions of accretion disk irrespective of the driving mechanisms .",
    "thus , in this paper we will take the same assumption that jets would , if present , precess with the rotating axis of the emitting central black hole and the accretion disk . with the assumption",
    ", all the models in the literature can explain the observed jet precession , though the results depends on many parameters with very large uncertainties .",
    "one of the very important question is how to tell which model is the right one and to determine parameters . with the improvement of observational instrument",
    ", jet precession can be observed up to many cycles , which make it possible to measure the precession timescale with very high accuracy . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possibility to measure the time derivative of jet precession timescale . in the precession models ,",
    "a rigid - body like disk precession is assumed in the literature .",
    "here we take the same assumption .",
    "a circumbinary accretion disk could be warped by a massive smbhb with random orbital inclination angle relative to accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the interaction quickly realigns the inner warped disk region and finally the central rotating smbh with the binary orbital plane , while the outer unperturbed disk region far from the binary orbit remains coplanar with the galactic plane .",
    "this scenario predicates the formations of x - shaped radio feature in frii radio galaxies and a random distribution of jet orientation with respect to the galactic plane @xcite . a warped disk precesses , leading to jet precession .",
    "therefore , before discussing the variations of jet precession timescale , we calculate the precession of a warped circumbinary non - massive disk in this paper .",
    "although the detailed smbhb models for jet precession are different , all of them predicates a increase of precession timescale with binary evolution .",
    "as smbhbs in galactic nuclei never get softer @xcite , the secondary black hole always migrates toward the binary mass center and the jet precession is expected to be accelerated in the smbhb models . after calculating the jet precession timescale and smbhb evolution timescale in different models , we show that the acceleration of jet precession could reach 20 % or even higher depending on the parameters of smbhb systems and accretion disks",
    ". differential measurement of jet precession can be used to distinguish the different precession models and determine the evolution timescale of smbhb in galactic nuclei . with the measurement of precession acceleration",
    ", we could also determine the kinematic viscosity coefficient of accretion disk and the binary parameters .",
    "following the different physical mechanisms driving the evolution of smbhb in galactic nuclei , in section  [ sec : dynfr ] we start our calculations of the hardening rate of smbhb and the acceleration of jet precession with the regime when stellar dynamic friction affects the merger . in section",
    "[ sec : massdisk ] , we calculate the evolution of smbhb and the time variation of jet precession because of the interaction of smbhb with a massive circumbinary accretion disk , which is followed by the calculations for the scenario in which the evolution of smbhb is dominated by the interaction between smbhb and a non - massive circumbinary accretion disk in section  [ sec : nmassdisk ] . in section  [ sec : gw ] , we estimate the acceleration of jet precession because of the rapid evolution of smbhb dominated by gravitational wave radiations . as an example , in section  [ sec : ngc ] we discuss the differential observations of jet precession in a recent merged system , ngc1275 ( 3c84 ) , and the implications to the smbhb in the object .",

    "the alternative for jet precession independent of source activity and the accretion is the binary geodetic precession . from equation  ( [ eq : precbbr ] ) , to obtain the averaged precession timescale from the ancient to the outer lobes , we have the binary separation @xmath257 . because @xmath258 , the binary is hard and the secondary may migrate inward when it interacts with a light standard disk , leading to the acceleration of jet precession @xmath259 where we have used accretion rate @xmath260 and equation  ( [ eq : geocmbl ] ) .",

    "therefore , the scenario of geodetic precession for jet precession is less favorable .",
    "smbhbs are expected by the hierarchical galaxy formation model and may have been observed in many agns .",
    "jet precession observed in many agns is one of the observational evidences . in this paper , we start our work with the discussion of different mechanisms for the jet precession , including ( 1 ) the geodetic precession of spin axis of central primary smbh around total angular momentum , ( 2 ) the orbital motion of the smbh ejecting plasma jets , ( 3 ) the inner disk precession because of the tidal interaction of an inclined secondary black hole , ( 4 ) the precession of a circumbinary disk warped by the smbhb , and ( 5 ) the disk precession because of bardeen - peterson effect .",
    "the precession of a circumbinary disk warped by a smbhb is discussed first time .",
    "we did not discuss the precession model due to disc instability @xcite , because it suggests a stochastic precession rather than a regular precession and is inconsistent with the observations of jet precession in most agns .",
    "although bardeen - peterson effect does not directly connect to the presence of smbhb , the origin of misalignment between the rotating central black hole and the accretion disk may be due to the interaction of accretion disk and an inclined smbhb .",
    "when the inner disk region becomes misaligned with the binary orbital plane owing to the bardeen - peterson effect , the tidal interaction of the secondary to the warped inner disk also leads to jet precession .    in these scenarios for jet precession ,",
    "the precession timescale ranges from order of years to much longer than @xmath266 , depending on the parameters of smbhb and accretion disk .",
    "however , the parameters are very difficult to determine and the observations of jet precession timescale can not give restrict constraints on the models and the parameters , as they are degenerate .",
    "therefore , we suggested to observe one more quantity , the time variations of jet precession timescale , to resolve the parameters .",
    "we calculated the time variation of jet precession in different models and showed that jet precession is always accelerated in an evolving smbhb system .",
    "the acceleration of jet precession is related to the evolution timescale of smbhb with @xmath267 , resulting from the fact that all smbhb models for jet precession predicate a relation @xmath268 with @xmath269 and that a smbhb in galactic nuclei never gets softer .",
    "the parameter @xmath270 slightly depends on model with @xmath202 .",
    "our investigations also show that jet precession because of bardeen - peterson effect is decelerated with agn evolution .",
    "our results suggest that the sign of the time derivative of precession timescale can be used to identify smbhb models from the others .",
    "our calculations show that the time variation of jet precession is proportional to the timescale ratio of jet precession and smbhb evolution .",
    "we analytically estimated the evolution timescale of smbhbs at different evolution stage and the time variation for jet precession in different models , based on our current knowledge of smbhbs .",
    "our calculations show that for an un - bound smbhb the mechanism for jet precession is the orbital motion and the quick binary evolution because of galactic dynamic friction leads to around 20 % or higher acceleration rate of jet precession timescale . for a bound smbhb system",
    ", jet precession could be due to geodetic precession of the rotating primary black hole , disk precession because of tidal interaction between a standard accretion disk and the secondary , and the binary orbital motion . at this stage ,",
    "the evolution timescale of smbhb depends on the inner surface brightness profiles of galaxies and is estimated with an asymptotic analytic relation of the binary hardening timescale and the separation given by @xcite .",
    "although the estimate is very rough , our results suggest that the evolution timescale of smbhb is several order of magnitude shorter than the geodetic precession timescale and longer than the binary orbital period .",
    "so , the geodetic precession is not significant and the time variation of orbital motion is difficult to measure . however , if the jet precession is due to the tidal interaction of the secondary black hole and an inner misaligned accretion disk , the acceleration rate of jet precession could be a order of 10 % or higher .    when a smbhb becomes hard and stalls , jet precession may be steady for a timescale longer than the hubble time . because the migration of the secondary smbh due to the interaction with an adaf is negligible @xcite , a nearly steady precession jet may be possible if a smbhb interacts with an adaf or the precession is due to bardeen - peterson effect .",
    "the fundamental difference between the two scenarios is that the accretion disk is a geometrically thin standard disk in the later but geometrically thick adaf in the former .",
    "the accretion mode depends on the relative accretion rate @xmath94 , which one could infer by estimating the bolometric luminosity and central black hole mass . however , it is most probable that a smbhb interacts with a standard disk either massive or light .",
    "we compute the time variation of jet precession because of smbhb - accretion disk interaction and show that in both cases the binary - disk interaction would lead to a significant acceleration of jet precession : the acceleration is significant for jet precession because of tidal interaction of the secondary and a massive disk but both of geodetic precession and warped circumbinary disk precession in the case of non - massive disk , depending on the parameters of the binary system and the accretion disk .",
    "when the evolution of a smbhb is dominated by the gravitational wave radiation , the binary separation is about hundreds of schwarzschild radius or less .",
    "if a jet ejects from the central black hole , it precesses because of the black hole geodetic precession , of the tidal interaction of binary and inner misaligned disk , of binary orbital motion , and of the precession of warped circumbinary disk .",
    "our calculations show that the precession of a warped circumbinary disk is strongly accelerated owing to the migration of the secondary black hole because of gravitational wave radiation .",
    "the acceleration of jet precession because of geodetic precession is also very significant for a smbhb with non - zero eccentricity .",
    "when we calculate the jet precession timescale and its time variation , we have assumed that disk precession is rigid - like and the jet precession is directly related to it . although almost all the disk precession models for jet precession in the literature adopted the same assumption and have successfully explained the jet precession in some agns and micro - quasars ( e.g. ss433 ) , this assumption need more discussions . whether the assumption of a rigid body like precession is valid or not depends on the warp transfer in the disk . as we have discussed in section  [ sec : nmassdisk ] , the transportation of warps in disk depends on the vertical shear viscosity and the transfer timescale at the transition radius between the warped and unperturbed disk regions is on the same order of the precession timescale both for the bardeen - peterson effect and the warped circumbinary light disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the rigid body like approximation for disk precession is correct on the zero order of magnitude . as the jet precession and its time derivative depend on disk characters in a similar way",
    ", the relationship of the ratio of the precession timescale and its variation rate , @xmath271 ( \\tau_{\\rm a } /a)$ ] , and the smbhb evolution timescale @xmath2 would be expected to be insensitive to how warps transfer in the disk .",
    "following our theoretical investigation on the acceleration of jet precession , we discussed the implications of the differential observations of jet precession in ngc1275 ( 3c84 ) , a recent - merger radio galaxy .",
    "the differential jet precession have been measured between four different components in order of formation : ancient bubbles , ghost bubbles , outer lobes , and the active jets . between the formation of different components ,",
    "the activity of the object becomes very weak or the source is dormant .",
    "the precession timescale are significantly decreased with time among the different components .",
    "@xcite assumed a steady jet precession and the acceleration of jet precession just because of the missing of several cycles between adjacent components .",
    "however , even under this assumption the acceleration of jet precession from the ghost bubbles to the active jets is still significant . because the precession is steady",
    "when the source activity changes dramatically , the mechanism for the precession is independent of the accretion and thus most likely of the geodetic precession or orbital motion of smbhb . under the assumption of steady jet precession",
    ", we discussed the two possible mechanisms .",
    "our discussions suggest that if the precession is due to the binary orbital motion , the smbhb should have a too small mass ratio ( @xmath272 ) and the acceleration of jet precession from the ghost bubbles through outer lobes to the active jets can not be explained reasonably .",
    "our results show that the steady precession from the ancient bubbles to the outer lobes is probably due to the geodetic precession and the jet precession from the outer lobes to active jets may be due to the precession of a warped circumbinary light standard thin disk . in this scenario ,",
    "smbhb formed in a major merger with mass ratio @xmath273 and the binary has a separation @xmath274 .",
    "the predicated acceleration of jet precession is about a few to ten percent and may have not yet been observed because of the low observational accuracy .",
    "like what our theoretical investigations show that there is no _ a priori _ requirement for a steady jet precession , we discussed the implications that if a continuous rapid acceleration of precession from the ancient bubbles to the active jets has indeed been observed .",
    "our results show that in this case the mechanism for jet precession is the orbital motion and that the rapid acceleration of jet precession is due to the rapid evolution of smbhb because of galactic dynamic friction .",
    "the calculations give a galactic dynamic friction evolution timescale @xmath275 and an averaged dynamic friction velocity @xmath276 .",
    "the smbhb forms in the major galaxy merger with an averaged black hole mass ratio @xmath277 and has a separation @xmath278 .",
    "as our conclusions , we discussed the scenarios for jet precession in agns and calculated the time derivatives of the precession timescale .",
    "our calculations show that jet precession is accelerated in smbhb models but nearly steady in the bardeen - peterson effect scenario .",
    "we analytically computed the predicated acceleration of jet precession in the evolution of a smbhb from unbound to gravitational - wave - dominated stages and showed that the time variation is significant and can be detected easily .",
    "one can estimate the evolution timescale and mass ratio of smbhb , and the parameters of accretion disk in agns by measuring the central black hole mass , the accretion rate , the jet precession timescale , and its time derivative .",
    "if we have observations of jet precession acceleration of a sample of radio sources , we can test the hierarchical galaxy formation model and the galactic dynamics .",

    "<S> supermassive black hole binary ( smbhb ) is expected with the hierarchical galaxy formation model . currently , physics processes dominating the evolution of a smbhb are unclear . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting question is whether we could observationally determine the evolution of smbhb and give constraints on the physical processes . </S>",
    "<S> jet precession have been observed in many agns and generally attributed to disk precession . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the time variation of jet precession and conclude that jet precession is accelerated in smbhb systems but decelerated in others . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration of jet precession @xmath0 is related to jet precession timescale @xmath1 and smbhb evolution timescale @xmath2 , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations based on the models for jet precession and smbhb evolution show that @xmath0 can be as high as about @xmath4 with a typical value @xmath5 and can be easily detected . </S>",
    "<S> we discussed the differential jet precession for ngc1275 observed in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> if the observed rapid acceleration of jet precession is true , the jet precession is due to the orbital motion of an unbound smbhb with mass ratio @xmath6 . when jets precessed from the ancient bubbles to the currently active jets , the separation of smbhb decrease from about @xmath7 to @xmath8 with an averaged decreasing velocity @xmath9 and evolution timescale @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we assume a steady jet precession for many cycles , the observations implies a hard smbhb with mass ratio @xmath11 and separation @xmath12 . </S>"
