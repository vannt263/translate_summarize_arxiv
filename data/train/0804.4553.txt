    ", there is an interesting and important model in which extra dimensions comprise a compact hyperbolic manifold @xcite .",
    "the model is known to be free of usual problems that plague the original arkani - hamed - dimopoulos - dvali ( add ) models and share many common features with randall - sundrum ( rs ) models .    in the brane world scenario , an important question is localization of various bulk fields on a brane by a natural mechanism .",
    "it is well known that massless scalar fields @xcite and graviton @xcite can be localized on branes of different types , and that spin 1 abelian vector fields can not be localized on the rs brane in five dimensions , but can be localized in some higher - dimensional cases @xcite .",
    "spin 1/2 fermions do not have normalizable zero modes and hence can not be localized in five and six dimensions @xcite .",
    "recently , an increasing interest has been focused on the study of thick brane scenarios based on gravity coupled to scalars in higher dimensional space - time @xcite .",
    "a virtue of these models is that the branes can be obtained naturally rather than introduced by hand @xcite .",
    "besides , these scalar fields provide the  material \" of which the thick branes are made . in ref .",
    "@xcite , exact solutions of the einstein  scalar equations with a sine - gordon potential and a negative cosmological constant were constructed . in this system",
    "the scalar field configuration in fact is a kink , which provides a thick brane realization of the brane world as a domain wall in the bulk .",
    "the warped background space - time has a non  constant but asymptotically negative ricci curvature .",
    "such a configuration was also illustrated in several examples in the literature @xcite .",

    "localization of fermions in general space - times had been studied for example in @xcite . in five dimensions , with the scalar ",
    "fermion coupling , there may exist a single bound state and a continuous gapless spectrum of massive fermion kk states @xcite , while for some other brane models , there exist finite discrete kk states ( mass gap ) and a continuous gapless spectrum starting at a positive @xmath6 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that fermions can escape into the bulk by tunnelling , and the rate depends on the parameters of the scalar potential . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors obtained trapped discrete massive fermion states on the brane , which in fact are quasi - bound and have a finite probability of escaping into the bulk .",
    "it is also interesting to note that in ref .",
    "@xcite fermion modes in a sine - gordon kink and kink - anti - kink system were also studied in some 1 + 1 dimensional scalar field theories .",
    "it was shown that there exist discrete bound states . however ,",
    "when the wall and anti - wall approach each other , the system can not support fermion bound states and the discrete states merge into the continuous spectrum of the dirac equation .",
    "it is known that , under the yukawa coupling @xmath1 , only one of the effective potentials of the left and right chiral fermions could trap the corresponding zero mode for positive @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in this paper , we will reinvestigate the localization issues of fermions on the branes obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in the presence of different types of scalar - fermion couplings , by presenting the mass - independent potentials in the corresponding schrdinger equations .",
    "we will show that , for the coupling @xmath2 , not only the potential of the left chiral fermions but also the potential of the right ones could trap the corresponding zero modes for positive @xmath5 and @xmath4 under certain different restrictions for each case .",
    "besides , instead of discrete massive kk mode , there exists a continuous gapless spectrum of kk states with @xmath3 .",
    "the shapes of the potentials also suggest that the massive kk modes asymptotically turn into plane waves , which represent delocalized massive kk fermions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ secmodel ] , we first give a brief review of the thick brane arising from a sine - gordon potential in a 5-dimensional space - time .",
    "then , in section [ seclocalize ] , we study localization of spin half fermions on the thick brane with two different types of scalar - fermion interactions by presenting the shapes of the potentials of the corresponding schrdinger problem .",

    ", the bulk sine - gordon potential provides a thick brane realization of the randall  sundrum scenario , and the soliton configuration of the scalar field dynamically generate the domain wall configuration with warped geometry .",
    "the action for such a system is given by @xmath9 , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 with @xmath11 the 5-dimensional newton constant , and @xmath12 is the 5-dimensional cosmological constant .",

    "the scalar field is considered to be a function of @xmath16 only .",
    "the field equations , that are derivable from ( [ action ] ) with the ansatz ( [ linee ] ) , reduce to the following coupled nonlinear differential equations @xmath17 for the sine - gordon potential ( [ vphi ] ) , the solution can be calculated @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are given by @xmath21 the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath12 are free to choose , and @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 observing the forms of ( [ ay ] ) and ( [ sgkink ] ) , one can find that the configuration of @xmath24 is a kink for positive @xmath4 , and the warp factor @xmath25 is a smooth function .",

    "<S> a class of thick branes in the background of sine - gordon kinks with a scalar potential @xmath0 was constructed by r. koley and s. kar [ classical quantum gravity * 22 * , 753 ( 2005 ) ] . in this paper , in the background of the warped geometry , we investigate the issue of localization of spin half fermions on these branes in the presence of two types of scalar - fermion couplings : @xmath1 and @xmath2 . by presenting the mass - independent potentials in the corresponding schrdinger equations , we obtain the lowest kaluza  klein ( kk ) modes and a continuous gapless spectrum of kk states with @xmath3 for both types of couplings . for the yukawa coupling @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the effective potential of the right chiral fermions for positive @xmath4 and @xmath5 is always positive , hence only the effective potential of the left chiral fermions could trap the corresponding zero mode . </S>",
    "<S> this is a well - known conclusion which had been discussed extensively in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the coupling @xmath2 , the effective potential of the right chiral fermions for positive @xmath4 and @xmath5 is no longer always positive . </S>",
    "<S> although the value of the potential at the location of the brane is still positive , it has a series of wells and barriers on each side , which ensures that the right chiral fermion zero mode could be trapped . </S>",
    "<S> thus we may draw the remarkable conclusion : for positive @xmath5 and @xmath4 , the potentials of both the left and right chiral fermions could trap the corresponding zero modes under certain restrictions . </S>"
