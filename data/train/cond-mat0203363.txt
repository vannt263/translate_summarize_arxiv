    "three recent experiments @xcite have shed new light on the spin and charge density wave collective modes of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "this article will summarize the main results of our theory @xcite of these collective modes in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition between two superconducting states , only one of which has static , long - range , spin density wave order : we will recall our main predictions , and discuss further experimental tests .",
    "we will also connect our theory to these experiments .",
    "in particular , we suggested @xcite that static charge order should coexist with dynamic spin - gap fluctuations around the vortex cores in the cuprate superconductors , as may have been been observed in @xcite .",
    "we also discussed @xcite a singular field dependence for the static magnetic moment in the underdoped cuprates , and this is consistent with @xcite .",
    "the starting hypothesis of our theory is that the collective spin excitations of the doped cuprates can be described by using the proximity of a magnetic quantum critical point .",
    "this was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; almost simultaneously , nmr experiments in la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 @xcite showed crossovers which could be neatly interpreted in terms of a magnetic quantum critical point near a doping concentration @xmath6 with dynamic exponent @xmath7 .",
    "the ground state is a good superconductor at this value of @xmath8 , and so the magnetic transition takes place between two superconducting states .",
    "evidence supporting this interpretation also appeared in neutron scattering measurements @xcite .",
    "an explicit theory for a quantum transition between a @xmath9-wave superconductor with co - existing long - range spin density wave order ( a sc+sdw state ) and an ordinary @xmath9-wave superconductor ( a sc state ) was first discussed by balents _",
    "_ @xcite ; they focused on the case where the sdw ordering wavevector was exactly equal to the spacing between the two nodal points where the @xmath9-wave superconductor has gapless quasi - particle excitations , and studied their role in the critical theory .",
    "however , their analysis also makes it clear that the nodal quasiparticles can be safely neglected for the generic case in which the wavevector matching condition is not satisfied @xcite , and we will mainly discuss this simpler case here .",
    "the sc+sdw to sc transition in this case is formally identical to that in an insulator , and the sc state has a sharp @xmath10 ` resonance peak ' associated with stable @xmath10 collective excitonic excitation @xcite .",
    "such a theory for the sc to sc+sdw transition was used by us @xcite to predict the effects of zn impurities on the resonance peak in the sc phase .",
    "neutron scattering experiments show that the lowest energy collective spin excitations at and above @xmath6 reside near the wavevectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( our unit of length is the square lattice spacing ) .",
    "so we write for the spin operator at the site @xmath13 : @xmath14 , \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 extends over the directions in spin space , and @xmath16 are _ complex _ fields which will serve as order parameters for the sc+sdw to sc transition . in the sc+sdw phase ,",
    "@xmath16 are condensed and the condensate describes the spatial modulation of the spin , by ( [ e1 ] ) ; in the sc phase , the @xmath16 are dynamically fluctuating , and its quanta are _",
    "spin excitons_. the representation ( [ e1 ] ) can describe a large variety of spin modulations _",
    "e.g. _ the state with @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a spiral sdw in the @xmath19 direction .",
    "experimentally , however , it is clear that the sdw is not spiral , but _ collinear _ ; an example of a collinear sdw has @xmath20 , @xmath18notice that the average spin vectors on all sites are parallel or antiparallel .",
    "the phase @xmath21 represents a _ sliding _ degree of freedom of the sdw : for the special commensurate value of @xmath22 under consideration here , the coupling to the lattice will prefer that @xmath21 take one of the values @xmath23 ( a site - centered sdw ) or @xmath24 ( a bond - centered sdw ) where @xmath25 integer .",
    "a sketch of a bond - centered sdw is shown in fig  [ sdw ] .    .",
    "the size of the arrow represents the mean spin moment , while the shading of the circle is the electron density .",
    "the sliding degree of freedom corresponds to a shift in the position of the light and dark circles.,width=384 ]    notice that the magnitude of the spin changes from site to site , and this implies @xcite that there must be a corresponding modulation in the electron density , @xmath26 : the latter has the same quantum numbers as @xmath27 , and hence we deduce that the charge order can be written as @xmath28 + \\ldots . \\label{e2}\\ ] ] the period of the charge order is half that of the sdw , and the amplitude of the charge order vanishes for the spiral sdw .",
    "we emphasize that after accounting for the long - range coulomb interactions , the actual modulation in the electron charge density per site may well be unobservably small .",
    "the `` charge order '' discussed here and in ( [ e2 ] ) should be interpreted in a much more general sense , as representing a modulation at wavevectors @xmath29 in all spin - singlet observables which are invariant under time - reversal ; the modulation could be larger in other observables like the mean kinetic energy , exchange energy , or pairing amplitude in the bonds between nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "we are interested here in the quantum transition from the sc+sdw state with @xmath30 to the sc state with @xmath31 in a background of quiescent superconductivity .",
    "the allowed terms in the effective action are constrained by the underlying symmetries : these were discussed in some generality in @xcite . here",
    "we will be satisfied by considering a simplified effective action which is written most easily in terms of the real and imaginary components of @xmath16 : @xmath32 the effective action for the real fields @xmath33 , @xmath34 is taken to be @xmath35 + \\frac{u}{2 } ( \\varphi_{\\mu}^2)^2 \\bigr\\ } \\label{e3}\\ ] ] where a summation over the repeated @xmath36 index is implied , and we have chosen units so that the velocity of spin waves is unity . notice that the action @xmath37 has a large o(12 ) symmetry of rotations in @xmath36 space .",
    "this symmetry is present in _ all _ allowed terms which are quadratic in @xmath33 , but is broken by a number of quartic terms @xcite which are not displayed in ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "however , all permitted terms in the effective action do respect the sliding symmetry under which @xmath38 for integer @xmath39 .",
    "the coupling @xmath40 serves as the tuning parameter which measures distance from the quantum critical point : the sc+sdw phase will appear for @xmath41 and the spin - singlet sc phase for @xmath42 .",
    "the dynamic properties of the transition at @xmath43 have been investigated in much detail in earlier work @xcite .",
    "now we consider the influence of the magnetic field , @xmath44 , applied perpendicular to the cuo@xmath0 layers .",
    "this couples most strongly to the ` background ' sc order , and so we are forced to consider the response of the superconducting order parameter @xmath45 . in suitable units ( discussed in @xcite )",
    ", the free energy for @xmath45 can be written in the familiar ginzburg - landau form @xmath46 \\label{f}.\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is a parameter measuring the relative contributions of the magnetic and superconducting energies , and @xmath48 .",
    "notice that we have assumed a @xmath49 independent @xmath50this is permissible because the sc order is non - critical and its quantum fluctuations can be safely neglected .",
    "we have now defined a well - posed field theoretical problem , which was analyzed in some detail in @xcite : describe the dynamic quantum sdw fluctuations associated with the partition function @xmath58 = \\int { \\cal d } \\varphi_{\\mu } ( { \\bf r } , \\tau ) \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{{\\cal f}}{t } - { \\cal s}_{\\varphi } - { \\cal s}_{v } - { \\cal s}_{\\rm pin } \\right ) , \\label{zdef}\\ ] ] where the optimum value of the static sc order @xmath45 is determined by the minimization of @xmath59 $ ] via the solution of the saddle - point equation @xmath60}{\\delta \\psi ( { \\bf r } ) } = 0 .",
    "\\label{scdef}\\ ] ] note the highly asymmetric treatment of the sc and sdw orders .",
    "our primary results for the properties of ( [ zdef ] ) and ( [ scdef ] ) are contained in the phase diagram as a function of @xmath40 and @xmath44 in fig  [ figpd ] .     defined in ( [ zdef ] ) and ( [ scdef ] ) ; from refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the phases have the following expectation values : ( _ i _ ) sc : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , ( _ ii _ ) sc+sdw : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , ( _ iii _ ) sdw : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and ( _ iv _ ) `` normal '' : @xmath67 , @xmath68.,width=336 ]    the formal solution of these equations also allows solutions in which the sc order vanishes and @xmath69 everywhere : this leads to the sdw phase and the `` normal '' phase .",
    "however we do not expect our theory to be accurate such a regime : quantum fluctuations of the sc order parameter are surely important once @xmath45 becomes small , and these have been neglected in our theory .",
    "our results are more precise in the small @xmath44 region of fig  [ figpd ] , in the vicinity of the boundary between the sc+sdw and sc phases ; indeed , the functional forms of the main results quoted below are expected to be exact . upon accounting for the quantum fluctuations of the superconducting order , and the berry phases associated with the electrons in the nearby mott insulator @xcite",
    ", we expect that the `` normal '' phase will display some sort of static charge order .",
    "an important prediction of our theory is the shape of the second - order phase boundary between the sc and sc+sdw phases at small @xmath44 .",
    "this transition is associated with the condensation of the @xmath33 exciton , when the spin gap to the creation of an exciton vanishes in the sc phase .",
    "detailed arguments were presented in @xcite showing that this condensation occurs in an exciton state which is extended throughout the entire lattice ; indeed , a variational approximation in which the exciton wavefunction is assumed to be simply a constant gives essentially exact results ( as opposed to an approximation in which the exciton is strongly localized in the vortex cores @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of the vortex lattice in @xmath45 influences the energy of this extended exciton primarily via the @xmath51 coupling in @xmath70 .",
    "when spatially averaged over @xmath13 , the dominant change in the average value of @xmath71 , and hence in the energy of the exciton , arises from slight suppression of superconductivity in the _ superflow _ region surrounding each vortex core .",
    "the much smaller vortex core region always has a significantly weaker effect on the exciton energy .",
    "it is a simple matter to compute the correction to the exciton energy from the superflow .",
    "the average kinetic energy of the superflow is known from standard ginzburg - landau theory to be @xmath72 ( here @xmath73 is the upper critical field at which superconductivity disappears ) , and the coupling @xmath51 in ( [ v ] ) therefore leads to a corresponding change in the effective value of @xmath40 controlling the exciton energy : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a positive constant .",
    "the critical field at which the spin gap vanishes is therefore determined by @xmath76 , and this leads to our result @xcite for the phase boundary between the sc and sc+sdw phases : @xmath77 note that the phase boundary approaches the @xmath78 limit with vanishing slope : consequently a relatively small field applied to the superconductor for @xmath42 will drive the system into the sc+sdw phase .",
    "this is our explanation for the shift in the energy of the dynamic spin fluctuations seen in @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of fig  [ figpd ] leads to a number of predictions @xcite for observables in the sc and sc+sdw phases , some of which have been tested in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "we discuss theory and experiment in the two phases in turn in the following subsections .",
    "the sc phase has @xmath67 , and so the sdw fluctuations are dynamic and the spin exciton only exists above a finite energy gap @xmath79 .",
    "the superconducting order @xmath45 is suppressed in the vortex cores , and so this region should exhibit characteristics of the doped spin - gap ( _ i.e. _ paramagnetic ) mott insulator , as was argued in @xcite .",
    "paramagnetic mott insulators , and their response to doping with mobile charge carriers , were studied at some length in @xcite : it was argued that the most likely candidates had bond - centered charge order which survived in a superconducting state for a finite range of doping ",
    "this work will be reviewed further in section  [ sec : p4 ] .",
    "reasoning in this manner , ref .",
    "@xcite predicted that static charge order should appear in and around the vortex cores , coexisting with dynamic spin fluctuations in the sc state .",
    "order of this type appears to have been seen in the recent stm experiment on bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "our approach should be contrasted from other recent investigations @xcite which have _ both _",
    "static spin and charge order in the vortex core .",
    "the spatial extent of the charge order was computed in the field theory in ( [ zdef ] ) , ( [ scdef ] ) in @xcite .",
    "the gapped spin exciton , @xmath33 , views the vortex lattice as a periodic potential , and consequently its dispersion develops the bloch structure of a particle moving in a periodic potential . to zeroth order in the pinning terms , @xmath57 ,",
    "the two - point @xmath80 green s function is diagonal in the @xmath36 index , and its diagonal component can be written as @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a bloch momentum which extends over the first brillouin zone of the vortex lattice , @xmath36 is a ` band ' index , @xmath83 are the bloch states ( @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an vector connecting two vortex centers ) , @xmath86 are the energy dispersions of the various bands , and @xmath87 is an imaginary matsubara frequency .",
    "the lowest energy exciton has energy @xmath88 and wavefunction @xmath89 ; this wavefunction is sketched for typical parameter values in fig  [ figexciton ] .    .",
    "the orientation of the spins fluctuates with a frequency of order the inverse spin gap @xmath90 .",
    "the open symbols represent the lowest energy exciton wavefunction @xmath89 .",
    "the nature of the microscopic spin correlations can be understood by recalling that this wavefunction is the envelope of the order fig  [ sdw ] .",
    "after including the pinning term @xmath91 , static charge order is induced , and its envelope @xmath92 ( defined in ( [ omega1],[omega2 ] ) ) is shown above .",
    "the numerical results were obtained by ying zhang and reported in @xcite.,width=336 ]    now let us consider the influence of the pinning term in ( [ spin ] ) . combining ( [ spin ] ) with ( [ e2 ] )",
    "it is simple to see that to first order in the @xmath57 , static charge order appears in the sc phase , with @xmath93 \\omega ( { \\bf r } ) \\label{omega1}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 a plot of the function @xmath92 is sketched in fig  [ figexciton ] , along with the corresponding @xmath95 . at the higher field ( triangles ) ,",
    "the spin exciton wavefunction @xmath96 is essentially constant across the entire system , with only a weak modulation induced by the vortex lattice ; nevertheless , at the same field the charge order @xmath92 has a strong modulation on the scale of @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a spin - wave velocity @xcite . at the lower field ( squares )",
    ", there is larger modulation in the spin exciton ( but @xmath89 only decays to half its maximum value ) , and again the decay length of the charge correlations is about half that of the spin correlations .",
    "the spatial form of the lower field @xmath92 in fig  [ figexciton ] is quite similar to envelope of the modulation observed in @xcite .",
    "the stm experiments of @xcite actually measure the modulation in the local electronic density of states ( ldos ) in a range of energies as a function position in vortex lattice .",
    "a great deal of information is , in principle , contained in the energy and spatial dependence of the ldos modulations .",
    "we have recently analyzed @xcite simple models for the coupling of the electronic quasiparticles to the collective sdw and sc degrees of freedom that have been discussed here : these lead to predictions for the ldos modulations , which can be usefully compared with the stm data  the reader is referred to the papers for details .",
    "we also mention here the recent stm experiments of howald _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which have observed charge order similar to that of @xcite but in zero applied magnetic field ; this order has ( presumably ) been pinned by impurities .",
    "the sc+sdw phase has @xmath63 , and hence via ( [ e1 ] ) , ( [ e2 ] ) , and ( [ ri ] ) , there is both static spin and charge order .",
    "neutron scattering measurements have so far only succeeded in observing the static spin order , and so we will restrict our discussion here to the spin moment .    in the presence of an applied magnetic field ,",
    "the vortex lattice will spatially modulate the value of @xmath99 , and this should , in principle , lead to satellite elastic peaks @xcite surrounding the main elastic bragg peaks at @xmath100 , @xmath101 observed in neutron scattering .",
    "however , our discussion above on the dominance of the superflow effect shows that this modulation occurs predominantly on the scale of the vortex lattice spacing @xcite , and not on the scale of the vortex core .",
    "the resulting satellite peaks are consequently found to be extremely weak , as will be clear from our results below .",
    "we show a sketch of the spatial form of @xmath102 at a point in the sc+sdw phase in fig  [ figsurface ] .",
    "all the coupling constants in the theory are the same as those used for the results in fig  [ figexciton ] for the sc phase . only the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath44 are tuned to move the system between the sc and sc+sdw phases .     in the sc+sdw phase .",
    "notice the vertical scale , which shows that the overall modulation in the size of the order parameter is quite small .",
    "the numerical results were obtained by ying zhang and reported in @xcite.,width=336 ]    the spatial fourier transform of fig  [ figsurface ] determines the strength of the elastic bragg peaks that will be observed in neutron scattering .",
    "in particular , the dynamic structure factor of @xmath33 has the form @xmath103 where @xmath104 are the reciprocal lattice vectors of the vortex lattice .",
    "the reader should keep in mind , via ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ ri ] ) , that the experimental structure factor is obtained from ( [ sko ] ) by measuring wavevectors from the sdw ordering wavevectors @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "we show typical results for the field dependence of the strength of the central peak , @xmath105 , and also for the first satellite peak , @xmath106 ( where @xmath107 is the smallest non - zero reciprocal lattice vector ) in fig  [ elastic ] .    ) obtained by the spatial fourier transform of results like those in fig  [ figsurface ] .",
    "the field @xmath44 is measured in units of @xmath108 , the value of the critical field at which all four phases meet in fig  [ figpd ] .",
    "the plot ( a ) is at @xmath43 , while ( b ) is for @xmath41 .",
    "all other couplings are identical to those in figs  [ figexciton ] and  [ figsurface ] .",
    "the numerical results were obtained by ying zhang and reported in @xcite.,width=528 ]    the strong observable effect is in the @xmath44 dependence of the central peak @xmath105 .",
    "the same superflow effects which were responsible for ( [ hs ] ) , also dominate in determining the average magnitude of the sdw order in the sc+sdw phase : we can estimate the enhancement of magnetic order by the superflow by assuming that @xmath109 is determined by @xmath110 , and then ( [ seff ] ) leads to @xmath111 the lines in fig  [ elastic ] are fits of the full numerical solution to ( [ hln ] ) .",
    "@xcite had discussed nucleation of static magnetic order in the vortex core in what was an sc phase .",
    "in contrast , we claim that there are _ no static spins in the vortices in the sc phase _ , and only pinned static charge order around each vortex as discussed in section  [ sec : sc ] .",
    "the static moments appear only when there is bulk magnetic order as in the sc+sdw phase ( as pointed out in @xcite ) , and here it is the contribution of the superflow which always dominates leading to ( [ hln ] ) . the linear small @xmath44 dependence of the ordered moment proposed by arovas _",
    "et al . _ is not valid in either the sc or the sc+sdw phases .",
    "the results in fig  [ elastic ] also compare well with the experimental observations in the overall scale of both the field and the magnetic moment : those in ( a ) are quite similar to the results of @xcite , while ( b ) matches well with @xcite .",
    "finally , note that fig  [ elastic ] shows that the satellite peaks are unobservably small .",
    "this is related to relatively slow modulation induced by the superflow in the moment in fig  [ figsurface ] .",
    "@xcite predicted that the influence of the vortex lattice may be more easily observable in the _ dynamic _ exciton band structure in the sc phase .",
    "the sdw ( @xmath112 ) and charge ( @xmath113 ) ordering wavevectors have so far been arbitrary parameters in our phenomenological theory , and the structure of this theory is largely independent of the values of @xmath112 ( some high order terms in the action are permitted only for certain commensurate values of @xmath112 ) .",
    "the determination of @xmath112 requires , instead , a lattice scale theory of the doped antiferromagnet .",
    "the mechanism of the charge - ordering instability in doped antiferromagnets has been discussed using a number of different theoretical perspectives by several other workers @xcite ; in general , many possible charge - ordering periods emerge in their works , and there appear to be no fundamental principles restricting the possible periods , or whether the charge - ordering is site or bond centered . here , we will briefly recall our theoretical work on charge ordering @xcite : its point of departure is the theory of the magnetic quantum critical point in the mott insulator .",
    "our perspective led to bond - centered charge ordered states , without long - range magnetic order , and with co - existing @xmath9-wave - like superconductivity .",
    "the predicted evolution of the wavevector of this ordering , as a function of hole concentration , is shown in fig  [ fig : dop ] .    .",
    "at @xmath114 , the mott insulator has period 2 , which is associated with the appearance of bond order ( see fig  [ figphase ] ) . beyond a range of very small @xmath8 values ,",
    "the ground state is also a superconductor .",
    "full square lattice symmetry is restored above @xmath115 , when the ground state becomes an ordinary @xmath9-wave superconductor.,width=336 ]    note that the period , @xmath116 , is always pinned to be an even number _ i.e. _ @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the square lattice spacing .",
    "there is a large range of @xmath8 values in fig  [ fig : dop ] where the period is pinned at @xmath119 : this corresponds to the values of @xmath120 observed in the stm experiments @xcite .",
    "both experiments also see the modulation appearing simultaneously at @xmath121 and at @xmath122 , leading to a checkerboard appearance in real space .",
    "such checkerboard patterns have been considered previously for the @xmath123 case @xcite , and were found to have an energy very close to that of the state with charge order only along a single direction ; we can expect that a similar result applies for @xmath119 .",
    "further support for fig  [ fig : dop ] has emerged from recent neutron scattering measurements of mook _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in the under - doped superconductor yba@xmath0cu@xmath124o@xmath125 : they observed static charge order , and dynamic spin correlations , with the the charge order period pinned rather precisely at @xmath126 .",
    "this is in accord with the plateau at @xmath126 over a range of small @xmath8 values in fig  [ fig : dop ] , and should be contrasted with the continuous evolution of ordering wavevector with @xmath8 which is usually assumed in the `` yamada plot '' @xcite for periods larger than @xmath119 .",
    "we conclude this paper by briefly recalling the physical ingredients behind the results in fig  [ fig : dop ] .",
    "a review of these arguments has already been presented in @xcite , and we present here a synopsis in fig  [ figphase ] .     phase diagram ( from refs .",
    "@xcite ) for the high temperature superconductors as a function of a ratio of the near neighbor exchange interactions and the hole concentration , @xmath8 ; _ e.g. _ the vertical axis could be @xmath127 , the ratio of the first to second neighbor exchange .",

    "the ground state at very low non - zero doping is an insulating wigner crystal and there is subsequently a insulator - to - superconductor transition ; superconductivity is present over the bulk of the @xmath130 region .",
    "the central idea behind our approach is that many essential aspects the spin excitation spectrum of the insulating , paramagnetic region ( @xmath114 , @xmath131 ) lead to a simple and natural description of the analogous properties of the @xmath9-wave superconductor.,width=432 ]    in moving from an undoped mott insulator , like la@xmath0cuo@xmath4 , to a high temperature superconductor at optimal doping , at least two quantum phase transitions must take place : one involving the loss of magnetic order , and the other the onset of superconductivity . theoretically , it is very useful to disentangle the two transitions by imagining that we have a second tuning parameter at our disposal , in addition to the doping @xmath8 .",
    "we use this second parameter to first destroy the magnetic order in la@xmath0cuo@xmath4 while remaining at @xmath114a specific possibility for such a parameter is a frustrating second neighbor exchange interaction ( see fig  [ figphase ] ) .",
