    "0 the study of the matter distributions in the borromean nucleus @xmath3 and the neutron rich isotope @xmath4 is an actual problem discussed in many papers ( see , e.g. , in @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "investigations give a reason to expect long tails ( halo ) of the neutron densities .",
    "the first result on the enhancement of the strong interaction radii @xmath5 for @xmath6 was deduced in @xcite from measurements of their interaction cross sections with different target nuclei at fixed energy 800 mev / nucleon .",
    "the same conclusion was made in @xcite about the @xmath0he @xmath7-radii .",
    "later in @xcite , the model densities in the form of a sum of two gaussian functions @xcite were fitted to the data and a conclusion for a significant neutron halo in the outer region of these nuclei was made .",
    "as to the differential elastic scattering cross sections , they were studied in collisions of @xmath0he with protons , and the matter distributions of these nuclei were tested using different phenomenological and theoretical models .",
    "elastic scattering angular distributions of @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath8 , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) were calculated in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , by means of the real part of the optical potentials obtained microscopically by using the realistic m3y - paris effective interaction and taking into account the neutron and proton densities of helium isotopes from @xcite and also derived from the cluster - orbital shell - model approximation ( cosma ) @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that elastic scattering is a good tool to distinguish between different density distributions . the results of @xcite were compared also with those of the alpha - core approach with the fully nonlocal effective interactions @xcite and the no - core model based on the large space shell - model calculations ( lssm ) @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . elastic scattering was recently studied also in @xcite .",
    "at the same time , small experimental information on the energy dependence of the total reaction cross sections of @xmath6 with nuclei is available . generally , from such data for the well - known densities of the target - nuclei , one can get additional constraints on the parameters of the tested models of the halo nuclei .",
    "below , we present our calculations of the total reaction cross - sections and compare them with the respective data on interactions of @xmath6 with @xmath13 at energies e / nucleon @xmath14 10@xmath15 50 mev .",
    "following @xcite we start with the expression for the total reaction cross - sections in the framework of the optical - limit model of the high - energy multiple - scattering theory : + @xmath16 here , the eikonal phase for the scattering of the projectile nucleus ( @xmath17 ) by the target nucleus ( @xmath18 ) is given in @xcite by the expression + @xmath19 + for the isospin averaged total nucleon - nucleon cross - section @xmath20 we use the parametrization from @xcite .",
    "the vectors @xmath21 are in the impact parameter @xmath22 plane perpendicular to the @xmath23- axis along the relative momentum @xmath24 of the two scattered nuclei .",
    "the thickness densities are given as + @xmath25 where the bare density distributions @xmath26 of point nucleons in respective nuclei depend on their coordinates in the center - of - mass frames .",
    "the function @xmath27 is defined by the form of the nucleon - nucleon interaction amplitude .    to present the phase integral in one - dimensional form , one uses the two - dimensional fourier - bessel transformation of all functions in the integrand @xmath28 where @xmath29 this results in : @xmath30",
    "the original high - energy scattering theory uses only the transversal component @xmath31 of the total momentum transfer @xmath32 and neglects its longitudinal component @xmath33 .",
    "here @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the momentum of the relative motion .",
    "so , the theory is applied to the scattering angles @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is approximately the sum of the radii of both the nuclei@xmath38 .",
    "so , in eq.([2.6 ] ) the use of @xmath39 allows one to take the 3-dimensional fourier transforms of the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 instead of the 2-dimensional transforms of their profile functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we remind that the form factors of the point @xmath42 and nuclear @xmath43 densities obey the relation @xmath44 where the nucleon form factor @xmath45 is suggested to be the proton one and has a dipole form which is transformed to the gaussian function at small @xmath46 : @xmath47 at the same time the form @xmath48 of the nn - scattering amplitude is known to be @xmath49 the squared values of the @xmath7 radii of the nucleon and the nn - interaction , known from the experimental data as @xmath50 and @xmath51 , almost coincide .",
    "it was concluded in @xcite that a small difference between these @xmath7 radii does not influence visibly the calculated total reaction cross sections , and , thus , one can use approximately @xmath52 . then taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ 2.7])-([2.9 ] ) we get the phase ( [ 2.6 ] ) in a simple form @xmath53 the form factors @xmath54 can be calculated by using the data on nuclear density distributions . here",

    "the trajectory of the incident nucleus deflects from the scattering center .",
    "this effect can be taken into account replacing he impact parameter @xmath22 in the phase @xmath62 t by the distance of the closest approach @xmath63 in the coulomb field @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the half - distance of the closest approach at @xmath66 .    in our work",
    ", we use models for the projectile nuclei which are known in a table form and , thus , we apply expression ( [ 2.10 ] ) in the calculations where the density @xmath67 of the target nucleus @xmath68 is taken in a realistic form ( [ 2.11 ] ) with @xmath69 and @xmath70 from @xcite . the coulomb distortion effect is also taken into account by using ( [ 2.14 ] ) .",
    "we apply the model for the s - p and s - d shell nuclei , developed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( m - model ) , to calculate the @xmath71he densities .",
    "the densities of these projectile nuclei are used to study the effect of the jastrow - type short range nn - correlations ( src ) , on the total reaction cross - section @xmath71he @xmath72si measured at different energies @xcite .    in the m - model , a general expression for the one - body density matrix of @xmath73 , @xmath74-@xmath17 and",

    "that expression depends on the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) parameter @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , the occupation numbers @xmath78 of the various states and the correlation parameter @xmath79 that comes from the jastrow type correlation function @xmath80 , \\quad r_{ij}=|{\\bf r_i}-{\\bf r_j}|\\ ] ] which introduces short range correlations",
    ". the effect of correlations introduced by the function @xmath81 becomes large when the correlation parameter @xmath79 becomes small and vice versa .",
    "the expression of @xmath82 ( in the two body approximation for the cluster expansion ) has the form @xmath83,\\quad r_b = r / b\\ ] ] where @xmath84 , the uncorrelated density distribution corresponding to the slater determinant ho total wave function , comes from the one - body term of the cluster expansion of the one - body density matrix and the term @xmath85 comes from the two - body term .",
    "their expressions as well as the expression of the normalization factor @xmath86 are given in @xcite .",
    "similar expressions for the form factor and the momentum distribution have also been given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath76 , @xmath79 and @xmath78 can be determined , for each nucleus , by fit to the experimental form factors and momentum distributions . as such data are not available for @xmath71he we will use the data of the total reaction cross - section and the @xmath7-radius .",
    "that is , we involve the parameters @xmath76 , @xmath79 and the four occupation number @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 in the fitting procedure .",
    "we used as experimental data the well known results of tanihata et al @xcite ( t - model ) for the density distributions obtained by fit the total reaction cross - section of @xmath71he @xmath91c at 800 mev in calculation with the model discussed in sec .",
    "1 , using for the target nucleus the gaussian form @xmath92 fitted to the realistic density in the outer region and using for the projectile nucleus the harmonic - oscillator form @xmath93 where @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , @xmath96 are the fitting parameters within the t - model .",
    "expression ( [ 3.3 ] ) and the corresponding expression of the @xmath7-radius have been used as the `` experimental '' data of the projectile nuclei @xmath71he .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath76 , @xmath79 and @xmath78 which have been found by a least squares fit of the theoretical neutron and proton density distributions ( expression ( [ 3.2 ] ) ) to the `` experimental '' ones with the constrain that the two densities have the same @xmath7-radius are given in table i. in the case of proton densities there is one free parameter , the ho parameter .",
    "for that reason the proton density is taken to be the same for both models .    in order to study the effect of src on the density and the total cross section we examined two cases . in the first case we have taken the neutron occupation numbers to be the ones given in table i , we have given to the correlation parameter @xmath79 various values from @xmath97@xmath98 to @xmath99@xmath98 and for each value of @xmath79 we determined the parameter @xmath76 so that the neutron @xmath7-radius to be the same with the one obtained within the t - model . in figure 1 we present the point density distribution for @xmath100he calculated in this case .",
    "the bold curve is the bundle of eight figures .",
    "it is seen that the neutron densities of the m - model have lower tails at @xmath101fm compared to the one of the t - model . at the same time , we see that the cross - sections are in good coincidence .",
    "this means that the main contribution comes from the region @xmath102fm , i.e. , up to @xmath103 equal to about two @xmath7 radius of the @xmath100he nucleus ( the @xmath7-radius of the mater distribution is 2.331 fm for both model ) . from a physical point of view",
    ", the increase of the src at small @xmath79 enhances the nuclear radius , but in the considered case one can think that this effect is compensated by reducing the ho parameter @xmath76 which results in `` squeezing '' the wave functions of the basis .",
    "for that reason we considered the second case where the calculations were made for various values of the parameter @xmath79 in the range @xmath104 to @xmath105@xmath98 while the ho parameter @xmath76 had the value 1.8249 fm and the parameters @xmath78 were taken as before from table i. the results are presented in fig .",
    "the calculations in ref.@xcite showed that the changes of the values of @xmath79 in that region give very significant changes in the form factors and the momentum distributions of nuclei .",
    "in the present paper , we study the total cross - sections and as a result , we obtained the corresponding spread of the @xmath7 radius of the neutron density for @xmath100he in the limit @xmath106fm .",
    "however , this does not noticeably influence the cross - sections . once again , the cross - sections of the m- and the t - models are in coincidence , while the @xmath7 radii are slightly different .",
    "the same conclusions can be made for @xmath107he nucleus from figs .",
    "3 and 4 , where the results of the calculations within the m - model are presented . in fig .",
    "3 , one can see the bunch of nine curves for the neutron densities when the pairs of the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath76 which give the @xmath7-radius @xmath108fm are in the regions @xmath109@xmath98 and @xmath110fm .",
    "the occupation numbers are the ones given in table i. for all the neutron densities the @xmath7-radii are in coincidence with the t - model @xmath111fm .",
    "the matter density radius is also the same in both models @xmath112fm .",
    "the values of the parameters of the curves in fig .",
    "4 are : @xmath113@xmath98 , @xmath114fm and @xmath78 are the same as in fig .",
    "3 . the obtained values of the @xmath7 radii of the neutron densities are in the region @xmath115fm .",
    "we see that in both figures the slopes of the densities from the m - model begin to differ from that of the t - model at about @xmath116fm , where the densities fall down by about two orders of magnitude comparing to the values in the nuclear center .",
    "their difference in the range of twice the @xmath7-radius does not affect the total cross - sections .",
    ".the values of the parameters @xmath76 , @xmath79 and @xmath78 , for the neutron and proton densities of @xmath71he , obtained by fit of the expression ( [ 3.2 ] ) to expression ( [ 3.3 ] ) with the constrain that the two densities to give the same @xmath7-radius .

    "one should mention that in the m - model there were no calculations of the binding energies and the structure of excited states of these nuclei .",
    "however , large - scale shell - model calculations ( lssm ) of the wave functions and characteristics of light exotic nuclei , such as @xmath117 and @xmath118 , were reported by several groups , e.g. .",
    "they are usually performed by using interactions obtained directly from nn g - matrices with various nn - interactions as their base . in @xcite ,",
    "the wave functions for @xmath117 were calculated within a complete 4@xmath119 model space by using the g - matrix with interaction from @xcite .",
    "all calculations were performed by the shell - model code oxbash @xcite .",
    "for @xmath120 the harmonic - oscillator single - particle wave functions were used , while for @xmath117 they were the woods - saxon ones .",
    "it was concluded in @xcite that @xmath3 corresponds to halo nucleus , while @xmath4 is a neutron skin nucleus . in ( and refs .",
    "therein ) , the k - harmonic method was developed and calculations were based on the assumption of the @xmath121 state for each of the valence neutrons related to the alpha - core center ( cosma - model ) .",
    "the admixtures of the 3-body forces is included to get the proper value of the binding energy .    in fig.5",
    ", we show the matter density distributions for @xmath3 obtained from the calculations in the framework of the cosma - model @xcite ( dash - dots ) and the lssm - model @xcite ( dots ) .",
    "the m- and t - model densities are shown by the solid bunch and the dashed curve , respectively .",
    "first of all , one can see that in the outer region the cosma- and lssm - model densities have extended tails which are followed by exponential asymptotics . here",
    ", the dotted curve exceeds the dash - dotted one which results in the enhancement of the corresponding cross section .",
    "it is seen that both the cross sections are about @xmath122 above those calculated by the m- and t - models and the experimental data .",
    "the respective @xmath7 matter radii are @xmath123 ( for the dash - dotted curve ) and @xmath124 ( for the dotted curve ) . in this connection",
    "we refer to @xcite where the coupling of elastic and elastic breakup channels were shown to play an important role in processes with weakly bound nuclei , and this can diminish the cross section obtained without accounting for the additional channels .",
    "recently , the theory of the coupled channels was developed in to study the breakup reactions of halo nuclei . in general , the implied optical - limit model needs higher order nn - scattering terms to be included as had been done in the multiple - scattering theory .",
    "for example , it was shown in @xcite that these terms provide a negative interference and thus diminish the @xmath125 differential elastic cross section calculated by taking into account only the single - scattering term .",
    "the in - medium effect , which changes the free nn - scattering cross section @xmath20 in the phase ( [ 2.2 ] ) can be included as well .",
    "as shown qualitatively in @xcite , this effect can decrease the total nucleus - nucleus reaction cross sections by about 10% .",
    "all the mentioned problems regarding the mechanism of the nucleus - nucleus interaction are still under investigations of the current theory .",
    "however , our study of the total reaction cross - sections of the @xmath6 interactions with the @xmath68 target leads to some general conclusions which , we hope , will not be affected by a possible further modification of the theory .      * the @xmath7 radii are more sensitive nuclear characteristics than the total reaction cross section with respect to changes of the density distributions .",
    "the radius depends strongly on variations of the density in the nuclear interior while the behaviour of the total reaction cross - section depends mainly on the peculiarities of the nuclear surface and weaker on the central nuclear region where strong absorption takes place .",
    "* the previous item explains why variations of the densities due to src do not affect the total cross sections while they are significant in calculations of the form factors and of the single - particle momentum distributions in nuclei at large momentum transfers . *",
    "the fitting procedure in our work showed that there is not a @xmath126-shell contribution to the wave functions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "* in the case of the harmonic - oscillator basis , the gaussian type of the wave function asymptotics does not affect significantly the cross sections and the latter are formed by taking into account the interior region of the projectile nucleus up to about only two @xmath7 nuclear radii .",
    "otherwise , if one gets a basis for realistic wave functions , which have an exponential asymptotics , the region of the main contribution becomes larger and achieves the value of about four and larger times the @xmath7 nuclear radius .",
