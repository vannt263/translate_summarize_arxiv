    "three gaussians are fitted to the spectra showing the main peak ( blue ) , the second peak seen at 6.33 @xmath3 m ( green ) , and the broad 6.5 @xmath3 m `` hump '' ( red ) .",
    "the 6.5 @xmath3 m gaussian on the second off spectrum ( offset  =  + 0.5 ) was fit over a slightly expanded wavelength range to show the feature more clearly . ]",
    "@xcite carry the nitrogenation hypothesis further , determining the necessary site for n - substitution in order to reproduce the observed 6.2 @xmath3 m wavelength and ruling out increasing molecular size alone as the explanation for the observed line profiles .",
    "they find that nitrogen substitution is required to reproduced the observed profiles , labeling this pah subclass polycyclic aromatic nitrogen heterocycles ( panhs ) .",
    "they conclude that pahs or panhs with n - substitution on the edges of the molecule produce the emission at @xmath11  @xmath79  6.3 @xmath3 m , while panhs with the n - atom substituted in the interior of the molecule are responsible for the class a spectra observed by @xcite .    with this observational and theoretical evidence in mind ,",
    "we report a tentative detection of band substructure to the red of the main 6.2 @xmath3 m peak at filament a. filament a spectra are shown in figure 19 from 5.8    7.2 @xmath3 m .",
    "the spectra are dominated by a main class a feature at @xmath142  =  6.210  @xmath36  0.007 @xmath3 m . at the peak filament brightness position",
    ", we observe an enhanced red wing to the main feature .",
    "this wing develops a distinct second peak at 6.33 @xmath3 m as the overall 6.2 band decreases in strength away from the central core of the filament .",
    "an additional red `` hump '' appears further to the red ( @xmath143  6.50 @xmath3 m ) becoming stronger with increasing distance from the peak filament brightness position .",
    "three gaussians are shown overplotted on the data in figure 18 representing each component . the h@xmath6 + [ ] blend is seen near 6.95 @xmath3 m .",
    "the red features are qualitatively similar to the coronene cation ( c@xmath48h@xmath144 ) spectra shown in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "the substructure is most pronounced in the same region where the ionization fraction is seen to increase .",
    "one interpretation is that processing by uv photons is altering the pah population in the interface between the dense filament and the more tenuous nebular regions .",
    "we only see red substructure in one filament b spectrum .",
    "filament b is generally observed to have an unmodified class a 6.2 @xmath3 m band , @xmath142  =  6.219   @xmath36  0.004 @xmath3 m .",
    "we note that a 6.35 @xmath3 m feature was reported as a red shoulder of the 6.2 @xmath3 m band in @xmath20 observations of m17sw  @xcite , interpreted as large pahs under the influence of a strong uv radiation field .",
    "however , @xcite report no detection of a 6.35 @xmath3 m feature .",
    "we have presented new @xmath0 observation of ic 405 , an emission / reflection nebula in auriga illuminated by the runaway o9.5 star hd 34078 .",
    "we have used irs spectroscopy to assess the morphological differences seen in four band ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath3 m ) imaging obtained with irac .",
    "the combination of the irac data with 24 and 70 @xmath3 m mips maps of the nebula reveal wavelength dependent morphology in several subregions .",
    "we attribute these differences to variations in the relative strengths of aefs and emission from grains .",
    "in addition to the aefs , the spectroscopy revealed emission from the pure rotational lines of h@xmath6 and atomic fine structure lines . the emission bands / lines were observed to vary in both absolute and relative strength as a function of position at two bright nebular filaments .",
    "dust temperatures in three nebular filaments were derived from 24 and 70 @xmath3 m photometry .",
    "the dust temperature was a constant 63 k , independent of the distance from the illuminating star . a similar temperature analysis performed on spatial profiles of the 24 and 70 @xmath3 m data obtained near hd 34078",
    "show elevated dust temperatures ( @xmath5  90 k ) in a bow shock ahead of the star , in the direction of stellar motion .",
    "the bow shock scenario is supported by the cometary morphological structure seen in the 8.0 and 24 @xmath3 m images of the stellar region .",
    "we use this data to support the two - component model for the hd 34078 sightline .",
    "the excited h@xmath6 is thought to be associated with the shock region , while the majority of the cold h@xmath6 absorption and dust extinction occurs in an intervening translucent cloud .",
    "the measured aef line strength were found to be anti - correlated with the intensity of the far - uv radiation field in the nebula , possibly due to increased destruction of the aromatics .",
    "the spectroscopic data also were used to constrain the relative ionization state of the aef carrier molecules .",
    "the ionization state was seen to increase with decreasing density in one filament .",
    "this ionization fraction was seen to be anticorrelated with the h@xmath6 emission line strength , consistent with enhanced aef carrier ionization with decreasing density at a given uv radiation field .",
    "evidence was presented for substructure in the 6.2 @xmath3 m aef , suggestive of changing carrier size and/or composition as a function of nebular environment .",
    "line ratios were used to derive the h@xmath6 rotational temperature in two filaments , indicating an average rotational temperature of roughly 400 k , with evidence for additional non - uniform excitation in the filament nearer to the illuminating star .",
    "these measurements were complemented by observations of the far - uv h@xmath6 fluorescence spectrum , providing direct evidence for excitation by uv photons . as new imaging and spectroscopic observations of pdrs become available in the @xmath0 archive , opportunities for comparative studies with existing uv data are made possible . combining the uv and mid - ir observations with near - ir observations of the rovibrational emission lines of h@xmath6 ,",
    "an accounting of the energy redistribution following electronic excitation can be carried out in order to test models of h@xmath6 fluorescence .",
    "a panchromatic h@xmath6 spectrum could be produced in a variety of pdrs , from pure reflection nebulae ( ngc 2023 ) to star - forming regions ( orion bar ) to regions with harder radiation fields ( planetary nebulae such as m 27 ) .",
    "these data would allow models that span a wide range in excitation temperature , density , and radiation field to be compared with observation .",
    "h@xmath6 observations can be compared to the aef and dust properties in these regions in order to explore the relationship between molecular - phase pdr diagnostics and local environmental characteristics .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge b - g andersson for several discussions about the infrared properties of dust grains .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee , whose comments greatly improved the quality of this paper .",
