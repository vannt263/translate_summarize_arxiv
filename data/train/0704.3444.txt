    "multicomponent systems are of great theoretical and practical importance .",
    "an example of an important ternary system , that inspired the current paper , is the formation of polymer membranes through immersion precipitation @xcite . in this process",
    "a polymer - solvent mixture is brought in contact with a non - solvent . as the non - solvent diffuses into the mixture , the mixture phase - separates , leaving behind a complex polymer morphology which depends strongly on the processing conditions .",
    "the dependence of the morphology on the parameters of the system is as yet poorly understood .",
    "preliminary lattice boltzmann simulations of this system exist @xcite",
    ". however , this work did not recover the correct drift diffusion equation .",
    "a general fully consistent lattice boltzmann algorithm with an underlying free energy to simulate multicomponent systems is still lacking .",
    "this paper strives to bring us a step nearer to achieving this goal .",
    "there are several previous lattice boltzmann methods for the simulation of multi - component systems .",
    "there are three main roots for these approaches",
    ". there are those derived from the rothmann - keller approach @xcite that attempt to maximally phase - separate the different components .",
    "a second approach by shan and chen is based on mimicking the microscopic interactions @xcite and a third approach after swift , orlandini and yeomans @xcite is based on an underlying free energy .",
    "all of these have different challenges .",
    "since we are interested in the thermodynamics of phase - separation we find it convenient to work with a method based on a free energy .",
    "this allows us to easily identify the chemical potentials of the components .",
    "this is convenient since the gradients of the chemical potentials drive the phase separation as well as the subsequent phase - ordering .",
    "the challenge for the lb simulation of a multicomponent system lies in the fact that momentum conservation is only valid for the overall system but not for each component separately , and diffusion occurs in the components . for a binary system of components",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 with densities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the simulation usually traces the evolution of the total density @xmath4 and the density difference @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "although this scheme is successful in the simulation of a binary system @xcite , its generalization for the lb simulations of systems with an arbitrary number of components is asymmetric .",
    "for instance , to simulate a ternary system of components @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath6 with densities @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath7 , the total density of the system , @xmath8 , should be traced , and the other two densities to be traced may be chosen as , e.g. , @xmath3 and @xmath9 @xcite . this approach is likely to be asymmetric because the three components are treated differently as is the case of lamura s model @xcite .",
    "if an lb method is not symmetric , it will lose generality an will only be adequate for special applications . in this paper , we established a multicomponent lattice boltzmann method based on an underlying free energy that is manifestly symmetric .",
    "the equation of motion for a multicomponent system are given by the continuity and navier - stokes equations for the overall system and a drift diffusion equation for each component separately .",
    "the continuity equation is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mass density of the fluid , @xmath12 is the mass flux which is given by @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the macroscopic velocity of the fluid .",
    "the navier - stokes equation describes the conservation of momentum : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the pressure and viscous stress tensors respectively , @xmath18 is the component @xmath19 of an external force on a unit mass in a unit volume , and the einstein summation convention is used . for newtonian fluids , the viscous stress tensor is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the shear viscosity , and @xmath22 is bulk viscosity , and @xmath23 is the spacial dimension of the system .",
    "free energy , chemical potential , and pressure are key thermodynamic concepts to understand the phase behavior of a system .",
    "the chemical potential of each component can be obtained by a functional derivative as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the chemical potential of component @xmath26 ; @xmath27 is the number density of component @xmath26 ; and @xmath28 is the total free energy of the system .",
    "the pressure in a bulk phase in equilibrium is given by @xmath29 the pressure tensor is determined by two constraints : @xmath30 in the bulk and @xmath31 everywhere .    in multicomponent systems , there are two mechanisms for mass transport : convection and diffusion .",
    "convection is the flow of the overall fluid , while diffusion occurs where the average velocities of components are different .",
    "the velocity of the overall fluid is a macroscopic quantity because it is conserved , but the average velocities of the components are not .",
    "the macroscopic velocity of the fluid @xmath32 can be expressed in terms of the density @xmath33 and velocity @xmath34 of each component in the form of @xmath35 with the notation @xmath36 the flux of each component can be divided into a convection part @xmath37 and a diffusion part @xmath38 : @xmath39 because mass conservation still holds for each component , the continuity equation for each component is valid : @xmath40 substituting eq .",

    "@xmath41 from eqs .",
    "( [ uaverage ] ) and ( [ dsl ] ) , we see that @xmath42 which ensures the recovery of the continuity equation for the overall system .",
    "the diffusion process between two components is related to the difference of the chemical potential of the two components , which is also called the exchange chemical potential @xcite . recognizing that the gradient of the exchange chemical potential determines the diffusion processes , we obtain a first order approximation for the diffusion flux of one component into all other components as @xmath43 where @xmath26 and @xmath44 enumerate the components ; @xmath25 and @xmath45 are the chemical potentials of components @xmath26 and",
