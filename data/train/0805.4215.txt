    "far - infrared and sub - millimeter continuum radiation from interstellar clouds is typically attributed mostly to `` dust . '' in truth , however , even the contributions from `` dust '' come from multiple populations of grain types , which are each at a mixture of temperatures . along any given line of sight",
    ", there may be random or systematic variations both in the admixture of grain types and in their temperature , and those variations may or may not be correlated .",
    "historically , researchers have used more and more complicated procedures to account for dust emission and estimate column density .    the simplest way to infer column density from `` thermal '' dust emission is to assume a single grain type , radiating with a single efficiency ( opacity ) , at a single temperature . in that case ,",
    "flux at any wavelength can be converted to a column density , assuming a dust temperature .",
    "the next - most - sophisticated approach is to use observations at two wavelengths , and to infer a color temperature , by assuming that the dust emission comes from a modified blackbody , which has a wavelength - dependent emissivity one takes as given ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with observations at three wavelengths",
    ", it should be possible to also constrain the dust emissivity , assuming its functional dependence on wavelength is known and is described by just one parameter ( @xmath0 ) . as @xcite have shown , however ,",
    "a three - wavelength constraint on @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 independently is only possible for the case of very ( to date unrealistically ) high signal - to - noise data . nevertheless , with three wavelengths of very high s / n , or measurements at four or more wavelengths",
    ", one could constrain the temperature , column density and emissivity independently  if only all the mixtures of grains along lines of sight were similar , and the temperature distribution along the line of sight were isothermal .    in an earlier paper , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter sbg ) , we showed that line - of - sight variations in the dust temperature account for nearly all the scatter in a plot of dust - emission vs. dust - extinction derived column density in the perseus molecular cloud . in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter srgl ) , we found that very small grains ( vsg s ) are likely to account for a large fraction ( @xmath4% ) of the dust emission at wavelengths shorter that 100 .",
    "if that fraction is relatively constant , then one can say that big grains ( bg s ) are a good proxy for column density , modulo the uncertainty imposed by the line - of - sight variations in the dust temperature . however , if the vsg contribution is not constant , but depends on either @xmath2 or @xmath1 , then the situation is further confounded . in this paper ,",
    "we explore all of these possibilities , and we find , in agreement with earlier works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that the vsg contribution does seem to vary systematically with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and that it is important to account for this effect in estimates of dust column density and dust temperature .",
    "srgl showed that far - infrared emission maps can be used to determine the dust temperature and column density in molecular clouds once the conversion between fir optical depth and @xmath5-band extinction has been determined .",
    "this analysis took advantage of the iris ( improved reprocessing of the iras survey ) maps at 60 and 100  @xcite and near - infrared extinction map created from 2mass data as part of the complete ( coordinated molecular probe line extinction and thermal emission ) survey of star forming regions @xcite .",
    "subsequently , sbg demonstrated that the column density determined from pairs of fir emission maps should become more accurate and less biased when the emission is measured at longer wavelengths due to the decreased influence of line - of - sight temperature variations .    with the recent release of 70 and 160  maps of perseus taken with the spitzer space telescope @xcite , we can improve upon the srgl analysis . in this short paper , we combine the 100  iris and 160  spitzer maps to derive dust temperature and column density maps that are not strongly biased by the emission from transiently heated vsg s .",
    "in addition we are able to estimate the variation of the vsg emission and bg emissivity with @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
    "we used the 70 and 160  emission maps of the perseus molecular cloud from the spitzer science archive that were taken as part of the spitzer legacy program `` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks '' ( c2d ) @xcite .",
    "map resolutions are 18  and 40  at 70 and 160 , respectively .",
    "the c2d delivery includes error maps , which account for systematic and random errors .",
    "the overall gain calibration uncertainty is @xmath75% at 70  @xcite and @xmath712% at 160 @xcite .",
    "the c2d error maps show that the random error for maps smoothed to 5  resolution ( the resolution of the extinction map ) is @xmath81% at both 70 and 160 .",
    "we applied color corrections to these archival fluxes since they were determined assuming that the emission is from a blackbody at 10,000 k while we have assumed that the emission comes from a modified blackbody with emissivity spectral index @xmath9 @xcite and equilibrium temperature to be determined , but certainly less than 10,000 k @xcite .",
    "the color correction , which is combined with the dust temperature calculation , is futher described in sect",
    ".  [ td ] .",
    "iris flux density maps at 60 and 100 , in contrast with earlier releases of the iras all - sky maps , have been corrected for the effects of zodiacal dust and striping , and have the proper gain and offset calibration @xcite .",
    "the iris maps of perseus have a resolution of approximately 43 ( though we smooth them to the 5  resolution of our nir extinction map for all analyses ) .",
    "the noise in the iras maps is approximately 0.03 mjy sr@xmath10 and 0.06 mjy sr@xmath10 at 60 and 100  @xcite , which is @xmath111% of the flux in the portion of perseus included in the c2d survey . like the spitzer maps , these were color - corrected by us ( following the iras explanatory supplement vi c.3 ) . for consistency , we consider only the region of perseus covered by the c2d mips maps at 70 and 160  in this analysis .",
    "an extinction map of perseus based on the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog was created as part of the complete survey @xcite using the nicer algorithm , devised by @xcite .",
    "this algorithm uses the near - infrared color excess of background stars to estimate the column density of foreground dust . when directly comparing nir and fir - derived column densities ( e.g. , figs",
    ".  [ tauavtemp ] , [ avscatter ] and [ plothist ] ) , all maps have been smoothed to a common resolution of 5 , since that is the resolution of the nicer extinction map of perseus .",
    "the flux density emitted by dust in thermal equilibrium is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13    in equation [ dustflux ] , @xmath14 is the observed flux density at frequency @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is the solid angle of the beam ; @xmath17 is the blackbody emission from the dust at temperature @xmath1 ; @xmath2 is the column density of dust , @xmath18 is a constant that relates the flux density to the optical depth of the dust at frequency @xmath15 , and @xmath3 is the emissivity spectral index of the dust , which we assume to be 2 throughout this paper @xcite . in srgl",
    "we showed that @xmath9 is a reasonable value for the cold dust in perseus .",
    "equation [ dustflux ] is only true for bg s in thermal equilibrium , and does not describe the emission from stochastically heated vsg s , which can not be characterized by an equilibrium temperature @xcite .",
    "the vsg s are expected to be a significant component of the observed emission in the iras 60  and spitzer 70  bands , but are not expected to contribute much in the iras 100  and spitzer 160  bands @xcite .",
    "if we were to ignore the vsg emission , we would systematically overestimate the dust temperature and underestimate the column density in perseus .",
    "we therefore account for it using a procedure that improves upon that adopted by srgl , as described below .",
    "the fluxes quoted in the iras and spitzer emission maps are derived from the total energy detected convolved with the wavelength - dependent instrumental response and an assumed sed of the emitting source .",
    "the quoted flux density at wavelength @xmath19 is related to the intrinsic flux density by :    @xmath20    @xcite where @xmath21 is the true source sed , @xmath22 is the default sed and @xmath23 is the instrumental response function ( the sensivity of the detector as a function of wavelength ) .",
    "the default sed for the spitzer data is that of a 10,000 k blackbody , while the default sed for the iris data is @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that the intrinsic sed is a modified blackbody with @xmath3 = 2 @xcite , so the color correction is temperature dependent .    to derive the color correction and dust temperature , we create a lookup table of the intrinsic flux density at @xmath25 60 , 70 , 100 and 160  for dust at temperatures between 5 and 100 k , at 0.1 k intervals .",
    "we then calculate what flux density would have been quoted at those wavelengths using eq .",
    "[ fquote ] . using this table , we are able to derive the color - corrected dust temperature from the ratio of the _ quoted _ flux densities , making the assumption that the dust emission is optically thin and isothermal along each line of sight .",
    "the iras 100  and spitzer 160  maps are not significantly corrupted by vsg emission , so we derive a dust temperature map using our lookup table and the quoted @xmath26 after smoothing the emission maps to a common ( 5 ) resolution .    the iras 60 and spitzer 70  flux densities come from a combination of bg and vsg emission , but equations [ dustflux ] and [ fquote ] are only accurate for bg emission . in srgl",
    "we removed the vsg emission by assuming that a constant fraction of all 60 emission can be attributed to vsg s .",
    "this proportion was found by minimizing the difference between the temperature maps derived from iris data and the dust temperature map derived by @xcite , which was derived from dirbe 100 and 240  emission ( and therefore free from vsg contamination ) .",
    "however , the proportion of 60 and 70  flux emitted by vsg s is expected to vary with environment . in regions with high extinction",
    ", the vsg s will be shielded from the isrf and will therefore not be effectively heated . in cold ,",
    "dense regions dust grains may stick together , removing the vsg population . for instance , @xcite have shown that the vsg emission is greatly reduced in a dense filament in taurus where @xmath27 and found a corresponding increase in the dust emissivity .",
    "a similar transition region of altered dust composition has been reported using iras 60 and 100  emission maps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    "we take advantage of the higher resolution of the iras 100 and spizter 160  images , as compared with the dirbe maps , to remove the emission from vsg s accounting for spatial variations in their contribution .",
    "we divide our 100/160  derived temperature maps into ten equally populated temperature and extinction subsets ( five temperature subsets for @xmath6 less than the median nir - derived extinction and five temperature subsets for higher @xmath6 ) and calculate the vsg contribution to the 60 and 70  emission independently for each bin using the dust temperature derived from the 100/160  pair of emission maps . in each bin",
    ", we multiply the 60 and 70  emission ( smoothed to 5  resolution ) by the scaling factors @xmath28 and @xmath29 which are chosen such that the temperatures derived from @xmath30 and @xmath31 are best matched to the dust temperature derived from @xmath26 .",
    "the comparatively low resolution of the dirbe - derived temperature map prevented us from performing this more sophisticated correction in srgl .",
    "the scale factors ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) used to account for the vsg emission are shown in fig .",
    "[ bgconversion ] . our assumptions that dust is isothermal along each line of sight and that the dust emissivity ( characterized by @xmath18 and @xmath3 in eq .",
    "[ dustflux ] ) is constant introduce uncertainties into our calculations .",
    "the effect of assuming isothermality is covered in sbg , and we discuss the effects of variable dust emissivity in section [ vardust ] .      given the flux density at one wavelength and the dust temperature , the optical depth is given by :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the planck function and @xmath34 is the observed flux density at wavelength @xmath35 .",
    "the optical depth at wavelength @xmath35 can be converted to the @xmath5-band extinction ( a@xmath36 ) using the equation    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the scale factor , depending on the wavelength ( @xmath35 ) of the emission map , that relates the thermal emission properties of the dust grains to their @xmath5-band absorption properties ( eq .  5 from srgl ) .",
    "we solve for @xmath38 for each pair of emission maps by minimizing the difference between the emission - derived column density ( smoothed to the resolution of the extinction map ) and the 2mass absorption - derived column density , as in srgl and sbg .",
    "for the 60/100 and 100/160 pair of emission maps we derive the optical depth and conversion factor ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) from the 100  emission map . for the 70/160 pair of emission maps we derive @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and scale both values in figures [ bgconversion ] and [ tauavtemp ] to the expected values at 100  assuming @xmath9 using the scale factor @xmath43 .",
    "the optimization sets the overall calibration for the fir data , but does not force the slope of nir - derived column density plotted against fir - derived column density to be exactly unity , though it will be close to this value .",
    "variations in temperature along each line of sight will affect the emission - derived @xmath6 at high column density more than at low column density , and the extinction - derived @xmath6 is unaffected by temperature fluctuations .",
    "this difference in the way the dust temperature is coupled to the derived column density , along with possible variations in the fir dust emissivity , can change the slope of the emission vs. absorption - derived column density to be slightly different from unity .",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ aveq ] assumes that the dust emission and absorption properties are constant .",
    "the linear relationship between @xmath44 and @xmath6 is shown in fig .",
    "[ tauavtemp ] .      just as the emission from vsg s",
    "is expected to vary with environment , so should the dust emissivity , due to such factors as grain growth through sticking and the formation of icy mantles . as a result of these processes , the dust emissivity in regions with higher column density and lower dust temperature",
    "is seen to be higher .",
    "this effect has been observed in many environments ( e.g. kiss et al .",
    "2006 ; del burgo & laureijs 2005 ; bernard et al .",
    "1999 ) , where it is shown that the fir emissivity ( @xmath18 in eq .",
    "[ dustflux ] or @xmath38 in eq .",
    "[ aveq ] ) anti - correlates with dust temperature and varies by a factor of a few in interstellar clouds similar to perseus . in fig .",
    "[ tauavtemp ] we show the fir dust emissivity ( expressed as the ratio of the 100  optical depth and nir - derived extinction ) plotted against the color temperature of the dust .",
    "we also find this dependence of the emissivity on temperature and column density , which suggests that the linear fit between @xmath44 and a@xmath36 ( see eq .  [ aveq ] and fig .",
    "[ tauavtemp ] ) does not fully describe the relationship between dust emission and absorption .",
    "it is important to note that temperature fluctuations along the line of sight can give the appearance of a temperature - dependent emissivity when the dust is assumed to be isothermal , even if the true dust emissivity is constant . because the line - of - sight averaged dust temperature is emission weighted , the dust temperature is overestimated and the far - infrared optical depth is underestimated .",
    "this effect is larger along lines of sight with greater temperature variation ( i.e. , those passing through denser regions ) , which are preferentially colder than the more diffuse ( and nearly isothermal ) portions of the molecular cloud . as a consequence ,",
    "the derived ratio of the far - infrared optical depth to extinction will be underestimated in the colder , denser regions of the molecular cloud .",
    "however , the observed temperature - dependent dust emissivity varies in the _ opposite direction _ of the correlation created by line - of - sight temperature fluctuations .",
    "the observed dust emissivity is _ larger _ at low temperatures , supporting the claim that the true dust emissivity is variable .",
    "noise in the fir emission maps can also give the appearance of a variable dust emissivity .",
    "if noise changes the ratio of the fluxes , then the dust temperature will be either overestimated or underestimated .",
    "a high dust temperature will result in a low fir - derived optical depth , and a low dust temperature will result in a high fir optical depth . to illustrate the effect of noise on the derived dust emissivity",
    ", we analyze a simple model of a molecular cloud with constant dust emissivity in which the temperature is anti - correlated with column density and with both quantities are within a typical range for molecular clouds .",
    "we then derive the flux at 100 and 160  flux that would be emitted and add gaussian random noise to the maps .",
    "we re - derive the dust temperature and 100  optical depth from the noisy maps and show the dust emissivity that would be estimated from the `` observed '' maps plotted against the temperature .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ noisefig ] .",
    "the dust emissivity that we derive in perseus ( see fig .  [ avscatter ] ) looks similar to what one would expect from maps of dust that have a constant emissivity , but that have noise on the level of @xmath715% .",
    "however , the random noise in all of our maps is much lower than this ( @xmath111% ) , so we can rule out the possibility that noise in the perseus emission maps is tricking us into thinking that the dust emissivity is variable .    to account for the variable dust emissivity in the determination of the dust column density , we divide our data into the same ten equally populated bins as we did in section [ td ] , based on their nir - derived extinction and temperature . using eq .",
    "[ aveq ] , we derive the conversion ( @xmath38 ) separately for each bin and each pair of emission maps .",
    "the derived dust emissivity , as a function of @xmath1 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ bgconversion ] .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ bgconversion ] , the 60 and 70  emission is dominated by the emission from vsg s .",
    "the fractional contribution of bg emission rises with increasing @xmath1 at both 60 and 70 .",
    "this is no surprise , given that warmer dust will have larger 60/100 and 70/160  flux ratios . at 70 , the bg contribution is a larger percentage of the total flux for @xmath45 than @xmath46 , while at 60  the difference is smaller and changes sign .",
    "this difference may be caused by the 60 and 70  passbands , since iras is sensitive ( sensitiviy @xmath47 10% ) from 37 to 82 while spitzer is sensitive from 55 to 86 .",
    "the parameter used to derive the dust column density from the fir optical depth of the dust , as given by @xmath38 in eq .",
    "[ aveq ] , varies nearly identically with @xmath1 for all three pairs of emission maps . the evolution in @xmath38 is primarily caused by the variable emissivity of the dust ( shown in fig .",
    "[ tauavtemp ] ) , but also by line - of - sight temperature fluctuations and noise in the emission maps . taking into account variations in the vsg contribution to emission from dust with @xmath48  and variations in the emissivity of",
    "the bg s represents an increase in the complexity of the analysis performed in srgl .",
    "as discussed in srgl , the point to point scatter between emission and absorption - derived column density can be quite large ( a few tens of percent ) .",
    "this scatter can be attributed to line - of - sight temperature fluctions , non - constant dust emissivity and variations in the fraction of emission coming from vsg s ( though this last source of error should not affect the column density derived from emission maps at or above @xmath7100 ) .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the emission - derived column density in two ways . in the first method",
    "we assume that the dust emissivity is constant in perseus , and that @xmath6 scales with the fir optical depth ( eq .  [ aveq ] ) .",
    "our second method uses a dust emissivity which varies with @xmath6 and @xmath1 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bgconversion ] . in both cases we correct for variations in the relative vsg / bg contribution to the 60 and 70  emission , as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath6 , as described in section [ td ] .",
    "the values for the median column density ratio , the scatter around that median , and the slope of the best fit line between the emission vs absorption - derived column density for perseus are shown in table [ columntab ] and the corresponding plots are shown in fig .",
    "[ avscatter ] .    in sbg , we use a simplified model of emission from an externally heated molecular cloud to study the effects of line - of - sight temperature variations on column density estimates without having to worry about the effects of vsg emission or variations in the dust emissivity . using that model ,",
    "we predict that the scatter and bias should be largest for the 60/100  pair of maps and smallest for the 100/160  pair . however , in this paper , when we use a single @xmath49 conversion , we find that the slope and scatter between our emission and absorption - derived column densities are very similar for all three pairs of emission maps , in conflict with sbg .",
    "the amount of scatter in the nir vs. 60/100 -derived column density is consistent with that predicted by the model in sbg .",
    "the larger than expected scatter seen in the 70/160 is probably not caused by an improper vsg correction , since we also find excess scatter in the nir vs. 100/160 -derived column density , and vsg emission should be insignificant in the 100 and 160  maps .",
    "when we divide the emission maps into ten subsets and derive the @xmath50 conversion for each bin ( shown in fig .",
    "[ bgconversion ] ) , there is less bias in the emission - derived column density .",
    "this is shown by the fit between the fir and nir - derived column density in fig .",
    "[ avscatter ] , which has a slope @xmath71 .",
    "however , the scatter in the relation ( see table [ columntab ] ) is only significantly improved for the 100/160  derived column density compared to the constant @xmath49 derivation .",
    "this suggests that the emission properties of dust are more complicated than assumed in this paper .",
    "for instance , the emissivity ( or spectral index ) of the dust could be density - dependent or there could be variations in grain properties as a function of position in perseus , and not merely as a function of dust temperature and column density .",
    "we conclude that the 100/160  pair of maps is the best for deriving dust temperature and column density because it is least affected by the emission from vsg s and has the least nir vs. fir column density scatter",
    ". however , since the 70/160 pair of emission maps has much better resolution , the column density and dust temperature maps produced from it are also useful if one is willing to accept the additional uncertainty of using maps presented at @xmath51  that have been calibrated on a @xmath52  scale .      here",
    "we present dust temperature and column density maps derived from the iras and spitzer fluxes .",
    "figures [ maps160100 ] , [ maps10060 ] and [ maps16070 ] show the temperature and column density maps derived from the iras and spitzer far - infrared data and are presented at @xmath75  resolution ( which is the resolution of the nir - derived extinction map and is approximately the resolution of the iris 60 and 100  maps ) .",
    "figure [ maps16070high ] is derived from the spitzer 70 and 160  data , and is presented at the 40  resolution of the 160  map ( the 70 emission map was smoothed to the resolution of the 160  map ) .",
    "the column densities are determined by assuming a variable dust emissivity , as described in section [ vardust ] .",
    "note that the vsg subtraction and variable dust emissivity are calibrated at 5resolution , so the calibration of the dust temperature and column density using the spitzer 70 and 160  maps present at 40  resolution is more uncertain than the maps presented at 5  resolution .",
    "figure [ plothist ] shows histograms of the dust temperature and column density distributions derived from from pairs of emission maps at 60/100 , 70/160 and 100/160 .",
    "the 60 and 70  fluxes have been scaled to remove the vsg emission ( as explained in section [ td ] ) .",
    "the median temperature derived for this region of the perseus molecular cloud by @xcite is 16.5 k , whereas we derive a median temperature of 15.0 k , so our derived temperature is about 10% lower .",
    "the emission - derived column density is scaled to match that derived from the nir reddening of background stars .",
    "therefore , it is no surprise that the @xmath6 distributions in all three panels of fig .",
    "[ plothist ] are similar to that of the extinction map .",
    "using spitzer 70 and 160  maps released by the c2d legacy project , we have created high - resolution dust temperature and column density maps of the perseus molecular cloud .",
    "although smaller in area than similar maps presented in srgl using iras and 2mass data , the maps in this paper ( fig .  [ maps16070 ] ) are better calibrated to account for variations in the dust emissivity and removal of vsg emission . combining the spitzer 160  map with the iras 100  map",
    "we show that the dust temperature in perseus is significantly colder ( by @xmath710% ) than reported in the dust temperature map derived by @xcite .",
    "we find that the dust emissivity varies with @xmath6 and @xmath1 , in agreement with the results of @xcite and @xcite . by fitting the absorption - derived column density to the fir opacity in each of ten subsets of the data",
    ", we demonstrate an improved method for calculating the emission - derived dust column density .",
    "the column density derived from the 60/100  pair of emission maps , when compared with the nir @xmath6 , has slope and scatter consistent with those expected from variations in temperature along the line of sight .",
    "however , the scatter between the absorption - derived and 70/160 and 100/160  emission - derived column density is larger than would be expected from line - of - sight variations in the dust temperature alone .",
    "one possible explanation for the large scatter is that the 160  map is more sensitive to the emission from cold dust grains than are the 60 and 100  maps ( sbg ) , and the dust emissivity varies more strongly at colder ( t@xmath53 k ) temperatures .",
    "although the origin of the observed temperature dependence is uncertain , recent theoretical models of amorphous dust grains by @xcite and @xcite also exhibit an anti - correlation between dust temperature and emissivity .",
    "another possible cause for the higher dust emissivity at lower temperatures is that the dust grains could be accreting icy mantles in the dense and colder regions within the molecular cloud .",
    "regardless of the reason , it is not surprising that dust grains with a higher emissivity , given their ability to cool more efficiently , will be found at lower equilibrium temperatures .",
    "a temperature - dependent dust emissivity presents a challenge for those attempting to derive dust temperatures and column densities from fir emission maps . in sbg , we suggest that longer - wavelength ( @xmath54 ) emission maps should be used to calculate the line - of - sight dust properties because of their decreased sensitivity to fluctuations in the dust temperature and the lack of confusing emission from vsg s . in this paper , we show that the dust emissivity anti - correlates with dust temperature , and that the variability is likely to increase at lower temperatures , an effect which is also seen in other regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this complicates the interpretation of longer wavelength emission maps , which are more sensitive to cold dust .",
    "the deleterious effects of vsg emission , temperature gradients , and variable dust emission properties add complexity to the determination of the mass and temperature distributions of dust in a molecular cloud .",
    "resolution of these problems may require coverage from tens to hundreds of microns , finer spectral resolution than the broad iras and spitzer filters provide , and comparison with dust emission models of `` realistic '' molecular clouds .",
    "given the complexity of determining column density from dust emission , one may wonder if using extinction might be a superior method .",
    "for instance , the extinction map of perseus made with 2mass data and the nicer algorithm @xcite is used as a template with which we calibrate the emission - derived column density in this paper , and we trust extinction - derived column density more than that derived from dust emission in general @xcite .",
    "the resolution of extinction maps is limited by the number of background tracers with known color , which provide 1  resolution for clouds nearby the galactic center in projection @xcite , but is coarser towards clouds further away from the galactic plane",
    ". however , emission maps are limited only by the size of the detector and also provide information on the dust temperature .",

    "<S> using far - infrared emission maps taken by iras and spitzer and a near - infrared extinction map derived from 2mass data , we have made dust temperature and column density maps of the perseus molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the emission from transiently heated very small grains and the big grain dust emissivity vary as a function of extinction and dust temperature , with higher dust emissivities for colder grains . </S>",
    "<S> this variable emissivity can not be explained by temperature gradients along the line of sight or by noise in the emission maps , but is consistent with grain growth in the higher density and lower temperature regions . by accounting for the variations in the dust emissivity and vsg emission , we are able to map the temperature and column density of a nearby molecular cloud with better accuracy than has previously been possible . </S>"
