    "the recent observation of cp violation in the @xmath0-meson system , by dint of the measurement of a nonzero , cp - violating asymmetry in the decay @xmath1 and related modes  @xcite , opens a new era of discovery . at issue",
    "is whether or not cp violation is realized exclusively through a single phase , @xmath2 , in the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite , as in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the observed asymmetry , realized through the interference of @xmath3-@xmath4 mixing and direct decay , is in accord with sm expectations  @xcite , but additional , critical tests of the sm picture have as yet to be realized .",
    "for example , the @xmath1 result , coupled with the hierarchical nature of the ckm matrix  @xcite , suggests that significant direct cp - violating effects ought to exist in the @xmath0-meson system .",
    "moreover , the determined angles of the unitarity triangle , whatever they may be , must be universal , and they must sum to a multiple of @xmath5  @xcite . in this paper , we study a new method of elucidating the presence of direct cp violation .",
    "the empirical observation of direct cp violation in the @xmath0 system would falsify models in which cp violation is associated overwhelmingly with @xmath6 , rather than @xmath7 , processes : such models are `` essentially '' superweak  @xcite .",
    "the observation of direct cp violation in the @xmath0-meson system is needed to clarify the nature and origin of cp violation in nature .",
    "direct cp violation ( dcpv ) in the @xmath0-meson system is realized if @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the decay amplitude for @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the decay amplitude for the cp - conjugate process @xmath12 ; it can be established in a variety of ways .",
    "let us consider the possibilities .",
    "perhaps most familiar is the partial - rate asymmetry , @xmath13 , for which @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "no conclusive evidence for dcpv has been found thus far , although early results in certain modes have been quite suggestive  @xcite .",
    "another pathway to dcpv is realized through the comparison of @xmath16 , the cp - violating asymmetry associated with the interference of @xmath17 mixing and direct decay , for two different self - conjugate final states @xmath18 . were @xmath19 nonzero for a final state @xmath18 , one would establish the existence of dcpv , as in the manner of the @xmath20 parameter in the neutral - kaon system .",
    "indeed , such a difference has been termed @xmath21  @xcite . experimentally , there is no conclusive evidence , as yet , for a nonzero @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath21 can vanish for a specific final state , such as @xmath22 , even if dcpv is present in nature  @xcite .",
    "direct cp violation can also be established through the study of the angular distribution of @xmath0 decays into two vector mesons  @xcite , though no empirical limits on the dcpv terms exist as yet .",
    "finally , dcpv can be established through a population asymmetry in the dalitz plot associated with the untagged decay rate into self - conjugate final states  @xcite , as we will develop in detail .",
    "the last two methods have common elements ; in particular , neither method requires tagging nor time - dependence to find dcpv in the neutral @xmath0-meson system .    in this paper",
    ", we study the method proposed in ref .",

    "nevertheless , we shall persist in using the phrase `` self - conjugate '' to describe multi - particle states which are `` cp self - conjugate states in particle content ''  @xcite . ] .",
    "the multi - particle ( @xmath23 ) final states realized in heavy - meson decays possess a rich resonance structure , entailing the possibility of detecting dcpv without tagging the flavor of the decaying neutral meson .",
    "for example , dcpv can occur if we can separate the self - conjugate final state , via the resonances which appear , into distinct , cp - conjugate states .",
    "this condition finds it analogue in stereochemistry : we refer to molecules which are non - superimposable , mirror images of each other as enantiomers  @xcite , so that we term non - superimposable , cp - conjugate states as cp - enantiomers  @xcite . in @xmath24 decay ,",
    "e.g. , the intermediate states @xmath25 and @xmath26 form cp - enantiomers , as they are distinct , cp - conjugate states . as a result",
    ", the untagged decay rate contains a cp - odd amplitude combination .",
    "the empirical presence of this cp - odd interference term in the untagged decay rate would be realized in the dalitz plot as a population asymmetry , reflective of direct cp violation  @xcite .",
    "the use of untagged decays to search for direct cp violation is also possible in @xmath27 decays ; its practical advantage is that there is no loss of statistics due to tagging .",
