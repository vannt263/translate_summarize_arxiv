    "<S> self - induced transparency mode - locking ( or coherent mode - locking , cml ) which is based on intracavity self - induced transparency soliton dynamics , allows potentially to achieve nearly single cycle intracavity pulse durations , much below the phase relaxation time @xmath0 in a laser , which , despite of great promise , has not yet been realized experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a diagram technique which allows to predict the main features of cml regimes in a generic two - section laser . </S>",
    "<S> we show that cml can arise directly at the first laser threshold if the phase relaxation time is large enough </S>",
    "<S> . furthermore , cml regimes can be unconditionally stable . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict the existence of  super - cml regimes  , with a pulse coupled to several rabi oscillations in the nonlinear medium .    </S>",
    "<S> ultrashort optical pulses with durations of a few hundreds femtoseconds ( or picoseconds ) are used in different applications ranging from real - time monitoring of chemical reactions to high - bit - rate optical communications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main technique to obtain such pulses nowadays is a passive mode - locking . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse duration in such lasers is fundamentally limited by the inverse bandwidth of the gain medium @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> this very basic limitation is not valid anymore when the electric field is so strong , that rabi oscillations in both gain and absorber sections are existed . </S>",
    "<S> the general idea of coherent modelocking ( cml ) @xcite is that a self - induced transparency ( sit ) soliton ( or @xmath2 pulse ) @xcite propagates stably in the absorber , whereas the gain section is arranged in such a way that the very same pulse ( with the same shape ) propagates there as a @xmath3 pulse . because of this , it `` feeds '' the energy from the gain medium @xcite , which makes it shorter . at the end , </S>",
    "<S> a stable equilibrium is set up due to balance of losses and gain , which defines finally the pulse duration . </S>",
    "<S> if the linear losses are small enough , the pulse duration will decrease until stopped by other mechanisms such as intracavity dispersion @xcite .    up to </S>",
    "<S> now there were no clear experimental observation of the cml regime , although some work was made to improve theoretical description and to observe some elements of cml experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time , in @xcite the cml was predicted theoretically to quantum cascade lasers ; in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite experimental evidence of mode - locking regime in a laser with a coherent absorber has been reported ( the gain section remained in incoherent regime ) .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we show that cml might be easier accessible than was though before . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a technique based on the well known mccall and hahn area theorem which determines the evolution of the pulse area in the cml laser . using this technique </S>",
    "<S> we show that in a wide range of parameters cml regime is a stable attractor of the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate furthermore the regimes we call super - cml where pulse area in absorber may approach @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 instead of the only known case of @xmath7 . in order to keep the theory </S>",
    "<S> simple we will use the parameters where the pulse duration is far above the single - cycle pulse duration but still in the femtosecond range .    </S>",
    "<S> an important quantity describing the pulse dynamics in the coherent regime is the pulse area , defined as @xcite @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the transition dipole moment of two - level particles , and @xmath10 is the pulse envelope . </S>",
    "<S> the area @xmath11 of a stable sit - induced soliton is @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the basic result of the sit theory is the so - called pulse area theorem . </S>",
    "<S> this theorem governs the evolution of the pulse area @xmath11 during its propagation in a two - level absorbing ( or amplifying ) medium with an inhomogeneously broadened line @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the absorption coefficient per unit length , @xmath14 is the concentration of two - level particles , @xmath15 is the medium transition frequency and @xmath16 is the width of inhomogeneously broadened line . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqareatheorem ] ) is valid in the limit of negligible homogeneous broadening @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqareatheorem ] ) is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the initial pulse area.@xmath20 is an unstable steady - state of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqareatheorem ] ) whereas @xmath21 are stable ones . </S>",
    "<S> coherent pulse propagation in an amplifying medium can be also described by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqareatheorem ] ) simply assuming the opposite sign of @xmath22 . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqareatheorem ] ) it follows that the same diagram can be used , only the opposite @xmath23-direction is to be taken . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath20 is a stable point . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a stable @xmath2 soliton in an absorbing medium , and a stable @xmath3 soliton in a gain medium can be formed .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a cml laser operating in a unidirectional lasing regime shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr1]a with the absorbing and amplifying media separated in space . in order to achieve the same pulse shape for @xmath2-pulses and @xmath3-pulses in the absorber and amplifier </S>",
    "<S> respectively , one should take @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the dipole moment of the absorber ( amplifier ) @xcite . the branches of solutions of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqareatheorem ] ) in the amplifier and absorber are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr1]b . because of different dipole moments , these two branches are also different </S>",
    "<S> besides , as said , we reverse the sign of @xmath23 to `` mimic '' the change of sign of @xmath26 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqareatheorem ] ) . we choose the positive direction of motion in @xmath23 as the pulse propagates in the absorber ( blue curves noted as @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) , whereas for the amplifier the propagation direction is opposite ( red curve noted as @xmath29 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> using such diagram technique we are able to understand easily the details of the pulse area evolution . in our laser in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr1]a a short pulse passes through the amplifier , is reflected from the mirror @xmath30 with the reflection coefficient @xmath31 , and then enters the absorber . </S>",
    "<S> we assume for simplicity that the other mirrors do not produce any energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume that the pulse travels long enough in every cavity section such that both the gain and absorber are able to recover to their equilibrium values between the pulse passages . using the diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr1]b we are able to follow the evolution of the pulse area during one round - trip in the ring laser .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now suppose that a short pulse with the small initial area @xmath32 enters the gain section ( point @xmath30 on the red ( amplifier ) curve @xmath29 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the pulse propagates in the amplifier , the corresponding point on the diagram is moving from right to left along the amplifier branch to the point @xmath33 , which is accompanied by an increase of the pulse area as one can see from fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : mcallhahngr1]b . </S>",
    "<S> after the pulse passes the amplifier , it is reflected by a non - ideal mirror and its area is thus reduced , which corresponds to the moving the point on the diagram fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr1]b vertically from @xmath33 by some amount depending on @xmath31 . then , by moving along the straight line parallel to the horizontal axis one places the point to @xmath34 on the absorber branch , which now describes the pulse entering the absorber </S>",
    "<S> . evolution of the pulse in the absorber is described by moving from left to right along the blue branch until the point @xmath35 where the pulse leaves the absorber . </S>",
    "<S> now this point returns back to the gain branch at the point @xmath36 thus closing the propagation circle . </S>",
    "<S> it continues to move further to the point @xmath37 etc . </S>",
    "<S> using such an approach one can expect that after many round - trips a stable limit cycle appears . </S>",
    "<S> this cycle and its formation is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr1]c . to confirm the results of our qualitative analysis presented above we perform numerical simulations based on a set of maxwell - bloch equations describing propagation of light in a two - level medium in a slow - varying envelope approximation @xcite : @xmath38-f(z , t ) , \\label{eq : eqphochap2}\\\\   \\partial_t a(z , t ) + c\\partial_za(z </S>",
    "<S> , t)= \\kappa(z ) p_{s}(z , t ) , \\label{eq : eqacchap2}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the slowly varying envelope of imaginary part of non - diagonal element of the quantum mechanical density matrix of a two level particle , @xmath43 is the population difference between the lower and upper energy levels , @xmath44 is the slowly varying amplitude of the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the equations include parameters of the two - level particles , such as transition dipole moment @xmath45 , concentration of two - level particles @xmath46 , population difference relaxation time @xmath47 , polarization relaxation time @xmath48 and transition frequency of the two - level medium @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume that @xmath50 is a constant in every piece of the cavity defined , namely @xmath51 in the absorption medium and @xmath52 in the gain medium ( and analogously for @xmath53 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath49 , each of them obtains an index @xmath54 or @xmath55 in the corresponding medium ) . in particular , @xmath56 , @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the set of equations ( [ eq : eqpschap2])-([eq : eqacchap2 ] ) allows accurate modeling of evolution of extended two - level media in a cavity assuming relatively long ( up to 100 fs ) pulse durations and low intensities ( rabi frequency @xmath58 ) , so that no significant intracavity dispersion effects and no multilevel dynamics enter into play . </S>",
    "<S> the equations take also into account longitudinal multi - mode dynamics and the nonlinear coherent effects accompanying interaction of the light with the two - level particles . </S>",
    "<S> we use the system of equations ( [ eq : eqpschap2])-([eq : eqacchap2 ] ) to analyze the dynamics of the ring cml laser assuming the regime of unidirectional propagation far away from the single - cycle limit .    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr4]a shows the distribution of the electric field amplitude @xmath59 in the cavity over 100 round - trips in a steady - state when absorber / gain dipole moment ratio @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr3]b illustrates the dependence of the pulse area inside the cavity during a single pass . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly seen that , as it was predicted above , the pulse area is close to @xmath2 in the absorber and to @xmath3 in the gain . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkably that in the present case the pulse area decreased due to the reflection from the mirror is restored in the absorber . besides the pulse area in the amplifier changes nonmonotonically . in general </S>",
    "<S> however , </S>",
    "<S> the stable regime do establishes with the pulse area dynamics as predicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr1]c . </S>",
    "<S> it can be also seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr4]a that the pulse velocity in the absorber is smaller than in the amplifier , which manifests itself in a bend of the pulse propagation trajectory on the boundary between the absorber and amplifier . with the help of the diagrams introduced above </S>",
    "<S> we will extend our consideration to a more general situation when the ratio of the dipole moments is not equal to two . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider the case when @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding diagram for @xmath62 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr3]a . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the limit cycle is realized with the branch @xmath29 of the amplifier and @xmath27 of the absorber . on the amplifier branch , </S>",
    "<S> the pulse with the area tending to @xmath3 is formed , whereas the absorber decreases the pulse area almost to zero ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr4]d ) . because of the energy conservation , </S>",
    "<S> pulse envelope must change its sign ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr4]c ) , and hence , @xmath63 pulse is formed @xcite . in the example presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr3]b , in contrast , we set @xmath64 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the branch @xmath29 of amplifier and one of the branches @xmath27 or @xmath28 of the absorber can take part in the generation . in both of these possibilities </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics in the amplifier section is similar whereas in the absorber the pulse duration can increase ( branch 2a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the situation when @xmath65 is further increased and achieves @xmath66 , namely , @xmath67 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr3]c . </S>",
    "<S> one branch of the amplifier @xmath29 and one of the three branches of the absorber @xmath27 , @xmath28 or @xmath68 will be involved in this case . </S>",
    "<S> the cycle formed on the branch @xmath68 yields a reduction of the pulse duration , because the pulse just before the absorber has the area @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the ratio of the dipole moments influences the pulse duration and its dynamics in the cml cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of the pulse duration with the increase of @xmath65 was predicted theoretically in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in the situation when @xmath70 the branch @xmath71 and @xmath29 can participate in generation ( fig .  [ fig : mcallhahngr3]d ) . on this branch , </S>",
    "<S> the formation of @xmath72-pulses takes place , which are , however , as our simulations show ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcallhahngr4]e , f ) , split into two @xmath2 pulses having typically different amplitudes and durations . </S>",
    "<S> that is , two pulses over a single cavity round - trip arise . </S>",
    "<S> the physical reason of this splitting can be easily understood from the fact that each @xmath2 `` part '' causes excitation and de - excitation of the medium . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the central part of the pulse is continuously interacting with the particles which have returned to the ground state and hence is gradually `` eaten '' @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> note , that in numerical simulations we used parameters typical for quantum dots ( qds ) ( relaxations times , dipole moments etc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that semiconductor qds seems to be appropriate candidates for experimental observation of cml regime because of large values of dipole moments as well as large low - temperature relaxation times @xmath0 ( in excess of 500 ps ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the diagrams presented above allow to calculate some characteristics of the pulse analytically . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the pulse area at some point ( for instance , just at the entrance the gain section ) @xmath73 at the step @xmath74 can easily related to @xmath75 as @xmath76 , @xmath77,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 , @xmath79 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this expression allows to consider the mode - locking regime as a fixed point of the mapping @xmath80 which is stable if @xmath81 .    </S>",
    "<S> although in general @xmath80 ( and thus @xmath82 ) can be calculated only numerically , analytical results can be obtained assuming small deviation of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath31 from one ( as it is usually happens in a typical laser ) . in this case , we denote @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and assume @xmath88 , @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> we also must select the branches of @xmath90 and @xmath91 which make @xmath80 continuous in the vicinity of the fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , near non - lasing point @xmath92 we obtain ( by taking derivative of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) and expanding into series in @xmath93 ) : @xmath94 where @xmath95 means the higher order terms in @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , in the linear approximation , the expression for @xmath96 reproduces the loss - gain balance in the system . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for a cml regime with @xmath97 we may assume the fixed point is close to 2@xmath3 , that is , @xmath98 , @xmath99 which , by substitution into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) , allows us to obtain in the lowest order : @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> this expression can be singular , indicating that for @xmath101 and @xmath102 the fixed point near @xmath103 disappears . to ensure @xmath99 a regularizing expansion is needed . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we may introduce the parameter @xmath104 such that @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 ; @xmath108 . with this expansion </S>",
    "<S> we obtain : @xmath109 which , in turn , gives us : @xmath110 that is , because @xmath111 , the cml regime is always stable in the lowest order ( assuming it exists and @xmath99 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this point is becoming the only attracting one if the nonlasing state is unstable , thus giving rise to cml directly at threshold . </S>",
    "<S> although the stability of the corresponding cycle does not automatically ensures the stability of the fundamental mode - locking regime because instability at nonzero wavenumber can arise , we can often take the cavity short enough to suppress such instabilities as was shown in @xcite . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we developed a diagram technique , allowing to study the cml regimes qualitatively , and demonstrated existence of stable limit cycles in the system , corresponding to cml regimes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our results show that such regimes can appear directly at the laser threshold . although the area theorem is applicable for the case of large @xmath0 , practically `` large '' means only that @xmath112 the round - trip time . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations show also that the predictions of the theory are valid even if these times are comparable ( but still @xmath0 is not too small ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also extended the cml to the case when @xmath65 , the ratio of the transition dipole moments of the absorber and the gain media is arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previously considered @xmath2 configurations , in this case , @xmath63 pulses as well as @xmath4 pulses can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the later can be called super - cml because more than one rabi oscillation per cavity round - trip appears . </S>",
    "<S> such @xmath4 pulses are however unstable and split into @xmath113 sub - pulses , each of them having area @xmath2 . although cml has not been realized experimentally yet , the most of the basic aspects of sit including the area theorem were verified experimentally @xcite ; in particular , coherent phenomena were recently observed in quantum dots @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we hope that the present letter will facilitate further efforts on its experimental realization . </S>"
