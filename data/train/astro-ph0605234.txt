    "t  tauri stars ( tts ) are young ( @xmath3 , @xcite ) low - mass objects , and are the progenitors of solar - type stars .",
    "classical t  tauri stars ( ctts ) exhibit strong h@xmath0 emission , and typically have spectral types of f  k .",
    "some of the most active ctts show emission in higher balmer lines and metal lines ( e.g. , ca@xmath4  h and k ) .",
    "they also exhibit excess continuum flux in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) .",
    "their spectral energy distribution and polarisation data suggest the presence of circumstellar discs , which play an important role in regulating dynamics of gas flows around ctts ( e.g. @xcite ) .    many observational studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) of ctts line profiles have revealed evidence for both outward wind flows and inward accretion flows , characterised by the blue - shifted absorption features in h@xmath0 profiles and redshifted inverse p  cygni ( ipc ) profiles respectively .",
    "typical mass - loss rates of ctts are about @xmath5 to @xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the mass - accretion rates are also about @xmath5 to @xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent h@xmath0 spectro - astrometric observations by @xcite provide indirect evidence for the presence of bipolar and monopolar outflows down to @xmath7 scale ( e.g.cs  cha and ru  lup ) .",
    "similarly , eso vlt observations using high - resolution ( @xmath8 ) two - dimensional spectra of edge - on ctts ( hh  30 , hk  tau  b , and hv  tau  c ) by @xcite show extended h@xmath0 emission in the direction perpendicular to the obscuring circumstellar disc , suggesting the presence of the bipolar outflows . on an even larger scale , _ hst _ observations of hh30 @xcite",
    "trace the jet to within @xmath9  au of the star .",
    "the jet has a cone shape with an opening angle of @xmath10 between 70 and 700 au @xcite .",
    "@xcite found about 80 per cent of their sample ( 30 ctts ) show blue - shifted absorption components in at least one of the balmer lines and na  d.    in the currently favoured model of accretion in ctts , the accretion disc is disrupted by the magnetosphere , which channels the gas from the disc onto the stellar surface ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this picture is supported by recent measurements of strong ( @xmath11 ) magnetic fields in ctts ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and by radiative transfer models which reproduce the gross characteristics of observed profiles for some ctts ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular the magnetospheric accretion ( ma ) model explains blue - ward asymmetric emission line profiles as resulting from the partial occultation of the flow by the stellar photosphere and by the inner part of the accretion disc , while inverse p  cygni profiles in the ma model result from inflowing material at near free - fall velocities seen projected against hotspots on the stellar surface .    despite these successes ,",
    "the overwhelming observational evidence for outflows in ctts suggests that the ma model is only one component of a complex circumstellar environment .",
    "clearly , one must include the contribution of any wind / jet flow if one wishes to both accurately predict the mass - accretion rate and also determine the mass - loss rate of a ctts via emission profile modelling . the first attempt in this direction",
    "was made by @xcite who demonstrated that the observed h@xmath0 , h@xmath12 and na  d lines of rw  aur are better reproduced by the radiative transfer model which included a collimated disc - wind arising from near the inner edge of the accretion disc .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to find a simple kinematic model which can reproduce the wide variety of the observed profiles , and to perform empirical studies of line formation in an attempt to place morphological classification schemes on a firmer physical footing",
    ". we will also discuss whether our model is consistent with some predictions made by recent ( magneto - hydrodynamics ) mhd studies i.e.   @xmath13 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in section",
    "[ sec : model - configuration ] , the model assumptions and the basic model configurations are presented .",

    "we discuss our results in the context of reipurth s classification scheme in section  [ sec : discussion ] , and our summary and conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in order to understand how the different parts of the ctts circumstellar environment contribute to the formation of h@xmath0 , the model space is divided into four different regions : ( 1 )  a central continuum source , ( 2 )  the magnetospheric accretion flow , ( 3 )  the wind outflow , and ( 4 )  the accretion disc .",
    "[ fig : config_discwind ] depicts the relative location of the regions in the model space .",
    "the density is assumed to be rotationally symmetric around the @xmath14-axis .",
    "the innermost radius of the magnetosphere at the equatorial plane coincides with the the inner radius of the accretion disc . from the innermost part of the accretion disc ,",
    "the gas falls freely , moving along the magnetic field onto the surface of the star . in the following subsections",
    "we describe the details of the model components .",
    "we adopt stellar parameters of a typical classical t  tauri star for the central continuum source , i.e. radius ( @xmath15 ) , mass ( @xmath16 ) , and effective temperature of the photosphere ( @xmath17 ) are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "the model atmosphere of @xcite with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( cgs ) defines the photospheric contribution to the continuum flux .",
    "the parameters are summarised in table  [ tab : std_parameters ] .",
    "an additional continuum source is considered for models which include magnetospheric accretion : as the infalling gas approaches the stellar surface , it decelerates in a strong shock , and is heated to @xmath23 . the x - ray radiation produced in the shock",
    "will be absorbed by the gas locally , and re - emitted as optical and uv light ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this will create hot rings where the magnetic field intersects with the surface .",
    "we assume that the free - falling kinetic energy is thermalized in the radiating layer , and is re - emitted as blackbody radiation with a single temperature . with the parameters of the magnetosphere and the star given above ( table  [ tab : std_parameters ] ) , about @xmath24  per  cent of the surface",
    "is covered by the hot rings . in our model ,",
    "the fraction of hot - ring coverage area is determined only by the geometry of the magnetosphere ( section  [ sub : magnetosphere ] ) .",
    "@xcite estimated the fractions of the hot - ring coverage area for three intermediate ctts by using the observed uv and optical spectra .",
    "they found the range of fraction to be 0.33.0  per  cent .",
    "this is smaller than the value adopted here ; however , even if we use 1  per  cent hot - ring area coverage model ( by changing the width of the magnetosphere ) , we find the line shapes of h@xmath0 do not change significantly ( see also fig .  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "if the mass - accretion rate is @xmath25 , the ratio of the accretion luminosity to the photospheric luminosity is about @xmath26 , and the corresponding temperature of the hot rings is about @xmath27 .",
    "the luminosity ratio and the temperature depend on an adopted mass - accretion rate .",
    "the continuum emission from the hot rings is taken into account when computing the line profiles .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     recently , @xcite have shown that the ew of the observed h@xmath0 from ctts is inclination dependent , with the ew increasing as the inclination angle increases . next , we will examine whether the hybrid model is consistent with the inclination dependency found in the observation .",
    "the left - hand panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : effect_inclination_compare ] shows the profiles computed with the disc - wind , magnetosphere hybrid model ( section  [ sub : result - discwind - knigge ] ) at inclination angles @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the magnetospheric accretion component uses the parameters used as the reference model ( table  [ tab : std_parameters ] ) .",
    "the figure shows that the absorption feature becomes stronger as the inclination increases , mainly because of the geometrical configuration .",
    "the optical depth to the observer becomes larger as the inclination angle increases , since the density of the disc wind increases towards the equatorial plane  as a result , the ew becomes smaller as the inclination angle increases : 41 , 27 , and 19 for @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "this is a robust result , and is insensitive to the adopted wind parameters . recall that this is the same ew / inclination dependency as the magnetosphere only models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : acc_inclination_effect ] ) .",
    "clearly the inclination dependency of the line strength is in contradiction with the @xcite result , and thus merits further investigation . in the previous sections",
    ", we have considered h@xmath0 line formation in a disc wind , which mimics the density distribution of the magneto - centrifugal launched jet models ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the density in this model is more concentrated toward the equatorial plane in the region where the line emissivity is highest , although further out the material becomes collimated into a bipolar jet , this would not contribute significantly to the line emission in our models .    as an alternative",
    ", we consider a wind model in which the outflow density increases towards the pole , rather than the equator . in this model ,",
    "the disc - wind is replaced by a stellar wind , propagating only in the radial direction , accelerating under the classical beta - velocity law ( c.f .",
    "* ) i.e. @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath15 are the wind terminal velocity and the stellar radius respectively .",
    "@xmath12 is the wind acceleration parameter similar to the one seen in the disc - wind model ( c.f",
    ".  equation  [ eq : discwind - poloidal - velocity ] ) .",
    "the wind emerges from the stellar surface , but restricted to be within @xmath36 from the symmetry axis hence forming the cone - shaped regions both above and below the poles .",
    "the density is computed from assuming a constant mass - loss rate per unit area over the stellar surface , requiring mass - flux conservation , and using the beta velocity law above .",
    "the schematic of the model configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : config_stellarwind ] . again",
    ", we assume the wind temperature ( @xmath37 ) is isothermal for simplicity .",
    "this model configuration is motivated by the recent study by @xcite who demonstrated that a stellar wind along open magnetic field lines originating from the star may cause significant spin - down torque .",
    "the right - hand panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : effect_inclination_compare ] shows h@xmath0 profiles computed using the alternative model at the same inclination angles used for the disc - wind - magnetosphere hybrid model .",
    "the mass - loss rate of the stellar wind in this model is @xmath38 , which is the same as the mass - loss rate used in the disc - wind magnetosphere hybrid model in the same figure . in both models ,",
    "the mass - accretion rate of @xmath39 is used .",
    "the wind acceleration parameter ( @xmath12 ) and the wind temperature ( @xmath37 ) used here are @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "all the other parameters are the same as in the disc - wind magnetosphere model . with this set of @xmath12 and @xmath37 ,",
    "the wind emission is significantly larger than the emission from the magnetosphere .",
    "because of the geometry of the wind , the p - cygni absorption feature weakens as the inclination increases : the optical depth of the wind is much higher in the polar direction . for the same reason , the ew of the line increases as the inclination increases , as clearly seen in the figure .",
    "specifically the values are 54 , 69 , and 98 for @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "this inclination dependency of ew is seen in the models with wide ranges of @xmath12 and @xmath37 , provided that the wind emission of the model is dominating the emission from magnetosphere .",
    "a similar inclination dependency of ew is found for lower wind mass - loss rate models ( e.g.  @xmath42 ) while keeping @xmath1 .",
    "the @xcite study used just 12 objects , and a significantly greater sample should be investigated before firm conclusions are drawn . however",
    "our models indicate a significant difference in the inclination dependence of the line morphology which may be simply tested against observation .",
    "for example , one possible way to distinguish the two different wind models is to examine the profile shape of a ctts which is known to be viewed close to pole - on ( e.g. a ctts with a very low @xmath43 ) .",
    "if the profile contains a prominent blue - shifted absorption component ( e.g. type iv - b ) , the system is more likely to be associated with the bipolar stellar wind type of outflow , and not with the disc - wind . in reality",
    ", however , the two types of winds may be present in the same object , in a similar fashion to that seen in the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in these models , the fast stellar wind is present in the polar directions , while at the same time a slower , denser disc - wind is present near the equatorial plane .",
    "we have presented disc - wind - magnetosphere hybrid radiative transfer models for classical t  tauri stars , and detailed studies of the h@xmath0 formation from their complex circumstellar environment .",
    "we found that the hybrid model can reproduce the wide variety of profile seen in observations ( figures  [ fig : atlas_acc_models ] , [ fig : atlas_discwind_only ] , [ fig : atlas_hybrid ] and [ fig : atlas_reipurth ] ) .    using the model results , we examined the h@xmath0 spectroscopic classification proposed by @xcite , and discussed the basic physical conditions that reproduce the profiles in each classified type ( section  [ sub : classification - scheme - proposed ] ) . using the different combinations of the inclination ( @xmath44 ) ,",
    "the mass - loss to mass - accretion rate ratio ( @xmath45 ) and the wind acceleration rate ( @xmath12 ) , our radiative transfer model was able to produce all 7 classes of profiles defined in @xcite .",
    "one potential free parameter of our models is the ratio of mass - loss rate to mass - accretion rate ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "most mhd simulations predict a value of @xmath46 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , and we have adopted this figure for most of our models .",
    "the success of our profile in matching observations is therefore encouraging , and provides support for this canonical value of @xmath45 .",
    "we have computed sample models with other values of @xmath45 , ( fig .",
    "[ fig : discwind_mu_effect ] ) and find that models with @xmath47 are still consistent with observations .",
    "wind - only or magnetosphere - only models may be representative of individual line profiles , but neither can explain the complete reipurth classification scheme  even magnetosphere dominated profiles ( type  i ) can be readily explained by the hybrid model with @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , the dependency of the line equivalent width on the inclination angle predicted by the disc - wind - magnetosphere hybrid model does not agree with the trend seen the observations of @xcite .",
    "we may appeal to the small sample size of their study ( 12 objects ) to question the validity of the ew effect , but we have also considered an alternative model in which the disc - wind is replaced by a biconical stellar wind , and have found that this alternative wind model can reproduce the line equivalent width dependency on the inclination ( fig .",
    "[ fig : effect_inclination_compare ] ) .",
    "however , mhd simulations predict that bipolar or jet - like flows in ctts are always accompanied by a disc - wind originating near the star : the actual situation therefore is likely to be a combination of the two flows .",
    "although we have concentrated on ctts here , the hybrid model is equally applicable to pre - main - sequence stars across the mass spectrum .",
    "herbig ae / be star profiles are equally diverse , and whilst many of the profiles are indicative of a wind ( @xcite ) some lines may be explained by magnetospheric accretion alone ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one possible advantage in applying the hybrid model to the herbig ae / be systems is the growing observational data probing the line formation region and inner disc using techniques such as spectro - astrometry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , spectropolarimetry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and interferometry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these high - resolution techniques may aid model fitting of individual objects by constraining some of the model parameters , in particular the inclination .",
    "velocity broadened , asymmetric h@xmath0 profiles in brown dwarfs ( bds ) are used as an indicator of ongoing magnetospheric accretion , and the same models that are used for ctts are applied to these systems in order to determine mass - accretion rates ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the line profiles however display the same wide variety of morphologies as the ctts and herbig ae / be stars ( although we note as yet no bd profile has been observed with red - shifted absorption ) .",
    "it is natural to assume that the same physics applies in these low mass objects , and that a hybrid model may be more successful in fitting these profiles , and will give greater insight into the circumstellar kinematics .",
    "there are several avenues of future work to consider . here",
    "we have adopted a simple analytical form for the accretion and outflow velocity and density structure .",
    "a more self - consistent approach would be to use the results of mhd simulations as an input to the radiative - transfer modelling .",
    "the thermodynamics of the circumstellar gas needs to be examined ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) and also computed self - consistently with the radiation field used in the radiative - transfer , a process that would decrease the free parameters of the model .",
    "we intend to calculate other observables from the model that may be compared with observation and should provide further constraints .",
    "the line polarisation signature , which arises from scattering of line and continuum photons in the circumstellar dust , encodes both dynamical and geometric information , such as the size of the inner disk radius ( e.g.  @xcite : @xcite ) .",
    "spectro - astrometry may provide information on the system s inclination , and the geometry of the outflow on large scales ( e.g.  @xcite : @xcite ) .",
    "interferometry also provides information on inner disc radii and inclinations , although currently only for the herbig ae / be stars .",
    "we have concentrated on the formation of the h@xmath0 line , because it is the best studied ctts emission line .",
    "however it is clear that simultaneous fitting of several emission line profiles should provide much stronger constraints .",
    "in particular it appears that the near - ir hydrogen lines ( pa@xmath12 and br@xmath48 ) are less affected by outflows than h@xmath0 .",
    "one could therefore use these lines to constrain the mass - accretion rate , and use h@xmath0 to obtain the mass - loss rate .",
    "a potential pitfall is the significant temporal variability that all ctts show in their emission lines ; the observational data on a particular object must be co - temporaneous .",

    "<S> the wide variety of line profiles seen in observations are indicative of both inflow and outflow , and we therefore employ a circumstellar structure that includes both magnetospheric accretion and a disc wind . we perform systematic investigations of the model parameters for the wind and the magnetosphere to search for possible geometrical and physical conditions which lead to the types of profiles seen in observations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the hybrid models can reproduce the wide range of profile types seen in observations , and that the most common profile types observed occupy a large volume of parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , the most infrequently observed profile morphologies require a very specific set of models parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find our model profiles are consistent with the canonical value of the mass - loss rate to mass - accretion rate ratio ( @xmath1 ) found in earlier magneto - hydrodynamic calculations and observations , but the models with @xmath2 are still in accord with observed h@xmath0 profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the wind contribution to the line profile as a function of model parameters , and examine the reliability of h@xmath0 as a mass accretion diagnostic . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we examine the h@xmath0 spectroscopic classification used by reipurth et .  </S>",
