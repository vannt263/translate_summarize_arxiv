    "one explanation for the observed flat distribution within cluster cores could be that the transformation mechanisms at work are the cluster - specific ones ( ram - pressure stripping and tidal disruption caused by the cluster potential ,  [ sec : intro ] ) which do not depend directly on local galaxy density .",
    "this explanation , however , can not account for the pronounced t-@xmath3 relation detected in our study once the survey area is enlarged to include the cluster outskirts .",
    "the efficiency of galaxy mergers and harassment , on the other hand , increases with galaxy density and decreases with relative velocity ; hence , galaxy - galaxy interactions are highly implausible causes of morphological transformation in the very cores of clusters .",
    "by contrast , the efficiency of moderate - velocity galaxy - galaxy encounters for morphological transformation is evidenced by many studies of galaxy evolution in intermediate - density environment @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xcite demonstrates that suitable environments include the outskirts of clusters . as shown in bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ galxdensity_in ] this is indeed the environment that contributes the bulk of the observed t-@xmath3 correlation .    a correlation between morphological fractions and local galaxy density",
    "could , however , still be expected in environments between the aforementioned extremes , i.e. , closer to the cluster center but far enough from the very core for relative galaxy velocities to be low enough to be conducive to merging and harassment @xcite .",
    "no convincing correlation of this kind is , however , present in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ galxdensity_in ] .",
    "we propose an explanation for this observation in the following paragraph .    for the purposes of the following argument we separate the lenticular galaxies found in clusters at moderate to high redshift into two populations , but note that this distinction need not imply different physical origins . at and beyond the outskirts of clusters ,",
    "galaxies transformed as the result of galaxy - galaxy interactions at low relative velocity dominate the s0 population , and hence their numbers correlate with local galaxy density .",
    "lenticular galaxies found in the cores of clusters , however , were largely accreted from the low - density environment at larger cluster - centric distances where they formed . this cluster - core population does not exhibit a correlation of the s0 fraction with local galaxy density because we observe and recognize these galaxies as lenticulars only after the morphological transformation has been largely completed .",
    "this process takes of the order of a few gyr @xcite , which is larger than the cluster crossing time .",
    "hence the location of these members of the second population of s0s is not representative of the environment that initially triggered their morphological transformation and no t-@xmath3 correlation is observed .    in the local universe",
    "this picture is slightly altered , as the cluster lenticulars created in the processes discussed above will have settled into virial equilibrium , meaning their spatial distribution will now trace the gravitational potential of the cluster . intriguingly ,",
    "a direct consequence of this argument is that the t-@xmath3 relation observed for s0s in local clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) does not establish a causal link between these two quantities , but is mainly the result if a fortuitous mix of a population that traces the cluster potential ( ellipticals and old lenticulars ) with a second population that does not ( newly created s0s and spirals still being accreted from the field ) .",
    "for elliptical galaxies which may have been created as early as @xmath72 @xcite the same argument holds also for clusters out to @xmath73 , i.e. , even at moderate to high redshift the observed pronounced t-@xmath3 correlation tells us little about the cause of the morphological transformation from late- to early - type galaxies .",
    "finally , we emphasize that we do not suggest that the t-@xmath3 relation of s0s in the local universe in general is unrelated to the density dependence of the morphological transformation of galaxies  it is only in clusters that much of the observed correlation is likely to be spurious . in the low- to intermediate - density regime ,",
    "this relation still constitutes one of the most convincing pieces of evidence of density - dependent galaxy evolution .",
    "however , when interpreting this relation in cluster cores we need to bear in mind that the galaxy density at the observed location of an s0 is not indicative of the density of the environment within which the morphological transformation originated .",
    "= 0.45 = 0.45    our discovery of a significant t-@xmath3 correlation in this study demonstrates that the large - scale environment of macsj0717 is conducive to the creation of lenticular galaxies via galaxy - galaxy interactions already at @xmath74 , which leaves us with a conundrum . the fact that no significant evolution in the fraction of any morphological galaxy type is observed at @xmath75 would only be understandable , if the physical mechanisms discussed in  [ sec : intro ] were not efficient at intermediate to high redshift .",
    "our finding , however , shows that at least mergers , and possibly also harassment , are at work , a result that does not come unexpected in view of the fact that the galaxy environment at @xmath76 is not dramatically different from the one encountered at , e.g. , @xmath77 .",
    "why then , does the global fraction of lenticular galaxies remain constant all the way from @xmath78 to @xmath73 ?",
    "a partial answer may be provided by a hypothesis advanced by @xcite who argue that a significant fraction of s0s forms so early that it can not be explained by the transformation of infalling late - type galaxies .",
    "while this argument may explain why the global fraction of s0s does not decrease to essentially zero at high redshift , it fails to account for the absence of any apparent evolution at @xmath75 .",
    "future large - scale studies of massive galaxy clusters at @xmath79 may provide the best statistics to accurately establish both the redshift at which the t-@xmath3 correlation finally disappears and the global morphological fraction of s0s which continue to play a pivotal role in our understanding of galaxy evolution .",
