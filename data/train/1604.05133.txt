    "any quantum system inevitably interacts with its surroundings which possess a huge amount of uncontrollable degrees of freedom .",
    "such interaction causes the rapid destruction of quantum coherence , which is an essential requirement for quantum information processing to fully exploit the new possibilities opened by quantum mechanics . for example , the information stored in two - level systems ( we refer to atoms hereafter ) can be destroyed by their surrounding electromagnetic field .",
    "spontaneous emission ( se ) is one of the most prominent effects in the interaction of atoms with vacuum .",
    "it is an atomic radiation as follow : an atom initially in an excited state relax to its ground state and emit a quanta of energy to its surrounding vacuum electromagnetic ( em ) field , which carries away the difference in energy between the two levels .",
    "se is not only useless but also harmful to quantum information process .",
    "however , recently studies have shown that it is useful to build a device in a quantum network for controlling single photons by a local atom , e.g. the atomic radiation leads to the total reflection of the single - photon propagating in one quantum channel  @xcite , the frequency converter for single photons  @xcite , and the transfer of single photons from one quantum channel to the other  @xcite .",
    "nowadays , great interest has been paid on the use of atoms to act as a quantum node in extended communication networks and scalable computational devices  zlzeno , zheng , roy , zlmzi , gongpra78,lawpra78,spt13,zlqrouter2,prl116,attenuator , mtcheng , longo , alexanian , tshisun .",
    "as the se rate of a single atom can be modified by a succession of short and strong pulses or measure to the quantum system , a dynamical quantum - zeno - effect(qze ) switch for single photons is proposed  @xcite .",
    "the quantum interference between multiple transition pathways of atomic internal states has been exploited to modify the transport property of the single photons in a quantum channel  @xcite . with the well - known result that the atomic se depends on the electromagnetic vacuum environment that the atom is subjected to ,",
    "a boundary has been used to increase the efficiency of the quantum router  @xcite .",
    "actually , the se rate of a single atom is one of the basic topic of quantum electrodynamics , numerous studies of the se rates  @xcite have been carried out for atoms in free space  ( e.g.@xcite ) , in a cavity  ( e.g. @xcite ) , near a metallic mirror  ( e.g. pra35 - 5081 ) or a dielectric interfacer  ( e.g. @xcite ) , between two mirrors  ( e.g. @xcite ) or two dielectric interfaces  ( e.g. pra57 - 3913 ) .",
    "however , photons used to transmit information or distribute the entanglement along the network , are confined in a one dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide .",
    "similar to cavities , 1d waveguide has a well - defined mode spectrum and a relatively loss - free environment .",
    "however , unlike cavities , modes are available in waveguide for photons to propagate .",
    "the geometry constraint not only confines the propagating direction of photon , but also gives rise to an increasing of the interference effects . since photons",
    "do not interact with each other , atoms implanted in waveguide are necessary to mediate the photon - photon interaction or redirect the possible propagating directions .",
    "the coupling strength of atoms to the waveguide is enhanced by decreasing the mode volume .",
    "consequently , the atomic radiation in 1d waveguide plays an important role in controlling photons in quantum networks . and the studies on the atoms in 1d waveguide",
    "is now referred to by the term `` waveguide quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . ''",
    "since the radiative properties of an atom in a confined space differ fundamentally from that in free space , considerable interest has been paid on atoms in a semi - infinite or infinite 1d waveguide .",

    "in this paper , we study the radiative properties of an atom in a semi - infinite waveguide of rectangular cross section , which is a typical 1d qed system .",
    "the termination of the waveguide is regarded as a perfect mirror , which reflects emitted photons back to the atom .",
    "we analyze the interaction of an initially excited two - level atom with the waveguide in vacuum .",
    "the markovian approximation is first used to analyze the dependence of the se rate on the density of states and the spatial profile of the waveguide . to find the influence of the time that one - photon wave packet requires to bounce back and forth between the atom and the mirror , we perform the linear expansion of the dispersion relation for the atomic transition frequency far away from the cutoff frequencies , and obtain a delay - differential equation",

    "<S> we study a quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) system made of an two - level atom and a semi - infinite rectangular waveguide , which behaves as a perfect mirror in one end . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial dependence of the atomic spontaneous emission has been included in the coupling strength relevant to the eigenmodes of the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the role of retardation is studied for the atomic transition frequency far away from the cutoff frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the atom - mirror distance introduces different phases and retardation times into the dynamics of the atom interacting resonantly with the corresponding transverse modes . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the upper state population decreases from its initial as long as the atom - mirror distance does not vanish , and is lowered and lowered when more and more transverse modes are resonant with the atom . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic spontaneous emission can be either suppressed or enhanced by adjusting the atomic location for short retardation time . </S>",
    "<S> there are partial revivals and collapses due to the photon reabsorbed and re - emitted by the atom for long retardation time . </S>"
