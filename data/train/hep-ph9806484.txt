    "[ introduction ] prompt - photon production plays a very important role in our understanding of the physics of hadron collisions . at the leading order ( lo ) in qcd perturbation theory ,",
    "prompt photons are produced via light - quark annihilation , with emission of a hard gluon recoiling against the photon , or via quark - gluon compton scattering , with the emission of a quark .",
    "when the compton process dominates the cross section , tests or even measurements of the gluon density inside the proton can be performed .",
    "this is the case of photon production at small @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) in @xmath4 collisions , and it is true for all values of @xmath0 that are accessible in fixed - target proton - nucleon collisions , due to smaller content of antiquarks relative to gluons in the nucleon sea . in particular , prompt - photon production at large @xmath0 can therefore be used to constrain or measure the gluon density at large @xmath1 .",
    "this region of the gluon density is of great importance for the study of high - transverse - momentum phenomena at hadron colliders , and it is not accessible using only deep - inelastic - scattering ( dis ) data .    the cross section for inclusive photon production has been computed at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in perturbation theory @xcite@xcite . the nlo computation of _ isolated _ photon production  @xcite@xcite , which is the relevant quantity for the measurements carried out in high - energy @xmath4 collisions , is also available in the limit of small size of the isolation cone  @xcite@xcite .",
    "these calculations include all light - parton fragmentation processes up to nlo  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical results have been used  @xcite@xcite to probe the overall consistency of the prompt - photon production data from both fixed - target  @xcite@xcite and collider experiments  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the data has not provided so far a fully satisfactory picture .",
    "the study by huston et al .",
    "@xcite exposed a tendency of the @xmath0 distributions to be steeper than theory , regardless of the value of @xmath5 .",
    "this result could not be accomodated by a simple modification of the parton densities , since different experiments probe different values of @xmath0 .",
    "these authors therefore proposed that additional mechanisms should be introduced to explain the pattern of the data . in the fixed - target regime , such a mechanism would be provided by the presence of a non - perturbative @xmath6 kick , which would smear the @xmath7 spectra .",
    "this phenomenon was also advocated to help explain the spectra of fixed - target heavy - quark production  @xcite . in the high - energy regime ,",
    "probed by the tevatron experiments , the @xmath7 smearing necessary to reconcile theory and data could be provided by the inclusion of multi - gluon emission effects from the evolution of the initial state , as advocated by baer and reno  @xcite .",
    "the analysis by vogelsang and vogt  @xcite indicated that allowing for different choices of factorization and renormalization scales , a satisfactory fit to the data could be accomodated by modifying the gluon density within the range allowed by the dis data available in 1995 .",
    "this interpretation is apparently not viable anymore  @xcite , because of the most recent constraints on the gluon density extracted at small @xmath1 from the hera data , and , in particular , because of the latest fixed - target prompt - photon data from e706  @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the e706 data with nlo qcd , carried out in  @xcite , seems to confirm the need for an intrinsic-@xmath6 smearing corresponding to @xmath8  gev .",
    "these conclusions are shared in a recent global fit of the parton densities performed by the mrst group  @xcite . in this same study ( see also @xcite ) , however , a strong dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath5 is claimed to be necessary to properly describe the lower - energy data published by wa70 .    in conclusion , the comparison of the large-@xmath0 fixed - target data with nlo qcd still presents some puzzling features , which will need to be properly clarified before use of these data can be made to place robust constraints on the large-@xmath1 gluon distribution inside the proton .",
    "this is unfortunate , since these data provide today the only independent probe on high-@xmath1 gluons .",
    "their accurate interpretation is therefore a fundamental ingredient for an accurate prediction of the production rate of high-@xmath7 jets at the tevatron , a measurement which has challenged perturbative qcd in the recent past  @xcite .    to improve the reliability of the perturbative predictions for the production of prompt photons at large @xmath0 , and detect the presence of potentially large corrections beyond nlo that could change the interpretation of the current data , in the present work we consider an extension of the nlo formalism that includes large logarithmically - enhanced effects as the production threshold",
    "is approached .",
    "this is the kinematical region of interest for the fixed - target data . as the @xmath0 of the photon",
    "is increased , the parton luminosity becomes steeper , being driven down by the strong suppression of the gluon density at large @xmath1 .",
    "we thus enter a regime of inhibited radiation : further radiation of soft gluons is strongly suppressed , and logarithmically - enhanced effects ( sudakov effects ) arise at any order in the perturbative expansion .",
    "these logarithms spoil the reliability of the fixed - order expansion in the strong coupling @xmath10 and , hence , their summation to all pertubative orders is necessary . for simplicity , this regime can be described in terms of the distance from the kinematic threshold , which is reached when @xmath11 . in this limit ,",
    "the coefficients of the perturbative series for the cross section are enhanced by powers of @xmath12 that have to be resummed at all orders .",
    "this simplified description applies to the case of hypothetical structure functions that are not strongly suppressed at high @xmath1 .",
    "it is , however , an appropriate framework for the classification of the perturbative corrections we are interested in .    in this work",
    "we will present all the formalism that is needed to compute the resummed cross section for direct photons , integrated over the photon rapidity and at fixed transverse energy .",
    "in particular , we give explicit resummation formulae that are valid up to next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy .",
    "no phenomenological applications will be discussed here , but they will be explored in a forthcoming work . furthermore , the formulae for the resummed correction factors will be presented and illustrated , but not derived here .",
    "the general formalism  @xcite used to obtain the resummation factors , which has already been used for the nll resummation of the heavy - quark total production cross - section in ref .",
    "@xcite , will be presented in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "the rest of this work is organised as follows .",

    "the nll resummation factors are presented in sects .",
    "4.1 , 4.2 . in sect .",
    "4.3 , the fixed - order expansion of the resummed formulae is compared with the nlo results of refs .",
    "this comparison is also exploited to fix certain constant factors in the resummed formulae . in sect .",
    "5 we discuss similarities and differences between the resummed factors for the prompt - photon cross section and those for other hard - scattering processes , and we prove the consistency of the results obtained in the case of prompt photons with the coherence properties of large - angle soft - gluon emission . section  6 contains our conclusions .",
    "more technical details are left to the appendices . in appendix  a , we give the nll formulae for the radiative factors in the mellin transform representation .",
    "previous experience in the case of heavy - flavour production has shown that this is what is needed to perform a reliable phenomenological analysis @xcite . in appendix",
    "b , the threshold limit of the partonic cross sections is discussed . in particular ,",
    "a prediction for the logarithmic terms at the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) is given .",
    "finally , in appendix  c the simpler case of photoproduction of direct photons is discussed .",
    "while completing this paper , a study of the nll resummation for single - inclusive distributions , covering the case of prompt - photon production , has been released by laenen , oderda and sterman  @xcite .",
    "the presence of large logarithmically - enhanced contributions is a common feature in the study of the production cross sections of systems of high mass or high transverse energy near threshold . in this kinematic regime ,",
    "known as the sudakov regime , only additional soft gluons can be produced .",
    "the radiative tail of the real emission is thus strongly suppressed and can not balance the virtual corrections .",
    "the imperfect compensation between real and virtual terms leads to the large logarithmic contributions .",
    "general techniques for resumming soft - gluon corrections to hadroproduction processes have been developed over the past several years , starting from the case of drell - yan ( dy ) pair production  @xcite .",
    "the resummation program of the soft - gluon contributions is best carried out in the mellin - transform space , or @xmath13-space , where @xmath13 denotes the parameter that is conjugate to the kinematic variable that measures the distance from threshold . in @xmath13-moment space",

    "then , the exponentiation in eq .",

    "the qcd exponentiation formula for the dy process formally resembles analogous results for qed .",
    "this is because the underlying hard - scattering subprocess involves only _ two _ qcd partons , i.e. the annihilating @xmath31 pair , and , hence , both its kinematics and its colour structure are simple . in the case of prompt - photon production , instead , all the lo hard - scattering subprocesses [ loproc ] q + |q g + , q + g q + , + g + , involve _ three _ coloured partons and , then",
    ", sudakov resummation is by far less trivial .",
    "a key ingredient for the exponentiation in the dy process is the factorization of the corresponding multigluon matrix elements in the soft limit .",
    "since the colour structure of a two - parton hard - scattering is trivial , primary soft radiation from the two hard partons factorizes as in qed .",
    "then the subsequent parton radiation can be factorized in non - interfering angular - ordered cascades because of the coherence properties @xcite of qcd emission .    in the case of prompt - photon production , and , in general , in scattering processes produced by hard interactions of more than two qcd partons , the colour and momentum flows in the partonic subprocess are more involved .",
    "in particular , the interplay between colour exchange in the hard scattering and colour transitions induced by parton radiation spoils qed - like factorization of soft - gluon emission . therefore , both",
    "_ colour correlations _ and _ soft - gluon interferences _ have to be properly taken into account .",
    "it turns out that , in general , the threshold logarithmic corrections can not be resummed in a single exponential factor @xcite : one has to deal with exponential matrices that couple the various colour channels of the hard - scattering subprocess .    however , the three - parton subprocesses in eq .",
    "( [ loproc ] ) are a special case among the multiparton configurations .",

    "] that can be constructed by combining @xmath37 and then , because of colour conservation , soft - gluon radiation can not induce colour transitions in the hard - scattering subprocess .",
    "owing to the absence of colour correlations , we conclude that the logarithmically - enhanced threshold corrections in prompt - photon hadroproduction are embodied by three radiative factors ( one factor for each of the lo partonic channels in eq .",

    "the pattern of these soft - gluon interferences is typical of multiparton hard - scatterings .",
    "general theoretical methods to perform sudakov resummation in processes initiated by hard scattering of more than two qcd partons have recently been developed by two groups .",
