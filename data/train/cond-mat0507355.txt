    "the phenomenon of geometric frustration is now seeing a surge of interest due to the growing number of unique ground states which arise from networks of spins in triangular motifs.@xcite , @xcite in particular , over the last few years , discoveries such as heavy - fermion behavior,@xcite spin - ice ordering,@xcite and even novel superconductivity @xcite have been observed in materials which have magnetic sublattices of corner - shared tetrahedra ( such as the spinels and pyrochlores ) .",
    "this has led to increased theoretical interest in these systems , which were originally suggested by anderson to be excellent candidates for exotic magnetism , such as the dynamic resonating valence bond state.@xcite although very few examples in the literature exist of this elusive class of materials , new discoveries of the complex magnetism in these systems continue to intrigue the condensed matter community .",
    "one of the more curious discoveries of late lies within the spinel materials li@xmath6mn@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "these were once targets for the lithium ion battery community , but they were later discovered to have complicated magnetic properties based upon the frustrated sublattice that they have in common .",
    "complete removal of li species results in @xmath7-mno@xmath8 , which orders below 32 k into a magnetic unit cell with 256 spins.@xcite the next member in the series , limn@xmath8o@xmath9 , exhibits partial mn@xmath5/mn@xmath10 charge ordering at 280 k followed by a very complex 3d long range magnetic order below 60 k. remarkably , the long range order co - exists with short range , nearest neighbor length scale , order down to the lowest temperature investigated , 1.5 k.@xcite,@xcite but it is the material li@xmath8mn@xmath8o@xmath9@xcite which has perhaps the most remarkable ground state .",
    "this material is synthesized by chemie douce , or soft chemistry , insertion of li ions into limn@xmath8o@xmath9 .",
    "the magnetic sublattice , which is populated by mn@xmath5 spins , has a slight tetragonal distortion ( due to the jahn - teller effect ) from the ideal corner - shared tetrahedral network that is seen in the cubic pyrochlores . nonetheless , this distortion is small , and the sublattice remains , topologically , three dimensional ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "magnetic susceptibility data showed signs of short range correlations up to t @xmath3 400 k. neutron diffraction on powder samples revealed broad features indicative of short range magnetic correlations appearing below 150 k. with decreasing temperature these features took on a pronounced warren line shape , a signature of 2d correlations.@xcite this is a remarkable result given the 3d topology of the mn sublattice .",
    "the intensity of the warren reflections increased sharply between 50 k and 40 k in an almost first - order fashion .",
    "the maximum 2d spin correlation length , obtained by fitting to the warren function , was @xmath3 90  , a relatively large but finite value , which remained unchanged from 40 k to 1.6 k. from the positions of the magnetic reflections , the authors suggested that the 2d correlations could be assigned to a q = @xmath4 x @xmath4 structure confined to the kagom sheets ( see figure 1 ) , but this assignment was based on the observation of only two magnetic reflections.@xcite    mn@xmath8o@xmath9 showing the li - o and mn - o octahedra .",

    "n_-butyl lithium .",
    "after gentle heating at 40@xmath14 c for 5 days , the final product was filtered and washed well with sodium - dried hexane .",
    "the product was tested for phase purity using a guinier - hgg camera in a sealed mylar sample holder .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility was measured in a sealed capsule using a quantum design squid magnetometer .",

    "all experiments were completed at the m20 beamline at triumf , vancouver , canada in a he - flow cryostat which reached temperatures from 2 k to 150 k. zero - field ( zf ) and longitudinal field ( lf ) measurements were made in applied fields of up to 2 kg .",
    "dc magnetic susceptibility measurements made in an applied field of 500 g qualitatively reproduced the previous results of wills and co - workers ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "there was no curie - weiss behavior detected up to 350 k , and indeed , previous measurements detected no such behavior up to 800 k.@xcite this is a signature of frustrated systems - the curie - weiss region is pushed to higher temperatures due to strong antiferromagnetic interactions between the spins .",
    "there is also a broad feature at t @xmath3 110 k which makes it difficult to perform a curie - weiss analysis .",
    "this peak is interpreted as a signature of short - ranged magnetic ordering of the mn@xmath5 spins .",
    "a cusp in the susceptibility occurs just below 50 k , indicative of the onset of the relatively long range 2d order found in the neutron data .",
    "the divergence of the fc / zfc data at high temperatures could be due to a small impurity , or the presence of magnetic correlations .",
    "the lack of impurity lines in the x - ray diffraction data suggests the latter explanation over the former .",
    "mn@xmath1o@xmath2  for an applied field of h = 500 g. zero field - cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled data sets ( fc ) are denoted .",
    "a broad feature at @xmath3 110 k suggests the onset of magnetic correlations ( t@xmath16 ) , and a sharper peak at @xmath3 50 k corresponds to the nel temperature ( t@xmath17 ) .",
    "the fc / zfc divergence at higher temperatures is due to magnetic correlations ( there is no evidence for impurities through x - ray diffraction measurements ) . ]",
    "@xmath0sr measurements in zero - field ( zf ) identified a two - component lineshape which became prominent below 150 k. this data was fit to a kubo - toyabe function , to account for relaxation processes from nuclear dipoles , and an exponential function , to account for relaxation of magnetic origin .    @xmath18    where p(t ) is the muon polarization function , a is the asymmetry , f is the nuclear dipolar fraction , g@xmath19 is the kubo - toyabe lineshape , and @xmath7@xmath20 and @xmath7@xmath21 are the relaxation rates ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the former rate is slower than the latter , which accounts for the quasi - static ordering seen above 50 k as a decrease in polarization at early times .",
    "the fraction , f , represents the fraction of the slow kubo - toyabe signal of the total signal . at high temperatures ( ie .",
    "150 k ) , this is 1 . as one cools down ( see figure 5(a ) ) , this fraction decreases as the fast exponential component grows in size .",
    "this shows that a separate population of spins starts to slow down and grow in size below 150 k , which correlates nicely with the broad feature in the dc susceptibility at 110 k. at 57 k , this population represents about 25 percent of the total asymmetry . below 50 k ,",
    "about a third of the asymmetry is oscillating ( corresponding to about 50 percent of the spins ordered ) .",
    "the kubo - toyabe lineshape is , explicitly :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the second moment of the field distribution of nuclear dipolar origin .",
    "a rise in the relaxation rate to a maximum at 50 k is typical of the dynamics associated with magnetic transitions to long range ordered ground states .",
    "the physical origin of this is the longer correlation times near a phase transition ( known as critical slowing down ) .",
    "the lack of a sharp maximum at 50 k could be due to either the coarseness of the temperature steps near t@xmath24 , or the abrupt nature of the transition .",
    "the appearance of a second component at temperatures much larger than 50 k , however , is unusual and its origin is due to the gradual slowing down of spins over decades in temperature ( another common feature of magnetically frustrated systems ) . a likely cause of this is the formation of short - ranged spin correlations , as suggested by previous neutron work .",
    "it is also unusual that the relaxation persists to low temperatures below 50 k. this is evidence for fluctuating spins co - existing with ordered spins as t @xmath25 0 k. further signatures of the dynamic nature of this ground state is seen in the longitudinal field measurements ( lf ) , which show that even strong fields do not completely decouple the signal .",
    "zf-@xmath0sr spectra taken below 50 k show an oscillating component from muon precession in a local internal magnetic field .",
    "fourier transforms revealed three well - defined frequencies , which were used to fit the data below 50 k in the regime 0 s @xmath11 t @xmath11 2 @xmath0s ( see figure 4 ) . for longer time scales ,",
    "the data was fit to a kubo - toyabe lineshape multiplied by an exponential .",
    "@xmath26    in this equation , a@xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the asymmetries , relaxation rates , and frequencies of the three components , respectively .",

    "= 0.14(3 ) .",
    "the two higher frequencies show the same fit for the lower frequency with a normalization factor . for comparison ,",
    "the expected power - laws for 3d heisenburg and mean field theory have been shown . ]",
    "sr data at ( a ) t = 2 k , ( b ) t = 66 k , ( c ) t = 150 k. the data at 2 k in zf has been omitted in the early time signal where oscillations are observed . ]",
    "the asymmetries of the oscillating and non - oscillating components are noted in figure 5 .",
    "the drop in asymmetry of the ordered signal at 50 k coincides with a rise of the kubo - toyabe / exponential signal .",
    "the asymmetry of the oscillating components was found to be only about a third of the expected total asymmetry , suggesting that only a portion of the spins are ordered at 2 k. the remainder of the spins are either still fluctuating or in short - ranged ordered spin clusters .",
    "the three frequency fit represents the data well , however the corresponding temperature dependence of all three components is uncharacteristic of 3d ordering .",
    "all three show a very rapid increase to saturation below 50 k.    the low frequency component of the data has been fit to the phenomenological form :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the critical exponent .",
    "although a rigorous examination of the power law would require more points around t@xmath17 , it is clear that the transition is not mean - field like ( @xmath32 = 0.5 ) , or 3d heisenburg ( @xmath32 = 0.33 ) , as shown in figure 6 . the fit , to free parameters for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and t@xmath24   for the lowest frequency component , is @xmath32 = 0.14(3 ) , which is more consistent with the 2d ising critical exponent of @xmath32 = 0.125 , and a transition temperature of 48 + /-",
    "2 k. the rapid increase of the precession frequency is also characteristic of a first - order like transition , which is echoed in the spin - spin correlation lengths extracted from neutron scattering measurements .",
    "the relaxation rate of the 1/t@xmath34 tail is approximately a constant below t@xmath24 .",
    "this is strong evidence that there are coexisting regions of ordered and disordered spins .",
    "since the behaviour of the disordered spins ( from the 1/t@xmath34 tail ) changes abruptly below t@xmath24 , these spins must be involved with the transition ( it is unlikely that there is bulk phase separation ) .",
    "lf-@xmath0sr spectra show that most of the signal is decoupled with the application of applied magnetic fields .",
    "this indicates that there is a large population of static spins .",
    "however , there is a small fraction of spins ( about 10 percent of the total volume fraction ) which do not decouple , even down to 2 k and in strong fields ( see figure 7 at t = 2 k and t = 66 k ) .",
    "this suggests the coexistence of magnetic order and regions of persistently fluctuating moments .",
    "our @xmath0sr results present strong evidence for the model proposed by @xcite , i.e. a q = @xmath4 x @xmath4 ordering for the mn spins in the kagom layers . below 50 k",
    ", there appears to be a population of spins ( roughly 50 percent ) which lie in an ordered state with respect to the muon timescale . in order to shed some light on the nature of this ordering ,",
    "one must first attempt to identify the muon site .",
    "given that there are three separate frequencies in the data , the first place to start is to assume that the muon is experiencing three distinct internal fields from either the magnetic structure or different muon sites or both .",
    "it is therefore important to locate the muon sites within li@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2  .",
    "the most probable site is one which is equidistant from the oxygen positions .",
    "there are three obvious choices for this : at the interstitial sites ( 3/8 , 3/8 , 3/8 ) , ( 1/4 , 1/4 , 1/4 ) , or ( 0 , 0.75 , 0.125 ) . detailed calculations of the field experienced by the muon at each site were made by using the equation :      in which @xmath36 is the muon gyromagnetic ratio ( 135.5 mhz / t ) and @xmath37 is the dipolar moment at site @xmath38 at a distance @xmath39 from the muon site .",
    "this is the relaxation rate @xmath40 ( due to random nuclear dipolar fields ) which is extracted from the kubo - toyabe fits to the high temperature data ( 150 k ) .",
    "sums were made over several unit cells in length in the three crystallographic directions .",
    "the theoretical values for the relaxation rates at the three sites of interest are listed in table i.    .possible muon sites with the calculated relaxation rate .",
    "the ( 0 , 0.75 , 0.125 ) position has a value which is closest to the fits derived from the muon data ( @xmath40 = 0.275 @xmath0s@xmath41 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      with this excellent agreement of the internal field at the muon sites with respect to the ratios of the frequencies observed , one can now estimate the size of the average static moment at the mn@xmath5 site .",
    "this is done by evaluating the the size of the field at these points by dividing the precession frequency by the muon gyromagnetic ratio ( @xmath36 = 135.5 mhz / t ) , and then comparing this to our calculations of the frequency distribution .",
    "the resultant average static moment of 1.5(1 ) @xmath42   per atom is shy of the expected value for mn@xmath5 moments of 4.0 @xmath42 .",
    "reduced moments are common in magnetically frustrated systems.@xcite another possible origin of the small moment is that there are some disordered spins within the ordered kagom layers , leading to a lower average static moment .    in subsequent lf-@xmath0sr  experiments",
    ", we observed that applied fields do not completely decouple the signal ( see figure 6 ) , which suggests that the dynamics are not quenched easily .",
    "the rise of the relaxation rate to a constant value below 50 k is consistent with a dynamic ground state as well .",
    "other frustrated systems , such as tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath43 , show this behaviour , which has been interpreted as a ground state stabilized by quantum fluctuations.@xcite the asymptotic relaxation rate , @xmath3 1 @xmath0s@xmath41 , is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this distinguishes the behavior of this system from that associated with glassy spin freezing , such as seen in y@xmath8mo@xmath8o@xmath44 , which has a prominent cusp in the relaxation rate and a low temperature value which is about 250 times smaller than li@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2  .@xcite highly correlated dynamics typical of frustrated materials , such as spin - liquid behavior,@xcite would give rise to purely exponential relaxation , or ",
    "undecoupable \" gaussian features in zero - field @xmath0sr  .@xcite",
    "li@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2  is qualitatively different from either a pure spin glass or a pure spin liquid , with the co - existence of ordered and fluctuating spins .",
    "this partial ordering phenomena is rare in magnetism , but perhaps not unexpected .",
    "intercalated materials are often found to be multi - phasic , for example , by virtue of the reaction process , which depends on the reaction kinetics of butyl - lithium on micrograins of sample .",
    "this explanation seems unlikely , however , due to the lack of impurity lines found in x - ray powder diffraction data using the guinier camera .",
    "partial magnetic ordering at t@xmath24   has been seen in a wide variety of materials , and similar behavior has been seen in the @xmath0sr  literature .",
    "one material in particular , the oxygen doped superconductor la@xmath1cuo@xmath45 , has recently been examined by savici _",
    "_ @xcite it is believed , from the perspective of various experimental probes , that the magnetism develops with the superconductivity at the same temperature",
    ". however , the magnetic component develops in an abrupt way - that is , there is a rapid rise in the frequency of the muon signal at t@xmath24   which is atypical of three dimensional phase transitions .",
    "this is not due to a poor quality of fit to the data - like in li@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2  , the frequency has a discontinuous evolution at t@xmath46  . in la@xmath1cuo@xmath45 ,",
    "the explanation for this result is that there is a spin - density wave structure ( as revealed by neutron scattering ) in isolated , two dimensional `` islands '' of spins which reside within the superconducting fluid .",
    "the small asymmetry of the oscillating component ( of about 30 percent with respect to the total asymmetry ) was used to calculate the the size of these islands , and a corresponding `` swiss - cheese '' model of superconductivity was developed to explain the results .",
    "it may be that in li@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2  , similar two dimensional islands of the ordered phase coexist within a sea of quasi - static spins .",
    "this could be due to inhomogeneities , or due to some exotic ordering mechanism which favours domain formation of such a ground state .",
    "further studies are clearly needed to distinguish the two possibilities .    with respect to other spinel oxides ,",
    "li@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2  has common features with materials such as znfe@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the low temperature ground state of znfe@xmath8o@xmath9 is an ordered antiferromagnet with a k = ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) wavevector at 10 k.@xcite however , it has been known for some time that a short range ordered state exists at temperatures much higher than t@xmath24   - as high as 100 k. broad peaks appear in elastic neutron scattering experiments which persist to low temperatures .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0sr  data on this material shows a two - component lineshape below 100 k in accordance with the slowing down of spins in a short range ordered state . with neutron and @xmath0sr  studies combined",
    ", the consensus is that at t@xmath24= 10 k , only about 30 percent of the volume fraction is long range ordered .",
    "the remaining fraction are in `` superantiferromagnetic '' clusters of short range ordered spins with sizes of about 30    ( incidentally , this is in good agreement with the spin - spin correlation length in the li@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2  neutron scattering data of about 20    at 100 k @xcite ) .",
    "the similarities between these two materials are considerable , both with short range ordered states at high temperatures , followed by a transition to a co - existing long range ordered state at low temperatures .",
    "the @xmath0sr  data on znfe@xmath1o@xmath2 suggests there is some competition between these two states below t@xmath24 , with the volume fraction of the lro clusters becoming larger at the expense of the sro clusters .",
    "this has not been observed in li@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2  .",
    "larger fields are also needed to decouple the lf-@xmath0sr  data in znfe@xmath1o@xmath2 , which suggests that significant dynamics play a role at low temperatures .",
    "the ground state is inhomogeneous in both cases , but notable differences exist between these two materials .    a closer relative to li@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2  is the single - lithiated spinel limn@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "as mentioned above , this material orders into a lro state at 60 k. the magnetic unit cell is enormously complicated , with a k = ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/4 ) structure and 1152 spins within.@xcite a detailed magnetic structure is at this time unavailable .",
    "however , it is known that there is a sro state which exists to high temperatures .",
    "recently , spin polarized neutron scattering measurements revealed that above t@xmath24= 65 k the observable magnetic cross section is entirely due to sro spins on a length scale of @xmath3 3.5 (second mn neighbors ) .",
    "@xcite as the temperature is reduced below t@xmath24 , the fraction of the total magnetic cross section associated with lro increases , reaching a maximum value of only 50 percent at 1.5 k. inelastic scattering shows that even at 1.5 k , @xmath3 20 percent of the spins are still fluctuating .",
    "limn@xmath8o@xmath9 thus shows a complex magnetic ground state with co - existing 3d lro , sro , and fluctuating spins .",
    "this is similar to the situation found for li@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2  but the details are different as there is no true lro in this material but only 2d sro of significant , but finite , extent at the lowest temperatures .    in broader terms of comparison , li@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2  is very distinct from other frustrated sublattices .",
    "gd@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath43 has been suggested to be an example of a system which has a kagom ordering on a pyrochlore lattice.@xcite the mechanism is very different in this case , with dipolar interactions influencing the low - temperature physics of the gd moments ordering .",
    "however , the real canonical examples of the 2d kagom lattice are the jarosites . for years , srcr@xmath47ga@xmath48o@xmath49 ( scgo ) was considered to be an example of the unusual physics which develops in kagom systems , being a material which has exhibited spin - glass to spin - liquid characteristics depending on the cr - site coverage and sample quality.@xcite,@xcite however , this material , being of the magnetoplumbite structure , is better described as an array of bilayer kagom units rather than the pure structure .",
    "the jarosites , of general formula ab@xmath50(so@xmath2)@xmath1(oh)@xmath51 , with b being the magnetic species , represent the best physical realization of the kagom lattice.@xcite , @xcite although disorder within these layers is common , most of these materials have a high site coverage that is still within the percolation limit .",
    "a large portion of them form lro ground states as well , in either the q = 0 or q = @xmath4 x @xmath4 structures.@xcite the latter structure has been shown to be more stable than the former due to quantum effects which choose this state from the multitude of classically degenerate states.@xcite however , if one includes next nearest - neighbor interactions , the situation becomes more complicated . for second neighbor ( j@xmath8 ) and third neighbor interactions ( j@xmath13 ) , the q = 0 state is preferred for j@xmath8 @xmath12 j@xmath13 and the q = @xmath4 x @xmath4 for j@xmath8 @xmath11 j@xmath13.@xcite",
    "the situation becomes even more elaborate if interplane interactions are considered as well.@xcite more detailed studies are needed to clarify the nature of the spin interactions in li@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2  , such as been done recently for the jarosite kcr@xmath13od@xmath52(so@xmath9)@xmath8 with inelastic neutron scattering experiments.@xcite    it is unclear why a three dimensional system such as li@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2  would order with small regions of correlated 2d spins .",
    "although these spin clusters have been observed in other spinels , as mentioned above , there is as of yet no explanation for why this would occur",
    ". the most intriguing work as of late is on the spinel zncr@xmath8o@xmath9 , in which the authors , through neutron scattering experiments , demonstrate that hexagonal , 2d spin clusters play an important role in the low - temperature spin dynamics.@xcite these hexagonal `` protectorates '' form independently of one another , and their excitations are the origin for the local zero energy modes in the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "it is suggested that the formation of spin clusters might be a central theme of self - organization in frustrated materials , which in many cases can not have conventional nel ground states .",
