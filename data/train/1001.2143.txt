    "superconductivity in the cuprates is destroyed by phase fluctuations of the order parameter , without that its amplitude would suffer any significant depreciation.@xcite this can only happen when cooper pairs are fairly local entities , such as to provide superfluidity like features with a @xmath0 scaling with the superfluid density at zero temperature@xcite and xy characteristics of the transition,@xcite in strong contrast to the mean field characteristics of standard amplitude fluctuation controlled bcs superconductivity .",
    "the local nature of the cooperons also implies that pairing correlations must develop already well above @xmath0 .",
    "because of the charged and local nature of the particles involved in this pairing , its has a strong effect on the local lattice deformations to which they are irrevocably coupled .    in principle one can now envisage two scenarios : + ( i ) if the coupling is very strong , the charge carriers form bipolarons , which in principle can condense into a superfluid phase - the bipolaronic superfluidity,@xcite but which are more likely to end up in an insulating state of statically disordered localized bipolarons , if not a charge ordered state of them.@xcite + ( ii ) if the the coupling is not quite as strong , the charge carriers will be in a mixture of quasi - free itinerant states and localized states , where they are momentarily selftrapped in form of local bound pairs .",
    "local dynamical pairing then occurs at some temperature @xmath20 , at which the single - particle density of states develops a pseudogap , because of the electrons getting paired up on a finite time scale.@xcite upon lowering the temperature , those phase incoherent locally dynamically fluctuating pairs acquire short range phase coherence , which ultimately leads to their condensation and phase locking in a superfluid state at some temperature @xmath21 , exclusively controlled by phase fluctuations.@xcite experimental evidence for that is now well established in terms of the transient meissner effect,@xcite the nernst effect in thermal transport,@xcite the torque measurements of diamagnetism@xcite and a proximity induced pseudogap of metallic films deposited on la@xmath22sr@xmath1cuo@xmath19.@xcite    standard low temperature bcs superconductors are controlled by amplitude fluctuations , with the feature that at @xmath0 the expectation value of the amplitude vanishes , i.e. , the number of cooper pairs goes to zero and thus the phase of the order parameter becomes redundant . for superfluid he , the opposite is the case .",
    "the onset of superfluidity is controlled exclusively by spatial phase locking of the bosonic order parameter .",
    "the amplitude there is fixed , since the number of bosonic he atoms is conserved .",
    "the superfluid state is destroyed at a certain @xmath21 , given by the phase stiffness of the condensate .",
    "the high @xmath0 superconductors lie between those two limiting cases .",
    "amplitude and phase fluctuations are then strongly inter - related and have to be treated on equal footing .",
    "the onset of a finite amplitude of the order parameter happens at a temperature @xmath20 , while that of the phase locking of the bosonic cooperons , signaling the onset of superconductivity , occurs at @xmath21 , which can be well below @xmath20 .",
    "dealing with such a situation requires to disentangle the description of phase and amplitude fluctuations of the cooperons .",
    "cooperons are neither true bosons nor hard - core bosons , but their center of mass can be associated to bosons in real space . using a renormalization procedure one can project out such bosons of the cooperons , leaving us with remnants arising from kinematical interactions due to their non - bosonic statistics coming from their internal fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "that leads to a damping of such bosons .",
    "those bosons have an amplitude and a phase and hence can account for both : ( i )  their dissociation into fermion pairs at @xmath20 , where their amplitude disappears together with the closing of the pseudogap in the fermionic single - particle subsector and ( ii )  the breaking up their spatial phase coherence at @xmath21 , where the bosons enter into a phase disordered boson metallic state , albeit keeping short range phase coherence in a finite temperature regime above @xmath21 .",
    "this scenario follows some old ideas in the early days of the bcs theory , when exploring the interaction between the electrons and the cooper pairs in a perturbative way,@xcite or , in a more recent study , using a phenomenological picture for strong inter - relations between the two.@xcite in the approach we have been following now for several years , the inter - relation between phase and amplitude fluctuations is cast into andreev scattering of the fermions on bosons .",
    "it results in a partial trapping of the fermions in form of localized bound fermion pairs in real space , and leads to fermionic excitations , which are in a superposition of itinerant and localized states , consistent with recent stm imaging results.@xcite the pairing we are considering here corresponds to a resonant pairing , induced by fluctuating molecular bonds driven by intrinsic dynamical lattice instabilities .",

    "resonant pairing systems can most efficiently be described by a boson fermion model ( bfm ) , such as i had conjectured shortly after the proposition of the bipolaronic superconductivity.@xcite this phenomenological model represents a mixture of itinerant fermions and localized bosons locally bound fermion pairs with an exchange interaction between the two .",
    "a common chemical potential is assumed such as to assure that we are dealing with a unique species of charge carriers .",
    "they must exist simultaneously in ( i )  itinerant states circling around the trapping centers and ( ii )  as localized states on the trapping centers , the moment they pair up .",
    "this picture is quite general and does not depend on any specific mechanism for pairing .",
    "it can arise from holes in a strongly correlated hubbard system close to half filling,@xcite where the exchange happens between hole singlet - pairs and itinerant uncorrelated holes@xcite or , as we have been pursuing it for years , from a polaronic mechanism .",
    "our picture of hole - doped cuprates is based on an ensemble of effective sites , embedded in a crystalline structure , each one being composed of a deformable cation - ligand complex , surrounded by an undeformable local environment , the four - site rings , see fig .",
    "the local environments of neighboring deformable molecular clusters overlap with each other , which assures a potentially metallic phase of the charge carriers .",
    "if the coupling of electrons into bosonic bound pairs outweighs their kinetic energy , it leads to a bose liquid , which can be either superfluid or insulating , without that any fermions are present in the background .",
    "high @xmath0 materials do however exhibit such a background fermi sea and at the same time a transition into a superfuid state which is governed by the dynamics of bosonic fermion - pairs rather than by the opening up of a gap in the electronic single - particle density of states .",
    "itinerant bosons are induced upon hole doping .",
    "they form and disappear spontaneously on the deformable cation - ligand clusters and thereby break the crystal symmetry on a local level .",
    "this resonating pairing originates from the local dynamical lattice instabilities and metastability of the cuprates .",
    "it implies that those systems are intrinsically inhomogeneous , having segregated , upon doping , into effective sites of molecular clusters , partially occupied by such bosons .",
    "resonating pairs of fermions , implies electrons fluctuating in and out of those deformable clusters , on which they self - trap themselves in form of bound pairs on a finite time scale .",
    "this situation is energetically more favorable than that of purely localized bosonic bound fermion pairs or itinerant uncorrelated fermions .",
    "it benefits from a lowering of the ionic level due to a polaron level shift and from the bound fermion pairs acquiring itinerancy .",
    "let us now demonstrate that on the basis of a small cluster calculations , following a previous detailed study@xcite on that .",
    "the segregation of the cuo@xmath16 plane charge distribution , upon hole doping , has been seen in stm imaging studies@xcite and a sketch for such segregation is illustrated in fig .",
    "it consists of nano - size cu@xmath19o@xmath23 domains composed of deformable cu - o - cu bonds which are capable of trapping momentarily two itinerant holes from the surrounding cu@xmath19o@xmath19 plaquettes .",
    "those latter form the remnant back bone structure corresponding to the undoped cuprates carrying the itinerant charge carriers .",

    "i would like to thank my colleagues tadek domanski and alfonso romano for having participated in numerous theoretical studies on which this present attempt , to develop a global picture of the cuprates , is based .",
    "i thank juergen roehler , who kept me regularly informed about relevant experimental results as well and his critical and constructive comments , which helped me in my understanding those materials .",

    "<S> the intrinsic metastable crystal structure of the cuprates results in local dynamical lattice instabilities , strongly coupled to the density fluctuations of the charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> they acquire in this way simultaneously both , delocalized and localized features . </S>",
    "<S> it is responsible for a partial fractioning of the fermi surface , i.e. , the fermi surface gets hidden in a region around the anti - nodal points , because of the opening of a pseudogap in the normal state , arising from a partial charge localization . </S>",
    "<S> the high energy localized single - particle features are a result of a segregation of the homogeneous crystal structure into checker - board local nano - size structures , which breaks the local translational and rotational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing in such a system is dynamical rather than static , whereby charge carriers get momentarily trapped into pairs in a deformable dynamically fluctuating ligand environment . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the intrinsically heterogeneous structure of the cuprates must play an important role in this type of superconductivity . </S>"
