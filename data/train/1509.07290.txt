    "when studying a phenomenon , one is generally interested in overriding effects .",
    "nonlinear science has been used to account for some phenomena in physics , biology and modeling of social facts that could not be otherwise explained , even at a qualitative level . among these phenomena , we can number self - sustained oscillations and noise activated transitions . a paradigmatic model for oscillating systems is the van der pol circuit , named after the work of balthazar van der pol , who introduced relaxation oscillations to describe the cycles produced by self - sustained oscillating systems such as the triode circuit.@xcite . with its many variants ,",
    "van der pol oscillators have served as a paradigm in various physical , chemical , and biological processes @xcite .",
    "a special merit of van der pol has been to propose a dimensionless ( or reduced ) equation in the terminology of curie @xcite , for it can be used to explain various system regardless their origins .",
    "the van der pol system was not the first one where self oscillating behaviors were observed , but this is the first reduced equation in curie s sense . with its graphical representation @xcite",
    "van der pol also contributed to change the way in which these nonlinear phenomena had to be investigated .",
    "the oscillatory motion can be influenced by internal or external noise @xcite and the resulting interplay between nonlinearities and noise can induce transitions similar to the standard transition between two stable points @xcite . in the case of self - sustained oscillations , one observes a transition between two stable orbits rather than two points .",
    "however , it has been shown that the escape is indeed of the kramers type for uncorrelated noise @xcite even in presence of time delay @xcite , and it can be ascribed to the existence of a quasipotential or pseudopotential @xcite .",
    "the quasipotential allows to estimate the energy barriers , and indicates that for most parameters , a single attractor is dominantly stable @xcite , while the other is characterized by a small energy barrier .",
    "the effect of a finite correlation time has also been investigated , and it has been found that , as expected for static potential , also the periodic orbits are stabilized by the finite correlation @xcite .",
    "noise , however , can produce also effects that are more radical , for it can induce a structural ( or topological ) change of the solutions @xcite .",
    "this is the case when noise induces a stochastic bifurcation , that may be characterized with a qualitative change of the stationary probability distribution .",
    "moreover , noise can stabilize unstable equilibria and shift bifurcations , or it can even induce new stable states that have no deterministic counterpart ( for instance noise can excite internal modes of oscillation and it can even enhance the response of a nonlinear system to external signals @xcite ) . when the noise driven stochastic differential equation is colored , the nature of the stochastic process becomes non - markovian and can not be treated with the standard fokker - planck techniques .",
    "the study of stochastic nonlinear systems driven by colored noise has been undertaken by a number of investigation @xcite . on a general ground correlated noise appears as the result of the gross approximation of a system over some finite scale that masks the effect of slow variables @xcite , as it has been argued in ecology @xcite or electronic circuits @xcite .",
    "birhythmic oscillators are no exception , as they emerge in biochemical reactions @xcite or sleeping patterns @xcite where such coarsening could occur . in many treatments , one",
    "is essentially concerned with an equilibrium thermal bath at a finite temperature , which stimulates the reaction coordinate to cross the activation energy barrier . in this paper",
    ", we wish to investigate the transition between orbits @xcite , characterized by different frequencies ( and hence birhythmic systems ) .",
    "to do so we analytically treat the effects of gaussian correlated noise on a special van der pol oscillator system that displays a birhythmic behavior , for the two coexisting attractors characterized by different frequencies .",
    "we search the relation between stochastic bifurcations and noise correlation time on the dynamical properties , taking the system parameters and the statistical characteristics of the noise ( e.g. , noise intensity and noise correlation time ) as bifurcation parameters .",
    "our approach of the bifurcations is based on the stochastic averaging method @xcite , that is separating fast and slow variables of the oscillator .",

    "[ sec : model ] we discuss the model and the numerical approach to the discretized equations . in sect .",

    "equation ( [ eq4 ] ) , even when @xmath17 , is of the van der pol type equation , inasmuch most of the practical applications are driven by weak noise intensities .",

    "the main conclusion of this work has been the existence of a drastic change ( a p - bifurcation @xcite ) of the probability distribution function of a birhythmic van der pol like oscillator subject to exponentially correlated noise .",
    "we have particularly investigated the evolution of the modified van der pol oscillator in the region where birhythmicity occurs .",
    "the characteristics of the birhythmic properties are strongly influenced by the nonlinear coefficients as well as the noise intensity and correlation .",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of the bifurcation diagrams in the parameters plane , and it is evident that the noise intensity and the correlation time can be treated as bifurcation parameters .",

    "the simulations have confirmed that the approximated ( obtained through stochastic averaging ) fokker - planck equation well describes this type of birhythmic oscillators .",
    "we therefore expect that real systems ( either biological or electronic circuits ) governed by birhythmic van der pol type equation are very sensitive to changes in the correlation time of the noise .",
    "in fact , the appearance of correlated noise can drastically change the structure of the attractors , that could possibly be a signature of the presence of significatively correlated noise .",
    "for instance , the noise correlation in fig.[fig8 ] or fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] entails that the most stable attractors might become another one , with a different amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) or both different amplitude and frequency ( fig.[fig11 ] , parameter set @xmath157 ) .",
    "summing - up , we have found that the quasiharmonic balance is ( surprisingly ) effective in predicting the features of the full system , as checked with numerical simulations , even when the correlation time is comparable to the period of the solutions , fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , ( and this is even more surprising ) when the two solutions are characterized by different frequencies .",

    "it is therefore tempting to draw the general conclusion that the quasi - harmonic balance is an effective tool for self - oscillatory systems , and even for birhythmic systems characterized by two different frequencies , if the nonlinear terms are kept at bay . of course ,",
