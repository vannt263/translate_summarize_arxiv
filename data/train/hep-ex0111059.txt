    "doubly charged higgs bosons ( ) appear in theories beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "many authors have pointed out that these doubly charged scalar particles occur naturally in the left - right symmetric models which allow small neutrino masses  @xcite , and stress the importance of looking for their existence  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric left - right models in which the @xmath62 gauge symmetry is broken by triplet higgs fields do not conserve baryon and lepton numbers .",
    "they also yield a natural embedding of a large mass for the right - handed majorana neutrino needed for the implementation of the see - saw mechanism for small neutrino masses .",
    "recently , it has pointed out that such models can lead to `` light '' doubly charged higgs particles , in the 100  gev/@xmath63 mass range  @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the doubly charged higgs bosons is that they couple , at tree level , only to charged leptons and to other higgs and gauge bosons , in order to conserve electric charge .",
    "thus doubly charged higgs bosons could be copiously produced in pairs via @xmath64 at lep ii with a differential cross section at tree level depending on the doubly charged higgs boson mass and the centre - of - mass energy of the colliding beams . in left - right symmetric models ,",
    "two higgs triplets arise , conventionnaly labelled left and right handed .",
    "the cross section of @xmath65  is not equal to that for @xmath65 .",
    "the events are characterized by the @xmath66 dependence , where @xmath67 is the angle of the  with respect to the electron beam axis , anticipated for the production of a pair of spin 0 particles via the s - channel z or @xmath68 exchange .",
    "the partial widths of the dominant decay modes , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , have been calculated by huitu and collaborators  @xcite and by swartz  @xcite .",
    "for instance for h decaying into @xmath71 it is , at tree level : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the mass of the doubly charged higgs boson , @xmath74 is the mass of the tau lepton and @xmath75 is the unknown h@xmath71 yukawa coupling constant .",
    "if @xmath76 , values of @xmath77 can ensure the fast decay of the higgs particle ( @xmath78  s ) .",
    "observation of a four lepton final state would provide a clean signature for the identification of the event . on the other hand for values of @xmath79 smaller than about @xmath80",
    "long lived doubly charged higgs bosons could be detected as events with large impact parameter tracks , kinked tracks , or stable doubly charged massive particles .",
    "opal has searched for charged massive particles at centre - of - mass energies up to 183  gev  @xcite .",
    "previous searches for  pair production have been performed with the markii  @xcite and the opal  @xcite detectors using data collected near the z peak and have excluded the existence of the  with mass less than 45.6  gev / c@xmath81 and for values of @xmath75 that extend down to zero , apart from a small band around @xmath82 .",
    "significant couplings to electrons or muons are not likely as there are indirect constraints  @xcite on the decays of @xmath83 from high energy bhabha scattering , of @xmath84 from the absence of muonium  anti - muonium transitions , and of @xmath85 from limits on the flavour changing decay @xmath86 . in this paper , however , we will present our results based on general searches for @xmath65 four leptons with missing energy ( a ) , and four leptons without missing energy ( b ) .",
    "we have considered the following channels : ( a ) @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and ( b ) @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the data set is from  collisions recorded with the opal detector at lep , and is composed of events at centre - of - mass energies between @xmath93 189  gev and 209  gev with a total integrated luminosity of about 614  pb@xmath0 .",
    "a complete description of the opal detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo samples are used to model the pair production of doubly charged higgs bosons as well as to estimate the expected background due to standard model processes .",
    "the simulation of the signal events with one non - zero @xmath94 coupling at a time and with zero lifetime has been done with the monte carlo generator pythia  @xcite modified according to  @xcite .",
    "events have been generated for various mass points ranging from 45  gev/@xmath1 to half the centre - of - mass energy , @xmath95 . at each point on the ( @xmath73,@xmath95 ) plane ,",
    "10000 events for each of the six @xmath96 decays have been generated .",
    "the main sources of background arise from standard model  four - fermion final states ( @xmath97 ) and a small contribution from two - photon ( @xmath98 hadrons , @xmath99 ) and two - fermion ( @xmath100 ff ) processes . for two - photon processes , the phojet  @xcite ,",
    "pythia  @xcite , and herwig  @xcite generators have been used to simulate hadronic final states .",
    "the vermaseren  @xcite generator has been used to estimate the background contribution from all two - photon @xmath101 final states .",
    "all other four - fermion final states have been simulated with grc4f  @xcite .",
    "for the two - fermion final states ,  @xcite was used for the ee@xmath102 final state , and koralz  @xcite and kk2f  @xcite for the @xmath103 and @xmath104 states .",
    "the multi - hadronic events , @xmath105 , were simulated using pythia and kk2f .",
    "all events were processed through the full simulation of the opal detector  @xcite , with the same analysis chain being applied to simulated events and to data .",
    "the final states resulting from @xmath64 processes followed by @xmath96 decays consist of four leptons .",
    "two different analyses are applied depending on the decay assumed : for @xmath106 , @xmath107 or @xmath108 , a selection for four lepton candidates plus missing energy ( resulting from the decays of the tau leptons ) is applied , while for @xmath109 , @xmath110 or @xmath111 , a selection for four leptons ( electrons or muons ) without missing energy is used . although lepton identification is used in the event selection , it is not used for splitting the selected events into the different channels within the two analyses .",
    "the analyses are similar to the r - parity violation search  @xcite that considers four leptons with or without missing energy topologies .",
    "these event selection procedures are described in detail in @xcite and are only briefly outlined below .",
    "the cut values used in the present analysis are optimized for the searches for @xmath112 ( in the missing energy analysis ) and for @xmath113 ( in the no missing energy analysis ) .",
    "the selections are then applied as such for the other channels considered , and the efficiencies are calculated separately for each channel .    the visible energy and the momentum of the event are calculated using the method described in  @xcite .",
    "a preselection is applied , consisting of    * data quality requirements as described in  @xcite ; * vetoes on the energy deposited in the forward detectors to reduce background due to two - photon events and interactions of beam particles with the beam pipe or residual gas : the energy deposited in each silicon - tungsten forward calorimeter and in each forward detector has to be less than 5  gev ( these detectors are located in the forward region , with polar angle  -axis points to the centre of the lep ring , and positive @xmath114 is along the electron beam direction .",

    "the numbers of events remaining after each cut are listed in tables  [ tab : cut_flow_miss ] and  [ tab : cut_flow_nomiss ] .",
    "the poor agreement between data and monte carlo expectation in the early stages of the selections is due to the beam - related backgrounds and incomplete modelling of two - photon processes .",

    "these last errors are determined by shifting each cut by the maximum amount such that distributions from high statistics monte carlo samples remain in agreement with the data .    for the expected number of background events , an uncertainty due to monte carlo statistics ( 4% to 8% ) and a systematic error due to the modelling of the physics variables ( 5% to 7% ) have been taken into account .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty was calculated by summing in quadrature the individual errors .",
    "correlations between systematic uncertainties at different centre - of - mass energies have been taken into account .",
    "in addition to effects included in the detector simulation , a relative efficiency loss of 1.5% to 2.9% arises from beam - related background in the silicon - tungsten forward calorimeter and in the forward detector .",
    "this is estimated using random beam crossing events .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : results ] the observed numbers of events selected by the missing energy and the no missing energy selections ( 17 and 10 ) are consistent with the numbers expected from standard model processes ( 25.19 @xmath140 0.92 @xmath140 1.06 and 6.57 @xmath140 0.50 @xmath140 0.31 ) .",
