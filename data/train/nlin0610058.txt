    "in 1885 stieltjes @xcite suggested the following relations for the roots of the hermite polynomials @xcite    @xmath0    these relations can be considered as the equilibrium configurations of @xmath1 particles on the line interecting pairwise with a repulse logarithmic potential in the harmonic field @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new approach for finding relations like satisfied by the roots of polynomials , which can be generated by a differential equation .",
    "we demonstrate our approach to get relations for the roots of the laguerre polynomials and for the roots of special polynomials associated with rational solutions of the second , the third , and the fourth painlev equations .",
    "the six painlev equations @xmath2 were picked out by painlev and his student gambier from a certain class of second - order differential equations as equations whose general solutions on the one hand , do not have movable critical points and on the other hand , can not be expressed through known elementary or special functions . in other words they define new transcendental functions . however , the equations @xmath3 possess hierarchies of rational and algebraic solutions at certain values of the parameters .",
    "it turned out that such solutions could be described using families of special polynomials .",
    "the history of this question is as follows .",
    "a. i. yablonskii and a. p. vorobev were the first who expressed the rational solutions of @xmath4 via the logarithmic derivative of the polynomials , which now go under the name of the yablonskii ",
    "vorobev polynomials @xcite .",
    "later k. okamoto suggested special polynomials for certain rational solutions of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "h. umemura derived analogous polynomials for some rational and algebraic solutions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "all these polynomials possess a number of interesting properties .",
    "for example , they can be expressed in terms of schur polynomials . besides that the polynomials arise as the so  called tau - functions and satisfy recurrence relations of toda type .",
    "recently these polynomials have been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "apart from rational and algebraic solutions @xmath3 possess one  parameter families of solutions expressible in terms of the classical special functions . in particular cases these special function solutions are reduced to classical orthogonal polynomials and , consequently give rational solutions of the painlev equation in question . for @xmath5",
    "these polynomials are hermite polynomials , for @xmath6 and @xmath7 laguerre polynomials and for @xmath8 jacobi polynomials .",
    "not long ago p. a. clarkson and e. l. mansfield suggested special polynomials for the equations of the @xmath4 hierarchy @xcite .",
    "also they studied the location of their roots in the complex plane and showed that the roots have a very regular structure .",
    "the textbook @xcite characterizes the painlev equations as `` the most important nonlinear ordinary differential equations '' and states that `` many specialists believe that during the twenty - first century the painlev equations will become new members of the community of special functions '' @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the relations for the zeros of the following equations    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    @xmath13    it is known @xcite that particular solutions of equation are the yablonskii - vorobev polynomials .",
    "rational solutions of the second painlev equation can be expressed as the logarithmic derivative of these polynomials . in this work using our approach we obtain some new relations for the zeros of these polynomials .",
    "these relations explain a very regular location of the zeros in the complex plain .",
    "the equations and in their turn possess polynomial solutions , i.e. the umemura polynomials and the ohyama polynomials @xcite , accordingly .",
    "rational solutions of the third painlev equation can be obtained with the help of these polynomials .",
    "the general form of these polynomials is not known at present but using the method of our recent works @xcite one can solve this problem and can get the general form for these polynomials .",
    "however here we present new additional correlations for the zeros of these polynomials .",
    "the equations and also admit polynomial solutions , which are the generalized okamoto polynomials and the generalized hermite polynomials , respectively @xcite .",
    "rational solutions of the fourth painlev equation can be expressed via logarithmic derivative of these polynomials .",
    "the general form of these polynomials is not known as well . in this work",
    "new correlations for the zeros of these polynomials are obtained .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the method of finding the relations for the roots of the polynomials . in this section",
    "we also apply our approach on the example to have the relations for the roots of the laguerre polynomials .",
    "sections 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 are devoted to finding the relations for the zeros of the yablonskii - vorobev polynomials , of the umemura polynomials , of the ohyama polynomials , of the generalized okamoto polynomials and of the generalized hermite polynomials .",
    "all these polynomials are associated with rational solutions of the second , the third and the fourth painlev equations .",
    "let us assume that we have an n - linear ( linear , bilinear etc ) equation of order @xmath14 @xmath15 in addition suppose that this equation admits polynomial solution @xmath16 of degree @xmath17 .",
    "the transformation @xmath18 maps solutions of the equation into solutions of the nonlinear equation @xmath19 note that the degree of is @xmath20 . under such transformation",

    "the rational function can be expanded in a neighborhood of a pole @xmath27 and this gives @xmath28    at the same time we can find expansions of solution @xmath29 near movable singular point @xmath30 using the painlev test @xcite or methods of power geometry@xcite .",
    "the result of calculations for the rational function @xmath29 takes the form @xmath31    assuming @xmath32 , @xmath33 and comparing this series with yields    @xmath34    we are going to use correlations for finding some relations of the zeros of the above mentioned polynomials , which are associated with the rational solutions of the second , the third , and the fourth painlev equations .",
