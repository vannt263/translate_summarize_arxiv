    "with the completion of the icecube detector in december 2010 , a decade - long journey towards building a kilometer - scale neutrino detector was finally concluded ( for a review , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "using this instrument , we aimed to detect the first extraterrestrial neutrinos , and thus to explore territories previously inaccessible to astronomy .",
    "these neutrinos have now been detected : in @xcite , the icecube collaboration presented the first evidence for a flux of high - energy extraterrestrial neutrinos , based on a search for events that start and deposit @xmath0  tev inside the detection volume of icecube .",
    "indications for this flux had already been found in earlier analyses performed on data taken during the construction phase of icecube @xcite .",
    "more recently , the flux was measured down to deposited energies of 10  tev @xcite , and evidence for it was observed using @xmath1-induced tracks from the northern hemisphere @xcite .    here , we present a maximum - likelihood analysis that is based on the event samples of all these analyses .",
    "the samples include track - like events , induced by charged - current @xmath1 interactions , as well as shower - like events , induced by charged - current @xmath8 and @xmath11 interactions and all - flavor neutral - current interactions.17% of all charged - current @xmath11 interactions , a muon is produced in the tau decay , leading to a track - like instead of a shower - like signature . furthermore , charged - current @xmath1 interactions may appear as shower - like if the muon leaves the detector unnoticed . ] in this analysis , we derive improved constraints on the spectrum and the flavor composition of the astrophysical neutrino flux .    in the remainder of this section , we summarize the phenomenology of astrophysical neutrinos and of background muons and neutrinos created in the atmosphere of the earth , and we introduce the icecube detector .",
    "the searches for astrophysical neutrinos that are used for the combined analysis presented here are discussed in section  [ sec : datasets ] .",
    "the analysis method is explained in section  [ sec : method ] , the results are given in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the results in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "astrophysical neutrinos are created in interactions of high - energy cosmic rays with other massive particles or photons @xcite .",
    "the neutrinos , being electrically neutral and hence unaffected by cosmic magnetic fields , will travel in straight lines from their point of origin to earth .",
    "if the interactions happen close to the acceleration sites of the cosmic rays , they will thus reveal those .",
    "unlike gamma rays , which are created in the same processes , the neutrinos are also unlikely to be absorbed during their journey ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "because of these properties , neutrinos are ideal messengers to study the sources of high - energy cosmic rays .",
    "astrophysical neutrinos carry information about these sources in their energy spectrum and flavor composition , even if their individual positions on the sky can not be resolved yet @xcite .",
    "candidate sources include active galactic nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , starburst galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as galactic objects like supernova remnants or pulsar wind nebulae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to first order , the energy spectrum of astrophysical neutrinos follows that of the cosmic rays at their acceleration sites .",
    "if fermi shock acceleration is the responsible mechanism , a power law spectrum @xmath12 with @xmath13 is expected @xcite , although the details depend on the characteristics of the specific sources ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the majority of the astrophysical neutrinos are expected to arise from the decay of pions created in cosmic - ray interactions , i.e. @xmath14 , followed by @xmath15 .",
    "the flavor composition resulting from this decay chain is @xmath16 . taking into account long - baseline neutrino oscillations ,",
    "the flavor composition at earth is different , approximately @xmath17 for this scenario @xcite .",
    "this first order model of the energy spectrum and flavor composition has often been used as a benchmark scenario in the past .",
    "second order corrections to this benchmark model arise e.g. from muon energy losses @xcite and muon acceleration @xcite , these effects can alter both the energy spectrum and flavor composition of the astrophysical neutrino flux .",
    "while the energy spectrum is difficult to constrain by general arguments , there are two limiting scenarios for the flavor composition at the sources : muon - damped sources , in which the high - energy neutrino flux is suppressed due to energy loss processes of the muons , and neutron - beam sources , in which the neutrinos are created from neutron rather than pion decays .",
    "the flavor compositions at the source for these ( idealized ) scenarios are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively @xcite . using the neutrino oscillation parameters from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* inverted hierarchy ) , the expected flavor transitions for the three source classes discussed here are @xmath20 ( pion - decay ) , @xmath21 ( muon - damped ) , and @xmath22 ( neutron - beam ) .    the implications of deviations from the benchmark scenario have been discussed by several authors .",
    "assuming extragalactic sources , @xcite argues that a spectral index @xmath23 is more easily explained in photohadronic scenarios , i.e. by @xmath24-interactions as the origin of the neutrinos .",
    "similarly , @xcite point out that if a hadronuclear origin ( @xmath25-interactions ) in extragalactic sources is assumed , measurements of the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray background ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imply @xmath26 under certain conditions . however , hadronuclear models that take into account the diffuse gamma - ray background as well as recent icecube data @xcite , which point towards a softer spectrum , have also been proposed , e.g.  by @xcite .",
    "other authors invoke spectral arguments to propose that the astrophysical neutrino flux is produced by sources within the milky way @xcite .",
    "finally , the implications of flavor ratios different from the benchmark scenario have been discussed e.g. by @xcite . @xcite",
    "give an overview over the flavor compositions resulting from various standard and non - standard neutrino production and propagation scenarios .",
    "all relevant backgrounds to searches for high - energy astrophysical neutrinos are created in cosmic ray - induced air showers in the atmosphere of the earth .",
    "of all the particles created in air showers , only muons and neutrinos can reach the icecube detector .",
    "atmospheric muons constitute , by far , the most abundant background , triggering the detector at a rate of several  khz .",
    "characteristically , they reach the detector from above the horizon and are first detected on the boundary of the instrumented volume .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos are created at a similar rate , but are detected much less frequently due to their small interaction probabilities .",
    "they reach the detector from all directions , in particular also from below the horizon .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos that have passed through the earth are free of muon background , but also hard to distinguish from astrophysical neutrinos .",
    "in contrast , atmospheric neutrinos arriving from above the horizon are often accompanied by atmospheric muons @xcite , which is never the case for astrophysical neutrinos .    at lower energies ,",
    "the atmospheric neutrino flux is dominated by so - called _ conventional _ atmospheric neutrinos from the decays of kaons and charged pions .",
    "since these particles are likely to interact with air molecules before they decay , the resulting neutrino flux differs from the original cosmic ray flux in its energy and zenith angle dependence : the energy spectrum is steeper ( approximately @xmath27 ) and the flux is enhanced towards the horizon @xcite .",
    "an additional contribution to the atmospheric neutrino flux is expected from the decays of heavy , short - lived hadrons containing a charm or bottom quark . at the energies relevant here , these almost always decay before having the chance to interact , giving rise to a flux of _ prompt _ atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "this flux is predicted to follow that of the cosmic rays more closely , with an energy spectrum of approximately @xmath28 and an isotropic zenith angle distribution .",
    "it is , however , yet to be conclusively observed and predictions for its magnitude vary strongly @xcite .",
    "the icecube detector @xcite consists of 5160 optical modules , installed in the ice underneath the geographic south pole at depths between 1450 and 2450  meters .",
    "the modules are deployed on 86 strings , where the vertical spacing between two modules on a string is approximately 17  meters and the horizontal spacing between two strings is approximately 125  meters .",
    "eight of the strings are part of a more densely instrumented region in the center of the detector , deepcore , which serves as a low energy extension to icecube @xcite .",
    "each optical module is a spherical glass housing that contains a @xmath29-photomultiplier @xcite , together with digitization electronics @xcite .",
    "the icecube neutrino observatory also includes a cosmic - ray detector called icetop , which consists of 81 stations that are installed on the surface above the icecube detector @xcite .",
    "icecube detects neutrino interactions by measuring the cherenkov radiation that is induced by the secondary particles created in the interaction .",
    "the signature of a neutrino interaction in the detector depends on the flavor of the incoming neutrino as well as on the interaction type .",
    "so - called _ tracks _ arise from charged - current @xmath1 interactions , in which a muon is produced together with a hadronic particle shower at the interaction vertex . at the relevant energies ,",
    "the muon has a range of several kilometers , leading to an elongated , track - like signature . due to the long lever arm ,",
    "the directional reconstruction of these events is very precise , with a typical median resolution of better than @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "since the muon will typically leave the detector , and often also enter it from outside , only a lower limit can be determined for the neutrino energy . on the other hand , charged - current @xmath8 and @xmath11 interactions as well as neutral current interactions of all flavors give rise to _",
    "showers_.  pev ) , the tau created in a charged - current @xmath11 interaction can travel sufficiently far ( @xmath31  m / pev ) before decaying such that two separated showers may be observed ; one at the interaction vertex and one at the decay point of the tau .",
    "however , this `` double - bang '' signature has not been observed yet . ]",
    "the electromagnetic and hadronic particle showers produced in these interactions have dimensions that are typically much smaller than the detector spacing , so they appear as point sources of light . as a result , the directional reconstruction of these events is worse than for tracks , typically @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "for both event topologies , the energy deposited in the detector , which is a lower bound for the neutrino energy , can be reconstructed with a resolution of about 15% @xcite . for a track event , usually the differential energy loss or the total muon energy",
    "are estimated .",
    "these quantities are correlated with the energy of the neutrino that produces the muon . however",
    ", their absolute values should be interpreted with care @xcite . because the absolute values are unimportant here ,",
    "the quantities are quoted in arbitrary units in this article .",
    "the construction of the icecube detector was finished in december 2010 .",
    "however , data had already been taken since 2005 , after the installation of the first icecube string .",
    "data used in this analysis were taken with configurations consisting of 40 strings ( 2008/2009 ) , 59 strings ( 2009/2010 ) , 79 strings ( 2010/2011 ) and the full 86-string configuration ( since 2011 ) .",
    "searches for high - energy astrophysical neutrinos have been performed ever since the beginning of icecube data - taking , as before with data collected by icecube s predecessor amanda ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ", we consider only more recent searches , and only those targeted at the tev ",
    "pev energy range .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to searches for a diffuse flux of neutrinos , i.e. we do not include searches that solely aim to identify individual sources , since these typically contain a larger fraction of atmospheric muon background events .",
    "this leaves a total of six searches , listed in table  [ tab : analyses ] .",
    "the searches mainly differ in their strategy to suppress the large background of muons and neutrinos that are created in cosmic ray - induced air showers in the atmosphere of the earth .",
    "the important characteristics of such a strategy are the event topologies that are selected ( listed in the table under `` topology '' ) , the use ( or lack ) of containment criteria ( `` containment '' ) , and the resulting neutrino energy and zenith angle ranges in which the search is sensitive to a flux of astrophysical neutrinos ( `` energy range '' , `` zenith range '' ) .",
    "the table also lists the corresponding data taking period and the observables that are used in the maximum - likelihood analysis .",
    "the individual searches and their background suppression strategies are briefly explained in the following sections , where we have classified them by topology into searches for track - like events ( t1 , t2 ) , searches for shower - like events ( s1 , s2 ) and hybrid event searches , which select both kinds of events ( h1 , h2 ) . for more detailed information",
    ", we refer to the references listed in table  [ tab : analyses ] .",
    "a table listing the fraction of neutrino interaction types that contribute to the individual samples can be found in appendix .",

    "the good angular resolution of these events provides excellent discrimination against downward - going muon events , which can be reduced to a negligible level . because events with interaction vertices outside the instrumented volume can be selected , this strategy allows the selection of large neutrino samples of high purity .",
    "it is however restricted by design to directions from which only neutrinos can reach the detector , i.e. the northern hemisphere and directions close to the horizon .",
    "this implies that atmospheric neutrinos are an irreducible background to searches of this type and can only be distinguished from astrophysical neutrinos on a statistical basis",
    ". because atmospheric neutrinos are predominantly muon neutrinos at all relevant energies , a flux of astrophysical neutrinos will only be visible at very high energies @xmath44  tev .",
    "neutrinos of these energies have a non - vanishing probability to be absorbed during their passage through the earth @xcite , searches for track - like events are therefore most sensitive in the direction of the horizon , where the amount of traversed matter is less compared to more vertical directions .    here",
    "we use the neutrino event samples from two different event selections following this approach , performed on data taken in different periods .",
    "the first one ( `` t1 '' ) uses data taken in 2009/2010 with the 59-string configuration of icecube while the second one ( `` t2 '' ) uses two years of data , taken between 2010 and 2012 with the 79-string and the 86-string configuration of icecube . for both searches , energy and zenith angle information are available for the neutrino sample .",
    "note that we do not use the full event sample provided by the analyses , but restrict ourselves to the high - energy tail of the spectrum .",
    "this degrades the ability to constrain the atmospheric neutrino spectrum ( and thus , indirectly , the astrophysical spectrum ) somewhat , but facilitates the consistent treatment of systematic uncertainties ( which are difficult to account for in the high - statistics threshold region of the track - like searches ) in the combined analysis presented here .",
    "these searches select shower - like events and are thus sensitive to all neutrino flavors . lacking the good angular resolution of tracks , searches of this type achieve background suppression by selecting events with a spherical topology , by requiring the interaction vertex to be contained within the instrumented volume of icecube , and by vetoing events in which light is first detected on the outermost layer of optical modules .",
    "this means that the sensitive analysis volume is smaller than the instrumented volume , but allows the selection of neutrinos coming from any direction .",
    "however , reliable rejection of muon background events is only possible if there is a sufficiently high probability of detecting the incoming muon .",
    "this typically leads to a contamination of residual muon background events at low energies , where muons may produce too little light to be rejected efficiently enough .",
    "event samples selected by two searches for shower - like events are included here , one performed on data taken in 2008/2009 with the 40-string configuration of icecube ( `` s1 '' ) and one performed on data taken in 2009/2010 with the 59-string configuration of icecube ( `` s2 '' ) .",
    "note that the event sample of search s2 has been extended to lower energies compared to what was presented in @xcite , see appendix for further details .",
    "neither analysis originally accounted for the atmospheric self - veto effect , i.e. the possibility to reject atmospheric neutrinos due to atmospheric muons that accompany them @xcite .",
    "for the analysis presented here , the results were corrected for this effect based on a calculation by @xcite ; checks were made to ensure that systematic errors in the description of the effect for these event samples do not affect the results obtained here .",
    "the search s1 provides two event samples with slightly different selection criteria , a low - energy sample ( with deposited energies between 2  tev and 100  tev , `` s1a '' ) and a high - energy sample ( with deposited energies @xmath33  tev , `` s1b '' ) .",
    "both shower searches provide reconstructed energies for their respective event samples .",
    "the two hybrid searches considered here do not make any requirements on the topology of the selected events , which makes them sensitive to any kind of neutrino interaction and to all directions .",
    "the first hybrid analysis ( `` h1 '' ) utilizes the outermost layer of optical modules as a veto against incoming muons , similar to the two shower searches s1 and s2 described above . to ensure a sufficiently high veto probability ,",
    "it is additionally required that more than 6,000  photo - electrons , integrated over all optical modules , be recorded .",
    "this value corresponds to a threshold of @xmath45  tev in deposited energy .",
    "the second hybrid analysis ( `` h2 '' ) employs a more complex veto algorithm that adapts to the energy of the event and additionally searches for early hits that could be caused by an incoming muon . as a result , the threshold for this event selection is significantly lower , @xmath46  tev in deposited energy .",
    "a residual muon background contamination is present in the event samples of both searches , h1 and h2 .",
    "analysis h1 uses data taken in @xmath42 while analysis h2 uses data taken in @xmath37 , both with the 79-string and 86-string configurations of icecube . for both event samples , energy and zenith angle information are available .",
    "analysis h2 additionally provides data on the topology of the selected events ; those in which more than 10  photo - electrons can be associated with an outgoing muon track are classified as tracks , all others as showers.60% ( @xmath4780% ) of all charged - current @xmath1-interactions as tracks at 10  tev ( 1  pev ) . ] the atmospheric self - veto effect was implemented in the same way as for the shower searches ( see above ) , based on @xcite .",
    "data taken in one period is often subjected to multiple analyses , some of which may have overlapping event samples . specifically , among the analyses considered here , three ( t2 , h1 , h2 ) use data taken between 2010 and 2012 and have event samples that overlap .",
    "for the combined analysis presented here however , it is important that the different event samples be statistically independent , i.e. that individual events are not selected more than once . to achieve this",
    ", we identify the overlap between the samples and remove the corresponding events from all but one of the samples , both in simulation and experimental data .",
    "in particular , we remove events that start inside the instrumented volume of icecube from the event sample of analysis t2 and we consider only events from the event sample of analysis h2 for which fewer than 6,000  photo - electrons were recorded . with these adjustments ,",
    "all event samples combined in the maximum - likelihood analysis are statistically independent .",
    "in order to obtain a global picture of the astrophysical neutrino flux measured with icecube , we analyze data from different event selections in a single maximum - likelihood analysis . from each of the searches for astrophysical neutrinos introduced in the previous section",
    ", we use the final selection level sample of experimental data events as well as corresponding samples of simulated neutrino events and , if applicable , muon events .",
    "the data are binned in the available observables and analyzed together . for each component contributing to the measured flux",
    ", probability density functions ( pdfs ) are obtained from the simulated event samples by weighting them to different models .",
    "the sum of all pdfs is then compared to the distribution of experimental data . in the maximum - likelihood procedure , the parameters of the models are varied until the best agreement with the data is achieved .",
    "the models for the different background components and the astrophysical component are described in sections  [ sec : bg ] and [ sec : signal ] , followed by a description of the likelihood method ( section  [ sec : llh ] ) .",
    "the relevant background components to all searches considered here are atmospheric neutrinos and atmospheric muons .",
    "we use the same models to describe the neutrino background in all of the different searches .",
    "the muon background is more specific and is hence modeled individually for each analysis .",
    "the models and parameters for the atmospheric neutrino components are summarized in table  [ tab : bgmodels ] .",
    "for the conventional atmospheric neutrinos , we use the hkkms model by @xcite and for the prompt atmospheric neutrinos , we use the ers model by @xcite .",
    "both models were slightly modified ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in order to be in accordance with measurements of the cosmic - ray spectrum in the energy range above 1  tev ; these modifications are based on the cosmic - ray composition model introduced in @xcite .",

    "the expected muon contamination amounts to @xmath4757% of the observed number of events in the low - energy sample ( s1a ) and @xmath472% in the high - energy sample ( s1b ) @xcite ; for analysis s2 the expected contamination is @xmath4712% @xcite .",

    "the simplest model is the `` single power law '' model .",
    "we assume that the astrophysical flux arrives isotropically from all directions , that its flavor - ratio at earth is @xmath53 , and that it can be described by a simple power law of the form    @xmath54    @xmath55 denotes the all - flavor neutrino flux , @xmath56 its value at 100  tev and @xmath57 the power law spectral index .",
    "the `` differential '' model is based on the same assumptions about isotropy and flavor composition , but models the astrophysical flux with nine independent basis functions , defined in nine logarithmically spaced energy intervals between 10  tev and 10  pev .",

    "we relax the assumption of isotropy and allow for two independent astrophysical neutrino fluxes , one from the northern and one from the southern hemisphere ( separated at declination @xmath60 ) , both following a spectrum as defined in equation  ( [ eq : flux ] ) .",
    "while this scenario might lack a good astrophysical motivation , it does allow us to describe the flux separately in two hemispheres that are affected by different detector - related systematic effects .",

    "we have therefore implemented one nuisance parameter for each search that varies the normalization of the residual muon background in that search only . since the muon background is negligible for the track - based analyses t1 and t2 , this amounts to a total of four muon background normalization parameters ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) .",

    "<S> evidence for an extraterrestrial flux of high - energy neutrinos has now been found in multiple searches with the icecube detector . </S>",
    "<S> the first solid evidence was provided by a search for neutrino events with deposited energies @xmath0  tev and interaction vertices inside the instrumented volume . </S>",
    "<S> recent analyses suggest that the extraterrestrial flux extends to lower energies and is also visible with throughgoing , @xmath1-induced tracks from the northern hemisphere . here , we combine the results from six different icecube searches for astrophysical neutrinos in a maximum - likelihood analysis . the combined event sample features high - statistics samples of shower - like and track - like events . the data are fit in up to three observables : energy , zenith angle and event topology . assuming the astrophysical neutrino flux to be isotropic and to consist of equal flavors at earth , the all - flavor spectrum with neutrino energies between 25  tev and 2.8  pev is well described by an unbroken power law with best - fit spectral index @xmath2 and a flux at 100  tev of @xmath3 . under the same assumptions , an unbroken power law with index @xmath4 is disfavored with a significance of 3.8  @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) with respect to the best fit . </S>",
    "<S> this significance is reduced to 2.1  @xmath5 ( @xmath7 ) if instead we compare the best fit to a spectrum with index @xmath4 that has an exponential cut - off at high energies . allowing the electron neutrino flux to deviate from the other two flavors </S>",
    "<S> , we find a @xmath8  fraction of @xmath9 at earth . </S>",
    "<S> the sole production of electron neutrinos , which would be characteristic of neutron - decay dominated sources , is rejected with a significance of 3.6  @xmath5 ( @xmath10 ) . </S>"
