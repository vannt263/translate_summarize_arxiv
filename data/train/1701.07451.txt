    "we consider the following curved sitnikov problem : two bodies of equal masses ( primaries ) move , under mutual gravity , on keplerian ellipses about their center of mass .",
    "a third , massless particle is confined to a circle passing through the center of mass of the primaries , denoted by @xmath1 , and perpendicular to the plane of motion of the primaries ; the second intersection point of the circle with that plane is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the massless particle moves under the gravitational influence of the primaries without affecting them .",
    "the dynamics of the massless particle has two equilibrium points , at @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we focus on the local dynamics near these two points , more precisely , on the dependence of the linear stability of these points on the parameters of the problem .",
    "when the keplerian ellipses are not too large or too small , @xmath1 is a local center and @xmath2 is a hyperbolic fixed point .",
    "when we increase the size of the keplerian ellipses , as the distance between @xmath2 and the closest ellipse approaches zero , then @xmath2 undergoes stability interchanges .",
    "that is , there exists a sequence of open , mutually disjoint intervals of values of the semi - major axis of the keplerian ellipses , such that , on each of these intervals the linearized stability of @xmath2 is strongly stable , and each complementary interval contains values where the linearized stability is not strongly stable , i.e. , it is either hyperbolic or parabolic .",
    "the length of these intervals approaches zero when the semi - major axis of the keplerian ellipses approaches the diameter of the circle on which the massless particle moves .",
    "this phenomenon is the main focus in the paper .",
    "it is stated in @xcite and suggested by numerical evidence @xcite that the linearized stability of the point @xmath1 also undergoes stability interchanges when the size of the binary is kept fixed and the eccentricity of the keplerian ellipses approaches @xmath3 .",
    "stability interchanges of the type described above are ubiquitous in systems of varying parameters ; they appear , for example , in the classical hill s equation and in the mathieu equation @xcite . to prove the occurrence of this phenomenon in our curved sitnikov problem , we first formulate a general result on stability interchanges for a general class of simple mechanical systems .",
    "more precisely , we consider the motion of two bodies  one massive and one massless  which are confined to a pair of curves and move under newtonian gravity .",
    "we let the distance between the two curves be controlled by some parameter @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the position of the infinitesimal particle that achieves the minimum distance between the curves is an equilibrium point .",
    "we show that , in the case when the minimum distance between the two curves approaches zero , corresponding to @xmath5 , there existence a sequence of mutually disjoint open intervals @xmath6 , whose lengths approach zero as @xmath7 , such that whenever @xmath8 the linearized stability of the equilibrium point is strongly stable , and each complementary interval contains values of @xmath4 where the linearized stability is not strongly stable . from this result",
    "we derive the above mentioned stability interchange result for the curved sitnikov problem .",
    "the curved sitnikov problem considered in this paper is an extension of the classical sitnikov problem described in section  [ classical_sitnikov ] ( also , see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when the radius of the circle approaches infinity , in the limit we obtain the classical sitnikov problem  the infinitesimal mass moves along the line perpendicular to the plane of the primaries and passing through the center of mass .",
    "the equilibrium point @xmath2 becomes the point at infinity and is of a degenerate hyperbolic type .",
    "thus , stability interchanges of @xmath2 represent a new phenomenon that we encounter in the curved sitnikov problem but not in the classical one .",
    "also in the last case , it is well known that for @xmath9 the classical sitnikov problem is integrable . in the case of the curved one",
    ", numerical evidence suggests that it is not ( see figure [ fig : poincare ] ) .    the motivation for considering the curved sitnikov problem resides in the @xmath0-body problem in spaces with constant curvature , and with models of planetary motions in binary star systems , as discussed in section  [ n_body_curvature ] .",
    "we recall here the classical sitnikov problem .",
    "two bodies ( primaries ) of equal masses @xmath10 move in a plane on keplerian ellipses of eccentricity @xmath11 about their center of mass , and a third , massless particle moves on a line perpendicular to the plane of the primaries and passing through their center of mass . by choosing the plane of the primaries the @xmath12-plane and the line on which the massless particle moves the @xmath13-axis , the equations of motion of the massless particle",
    "can be written , in appropriate units , as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the distance from the primaries to their center of mass given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the eccentric anomaly in the kepler problem . by normalizing the time we can assume that the period of the primaries is @xmath18 , and @xmath19 for small @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath9 , i.e. , the primaries move on a circular orbit and the dynamics of the massless particle is described by a 1-degree of freedom hamiltonian and so is integrable .",
    "depending on the energy level , one has the following types of solutions : an equilibrium solution , when the particle rests at the center of mass of the primaries ; periodic solutions around the center of mass ; escape orbits , either parabolic , that reach infinity with zero velocity , or hyperbolic , that reach infinity with positive velocity .    when @xmath20 , the differential equation is non - autonomous and the system is non - integrable .",
    "consider the case @xmath21 .",
    "the system also has bounded and unbounded orbits , as well as unbounded oscillatory orbits and capture orbits ( oscillatory orbits are those for which @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and capture orbits are those for which @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) . in his famous paper about the final evolutions in the three body problem , chazy introduced the term _ oscillatory motions _",
    "@xcite , although he did not find examples of these , leaving the question of their existence open .",
    "sitnikov s model yielded the first example of oscillatory motions @xcite .",
    "there are many relevant works on this problem , including @xcite .",
    "the curved sitnikov problem introduced in section  [ intro_confined ] is a modification of the classical problem when the massless particle moves on a circle rather than a line .",
    "here we regard the circle as a very simple restricted model of a space with constant curvature . in subsection  [ n_body_curvature ]",
    "we introduce and summarize some aspects of this problem .",
    "the @xmath0-body problem on spaces with constant curvature is a natural extension of the @xmath0-body problem in the euclidean space ; in either case the gravitational law considered is newtonian .",
    "the extension was first proposed independently by the founders of hyperbolic geometry , nikolai lobachevsky and jnos bolyai .",
    "it was subsequently studied in the late 19th , early 20th century , by serret , killing , lipschitz , liebmann , schering , etc .",
    "schrdinger developed a quantum mechanical analogue of the kepler problem on the two - sphere in 1940 .",
    "the interest in the problem was revived by kozlov , harin , borisov , mamaev , kilin , shchepetilov , vozmischeva , and others , in the 1990 s .",
    "a more recent surge of interest was stimulated by the works on relative equilibria in spaces with constant curvature ( both positive and negative ) by diacu , prez - chavela , santoprete , and others , starting in the 2010 s .",
    "see @xcite for a history of the problem and a comprehensive list of references .",
    "a distinctive aspect of the @xmath0-body problem on curved spaces is that the lack of ( galilean ) translational invariance results in the lack of center - of - mass and linear - momentum integrals .",
    "hence , the study of the motion can not be reduced to a barycentric coordinate system .    as a consequence , the two - body problem on a sphere can no longer be reduced to the corresponding problem of motion in a central potential field , as is the case for the kepler problem in the euclidean space . as it turns out ,",
    "the two - body problem on the sphere is not integrable @xcite .",
    "studying the three - body problem on spaces with curvature is also challenging . perhaps the simplest model is the restricted three - body problem on a circle .",
    "this was studied in @xcite .",
    "first , they consider the motion of the two primaries on the circle , which is integrable , collisions can be regularized , and all orbits can be classified into three different classes ( elliptic , hyperbolic , parabolic ) .",
    "then they consider the motion of the massless particle under the gravity of the primaries , when one or both primaries are at a fixed position .",
    "they obtain once again a complete classification of all orbits of the massless particle .    in this paper",
    "we take the ideas from above one step further , by considering the curved sitnikov problem , with the massless particle moving on a circle under the gravitational influence of two primaries that move on keplerian ellipses in a plane perpendicular to that circle . in the limit case ,",
    "when the primaries are identified with one point , that is when the primaries coalesce into a single body , the keplerian ellipses degenerate to a point , and the limit problem coincides with the two - body problem on a circle described above .    while the motivation of this work is theoretical , there are possible connections with the dynamics of planets in binary star systems .",
    "about 20 planets outside of the solar system have been confirmed to orbit about binary stars systems ; since more than half of the main sequence stars have at least one stellar companion , it is expected that a substantial fraction of planets form in binary stars systems .",
    "the orbital dynamics of such planets can vary widely , with some planets orbiting one star and some others orbiting both stars .",
    "some chaotic - like planetary orbits have also been observed , e.g. planet kepler-413b orbiting kepler-413 a and kepler-413 b in the constellation cygnus , which displays erratic precession .",
    "this planet s orbit is tilted away from the plane of binaries and deviating from kepler s laws .",
    "it is hypothesized that this tilt may be due to the gravitational influence of a third star nearby @xcite . of a related interest",
    "is the relativistic version of the sitnikov problem @xcite .",
    "thus , mathematical models like the one considered in this paper could be helpful to understand possible types of planetary orbits in binary stars systems .    to complete this introduction ,",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ curved ] we go deeper in the description of the curved sitnikov problem , studying the limit cases and its general properties . in section  [ general ]",
    "we present a general result on stability interchanges . in section  [ section_stability ]",
    "we show that the equilibrium points in the curved sitnikov problem present stability interchanges . finally ,",
    "in order to have a self contained paper , we add an appendix with general results ( without proofs ) from floquet theory .",
    "we consider two bodies with equal masses ( primaries ) moving under mutual newtonian gravity on identical elliptical orbits of eccentricity @xmath26 , about their center of mass . for small values of @xmath26 , the distance",
    "@xmath15 from either primary to the center of mass of the binary is given by @xmath27 where @xmath17 is the eccentric anomaly , which satisfies kepler s equation @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the mean motion of the primaries .",
    "the expansion in is convergent for @xmath30 ; see @xcite .",
    "a massless particle is confined on a circle of radius @xmath31 passing through the center of mass of the binary and perpendicular to the plane of its motion .",
    "we assume that the only force acting on the infinitesimal particle is the component along the circle of the resultant of the gravitational forces exerted by the primaries .",
    "the motion of the primaries take place in the @xmath12-coordinate plane and the circle with radius @xmath31 is in the @xmath32-coordinate plane .",
    "see figure [ problema ] .",
    "we place the center of mass at the point @xmath33 in the @xmath34-coordinate system .",
    "the position of the primaries are determined by the functions @xmath35 note that @xmath36 corresponds to the passage of the primaries through the pericenter at @xmath37 and @xmath38 to the passage of the primaries through the apocenter at @xmath39 ; both peri- and apo - centers lie on the plane of the circle of radius @xmath31 in the @xmath40-axis .",
    "the position of the infinitesimal particle is @xmath41 ( taking into account the restriction of motion for the infinitesimal particle to the circle @xmath42 ) .",
    "we will derive the equations of motion by computing the gravitational forces exerted by the primaries : @xmath43 where the distance from the particle to each primary is @xmath44^{1/2},\\\\       ||\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_{2}||=\\left[r^{2}_{\\varepsilon}(t;r ) + 2r^{2}-2rr_{\\varepsilon}(t;r)\\cos t -2y(r - r_{\\varepsilon}(t;r)\\cos t ) \\right]^{1/2}.",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we note that when @xmath45 the elliptical orbit of the primary with the apo - center at @xmath46 crosses the circle of radius @xmath31 , hence collisions between the primary and the infinitesimal mass are possible",
    ". therefore we will restrict to @xmath47 ; when @xmath48 , this means @xmath49 .",
    "we write ( [ fuerza ] ) in polar coordinates , that is @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and we obtain @xmath52    the origin @xmath53 corresponds to the point @xmath33 in the @xmath34-coordinate system .",
    "thus , the primaries move on elliptical orbits around this point",
    ".    next we will retain the component along the circle of the resulting force ( [ fuerzaangulo ] ) .",
    "that is , we will ignore the constraint force that confines the motion of the particle to the circle , as this force acts perpendicularly to the tangential component of the gravitational attraction force . the unit tangent vector to the circle of radius @xmath31 at @xmath54 pointing in the positive direction",
    "is given by @xmath55 .",
    "the component of the force @xmath56 along the circle is computed as @xmath57    the motion of the particle , as a hamiltonian system of one - and - a - half degrees of freedom , corresponds to @xmath58 where @xmath59^{1/2}\\,,\\\\       ||\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_{2}||&=&\\left [ r^{2}_{\\varepsilon}(t;r )       + 2r(1-\\cos   q)(r - r_{\\varepsilon}(t;r)\\cos t)\\right]^{1/2}\\ , ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hence @xmath60 where the potential is given by @xmath61      the curved sitnikov problem can be viewed as a link between the classical sitnikov problem and the kepler problem on the circle , mentioned in section  [ sec : introduction ] .",

    "when we take the limit @xmath67 in ( [ fuerzaangulorestringida ] ) we are fusing the primaries into a large mass at the center of mass and we obtain a two - body problem on the circle .",
    "the component force along the circle corresponds to @xmath68 this problem was studied in @xcite with a different force given by @xmath69 the distance between the large mass and the particle is measured by the arc length ( in that paper the authors assume that @xmath70 ) .",
    "the potential of the force ( [ eq : a1 ] ) is @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the angular coordinate , and the potential for ( [ eq : a2 ] ) is @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the angular coordinate .",

    "let @xmath79 be the flow of the hamiltonian @xmath80 , and let @xmath81 denote the phase space , @xmath82    using that all orbits are determined by the energy relations given by ( [ energia ] ) , it is not difficult to define a homeomorphism @xmath83 which maps orbits of system ( [ eq : a1 ] ) into orbits of system ( [ eq : a2 ] ) . in the same way we can define a homeomorphism @xmath84 which in fact is @xmath85 .",
    "this shows the @xmath86 equivalence of the respective flows .",
    "one can show that the two corresponding flows are @xmath86equivalent .",
    "we recall from @xcite that the solutions of the two - body problem on the circle ( apart from the equilibrium antipodal to the fixed body ) are classified in three families ( elliptic , parabolic and hyperbolic solutions ) according to their energy level .",
    "the elliptic solutions come out of a collision , stop instantaneously , and reverse their path back to the collision with the fixed body .",
    "the parabolic solutions come out of a collision and approach the equilibrium as @xmath87 .",
