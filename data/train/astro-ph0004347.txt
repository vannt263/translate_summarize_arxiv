    "this has been confirmed for one system , the @xmath30 hz accreting pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ; chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) , in which the neutron star magnetic field ( @xmath31@xmath32 ; psaltis & chakrabarty 1999 ) channels the accretion flow onto the magnetic polar caps , creating an asymmetry which is modulated by rotation .",
    "however , most neutron stars in lmxb s show no evidence for coherent periodicity in the persistent emission , implying that the neutron stars do not possess magnetic fields strong enough to make a permanent asymmetry ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "type i x - ray bursts have provided a new way to determine the spin of these neutron stars .",
    "observations with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ of neutron stars in six lmxbs have shown coherent oscillations during type i x - ray bursts , with frequencies @xmath34 that range from 300 to 600 hz ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that the burning is not spherically symmetric , providing a temporary asymmetry on the neutron star that allows for a direct measurement of rotation .",
    "the coherent nature of the periodicities ( @xmath35 ) , large modulation amplitudes and stability of the frequency over at least a year support its interpretation as the neutron star spin ( strohmayer 1999b , and references therein ) .",
    "it is expected theoretically that the burning should not be spherically symmetric .",
    "joss ( 1978 ) and shara ( 1982 ) suggested that ignition of a burst occurs at a local spot on the star , and not simultaneously over the whole surface .",
    "this is because it takes hours to days to accumulate the fuel , but only a few seconds for the thermal instability to grow .",
    "simultaneous ignition thus requires synchronization of the thermal state of the accreted envelope to one part in @xmath36@xmath37 over the surface .",
    "more likely is that ignition is local and a burning front then spreads laterally ( fryxell & woosley 1982 ; nozakura , ikeuchi , & fujimoto 1984 ; bildsten 1995 ) , burning the rest of the accreted fuel and creating a temporary brightness asymmetry on the neutron star surface ( schoelkopf & kelley 1991 ; bildsten 1995 ) .",
    "consistent with the picture of a spreading burning front , the pulsation amplitude is observed to decrease during the burst rise while the emitting area increases , reaching a constant value during the decay ( strohmayer , zhang & swank 1997b ; strohmayer et al .",
    "1998c ) .",
    "the oscillations during the burst rise are well - explained by the picture of a spreading hotspot .",
    "however , several mysteries remain .",
    "first , oscillations are often seen in the burst tail , when the whole surface of the star has presumably ignited .",
    "the cause of the azimuthal asymmetry at late times is not understood .",
    "secondly , for those objects with @xmath38 in table [ tab : obs ] , there is evidence that the burst oscillation frequency is twice the spin frequency of the star , including observations of a @xmath39 subharmonic ( miller 1999 ) and the fact that the khz qpo separation is approximately half the burst oscillation frequency in these sources ( see van der klis 2000 for a review ) .",
    "what might cause an @xmath40 azimuthal asymmetry is unknown .",
    "third , oscillations are not seen in all sources , or all type i bursts from the same source .    an initially puzzling feature of the observations was that the oscillation frequency often changes during the burst , increasing by @xmath41@xmath42 hz in the burst tail .",
    "strohmayer et al . ( 1997a ) proposed a simple explanation  that this frequency shift results from angular momentum conservation .",
    "the slight hydrostatic radial expansion ( contraction ) of the burning layers as the temperature increases ( decreases ) results in spin down ( spin up ) if angular momentum is conserved .",
    "the time for radial heat transport from the burning layers to the photosphere is about one second , which means that the layers are puffed up and spun down by the time the observer sees the burst . as the burning layers cool during the tail of the burst , they contract and spin up .",
    "strohmayer & markwardt ( 1999 ) and miller ( 1999 , 2000 ) have modelled the observed frequency evolution .",
    "they find that , in the evolving frame of the burning shell , the oscillations are coherent , as expected if they are due to rotation .",
    "calculations show that the change in thickness of the burning layers during a burst is @xmath43 ( hanawa & fujimoto 1984 ; ayasli & joss 1982 ; bildsten 1998 ) .",
    "a simple estimate of the spin down of the burning shell due to this change in thickness is then @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the neutron star radius and @xmath46 the spin frequency .",
    "this roughly agrees with the observed values ( table [ tab : obs ] ) .    in this paper , we make a first attempt at understanding the evolution of the neutron star atmosphere during a type i x - ray burst on a rotating neutron star .",
    "we use hydrostatic models of the neutron star atmosphere to calculate the expansion and resulting spin evolution during a burst .",
    "our aim is to investigate whether the observed frequency changes during bursts are consistent with spin down of the burning shell , thus lending support to the interpretation that the burst oscillation frequency is intimately related to the neutron star spin .",
    "this simple picture demands that the hot burning material decouples from the cooler underlying ashes and conserves its angular momentum , completing a few phase wraps with the underlying star during the burst .",
    "we thus examine mechanisms that might couple the burning layers to the neutron star , and ask whether it is plausible that the burning layers can remain decoupled for the @xmath47 duration of the burst .    we stress that we consider only one - dimensional models for these hydrostatic and coupling calculations .",
    "we do not consider the complex question of how the burning front spreads around the star during the burst rise , what determines the number of hotspots on the surface , or what causes the asymmetry at late times during the cooling tail of the burst .",
    "we leave these questions for future investigations .",
    "we start in  2 by describing the hydrostatic structure of the atmosphere during fuel accumulation and the x - ray burst . in  3 , we calculate the expansion of the atmosphere and show that the expected spin down of a decoupled layer is consistent with observed values .",
    "we consider heat transport through the atmosphere , and ask how a single coherent frequency is transmitted to the observer . in  4 , we discuss hydrodynamic mechanisms that could transport angular momentum within the burning layers or couple the hot burning material to the underlying colder and denser ashes . in  5 , we summarize our results and discuss the many remaining puzzles . finally , we present our conclusions in  6 .",

    "@xmath49 ( see bildsten 1998 and references therein ) , the accumulating hydrogen is thermally stable and burns via the hot cno cycle of hoyle & fowler ( 1965 ) .",
    "the temperature of most of the atmosphere is @xmath50 so that the time for a proton capture onto a @xmath51n nucleus is less than the time for the subsequent beta - decays .",
    "this fixes the energy production rate at the value @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mass fraction of cno nuclei .",
    "this energy production rate is independent of temperature or density , and simply set by the beta - decay timescales of @xmath51o ( half - life 71 s ) and @xmath54o ( half - life 122 s ) . because the hydrogen burns at a constant rate , the time to burn all of it depends only on the metallicity and initial hydrogen abundance .",

    "the time to burn all the hydrogen is then @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the initial hydrogen mass fraction .",
    "the x - ray burst is triggered when helium burning becomes unstable at the base of the accumulated layer , at a density @xmath60@xmath61 and temperature @xmath62 .",
    "the composition at the base of the layer depends on how much hydrogen has burned during the accumulation ( fujimoto , hanawa & miyaji 1981 , hereafter fhm ; bildsten 1998 ) , which is determined by the local accretion rate , @xmath63 .",
    "the local eddington accretion rate is @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the thomson scattering cross - section , @xmath66 is the proton mass , @xmath67 is the speed of light , and @xmath45 is the stellar radius . in this paper , we use the eddington accretion rate for solar composition ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath69  km , @xmath70 , as our basic unit for the local accretion rate ( for a 10 km neutron star , this corresponds to a global rate @xmath71 ) . for @xmath72 ,",

    "a radiative layer is always needed to transport the heat to the photosphere .",

    "we have shown that the atmosphere expands outwards by @xmath215@xmath233 ( @xmath234@xmath235 ) during a mixed h / he ( pure he ) burst . in this section ,",
    "we first calculate how the spin of the burning layers evolves during the burst , assuming they conserve angular momentum as they hydrostatically expand and contract , and that they remain decoupled from the bulk of the neutron star (  3.13.3 ) . in  [ sec : heattrans ] , we point out ( in agreement with miller 2000 ) that for the observer to see a coherent oscillation requires either a mechanism to enforce rigid rotation of the burning layers ( such as convection ) , or that the burning layers be geometrically thin . in addition , we consider the heat propagation through the radiative layers to the surface , and discuss how this can `` wash - out '' any coherent pulse emanating from deeper layers .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : radiusexp ] by discussing what happens during radius expansion bursts .",
    "we assume that the action of hydrodynamic instabilites ( fujimoto 1988 , 1993 ) or a weak poloidal magnetic field will force the accumulating pile of fuel to be rigidly rotating with the spin frequency of the star , @xmath236 .",
    "the time for angular momentum to diffuse across a scale height @xmath237 due to molecular viscosity @xmath238 alone is @xmath239 . in  5 ,",
    "we show that this time is @xmath240 for @xmath241 , comparable to the time between bursts .",
    "thus , even microphysical mechanisms might bring the accumulated fuel into corotation .",
    "we further assume that the burning is spherically symmetric , ignoring the complicated , and important , question of how the burning spreads over the stellar surface , and the fact that some asymmetry is needed to give an observable oscillation .",
    "thus we assume the angular velocity is constant on spherical shells , and depends on radius only .",
    "this remains true as the atmosphere expands , since a rigidly rotating spherical shell stays rigidly rotating as it expands outwards ( because the fractional change in the distance from the rotation axis is the same for all latitudes ) .",
    "conservation of angular momentum demands that @xmath242 remains constant as a fluid element expands outwards , giving the spin frequency as a function of column depth during the burst @xmath243 where @xmath244 ( @xmath245 ) is the height of column @xmath78 above the base before ( during ) the burst .",
    "we take the base at @xmath104 to be at fixed radius @xmath45 , even though the old ashes below heat up and expand a little .",
    "we ignore the general relativistic corrections to the frequency shift , which strohmayer ( 1999a ) estimates are a @xmath24610%20% effect .",
    "equation ( [ eq : omegarad ] ) shows that the spin frequency depends on depth in the radiative layers .",
    "the picture is different in a convective zone .",
    "we expect the convective motions will rapidly bring the convection zone into rigid rotation , since the convective turnover time is very short ( @xmath247 ) .",
    "thus , if there is no angular momentum transport between the convective zone and neighboring layers , the spin frequency of the convective zone is @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the total moment of inertia of the material between @xmath178 and @xmath104 before the ignition , and @xmath250 is the moment of inertia of the convection zone .",
    "we calculate the moment of inertia as follows . a spherical shell at radius @xmath251 , mass @xmath252 has a moment of inertia @xmath253 , where the @xmath254 comes from integrating over angles . since @xmath255 ,",

    "we derive a simple analytic estimate of the moment of inertia of the convective zone , by assuming @xmath262 is constant , so that @xmath263 is given by an equation similar to equation ( [ eq : zp ] ) . inserting this into equation ( [ eq : i ] ) ,",

    "the moment of inertia has two pieces .",
    "the zeroth order piece , @xmath268 is the moment of inertia of mass @xmath269 concentrated at radius @xmath45 .",
    "the second term is the @xmath270 correction to this because the envelope is extended .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ic ] ) reproduces the numerical results to a few percent .",
    "the lower panels of figure [ fig : convectfig ] show @xmath271 as a function of column depth for the different convective models in table [ tab : conv ] .",
    "we define @xmath272 so that a positive value means that the layers have spun down .",
    "figure [ fig : noconvectfig ] shows @xmath273 for the fully radiative models of table [ tab : noconv ] .",
    "the values of @xmath272 that we find are similar to the observed frequency shifts during bursts ( table 1 ) . as we described above , in radiative zones the spin down depends on height , whereas convective zones are rigidly rotating . in the convective models ,",
    "this gives rise to jumps in @xmath272 at the boundaries between the convection zone and both the underlying ashes and the overlying radiative layer .",
    "for both convective and fully - radiative models , the @xmath273 is smaller by roughly a factor of two for pure he ignition as opposed to mixed h / he ignition .",
    "this is because the pure he models expand outwards less , as we discussed in  2.2 .      as we described in ",
    "[ sec : convmodels ] , the atmosphere does not remain convective for the whole duration of the burst .",
    "eventually , the convection zone shrinks back .",
    "what is the profile of @xmath272 left by the retreating convection zone ?",
    "imagine that the convection zone retreats by an amount @xmath274 ( so the top of the convection zone moves from column @xmath178 to @xmath275 ) .",
    "the material which decouples from the convection zone takes away an amount of angular momentum given by @xmath276 , where @xmath277 is the spin frequency of the convection zone , and @xmath194 is the height of the top of the convection zone above the base .",
    "the loss of angular momentum from the convection zone must be compensated by a change in its spin or moment of inertia @xmath278 .",
    "dividing by @xmath279 , and changing variables to @xmath266 , we obtain the differential equation depends on both @xmath280 and @xmath281 , one can write @xmath282 .",
    "in fact , the first term in equation ( [ eq : shrink ] ) exactly cancels the @xmath283 piece of the second term , giving @xmath284 .",
    "thus if the convection zone shrank at fixed @xmath280 , it would not change its spin frequency because the angular momentum taken away by the decoupled fluid exactly cancels the change in the moment of inertia due to the change in @xmath281 . ]",
    "@xmath285.\\ ] ] we integrate this equation from the starting values of @xmath277 and @xmath281 , towards @xmath286 as the convection zone vanishes .",
    "there is one difficulty , however , which is that @xmath194 and @xmath250 are functions of not only @xmath281 but also the scale height at the base @xmath280 .",
    "if we assume the composition @xmath100 does not change , then @xmath280 only depends on @xmath167 .",
    "we model @xmath287 as follows , @xmath288 where @xmath289 is the final temperature after the convection vanishes ( @xmath286 ) , @xmath290 is the initial temperature at the base of the convection zone , and @xmath291 is the initial value of @xmath281 . in reality , @xmath281 is determined by the instantaneous values of @xmath95 and @xmath167 , so if we knew @xmath292 we could map this onto @xmath287 .",
    "instead , we specify @xmath287 then as a check that our choice is reasonable , we can compute @xmath292 .",
    "figure [ fig : shrink ] shows the results for the model with @xmath293 , @xmath143 ( mixed h / he ignition ) , with initial extent of the convective zone @xmath294 , and base temperature @xmath295 .",
    "as the convection zone retreats , we assume the base temperature falls to @xmath296 .",
    "we show @xmath272 profiles for the initial model ( 80% of mass convective ) , an intermediate case ( 50% ) and when the convective zone has almost vanished ( 5% ) .",
    "these models have @xmath297 and @xmath298 and @xmath299 and @xmath300 respectively .",
    "the jumps in @xmath272 at the top and base of the convection zone persist as it shrinks .",
    "in addition , the matter that becomes radiative spins up as the physical thickness of the underlying convection zone decreases .",
    "this gives rise to an inversion in @xmath272 , as shown in figure [ fig : shrink ] .",
    "one might worry that such an inverted profile would be unstable to axisymmetric perturbations . however , all the profiles in figure [ fig : shrink ] have increasing specific angular momentum with radius .",
    "in addition , the brunt - visl frequency is so large , @xmath301 (  [ sec : kh ] ) , that we expect the solberg - hoiland criterion for stability ( see e.g. endal & sofia 1978 ) will always be satisfied .",
    "as the atmosphere cools in the tail of a burst , its thickness decreases , and it spins back up .",
    "we compute simple models of the cooling atmosphere by assuming it carries a constant flux and has a fixed uniform composition . in figure",
    "[ fig : cool ] we show the thickness @xmath22890%@xmath139 as a function of the flux @xmath302 .",
    "the solid curve is for the @xmath303 , @xmath143 mixed h / he ignition model , for which we assume a composition of @xmath304kr , since the rp process makes elements beyond the iron group ( schatz et al .",

    "the dashed lines are for pure he ignitions , with @xmath143 , @xmath305 ( upper curve ) and @xmath306 ( lower curve ) , and for a composition @xmath307ni . in each case , we show @xmath308%@xmath139 just before ignition by a horizontal solid line .",
    "figure [ fig : cool ] shows that in the limit @xmath309 , the thickness of the ashes is about half the pre - burst thickness for mixed h / he ignition , but similar to the pre - burst thickness for pure he ignition .",
    "this is because electrons ( which provide most of the pressure support ) are consumed in hydrogen burning , but not during helium burning . in the tail of a burst ,",
    "when , for example @xmath310 , the thickness of the atmosphere is @xmath311 different from the pre - burst thickness in both cases .",
    "thus if the burning layers remain decoupled as they cool , we expect the spin frequency in the tail to be different from the stellar spin by a part in @xmath312 .",
    "we discuss the implications of this result in  [ sec : recouple ] .",
    "we now turn to the vertical transport of heat , and its effect on the coherence and amplitude of the burst oscillations .",
    "figures [ fig : convectfig ] and [ fig : noconvectfig ] show that in a radiative zone the magnitude of the spin down depends on depth .",
    "however , a single coherent frequency is observed during bursts .",
    "this implies that either convection or some other mechanism ( see  [ sec : coupling ] ) is enforcing rigid rotation in the burning region , or , as pointed out by miller ( 2000 ) , the burning layers must be geometrically thin . since the fractional change in spin across a height @xmath313 in a radiative zone is @xmath314 , an observed coherence @xmath315 demands a burning layer thickness @xmath316 .",
    "strohmayer & markwardt ( 1999 ) found @xmath317 for bursts from 4u 1728 - 34 and 4u 1702 - 43 when the observed frequency evolution was accounted for , while muno et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found @xmath318 for burst oscillations from ks 1731 - 26 .",
    "these results imply a burning region thickness @xmath319 .",
    "this is perhaps more likely for pure he bursts , because of the temperature sensitivity of he burning reactions .    also important",
    "is heat transport across the differentially - rotating atmosphere .",
    "the time for radial heat transport from the burning layers to the photosphere can be estimated from the entropy equation , @xmath320 , together with equation ( [ eq : heat ] ) for the flux @xmath95 , which gives a timescale @xmath321 . in our numerical calculations ,",
    "we calculate the heat capacity at constant pressure @xmath98 exactly .",
    "we make an analytic estimate for a mixture of ideal gas and radiation using @xmath322 where @xmath323 ( clayton 1983 ) , giving @xmath324 the factor @xmath325 is unity for @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) and grows increasingly larger as @xmath115 approaches zero ( @xmath202 ) , for example @xmath326 whereas @xmath327 ( this is because the internal energy of a photon gas at constant pressure is independent of temperature ) .",
    "thus at a fixed pressure , the thermal time first decreases with increasing temperature ( since @xmath328 ) but starts increasing again once radiation pressure becomes important .    equation ( [ eq : ttherm ] ) shows that the thermal time ( @xmath329 ) is much longer than the time for hydrostatic readjustment ( @xmath330 ) , explaining why spin down is not seen in the beginning of a burst . by the time the heat released by nuclear burning reaches the observer ,",
    "the layers have expanded and spun down .",
    "the burning layers revolve around the underlying star in a time @xmath331 , comparable to the thermal time .",
    "the ratio of the shearing time to the thermal time is important .",
    "if the heat diffuses quickly , @xmath332 , the atmosphere simply transmits the burning pattern from below , much like passing a flashlight behind a piece of paper .",

[ [ eq : ttherm ] ] ) is less important .",
    "figure [ fig : therm ] shows that the mixed h / he ignition bursts have @xmath338 , whereas the pure he ignition bursts have @xmath339 .",
    "this is because both the spin down and thermal time are less for the pure helium bursts ( @xmath340 and @xmath341 ) . as we discuss further in ",
    "[ sec : muno ] , figure [ fig : therm ] may explain the lack of burst oscillations seen in bursts with the characteristics of mixed h / he ignition .",
    "for these mixed h / he ignition bursts , @xmath338 and any oscillations in the flux from deeper regions can get washed out .",
    "many of the bursts which have shown oscillations are radius expansion bursts ( table [ tab : obs ] ) , in which super - eddington luminosities result in expansion of the photosphere to radii @xmath342@xmath343 ( for a review see lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1993 ) .",
    "burst oscillations have not been observed during the peak of radius expansion bursts , but are sometimes seen during the burst rise , and often during the tail of the burst , once the photosphere has fallen back to the stellar radius @xmath45 ( for an example , see figure 2 of strohmayer et al . 1998c which shows a radius expansion burst from 4u 1636 - 54 ) .",
    "we did not model radius expansion in  [ sec : expansion ]",
    ". however , several of our models have super - eddington fluxes , and thus are appropriate for the early stages of these bursts . because the opacity deep in the atmosphere",
    "is smaller than at the photosphere , the hydrostatic structure we calculate breaks down only in the very upper layers near the photosphere .",
    "our radiative models are also appropriate for the cooling tail of these bursts , when the photosphere has fallen back to the stellar surface .",
    "whatever the cause of the asymmetry on the neutron star surface , the fact that oscillations are not seen during the peak of radius expansion bursts is as we would expect , given the discussion of  [ sec : heattrans ] .",
    "the long thermal time across the extended envelope during radius expansion ( paczynski & anderson 1986 ) , as well as the fact that the horizontal and vertical lengthscales are similar , will hide any asymmetry and wash out the oscillation .",
    "we have shown that if different layers of the atmosphere conserve their angular momentum , expansion during the burst results in differential rotation within the burning layers .",
    "thus as we noted in ",
    "[ sec : heattrans ] , the fact that a single coherent frequency is observed implies that either the burning layers are geometrically thin , or that they must rotate rigidly . while convection may enforce rigid rotation in the early stages of a burst , we do not expect the atmosphere to be convective in the cooling tail ( see  [ sec : burstmodels ] ) . in this section",
    ", we investigate mechanisms which might transport angular momentum between the differentially - rotating burning layers .",

    "as suggested by bildsten ( 1998 ) , the strong buoyancy in the atmosphere gives @xmath363 .",
    "thus we do not expect the kelvin - helmholtz instability to operate either within the burning layers or between the burning layer and the underlying ashes .",
    "we now investigate how fast viscosity acts to smooth out differential rotation .",
    "the molecular viscosity in the atmosphere is determined by ion - ion collisions , giving @xmath364 ( spitzer 1962 ) , where @xmath365 , @xmath366 and @xmath367 is the coulomb logarithm .",

    "detailed calculations are needed to find whether ekman pumping operates during the burst .",
    "the baroclinic instability is a hydrodynamic instability in which the fluid motions are close to horizontal , so it occurs even when the richardson number is large .",
    "it has been well - studied in geophysics ( pedlosky 1987 ) and in astrophysics because of its possible role in angular momentum transport in stellar interiors ( knobloch & spruit 1982 ; tassoul & tassoul 1982 ; spruit & knobloch 1984 ) and accreting compact objects ( fujimoto 1988 , 1993 ) .",
    "we start by showing that in the presence of a vertical shear , the surfaces of constant pressure and density are inclined with respect to each other .",
    "this represents a store of gravitational energy which the baroclinic instability can tap .",
    "we then present the results of a stability analysis of a plane - parallel model , for which we find that the strong buoyancy limits the baroclinic instability to short vertical wavelengths ( @xmath379 ) .",
    "we first study the misalignment of the constant density and pressure surfaces that arises in the presence of vertical shear on a rotating star .",
    "this result is well - known on the earth , where differential heating between the equator and pole gives rise to the `` thermal wind '' ( pedlosky 1987 ) . to investigate recoupling of the ashes and burning layers , we adopt a simple `` two layer '' model ,",
    "in which we include only the buoyancy associated with the interface between the ashes and the burning layers .",
    "thus , we take the upper ( lower ) layer to have constant density @xmath380 ( @xmath381 ) .",
    "both layers are in hydrostatic balance in the vertical direction .",
    "as elsewhere in this paper , we assume the burning front has spread over the whole surface .",
    "we work in the rotating frame , in which the lower fluid is stationary .",
    "we assume the upper layer is rigidly rotating with angular velocity @xmath382 ( so that @xmath383 is positive for a spun down shell ) .",
    "since it is moving , the upper fluid feels a coriolis force in the transverse direction . in a time @xmath384 ,",
    "a transverse pressure gradient will be established which balances the coriolis force ( geostrophic balance ) . however , in the lower fluid there is no transverse pressure gradient ( it feels no coriolis force ) . since the pressure must be continuous across the boundary , it can not be horizontal , but must slope .",
    "figure [ fig : slope](a ) illustrates this .",
    "we show a small section of the two layers at latitude @xmath385 ( @xmath385 is the angle from the pole ) in the @xmath386 plane .",

    "we adopt coordinates @xmath388 and @xmath78 perpendicular and parallel to surfaces of constant pressure ( dotted line ) .",
    "the vertical component of the rotation vector is @xmath389 , and the upper fluid is moving out of the page with velocity @xmath390 .",

    "first we move through the lower fluid along the dashed line , horizontally a distance @xmath391 , then vertically upwards a distance @xmath392 .",
    "the pressure change along this path is @xmath393 .",

    "any displacement within the so - called `` wedge of instability '' ( pedlosky 1987 ) is convectively unstable in this way .",
    "we have carried out a linear stability analysis of a plane parallel two - layer model .",
    "we do not present our detailed calculations , rather we summarize our results and use simple physical arguments to understand them .",

    "we write the fluid displacement as ( @xmath420,@xmath421,@xmath422 ) , and look for solutions @xmath423 where @xmath424 and @xmath425 are the transverse wavenumbers , and @xmath426 is the growth rate .",
    "pedlosky ( 1987 ) performs a similar analysis , although restricted to the case @xmath427 .",
    "we find that small wavelengths are stable because the fluid displacements lie outside the wedge of instability .",
    "to see this , assume that the perturbations are in geostrophic balance , in which case the continuity equation gives @xmath428 , where @xmath429 is the rossby number of the perturbation , and the transverse wavelength @xmath430 , with @xmath431 .",
    "then the angle of fluid displacement is @xmath432 , where the vertical wavelength is set by the vertical extent of the burning layers @xmath433 . for instability",
    ", the angle of fluid displacement should be less than the slope of the interface ( eq . [ [ eq : slope ] ] ) , requiring @xmath434 , or @xmath435 where we insert the correct prefactor .",
    "thus the nearly horizontal unstable displacements require transverse wavelengths of order the stellar radius or greater .",
    "however , very large transverse wavelength perturbations can be stabilized because the vertical component of @xmath374 changes significantly across a wavelength .",
    "the changing vorticity provides a restoring force in the @xmath385 direction ( pedlosky 1987 ) .",
    "this is the same force which supports rossby waves ( pedlosky 1987 ; brekhovskikh & goncharov 1994 ; dutton 1995 ) .",
    "we find that the convective instability overcomes the rossby wave restoring force when the shear velocity is greater than the rossby wave speed , @xmath436 ( see also pedlosky 1987 ) .",
    "thus we require @xmath437 , or @xmath438 for instability , where we insert the correct prefactor .",
    "transverse wavelengths which satisfy equation ( [ eq : lambdabc ] ) do not satisfy equation ( [ eq : lambdaro ] ) .",
    "thus in the context of our plane - parallel model , we conclude that , when @xmath439 , large scale mixing between the burning layers and ashes by the baroclinic instability does not occur .",
    "instability can occur when @xmath440 , or @xmath441 .",
    "since @xmath442 , this is @xmath443 so mixing may occur as the burning layers cool and the density contrast with the ashes decreases .",
    "the growth rate of an unstable mode is @xmath444 , so that writing @xmath445 ( so that @xmath446 ) , we estimate the fastest growing modes will have @xmath447 ) .",
    "several authors have studied two layer models on a sphere ( hollingsworth 1975 ; hollingsworth , simmons & hoskins 1976 ; simmons & hoskins 1976 , 1977 ; moura & stone 1976 ; warn 1976 ) , but for parameters of interest for the earth , namely @xmath427 and @xmath448 .",
    "they find good agreement with growth rates calculated with beta - plane models . however , further calculations are needed to extend our analysis to the spherical case , and determine the spherical eigenfunctions and growth rates .",
    "so far we have considered only vertical wavelengths @xmath433 , because of the simple vertical structure of the two layer model . however ,",
    "if we allow perturbations with @xmath449 , we expect to find instability for small enough vertical wavelengths .",
    "this is because for small vertical wavelengths , the fluid displacement is able to lie within the wedge of instability ( figure [ fig : slope ] ) while still having a transverse wavelength which is unaffected by rossy wave restoring forces ( eq . [ [ eq : lambdaro ] ] ) .",
    "we make a simple estimate of the vertical wavelength at which instability occurs by repeating the arguments leading to equation ( [ eq : lambdabc ] ) , but this time allowing @xmath450 . in this case , @xmath451 is given by equation ( [ eq : lambdabc ] ) with @xmath280 replaced by @xmath452 . for instability ,",
    "we require @xmath440 ( eq . [ [ eq : lambdaro ] ] ) giving @xmath453 where we take @xmath402 and @xmath403 .",
    "we expect modes with vertical wavelengths small enough to satisfy equation ( [ eq : lambdaz ] ) to be unstable .",
    "fujimoto ( 1988 , 1993 ) used the short wavelength baroclinic modes to define a turbulent viscosity @xmath454 where the growth time of the instability is @xmath455 , or @xmath456 ( pedlosky 1987 ; fujimoto 1988 ) . the time to transport angular momentum across a scale height is @xmath457 , or @xmath458 thus turbulent transport of angular momentum driven by the short wavelength baroclinic modes could be important during a burst . in particular , these could act to force the burning shell to rigidly rotate .",
    "the majority of neutron stars in lmxbs show no evidence for coherent pulsations in their persistent emission .",
    "this implies that these neutron stars are weakly magnetic ( @xmath459 ) so the accretion flow is likely not disrupted before it reaches the neutron star surface .",
    "we now ask what effect would a weak magnetic field have on the shearing atmosphere during a burst ?",
    "the ohmic diffusion time across a scale height is @xmath460 , or @xmath461 ( brown & bildsten 1998 ) where we estimate the conductivity as @xmath462 ( spitzer 1962 ) , @xmath463 is the mean ionic charge and @xmath367 is the coulomb logarithm . since @xmath464 ,",
    "the mhd limit applies during the burst and the shearing atmosphere will bend the magnetic field lines . an initially poloidal magnetic field would prevent the shearing if the energy density in the field is greater than the shear energy , @xmath465 , or @xmath466 this is a similar limit to those from lack of persistent pulsations and from spectral modelling ( psaltis & lamb 1998 ) .",
    "the observed shearing for ten seconds most likely rules out fields this strong .",
    "what can we say about a weaker , initially poloidal field like that often discussed for the the progenitors of millisecond pulsars , @xmath467 ?",
    "fields this weak can also have a significant effect when in the ideal mhd limit .",
    "in this case , the horizontal shearing and dragging of the field lines generates a strong toroidal field .",
    "spruit ( 1999 ) recently considered the interaction of magnetic fields and differential rotation in stellar interiors .",
    "he considered an initially poloidal field @xmath468 , and showed that @xmath469 grows with time according to @xmath470 where @xmath346 is the number of windings , @xmath471 .",
    "we have @xmath472 , giving @xmath473 .",
    "thus we find @xmath474 after only a few revolutions of the star , much less than the wrap around time of the shear ( @xmath475 ) .",
    "the toroidal field grows so quickly because the field is sheared on a vertical scale @xmath476 .",
    "another way to see this is to consider a vertical tube of fluid in the shearing region ( with height @xmath237 and cross - section area @xmath477 ) that encloses a magnetic flux @xmath478 .",
    "after one differential wrapping time ( roughly one second ) , this fluid element will be stretched into a very thin tube of length @xmath479 and so will have shrunk in cross - sectional area to @xmath480 . if flux - freezing holds , then after one second , @xmath481 .",
    "this simple argument says that an initial field of @xmath482 can become dynamically important during the burst . however , further theoretical investigations are needed to see if the implied wrapping of the field is possible without instabilities setting in .",
    "if correct , this result implies that the bursters with frequency drift have magnetic fields much weaker than the @xmath483@xmath484 fields usually assumed .",
    "we have investigated a number of different mechanisms that could enforce rigid rotation within the burning layers , or act to couple the burning layers to the underlying ashes .",
    "we find that the strong buoyancy of the atmosphere prohibits the kelvin - helmholtz instability and mixing between the ashes and the burning layers by the baroclinic instability .",
    "short vertical wavelength baroclinic modes within the burning region may be unstable and vigorous enough to force the burning layers to rigidly rotate .",
    "the timescale for viscosity to act via an ekman pumping mechanism may be a few seconds or less ( eq . [ [ eq : ekman ] ] ) , but the effect of buoyancy , in particular from the composition gradients , is not clear .",
    "finally , our initial estimates suggest that winding of a weak magnetic field by the differential rotation is important during the burst .    in summary",
    ", we have not found a robust hydrodynamical mechanism that recouples the burning layers to the star during the @xmath485 burst duration .",
    "it thus seems plausible that the burning layers remain decoupled throughout the burst .",
    "short wavelength baroclinic instabilities may operate within the burning layers , although more work is needed to see whether they cause the burning shell to rigidly rotate .",
    "we now summarize the hydrostatic expansion of the atmosphere during a type i x - ray burst , and the implied spin evolution of the decoupled burning layers .",
    "we find the expected spin changes are of the same order as the observed frequency drifts , thus supporting the picture proposed by strohmayer et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "we then use our results to address two observational issues : ( i ) why oscillations are not seen in all bursts , and ( ii ) the observed long term stability of the oscillation frequency .",
    "the atmospheric evolution during the burst is shown schematically in figure [ fig : scheme ] for ( a ) mixed h / he ignition and ( b ) pure he ignition . as revealed by one - dimensional simulations ,",
    "the rapid energy release from helium burning reactions makes the initial stages of most bursts convective . later in the burst",
    ", the convection zone retreats , leaving a purely radiative atmosphere .",
    "figure [ fig : summ ] shows the thickness of the atmosphere which contains 90% of the mass , @xmath138%@xmath139 , as a function of the flux for constant flux radiative atmospheres ( solid and dotted lines ) and for the convective models of table [ tab : conv ] ( solid and open squares ) . for the radiative models ,",
    "the upper curve is for a composition profile the same as at ignition , while the lower curve is for a composition of @xmath304kr ( @xmath307ni ) for the mixed h / he ( pure he ) case , chosen to represent the products of burning .",
    "initially , the evolution of the thickness of the layer is along or above the upper curve as it ignites and heats up , depending on the extent of the convection zone . as nuclear burning proceeds , the mean molecular weight increases , and the thickness decreases , eventually moving back along the lower curve as the atmosphere cools . just before ignition ( upper curve , @xmath486 )",
    ", the thickness of the accumulated layer is @xmath217 . during the burst",
    ", the atmosphere expands hydrostatically by @xmath487@xmath488 ( @xmath234@xmath489 ) for mixed h / he ( pure he ) ignition . for a given flux ,",
    "the convective models have a greater thickness than fully - radiative models because the temperature profile is steeper in the convection zone , giving a larger base temperature ( compare tables [ tab : conv ] and [ tab : noconv ] ) .",
    "as we showed in  [ sec : burstmodels ] , radiation pressure plays an important role when @xmath490 , acting to lower the density and increase the hydrostatic expansion .",
    "we showed in  [ sec : expansion ] that in a radiative atmosphere , the magnitude of the spin down depends on depth .",
    "thus to observe a single , coherent frequency requires either the atmosphere to be rigidly rotating , or the burning region to be vertically thin ( miller 2000 ) , so the differential rotation across it is small .",
    "convection may enforce rigid rotation ; however , one - dimensional calculations of bursts show that convection persists only for the first @xmath491 of the burst when the energy production is dominated by temperature sensitive and rapid helium burning reactions . in  4 , we found that short wavelength baroclinic instabilities may act to enforce rigid rotation within the burning layers .",
    "theoretical studies of detailed burst models and further investigations of angular momentum transport mechanisms are needed to determine whether a coherent pulse is possible once convection has ceased .    to compare the predicted spin down with observed values , we assume that some mechanism operates to enforce rigid rotation within the burning layers , but that the burning layers remain decoupled from the underlying ashes , as suggested by the results of  4 . figure [ fig : summ2 ] shows the spin evolution of the atmosphere assuming that the whole atmosphere rigidly rotates . for both convective and fully - radiative models ,",
    "we ignore any differential rotation , and assume @xmath492 is constant , where @xmath493 is the moment of inertia of the atmosphere ( eq . [ [ eq : i ] ] ) .",
    "as in figure [ fig : summ ] , the evolution during the burst is shown by the arrows , first the atmosphere spins down as flux increases , then spins back up as burning proceeds , increasing the mean molecular weight , and as the atmosphere cools . to compare with observations",
    ", we also indicate the observed frequency shifts ( table [ tab : obs ] ) . for those bursts in which the oscillation frequency was seen only in the tail ( table [ tab : obs ] ) ,",
    "we plot @xmath272 as a lower limit , since some cooling will have occurred before the oscillation is first seen .",
    "figure [ fig : summ2 ] shows that the change in spin frequency for pure he ignition models is less than that for mixed h / he ignition , because of the smaller hydrostatic expansion . for the largest frequency shifts observed , @xmath494 ,",
    "pure he ignition models require a base temperature very close to the limiting value from radiation pressure ( eq . [ [ eq : tmax ] ] ) and @xmath495 , so that the density at the base is decreased , enhancing the expansion .",
    "it is much easier to get @xmath272 values this large with mixed h / he ignition , although as we describe below , all bursts with oscillations so far have the characteristics of pure he bursts .    in  [",
    "sec : expansion ] , we found that the time for heat to diffuse from the burning layers to the photosphere is @xmath496 .",
    "this delay explains why the spin down of the atmosphere is not observed at the beginning of a burst ; the expansion occurs before the signal is seen .",
    "we have also shown that the vertical propagation of heat through the atmosphere can affect the oscillation amplitude .",
    "a requirement for a large amplitude oscillation is that the time to transport heat from the burning layers ( or the top of the convection zone ) to the photosphere must be small compared to the shearing time across the atmosphere @xmath497 .",
    "if so , the shearing atmosphere transmits the burning pattern from below , much like passing a flashlight under a piece of paper . if not , the oscillation will be smeared out , the atmosphere being heated uniformly by the quickly revolving burning layers .",
    "our results show that there are important differences in spin evolution depending on whether the helium ignites in a pure helium or mixed h / he environment . because of the greater mean molecular weight of pure helium as opposed to a solar composition ,",
    "the expansion of the atmosphere in pure he bursts is roughly half that of mixed h / he bursts , giving a smaller @xmath272 ( figure [ fig : summ2 ] ) . also , the ratio of thermal time to shearing time is smaller for a pure helium atmosphere , and the energy production more localized because of the temperature sensitivity of he burning reactions , increasing the likelihood of observing coherent oscillations for pure he bursts .",
    "a puzzle is that oscillations are not seen in bursts from all sources , or in all bursts from a particular source .",
    "so far , there has been only one study of the relation between burst oscillations and properties of the bursts .",
    "muno et al .",
    "( 2000 ) studied nine x - ray bursts from ks 1731 - 26 which occurred during observations with @xmath498 at various times between 1996 july and 1999 february .",
    "they found that bursts which show coherent oscillations are of short duration ( @xmath344 ) , show radius expansion , and have high peak flux .",
    "these characteristics are typical of helium rich bursts",
    ". bursts with longer durations typical of h burning showed no oscillations .",
    "more studies are needed to see if this is a general result for other sources .",
    "certainly all reported burst oscillations that we can find appear to be in bursts of short duration typical of pure he ignition .",
    "as far as we are aware , oscillations have not been detected in bursts of long duration ( @xmath499 ) typical of h burning .",
    "why should only pure - he ignition bursts show oscillations ? the differences we find between pure he and mixed h / he bursts may provide an explanation . as we described in  3.4 ( see figure [ fig : therm ] ) , we find that the thermal time is less and the shearing time is greater for pure helium bursts , making it more likely that a large amplitude oscillation from deep regions may propagate outwards .",
    "the frequency evolution reported for six bursts is well fit by the model @xmath500 , where @xmath34 is the frequency in the burst tail , @xmath501 the amount by which the oscillation frequency changes and @xmath502 the decay time .",
    "the parameters of these fits are given in table 1 .",
    "the observed decay times @xmath503@xmath504 are similar to the expected cooling time of the burning layers ( eq . [ [ eq : ttherm ] ] ) .",
    "however , we found in  4 that there are mechanisms that might couple the burning layers to the star on a similar timescale .",
    "can we distinguish between these two possibilities observationally ?",
    "figure [ fig : summ ] shows that if the burning layers remain decoupled , the frequency observed in the burst tail will not be that of the neutron star spin .",
    "because of the greater mean molecular weight of the ashes , the thickness of the cooling atmosphere in the tail is different to the initial thickness by @xmath505 .",
    "this change in thickness depends on how complete the burning was , so that variations in the energetics and burning in the burst would translate into a scatter of @xmath4 part in @xmath37 in the final frequency .",
    "if the oscillation frequency could be shown to be more stable than this from one burst to the next , it would imply that the ashes and burning layers must recouple during the burst decay .",
    "this is complicated due to doppler shifts from the orbital motion of the neutron star , which change the observed frequency at a level @xmath506 ) across the orbit .",
    "strohmayer et al . ( 1998b ) showed that two bursts from 4u 1636 - 54 showed a frequency difference consistent with orbital doppler shifts , while two bursts from 4u 1728 - 34 separated by more than one year showed the same asymptotic frequency to @xmath4 part in @xmath37 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "if the orbital parameters are known and the orbital doppler shift accounted for , more measurements such as these would indicate whether recoupling occurs in the burst tail .",
    "we have shown that the hydrostatic expansion , spin down , and later spin up during contraction of the neutron star atmosphere naturally explains the magnitude and sign of the observed changes in the nearly coherent oscillations observed in type i x - ray bursts .",
    "our results support the simple picture proposed by strohmayer et al .",
    "( 1997a ) to explain the frequency evolution seen in type i bursts , and thus the identification of the burst oscillation frequency with the neutron star spin .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation is set not only by the lateral extent of the asymmetry on the neutron star surface , but also by the vertical propagation of heat through the shearing atmosphere .",
    "in addition , we find that the spin behavior differs depending on whether the burst results from pure he ignition or he ignition in a h - rich environment .",
    "the spin down is smaller by roughly a factor of two for pure he ignition as opposed to mixed h / he ignition , because the pure he models expand outwards less due to the larger mean molecular weight .",
    "in addition , the time for heat propagation through the atmosphere is smaller for pure he models",
    ".    this might explain why oscillations have not been detected during bursts of long duration ( @xmath507 ) typical of h burning ( for example , the bursts from gs 1826 - 24 shown in figures 2 and 5 of kong et al . 2000 ) .",
    "in particular , the recent study of muno et al .",
    "( 2000 ) of bursts from ks 1731 - 26 found oscillations only during those bursts with short durations @xmath344 , typical of pure he ignition .",
    "however , the largest values of @xmath272 that are observed ( for 4u  1702 - 43 and 4u  1728 - 34 ) require base temperatures very close to the limiting value from radiation pressure for pure he bursts , and this may prove to be a problem .",
    "more observational studies of the phenomenology of burst oscillations and their relation to burst properties and source properties , in particular accretion rate , are needed . with further theoretical work",
    ", these studies could give us important clues as to how the nature of nuclear burning during bursts depends on accretion rate , and help to resolve the disagreement with one - dimensional models first found with exosat ( bildsten 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "we have not found a robust hydrodynamical mechanism that recouples the burning layers to the underlying star in the @xmath344 burst duration .",
    "however , the coherence of the observed burst oscillations suggests that little differential rotation occurs within the burning layer itself . as we note in  [ sec : coupling ] , this might be accomplished through short vertical wavelength baroclinic instabilities , though more theoretical work is needed .",
    "we have not discussed the complex question of the lateral spreading of the burning front during the burst rise , or the cause of asymmetry in the cooling tail of bursts . in the simplest picture of a spreading burning front ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1997b ; strohmayer et al .",
    "1998c ) it is a mystery why oscillations are seen in the burst tail , when the whole surface has ignited .",
    "one possible explanation is that an asymmetry arises because the atmosphere takes a finite time to cool once ignited , and a finite time to spread around the star .",
    "thus the matter on the opposite side of the star from the ignition point will be a little hotter since it ignited later .",
    "if the flux at each point is @xmath508 once ignited , and the burning front propagates around the whole star ( starting at the equator ) in a time @xmath509 , it is straightforward to show that the peak - to - peak luminosity amplitude in the tail for an observer looking down on the ignition point is @xmath510 , or , for @xmath511 , @xmath512 .",
    "thus for a spreading time @xmath513 and @xmath514 , the peak - to - peak amplitude in the tail is a few percent , a little less than the 520% amplitudes observed ( smith , morgan & bradt 1997 ; zhang et al .",
    "1998 ; strohmayer et al .",
    "another possibility is that the oscillations come and go because of changes in the vertical transport of heat rather than changes in the size of the asymmetry on the stellar surface . for example , figure [ fig : therm ] shows that as the atmosphere heats up during the burst rise , the ratio of thermal time to wrap - around time @xmath515 increases .",
    "as this ratio increases , it becomes more likely that the oscillation will be washed out .",
    "it may be that at the burst peak , the oscillations disappear because of this effect .",
    "we have not addressed what mechanism might cause frequency doubling during bursts , as seems to be the case for at least one source ( 4u 1636 - 56 ; miller 1999 ) .",
    "there are two processes that we have discussed in this paper that may play a role .",
    "the first is the recoupling mechanism .",
    "if the burning layers recouple to the neutron star during the burst , they may do so in an @xmath40 pattern , leading to frequency doubling .",
    "our linear instability analysis of the two - layer beta - plane model (  [ sec : baroclinic ] ) suggests that the baroclinic instability would have @xmath516 when it goes unstable .",
    "however , we have not calculated the correct spherical eigenfunctions .",
    "the second possible process is the azimuthal wrapping of the the magnetic field .",
    "if an initially dipolar field is wound up , an @xmath40 pattern might emerge in the flow .    a test for the rotational modulation hypothesis might be the distribution of observed @xmath272 values . for sources undergoing x - ray bursts of the same type ( for example , similar accretion rates and same type of ignition ) on similar mass neutron stars , we would expect the distribution of @xmath272 values to be the same for each source , and independent of the spin frequency or number of hotspots on the surface .",
    "in fact , the distribution of @xmath272 so far ( table 1 ) looks bimodal , though we should be wary of small number statistics .",
    "two sources , 4u 1728 and 4u 1702 , which have @xmath517 show frequency changes @xmath518@xmath519 , whereas the other four objects which have @xmath38 show frequency changes about half as large , @xmath520@xmath521 .",
    "if further observations show this bimodal distribution to be true , this might indicate that the expansion of the atmosphere is less for the @xmath38 objects , for example , because of pure he rather then mixed h / he ignition .",
    "alternatively , we note that the @xmath501 values are very similar for all six objects , and this might point to another explanation for the observed frequency evolution .",
    "care must be taken that the observed @xmath272 represents the change in burst oscillation frequency from the burst rise to the burst tail .",
    "for example , if the oscillation is seen only during the burst tail , the observed @xmath272 does not represent the full spin down of the atmosphere , as in this case some cooling will have occurred before the oscillation is seen .",
    "we have not discussed other explanations for the frequency drifts .",
    "one possibility is that the burst oscillation is a non - radial oscillation ( nro ) on the neutron star surface ( livio & bath 1982 ; mcdermott & taam 1987 ; bildsten & cutler 1995 ; strohmayer & lee 1996 ) .",
    "non - radial oscillations of the frequency observed would be plausible on a rapidly rotating star , as the coriolis force takes the typically much lower - frequency modes and makes them mugh higher ( bildsten , ushomirsky and cutler 1996 )",
    ". the observed frequency would be close to the spin frequency of the star or some multiple @xmath522 , and might change by a @xmath523@xmath524 during the burst as the atmosphere cooled .",
    "however , it is not clear why only a single mode would be selected , and why that frequency would be stable on timescales of a year or more , for which conditions in the surface layers of the star would most likely change significantly .",
    "the physics of expansion - induced shear during shell flashes may prove important in other contexts .",
    "for example , mixing due to shear instabilities during a classical nova explosion could provide the enrichment of cno elements necessary to achieve a fast nova ( see truran 1982 for a review of the enrichment problem ) .",
    "previous authors have investigated shear mixing during accumulation of the fuel ( see livio & truran 1990 for a review ) , but not during the burst itself when shear is induced by expansion of the atmosphere as in a type i x - ray burst .",
    "a similar situation arises in agb stars during he shell flashes , where mixing of carbon into the proton rich envelope is necessary to allow production of s - process elements ( iben 1991 ; sackmann & boothroyd 1991 ; langer et al .",
    "1999 ) , and perhaps could be achieved by shear instabilities during shell flashes .",
