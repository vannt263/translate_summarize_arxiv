    "one of the most important intuitions into the nature of gravity would have to be mach s principle .",
    "mach argued that the inertial properties and the gravitational properties of an object are determined by the general mass distribution of the entire universe .",
    "mach s speculation leads to the idea that the gravitation constant @xmath0 may change with time due to the time dependence of the density and the size of the universe .",
    "dirac suggested another alternative , that @xmath0 can vary with time in his large number hypothesis : @xmath1 . in his hypothesis , he noticed that there are coincidences among very large dimensionless numbers . in dirac",
    "s cosmology , the reason for these large values is simply the fact that the universe is old @xcite .    a more theoretically reliable and one of the most studied modified theories of gravity may be the brans - dicke theory @xcite .",
    "brans and dicke introduced a scalar field @xmath2 that is related to gravity by @xmath3 and suggested the following lagrangian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ricci scalar , @xmath2 is the brans - dicke field , and @xmath6 is the brans - dicke coupling constant .",
    "although the brans - dicke theory was inspired by mach s principle , in fact , the theory has deep fundamental bases in fields from string theory to cosmology .",
    "for example , the brans - dicke theory with @xmath7 limit can be obtained in a weak coupling limit of dilaton gravity , in which the dilaton field is a direct consequence of string theory @xcite .",
    "also , the brans - dicke theory can be obtained in a weak field limit of the randall - sundrum model @xcite , where @xmath6 is sufficiently large on the positive tension brane and @xmath8 on the negative tension brane @xcite . moreover",
    ", the brans - dicke field can violate the null energy condition .",
    "thus , it is useful in studying the exotic matter that allows wormhole geometry @xcite . in cosmology",
    ", there has been some discussion to the effect that the brans - dicke field can be a candidate for dark matter or dark energy @xcite .    in this paper , we study the dynamics of false vacuum bubbles in the brans - dicke theory using the thin shell or thin wall approximation @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of bubbles in the brans - dicke theory using the thin shell approximation have already been discussed by some authors @xcite . however , the previous authors considered cases in which the brans - dicke field becomes continuous around the shell .",
    "it is obviously true that the field value should be continuous ; however , if the field varies on the shell and the shell is sufficiently thin , field values of the inside and the outside of the shell do not necessarily have to be the same @xcite . in this paper , we allow discontinuous field values between the inside and the outside of the shell , while maintaining the condition of the thin shell approximation .    in brans - dicke theory , the strength of gravity can be tuned by the brans - dicke field @xmath2 .",
    "we will tune the gravity of the inside of the shell , while that of the outside will be einstein gravity .",
    "one possible expectation is that the difference of the brans - dicke field can violate the null energy condition @xcite .",
    "a similar situation was studied by previous authors using a non - minimally coupled scalar field . in @xcite",
    ", the authors obtained an expanding false vacuum bubble without the initial singularity after a nucleation @xcite . in those works , the effective gravitation constant",
    "is still maintained as positive , even if the effective tension is negative . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of non - minimal coupling is interpreted as an additional positive tension on the shell of a true vacuum bubble .",
    "the additional tension due to the non - minimal coupling is changed dynamically in the case of massive true vacuum bubbles . in this case",
    ", there exists a bound type solution , which contracts and eventually collapses to a black hole @xcite .",
    "the breathing false vacuum bubble has also been studied and the possible origins of the energy contents of thin shells has been discussed @xcite .    in the original brans - dicke theory , the brans - dicke field does not have a potential term .",
    "thus , it is difficult to obtain a stable de sitter space @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a potential of the brans - dicke field .",
    "this potential makes it possible to find a field configuration in which the inside of the shell is a stable de sitter space while the outside is a stable schwarzschild space . by tuning the brans - dicke field",
    ", we can make the gravitation of the inside of the bubble relatively weaker or stronger than that of the outside .",
    "this can give a negative tension to the shell .",
    "then , the negative tension allows new solutions that were disallowed in einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "the new solutions include an expanding solution for the outside observer .",
    "since the null energy condition is violated , the initial state of the bubble does not necessarily have to be unbuildable @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : eofm ] , we derive the junction conditions in the brans - dicke theory of gravity by following the method used in @xcite ; in section  [ sec : dyn ] , the dynamics of false vacuum bubbles are studied and their causal structures are classified ; and in section  [ sec : dis ] , we discuss the physical meaning of new solutions and their physical implications .",
    "to describe a space - time with two qualitatively different domains and the transition region is relatively thinner than domains , one may describe such system by two distinct strategies .",
    "the intuitive approach is this : first calculate a continuous field combination between two domains , and second approximate the transition region as a physical object , e.g. , a thin shell .",
    "however , the technically simple approach is this : consider two discontinuous domains and input a domain wall as an independent object .",
    "the first approach is physically correct , but it is equivalent with the second approach when the transition region is sufficiently thinner than each domains so that the transition region behaves as a physical object . in this limit , we can consider domain walls or thin shells by a nambu - goto type action and this method was already applied by previous authors @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a space - time that is separated by a thin shell into two distinct four - dimensional regions , @xmath9 ( outside ) and @xmath10 ( inside ) , with boundaries , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . to obtain a single glued space - time @xmath13",
    ", we demand that the boundaries be identified as follows : @xmath14 .",
    "this system can be obtained after the nucleation of a false vacuum bubble in the brans - dicke theory of gravity . actually , the brans - dicke field and the scalar field are continuous from inside to outside through the wall or shell . in the shell , the fields vary continuously between the true and false vacuum states @xcite . after the nucleation of a vacuum bubble we may employ the thin shell approximation @xcite . in the approximation ,",
    "the shell can be considered as a singular surface in the sense that a non - vanishing surface energy density exists . in this paper",

    "if these bubbles are able to be prepared by physical processes , it can cause a violation of unitarity or a loss of information .",
    "one question is whether the initial states can be prepared or not . if we assume einstein gravity , global hyperbolicity , and the null energy condition , an initial state of an inflating space can not be geodesically complete along the past direction @xcite .",
    "hence , the initial condition requires more than general relativity @xcite .",
    "however , for our new solutions , the previous argument can not have this implication , since the bubbles violate the null energy condition .",
    "therefore , there is no reason to believe that the bubbles are unbuildable .",
    "thus , if one accepts that our new expanding bubble solutions are allowed so that the solutions can violate unitarity and cause an information loss problem , it will have important implications @xcite .",
    "for example , even if the background is an anti de sitter space or a de sitter space , as long as the background cosmological constant is sufficiently small , our results will be maintained .",
    "then , one may infer that the brans - dicke theory in an anti de sitter or a de sitter space may violate unitarity .",
    "what is the implication of this situation to the ads / cft or ds / cft correspondence @xcite",
    "? what is the implication to the information loss problem of black holes @xcite ?",
    "these problems remain for future work .",
