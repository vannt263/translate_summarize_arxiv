    "following the introduction of near - ir selected galaxy surveys nearly a decade ago , it became clear that a substantial population of massive , apparently evolved , galaxies was already in place by @xmath11 ( e.g. cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "2004 ) , a result which was completely unexpected within the context of contemporary models of galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "moreover , in line with our current understanding of galaxy `` downsizing '' , it was quickly realised that the high - mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function was assembled much earlier than had been expected , with studies of near - ir selected samples confirming that @xmath12 of the local number density of @xmath13 galaxies was already in place by @xmath14 ( e.g. caputi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "although the latest generation of galaxy evolution models are now more successful at reproducing the observed number densities of high - mass galaxies as a function of redshift ( e.g. cirasuolo et al . 2010 ) , it has been known for several years that the physical properties of high - mass galaxies at @xmath15 are substantially different from their low - redshift counterparts .",
    "specifically , based on hst imaging of near - ir selected galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field , daddi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) noted that many high mass ( @xmath16 ) early - type galaxies ( etgs ) at @xmath17 displayed substantially smaller half - light radii than equivalently massive galaxies observed in the local universe . over the last few years , the size evolution of massive etgs has been extensively discussed in the literature and many studies ( e.g. trujillo et al .",
    "2007 ; cimatti et al . 2008 ; saracco et al . 2009 ; williams et al .",
    "2010 ) have reported that massive red / passive etgs at @xmath18 are a factor of @xmath19 smaller than etgs of the same mass in the sdss ( shen et al .",
    "2003 ) .    despite initial concerns that results regarding the compactness of high - redshift passive galaxies could be affected by surface - brightness dimming , morphological k - corrections or even unresolved agn components ( e.g. daddi et al . 2005 ) , deep , high - resolution ,",
    "near - ir imaging has conclusively demonstrated the compactness of many massive ( @xmath16 ) galaxies at @xmath20 ( e.g. buitrago et al .",
    "2008 ; damjanov et al .",
    "in addition , it is now well established that , within a given redshift and stellar mass interval , early - type / passive galaxies are more compact than late - type / star - forming galaxies ( e.g. zirm et al . 2007 ; toft et al .",
    "2009 ; williams et al . 2010 ; wuyts et al .",
    "2011 ) .    in reality , the full picture is undoubtedly more complicated still , with some studies ( e.g. mancini et al . 2010 ) identifying examples of massive @xmath15 etgs with half - light radii fully consistent with the local size - mass relation and others ( e.g. saracco et al .",
    "2009 ) finding that the population of high - redshift etgs is comprised of a mixture of normal and compact galaxies .",
    "moreover , it is still not currently clear whether the compact nature of some massive etgs at high redshift is related to the age of their stellar population ( saracco et al .",
    "2009 ) , or not ( trujillo , ferreras & de la rosa 2011 ) . finally , there have been concerns raised in the literature that comparing massive high - redshift etgs with the local galaxy population is subject to severe progenitor bias . for example , it has been claimed that the number densities of compact etgs at high redshift are actually compatible with compact cluster galaxies seen locally ( valentinuzzi et al .",
    "2010 ) , although this has been disputed by taylor et al .",
    "significantly , van dokkum et al . (",
    "2010 ) attempted to circumvent the progenitor bias problem by studying the size evolution of galaxies selected to have a constant number density of @xmath21mpc@xmath22 ( equivalent to @xmath23 at @xmath24 ) , finding strong evidence for size evolution of the form @xmath25 .",
    "it is thus clear that some physical process ( or processes ) must be in place at high redshift which is capable of substantially increasing the half - light radii of a significant subset of massive high - redshift galaxies , without requiring an unphysical increase in their stellar masses .",
    "a widely advocated solution to the problem has been the `` dry - merger '' scenario , whereby dense high - redshift galaxies are transformed via a series of dissipationless ( i.e. dry ) mergers ( e.g. cimatti , nipoti & cassata 2012 ) .",
    "such dry mergers are typically envisioned to be major - mergers ( i.e. mass ratio @xmath26 1:3 ) in which the galaxy half - light radius increases in direct proportion to the accreted stellar mass .",
    "although this scenario has several desirable characteristics , it also suffers from several obvious problems ( see nipoti et al . 2009 ; 2012 ) .",
    "principal among these is the prediction from n - body simulations that massive @xmath16 galaxies at @xmath27 are only likely to undergo one major merger over the proceeding @xmath28 gyr ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "2010 ) , strongly suggesting that major mergers _ alone _ can not explain the size evolution of massive high - redshift galaxies .",
    "an alternative mechanism invokes size growth via a sequence of minor mergers , with typical mass ratios of 1:10 .",
    "the advantage of this mechanism is that in a minor merger , radius growth is expected to be proportional to the square of the accreted mass ( e.g. naab et al . 2009 ; bluck et al .",
    "2012 ) , allowing rapid size growth without excessive growth in stellar mass .",
    "the minor - merger scenario has recently gained support from hydro - dynamical simulations ( e.g. johansson , naab & ostriker 2012 ; oser et al . 2012 ) and the observational results from van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2010 ) which demonstrate that , at a constant number density of @xmath29mpc@xmath22 , the size evolution of galaxies is consistent with an `` inside - out '' growth scenario .",
    "finally , it has also been suggested ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2008 ) that feedback from active galactic nuclei could expel material from the central regions of high - redshift galaxies , thereby allowing them to expand significantly at a constant stellar mass .",
    "however , the increase in stellar - velocity dispersion with redshift predicted by this model may be in conflict with the latest available data ( e.g. trujillo et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "in this paper we analyse the sizes , stellar masses , morphologies and specific star - formation rates of a unique sample of massive galaxies from the ukidss ultra - deep survey ( uds ) with spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath0 .",
    "based on this sample we investigate the evolution in the galaxy size - mass relation over a look - back time of 9 gyr , using accurate stellar - mass measurements derived from full spectro - photometric fitting of the available spectra and multi - wavelength photometry .",
    "armed with accurate stellar - mass measurements and star - formation rates based on a range of empirical indicators , we investigate whether any off - set from the local size - mass scaling relations is primarily driven by morphology , stellar population age or specific star - formation rate .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the relevant spectroscopic and photometric data , before describing the methods adopted to estimate the stellar masses and galaxy radii in section 3 . in section 4 we present our main results on the stellar mass - size relation and investigate the dynamical mass - size relation for a small sub - sample of objects with reliable stellar - velocity dispersion measurements . in section 5 we outline a plausible evolutionary scenario which is capable of reconciling the size - mass relation of passive galaxies at @xmath2 with that observed locally . in section 6 we present our final conclusions . throughout this work",
    "a cosmology of @xmath30 km s@xmath4mpc@xmath4 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is assumed and all magnitudes are quoted in the ab system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "all of the galaxies studied in this work have been selected from the ukirt ultra deep survey ( uds ) .",
    "the uds is the deepest of five surveys being undertaken with the uk infra - red telescope in hawaii , which together comprise the uk infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; @xcite ) .",
    "the uds covers an area of @xmath33 sq .",
    "degrees , is centred on ra=02:17:48 , dec=@xmath3405:05:57 and is currently the deepest , large area , near - ir survey in existence .",
    "in addition to the available ukirt near - ir imaging , the uds is supported by a wide array of multi - wavelength datasets , ranging from the x - ray to radio rgimes ( e.g. cirasuolo et al .",
    "2010 ) . in this section",
    "we briefly summarize the properties of the uds datasets which have been directly exploited during the course of this study .",
    "the latest release of the uds , data release eight ( dr8 ) , consists of @xmath35 imaging to @xmath36depths of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( 2 arcsec - diameter apertures ) .",
    "moreover , in this study we have also made use of @xmath40band imaging of the uds ( y=23.6 ; @xmath41 ) obtained during the verification phase of the vista video survey ( jarvis et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "in addition to the available near - ir imaging , the second key imaging dataset in the uds is the deep subaru optical imaging obtained as part of the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ) .",

    "degrees to @xmath41 depths of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( 2 arcsec - diameter apertures ) .",
    "the final key dataset used in this work is the spitzer public legacy survey of the ukidss ultra deep survey ( spuds ) .",
    "the spuds imaging covers the full near - ir survey area and consists of irac imaging to @xmath41 depths of @xmath48m=23.7 , @xmath49m=23.3 , @xmath50m=21.6 , @xmath51m=21.4 ( 3.8 arcsec - diameter apertures ) and mips imaging to a @xmath41 depth of @xmath52m=18.9 ( 15 arcsec - diameter apertures ) .",
    "the optical spectra analysed here were observed on the vlt as part of the systematic spectroscopic follow - up of the uds obtained through the eso large programme eso 180.a-0776 ( udsz ; p.i .",

    "although full details of udsz will be presented in almaini et al .",
    "( 2012 , in preparation ) , below we provide a brief description of the key elements within the context of this study .",
    "the udsz programme was allocated a total of 235 hours of observations , with 93 hours allocated for observations with the vimos spectrograph ( 8 pointings ) and 142 hours allocated for fors2 observations ( 20 pointings ) .",
    "the primary science driver for udsz was to obtain spectroscopic observations of a representative sample of @xmath53band selected galaxies ( @xmath54 ) , photometrically pre - selected to lie at redshift @xmath55 .",
    "consequently , the selection of primary targets was designed to obtain spectra for a random 1-in-6 sampling of @xmath54 galaxies with @xmath56 ( with a control sample of @xmath57 galaxies with @xmath58 ) .    in order to exploit the different strengths of the two spectrographs , bluer galaxies ( @xmath59 ) were targeted with vimos and redder galaxies ( @xmath60 ) were targeted with fors2 .",
    "all of the galaxies analysed in this paper were part of the spectroscopic sample observed with fors2 and each target received 5 hours of on - source integration with the medium - resolution grs@xmath61300i grism ( @xmath62@xmath63 with @xmath64 ) . in total 718 ( @xmath54 ) galaxies",
    "were targeted with fors2 , returning 451 science - grade redshifts .",

    "the sample analysed in this study consists of all eighty - one udsz galaxies with robust fors2 spectroscopic redshifts ( i.e. based on multiple spectral features ) in the range @xmath75 which are brighter than @xmath70 ( hereafter the k - bright sample ) .",
    "this magnitude limit is bright enough to fully exploit the large - area coverage of the uds and to ensure that each member of the sample has an unambiguous spectroscopic redshift , while still being deep enough to produce a final sample which is mass - complete to a limit of @xmath76 , even for the most passive galaxies ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the upper redshift limit of @xmath77 was chosen to guarantee coverage of the 4000 break at the red end of the fors2 spectra and the lower redshift limit of @xmath78 was adopted to ensure that the fors2 spectra also cover the age - sensitive spectral breaks at 2600 and 2800 .",
    "if the results derived from this study are to be applied to the general massive galaxy population at @xmath2 , it is clearly necessary to demonstrate that the k - bright sample is not a highly biased sub - set of the general galaxy population at this epoch . in order to investigate this issue , in the upper panel of fig .",
    "1 we plot the distribution of @xmath65 colours for the k - bright sample , compared to that of all n=1178 galaxies in the uds photometric redshift catalogue of cirasuolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) which satisfy the criteria : @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "although similar , a two - sample ks test demonstrates that the two distributions are actually statistically distinguishable at the @xmath81 level .",
    "as can clearly be seen from fig .",
    "1 , unusually for a spectroscopic sample , the difference is caused by the fact that the k - bright sample does not feature a large enough tail of blue ( @xmath82 ) objects .",
    "this feature of the fors2 spectroscopic sample is by design and is the result of deliberately targeting the bluer members of the udsz sample with the vimos spectrograph .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 we show the @xmath65 distribution of the k - bright sample compared to the n=970 objects from the cirasuolo et al .",
    "photometric redshift catalogue which satisfy : @xmath83 , @xmath80 _ and _ @xmath84 . with this additional colour criterion",
    "the two distributions are now statistically _ indistinguishable _ ( @xmath73 )",
    ". for galaxies at @xmath2 with @xmath66 , insisting on a colour of @xmath84 is effectively the same as insisting that stellar mass is @xmath74 ( see section 4 ) .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the k - bright sample is a statistically random sub - sample of the galaxy population at @xmath85 with stellar masses @xmath74 . for information , in table a1 of the appendix we provide the basic observational data and derived properties for the eighty - one members of the k - bright galaxy sample .",
    "the udsz spectroscopic programme was designed to provide a random , 1-in-6 ( @xmath86 ) , sampling of the @xmath15 galaxy population with @xmath87 . however , at the @xmath80 magnitude limit of the k - bright sample the fors2 component of the udsz spectroscopy programme actually provides a significantly higher sampling rate of the very high - mass end of the galaxy mass function at @xmath0 .",
    "based on the cirasuolo et al .",
    "photometric redshift catalogue , and accounting for the differences in relative areal coverage , we calculate that , compared to the underlying galaxy population with @xmath88 , @xmath80 and @xmath89 , the sample factor of the k - bright sample is @xmath90 .",
    "it is this sampling factor which is adopted when comparing the k - bright sample to the local galaxy stellar mass function in section 5 .",
    "in addition to a precise spectroscopic redshift , for each member of the k - bright sample there is a deep , flux calibrated , red - optical fors2 spectrum and excellent multi - wavelength photometry spanning the range @xmath91 m @xmath92 m .",
    "consequently , in order to take full advantage of the available information , we have derived stellar mass and age measurements for each member of the k - bright sample via simultaneous spectro - photometric fitting of the fors2 spectrum and multi - wavelength photometry .          for the purposes of the spectro - photometric",
    "fitting we adopt both the @xcite ( hereafter bc03 ) and the charlot & bruzual ( 2007 ) ( hereafter cb07 ) stellar population synthesis models .",
    "the cb07 models were chosen because they include an updated treatment of thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars which could , at least potentially , have a large influence at rest - frame near - ir wavelengths for stellar populations with ages of @xmath93 gyr ( e.g. maraston 2005 ) . however , given that the influence of tp - agb stars remains controversial ( e.g. kriek et al .",
    "2010 ) , it was decided to investigate the range of stellar masses and ages returned by both the bc03 and cb07 stellar population synthesis models .    moreover , as galaxies are complex systems , potentially consisting of several stellar sub - systems from different generations of star - formation , in some cases it is necessary to invoke models with a variety of star - formation histories in order to obtain good fits to the data . to account for this",
    ", the data for each member of the k - bright sample was fitted using an extensive set of models encompassing a range of different star - formation histories , metallicities and dust attenuations .",
    "the data for each member of the k - bright sample was initially fitted using bc03 and cb07 models with exponentially decaying star - formation rates ( sfr ) ; so - called `` @xmath94models '' .",
    "the @xmath94models are parameterized such that sfr @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the time since star formation began and @xmath97 is the @xmath98folding time .",
    "a wide range of @xmath98folding times were considered , with the extreme values of @xmath99 gyr and @xmath100 gyr approximating constant star - formation and instantaneous burst models respectively . as listed in table 1 , in addition to @xmath98folding time ,",
    "a wide range of ages , metallicities and dust attenuations were also explored .",
    "all models employed in the spectro - photometric fitting were based on a @xcite imf and assumed the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) dust attenuation curve .",
    "although the @xmath94models effectively describe a range of different star - formation histories , they do not adequately describe the situation whereby the majority of a galaxy s stellar mass is produced rapidly at high redshift ( and dominates rest - frame near - ir wavelengths ) but a low - level of more recent star - formation dominates the observed flux at rest - frame uv / optical wavelengths . in order to account for this possibility",
    ", the data for each member of the k - bright sample was fitted using so - called `` double burst models '' ( hereafter db models ) .",
    "the db models consist of two sequential instantaneous bursts ( simple stellar populations ) , with one component required to be `` old '' ( age @xmath101 gyrs ) and one component required to be `` young '' ( age @xmath102 gyrs ) .",
    "the db models were constructed by normalising the flux of the younger stellar population to match that of the older population at a rest - frame wavelength of 5000 . in this way ,",
    "when the components were combined , the two populations naturally accounted for different fractions of the total galaxy mass .",
    "the mass fraction of the young component was allowed to vary between 0 and 1 , with a fine grid of values adopted at low - mass fractions due to the substantial impact on the rest - frame uv / optical from even small amounts of recent star - formation .",
    "finally , dust reddening was applied to the combined young+old stellar population using the calzetti ( 2000 ) dust attenuation law .",
    "in addition to providing improved flexibility , the db models offer the advantage of providing an estimate of the likely maximal stellar mass and age for each member of the k - bright sample ."
