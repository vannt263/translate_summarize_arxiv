    "there are two primary modes in surveying of large areas of the sky : 1 )  we need to cover _ sequentially _ the area in the reasonable time ; 2 )  the sky area we are interested in should be under _ continuous _ watching , as is the case when we look for the fast transient objects .",
    "to some extent , problems of the first kind can be solved with the help of wide - field telescopes with a flat field of view , such as those discussed by wilson ( 1996 ) and terebizh ( 2011 ) .",
    "it is easily seen that problems of the second kind require too many flat - field telescopes , so it seems that the better way in this case is the creation of a single telescope with an extremely wide angular field , even at a spherical focal surface .",
    "mm and a @xmath1 field.,width=302 ]    just this way was chosen in the second half of the last century , when the baker - nunn ( henize 1957 ; baker 1962 ) , hawkins and linfoot ( 1945 ) , and maksutov - sosnina ( 1950s , unpublished ) cameras were put into operation .",
    "their angular field attained @xmath5 , whereas the shielding of light and curvature of the focal surface were taken into account by application of narrow emulsion tape .",
    "the main disadvantages of these cameras were as follows : 1 )  some lens surfaces were substantially aspheric ; 2 )  the demanding sorts of glass were used in the correctors ; 3 )  nevertheless , the image quality was inadequate .",
    "for example , four surfaces of the baker - nunn camera were aspheres of 4th and 8th orders , the schott kzfs2 and sk14 glasses were applied , but the rated image of a point - like source of light was nearly @xmath6 m ( @xmath7 ) in diameter ( carter et al .",
    "later modification of the baker - nunn camera with aspheric surfaces of the same order but larger aperture provides 1 arc minite resolution in a narrow spectral band ( sasaki et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "m. the field angles are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( equal areas ) .",
    "airy disc diameter is @xmath14 m , box width is @xmath15 m @xmath16.,width=302 ]    in view of the above , it was somewhat surprisingly that an _ all - spherical system made of simplest types of glass _ yet provides nearly diffraction - limited polychromatic images in the field of the order of @xmath1 in diameter ( terebizh 2015 ) .",
    "a few further examples of such a system are given below .",
    "an example shown in fig .  1 has been designed for the aperture @xmath17  mm , effective focal length @xmath0  mm ( @xmath18 ) , waveband @xmath19 m and the @xmath1 field of view .",
    "all lenses can be made of the same material ; we prefer the fused silica because of its stability and excellent optical properties , in particular , high uv - transparency .    as one can see from fig .  2 ,",
    "the image quality is nearly constant across the field .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath20   diameter of a circle , that includes 80% of energy in the polychromatic image of a star , varies from @xmath21 m ( @xmath22 ) on the optical axis to @xmath23 m ( @xmath24 ) on the edge of the field .",
    "the complete description of the system is given in table  1 .",
    "the proposed system proceeds from the two generic versions of the bernhard schmidt ( 1931 ) camera , that were then developed by a.  bouwers ( 1941 , 1946 ) , d.d .",

    "the two inner lenses were inserted both to minimize coma and spherochromatic aberration .",

    "when working with wide - field telescopes , most important characteristics are the survey speed @xmath40(degree@xmath41/second ) and limiting magnitude @xmath42 given the exposure time @xmath26 .",

    "( deg@xmath41/sec , upper curve ) and limiting magnitude @xmath42 as the functions of the exposure time ( sec ) for the vt-119 g design.,width=302 ]    evidently , the large field of view entails high survey speed of the system .",
    "it is enough to say that at the exposure time @xmath54  sec the survey speed of @xmath55deg@xmath41/sec is attained , so the objects brighter than @xmath56 can be registered in the sky area of @xmath57  deg@xmath41 in @xmath58 minutes .    as regards limiting magnitude , it is difficult to expect its high value for a telescope of relatively small size .",
    "we see that for short exposures , which are specific to fast transients , the objects not fainter than about @xmath59 are attainable .",
    "the limit is increased to @xmath60 at the exposure time of @xmath61  sec . to reach more faint sources ,",
    "the proposed optical system can be scaled up , the more that the image quality is very weakly dependent on the size of the system ( see the next section ) .",
    "it seems quite evident that the significant survey efficiency , including both the deep limit and high speed , can be achieved by creating a hierarchical system , consisting of different types of telescopes .",
    "let us also estimate the _ sky survey rate _ @xmath62 , that was defined in the review of terebizh ( 2011 ) by equation ( a2 ) .",
    "it is simply the product of the observed sky area @xmath63 ( degree@xmath41 ) and",

    "as was mentioned , detectors may be positioned arbitrarily in the field of view . in this connection tonry ( 2015 )",

    "scaling both up and down leads to attractive systems ; we confine ourselves to the first option .",
    "model vt-119f ( table  3 ) with the aperture @xmath0  mm in diameter is a slightly optimized doubling of the design vt-119 g at the same angular field size .",
    "as before , all lenses are spherical and made of fused silica .",
    "it turned out that the image quality of both systems , the original and scaled one , is substantially the same in the angular measure , @xmath73 .",
    "this means , in particular , that for the equal exposure times system vt-119f provides about one magnitude fainter objects , than vt-119 g .",
    "( the doubling of diameter gives only @xmath74 , but we get an additional gain due to increased focal length . )",
    "since the system under consideration can be essentially scaled up at maintaining angular resolution over the whole field , one can get a theoretical design of even larger aperture .",
    "unfortunately , not optics by itself , but practical limitations on a lens size put the limit on further scaling . in particular , the diameter of the last lens in the system vt-119f is about @xmath75  m , which is already not far from the size reached by the modern technology based on the use of glass . because of soft tolerances , some plastic materials may be promising for the lenses .",
    "for example , replacement of fused silica in the system vt-119f with acrylic reduces the weight of the lens corrector twice at the same image quality and transparency in a wide spectral range .",
    "perhaps , further research will produce the more stable lenses made of plastic materials , especially of a simple spherical shape .",
    "another way , which is worth studying now , is to use the proposed design as the core of some light - gathering system of larger size .",
    "the curvature of the focal surface is as natural for wide - field telescopes , as for the human eye .",
    "the key step at the transition from conventional telescopes to really wide - field systems is changing the type of symmetry of an optical system . as noted by g.h .",

    "just this feature allowed to expand radically the field of view .",
    "it can be shown that the proposed here all - spherical system provides the high quality images with the field size of more than @xmath76 .",

    "in particular , curved detector has been implemented in the darpa 3.5  m space surveillance telescope ( blake et al .",
    "2013 ) .    besides",
    ", one need to keep in mind the long - known technology based on a plurality of delicate waveguides with a curved in aggregate input faced to the focal surface .",
    "the method of working with the spherical focal surface applicable currently is the using of small flat detectors each of which is equipped with a flattening lens .",
    "this way has been implemented , e.g. , in the _ kepler _ space telescope that has the @xmath79  cm aperture and the equivalent field diameter of @xmath11 .",
    "its detector consists of 21 pairs of ordinary 59  mm @xmath78 28  mm ccds covered by sapphire field - flattening lenses . as to the vt-119 g design",
    ", the curvature radius of its focal surface is 782  mm , so with a small flat detector of size , say , 25  mm the edge images are blurred up to @xmath80 microns .",
    "our preliminary consideration shows that the image quality can be improved considerably even by a single lenslet made of fused silica , and is fully recovered by the doublet of the same material .",
    "the problem becomes much simpler for larger telescopes similar to vt-119f .",
