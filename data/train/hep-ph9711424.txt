    "it is well known that there is considerable discrepancy between the observed solar neutrino fluxes and their theoretical predictions based on the standard solar models .",
    "to solve the longstanding solar neutrino problem  @xcite , the most natural scenario is to include the effect of matter on neutrino oscillations ( the msw effect )  @xcite .",
    "the sm interaction between the neutrinos and the electrons in solar matter would enhance the @xmath1 conversion and that could account for the apparent deficit in the solar neutrino flux . if indeed the msw effect is the cause of the solar neutrino problem , a similar situation would exist for the neutrinos produced in supernova explosions , such as those detected from the 1987a supernova .",
    "the effect of the msw effect in the light of the sm on the supernova neutrino signal has been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a lot of discussions on possible new neutrino interactions beyond those of the sm .",
    "if these interactions do exist , they would have to be included in the study of neutrino propagation in matter .",
    "interest in this subject has heightened especially after the recent announcement of observing an excess of large-@xmath2 @xmath3 scattering events at hera  @xcite , with a possible signature for leptoquark formation .",
    "also , possible flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and flavor diagonal neutral currents ( fdnc ) arise naturally in a number of extensions of the sm , such as the left - right symmetric models  @xcite and supersymmetric models with r - parity violation  @xcite . in fact , they have been recently discussed in the study of solar neutrinos  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of these new physics interactions on the supernova neutrino signal",
    ". it will be another test of these new models which covers a wider range of neutrino parameters compared to the solar neutrino analysis .",
    "we neglect the non - standard fdnc interactions as the current limits on them make their effect negligible if neutrinos have mass . in section 2",
    ", we use the three - flavor formalism to derive the survival probability for neutrinos in the presence of fcnc beyond the sm .",
    "the three - flavor formalism is appropriate for describing supernova neutrinos because of the large range of densities in the supernova which the neutrinos must traverse .",
    "this means that , for all conceivable neutrino mass differences , both @xmath4 and @xmath5 conversions will go through the resonance regions  @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we show the results of our calculations for the suppression ( enhancement ) ratio of the neutrino events due to supernova bursts which can be observed by the superkamiokande  @xcite and the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno )  @xcite ( already in the construction phase ) .",
    "the latter detector has the advantage of being sensitive to all neutrino flavors , not just @xmath6 s .",
    "we use typical values for the initial fluxes of the different neutrino flavors produced during a supernova collapse based on theoretical models describing supernova collapse and which are in a good agreement with the 1987a event . in our @xmath7 contours",
    ", we emphasize the case where we have only @xmath8 scattering , however , other new physics interactions can be easily included in the analysis .",
    "the only relevant sm interaction which is effective in the msw effect is the standard @xmath9-exchange charged current @xmath10 .",
    "however , in supersymmetric theories without r - parity and other non - sm models , new types of possible neutrino interactions with matter enter the picture .",
    "we can divide these interactions into two types : flavor changing neutrino currents ( fcnc ) and flavor diagonal neutral currents ( fdnc ) . to be specific",
    ", we will present an analysis based on r - parity violating supersymmetric models . however , similar results as well as our parameterization of the effective interactions will follow had we chosen to use other theoretical models . in particular , we will be interested in the following lepton - number - violating contributions to the superpotential  @xcite : @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the usual lepton and quark su(2 ) doublets and singlets , respectively , and @xmath14 are generation indices . because of the contraction of the su(2 ) indices , the coefficients @xmath15 should be antisymmetric under the exchange of @xmath16 and @xmath17",

    "the order of the new physics corrections can be at most @xmath45 and this is due to the current bounds from rare decays , atomic parity violation , etc .",
    "the largest corrections would be due to transitions between the first and third generations  @xcite .",
    "the relevant parameters in terms of the @xmath46 squark mass , @xmath47 , are : @xmath48 @xmath49 they are currently bounded from above at the order of @xmath45 .    to find the effective mixing angles in matter , we diagonalize @xmath50 .",
    "we can rotate the flavor basis by the factor @xmath51 and find the eigenvalues of the transformed mass matrix @xmath52 where    = @xmath53 , @xmath54 , + @xmath55 , + @xmath56 , + @xmath57 , + @xmath58 .",
    "we are using the same notation of ref .",

    "note that our expressions for the mixing angles lead to the sm three - flavor solutions  @xcite when @xmath75 . if we assume a mass hierarchy , where @xmath76 , we can separate the two resonance regions , each resembling a two - flavor resonance and the three - flavor survival probability can be written as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are given by  @xcite : @xmath80 and @xmath81 the level - crossing probability , @xmath82 , is given by @xmath83;\\eqno(2.14)\\ ] ] @xmath84 being the adiabaticity parameter and @xmath85 is a function dependent on the density profile which reduces to unity for a linear density function .",
    "note that the adiabaticity parameter , @xmath84 , is modified from its msw form , it is given by  @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 , while @xmath88 and @xmath89 for the lower and higher resonances respectively .",
    "we used the two - flavor result as both @xmath78 and @xmath79 have the two - flavor form with just a redefinition of variables .",
    "the parameter @xmath90 is given by @xmath91",
    "we will now apply our results to neutrinos emitted in a supernova explosion .",
    "as neutrinos come out of the core of the supernova , they would traverse through a medium whose density decreases to zero from a maximum value of about @xmath92 gm/@xmath93 .",
    "this means that the resonance condition , @xmath94 , will be satisfied for all conceivable neutrino masses .",
    "thus , unlike the case of the solar neutrinos , supernova neutrinos will go through two resonance regions as they stream out from the core and , hence , the three neutrino formalism presented in the previous section is necessary to describe them .    during a type ii supernova burst , we have two types of neutrino emission processes , neutronization and thermal processes .",
    "the former is due to electron capture process , @xmath95 while the latter occurs during the implosion of the supernova inner layers leading to the thermal production of neutrinos of all flavors in equal amounts .",
    "we will assume a fermi - dirac distribution for both the neutronization and thermal fluxes , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , with the following initial temperatures and luminosities  @xcite @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 where the superscripts @xmath101 and @xmath102 stand for thermal and neutronization , while the subscripts @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 denote the electron flavor , muon or tau flavors , and any flavor , respectively .",
    "of course , there are uncertainties related to these values due to the rarity of supernova events and the complication of theoretical calculations and there are now more detailed numerical calculations on the time evolution of supernova .",
    "however , our approximate approach seems reasonable since there are very few neutrino events available at the present and the results shown are quite insensitive to the model dependent quantities for a supernova .",
    "in addition , we will need the density profile of the core and mantle after the core collapse , it is given approximately by  @xcite @xmath106 with @xmath35 varying weakly with @xmath107 over the range @xmath108 .",
    "we assume the ratio @xmath109 .    knowing the survival probability , @xmath110 , we can plot the ratio of the number of events in a detector with oscillations present to the number of events without oscillations . for a light - water cerenkov detector",
    "there are two kinds of neutrino events : inverse beta decay which is isotropic and the @xmath20 scattering which is extremely directional and occurs for all flavors .",
    "these two classes of events combined with the two supernova emission processes leads to three relevant ratios to calculate .",
    "we show our plots for directional events from neutronization , the relevant ratio is given by  @xcite @xmath111}\\over{\\int{de_\\nu f_e^{0n}\\int{\\epsilon d\\sigma(\\nu_e+e)}}}},\\eqno(3.3)\\ ] ] here @xmath112 represents an integral over electron energies ( from 0 to @xmath113 ) of the differential cross section times @xmath114 , the energy - dependent detector efficiency ; @xmath115 represents @xmath116 or @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath118 is the survival probability of electron neutrinos given by the three - flavor expression , eq .",
    "( 2.12 ) , which depends on four independent parameters @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath33 and @xmath121 ; so , in order to make a 2-@xmath122 plot , we will have to constrain two of the four parameters . in the case of a @xmath123 detector ,",
    "of which the sno detector is an example , we will have the following important reactions with the deuterium nucleus in addition to the usual @xmath124 scattering : @xmath125 and@xmath126 of course , the cross sections for these processes are very difficult to obtain analytically and we will use fit functions in our calculations to represent the cross sections , @xmath127 , given in  @xcite . the ratio of events with oscillations to those without will be equal to unity for the first type of event as it is equally sensitive to all flavors of neutrinos while the corresponding ratio for the second type is given by @xmath128\\sigma(\\nu_e+d)}\\over\\int{de_\\nu \\epsilon f_e^{0 t } \\sigma(\\nu_e+d)}},\\eqno(3.5)\\ ] ] where again @xmath114 is the efficiency of our detector .",
    "we assume in our calculations @xmath114 to be the same for the superkamiokande and sno detectors .",

    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) show the contour plots for the superkamiokande detector and the sno detector .",
    "plots for different values of @xmath130 , the ratio between the new physics coupling to the sm coupling , are shown .",
    "note that we get a similar behavior in the case of the study of solar neutrinos ( see ref .",
    "we use the following constraints : @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "we neglect the earth regeneration effects in our plots . in fig .",
    "( 2 ) , we have the expected sm behavior with the upper part of the contour corresponding to the adiabatic solution while the lower left side of the triangles correponding to the non - adiabatic solution .",
    "note the two resonance regions correponding to the conversions between different flavors .",
    "the isocontours for the two experiments are the same since we assumed the same efficiency for the two detectors which is only an approximation .",
    "( 3 ) shows the effect of including non - sm couplings . at @xmath133 ,",
    "the shape of the contours is significantly different from the sm case .",
    "we have a central region occuring at all values of the mixing angle where the event ratio is maximally different from 1.0 ( 0.2 in the case of sk and 2.3 in the case of sno ) .",
    "note that we have an enhancement in the number of observed events in the case of the sno detector . at @xmath134 ,",
    "we regain the adiabatic solution at large @xmath135 , also the central region divides into two regions . for negative couplings",
    ", we have an additional bump due to the divergence occuring at @xmath136 ( leading to @xmath137 ) .",
    "note that for large values of the mixing angle , the effect of the new physics coupling becomes negligible and the large angle solution in the far right part of the plots becomes the same as the sm solution .",
    "finally as we reach very small values of the couplings , @xmath138 , we start to regain the sm solution .",
    "we should note that the parameters ( @xmath139 ) are already bounded by other experiments : chooz  @xcite , superkamiokande studies of solar  @xcite and atmospheric  @xcite neutrinos , etc .",
    "the current bounds can be summarized as :    * small angle solution for solar neutrinos based on the msw effect : @xmath140 @xmath141 * large angle solution for solar neutrinos based on the msw effect : @xmath142 @xmath143 * vacuum oscillation solution for solar neutrinos : @xmath144 @xmath145 * solution for atmospheric neutrinos : @xmath146 @xmath147",
    "supernova explosions provide us with a very useful laboratory for testing the ideas of neutrino oscillations in matter as after their production in a supernova core , neutrinos travel through a wide range of densities not available anywhere else . in this paper , we include non - standard fcnc neutrino interactions into the treatment of neutrino propagation in a supernova .",
    "we may parametrize these effects as four - fermi effective interactions ( @xmath148 . depending on the process",
    ", stringent bounds already exist on @xmath114 , typically of the order of @xmath45 or less .",
    "however , it is found that the changes in the rates of neutrino signals are appreciable even for @xmath114 as small as @xmath149 .",
    "we showed numerical results in connection with the superkamiokande and the sno detectors .",
    "it should be noted that the dependence of @xmath114 is intertwined with that of the neutrino mixing angles .",
    "our results are therefore especially useful when combined with other measures which determine the bounds on mixing angles or when more definitive information on @xmath114 are available from direct measurements  @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "observing neutrino signals from supernovae would be another test for non - standard models which include fcnc interactions , such as the r - parity violating susy models .",
    "it may impose new constraints on the non - standard neutrino couplings or , more interestingly , signal new experimental evidence for these models .",
    "this treatment is complementary to other studies of fcnc interactions in supernova where the bounds on these interactions are inferred from their effect on electron antineutrino spectrum and r - processes  @xcite .",
