    "radical - ion pairs and their spin - dependent reactions @xcite have been recently shown @xcite to be a paradigm system for the emerging field of quantum biology @xcite , that is , the study of quantum coherence effects , or in general the study of quantum information science in the context of biological systems .",
    "the biological significance of radical - ion - pair ( rp ) reactions is twofold , ( i ) they are understood to underlie the avian magnetic compass mechanism @xcite , and ( ii ) they participate in the electron - transfer cascade reactions taking place in photosynthetic reactions centers @xcite . in any case , the experimentally founded science of spin - chemistry @xcite deals with such reactions in a wide range of chemical contexts .",
    "hence the theoretical understanding of rp reactions at the fundamental level is of importance for current experimental work in spin chemistry , for further exploring quantum effects in biological systems as well as for the design of novel , and potentially quantum - limited biomimetic devices and sensors .",
    "theoretically , the fate of radical - ion - pair reactions and all relevant predictions are fully accounted for by the time evolution of @xmath0 , the rp s spin density matrix .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath0 was until recently understood to be driven by ( i ) unitary hamiltonian evolution due to all magnetic interactions within the rp , and ( ii ) rp population loss due to spin - dependent charge recombination .",
    "we have recently shown that the spin degrees of freedom of the rp form an open quantum system , i.e. there is a third source of time evolution : ( iii ) the spin decoherence inherent in the radical - pair mechanism @xcite . moreover , since the rp is in general in a coherent ( or partially coherent ) superposition of spin states ( we refer in particular to singlet - triplet coherence ) , the description of the rp s reaction kinetics appears not to be as straightforward as originally thought . in @xcite",
    "we demonstrated that singlet - triplet ( s - t ) coherence of the rp is a central concept in understanding the intimately related effects ( i)-(iii ) and put forward a master equation satisfied by the density matrix @xmath0 .",
    "while s - t decoherence was described @xcite by first - principles perturbation theory ( similar to most applications of the theory of markovian open quantum systems leading to a lindblad decoherence term ) , the reaction kinetics had been accounted for in a phenomenological manner open to criticism .",
    "moreover , the introduction @xcite of the coherence measure @xmath1 quantifying the `` strength '' of s - t coherence was also done intuitively .    in this work",
    "we formalize our approach along both fronts previously mentioned .",
    "in particular , ( i ) we show that the measure of s - t coherence introduced in @xcite is not well - defined .",
    "we then introduce a new measure of s - t coherence based on recently appeared rigorous considerations by plenio and co - workers @xcite , ( ii ) we formally derive the reaction terms of the master equation using quantum retrodiction , a concept borrowed from the field of quantum communications , and ( iii ) we introduce monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of single - rp quantum trajectories @xcite .",
    "the mc simulation contains by design all relevant phenomena at the single - molecule level , and hence forms a unique tool to test the predictions of our master equation .",
    "we show that the new measure of s - t coherence , properly scaling with the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix , is essential for the decomposition of @xmath0 into a mixture of maximally coherent and maximally incoherent states .",
    "this decomposition underlies the retrodictive derivation of the new reaction terms , which lead to ( a ) a significantly improved agreement of the new master equation prediction with mc , and ( b ) the derivation of precise and experimentally measurable decay rates for the s - t coherence .",
    "in particular , in section iii we introduce the monte carlo simulation of single - rp quantum trajectories including only s - t decoherence and compare it with the master equation for non - recombining rps where perfect agreement is expected by definition . in section",
    "iv we elaborate on the shortcomings of our previous measure of s - t coherence and then introduce a new measure based on @xcite .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath0 into a mixture of maximally coherent and maximally incoherent states is presented in section v. this decomposition is the basis of the rigorous theory of quantum retrodiction used to derive the reaction terms of the master equation , presented in section vi . in section vii",
    "we perform a monte carlo simulation of rp quantum trajectories including recombination , comparing the trajectory - average with the prediction of our new master equation .",
    "finally , in section viii we discuss the decay of s - t coherence in a way that could be relevant to experimentally accessible observables and we compare our theory with the predictions of competing theoretical approaches . in the following section we start with a few definitions and a brief review of previous work in order to make this work as comprehensive as possible for the general reader .",
    "the quantum degrees of freedom of rps are formed by a multi - spin system embedded in a biomolecule . in particular , rps are biomolecular ions created by a charge transfer from a photo - excited d@xmath2a donor - acceptor biomolecular dyad da , schematically described by the reaction @xmath3 , where the two dots represent the two unpaired electrons of the two radicals .",
    "the excited state d@xmath2a is usually a spin zero state , hence the initial spin state of the two unpaired electrons is a singlet , denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "now , both d and a contain a number of magnetic nuclei which hyperfine - couple to the donor s and acceptor s electron , respectively , effectively creating a different magnetic environment for the two unpaired electrons .",
    "this leads to s - t mixing , i.e. a coherent oscillation of the spin state of the electrons .",
    "charge recombination terminates the reaction and leads to the formation of the neutral reaction products .",
    "angular momentum conservation at this step empowers the molecule s spin degrees of freedom and their minuscule ( relative to thermal ) energy to determine the reaction s fate : singlet state rps , @xmath4 , recombine to reform the neutral spin zero da molecules , whereas triplet rps , @xmath5 , recombine to a different ( metastable ) triplet neutral product @xmath6da . for completeness",
    "we note that the reaction can , in principle , close through the so - called intersystem crossing @xmath7 .",
    "the above are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .     and @xmath8 . the reaction can in principle",
    "close through intersystem crossing from the triplet to the singlet ground state.,width=5 ]    the straightforward part of rp dynamics are the unitary dynamics embodied in the magnetic hamiltonian @xmath9 , which mainly contains ( i ) hyperfine couplings of the donor s ( acceptor s ) electron with the donor s ( acceptor s ) nuclear spins , ( ii ) zeeman interaction of the donor s and acceptor s electrons with the externally applied magnetic field ( nuclear zeeman interaction is usually neglected ) , ( iii ) spin - exchange and dipolar interactions between the donor s and the acceptor s electron @xcite . were this a closed system ,",
    "its dynamics would be fully described by liouville s equation @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "however , it is not , hence there are more terms that make up the master equation , and they will be elaborated in the following .",
    "these terms involve two central operators , the singlet and triplet projectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . before defining them",
    ", we note that the density matrix @xmath0 describes the spin state of the rp s two electrons and @xmath13 magnetic nuclei located in d and a. the dimension of @xmath0 is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the nuclear spin of the @xmath16-th nucleus , with @xmath17 . for our numerical work",
    "we consider the simplest possible rp , namely an rp containing just one spin-1/2 nuclear spin hyperfine coupled to e.g. the donor s electron . in this case",
    "the density matrix has dimension @xmath18 .",
    "this simple model system exhibits the essential physics without the additional complication of more nuclear spins .",
    "we stress that the master equation we derive is general and equally applicable for any number of nuclear spins entering the magnetic hamiltonian @xmath9 and any sort of interactions included in @xmath9 .",
    "angular momentum conservation at the recombination process splits the rp s hilbert space into an electron singlet and an electron triplet subspace , defined by the respective projectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these are @xmath19 matrices given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the spin operators of the donor and acceptor electrons written as @xmath24-dimensional operators , e.g. the @xmath16-th component of @xmath22 is written as @xmath25 , where the first operator in the previous kronecker product refers to the donor s electron spin , the second to the acceptor s electron spin and the rest to the nuclear spins .",
    "by @xmath26 we have denoted the regular ( 2 dimensional ) spin-1/2 operators and by @xmath27 the @xmath28-dimensional unit matrix .",
    "we note that the rp s singlet subspace has dimension @xmath29 while the triplet subspace has dimension @xmath30 .",
    "the electron multiplicity 1 in the former corresponds to the singlet state @xmath31 , while the multiplicity of 3 in the latter stems from the three triplet states @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the projectors @xmath35 and @xmath12 are complete and orthogonal , i.e. @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "there are also two rates to consider , the singlet and triplet recombination rates , @xmath38 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "these are defined as follows : consider an rp ensemble with no magnetic interactions ( @xmath39 ) to be in the singlet ( triplet ) state .",
    "then its population would decay exponentially at the rate @xmath38 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "finally , in any given time interval @xmath40 , the measured singlet and triplet neutral products will be @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "these relations are simple to understand , namely in the time interval @xmath40 there would be @xmath43 singlet and @xmath44 triplet recombinations if all rps were in the singlet or triplet state , respectively .",
    "if they are in the general state described by @xmath0 , then @xmath43 and @xmath44 have to be multiplied by the respective probabilities to be in the singlet or triplet state .",
    "the initial state most often considered when doing calculations with the density matrix is the singlet electron - unpolarized nuclear spin state written as @xmath45 .      a more detailed look at the energy level structure of fig .",
    "1 reveals the picture depicted in fig .",
    "2 , where we show the vibrational excited states of the singlet and triplet ground states , which form the singlet and triplet reservoir .",
    "radical - pair recombination proceeds as a _ real _ transition of the rp to one of the quasi - resonant and quasi - continuous reservoir states .",
    "as we have demonstrated in @xcite , there can not be any coherence between the rp state and the neutral ground states , but only population transfer from the former to the latter , due to which the rp is an open system .",
    "what we have shown in @xcite is that it is `` doubly - open '' , because the same reservoir states lead to s - t decoherence . using 2@xmath46-order perturbation theory we have shown that _ virtual _ transitions to these vibrational reservoir states _ and back _ interrupt the coherent s - t mixing in individual rps and hence cause the decay of the ensemble s - t coherence .",
    "this is described with a lindblad - type and trace - preserving master equation    describes the null quantum measurement of the rp s neutral reaction products : there is a certain probability that the rp will recombine during a time interval @xmath40 .",
    "if this does not happen , i.e. if no reaction product is detected , then there are three different possibilities that could be realized within @xmath40 , ( i ) a projection to the singlet state , ( ii ) a projection to the triplet state and ( iii ) hamiltonian evolution . in the following section we present a monte carlo simulation of individual quantum trajectories and elaborate in detail on these issues .",
    "da ) ground state form a reservoir that probes the electron spin state of the rp , leading to an intramolecule measurement of @xmath35 .",
    "virtual transitions ( rates @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) to the reservoir levels and back to the rp lead to s - t decoherence , while real transitions ( rates @xmath38 and @xmath8 ) to the reservoir states followed by their decay to the ground state lead to recombination.,width=8 ]     for a model rp with one nuclear spin , taking into account only s - t decoherence and s - t mixing driven by the hamiltonian @xmath49 , where the larmor frequency is taken @xmath50 and the recombination rates are @xmath51 .",

    "( b ) average of 20,000 such trajectories ( red solid line ) , half of which have initial state @xmath52 while the other half have initial state @xmath53 .",
    "the time axis was split into 10,000 steps @xmath40 , in everyone of which one out of the three possibilities outlined in section iii was realized .",
    "the prediction of the trace - preserving master equation is shown by the black dashed line .",
    "the initial state for the density matrix was the usually considered singlet state with unpolarized nuclear spin , @xmath45.,width=8 ]",
    "as well known from quantum optics , the absence of a detection event , e.g. a photon detection , in a quantum measurement , called `` null '' measurement , also has an effect on the system s quantum state .",
    "what we have shown in @xcite is that the quantum state evolution of a non - recombining rp ( absence of detection of recombination events ) is given by the lindblad master equation .",
    "this trace - preserving master equation encompasses the following three possibilities a non - recombining rp faces during the time evolution of its quantum state : a quantum jump to the singlet state @xmath54 , taking place with probability dp_s=(k_s+k_t)dt2\\ { } a quantum jump to the triplet state @xmath55 , taking place with probability dp_t=(k_s+k_t)dt2\\ { } unitary evolution driven by the hamiltonian @xmath9 , taking place with probability @xmath56 .    in an ensemble of rps ,",
    "these single - molecule possibilities are unobservable , so we have to average over them .",
    "this averaging _",
    "exactly _ reproduces the master equation . in other words ,",
    "writing @xmath57)$ ] leads to for @xmath58 .    the physical significance of the sum @xmath59 appearing in the probabilities @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the fact that both singlet and triplet reservoirs continuously `` measure '' the same observable , namely @xmath35 .",
    "the result of this measurement is either 1 or 0 , corresponding to the singlet and triplet projections , respectively . in particular , the singlet reservoir measures the observable @xmath35 at the rate @xmath47 .",
    "the `` yes '' result of this measurement corresponds to @xmath62 and the singlet projection , while the no / null result corresponds to the triplet projection .",
    "similarly , the triplet reservoir measures the observable @xmath63 at the rate @xmath48 .",
    "the `` yes '' result of this measurement corresponds to @xmath64 and a triplet projection , while the no / null result corresponds to the singlet projection .",
    "equivalently , @xmath35 is measured at the total rate @xmath65 . again ,",
    "these measurements are unobservable and lead to the aforementioned s - t dephasing .",
    "what is observable is the detection of a neutral recombination product .",
    "the corresponding null detection implies the possibilities ( i)-(iii ) .    for testing our code and providing a `` baseline '' for the simulations of section vii we show in fig.[fig3 ] an example of an mc simulation of just the singlet - triplet decoherence described by .",
    "to simulate the quantum trajectories of non - recombining rps we start with @xmath66 rps all being in the singlet state at @xmath67 .",
    "we then evolve the state of each rp , using in each time increment @xmath40 a random number @xmath68 uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "if @xmath69 we project the rp trajectory to the singlet state , if @xmath70 we project it to the triplet state , and if @xmath71 we evolve the rp state with the hamiltonian @xmath9 . due to these random quantum jumps ,",
    "the s - t oscillations of the rps suffer dephasing , hence the trajectory - averaged expectation value of @xmath35 exhibits s - t oscillations of decaying amplitude . the perfect agreement between mc and the master equation shown in fig.[fig3]b",
    "is expected _ by definition _",
    ", i.e. the physics included in the mc simulation are those exactly reproducing the master equation .",
    "this agreement does not convey any information other than that our code is working properly and that the 10000 trajectories are statistically adequate for the comparison undertaken in the following .",
    "since @xmath72 ( the unit matrix is henceforth understood to have the dimension of the particular rp under consideration ) , any density matrix @xmath0 can be written as @xmath73 , or = _ ss+_tt+_st+_ts,[generalrho ] where @xmath74 , with @xmath75 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath76 forms the incoherent part of @xmath0 , whereas the s - t coherence is represented by @xmath77 .",
    "a naturally arising question is how coherent is a particular rp state described by some density matrix @xmath0 . consider for simplicity an imaginary 4-dimensional rp .",
    "the state @xmath78 , or equivalently @xmath79 clearly is maximally s - t coherent , whereas the state @xmath80 is maximally incoherent .",
    "there could also be an intermediate case of partial coherence , such as @xmath81 , with @xmath82 .",
    "we thus need a measure of the `` strength '' of the `` off - diagonal part '' @xmath83 of the density matrix . in @xcite",
    "we introduced the measure of coherence p_coh()=\\{_st_ts}[pcoh ] however , this definition of @xmath1 is flawed in the following sense .",
    "s - t coherence is reflected by the value of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix in the s - t basis .",
    "it is intuitively expected that such a measure should scale linearly with the off - diagonal elements , however @xmath1 scales as the square of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath0 .",
    "hence if they decay at some rate @xmath84 , @xmath1 will decay at @xmath85 , and this will skew the description of the relevant dynamics .      although essential , a rigorous quantification of coherence in quantum systems has received little attention , at least compared to the quantification of entanglement which has advanced through the definition of several measures @xcite .",
    "recently , plenio and co - workers introduced a rigorous approach to quantifying quantum coherence @xcite .",
    "we will follow this approach to introduce a new well - behaved measured of s - t coherence .",
    "the first step is to define the set of incoherent states @xmath86 . since we are interested in s - t coherence , it is straightforward to define @xmath86 as the set containing all density matrices @xmath0 for which @xmath87 , i.e. the coherences @xmath83 and @xmath88 are absent .",
    "plenio and coworkers then define a set of three criteria that any measure of coherence should satisfy .",
    "the first and most obvious ( and the one that will be used in the following ) is that @xmath89 for @xmath90 . in order not to overburden this discussion with technical details , this and",
    "the other two criteria are reproduced in appendix a , where we also demonstrate in more detail the shortcomings of our previous definition .    in the new definition of @xmath1",
    "to be shortly introduced , @xmath1 scales linearly with the off - diagonal elements of @xmath0 , as it conforms with the hilbert - schmidt norm @xmath91 shown in @xcite to be an acceptable measure of coherence . in this measure plenio and",
    "co - workers sum the absolute value of all off - diagonal elements of the density matrix .",
    "however , we are not interested in quantifying coherences within the triplet subspace , e.g. among @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "neither are we interested in nuclear spin coherences .",
    "we are only concerned with the coherence between the electron singlet and triplet subspaces .",
    "so in our new definition we will sum the absolute value of the amplitudes appearing in the coherences @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 . to do",
    "so we define ( ) = _ j=0,[crho ] this definition is visualized by a simple example in appendix b. before defining the new measure @xmath1 we note the following : ( i ) since @xmath97 is a decaying function of time due to recombination , we have to normalize @xmath98 by @xmath97 in order to get the genuine measure of coherence for the surviving rps .",
    "( ii ) as mentioned in @xcite the state of maximum coherence in a @xmath24-dimensional hilbert space with basis @xmath99 is @xmath100 . in our case ,",
    "the most general pure state of an rp can be written as @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are normalized nuclear spin states . here",
    "s - t coherence is maximum when @xmath104 , and this maximum value is @xmath105 .",
    "however , if the hamiltonian excites a subset of these coherences , e.g. only the s - t@xmath106 coherence , the maximum value of the coherence would be smaller .",
    "since in the following we use @xmath1 as a probability measure , we normalized @xmath98 with its maximum value obtained when @xmath0 evolves unitarily under the action of @xmath9 .",
    "so now we define p_coh()=1c()[pcohnew ] where @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "we note that this new definition of @xmath1 is numerically very similar to the square - root of our earlier definition .",
    "it is clear from that if we scale @xmath83 and @xmath88 with a positive number @xmath110 , i.e. if @xmath111 and @xmath112 then @xmath113 . so going back to the general form of the density matrix @xmath0 , if we choose @xmath114 , that is , if we define the density matrix _",
    "coh=_ss+_tt+1p_coh_st+1p_coh_ts[rhocoh ] , then @xmath108 will describe a maximally coherent state , @xmath115",
    ". the density matrix @xmath108 can be thought of as the s - t coherence distillation of @xmath0 .",
    "we can also define a maximally incoherent density matrix @xmath109 : _",
    "incoh=_ss+_tt,[rhoincoh ] for which @xmath116 .",
    "using eqs . , and it is then trivial to show that _ any _ density matrix @xmath0 can be written as : = ( 1-p_coh)_incoh+p_coh_coh[decomp ] this will be the starting point for the retrodictive derivation presented in the following section .",
    "we note that this general decomposition of @xmath0 into @xmath109 and @xmath108 was possible due to the particular definition of @xmath108 and its property that @xmath115 , which itself relies on the linear scaling of @xmath1 mentioned previously . in other words ,",
    "the following formal derivation based on quantum retrodiction would not be possible without the proper definition of the s - t coherence measure .",
    "the density matrix of an ensemble of @xmath117 rps is @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the spin state of the @xmath120-th rp .",
    "each @xmath121 has suffered a number of s- or t - quantum jumps until the time @xmath122 . due to recombination",
    "@xmath117 is time - dependent , since if the @xmath120-th rp recombines at time @xmath122 , its quantum state @xmath123 at time @xmath122 must be subtracted from @xmath124 in order to update @xmath124 into @xmath125 .",
    "although this is a simple physical picture from the perspective of quantum trajectories , it is not straightforward to translate it into a master equation .",
    "the root of the difficulty is s - t dephasing , which transforms a pure initial state into a mixture .",
    "as well known , there is no unique way to unravel a density matrix into its component pure states .",
    "hence we have to make due with the following physical scenario . given the density matrix @xmath124 at some time @xmath122 , and given the _ measured _ singlet and triplet neutral products during the infinitesimal interval @xmath40 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively , how do we update @xmath124 into @xmath125 ? in general , the change @xmath128 is caused by ( i ) the change of state of rps that did not recombine during @xmath40 , call it @xmath129 , given by and ( ii ) the rps that did recombine during @xmath40 , call it @xmath130 , i.e. @xmath131 . clearly , @xmath132 , but that alone can not lead to the form of @xmath130 .",
    "we will now derive @xmath130 using the formal tools of quantum retrodiction .",
    "we then compare the predictions of the new master equation to the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the latter turns out to be a very useful tool , since dealing with an ensemble of pure states allows us , by default , to subtract the particular component states @xmath121 of the recombined rps from the considered ensemble .",
    "the predictive approach to quantum measurements , which we are most familiar with , addresses the question : given the density matrix describing a physical system , what are the probabilities of specific measurement outcomes ?",
    "the so - called retrodictive approach @xcite , used less often , is about the reverse : given a specific measurement outcome , what is the probability that the system s state prior to the measurement was this or that ?",
    "quantum retrodiction is relevant to quantum communication @xcite , since bob , the receiver of quantum information , attempts to reconstruct the quantum state delivered to him by alice , the sender , based on specific measurement outcomes .",
    "the idea relating rp recombination to the concept of retrodiction and s - t coherence is the following .",
    "when an rp is in a particular state @xmath133 just before it recombines , we must subtract @xmath134 from the density matrix to account for this recombination event .",
    "but since s - t dephasing produces a mixture of pure states , given the recombination product , which is either the singlet or the triplet ground state , one can not unambiguously retrodict the pre - recombination state @xmath133 .",
    "a singlet recombination could for example result from a singlet rp as much as from an s - t coherent rp .",
    "the theory of quantum retrodiction allows us to retrodict @xmath133 `` on average '' .",
    "the way this is done depends on how coherent is the rp state described by the density matrix @xmath0 , hence the necessity of defining @xmath1 .",
    "this is seen by examining the two extreme cases of minimum and maximum s - t coherence , for which @xmath130 is straightforward to derive .",
    "based on the general decomposition , the theory of quantum retrodiction can then be seamlessly applied in the general case of a density matrix with partial s - t coherence .",
    "suppose that at time @xmath122 we have an ensemble of @xmath117 rps all in some maximally s - t coherent state @xmath133 .",
    "suppose further that the only change during the interval @xmath40 is the recombination of just one rp , i.e. the detection of one neutral product . clearly , scaling the normalization of @xmath0 from 1 to @xmath117 just for the sake of this discussion , it is @xmath135 and @xmath136 , since now we have one less rp in the state @xmath133 .",
    "this can be formalized as follows . for a maximally coherent ensemble of rps all in the same state @xmath133",
    ", the single - molecule density matrix will be @xmath137 .",

    "for the sake of completeness we present a comparison between our theory , the traditional ( or haberkorn ) approach @xcite and the theory put forward by jones & hore @xcite .",
    "first we reiterate @xcite that the traditional theory results from our theory by forcing @xmath194 .",
    "we also note that our master equation - is identical with the jones - hore equation in the case @xmath188 . in this special case",

    "it readily appears that the amplitude of the s - t oscillations in fig.[fig7]a decays faster in the jones - hore theory , slower in our theory and even slower in the traditional approach .",
    "we will now rigorously quantify this observation by following a general approach equally applicable to all three theories .",
    "this is based on the general decomposition , in particular we will consider the coherent part of @xmath0 which is @xmath195 . in our master equation @xmath196",
    "appears both in the term and in the term .",
    "the latter is obvious , while the former can be seen by simple operator manipulations leading to @xmath197 .",
    "thus , if we right ( left ) multiply the master equation - with @xmath35 ( @xmath12 ) , then vice - versa , and take the sum we find that @xmath196 obeys the equation = -i[h,]_c-_c_c[rc ] , where @xmath198_{c}={\\rm q_s}[{\\cal h},\\rho]{\\rm q_t}+{\\rm q_t}[{\\cal h},\\rho]{\\rm q_s}$ ]",
    ". the decay of @xmath196 is governed by the rate _",

    "this describes the decay of s - t coherence due to all effects other than the changing normalization of @xmath0 .",
    "this definition follows if we normalize @xmath196 by @xmath97 and then use and .",
    "then we indeed find that the decay rate of @xmath201 is @xmath202 .",
    "we now consider two cases , ( a ) @xmath203 , and ( b ) @xmath190 and @xmath204 , so that @xmath59 is the same in both cases . in case ( a )",

    ".    we will now perform the same calculation for the traditional and the jones - hore theory .",
    "we first note that the equations and are common for all three theories .",

    "b , i.e. @xmath190 and @xmath193 .",
    "( a ) the s - t coherence , embodied by the amplitude of the oscillation of @xmath191 decays faster in the jones - hore theory , slower in our theory and even slower in the traditional theory .",
    "( b ) the corresponding decay rate @xmath214 , where @xmath204.,width=8 ]    the jones - hore master equation is @xmath10-k_{\\rm s}({\\rm q_s}\\rho+\\rho{\\rm q_s}-{\\rm q_s}\\rho{\\rm q_s})-k_{\\rm t}({\\rm q_t}\\rho+\\rho{\\rm q_t}-{\\rm q_t}\\rho{\\rm q_t})$ ] .",
    "we similarly find that @xmath215 .",
    "then in case ( a ) it follows that @xmath208 and in case ( b ) @xmath216 . for clarity",
    "we summarize the results in table i.    the asymmetric case @xmath217 together with the singlet initial state is the regime of the quantum zeno effect @xcite ( most pronounced if @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is the s - t mixing frequency ) . in this regime ,",
    "when the rp s spin state is about to evolve from the initial singlet state it is strongly back - projected to it due to the high @xmath8 .",
    "thus , @xmath220 decreases slowly from its initial value of 1 , and hence @xmath221 can be quite small , in particular , quite smaller than 1/2 .",
    "this observation is common to all three theories .",
    "it thus follows that @xmath222 . indeed , as shown in fig.[fig7]b , the jones - hore theory predicts the largest decay rate for the s - t coherence , ours is intermediate and for the traditional theory it is the smallest .",
    ".decay rate of s - t coherence @xmath223 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we will finally comment on the success of the master equation - in matching the mc simulation , which has inbuilt the fundamental physical processes of rp reactions at the single - molecule level .",
    "while for the case @xmath188 there is a perfect agreement between theory and mc , independent of the particular definition of @xmath1 , for the asymmetric case @xmath217 we have the more noticeable theory - mc a deviation the higher @xmath8 is . for most practical purposes such a small deviation should be of little concern , however , it is worthwhile to discuss .    to our understanding , the problem is an underestimation of s - t coherence that in principle can be hardly overcome .",
    "the reason is the impossibility to unravel a density matrix into its component pure states .",
    "s - t decoherence will produce a mixture of s - t coherent , yet dephased states , which when described by a density matrix will look equivalent to a mixture of s - t incoherent and s - t coherent states , as we have shown with the decomposition into @xmath224 and @xmath225 . to exacerbate the problem for the sake of this discussion ,",
    "consider for example a mixture of the coherent states @xmath226 and @xmath227 with equal weights .",
    "then @xmath228 .",
    "this state appears as maximally incoherent , yet it is formed by maximally coherent states .",
    "having access to the information embodied by @xmath0 , it is impossible to unravel or retrodict the constituents @xmath229 or @xmath230 .    from it",
    "is seen that in the asymmetric case where @xmath190 , if @xmath1 is underestimated , then we remove a correspondingly larger triplet character from @xmath0 , and hence @xmath0 appears to be more singlet than it really is , as is evident from fig.[fig6 ] , i.e. the master equation overshoots the mc .",
    "moreover , this deviation is noticeable at the minima of @xmath1 , while it is indiscernible at the maxima of @xmath1 .",
    "again , this is due to the reaction term of the master equation , which is more pronounced for low values of @xmath1 .",
    "we finally reiterate that what we have treated is the fundamental quantum dynamics of rp reactions governed by the physical processes inherent in the radical - pair mechanism , i.e. s - t dephasing and charge recombination , stemming from virtual and real transitions to the products vibrational reservoirs , respectively .",
    "clearly , other sources of decoherence could be present , which are either fundamental or technical , and the manifestation of which could depend on the physical realization of the rp dynamics , e.g. whether the molecules are in solution or in the solid state as in photosynthetic reaction centers .",
    "dephasing due to a bath of surrounding nuclear spins that have not been included in the magnetic hamiltonian has analogues in the study of quantum dots @xcite and has been considered by several authors @xcite . to our understanding ,",
    "a consensus on the physical significance and the quantitative details of this hyperfine relaxation is still lacking from the literature . whether the s - t dephasing we consider is a dominant process or not will at the end depend on the comparison between the particular recombination rates @xmath38 and @xmath8 of the rp under consideration and the hyperfine relaxation rate , or in general , the rates of other relaxation processes in the particular rp environment .",
    "a detailed understanding of the interplay of all possible decoherence mechanisms , whether fundamental or technical , is outside the scope of this work .",
    "it is , however , a basic requirement for connecting the microscopic dynamics of rp reactions with behavioral observations of the avian compass mechanism , a non - trivial exercise recently undertaken in @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have used formal considerations for quantifying the strength of singlet - triplet coherence in radical - ion pairs , which is central for understanding their quantum state evolution .",
    "we have also applied the formalism of quantum retrodiction to provide a theoretically solid basis for deriving the master equation for radical - ion - pair quantum dynamics .",
    "this represents a refinement of our previous work , which is substantiated by monte carlo simulations .",
    "these have their own interest as they can realistically and precisely simulate the dynamics of rp reactions including all relevant physical processes . for most practical purposes ,",
    "however , the master equation we derive should be adequate .",
    "this work is about the self - consistency of our approach and not about making the case of which among the competing theories is the correct one . in other words , if the model presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is a physically adequate model for describing rps , as we believe it is , our newly introduced master equation represents a first - principles result alleviating problems with our previous phenomenological treatment .",
    "nevertheless , we have compared the predictions of our approach with the other two competing theories and discussed in detail how all three theories describe the decay of s - t coherence , which is a central observable in rp reactions .      according to @xcite , any measure of coherence , @xmath231 ,",
    "should satisfy the following requirements .",
    "( c1 ) @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "( c2 ) @xmath231 should be monotonous under all incoherent positive and trace - preserving maps , i.e. @xmath232 , where the map @xmath233 is defined by a set of kraus operators @xmath234 .",
    "these satisfy @xmath235 and @xmath236.(c3 ) there is a stronger requirement , namely that @xmath231 is monotonous under selective measurements _ on average _ , namely @xmath237 , where @xmath238 , again with @xmath235 and @xmath236 . the probability to select @xmath239 in the measurement defined by @xmath234 is @xmath240 .",
    "we can now demonstrate that the previously defined measure is not a good measure of s - t coherence .",
    "an s - t decoherence process can be described by the following kraus operators , @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "this set of operators has the effect of scaling @xmath83 and @xmath88 by the factor @xmath244 .",
    "we would expect that the measure of coherence also scales by @xmath110 , however , defining @xmath245 we easily find that @xmath246 when using definition for @xmath1 . put differently , the measure is similar to the squared hilbert - schmidt norm @xmath247 , which does not satisfy @xcite the strong monotonicity criterion ( c3 ) .      to visualize the definition of @xmath98 in",
    "we consider a simple example of an s - t coherent state of a single - nucleus rp , e.g. @xmath248 .",
    "the corresponding density matrix is @xmath249 we wish to pick the amplitude @xmath250 of the s - t off - diagonal term in eq .",
    ", i.e. the third term .",
    "this can be done as follows . in this simple example @xmath251 . if we right - multiply @xmath83 with @xmath252 we are left with @xmath253 .",
    "if we then right - multiply @xmath68 with @xmath254 and take the trace of the resulting expression it readily follows that @xmath255 . in the general case we will have @xmath256 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 coherences , hence the definition .",
