    "electron correlations in narrow bands have attracted much attention after the discovery of high t@xmath0 cuprate superconductors .",
    "since a thorough study of electron correlations is quite complicated in actual materials , we often use a simplified model to understand the essence of the effects .",
    "one of the most widely used models is the hubbard model , @xcite whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 stands for the nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "operator @xmath4 represents the annihilation of an electron with spin @xmath5 at site @xmath6 .    in the low density of occupied electrons ,",
    "the correlation effects on this model are exactly taken into account by considering the multiple scattering between two electrons . using this low - density theory ,",
    "kanamori@xcite studied the ferromagnetism of nickel metal ( here holes are in low density ) .",
    "he found that the effective interaction between electrons is considerably reduced from the bare value @xmath7 due to the correlated motion avoiding each other , and that the stoner condition for ferromagnetism is strongly modified . in order to extend his theory to higher density , we need to include also the effects of the particle - hole multiple scattering , which describes the magnon excitation on the ferromagnetic ground state , and those of the electron - magnon interaction .",
    "hertz and edwards@xcite recognized the importance of the vertex correction , and determined the electron - magnon vertex by enforcing the ward - takahashi identity.@xcite however , it is impossible to determine the vertex on all points in the momentum - frequency space by the identity alone , and also it is unclear how to include the particle - particle multiple - scattering effect , which becomes important in the low density of electrons .",
    "one of the present author has proposed a theory@xcite which takes account of the multiple scattering between two electrons and one hole with the use of the faddeev equation of the three - body problem.@xcite this theory naturally takes account of the particle - particle and particle - hole multiple - scattering channels on equal footing , and thereby it contains the effect interpreted as the vertex correction for the electron - magnon interaction .",
    "the three - body scattering theory has a clear meaning of the three - body problem on the saturated ferromagnetic ground state , although it is applicable to the paramagnetic phase by deriving a similar integral equation to the faddeev equation . in this paper , in order to make clear the physical meaning and the reliability of the approximation , we confine ourselves to the application to the two - dimensional hubbard model in the context of the instability of the saturated ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "it has a nice property interpolating from the low - density limit to the half - filling limit , and satisfies the exact atomic limit@xcite as previously proved.@xcite one of the present authors@xcite has already applied the three - body scattering theory to the one - dimensional hubbard model in comparison with the exact solution , having calculated the spectral function for the single - particle green s function .",
    "later ruckenstein and schmitt - rink@xcite have examined the same approach in comparison with other theories .",
    "however , the actual calculation in two dimensions has not been carried out yet . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the single - particle green s function in two dimensions and determine the quasi - particle energy .",
    "we demonstrate the importance of the three - body correlation by comparison with the ladder approximation .",
    "we find that a low - energy scale for the quasi - particle energy , which is much smaller than its value of the ladder approximation , and that the mass enhancement factor is as large as @xmath8 in the strong coupling regime .",
    "we discuss several limiting cases for clarifying the approximation made .",
    "we also show that the present theory satisfies the variational principle .",
    "@xcite this observation helps us to compare the present theory to other variational theories .    as regards the stability of saturated ferromagnetism , nagaoka considered in his pioneering study the case of one hole in an",
    "otherwise half - filled band with @xmath9.@xcite he proved that the saturated ferromagnetism is realized as ground state on appropriate lattices due to gaining the kinetic enegy of the hole . for two holes on a square lattice with @xmath9 , fang _",
    "et al._@xcite found that the ground state is a singlet by exact diagonalizations for small clusters .",
    "doucot and wen@xcite found that a long - wave length twisted spin state has lower energy than the saturated ferromagnetic state . on the other hand",
    ", it has been noticed that finite - size effects are crucial and that closed - shell configurations ( numbers of holes are 1 , 5 , 9 , @xmath10 ) favor ferromagnetism whereas open - shell configurations ( numbers of holes are 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , @xmath10 ) tend to destabilize it.@xcite quantum monte carlo results suggest no ferromagnetic phase for intermediate @xmath7,@xcite but the cluster sizes used and the simulation temperatures are rather high .",
    "therefore , for a thermodynamic concentration of holes , such considerations for a few holes do not serve as proper guides .    another route to investigate the stability of the nagaoka ground state is a variational study for the excitation energy with respect to overturning an up - spin electron and placing it on a down - spin band .",
    "of course this approach gives only an upper limit for the ferromagnetic boundary .",
    "roth@xcite was the first to discuss in detail the instability of the nagaoka ground state with an approximate scheme equivalent to using a variational wave function .",
    "it is found superior to the gutzwiller function , since it has more variational flexibility.@xcite the similar variational wave function was employed by shastry , krishnamurthy , and anderson,@xcite for discussing the instability of the nagaoka ground state and the spin - wave stiffness .",
    "it was also used to calculate the spin - wave spectrum with general momentum in the @xmath9 limit by basile and elser@xcite , and for finite @xmath7 by okabe.@xcite the softening of the spin - wave energy may set another condition for the instability of the nagaoka state .",
    "these calculations leads to an instability for a finite concentration of holes even in the @xmath9 limit .",
    "another interesting variational wave function is constructed by richmond and rickayzen,@xcite who froze the motion of the down - spin electron and solved exactly the states for up - spin electrons under the static potential due to the down - spin electron ( see appendix b ) .",
    "this study merely leads to the conclusion that the nagaoka state is always stable in the @xmath9 limit for any concentrations of holes .",
    "recently , hanish , uhlig , and mller - hartman@xcite analyzed roth s wave function and its slight extension on various lattices , and calculated the phase diagram for the nagaoka ground state .",
    "the present theory is shown to be equivalent to using a variational wave function similar to roth s but assuming the most general form with the states containing one particle - hole pair .",
    "it is more flexible than that of hanish _",

    "a , the explicit solution of the faddeev equation is derived in the @xmath9 limit , and in the appendix b the method of richmond and rickayzen is adapted for numerical computations .",

    "we also discuss the variational character of the theory .",
    "we start by assuming the saturated ferromagnetic ground state , where only up - spin states are occupied by electrons .",
    "no interaction is working between electrons with the same spin . placing a down - spin electron into the system , we study its motion using the single - particle green s function .",
