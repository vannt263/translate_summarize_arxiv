    "continuous gravitational signals emitted by rotating asymmetric neutron stars are promising sources for interferometric gravitational wave detectors like geo @xcite , ligo @xcite , tama300 @xcite and virgo @xcite .",
    "the detectability of a source , emitting due to a deviation of its shape from axi - symmetry , basically depends on the detector sensitivity , on the source rotation frequency , distance and ellipticity . not less important for the feasibility of the search",
    "are , however , also the source position in the sky and spin - down rate . up to now",
    "about 1500 neutron stars , most of which are pulsars , have been detected in the galaxy through their electromagnetic emission .",
    "standard theory of stellar evolution suggests that about @xmath0 neutron stars should exist in the galaxy and , of these , about @xmath1 should be active pulsars .",
    "we detect only a small fraction of this subset because either the radio beam does not intersect our visual line or the intensity of the emission is too low .",
    "in fact , the sample of detected pulsars is increasing as the sensitivity of the surveys increases . for most of these stars the rotation frequency , the spin - down rate ,",
    "the location in the sky and the distance are known , while the ellipticity is completely uncertain .",
    "this makes difficult to get reliable estimates of their gravitational emission . an upper limit to the ellipticity , and then to the amplitude of the emitted gravitational signals , is tipically given assuming that all the observed spin - down is due to the emission of gravitational waves . in this case",
    "@xmath2 , being @xmath3 respectively the rotation period and its first time derivative and , for most normal pulsars , values of the order of @xmath4 are obtained . using this assumption , in fig.([pulsar1 ] )",
    "we show the effective amplitude of the gravitational wave signals emitted by the presently known isolated pulsars , after using _ optimal _ filtering techniques and four months of observation time , versus the target sensitivity of the virgo detector and a possible sensitivity curve of an advanced virgo detector @xcite .",
    "similar plots can be obtained for the ligo interferometers .",
    "it comes out that very few observed pulsars would be on the verge of detectability , for the first generation of interferometers .",
    "tens of pulsars would be detected by an advanced detector .",
    "and that obtained assuming the observed spin - down is completely due to the emission of gravitational radiation.,width=317 ]    on the other hand , as it is well known , it is quite likely that true ellipticities are much lower than the upper limits . according to @xcite",
    "the maximum ellipticity is probably @xmath5 .",
    "this makes rather unlikely the detection of gravitational waves from the observed pulsar population : fig.([pulsar2 ] ) is the same as fig.([pulsar1 ] ) but taking the ellipticity as the minimum between @xmath6 and the value obtained assuming only gravitational spin - down .",
    "the observed spin - down of millisecond pulsars implies a maximum ellipticity less than @xmath7 , which is a plausible value . in this case",
    "we see that no detection is expected for the first generation of interferometers while few sources ( 4 at present ) , all millisecond recycled pulsars , could be detected by an advanced detector . by the way , also this is just an upper limit .",
    "nevertheless , the search for gravitational signals from known neutron stars is an important task because , even if no detection should come , we can at least put upper limits on the neutron stars ellipticity , thus increasing our knowledge on the neutron star structure .",
    "an alternative possibility is the existence of a population of asymmetric rotating neutron stars with magnetic field low enough so that the spin - down is dominated by the emission of gravitational waves . for such objects ,",
    "as the electromagnetic emission does not contribute much or at all to the spin - down , a larger amount of gravitational radiation would be emitted in a given period of observation , in comparison to a standard pulsar with the same degree of deformation .",
    "obviously , it would be very difficult to detect this kind of neutron stars in the electromagnetic band , unless very near and young ( through their thermal emission ) or very near and interacting with the interstellar medium . hence the necessity of performing a _ blind search _ in the data of gravitational detectors ,",
    "i.e. without strong assumptions on the position of the objects , on their rotation frequency and spin - down rate .",
    "the existence of such class of stars , which for simplicity we call gwdns ( gravitational wave driven neutron stars ) or _ gravitars _ , can not be excluded both on observational and theoretical basis .",
    "for instance , the lack of a one - to - one correspondence between observed supernovae and observed compact remnants leaves room for a non negligible formation rate for gwdns . in this context",
    ", the presence of a low magnetic field neutron star has been recently suggested for the remnants of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "gwdns could be a subset of pulsars born with a very low magnetic field or the product of a different evolutionary channel .",
    "different mechanisms , like magnetic axis alignement , the freezing of the magnetic field in a newborn neutron star or magnetic field decay , could permit the existence of gwdns .    in this work",
    "we perform a monte carlo simulation of a possible gwdns population , estimating the number of expected detections with the first and planned second generation of gravitational interferometers .",
    "several simulations of the neutron star or pulsar population , evolving through standard dipolar magnetic emission , have been published @xcite . only in few cases",
    "the detection of gravitational waves has been discussed @xcite .",
    "the existence of a population of neutron stars whose dynamical evolution is dominated by the emission of gravitational waves has been addressed by @xcite but , as far as we know , no attempt has been done , up to now , to make a quantitative study of the problem .",
    "we do not have an observed population against which the simulated one can be checked so that different choices for the parameters are done and the dependency of the results on them is discussed .",
    "the initial position and kick velocity are described by the probability distributions typically used to simulate the standard pulsar population . the contribution to the total neutron star formation rate due to the gould belt",
    "is taken into account and three different distributions for the initial rotation period are considered .",
    "the mean value of the ellipticity , distributed exponentially , is taken between @xmath9 and @xmath6 and the abundance of gwdns , expressed as fraction of the whole galactic neutron star population , is considered as a free parameter . given the initial spatial , initial period and birth kick velocity distributions , gwdns are evolved solving the equations of motion in the galactic gravitational potential , assumed axisymmetric for simplicity . the stars age in drawn from a uniform distribution back to 100 myr ( or 500 myr , when advanced detectors are considered ) .",
    "once the population has been evolved to the present , the detectability of the emitted continuous gravitational signals is estimated , for the first and planned second generation of interferometric detectors , assuming that a _ blind _",
    "search is done .",
    "this is mandatory because , contrary to what happens in _ targeted _ search where the source parameters are well constrained , here we need to explore a large portion of the source parametrer space .",
    "this implies that _ optimal _ data analysis methods can not be applied , due to the unrealistic amount of computing resources they would require .",
    "non optimal procedures , with reduced sensitivity but allowing to strongly cut the computational weigth of the analysis , are therefore needed .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "in section 2 we review the main relations concerning the time evolution of neutron stars rotation period due to the presence of a dipolar magnetic field or of an asymmetry in the star shape . in section 3 the sensitivity of a _ blind _",
    "search for the gravitational waves emitted by asymmetric rotating neutron stars is given .",
    "in section 4 the monte carlo simulation model is presented and in section 5 the results of the simulations are discussed . in section 6",
    "we describe some possible mechanisms which could leave space to a non negligible fraction of gwdns . in section",
    "7 conclusions are drawn .",
    "finally , in the appendix we compare the gravitational spin - down of a neutron star with the spin - down due to its possible interaction with the interstellar medium .",
    "the spin - down rate of a neutron star can be expressed , in the general case , as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the rotation pulsation , @xmath12 are the _ braking indexes _ which depend on the spin - down mechanisms at work and @xmath13 are constants depending on the neutron star structure and characteristics . in the case of simple electromagnetic dipolar emission eq.([omegadot",
    "] ) becomes @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the magnitude of the dipolar magnetic field , @xmath16 is the angle between the magnetic axis and the rotation axis , @xmath17 is the neutron star radius and @xmath18 is the star momentum of inertia . if the evolution is dominated by the emission of gravitational waves in a non - axysimmetric neutron star , we have @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the star ellipticity , being @xmath21 the star momenta of inertia along three principal axes . from this equation the rotation frequency as a function of time can be expressed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the initial rotation period .",
    "the final frequency is independent on the initial period if the inequality @xmath24 is satisfied and , in such a case , the rotation frequency at present is @xmath25 we note that even very old and rather highly deformed gwdns can continue to spin to a rather high frequency at present .",
    "gwdns only slightly deformed can maintain nearly unchanged their rotation frequency along their whole life .",
    "we are interested in comparing the contributions to the spin - down rate due to the emission of gravitational waves and to the presence of a dipolar magnetic field . in this way we can establish which condition",
    "the magnetic field must satisfy in order to have a gwdns .",
    "let us introduce @xcite the ratio among the gravitational and the dipolar field induced spin - down rates , expressed by eqs.([omegadotgw],[omegadotem ] ) : @xmath26 the condition @xmath27 corresponds to @xmath28 obviously , this relation is less stringent for high values of the neutron star ellipticity and frequency and small values of the angle @xmath16 . in order to have a gwdns",
    "is not sufficient that the condition @xmath29 is satisfied at the birth . due to the spin - down ,",
    "the ratio @xmath30 , even if @xmath31 at the beginning , decreases in time and could go below @xmath32 , unless the magnetic field decays or the magnetic axis aligns to the rotation axis .",
    "these possibilities will be discussed in section 6 .",
    "assuming that the `` non - gravitational '' spin - down is described by eq.([omegadotem ] ) , we are implicitly considering a neutron star in the so - called _ ejector _ phase @xcite .",
    "this is the evolutionary stage to which pulsars belong .",
    "note , however , that not all _ ejectors _ are pulsars .",
    "two other phases are foreseen for neutron stars having small values of the magnetic field and/or long rotation periods : _ propeller _ and _ accretor_. in these phases an interaction of the star with the sorrounding interstellar medium takes place and in the appendix we will see that , unless the magnetic field is nearly vanishing , the spin - down rate in these stages is dominated , for @xmath33 , by the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "the gravitational wave signal emitted by an asymmetric neutron star , rotating around one of its principal axis of inertia , has a frequency twice the rotation frequency and the amplitude at the detector , assuming optimal orientation , can be expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the gravitational wave frequency and @xmath36 the distance from the detector . from eq.([ftime ] ) , assuming @xmath37 , most gwdns emit gravitational waves with frequency @xmath38 , independently of their age , i.e. within the sensitivity band of interferometric detectors .",
    "however , we will see in section [ res ] that almost all gwdns producing signals detectable by the first generation of interferometric detectors are younger than @xmath39 .",
    "the expected amplitude of the gravitational signals is so low that they will be typically buried in the detector noise .",
    "then , very long integration times ( of the order of months ) and suitable data analysis techniques are needed to extract them .",
    "it is important to take into account that the signal `` seen '' by the detector is not really monochromatic due to the source spin - down and the doppler effect associated to the detector motion .",
    "moreover , the search for gwdns must be necessarily _ blind _ , that is it must be performed on a large portion of the source parameter space , because we can not put strong constraints on their position in the sky , on their rotation frequency and on their spin - down rate .",
    "this means , in practice , that we want to search sources everywhere on the celestial sphere ( _ full - sky _ search ) , with signal frequencies from the low frequency cut - off of interferometers up to about @xmath40 , and a spin - down rate as large as possible , compatibly with the available computing resources .",
    "such kind of analysis can not be performed with the classical _ optimal _ methods used in gravitational wave experiments , based on the so - called _ matched filter _ , which can be used for _ targeted _ searches @xcite , but that are unfeasible for wide area searches , due to the enormous computing power they would require .",
    "alternative , non optimal , methods have been developed by various groups in the world @xcite . they reach a lower level of sensitivity but strongly cut the needed computational power .",
    "all these methods are based on some kind of alternation of coherent and incoherent steps , these last typically based on the radon @xcite or hough transform @xcite . in the hierarchical method developed by our group @xcite the amplitude of the smallest detectable signal , with signal - to - noise ratio @xmath41 ,",
    "is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the detector noise power density , measured in @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the total observation time , and @xmath46 is the time duration of the _ short _ ffts computed from the data at the beginning .",
    "@xmath46 varies between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , depending on the frequency band which is analyzed .",
    "the _ loss factor _",
    "@xmath49 is a number around 2 , which exact value depends on the analyzed frequency band , on the number of candidates which are selected after the first incoherent step and on the assumed minimum spin - down decay time .",
    "the larger is the available computing power and the wider can be the search . a computing power of about 1 teraflops will allow to perform a _ full - sky _ analysis of @xmath50 months of data , searching sources emitting signals with frequencies up to @xmath40 and with a spin - down time @xmath51 .    from eqs.([h0],[sensi ] ) we can derive the maximum distance @xmath52 at which a source , emitting gravitational waves at a given frequency and with a given ellipticity , can be detected . in fig.([rmax ] ) @xmath52 is plotted as a function of the frequency for different values of the ellipticity .",
    "a total observation time of @xmath50 months is considered and the target virgo sensitivity is used .",
    "the discontinuities are due to the fact that different values of the @xmath53 duration , @xmath54 , are used for different frequency bands .    , @xmath0 candidates selected after the first incoherent step .",
    "the different curves corresponds to different values of the star ellipticity , starting from @xmath6 ( upper curve ) to @xmath55 ( lower curve ) .",
    "[ rmax],width=317 ]    looking at the figure we see that if @xmath37 and if the maximum rotation frequency we search for is @xmath56 , the maximum distance at which a source can be detected , in a _ blind _",
    "search , is about @xmath57 . on the other side , assuming that no neutron star is located at a distance from the earth less than @xmath58 , the minimum ellipticity needed to have a detectable source ( emitting at the high end of the allowed frequency range ) is @xmath59 : no source can be detected , not even in principle , if its ellipticity is less than that value .",
    "if the typical ellipticity is in the range @xmath60 we would need to have sources located in the solar neighbourhood and rotating at high rate .",
    "moreover , sources with rotation frequency less than @xmath61 can not be detected , indipendently of the ellipticity . in section 5",
    "we will see that detected sources in the simulation have parameters in a narrower range .",
    "in this section we describe the model used to simulate the population of gwdns in the galaxy .",
    "as we do not have any observational clue on what the parameters distribution of gwdns could be , we use for initial position and kick velocity the same distributions typically used for pulsars .",
    "three different models are considered for the distribution of initial periods .",
    "the ellipticity follows an exponential distribution with mean value treated as a parameter .",
    "obviously we can not exclude that gwdns have parameters distributed in a completely different way .",
    "we take the distance of the sun from the galactic centre as @xmath62 .",
    "we assume that the initial space distribution is described by two exponentials in the radial distance from the galatic centre , @xmath63 , and in the height over the galactic plane @xmath64 : @xmath65 with scale factor @xmath66 , and @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "the results of the simulations are rather insensitive to the choice of the scale factors .",
    "the initial right ascension , @xmath69 , is chosen from a uniform distribution between 0 and @xmath70 .",
    "the angle is measured respect to the direction between the galactic centre and the sun . with these choices",
    "we find that about @xmath71 neutron stars were born in the galactic disk up to a distance of @xmath72 from the sun in the last @xmath73 ( assuming a neutron star formation rate of @xmath74 ) , in good agreement with @xcite .",
    "the presence of the gould belt is also taken into account .",
    "it is described as a thin disk with radius of @xmath75 and thickness @xmath76 , tilted of @xmath77 respect to the galactic plane and centered at @xmath78 from the sun in the galactic anticenter direction @xcite .",
    "the gould belt is characterized by an overabundance of massive stars and its age is about @xmath79 .",
    "following @xcite , we assume a constant star formation rate inside the belt of @xmath80 neutron star per myr . to mimic the observed lack of massive stars in the central region of the gould belt , we assume that no neutron star was born in its central region up to a distance of @xmath81 from the center @xcite .",
    "we find that a fraction @xmath82 of the neutron star population with age less than @xmath79 was formed in the solar neighbourhood , at a distance from the sun less than @xmath83 , and this is in agreement with the result of @xcite .",
    "we assume that the distribution of the modulus of the kick velocity @xmath84 imparted to neutron stars at birth is that given by @xcite : @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 . the angles @xmath89 , defining the direction of the kick velocity vector , are drawn from uniform distributions between , respectively , @xmath90 and @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "we use three different models for the initial period distribution .",
    "the first one is a _ standard _ log - normal distribution @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "gwdns with @xmath95 are excluded from the simulation .",
    "the second model is like the first one but we set to @xmath96 all initial periods shorter than this value . in this way",
    "we try to mimic the possible presence of excited _ r - modes _",
    "@xcite which could rapidly increase the rotation period of a fast rotating newborn neutron star .",
    "according to @xcite , see section 3 of their paper , the final period of a newborn neutron star , once the _ r - modes _ have become stable , is between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , depending on the cooling scenario .",
    "we take @xmath96 as a intermediate value .",
    "the third model consists of a uniform distribution of periods between @xmath99 and @xmath100 , mimicing in this way the combined effect of _ r - modes _ , which tend to increase the rotation period , and of the matter fall - back after supernova explosion which , on the other hand , increases the star angular momentum .",
    "according to @xcite , the resulting period after one year or so , is largely independent on the period at birth and depends mainly on the neutron star magnetic field , with lower magnetic field and lower _ r - modes _ saturation amplitude resulting in lower periods ( see section 4 of their paper and , in particular , figures 2 and 4 ) .",
    "they find that neutron stars with magnetic field @xmath101 have final rotation periods , about one year after the supernova explosion , somewhere between @xmath102 and @xmath98 . for gwdns we could expect substantially lower values , but given all the uncertainties we prefer to take the period uniformly distributed in that range .",
    "the age of gwdns is chosen from a uniform distribution between 0 and @xmath103 or @xmath104 .",
    "the reason for these choices is the following .",
    "we have computed the present frequency distribution of the signals emitted by a population of gwdns , evolving according to eq.([ftime ] ) , for different values of the star ellipticity and assuming a maximum age @xmath105 . from fig.([fgwfin ] ) we see that most of the sources emit in the detector frequency bandwidth , even for high values of the ellipticity .",
    "then , in principle , we should simulate the population of gwdns with ages up to the age of the galaxy . in practice , however , we have verified that all detected sources in the simulation have ages much lower than that . in the case of the initial virgo detector ,",
    "in particular , most detectable sources have age less than about @xmath106 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that mainly fast rotating ( and then young ) objects can produce detectable signals .",
    "as already said in section 3 , detectable gwdns typically belong to the solar neighbourhood ( see section 5.1 for a more quantitative discussion ) . a typical neutron star with a kick velocity of about @xmath107 will move , in that time , of about @xmath83 respect to the sun .",
    "then , considering also the over production of neutron stars in the gould belt , sources today in the solar neighbourhood are likely to be born in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "to be conservative , we have chosen @xmath108 for the first generation of interferometric detectors and @xmath109 for advanced detectors .",
    "assuming a constant neutron star gslsctic formation rate of @xmath110 we have that @xmath111 neutron stars have been formed in the last @xmath103 ( or @xmath112 in @xmath104 ) .",
    "the number of gwdns will be a fraction @xmath113 of @xmath114 that we treat as a free parameter .",
    "@xmath115 is the number of neutron stars we have used in the simulations .    , for different fixed values of the star ellipticity.[fgwfin],width=317 ]",
    "the typical ellipticity of neutron stars is largely unknown and also the allowed maximum value , depending on the properties of matter at very high densities , is very uncertain . at present , maximum values @xmath116 are considered plausible @xcite .",
    "we cope with our poor knowledge by using , for the ellipticity , the probability distribution which satisfies the _ principle of maximum entropy _ , that is that leaves us with the largest uncertainty , without introducing any additional assumption or bias . the probability distribution @xmath117 maximizing the differential entropy @xmath118 , under the constraint that the expectation value is given , is the exponential distribution @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the maximum possible value for @xmath121 .",
    "the relation between @xmath122 and the mean value of the distribution , @xmath123 , is @xmath124 in the simulation , chosen a value for the mean ellipticity @xmath125 , the parameter @xmath122 is calculated numerically using the previous equation . with the choice @xmath126 , the maximum mean value is @xmath6 . in section 5 , we will report results , concerning the detection rate , for the different initial period distributions and for mean ellipticities @xmath127 .",

    "this system of two equations of the second order can be reduced to a system of four equations of the first order which we numerically solve with initial conditions @xmath148 using a fifth order runge - kutta method with adaptive step size . in the trajectory of each star",
    "the total energy is conserved to better than one part in @xmath149 .",
    "we have done several simulations of a population of @xmath150 gwdns using the probability distributions previously described .",
    "@xmath115 is the number of neutron stars we expect to be born in the galaxy in the last @xmath103 , assuming a constant formation rate of @xmath151 , see the discussion in section 4.4 . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] the properties of the different models are summarized .",
    ".summary of model parameters .",
    "concerning the initial period distribution function , @xmath152 , `` standard '' refers to the period distribution described by eq.([p0dist ] ) ; `` r - modes '' corresponds to the same period distribution of model 1 but in which all periods less than @xmath96 are set to @xmath96 , while `` r - modes+fall - back '' describes a uniform distribution between @xmath99 and @xmath100 , see section [ initper ] for a detailed description.[tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in tab.([tab5 ] ) we have reported , for each initial period distribution function and for three different values of the fraction @xmath113 , the minimum value of the neutron star mean ellipticity needed in order to have at least one detectable source ; the minimum allowed fraction @xmath153 , assuming @xmath154 , is also shown .",
    "a value @xmath155 would allow us to detect sources with mean ellipticity as small as @xmath156 . even for @xmath157 we could still have a detection , if the mean ellipticity is @xmath158 and if the period distribution were described bt the `` standard '' model . if @xmath154 , the minimum needed fraction varies between @xmath159 and @xmath160 , depending on the initial period distribution .",
    "gwdns could be the result of an evolutionary path different from that of pulsars or could belong to the same population of pulsars , but with a very low dipolar magnetic field .",
    "such a low magnetic field could be produced by several mechanisms some of which are now shortly discussed .    according to @xcite ,",
    "post core - collapse hypercritical accretion can submerge any initial magnetic field of the newborn neutron star , because the ram pressure at the star surface is much larger than the magnetic field pressure .",
    "later diffusion of the magnetic field could produce a delayed switch - on of a pulsar , with timescale up to millions of years .",
    "there are , however , many possible factors which could reduce or even suppress the fall - back , like a high kick velocity or the injection of rotational energy in the highly dirty environment of the new - born neutron star .",
    "it is not possible at present to estimate which fraction of newborn neutron stars undergoes a phase of hypercritical accretion . as most detected objects have , in our simulations , ages below @xmath39 ( particularly in the case of the inital virgo detector ) , this mechanism could be efficient in producing a population of gwdns .",
    "if the magnetic field of neutron stars is associated with the alignement of the magnetic moment of neutrons in the stellar crust , the orientation of the magnetic field will be influenced by the coupling between intrinsic spin and gravitational field of the star .",
    "this coupling induces the alignement of the magnetic axis respect to the rotation axis @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , @xcite have shown that the timescale of alignement is inversely porpoprtional to the magnetic field strength and proportional to the pulsar initial period . as a consequence",
    ", the inclination angles of weak field - short initial period pulsars should concentrate toward lower values .",
    "the relation they find for the time evolution of the inclination angle @xmath16 is @xmath161=f[\\alpha(0)]-0.023\\left({b_{in}\\over { 10^{12}~g}}\\right)^{-1}\\left({b\\over { 10^{12}~g}}\\right)^{-2}\\ln{\\left({p(t)\\over p_0}\\right ) } \\label{alphat}\\ ] ] where @xmath162=\\alpha-{1\\over 2}\\sin{2\\alpha}$ ] and @xmath163 is the star inner field .",
    "a third possible mechanism is the decay of the neutron star magnetic field .",
    "as it is well known , the time evolution of the magnetic field in isolated neutron stars is still a controversial issue .",
    "a firm point is that the observation of radio pulsars rules out decay times less than @xmath164 but larger decay times are still possible .",
    "the faster is the decay of the magnetic field and the larger is the fraction of gwdns in the neutron star population .",
    "in this paper we have described the monte carlo simulation of a population of asymmetric neutron star which evolve through the emission of gravitational waves and have estimated the detectability of the emitted continuous gravitational signals . as far as we know ,",
    "a quantitative study of this kind of sources has not been done before .",
    "some important features of this work are : neutron star ellipticity is not considered a constant , but distributed according to an exponential law ; the presence of the gould belt is taken into account ; the number of detectable sources is estimated assuming a realistic data analysis method is applied ( in fact , the analysis method we will apply to the data of the virgo detector , once they will be available ) .",
    "we have performed the simulation for values of the neutron star mean ellipticity between @xmath6 and @xmath9 and for three different models of the initial rotation period distribution corresponding , respectively , to a `` standard '' pulsar population , to a population of neutron stars spun - down by _ r - modes _ and to a population subject , after the supernova explosion , to the combined effect of _ r - modes _ and matter fall - back .",
    "the number of detections is estimated using the virgo target sensitivity and a possible sensitivity curve of an advanced virgo detector .",
    "no large difference is expected for ligo interferometers because very few sources are likely to be detected in the low frequency range , say below @xmath165 , where the target sensitivity of virgo is much better than that of ligo .",
    "we do not have any clue of what the number of gwdns could be , then the number of detectable sources is parametrized by the fraction @xmath113 of the total neutron star population made of this kind of objects .",
    "for detectors of the first generation , we need a fraction @xmath166 to have one detectable source , for @xmath167 .",
    "smaller values , @xmath168 , require a fraction @xmath113 as high as @xmath169 .",
    "the expected number of detections for advanced interferometers is about two orders of magnitude larger than that we find for initial detectors .",
    "this means that , assuming a value for @xmath113 , for advanced detectors the minimum detectable mean ellipticity is much smaller or , viceversa , for a given value of the mean ellipticity , the minimum needed fraction of neutron stars being gwdns , in order to have at least one detectable source , is much lower .",
    "we find that a value of @xmath113 as small as @xmath170 is enough to have one detectable source for high mean ellipticities , while if @xmath171 , the minimum needed mean ellipticity is of the order of @xmath9 .    in principle ,",
    "gwdns as old as the galaxy could contribute to the detected population , because for many objects the slow gravitational spin - down does not bring the signal frequency below the detector low frequency cut - off even for age of the order of @xmath172",
    ". however , in practice detectable sources are often very young , especially in the case of interferometers of the first generation , with ages of few megayears or less . for many models ,",
    "most detectable sources are very near to the sun , a few hundreds parsec at most , and the gould belt contributes significantly to the detectable population .",
    "if these sources are really located in the solar neighbourhood , some of them could be detected in the electromagnetic band through their thermal emission .",
    "the distance `` reached '' by interferometers of the second generation is much larger than that of initial detectors : even sources located in the galactic centre can be detected , for some models , but strongest sources are expected to be near and then distributed rather homogeneously around the sun .",
    "this , and the poor knowledge we have about typical frequencies and spin - down rates of gwdns , are the reason why a _ blind _ search is needed in any case . as it is by",
    "now well known , a _ blind _ search can be performed only using non optimal data analysis methods with reduced sensitivity respect to optimal ones ( typically a factor of 2 - 3 ) but which require a reasonable , although large , amount of computing resources .",
    "more precisely , the larger is the available computing power and the wider can be the search , covering a larger portion of the source parameter space .",
    "this work has shown that gwdns are potentially interesting sources of gravitational radiation . clearly , the very poor knowledge we have about parameter values , in particular the ellipticity , prevents us from giving firm estimations of the expected number of detections . by the way , even for interferometers of the first generation , already taking data or being on the point to start data collection , it is possible , although rather unlikely , that some detection takes place .",
    "possibilities of detection are obviously much better for interferometers of the second generation , which could be able to catch several sources .",
    "indeed , gravitational wave astronomy would be the best tool to study the properties and demography of gwdns .",
    "in the previous sections we have considered gwdns as isolated asymmetric neutron stars with a magnetic field strength low enough so that the gravitational spin - down is dominant respect to the standard dipolar magnetic field spin - down . however , as already anticipated in section 2 , a neutron star can pass through different evolutionary stages in which the spin - down is due to other mechanisms , like those connected to the interaction of the star with the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in this section",
    "we shortly remind the standard classification of isolated neutron stars evolutionary stages and try to understand if mechanisms different from the dipolar field spin - down can overcome the gravitational spin - down in gwdns .    according to the standard classification @xcite",
    ", basically three different evolutionary stages can be outlined for neutron stars . in the _ ejector _",
    "phase the gravitational energy density at the accretion radius is lower than the energy density of the momentum outflow produced by the rotating magnetic field ; neglecting the possible emission of gravitational radiation , the spin - down is due to the rotating dipolar magnetic field .",
    "a neutron star in this phase can appear , but not necessarily , as a pulsar .",
    "this phase , depending on the strength of the field and on the star velocity , can last even for the whole neutron star life .",
    "the _ propeller _ phase starts when the gravitational energy density at the accretion radius is larger than the energy density due to the momentum outflow produced by the rotating magnetic field .",
    "this condition is verified when the rotation period is larger than @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the _ accretion radius_. the accretion rate on a neutron star , in the bondi theory , is @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the particle density in the ism ( @xmath177 ) and @xmath178 is the neutron star velocity .",
    "another characteristic length which we will use in the following is the _ alfvn radius _ @xmath179 in the _ propeller _ phase the neutron star can start to interact with the interstellar medium : matter can fall toward the neutron star up to the _ alfvn radius _ where the magnetic energy density balances the kinetic energy of the falling matter .",
    "the co - rotating magnetosphere will prevent the accretion of matter on the stellar surface , unless the gravitational acceleration at the _ alfvn radius _ is larger than the centrifugal acceleration _ and _ the _ alfvn radius _ is smaller then the accretion radius .",
    "the latter condition implies that the neutron star velocity satisifes the inequality @xmath180 the former condition translates in a second critical period @xmath181 for periods @xmath182 we are in the _ accretor _ phase where the matter can fall up to the stellar surface .",
    "both in the _ propeller _ and in the _ accretor _ phase the neutron star spin - down is not given by eq.([omegadotem ] ) , which holds in the _ ejector _ phase , then the condition to have a gwdns , given by eq.([b ] ) , must change . from eqs.([pcrit1],[dotm ] ) we have that the condition the magnetic field must satisfy in order to bring the neutron star in the _ propeller _ phase is @xmath183 here and in the following equations the neutron star is supposed to have a radius @xmath184 . assuming the neutron star is in the _ propeller _ phase ,",
    "let us see which is the further condition we need on the magnetic field so that the spin - down is still dominated by the emission of gravitational waves . in the _ propeller _",
    "phase the neutron star looses its rotational energy to the ism and spins - down at a rate @xcite @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the _ corotation radius _ , @xmath187 is the local keplerian velocity at @xmath188 and @xmath189 is a numerical factor depending on the geometry of the accretion flow , which for spherical accretion , typical of isolated neutron stars , is @xmath190 . using eq.([omegadotgw ] ) and eq.([omegadotprop ] ) and imposing that @xmath191 we find : @xmath192 for instance , assuming @xmath193 we have @xmath194 and @xmath195 , that is , even if the magnetic field is so low that the neutron star moves to the _ propeller _ phase , the gravitational spin - down is still dominating , unless the magnetic field is nearly vanishing .",
    "this conclusion is even strenghtened if we consider that most neutron stars have typical velocity much larger than @xmath196 and that the accretion rate given by eq.([dotm ] ) is only an upper limit and is probably much lower in real situations . from eqs.([pcrit2],[dotm ] ) we obtain also the condition on the magnetic field in order to enter in the _ accretor _ phase : @xmath197 if this condition is satisfied , eq.([vcrit ] ) , which must be also satisfied to be in the _ accretor _ regime , gives @xmath198 , and then is also verified .",
    "now we compare the spin - down rate of a neutron star in the _ accretor _ stage with that due to gravitational radiation .",
    "the spin - down rate in the accretor stage can be written as @xcite @xmath199 where the first term in the righ - hand side describes the braking moment of the forces due to the possible turbulization of the ism , @xmath200 is a dimensionless costant with value @xmath201 and @xmath202 is a random term which superimposes to the first one and can produce , on small time scales , both spin - down and spin - up of the neutron star . imposing that @xmath203 we find our last condition on the magnetic field strength in order to have a neutron star dominated by the emission of gravitational waves : @xmath204 if eq.([bcritacc ] ) is verified also eq.([bcrit2acc ] )",
    "is satisfied , at least if we limit ourselves to consider the frequency range where detectable ( in principle ) sources can be placed , that is @xmath205 . as a conclusion , we can say that , unless the magnetic field is nearly vanishing , a neutron star which is not in the _ ejector _ phase will be dominated by the emission of gravitational radiation .",
