    "a number of nearby galaxies host bright off - center point - like x - ray sources , with luminosities of @xmath17  @xmath18 erg s@xmath2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these x - ray sources are usually called ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ; @xcite ) . based on their high luminosities ,",
    "ulxs are regarded as candidates for intermediate - mass black holes with masses of @xmath19  @xmath20 .",
    "x - ray spectra of ulxs are usually described by a multi - color disk ( mcd ; @xcite ) model , or a power - law ( pl ) model . because the mcd model provides a good approximation for the x - ray emission from a standard accretion disk @xcite and successfully interprets the observed x - ray spectra of galactic black hole candidates , the black hole scenario for ulxs seems plausible . however",
    ", a simple application of the mcd model to ulxs gives an innermost disk temperature ( @xmath21  @xmath9 kev , @xcite ) significantly higher than those of galactic black holes ( @xmath22  @xmath23 kev ) .",
    "this is apparently inconsistent with the argument for a intermediate - mass black hole , since a more massive object would have a lower disk temperature as @xmath24 .",
    "according to recent studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the high temperature of ulxs can be explained if they harbor `` slim disks '' @xcite , in which an advection - dominated accretion flow and/or photon trapping ( e.g. , @xcite ) become important , due to a high accretion rate .    among accreting galactic black holes that are accompanied by standard accretion disks , some objects exhibit rather high temperatures , such as gro j1655 - 40 and grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "@xcite proposed a spinning ( i.e. , kerr ) black hole scenario , for such objects ; the last stable orbit of a prograde accretion disk around a kerr black hole can get closer to the black hole . accordingly",
    "@xmath25 can potentially be higher , compared to that of a non - rotating black hole , although various relativistic effects should be taken into account .",
    "the kerr black hole scenario was subsequently applied to ulxs by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , recent x - ray observations , including those with suzaku in particular , have revealed evidence of black hole rotation in the seyfert i galaxy mcg@xmath266@xmath2630@xmath2615 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ngc 4945 is a nearby spiral galaxy with an edge - on configuration ( @xmath27 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is regarded as a member galaxy of the centaurus cluster , and its distance is precisely estimated to be @xmath4 mpc @xcite .",
    "this galaxy hosts a seyfert ii nucleus which is one of the brightest known active galactic nuclei in the universe above 20 kev @xcite .",
    "while the nucleus is directly invisible due to heavy obscuration below 10 kev @xcite , several bright x - ray point sources are detected within the galaxy @xcite , some of which are classified as ulxs @xcite .",
    "we observed ngc 4945 twice with suzaku @xcite separated by 5 months , and detected a bright transient ulx in its south - west arm region , during the second observation in january 2006 .",
    "the observed spectral behaviour of the source indicates that it harbors a standard accretion disk rather than a slim disk , but simply invoking a schwarzschild black hole leads to an implausible conclusion that a standard disk is shining at a significantly super - eddington luminosity .",
    "therefore , we have adopted the spinning black hole scenario , and have confirmed that the observed properties can be consistently explained as sub - eddington emission from a rapidly rotating black hole , with a mass of @xmath15  @xmath16 @xmath28 .",
    "the present observation of ngc 4945 with the fifth japanese x - ray observatory suzaku @xcite were performed twice , during the scientific working group ( swg ) phase ; the first was conducted on 2005 august 22  23 for about @xmath29 ks , and the second one on 2006 january 15  17 for about @xmath30 ks . the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) onboard suzaku were operated in the normal clocking mode with no window option and in the normal mode , respectively .",
    "the nucleus of ngc 4945 was placed at the xis - nominal and hxd - nominal positions @xcite in the first and second observations , respectively .    in the present paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the xis data ; the hxd data on the nucleus are presented separately by @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the data with revision 0.7 processing ( an internal release for the swg ; @xcite ) , with the headas 6.0.6 software package .",
    "following standard data processing , we filtered the data by adopting the criteria that the spacecraft is outside the south atlantic anomaly , the geometric cut off rigidity is higher than @xmath31 gv , the source elevation above the rim of bright and night earth is higher than @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively , and the xis data are free from telemetry saturation . as a result ,",
    "about 23 and 80 ksec of good exposures have remained from the first and the second observations , respectively . in the scientific analysis below , we utilize only the events with a grade of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 or 6 . because we noticed some systematic uncertainties in the position determination in these observations , we corrected the suzaku attitude solution , utilizing the archival xmm - newton data ( obsid : 0204870101 ) . by referring to the positions of x - ray sources detected with xmm - newton ( crosses in figure [ fig : image ] ) in a region outside ngc 4945 , but within the xis field of view , we shifted the coordinates of the xis data by about @xmath34 and @xmath35 , for the first and second observations , respectively .",
    "these angular offsets are within nominal attitude tolerance of the revision 0.7 of suzaku data ( about @xmath36 ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : image ] shows 0.5  10 kev x - ray images of ngc 4945 , obtained with the xis in the two observations .",
    "only data from the three front - illuminated ( fi ) ccd sensors ( xis0 , 2 , and 3 ; @xcite ) are summed up .",
    "an infra - red ( ir ) image of ngc 4945 @xcite is superposed with contours in both observations .",
    "in addition to some point sources , we detected diffuse x - ray emission , elongated along the ir image of the galaxy .",
    "the x - ray peak of ngc 4945 coincides with the nucleus of ngc 4945 , within @xmath37 .",
    "although the two suzaku images are similar , a clear difference is a bright transient x - ray source which has emerged in the second observation in the south - west arm of ngc 4945 .",
    "after the attitude correction , the x - ray peak position of the transient source was determined to be @xmath38 in j2000 coordinates , with an accuracy of about .",
    "the source is found to have no counterpart among the xmm - newton sources shown in figure [ fig : image ] ( crosses ) , of or recent x - ray catalogs @xcite . with rosat , @xcite reported the detection of an off - center x - ray transient source , ngc 4945 x-1 .",
    "however , the position of ngc 4945 x-1 , @xmath39 with an error of , is clearly different from that of our suzaku source .",
    "the two transients are thus considered to be distinct .",
    "therefore , we regarded this suzaku source as a new x - ray source , and named it suzaku j1305 - 4931 .    in 2005 february 8 , a supernova , sn 2005aj ,",
    "was optically discovered @xcite in the south - west of ngc 4945 near suzaku j1305 - 4931 .",
    "however sn 2005af , @xmath40 , was outside the xis field of view in both observations .",
    "therefore , suzaku j1305 - 4931 can not be the x - ray counterpart of this supernova , either .",
    "in the following , we assume suzaku j1305 - 4931 to be physically associated with ngc 4945 .",
    "in order to investigate the properties of suzaku j1305 - 4931 , we integrated source and background x - ray signals within circular regions , which are denoted as * src * and * bgd * in the right panel of figure [ fig : image ] , respectively .",
    "both regions have a radius of , or 1.79 kpc in physical size at the distance of 3.7 mpc .",
    "it is difficult to adopt a larger integration circle , because suzaku j1305 - 4931 is detected near the edge of the xis field of view .",
    "the bgd region has the same separation from the ngc 4945 nucleus as the src region .    in analyzing the xis spectra",
    ", we adopted a response matrix function ae_xi[0,2,3]_20060213.rmf for the fi ccd sensors , and ae_xi1_20060213c.rmf for the backside - illuminated ( bi ) sensor ( xis1 ; @xcite ) , all of which are appropriate for the revision 0.7 data .",
    "we discarded the 1.82  1.84 kev region , where the xis response is not yet fully calibrated due to the presence of si - k edge .    due to vignetting effects of the x - ray telescope feeding the xis ,",
    "the effective area for the src region in the second observation is @xmath41 % smaller than that for the xis or hxd nominal position .",
    "in addition , the src region ( in radius ) is significantly smaller then that of typical integration regions for a point source ( e.g. @xmath42 ) , so that the effective area is further reduced .",
    "therefore , we calculated the auxiliary response files for both observations using a monte - carlo simulator * xissimarfgen * @xcite , as of 2006 may 26 ( an internal release for the swg )",
    ". soft x - ray absorption due to the contaminants on the optical blocking filters over the xis ccd cameras @xcite were taken into account in the simulation .",
    "figure 2 shows xis fi lightcurves of suzaku j1305 - 4931 in the soft ( 0.5  2 kev ) and hard ( 2  10 kev ) energy bands , accumulated over the src region .",
    "the background has been subtracted utilizing the bgd region . after summing over the three xis fis , we measured the time - averaged net count rate of the source in the soft and hard bands to be @xmath43 cts s@xmath2 and @xmath44 cts s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the source thus varied by a factor of 2 on a time scale of about half a day in both energy bands , with the hard band exhibiting a larger amplitude .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : ulx_lc ] shows the hardness ratio , simply calculated by dividing the hard band count rate by the soft band one .",
    "it suggests that the hardness of the source changed with its brightness .",
    "we further examine the spectral variation in  [ sec : variability ] .      before analyzing the x - ray spectrum of suzaku j1305 - 4931",
    ", we briefly estimate the contribution from the ngc 4945 galaxy itself to the src region . for this purpose , we extracted the xis spectra from the first observation , and show them in figure [ fig : spec_1st_obs ] .",
    "the data were binned into energy intervals each containing at least 30 events .",
    "we fitted the xis spectra with a two component model , consisting of a soft thermal emission ( a mekal model ; @xcite ) and a pl model .",
    "the former and latter are meant to represent emission from thermal plasmas associated with the galaxy , and the integrated emission from unresolved point sources within the galaxy ( including two faint xmm - newton sources ; figure [ fig : image ] ) , respectively .",
    "both components were subjected to the galactic absorption toward ngc 4945 , with a hydrogen column density of @xmath45 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "as summarised in table [ table : spec_1st_obs ] , we obtained an acceptable fit with reasonable parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : spec_ulx ] shows the xis spectra of suzaku j1305 - 4931 , obtained by accumulating events from the 2006 data over the src region , and then subtracting background spectra from the bgd region .",
    "the fi and bi spectra were binned into energy intervals with at least 100 and 50 events , respectively .",
    "while the x - ray signals are significantly detected in 0.5  10 kev , we discarded the data below 0.75 kev in the spectral fitting , due to a severe contribution by the emission from the host galaxy ( figure [ fig : spec_1st_obs ] ) .",
    "the spectrum appears relatively featureless , without any emission nor absorption lines .",
    "we fitted the spectrum first with a pl model , and then with an mcd model ; both models are widely adopted in studying x - ray spectra of galactic black hole binaries and ulxs . in the fitting , we took into account the x - ray emission from the host galaxy by the best - fit two - component model for the x - ray spectrum of the src region in the first observation ( table [ table : spec_1st_obs ] ) . since we noticed a calibration uncertainty in the flux determination between xis fi and bi , we allowed in the fittings the relative model normalization to deffer between fi and bi . as a result",
    ", xis bi was found to yield a flux lower by about 15 % than xis fi . throughout the present paper ,",
    "we refer to the xis fi flux .",
    "the pl model gave a best - fit photon index of @xmath46 , with a moderate fit goodness ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "however , as shown in the second panel of figure [ fig : spec_ulx ] , the fit residuals ( particularly above 2 kev ) imply that the observed spectra have a somewhat more convex shape than a single power law .",
    "this motivated us to attempt an mcd model fit .",
    "the mcd model gave a slightly better fit ( the third panel of figure [ fig : spec_ulx ] , @xmath48 ) than the pl one , although the mcd model appears to be slightly too convex .",
    "the absorption column density , @xmath49 @xmath1 , is larger by about 30 % , than the galactic value toward ngc 4945 .",
    "the innermost temperature and innermost disk radius were measured to be @xmath8 kev and @xmath50 km , respectively , where @xmath51 with @xmath7 being the inclination of the accretion disk to our line of sight . here",
    ", we converted the apparent radius @xmath52 to the true radius as @xmath53 , by adopting two correction factors ( @xcite for summary ) ; a spectral hardening factor of @xmath54 @xcite , which represents the ratio of the color temperature to the effective temperature , and a correction factor for the inner boundary condition , @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the accretion disk was calculated to be @xmath56 erg s@xmath2 , using the equation @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "this value of @xmath59 classifies suzaku j1305 - 4931   into the ulx category .",
    "figure [ fig : sed_ulx ] shows the spectral energy distribution of suzaku j1305 - 4931 , together with the best - fit mcd model , in the @xmath60 form .",
    "we also fitted the observed spectrum with the mcd + pl model .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : spec_ulx_2comp ] and table [ table : spec_ulx ] , the fit was significantly improved ( @xmath61 ) by this composite model .",
    "the pl component dominates the mcd one above @xmath62 kev , and compensates the spectral curvature more concave than the single mcd model .",
    "the mcd temperature , @xmath63 kev , becomes slightly lower than that of the single mcd fit .",
    "however , the pl component turned out to be rather hard , @xmath64 , compared with the typical value of ulxs with mcd+pl - type x - ray spectra ( @xmath65 ; e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we regard this composite model as physically of little meaning , and do not discuss it in any further . incidentally",
    ", this mcd + pl model fit did not converge to a `` cool '' disk ( e.g. , @xmath66 kev ) disk solution , which was reported by some authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) . likewise ,",
    "based on the suzaku data on ngc 1313 x-1 , @xcite cast a doubt upon the reality of such `` cool '' disks in ulxs .",
    "since figure [ fig : ulx_lc ] suggests the intensity - correlated spectral variation of suzaku j1305 - 4931 , we plotted in figure [ fig : ulx_hardness ] , the hardness ratio against the total ( 0.5  10 kev ) count rate .",
    "the plot shows a clear trend that the spectrum of the source gets harder , as it becomes brighter .",
    "therefore , we divided the total exposure into 4 periods according to the intensity of the source , and investigated in detail the variation of the spectral parameters .",
    "the definition of these periods are indicated with dashed - lines in figure [ fig : ulx_lc ] , and their effective exposures are shown in table [ table : spec_variability ] .",
    "figure [ fig : spec_variability ] shows the xis spectra of these 4 periods .",
    "we fitted them by the mcd model , because it gave a better fit to the time - averaged spectra than the pl model .",
    "the absorbing column density was fixed at the best - fit value from the time - averaged spectra shown in table [ table : spec_ulx ] , @xmath67 @xmath1 .",
    "the model successfully described the four spectra with the best - fit parameters tabulated in table [ table : spec_variability ] .",
    "the source shows the highest temperature as @xmath68 kev ( i.e. the hardest spectrum ) in the brightest period ( period 1 , @xmath69 erg s@xmath2 ) , while the lowest temperature as @xmath70 kev in the faintest period ( period 4 , @xmath71 erg s@xmath2 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the behaviour of the hardness ratio shown in figures [ fig : ulx_lc ] and [ fig : ulx_hardness ] .    throughout the observation ,",
    "the innermost radius of the accretion disk has been found to stay relatively constant at @xmath72 km .",
    "therefore , we re - fitted the spectra of the four periods , by tying @xmath11 together , but allowing @xmath25 to take independent values .",
    "we also adopted a common relative normalization factor between xis fi and bi .",
    "a similar fit goodness has been obtained ( @xmath73 ) , in comparison with a simple sum over the four individual fits ( @xmath74 in total ) ; the other parameters remained unchanged within statistical uncertainties . as a result",
    ", the disk radius has been obtained as @xmath75 km , which agrees , within errors , with that from the time - averaged spectrum .",
    "in the second suzaku observation of the nearby seyfert ii galaxy ngc 4945 , performed on 2006 january 15  17 , we have discovered a new bright transient ulx , suzaku j1305 - 4931 , within the south - west arm region .",
    "we assume the source to be physically associated with ngc 4945 .",
    "the time - averaged xis spectrum of the source was approximated by a pl model with photon index @xmath76 , or somewhat better by an mcd model with @xmath77 kev . adopting the mcd model , the bolometric luminosity of the source was determined to be @xmath78 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "these values lie within the typical range of those of well - studied ulxs ( e.g. @xcite ) . during the observation ,",
    "suzaku j1305 - 4931 varied by a factor of 2 in intensity in a timescale of about a half day .",
    "suzaku j1305 - 4931 was undetectable in the first suzaku observation , conducted in 2005 august 22  23 , and has no counterpart among the available x - ray source catalogs @xcite .",
    "we fitted the xis spectrum from the first observation , by adding an mcd component to the emission from the host galaxy ( figure [ fig : spec_1st_obs ] and table [ table : spec_1st_obs ] ) .",
    "then , the upper limit on the @xmath79  @xmath80 kev source flux was obtained to be @xmath81 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 ( at 90% confidence level ) .",
    "therefore , the source is inferred to have brightened by more than two orders of magnitude in about 5 mounts .",
    "the mcd model fit gives an innermost disk radius of @xmath50 km .",
    "equating @xmath11 to the last stable orbit of a standard accretion disk @xcite around a schwarzschild black hole , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the schwarzschild radius , the mass of the source would become @xmath84 .",
    "however , the eddington limit for this mass is calculated as @xmath85 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the source would be concluded to be shining at the eddington ratio of @xmath86 .",
    "thus , the source appears to show the `` super - eddington '' problem .",
    "the `` super - eddington '' problem is commonly found among ulxs showing an mcd type x - ray spectrum .",
    "usually , the problem is solved by invoking the slim disk model ( e.g , @xcite ) , which is thought to be realized at a high accretion rate @xcite . in a slim disk , an advection - dominated accretion flow , and/or photon trapping ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "become important . as a result",
    ", the x - rays are expected to be radiated from inside the last stable orbit of the accretion disk as well , and the local temperature profile is predicted to become flatter than the standard disk @xcite .    in order to examine the present data for the possible presence of a slim disk , we analyzed the time - averaged xis spectrum with an accretion disk model , in which the local disk temperature is proportional to @xmath87 with @xmath88 being a positive free parameter , where @xmath89 is a local radius @xcite .",
    "while the mcd model assumes the fixed value of @xmath90 , integrated emission from a slim disk is thought to be approximated by smaller value of @xmath88 , down to @xmath91 @xcite . here",
    ", we denote this model the `` variable-@xmath88 '' disk model .",
    "a good fit was obtained by this model ( the forth panel of figure [ fig : spec_ulx ] ; @xmath92 ) , together with the parameters shown in table [ table : spec_ulx ] .",
    "compared with the mcd fit , the disk temperature became higher , @xmath93 kev , and the disk radius got smaller , @xmath94 km .",
    "we obtained @xmath95 .",
    "this value of @xmath88 is consistent with the fact that the observed x - ray spectrum is slightly more convex than the pl model , but slightly more concave than the mcd one .",
    "all these parameters appear to be reasonable for the slim disk picture .",
    "the observed spectral variation of suzaku j1305 - 4931 , on the other hand , seems to contradict the slim disk interpretation . in figure",
    "[ fig : lbol - kt ] , we plot @xmath59 against @xmath25 of the source , for the 4 individual periods ( see table [ table : spec_variability ] ) . for comparison",
    ", we also compiled those of some well - studied galactic and magellanic black holes , and ulxs @xcite .",
    "the super - eddington problem of suzaku j1305 - 4931 is clearly visualised in the figure , in which the data points for the source are located above the line of @xmath96 .",
    "however , it is important to note that suzaku j1305 - 4931 shows a clear correlation as @xmath10 .",
    "correspondingly , the innermost disk radius stays constant around @xmath75 km , which is consistent with the value of the time - averaged spectrum .",
    "such correlations have been frequently observed in galactic / magellanic black holes ( e.g.,@xcite ) , and is considered to be a signature of a standard accretion disk @xcite . on the other hand , the mcd model fit to the numerically simulated slim disk spectra is reported to give a relation of @xmath97 @xcite , and various ulxs actually follow this relation ( figure [ fig : lbol - kt ] ; @xcite ) .    for a further examination",
    ", we simulated the dependence of the hardness ratio on the 0.5  10 kev count rate for various values of @xmath25 , assuming either @xmath10 or @xmath97 .",
    "we utilized the same response files as used in the spectral fitting , and took into account the contribution of the emission from the host galaxy ( table [ table : spec_1st_obs ] ) .",
    "the model predictions are shown in figure [ fig : ulx_hardness ] , in comparison with the observed data . the standard disk ( @xmath10 ) locus",
    "is found to describe the observed relation between the hardness and count rate with @xmath98 ( only the erros of the hardness ratio are considered ) , which is better than is obtained with the slim disk ( @xmath97 ) one @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , the source variation is described better by the @xmath10 relation than by the @xmath97 dependence .    except for galactic / magellanic sources , a luminous source , ngc 253 x21 @xcite , with a luminosity of @xmath100 erg s@xmath2 ,",
    "is reported to follow a similar @xmath10 spectral behavior . however",
    ", this correlation has not been found so far from ulxs with a luminosity higher than a few @xmath17 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we regard suzaku j1305 - 4931 to be the most luminous black hole that shows the @xmath10 relation , and hence is thought to host a standard accretion disk , although a simple standard disk can not solve the super - eddington problem .",
    "we have to look for some other mechanisms to explain the high luminosity and high temperature of the source .",
    "one of the most important remaining physical parameters is a possible rotation of the black hole .",
    "the rotating black - hole scenario ( i.e. , a kerr black hole ) was originally proposed by @xcite to explain the high disk temperature of the galactic jet source , grs 1915 + 105 and gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "the idea was subsequently applied to the interpretation of the x - ray properties of the ulxs observed with asca @xcite .",
    "rapid black - hole spin is expected to make the last stable orbit of an accretion disk around it come closer to the black hole , down to @xmath101 for the most extreme case . neglecting the general relativistic effects",
    ", the kerr black hole assumption can enlarge the mass estimated by equating @xmath11 to the last stable orbit , by up to 6 times .",
    "simultaneously , the maximum value of @xmath25 at the eddington accretion rate can increase by a factor of @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , the radiation efficiency of a kerr black hole can be significantly higher than that of a schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "therefore , the kerr black hole scenario is thought to give a possible solution to the super eddington problem of suzaku j1305 - 4931 .    in order to quantitatively evaluate the possibility of black hole rotation in suzaku j1305 - 4931",
    ", we adopted the * kerrbb * model in the xspec package @xcite .",
    "the model describes the numerically computed radiation spectrum from a geometrically thin accretion disk around a kerr black hole , and adequately takes into account various general relativistic effects .",
    "it is intended to extend the * grad * model in xspec @xcite , which represents the general relativistic accretion disk around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "@xcite applied this model to three galactic sources , for which the mass and disk inclination are already known ; gro j1655 - 40 , 4u 1543 - 47 , and xte j1550 - 564 .",
    "they concluded that gro j1655 - 40 and 4u 1543 - 47 have a high black - hole spin , while xte j1550 - 564 hosts a schwarzschild black hole ; the results on gro j1655 - 40 is consistent with a speculation by @xcite based on its comparison with lmc x-3 .",
    "therefore , the kerrbb model is quite suitable for our purpose .",
    "we re - analysed the time - averaged spectrum of suzaku j1305 - 4931  with kerrbb . among the nine physical parameters in the model",
    ", we switched off the effects of limb - darkening , self - irradiation and torque at the inner boundary of the accretion disk , since these are relatively unimportant for our purpose @xcite .",
    "we again adopted a spectral hardening factor of @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "then , the emergent spectrum should be determined by specifying the mass @xmath104 , mass accretion rate @xmath105 , disk inclination @xmath7 , and spin parameter @xmath106 , where @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 are the light speed , the gravitational constant , and angular momentum of the black hole , respectively .",
    "however , the observations can provide basically only two constraints , namely the flux and color temperature ( except detailed spectral shapes ) . as a result ,",
    "the kerrbb solutions are degenerate , so that we need to specify both @xmath110 and @xmath7 to estimate @xmath104 and @xmath105 from the data .",
    "thus , we calculated the best - fit values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , for some representative values of @xmath7 and @xmath111 . when we increase @xmath110 with @xmath7 fixed , the emergent flux and color temperature both increases , because the last stable orbit gets closer to the black hole .",
    "then , the model tries to reduce the color temperature by increasing @xmath104 , while reducing the flux by lowering @xmath105 .",
    "this @xmath110-dependence become more enhanced toward higher inclination , because the longitudinal doppler effects of the disk rotation get stronger .",
    "here , we only considered the case of @xmath112 ( i.e. , a prograding accretion disk ) and adopted the maximum value of @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "acceptable fits have been obtained for a variety of @xmath7 and @xmath110 ( @xmath114 ) ; the obtained values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 are summarised in figure [ fig : kerrbb ] , where we also plot the mcd model results , in order to illustrate the relativistic effects which are considered in the kerrbb model but not in the mcd approximation .",
    "in the figure , the eddington ratio @xmath115 is indicated with red lines .",
    "we regard that the region below the line of @xmath116 is physically meaningful .",
    "thus , the observed x - ray spectrum of suzaku j1305 - 4931  can be interpreted as a black hole with @xmath117 and @xmath118 @xmath119 , radiating at @xmath120 .",
    "especially , a combination of @xmath121 and @xmath122 gives the most successful description of the observed spectrum ( @xmath123 ) , yielding @xmath124 and @xmath125 g s@xmath2 .",
    "the fit residuals for these parameters are shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : spec_ulx ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a nearly extreme kerr black hole with a mass of @xmath19  @xmath126 is one of the most promising candidates for the nature of suzaku j1305 - 4931 .    among galactic / magellanic black holes ,",
    "grs 1915 + 105 is the only source exhibiting both a comparable high eddington ratio ( @xmath127  @xmath128 , @xcite ) , and a high spin parameter estimated ( @xmath129 , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most prominent characteristics of grs 1915 + 105 . especially in the super - eddington phase ( @xcite ) , is its rapid variability with a timescale from @xmath130 an hour to even down to sub - seconds , presumably due to a disk instability ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although it is interesting to ask whether such a variability is present in suzaku j1305 - 4931 as well , we can only say , due to the limited statistics ( figure [ fig : ulx_lc ] ) , that any short - term intensity variation is less than by 10 % and 15 % , on representative time scale of @xmath23 hour and @xmath80 minutes , respectively .",
    "we are grateful to all the members of the suzaku team , for the successful operation and calibration .",
    "we also thank prof .",
    "r. narayan for kindly giving us information on the kerrbb model .",
    "the constructive comments from the anonymous referee greatly helped us to improve the quality of the paper .",
    "n. i. is supported by the special postdoctoral researchers program in riken .",
    "g. is a fellow of the japan society for promotion of science ( jsps ) .",
    "we have made extensive use of the nasa / ipac extra galactic database ( ned ; the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , the national aeronautics and space administration ) .",

    "<S> this paper reports the discovery of a bright x - ray transient source , suzaku j1305 - 4913 , in the south - west arm of the nearby seyfert ii galaxy ngc 4945 . </S>",
    "<S> it was detected at a 0.5  10 kev flux of @xmath0 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 during the suzaku observation conducted on 2006 january 15  17 , but was undetectable in a shorter observation on 2005 august 22 23 , with an upper limit of @xmath3 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 ( 90% confidence level ) . at a distance of @xmath4 mpc , </S>",
    "<S> the bolometric luminosity of the source becomes @xmath5 erg s@xmath2 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the disk inclination . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the source is classified into so - called ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the time - averaged x - ray spectrum of the source is described by a multi - color disk model , with the innermost accretion disk temperature of @xmath8 kev . during the 2006 january observation , </S>",
    "<S> it varied by a factor of @xmath9 in intensity , following a clear correlation of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> it is inferred that the innermost disk radius @xmath11 stayed constant at @xmath12 km , suggesting the presence of a standard accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> relating @xmath11 with the last stable orbit around a non - rotating black hole yields a rather low black hole mass , @xmath13 solar masses , which would imply that the source is shining at a luminosity of @xmath14 times the eddington limit . </S>",
    "<S> these results can be better interpreted by invoking sub - eddington emission from a rapidly spinning black hole with a mass of @xmath15  </S>",
