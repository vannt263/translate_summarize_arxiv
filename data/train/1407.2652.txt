    "observations of protoplanetary disks  the birthplace of planets  provide a window into the processes by which planets form . while the dust component of protoplanetary disks has historically been easier to observe , the gas component contains the bulk of the disk mass , and encodes much of the important disk physics and chemistry . therefore , obtaining observations of the disk gas remains an important goal , in spite of its challenges . to date , the majority of molecular gas detections in disks has come from infrared ( ir ) observations , where the heated disk atmospheres in the inner parts of disks ( typically within @xmath55 au ) produce emission from rovibrational or high - energy pure rotational molecular transitions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "considerably fewer observations have been obtained of disk gas from the outer parts of disks , especially observations of the lowest - energy pure rotational transitions at millimeter wavelengths , as the sensitivity of current instruments allowed for the high - resolution study of only the brightest protoplanetary disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet it is the combination of observations across a wide range of wavelengths , probing a wide range of disk radii , that will enable a more complete understanding of disks .",
    "this situation is about to change dramatically , as the superior sensitivity and image quality provided by the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) is enabling extensive observations of disk gas at millimeter wavelengths . in particular",
    ", alma observations will allow for detailed studies of its motion and distribution .",
    "indeed , alma observations have already revealed gaseous flows across a disk cavity @xcite , spirals @xcite and a warped velocity field , consistent with fast radial inflow @xcite , in the transitional disk hd 142527 , as well as an inner clearing in the transitional disk ophiuchus irs 48 @xcite .",
    "alma will also allow for the study of winds and outflows from disks , probing more tenuous and smaller - scale regions than ever before ; a helical disk wind has already been detected around the hd 163296 gas disk @xcite .",
    "the work presented here was inspired by an observational puzzle derived from ir observations .",
    "for all moderate or high inclination disks , the keplerian motion of the gas molecules is expected to produce double - peaked emission line profiles for the rovibrational lines produced within a few au of the central star . surprisingly , however , observations have revealed that co rovibrational emission lines from some moderate - inclination disks are strongly single - peaked ( as defined by the so - called line profile parameter ; @xcite ) .",
    "as they also have a small spatial extent , these emission lines are inconsistent with any keplerian disk models .",
    "furthermore , spectro - astrometry reveals that the lines can not be explained solely as emission from an azimuthally - symmetric keplerian disk @xcite . as a group",
    ", the disks with strongly single - peaked emission lines also tend to have high rovibrational co line / continuum ratios , and signatures of high accretion rates ( @xcite ) , including high uv fluxes @xcite and high optical and ir veiling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , several disks with single - peaked emission lines are known to have jets or outflows @xcite .",
    "strongly single - peaked profiles are seen in perhaps @xmath530% of co rovibrational line - emitting disks ( @xcite ) , but recent results suggest that nearly all protoplanetary disks produce emission lines that are more single - peaked than expected for a keplerian disk , and that they tend to have a slight blue asymmetry @xcite . therefore , whatever phenomenon explains these observations may be widespread .",
    "a possible explanation for these surprising observations was suggested by @xcite , who showed that disk + disk wind models could reproduce the observed lineshapes , spectro - astrometric line profiles and small spatial extent .",
    "while the models used by @xcite were originally derived from magneto - hydrodynamic wind simulations @xcite , they were largely parameterized , and only loosely constrained by the available data . yet",
    ", if the disk wind models used by @xcite are correct , disks may be losing mass at a rate of @xmath5 1% of their mass accretion rate , and the results of @xcite suggest that disk winds may in fact be universal .",
    "how might these winds affect disk evolution , or the formation of planets ? the answers to these questions are essentially unknown , and require that we gain a better understanding of the properties and driving mechanisms of these winds .",
    "if the disk wind cools quickly as it extends outwards , and its density drops , a low - critical - density , low - excitation tracer like @xmath1co @xmath6 may be a good choice for detecting a wind on larger scales , and for studying its structure and kinematics .    in this work ,",
    "we present alma observations of co @xmath6 from a prototypical source displaying evidence for a possible disk wind .",
    "the target of our study  the t tauri star as 205 n  shows strongly centrally peaked ir molecular emission lines with high line / continuum ratios @xcite , a high and possibly highly variable accretion rate @xcite , and some evidence for an outflow @xcite . as",
    "205 n is also the northern and more massive component of a @xmath7 ( projected separation ) binary system , in which the secondary star ( as 205 s ) is itself a double - lined spectroscopic binary @xcite . as 205",

    "then , in section [ sec : origin ] we discuss possible explanations for these features , including an extensive discussion of their possible connection to the disk winds proposed to explain as 205 n s unusual ir spectroscopic features .",
    "finally , we include a brief disussion of implications ( section [ sec : discussion ] ) and conclusions ( section [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",

    "short - term phase variations were corrected using the on - board water vapor radiometers .",
    "fifteen 12-meter antennas were available for both sets of observations , although one to two antennas were flagged at any given time during the observations . on 27 mar , the minimum and maximum baselines were 43 and 402 meters ( corresponding to minimum and maximum spatial scales of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , 88 and 500 au at 125 pc ) , respectively , and on 04 may , they were 21 and 402 meters ( with a maximum spatial scale of @xmath11 au ) .",
    "the total on - source integration time for each set of observations was 15.8 minutes , for a total integration time of 31.6 minutes .",
    "observations were obtained in four spectral windows of width 117 mhz , with a channel width of 30.5 khz ( 0.04 km s@xmath12 ) , corresponding to a spectral resolution of 61 khz ( 0.08 km s@xmath12 ) .",
    "three of the spectral windows were centered at the frequencies of @xmath2co @xmath13 ( 220.399 ghz ) , @xmath1co @xmath13 ( 230.538 ghz ) and c@xmath3o @xmath13 ( 219.56 ghz ) .",
    "the fourth window was centered on an undetected ch@xmath14oh transition ( 232.415 ghz ) , and was used for continuum measurement .",
    "the data were reduced according to a standard procedure , using the common astronomy software applications package ( casa ; @xcite ) .",
    "reduction steps included passband calibration , correction for atmospheric variations , and absolute flux calibration .",
    "absolute flux was calibrated using observations and models of titan .",
    "the calibrated measurement sets were then combined for the two dates .",
    "the continuum window was binned to a single channel , then cleaned using the clark algorithm and briggs weighting with a robustness parameter of 0.5 .",
    "the spectral windows were first continuum - subtracted , then binned to a channel spacing equal to the spectral resolution ( 0.08 km s@xmath12 ) and cleaned in the same manner as the continuum window . continuum subtraction was performed with the casa routine _ uvcontsub _ using a fit to the 232 and 219 ghz windows and either a constant model ( for @xmath1co ) or a linear model ( for @xmath2co and c@xmath3o ) .",
    "inspection of line - free channels suggests continuum - subtraction residuals in the @xmath1co maps of up to @xmath510% near the centers of as 205 n and s ; no significant residuals remain in the @xmath2co and c@xmath3o maps .",
    "in figure [ fig : map_plot ] , we show the observed ( cleaned ) @xmath1co @xmath13 , @xmath2co @xmath13 and c@xmath3o @xmath13 zeroth moment maps , and 1.3 mm continuum images , of the as 205 system .",
    "note the different grayscales and contour intervals for each row .",
    "based on the continuum measurements , the separation of the two disks is @xmath7 , and the position angle of the binary is 214@xmath15 .",
    "previous works have found separations of @xmath16 and position angles between 204@xmath15 and 213@xmath15 @xcite , with no coherent temporal evolution .",

    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 at 80 au , with @xmath58 .",
    "however , in contrast to @xcite who use the similarity solution for surface density , @xmath59 , we use a broken power - law @xmath59 , @xmath60 out to @xmath61 au , and @xmath62 beyond .",
    "we also use a simple grain opacity with 80% small amorphous astronomical silicates and 20% carbon grains .",
    "less information is available in the literature for the southern component , and so for simplicity we utilize many of the same model parameters as for as 205 n. however , we assume @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , values derived by @xcite but with a correction for the fact that the southern source is a spectroscopic binary @xcite . we find a good match to the observed continuum data with a disk mass of @xmath66 .",
    "the co 21 emission is dominated by disk regions with densities well above the critical density for this line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and even the more tenuous winds we are investigating here are predicted to have densities at or above the critical density out to large distances from the star @xcite .",
    "therefore , all models assume local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions .",
    "we assumed a gas to dust ratio of 100 , and used a parameterized gas temperature increase in the disk atmosphere , following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we set @xmath67 above the @xmath68 disk surface .",
    "we also assumed an h@xmath69/co ratio of 5000 @xcite and a co freeze - out temperature of 17 k. for isotopologue abundances , we assumed @xmath1co/@xmath2co@xmath70 and @xmath1co / c@xmath3o@xmath71 .",
    "since our limited information would result in strong model degeneracies were we to try to exactly match the observed data , we simply made small adjustments to the total flux produced by the models to approximately match the data .",

    "none of the conclusions in this work depend on the absolute flux of the models .",
    "we find that an inclination of @xmath515@xmath72 is required to fit the observed @xmath2co velocity field for as 205 n. previous spectro - astrometric results , which also resolved the binary , found a disk inclination of @xmath520@xmath15 .",
    "using the @xmath1co velocity field , we find a disk inclination of 25@xmath73 for as 205 s. these inclinations and error bars are determined via by - eye examination of the channel maps and residuals , and based on a combination of the relative fluxes in the low and high - velocity channels , as well as the shapes of the maps .",
    "we also find that the disk around as 205 s must be significantly smaller than as 205 n , and set @xmath74 au .",
    "we discuss this result in more detail in section [ section : truncation ] .",
    "there is some uncertainty in the literature about the mass of as 205 s. @xcite derive a larger mass than assumed in our nominal model , @xmath75 , along with temperatures for as 205 n and s of 3800 and 4000 k , and a total luminosity of @xmath76 . with this alternative choice of parameters , we find an inclination for as 205 s of @xmath77 .",
    "given the limited resolution of our observations compared to the size of the as 205 s disk , spatial information can not be used to break the degeneracy between stellar mass and inclination .",
    "figure [ fig : channel_plot_13co ] shows that the as 205 n disk model deviates from the @xmath2co data in some respects . in particular , the high velocity emission is slightly over - predicted .",
    "however , decreasing the inclination of the model would produce maps less elongated than the data at low velocities .",
    "a similar discrepancy was noted by @xcite for tw hya , and attributed to a warp in the tw hya disk . in our case",
    ", the discrepancy could instead be related to the other evidence for non - keplerian motions in our dataset , which is discussed in much greater detail throughout this work .",
    "the position angles of the as 205 n and as 205 s disks are observed to be @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively , and are therefore misaligned by nearly 180@xmath15 .",
    "the relative alignments of the disk rotation axes can not be unambiguously determined unless the near and far sides of both disks are known .",
    "the disks are either oriented in the same direction with respect to the plane of the sky , with rotation vectors nearly anti - aligned , or they are oriented in opposite directions with respect to the plane of the sky , with rotation vectors having a misalignment of @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath2co emission from as 205 n shows a distinct ne / sw asymmetry , with ne regions being brighter .",
    "this is especially apparent in the 4.40 km s@xmath12 channel in figure [ fig : channel_plot_13co ] , for example .",
    "if attributed solely to disk emission , this effect is naturally produced if the ne side is the far side of the disk , due to a combination of projection and optical depth effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this orientation is consistent with the spectro - astrometric results of @xcite .",
    "however , this interpretation of the asymmetry is not definitive , as our dataset includes several features that are not well explained by a disk model alone .",
    "it is not possible to determine the near / far - side orientation of the disk around as 205 s with these data .      in this work ,",
    "our disk models assume a broken power - law surface density that declines sharply at some radius @xmath81 . for as 205 n , the data are consistent with @xmath82 au .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig : spatial_profile_combined ] , which shows a normalized spatial profile along a cut in the zeroth moment map of @xmath2co emission .",
    "we have chosen to extract an e - w oriented profile to minimize contamination from the extended emission observed towards the nw of the image , as well as from the southern source .",
    "the fwhm of the observed spatial profile is @xmath83 .",
    "we show that the observed @xmath2co spatial profile is well reproduced by our nominal disk model .",
    "the line emission from as 205 s , however , is more compact . because the zeroth moment @xmath1co map is dominated by emission from as 205 n , we consider in this case a single channel map , shown in figure [ fig : spatial_profile_combined ] , which does not suffer any contamination . in this case",
    ", the fwhm of the emission is only @xmath84 and a model with @xmath61 au does not fit the data .",
    "instead , we find that models with @xmath85 au provide a reasonable fit . in principle , the spatial extent of the image also depends on the disk inclination and position angle ; however , we find the spatial extent of the model to be relatively insensitive to position angle and inclinations in the range of @xmath86 .",
    "this truncation can be compared with expectations from binary disk truncation models .",
    "for example , the parametric fit to truncated disk sizes from @xcite predicts a relative size ratio for the two disks of a binary that depends only on the binary mass ratio ( assuming the disks are close enough to each other to be truncated ) . for this system , with @xmath87 and @xmath88 ,",

    "it is also possible that significant freeze out of co could hide a circumbinary disk from our view .",
    "however , single - dish flux measurements for this source place upper limits on the total mass of the system . as 205 has a single - dish 1.3 mm flux consistent with its interferometric flux ( as discussed in section [ sec : envelope ] ) , and therefore consistent with little or no unseen material",

    "additional single - dish measurements would be helpful to place firmer limits on any possible unseen material in this system .",
    "another possible explanation for our observations is tidal stripping by as  205 s. this explanation has been previously invoked by @xcite to explain the morphological and kinematic signatures in the disk around the t tauri star rw auriga a , which bears some interesting similarities to our observations .",

    ".    tidal effects will be strongest if the encounter is resonant or  quasi - resonant \" @xcite . roughly speaking , as in a forced oscillator model , tidal interactions",
    "are most pronounced when there is frequency matching between the internal modes of the victim ( in this case , the disk around as  205 n ) and the external forcing frequency exerted by the perturber , @xmath156 . in other words , maximum response occurs at the disk radii @xmath157 such that the internal orbital frequency @xmath158 is an integer fraction of @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the pericenter distance , where the resonance condition is given by @xmath161 , and thus the inner lindblad resonance occurs at a radius @xmath162  . ] .",
    "note that the resonance also requires a prograde orbit of the perturber with respect to the victim s spin .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , if the pericenter distance , @xmath160 , is equal to the binary projected separation of @xmath5160 au or larger , low order near - resonance is not achieved for radii inside the primary s disk with our assumed @xmath163 . to achieve low - order resonance , as 205",
    "s would need to be more massive .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : models ] , there is some uncertainty about the mass of as 205 s. with the as  205 s mass estimate derived by @xcite , @xmath164 , resonant forcing would occur at @xmath165  au , just inside the outer radius of the as  205 n disk .",
    "however , even if as 205 s is massive enough to have low - order resonant interactions with the disk of as 205 n , a major drawback of this explanation is that bound pairs are expected to be already devoid of gas at the lowest order resonances that create strong two - armed features , since those resonances would be quickly cleared out after a few subsequent pericenter passages @xcite .",
    "therefore , we would need to be observing as  205 during its first , or nearly first , encounter .",
    "this is unlikely if as 205 is a bound pair , as the orbital period is @xmath5 a few thousand years , while the estimated age of as 205 is @xmath166 years @xcite .",
    "it is also very unlikely that this is a first ( flyby ) encounter between two stars .",
    "@xcite suggest that close stellar encounters may be likely during the @xmath56 myr lifetime of disks around stars in massive young clusters ; with encounter probabilities of 10 - 30% for encounter distances of 60200 au ( assuming a cluster mass of @xmath167 and a size of 0.3 pc ) , one can expect @xmath5100 close stellar encounters throughout the lifetime of the cluster . however , ophiuchus is significantly less massive and dense than this model presumes , with a stellar mass of @xmath168 in the central 2 pc@xmath169 of the @xmath170 oph cloud core @xcite , and , furthermore , as 205 lies in a less dense region at the edge of the ophiuchus cloud @xcite . assuming @xmath171 in 2 pc@xmath169 , and using the equations found in @xcite",
    ", we find encounter probabilities of a few @xmath172 out to 300 au  equivalent to an expected number of collisions of a few @xmath173 .",
    "finally , we must compute not the likelihood of an encounter , but the likelihood of observing an encounter in progress .",
    "if we assume an encounter velocity of 1 km s@xmath12 and an impact parameter of 500 au , the encounter lasts @xmath52000 years  a factor of 500 shorter than the cluster age of at least 1 myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; therefore , the probability of viewing an encounter is 500 times lower than the probability of an encounter occurring .",
    "these factors combined suggest that the probability of observing a flyby encounter with an impact parameter of a few 100 au in this region is @xmath174 .",
    "although lower - order resonances do not appear to explain the features we observe , in the long run , the evolution of circumprimary and circumbinary disks is dominated by higher - order , weaker resonances . as with the lower - order resonances , the resonant forcing and the internal damping of the disk reach a quasi - stationary state , in which the disk size is nearly in equilibrium .",
    "a balance is reached between the viscous and the tidal torques , eventually defining the truncation radius of both circumprimary and circumsecondary disks @xcite . however , one subtlety in the analysis by @xcite is that the equilibrium truncation radius is reached only after a viscous relaxation timescale that depends on the binary eccentricity , the final disk radius , the disk aspect ratio and the disk viscosity .",
    "therefore , for very young systems , transient responses on the disks are still possible during every pericenter passage , especially for very eccentric binaries .",
    "unfortunately , at this point we are not able to pursue this analysis further due to the largely unconstrained orbital properties of this system , and the uncertain mass of as 205 s.      our observations might also be explained by some form of wind .",
    "thermal ( photoevaporative ) winds are unlikely to explain our observations , as the driving radiation for these flows tends to destroy molecules ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) disk winds , which are believed to be ( at least partly ) responsible for the larger - scale bipolar jets and outflows emanating from young stars ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , can produce relatively low - velocity winds with a significant molecular content @xcite .",
    "mhd disk winds have launching velocities that are similar to the sound speed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and , therefore , tracers of the wind launching region can have relatively low velocities .",
    "temperatures in the launch region range from a few 1000 k in the inner disk , down to @xmath110 k in the outer disk , with associated velocities in the range of @xmath513 km s@xmath12 . observed launching velocities will be even lower if the streamlines are not directed towards the observer .",
    "however , poloidal velocities increase with distance along a streamline , reaching velocities as high as @xmath5 a few 100 km s@xmath12 in existing models @xcite , which are much higher than we observe here .",
    "another obstacle for disk wind models may be whether there is sufficient overall gas density to explain the extended emission . in the models of @xcite ,",
    "co densities of @xmath175 result in a theoretical column density of @xmath176 , assuming a column with vertical height 20 au .",
    "this is three orders of magnitude below the observed lower limit to the column density , @xmath177 .",
    "however , if lower terminal velocities are possible , then mass conservation will correspondingly increase the density in the wind , allowing models to match observations .",
    "we consider this in section [ sec : windmodels ] .",
    "the structure observed here is significantly different from the very collimated millimeter ouflows observed around class 0 and class i disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , many of which additionally appear to be tracing shocks on the inner surface of an outflow cavity in a surrounding envelope . however , @xcite imaged a sample of nine class 0 , i and ii young stellar objects in @xmath1co 1 - 0 and noted that the millimeter emission becomes less collimated with evolutionary state .",
    "in fact , the emission we observe bears some resemblance to the structures observed by @xcite near the class ii sources t tau and gk / gi tau .",
    "the size scales of these structure are larger ( up to @xmath178 in length ) , but our observations are only sensitive to structures up to @xmath179 in size .",
    "the velocities of these outflows are also higher than what we observe , typically 25 km s@xmath12 offset from the source velocity . in general , however , millimeter observations of class ii sources with outflows are limited , and even fewer observations have the spatial resolution of our observations , making comparisons difficult .    as 205 n has some spectroscopic evidence for an active outflow .",
    "although to our knowledge no optical jets have yet been imaged from this source , @xcite reported strong , narrow , blueshifted ( @xmath180 km s@xmath12 ) absorption features in na d lines that are consistent with outflowing gas and observed in other sources with known outflows . in addition , @xcite report a high - velocity component in observations of the [ o i ] 6300   line from as 205 n , indicative of an outflow . it is also important to note that our observations were _ motivated _ by the suggestion of @xcite that a disk wind may explain observed single - peaked rovibrational co emission lines , as well as asymmetric spectro - astrometric profiles of these same lines . in the next section , we test whether the model utilized by @xcite can also explain our observations .      a simple parameterization of a disk wind was implemented by @xcite to fit observed rovibrational emission lines , and incorporated into the radiative transfer code radlite @xcite .",
    "we describe this model and our choice of nominal model parameters in detail in the appendix .",
    "we find that the nominal wind model does not produce any appreciable extended emission , beyond that expected for a disk , due to the low predicted densities at distances of 100 s of au from the central star .",
    "however , the model does reproduce some of the other features of our observations .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : channel_plot_12co_43_30_54_large ] , it produces additional flux at higher velocities compared to a disk - only model .",
    "the wind model also produces deviations from a keplerian velocity field , including a curved first moment map , demonstrated in figure [ fig : mom1_comp_map_wind ] .",
    "the curvature in the model is due to two effects . at small radii , the dominant effect of the wind",
    "is that it makes the azimuthal velocities sub - keplerian . at larger radii ,",
    "the poloidal velocities are larger and begin to dominate the differences , causing the far side of the disk ( in this case , towards the northeast ) to be preferentially redshifted and the near side ( towards the southwest ) to be preferentially blueshifted .",
    "there are some similarities between the modeled and observed first moment maps , in that both show a complex `` s''-like shape , although it is clear that the observed moment map is more complex than the modeled map .",
    "a twisted velocity field can also arise from radial inflow , as suggested by @xcite to explain the velocity field of the transitional disk around hd 142527 .",
    "inflow and outflow can only be distinguished if the near and far sides of the disks are identified . in detail , hd 142527 is not an analog to as 205 n ; the fast radial inflow in hd 142527 is proposed to reconcile its high accretion rate and inner clearing , while as 205 n has a full disk with no inner clearing .",
    "in addition , radial inflow alone would not explain the very extended @xmath1co emission we observe . however , some wind models themselves predict that accretion may be dominated by restricted regions of the disk producing fast flows @xcite",
    ". the resultant signature in the velocity field would then depend on the relative contributions of inflowing and outflowing gas to the observed emission , and could vary throughout the disk , creating a complex velocity field .",
    "unfortunately , disk - wide simulations of this process do not yet exist for comparison with observations .",
    "co first moment maps , relative to @xmath112 km s@xmath12 , as well as their difference .",
    "bottom : disk+wind and disk - only models as well as their difference .",
    "all models assume the far side of the disk is located towards the northeast .",
    "[ fig : mom1_comp_map_wind ] ]    although the _ nominal _ wind model does not produce any appreciable extended emission , the density of the wind depends on the assumed mass - loss rate and terminal velocity .",
    "figure [ fig : channel_plot_12co_43_30_54_large ] shows predicted channel maps for an alternative wind model , with a low terminal velocity ( 2 km s@xmath12 ) and high mass - loss rate ( @xmath181 yr@xmath12 ) , which shows appreciable extended emission .",
    "the detailed structure does not obviously match our observations .",
    "it should be noted , however , that dynamical timescales for the binary orbit and the wind are similar , and so as 205 s should cause perturbations to the wind structure . therefore , our observations may be explained by a _",
    "combination _ of disk winds and binary interaction .    in conclusion ,",
    "wind models are in some ways consistent with the observations of as 205 n. in particular , models produce a curved first moment map with some similarities with the observed @xmath1co velocity field . however",
    ", existing wind models do not readily produce significant extended emission .",
    "extended emission instead requires that the models be modified to have lower terminal velocities and/or higher mass - loss rates .",
    "although the geometry of the resulting emission does not precisely match our observations , the detailed features we observe can not be produced by an axisymmetric model .",
    "they could , however , be produced by interactions between the wind and the stellar companion , as 205 s.",
    "these are the highest resolution observations of rotational co emission from as 205 to date . as 205 was observed in @xmath1co @xmath182 by @xcite with a beam size of @xmath183 and in @xmath1co @xmath13 by @xcite with a beam size of @xmath184 . in both cases ,",
    "the beam size was not sufficient even to resolve the binary . since the extended structure we observe is only a few arcsec in size , a resolution of @xmath134 or better",
    "is required .",
    "only a few disks have been observed in molecular lines at a resolution of @xmath134 or better to date , as pre - alma observations were limited to the brightest disks .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to say whether the phenomenon we observe is a common or unusual feature for protoplanetary disks . interestingly",
    ", molecular line imaging at or near this resolution often seems to reveal surprises  for example , an extended co disk around tw hya @xcite , an asymmetric , perhaps tidally - induced `` arm '' near rw aur @xcite and asymmetric spiral arms in the disk of ab aur @xcite .",
    "alma observations of a few disks have already revealed azimuthal asymmetries and non - keplerian flows @xcite , as well as a helical disk wind @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that the resolution and sensitivity afforded by alma will continue to reveal many new small - scale asymmetric structures .",
    "if the extended structure we observe here is a common feature for protoplanetary disks , this could have implications for the interpretation of lower - resolution observations . for low resolution observations ,",
    "the observed co flux could incorrectly be attributed solely to a disk .",
    "although it s difficult to determine the precise contribution to the flux from the wind , the box shown in figure [ fig : map_plot]c contributes 5% of the total observed @xmath1co @xmath13 line flux .",
    "also , if the wind has a different temperature than the disk , interpretation of observations of multiple co isotopologues could incorrectly determine the gas temperatures .",
    "since gas temperatures are in turn used to determine gas masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this could have important consequences for our understanding of the planet - forming capabilities of disks .",
    "if we are actually observing a wind , with some simple assumptions , we can estimate the mass - loss rate . for this calculation",
    ", we use the co observed in the large box in figure [ fig : map_plot]c ( see section [ sec : mass ] ) and multiply by 4 to account for all directions of the wind .",
    "we obtain @xmath185 for an excitation temperature of 30 k , or @xmath186 for 1000 k. the mass - loss rate is @xmath187 where @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the actual velocity and length of the outflow . both @xmath189 and @xmath188 are different from the observed distance and velocity , where @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 is the angle between the outflow and the observer .",
    "thus , @xmath193 .",
    "taking @xmath194 au , @xmath195 km s@xmath12 and assuming @xmath196 ( equal to the best - fit disk inclination ) , we find @xmath197 .",
    "a different assumption about the inclination of the flow can either raise ( for @xmath198 ) or lower ( for @xmath199 ) the mass - loss rate .",
    "the disk + wind models described in section [ sec : windmodels ] also required a rate of @xmath200 to produce significant extended emission .    using observations of co rovibrational lineshapes and spectro - astrometry along with disk+wind radiative transfer models",

    "we have presented here one of the most sensitive and highest resolution mm - wave studies of a nearby t tauri binary system and its accompanying gas disks , a study which was enabled by the newly available alma facility .",
    "it is clear from these observations that as 205 n does not solely consist of a keplerian gas disk , with differences including extended asymmetric @xmath1co emission and a non - keplerian velocity field .",
    "although we have examined here several possible scenarios to explain these observations , no single scenario is able to completely explain these features .",
    "two of the most promising explanations include a low - velocity wind , or tidal stripping by the companion , but potential models will need to be explored further and fine - tuned if they are to match the observations",
    ". it may also be that we are observing wind - driven mass - loss , modified by tidal interactions with the secondary .",
    "future alma observations of disks in close binary systems as well as disks with ir spectroscopic evidence for disk winds , or evidence for larger - scale outflows , will be helpful for distinguishing between the two possible explanations .    aside from the observations presented here , it is known that as 205 n has other somewhat unusual properties compared to typical t tauri disks",

    "<S> in this study , we present high - resolution millimeter observations of the dust and gas disk of the t tauri star as 205 n and its companion , as 205 s , obtained with the atacama large millimeter array . the gas disk around as 205 n , for which infrared emission spectroscopy demonstrates significant deviations from keplerian motion that has been interpreted as evidence for a disk wind @xcite , also displays significant deviations from keplerian disk emission in the observations presented here . </S>",
    "<S> detections near both as 205 n and s are obtained in 1.3@xmath0 mm continuum , @xmath1co 21 , @xmath2co 21 and c@xmath3o 21 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1co emission is extended up to @xmath4 from as 205n , and both @xmath1co and @xmath2co display deviations from keplerian rotation at all angular scales . </S>",
    "<S> two possible explanations for these observations hold up best to close scrutiny  tidal interaction with as 205 s or disk winds ( or a combination of the two ) , and we discuss these possibilities in some detail . </S>"
