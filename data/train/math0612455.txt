    "non commutative analogues  of smooth manifolds to which many tools of geometry such as k - theory and characteristic classes could be applied .",
    "+ one classical way to obtain invariants is through the index theory in the sense of atiyah - singer . given @xmath2 a lie groupoid , it is possible to talk about pseudodifferential calculus on it ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , if one has a @xmath3-pseudodifferential operator @xmath4 , then one can consider two elements associated to it    * a symbol class @xmath5\\in k^0(a^*{\\mathscr{g}})$ ] , * an index @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , the index of a @xmath3-pseudodifferential operator is usually considered as an element of @xmath7 ( in the present work @xmath8 stands for the reduced @xmath1-algebra ) rather than an element of @xmath9 .",
    "the idea is to take the image of @xmath10 through the @xmath11-theory morphism @xmath12 induced by the inclusion @xmath13 .",
    "such an image , noted by @xmath14 , is called `` the analytic index of the lie groupoid @xmath3 '' .",
    "the reason for considering the `` @xmath1-index '' @xmath14 , is that it is a homotopy invariant of the @xmath3-pseudodifferential elliptic operators while the index @xmath10 is not .",
    "even more , the analytic index can be given as a group morphism ( using the connes tangent groupoid for example ) @xmath15 that fits in the following commutative diagram : @xmath16_{symbol } \\ar[rr]^{ind } & & k_0({c^{\\infty}}_c({\\mathscr{g } } ) ) \\ar[dd]^j\\\\ & & \\\\",

    "alain connes gives examples of the non injectivity of ( [ j ] ) and he discusses other reasons why it is not sufficient , in general , to stay with the index at the @xmath17-level . the analytic index @xmath18 is a good invariant , however , extracting numerical invariants from it , with the existent tools , is very difficult .",
    "moreover , roughly speaking , the fact that the morphism in ( [ j ] ) is not injective tells us that in some way we are loosing information .",
    "+ in the present work we propose an intermediate group @xmath19 ( one for each @xmath20 ) and we construct `` analytic index morphism '' @xmath21 that will allow us to obtain more explicit invariants .",
    "let us briefly explain what is this group @xmath22 , why we call @xmath23 an `` analytic index '' , and why we state that it will allow to obtain more explicit invariants .",
    "* the group @xmath22 is simply the group @xmath24 modulo the following homotopy equivalence relation : + given @xmath25 we say that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are homotopic , @xmath28 , if and only if there exists @xmath29))$ ] such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the morphisms in @xmath11-theory induced by the respectives evaluations .",
    "one proves that this gives an equivalence relation and @xmath33 is a group under the natural operation @xmath34_h + [ y]_h=[x+y]_h$ ] .",
    "* we call @xmath23 an `` analytic index '' because it fits in the following commutative diagram : + @xmath16_{symb } \\ar[r]^{ind } & k_0({c^{\\infty}}_c({\\mathscr{g } } ) ) \\ar[d ] & \\\\ & k_{0}^{h , k}({\\mathscr{g } } ) \\ar[d ] & \\\\ k_0(a^*{\\mathscr{g } } ) \\ar[r]_{ind_a } \\ar[ru]^{ind_{a}^{h , k } } & k_0(c_{r}^{*}({\\mathscr{g } } ) ) &   } \\ ] ] * we would like to obtain information from @xmath0theory elements through the `` chern - weil theories '' . in the classical case of spaces ( manifolds , locally compact spaces , etc . )",
    "this is done by a chern character .",
    "now , connes developped in the early 80 s a way to generalize this to more general `` spaces '' . in particular he introduced the cyclic cohomology for general algebras and he defined pairings beetween @xmath0theory elements and cyclic cocycles . there is also the notion of chern character for the non commutative case .",
    "+ now , the cyclic homology theory is only interesting if it is applied to `` smooth '' algebras , typically algebras as @xmath35 ( for @xmath36 a manifold ) or @xmath37 . in our case",
    ", it is possible to pair cyclic cocycles with the index @xmath38 but it is not always possible to extend this action to the @xmath7 . + what we are proposing has the advantages of both indices ( @xmath39 and @xmath18 ) , in one hand it is a well defined group morphism and it defines a homotopy invariant , and on the other hand it is possible to extract numerical invariants using the existent tools .",
    "the article is organized as follows : + in the second section we recall the basic facts about lie groupoids .",
    "we explain very briefly how to define the index @xmath40 . for a complete exposition",
    "see @xcite . in the third section",
    "we explain the  deformation to the normal cone ",
    "construction associated to an injective immersion .",
    "even if this could be considered as classical material we do it in some detail since we will use in the sequel very explicit descriptions .",
    "a particular case of this construction is the tangent groupoid associated to a lie groupoid .",
    "this last example will be fundamental in our construction of the index .",
    "+ in the fourth section we will construct an algebra of functions over the tangent groupoid that satisfy a rapid decay condition at zero and are compactly supported elsewhere .",
    "this algebra is the main point of this work and its @xmath0theory allows us to define the index @xmath23 as a `` deformation '' ( in the same spirit as in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the last section is devoted to the construction of the analytic index .",
    "+ all the results of the present work are part of the author s phd thesis .",
    "complete proofs and details may be found in @xcite and will be published elsewhere .",
    "let us recall what a groupoid is :    a @xmath41 consists of the following data : two sets @xmath3 and @xmath42 , and maps    * @xmath43 called the source and target map respectively , * @xmath44 called the product map + ( where @xmath45 ) , * @xmath46 the unit map and * @xmath47 the inverse map    such that , if we note @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we have    * @xmath51 , @xmath52 when this is possible . * @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 . * @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 . * @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "generally , we denote a groupoid by @xmath2 where the parallel arrows are the source and target maps and the other maps are given .",
    "now , a lie groupoid is a groupoid in which every set and map involved in the last definition is @xmath63 ( possibly with borders ) , and the source and target maps are submersions . for @xmath64 subsets of @xmath42",
    "we use the notation @xmath65 for the subset @xmath66 .",
    "+ all along this paper , @xmath2 is going to be a lie groupoid .",
    "+ we recall how to define an algebra structure in @xmath67 using smooth haar systems .    a @xmath68 over a lie groupoid consists of a family of measures @xmath69 in @xmath70 for each @xmath71 such that ,    * for @xmath72 we have the following compatibility condition : @xmath73 * for each @xmath74 the map + @xmath75 belongs to @xmath76    a lie groupoid always has a smooth haar system .",
    "in fact , if we fix a smooth ( positive ) section of the 1-density bundle associated to the lie algebroid we obtain a smooth haar system in a canonical way .",
    "the advantage of using 1-densities is that the measures are locally equivalent to the lebesgue measure .",
    "we suppose for the rest of tha paper that the smooth haar systems are given by 1-densities ( for complete details see @xcite ) .",
    "we can now define a convolution product on @xmath67 : let @xmath77 , we set    @xmath78    this gives a well defined associative product .",
    "there is a way to avoid haar systems when one works with lie groupoids , using the half densities ( see connes book @xcite ) .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , we are going to consider some elements in the @xmath11-theory group @xmath79 .",
    "we recall how this elements are usually defined ( see @xcite for complete details ) : + first we recall what a @xmath3-pseudodifferentiel operator is :    a @xmath3-@xmath80 @xmath81 is a familiy of pseudodifferential operators @xmath82 acting in @xmath83 such that if @xmath84 and @xmath85 the induced operator , then we have the following compatibility condition @xmath86 there is also a differentiability condition with respect to @xmath26 that can be found in @xcite .",

    "the last data defines a quasi - isomorphism in @xmath92 and then an element in @xmath79 that we call the index @xmath10 .",
