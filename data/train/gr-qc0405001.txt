    "in the past several decades , there has been a dramatic improvement in two technology areas : atomic clocks and lasers for free - space optical communications .",
    "future spacecraft are envisioned as communicating by free - space laser links .",
    "the synergy of technological development in atomic clocks and free - space lasers will lead to unprecedented advancements in high - accuracy space - time navigation  @xcite , digital communications , geolocation  @xcite , surveillance using space - based interferometers  @xcite , coherent distributed - aperture sensing at high frequencies  @xcite , and cryptographic communication systems .",
    "accurate clock synchronization is the backbone of these systems .",
    "consider the dependence of geolocation accuracy on clock synchronization .",
    "consider geosynchronous satellites that receive a signal from an emitter of electromagnetic radiation located on the surface of the earth .",
    "assuming that the signals travel on the line - of - sight , the geometry leads to a maximum signal time difference of arrival between two satellites that is 19.64 ms , see appendix a. the information on the difference of ranges , @xmath0 , between the emitter and each satellite , is contained in the maximum time delay that is equal to 19.64 ms .",
    "if the clocks in two satellites are synchronized only to an accuracy of , say 10 ns , the order of magnitude in the position error of the emitter , @xmath1 , is given by the fraction of the range difference : @xmath2 an improvement in the clock synchronization translates directly into an improvement in position accuracy .",
    "for example , an improvement in clock synchronization by three orders of magnitude will produce a position accuracy on the order of 3 m.    applications such as a space - based interferometer , can have even more stringent requirements on clock synchronization .",
    "for example , a multi - satellite space - based interferometer ( distributed aperture system ) that operates at a wavelength @xmath3 will require accurate determination of relative satellite positions ( nodes of the interferometer ) to better than @xmath4 . for practical purposes ,",
    "say we will need @xmath5 , which translates to a clock synchronization requirement @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the speed of light . as an example of the stringent requirements on time synchronization , consider operating at 22  ghz , which is a frequency of interest to radio astronomers  @xcite . at this frequency",
    ", the position of the satellite nodes must be known accurately to @xmath81.4  mm and time synchronization to 4.5 ps .",
    "see table  [ tab : timeingprecision ] for a range of values corresponding to different frequencies . for operating at optical wavelengths of 500 nm ,",
    "the required position must be known to 50 nm and time must be synchronized to 0.16 fs .",
    "these numbers challenge and exceed the realm of possible time synchronization accuracy that is available today . however , the synergy between accurate clocks and optical free - space communication is expected to continue , so that hardware may soon support such stringent time synchronization requirements .",
    "new time synchronization schemes will then be required .    the emerging field of quantum information and quantum computation  @xcite has potential to produce new ultra - precise clock synchronization protocols .",
    "in fact , several clock synchronization schemes have been proposed based on quantum mechanical concepts  @xcite .",
    "however , most of these schemes have neglected real features of the clock synchronization problem that are essential for real - life applications : _ the clocks to be synchronized are in relative motion , and at varying gravitational potentials_. the fact that clocks are affected by their motion and by the gravitational potential are basic concepts that have their origin in einstein s special and general relativity theory .",
    "the examples of the required accuracy of clock synchronization cited above , together with the magnitudes of relativistic effects on satellites ( see section iv , subsection e ) , show that the required accuracies can only be met by theories that take into account the effect of gravitational potential differences and relative motion .",
    "if synchronization of clocks is to be achieved using quantum information concepts , then certain features , such as relative motion of clocks and effects of gravitational potential , must be incorporated in the quantum information approach to clock synchronization .",
    "this article addresses the theoretical problem of clock synchronizing and syntonization ( making two clocks run at the same rate ) , or correlating time on clocks on satellite platforms that are orbiting earth , or that are near - earth .",
    "however , lorentz transformations between two systems of coordinates in relative motion show that space and time are really interwoven .",
    "the problem of clock synchronization is really part of the more general problem of navigation in space - time  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the global positioning system ( gps ) , a user s receiver determines three spatial coordinates as well as time  @xcite . therefore , in this article we will focus on the complete problem of navigation in space - time from the point of view of curved space - time , such as is invoked in general relativity .",
    "the features that relativity deals with , motion of clocks and effect of gravitational potential , are also features that must also be included in any classical or quantum theory of space - time navigation .",
    "we use the fact that space - time is described by a four dimensional metric , but for the most part we do not explicitly use the field equations of general relativity . in this sense our discussion is not restricted to general relativity .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we compute the difference between elapsed proper time and coordinate time , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the elapsed proper time , and @xmath11 is the elapsed coordinate time , at which the satellite is at perigee . we arbitrarily choose the coordinate time and proper time to be zero when the satellite is at perigee . then , up to an additive constant , the coordinate time , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 appears in the metric in eq .",
    "( [ earthmetriceci ] ) , is equal to the proper time kept by a reference clock on the geoid , such as the master clock at the u.s .",
    "naval observatory in washington , d.c .",
    "for each satellite , table  [ tab : satelliteparameters ] shows the the computed values of the proper time minus coordinate time difference , @xmath9 , from perigee to ( approximate ) perigee , accumulated over one orbital period , as determined by solving the geodesic equations of motion , and evaluating eq .",
    "( [ timediff ] ) .",
    "the periods of the satellites vary widely , so to compare the magnitude of the effects , the last column in table  [ tab : satelliteparameters ] shows the difference @xmath9 integrated over one solar day .",
    "this value is simply taken to be the average of @xmath14 over one satellite period , multiplied by the ratio ( 24 hour)/(satellite period ) .",
    "the calculations in the table  [ tab : satelliteparameters ] are done for a finite value of earth quadrupole @xmath15 , and for @xmath16 .",
    "comparing the time difference @xmath9 for @xmath17 and for finite @xmath15 gives an estimate of the size of the effect of the earth s quadrupole on proper time kept by a satellite clock .",
    "the coupling to the quadrupole terms is larger for lower altitudes ( since the terms proportional to @xmath15 vary as @xmath18 ) and depends on the inclination of the orbit .    for the low - earth - orbit ( leo ) satellite ,",
    "the apogee is at altitude of 1007 km and perigee at 964 km .",
    "the difference between proper time and coordinate time , @xmath19 @xmath20s per day , which means that less proper time @xmath21 ( aboard the satellite ) elapses over one solar day than coordinate time @xmath22 on the geoid .",
    "this is due to the predominant effect of time dilation resulting from the high orbital speed of a leo satellite .",
    "also shown in table  [ tab : satelliteparameters ] is the effect of the non - zero value of the earth s quadrupole moment , @xmath15 .",
    "for the leo satellite , the finite value of @xmath15 has the effect of changing the difference @xmath9 by 197.42 ns .    for high altitude geo satellite ,",
    "the difference between proper time and coordinate time , @xmath9 , is of opposite sign to that of a leo satellite . for a geo satellite , the proper time elapses faster than coordinate time by 46.5818860 @xmath20s per day .",
    "the gravitational shift ( causing proper time to run fast ) dominates the time dilation ( which causes proper time to run slow ) , due to the satellites high altitude and relative slower speed .",
    "also , the geo satellite is less influenced by the finite size of earth s quadrupole moment @xmath15 , which is only 31.7346 ns per day , as compared to 197.42 ns for the leo satellite .",
    "furthermore , for a geo satellite , the contribution to @xmath23 from the @xmath15 quadrupole effect is opposite to that for a leo satellite .        for the ( high - altitude ) gps satellite ,",
    "apogee is at 20365 km altitude and perigee is at 20272 km altitude .",
    "the predominant effect is due to change of gravitational potential , which leads to more elapsed proper time than coordinate time , by 38.6858366 @xmath20s per day .",
    "since the altitude of gps satellites is lower than geo satellites , the increase of proper time is smaller . for gps , the effect of nonzero value of @xmath15 is also similar to the geo satellite , but has the larger value 33.8925 ns , due to the lower altitude which leads to a greater influence of @xmath15    the leo , geo , and gps satellites have nearly circular orbits .",
    "in contrast , the heo satellite has an eccentricity of 0.747194 , and consequently a perigee of 6835 km ( 457 km altitude ) and apogee 47238 km ( 40,860 km altitude ) .",
    "this places the heo satellite both lower and higher than the nearly circular orbit leo satellite during different portions of its orbit .",
    "the altitude of the heo satellite at perigee and apogee is also lower and higher than the gps satellite altitude .",
    "consequently , the heo satellite has proper time running more slowly than coordinate time when it is at low altitude ( like the leo satellite ) and it has proper time running faster than coordinate time when its is at high altitude ( like geo and gps satellites ) .",
    "the net effect for the heo satellite is that 39.0644760 @xmath20s per day more proper time has elapsed than coordinate time .",
    "this size of this net effect is similar to the gps satellite because the heo satellite spends little time at the low altitude portion of its orbit .",
    "the effect of @xmath15 for the heo satellite is 141.777 ns , which is 4 times the same effect for the geo satellite , and 0.7 times this effect for the leo satellite .",
    "the results described above are the integrated value of proper time minus coordinate time , over one complete orbital period .",
    "it is useful to plot the value of proper time minus coordinate time as a function of the fraction of the orbital period covered , @xmath24 , see figure  [ fig : timediffplot ] .",
    "this figure shows that for each satellite , the proper time @xmath25 diverges from the coordinate time @xmath26 , at a different rate , along its orbit .",
    "note that time is scaled to the orbital period along each orbit , so that @xmath27 occurs at the respective period of each orbit . the plot in figure",
    "[ fig : timediffplot ] shows a geometrical comparison , however , it does not permit a comparison of the effect in time .    for some practical purposes ,",
    "it is preferable to look at the proper time minus coordinate time difference , @xmath28 as a function of coordinate time @xmath29 . in this way",
    ", the effects are shown as they would appear in real time , say with respect to the usno master clock .",
    "figure  [ fig : timediffplot2 ] shows @xmath30 vs. @xmath11 for the leo , geo , heo ( molniya ) and gps satellites .        for each satellite , on the scale of this graph , the plots are almost linear functions .",
    "the obvious exception is the heo ( molniya ) orbit satellite , where , due to its high eccentricity , the time difference is highly nonlinear .",
    "actually , even for the leo , geo , and gps satellites , which have nearly circular orbits , the rate of change of @xmath31 with time @xmath22 is non - constant , due to the interaction of the orbital eccentricity , inclination , finite value of @xmath15 , and general relativistic precession effects .",
    "these effects are not visible on this graph , but can be significant , depending on the desired level of time synchronization that is required ( see table [ tab : timeingprecision ] ) and the time interval over which the synchronization must be maintained ( stability ) .",
    "the nonlinear variation of proper time with satellite time can best be seen on a plot of the frequency shift , see the next subsection .",
    "since the rate at which proper time diverges from coordinate time is nearly constant for the leo , geo , and gps satellites , these values could be used to compensate for the drift of proper time away from coordinate time , by applying a  factory offset \" to the satellite clock frequency , as has been done in the gps .",
    "this could even be done after the orbit is established and the compensation could even be changed periodically .",
    "however , inspection of the time synchronization that is required for various applications , see for example table [ tab : timeingprecision ] , shows that for many applications this compensation is not feasible , due to the non - constant rates ( for reasons mentioned above ) , as well as due to other forces ( such as solar pressure and atmospheric drag ) that perturb the satellite orbit and lead to proper time changes that can not be modelled sufficiently accurately .",
    "instead , it is likely that for the most accurate applications of time synchronization , the synchronization will have to be redone periodically , according to the required stability ( accuracy required over given time interval ) .",
    "when a satellite clock is manufactured , it has a certain prescribed hardware clock rate compared to coordinate time , in some system of coordinates .",
    "alternatively , we can say that the clock , or oscillator in the clock , is calibrated to a given frequency @xmath32 when it is compared to a local frequency standard .",
    "the word local here means that during the calibration procedure , the satellite clock is siting at rest with respect to the frequency standard and that these two devices are at the same gravitational potential ( they are co - located and at rest relative to each other ) .",
    "we then refer to the frequency @xmath32 as the proper frequency of the satellite oscillator or clock .",
    "the world line of the satellite ( transmitter ) and observer ( receiver ) are shown schematically . during satellite",
    "proper time @xmath33 , the satellite clock sends @xmath34 uniformly - spaced pulses , which are received during observer proper time @xmath35 .",
    "a typical reception event @xmath36 is connected to an emission event @xmath37 by a null geodesic . ]    when the satellite is launched , its clock is assumed to operate normally .",
    "in fact , if the frequency standard were placed aboard the satellite , and a comparison was made between the satellite clock and the frequency standard , we would expect to obtain @xmath32 for the satellite oscillator frequency , to within the calibration accuracy",
    ". however , if the frequency standard is located on the earth s geoid , and the satellite clock sends out electromagnetic pulses , then the frequency of the pulses observed on the geoid ( with respect to the frequency standard on earth ) will be @xmath38 , which is different than the proper frequency of the satellite clock , @xmath32 .",
    "this frequency shift is due to the relative motion of satellite and receiver ( doppler effect ) and also due to the difference in gravitational potential between satellite and receiver . in what follows ,",
    "we compute this effect .",
    "consider a satellite orbiting earth on world line @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where the functions @xmath41 specify the world line of satellite @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the parameter related to proper time along the world line , @xmath44 . see figure  [ fig : clockworldline ] . now consider an observer on a different world line , @xmath45 .",
    "the satellite broadcasts a periodic electromagnetic signal , and within the geometric optics approximation , we say that these signals travel along null geodesics , so the reception event @xmath36 and transmission event @xmath37 are connected by a null geodesic . in terms of the world function",
    "we have @xmath46 where the coordinates of the events are given by @xmath47    we compute the frequency measured by the observer , in terms of the frequency transmitted by the satellite .",
    "prior to the measurement , the satellite and observer are assumed to have calibrated their equipment , when they were on a common world line ( before launch ) , as discussed above .",
    "we define @xmath48 during a proper time @xmath49 measured by the observer , there are @xmath34 cycles of the radiation received .",
    "these cycles were sent by the satellite during a proper time @xmath50 , as measured by the satellite clock .",
    "assuming that the signal does not pile up anywhere , e.g. , a static space - time , we can say that @xmath51 note that @xmath52 is measured at event @xmath36 and that @xmath53 is measured at event @xmath37 and that these two events are arbitrarily separated ( but connect by a null geodesic ) .",
    "we can then relate the world lines of the observer and satellite by @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are increments along the observer and satellite world lines , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the metric evaluated at events @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",

    "the frequency shift of the geo satellite has an overall positive value of 5.38775@xmath100 , and is dominated by the gravitational potential frequency shift , causing a shift to higher frequency when observed from the ground , see figure  [ fig : freqshift - geo ] .",

    "the net shift is approximately 4.4@xmath10710@xmath108 , and in the actual gps system , it is compensated by the factory offset of -4.4@xmath10710@xmath108 .",
    "in addition to this constant frequency shift , the frequency shift also varies at the period of the gps satellite .",
    "furthermore , plots of frequency shift for all satellites typically have non - zero amplitudes at higher fourier components than the satellite period . as an example , for the gps case , we can fit the function @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are constants , to be fit to the computed function @xmath114 .",

    "even though we have chosen a spherical gravity model for the earth for the frequency shift calculation , higher harmonics are present here because the gps orbit is slightly eccentric . in general , higher harmonics are present in all satellites because the orbit is eccentric and because the earth has a non - spherical gravitational field . in the frequency shift calculation presented here ,",
    "we have neglected the effect of the earth quadrupole moment , however , it can easily be incorporated into the calculation .",
    "location of a source of electromagnetic radiation by using multiple receivers is termed geolocation  @xcite . the source ( called the emitter ) can radiate a continuous wave ( cw ) signal or a pulse . in either case , there are two methods commonly employed to locate the emitter : time difference of arrival ( tdoa ) and frequency difference of arrival ( fdoa ) .",
    "the tdoa technique is based on differences of time of flight of the signal from the emitter to each receiver .",
    "fdoa is based on the doppler effect and the difference of frequencies observed by each receiver .",
    "often the emitter of interest is located on the surface of the earth .",
    "this is a helpful mathematical constraint that reduces the number or receivers needed to locate the emitter . since satellites are often used to receive signals , and they are costly resources , this constraint helps reduce the number of satellites required for geolocation .",
    "electromagnetic waves propagate at an ( almost ) constant velocity in an eci system of coordinates .",
    "however , in this system of coordinates , an emitter that is stationary on the earth s surface , is rotating with respect to the eci coordinates , and hence the constraint that the emitter is on the earth surface is actually a time - dependent constraint ( for an earth model that is not a surface of revolution ) .      in this section",
    ", the world function formalism is used to write the general equations for tdoa geolocation , in an arbitrary system of coordinates , either ecef or eci coordinates . since the world function of space - time is an invariant , the general equations for geolocation are covariant : they are valid in any system of coordinates .",
    "i assume that the emitter is located at a space - time event whose coordinates are @xmath122 , @xmath40 .",
    "similarly , i assume that three satellites , @xmath123 , receive the emitter signal at space - time events with coordinates @xmath124 .",

    "<S> clock synchronization is the backbone of applications such as high - accuracy satellite navigation , geolocation , space - based interferometry , and cryptographic communication systems . </S>",
    "<S> the high accuracy of synchronization needed over satellite - to - ground and satellite - to - satellite distances requires the use of general relativistic concepts . </S>",
    "<S> the role of geometrical optics and antenna phase center approximations are discussed in high accuracy work . </S>",
    "<S> the clock synchronization problem is explored from a general relativistic point of view , with emphasis on the local measurement process and the use of the tetrad formalism as the correct model of relativistic measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the treatment makes use of j. l. synge s world function of space - time as a basic coordinate independent geometric concept . </S>",
    "<S> a metric is used for space - time in the vicinity of the earth , where coordinate time is proper time on the geoid . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of satellite clock syntonization is analyzed by numerically integrating the geodesic equations of motion for low - earth orbit ( leo ) , geosynchronous orbit ( geo ) , and highly elliptical orbit ( heo ) satellites . </S>",
    "<S> proper time minus coordinate time is computed for satellites in these orbital regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency shift as a function of time is computed for a signal observed on the earth s geoid from a leo , geo , and heo satellite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the problem of geolocation in curved space - time is briefly explored using the world function formalism . </S>"
