    "several works have already shown the great importance of the direct solar radiation pressure effects on space debris motion , especially in the case of high area - to - mass ratios @xcite . moreover ,",
    "some authors have pointed out that earth s shadowing effects should not be neglected and that these phenomena could lead to significant short - periodic perturbations ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations @xcite have made it possible to identify the area - to - mass ratio of @xmath0 uncorrelated objects .",
    "the resulting aiub / esa catalogue contains a significant population of objects with area - to - mass ratios larger than @xmath1 m@xmath2/kg and as high as @xmath3 m@xmath2/kg . in this framework , perturbations due to solar radiation pressure , coupled to earth s shadows , become essential .",
    "this paper will focus on the numerical propagation of space debris motion , considering both cylindrical shadow and penumbra transition models .",
    "a second aspect of the space debris dynamics that we decided to take into account in this analysis is their possible long lifetimes .",
    "if it is obvious , for low orbits , that the efficiency of the drag forces cleans the area in few years , it is slightly different for higher orbits , especially geostationary ones , on which the objects can stay for hundreds of years ( see @xcite , @xcite , etc ) . up to now the numerical simulations concerning the debris",
    "have been performed using a wide variety of numerical integrators for short timescales and the choice of a symplectic ( or quasi - symplectic ) integration scheme to compute the orbit of space debris has rarely been done ( see @xcite for an application of a fourth order symplectic integrator of the wisdom - holman type ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is well known that these algorithms enable the use of large time steps , show excellent energy preservation properties on long time scales and are less time - consuming than non - symplectic schemes .",
    "the introduction of earth s shadow in this context is a challenging problem .",
    "indeed , the actual direct solar radiation pressure reaching the satellite has to be computed with a sufficiently smooth function and included directly in the equations of motion in order not to introduce numerical errors in the symplectic scheme .",
    "the idea of the introduction of a continuous shadow function equal to one in direct sunlight and zero otherwise has been first proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this function depends on the angle formed by the geocentric cartesian position of space debris and the dark pole of the earth s terminator .",
    "another approximation of this shadow function has been proposed later on in @xcite .",
    "then , a way of computing shadow boundaries has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "it has to be noted that , with such approximations , only cylindrical shaped earth s shadows could be modeled .",
    "hence , these solutions have been improved further in order to take into account penumbra transitions .",
    "for example , umbra and penumbra cone boundaries have been computed in @xcite .",
    "other detailed studies exist .",
    "for example , penumbra transitions and several physical processes in the atmosphere have been added in @xcite to provide a realistic shadow crossing model .",
    "this theory being really time consuming , an approximate version has been presented in @xcite .",
    "penumbra phenomena induced by the solar radiation pressure from the earth - reflected sunlight have also been studied in @xcite , leading to the conclusion that these effects were much less important than the direct solar radiation pressure .",
    "a further numerical investigation @xcite has also shown that the oblateness of the earth did not bring significant differences , compared to a spherical earth . in light of this ,",
    "the oblateness of the earth has not been included in our shadow models .",
    "eventually , we can find another geometrical model of the penumbra transition in @xcite , where the computation of the degree of occultation of the sun by the earth is performed by means of apparent radii in geocentric cartesian coordinates .    in this paper ,",
    "we present an innovative theory to model both cylindrical and conical shadows ( umbra - penumbra transitions ) crossings .",
    "our model being totally included in the equations of motion of the space debris , this is well adapted to our symplectic integration scheme .",
    "besides , our formulation has the advantage to build a smooth shadow function .",
    "hence , it can also be included in the variational equations whose solutions are required by a variety of chaos indicators .",

    "we also show the difference between the evolution of the orbital elements of a space debris crossing either cylindrical or conical earth s shadows .",

    "this external contribution introduces a time dependence in the hamiltonian , formulated as a quasi periodic function . for simpler models of the solar orbit , limited to three frequencies for example",
    ", we could have introduced three new variables ( linear functions of time ) and associated conjugated momenta ( as it has been done for the rotation of the earth ) .",
    "however it would have considerably increased the number of the differential equations to deal with , and the model would stay approximate .",
    "this is the reason for which we have chosen to work on with a quasi - symplectic formulation in this context .",
    "eventually , our model also includes the direct solar radiation pressure .",
    "three standard physical models are used : the absorption , the reflection and the diffusion .",
    "hence , the force induced by the radiation pressure is obtained by adding together the elementary forces accounting for each effect .",
    "the model assumes that space debris are spherical objects and that there is no radiation from the surface of the earth .",
    "detailed information about the model can be found in @xcite .",
    "it leads to the following potential : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the geocentric cartesian position of the sun , @xmath41 is the radiation pressure for an object located at a distance of 1 au from the sun , @xmath42 is the area - to - mass ratio of the space debris and @xmath43 is equal to the mean distance between the sun and the earth ( i.e. @xmath44 au ) . the construction of this potential is also explained in e.g. @xcite .",

    "it yields excellent energy preservation properties and enables us to use bigger time steps than with any other non - symplectic integration scheme .",
    "as explained in section [ seclaskar ] , the hamiltonian function @xmath56 has to be split into two integrable parts in order to be expressed as the perturbation of an integrable one .",

    "[ figcompnimastep ] , it can be seen that absolute errors are quite small for the eccentricity , inclination , longitude of ascending node and argument of pericenter , no matter which time step is considered .",
    "the situation is slighlty different for the semi - major axis . in this case",
    ", the error is clearly bigger for larger time steps and increases linearly with time .",

    ", we show the evolution of @xmath161 , @xmath131 and @xmath162 during a typical shadow crossing in fig .",
    "[ figcomp ] .",
    "even if the shapes of @xmath131 and @xmath162 are different , both share some common properties .",
    "it can be seen that both shadow functions cross the cylindrical shadow limit at @xmath163 , start to decrease when entering the penumbra cone , are equal to zero in the umbra cone and increase again in the penumbra exit transition . a numerical comparison based on several shadow crossings",
    "is proposed later on .",
    "short - periodic effects of earth s cylindrical shadows on the orbital elements of space debris have already been studied in @xcite .",
    "for example , the evolution of the semi - major axis and eccentricity for space debris disturbed by the solar radiation pressure and an area - to - mass ratio equal to @xmath164 m@xmath2/kg is described in @xcite ( fig .",
    "the same simulation has been performed in fig [ fig5yr ] with our conical shadow model . at first glance ,",
    "it is not possible to detect significant discrepancies .",
    "nevertheless , both shadow models clearly lead to significantly different debris trajectories . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figcomppenum0.5yr ] , the absolute difference between orbital elements obtained with both models is zero before the first shadow season and starts to increase after this period of time . a shadow season appears each time that the sun moves through the orbital plane of motion , leading to a succession of shadow crossings .",
    "more information about such phenomena can be found in @xcite .",
    "the area - to - mass ratio is equal to @xmath165 m@xmath2/kg for this example .",
    "after @xmath166 years , the difference between both trajectories keeps on increasing and reaches high values , especially for the semi - major axis ( see fig .",
    "[ figcomppenum15yr ] , blue curve ) . in light of this , it turns out that cylindrical shadow models are not reliable approximations of conical earth s shadows , especially in the case of space debris with high area - to - mass ratios .",
    "the altitude of space debris trajectory must also be considered , the higher the orbit , the larger the time spent in the penumbra transition .    in fig .",
    "[ figcomppenum15yr ] , the results obtained with both shadow functions @xmath131 and @xmath162 are represented by the red curve . given that @xmath162 can not be used with our symplectic scheme , it has been included in nimastep in order to perform the comparison between both methods .",
    "differences between keplerian elements in this case are clearly smaller than in the previous comparison involving @xmath111 and @xmath131 ( fig .",
    "[ figcomppenum15yr ] , blue curve ) .",
    "moreover , this difference between both conical shadow models does not increase linearly with time . by way of conclusion , debris trajectories obtained with",
    "our symplectic integrator coupled to our smooth shadow function turn out to be consistent with the ones computed by nimastep ( abm10 ) using @xmath162 .",
    "eventually , a last remark is given about the energy conservation in the case of cylindrical and conical shadow models .",
    "the comments about the quasi - symplecticity are , of course , the same for the solar radiation pressure than for the third body contributions .",
    "hence , we are still limited in the computation of the relative variation of the energy .",
    "however , it is shown in fig [ figrelerrorenergysrp ] that the relative error in energy does not increase with time , even on an extremely long time span ( @xmath167 years ) .",
    "let us remark that the energy computed takes into account the contribution of the solar radiation pressure with permanent sunlight .",
    "indeed , the part of the hamiltonian function corresponding to the solar radiation pressure can not be retrieved from the equations of motion @xmath168 , the latter being impossible to integrate analytically .",
    "a close look to the relative error in energy shows small perturbations during each shadow season but it does not result in a long term drift on the energy .",
    "km , the other elements are set equal to zero and the area - to - mass ratio is equal to @xmath169 m@xmath2/kg .",
    "the shadow function @xmath131 is used to model the earth s shadowing effects.,width=340 ]",
    "an efficient symplectic integration scheme has been presented in order to compute space debris motion .",
    "the underlying algorithm has been described and the accuracy of the integrator has been demonstrated by means of numerical comparisons . it has been pointed out that large time steps could be used and that the relative error in energy was not increasing with time , even on huge time spans .",
    "it should also be mentioned that our method is not stuck to one particular order and that it can adapted to the complexity of the perturbations and to the desired precision .",
    "our integration scheme is able to take into account the earth s gravitational potential , luni - solar and planetary gravitational perturbations and solar radiation pressure . in conclusion , it turns out that our algorithm represents a fast and reliable alternative to compute space debris or artificial satellites orbits , especially on long time scales .",
    "we have also described an innovative method to model both cylindrical and conical earth s shadow crossings by means of smooth shadow functions . we have explained why these ones were particulary convenient in the framework of symplectic integration .",
    "it has been shown that the cylindrical model was not a suitable approximation of conical shadows , especially in the case of space debris associated to high area - to - mass ratios .",
    "it has been noticed that one drawback of the computation of the shadow functions during the integration process relies in the obligation to reduce step sizes . even if it can be considered as a limitation",
    ", one has to keep in mind that the order of the integrator can be reduced in order to speed up the calculations .",
    "future work will be devoted to stability studies involving shadowing effects .",
    "such a task will be made easier by the fact that our shadow function derivatives are also smooth , enabling us to compute direclty the solutions of the variational equations .",
    "these relations are necessary to use chaos indicators like the megno @xcite",
    ". hence we will be able to extend the work realized in @xcite by considering earth s shadows .",

    "the authors would like to thank a. rossi for helpful discussions and interactions .",
    "numerical simulations were made on the local computing resources ( cluster iscf ) at the university of namur ( fundp , belgium ) .",
    "in @xcite , the entrance and exit true anomalies from the earth s shadows are found to be the non - spurious solutions of the following function @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the true anomaly , @xmath172 is the _ semi - latus rectum _ and @xmath119 and @xmath173 depend on the geocentric cartesian position of the sun and the inclination and longitude of the ascending node of the debris . as explained in @xcite , relation ( [ shadfuncsingular ] ) corresponds to a quartic polynom in the cosine of the true anomaly .",
    "hence , this function is transformed to standard form to find a new quartic polynom in @xmath171 which is solved in closed form by quadratic radicals ( see descartes rule presented in @xcite ) .",
    "the introduction of equinoctial elements @xmath174 and @xmath175 has been proposed in @xcite to avoid singular orbital elements .",
    "it yields the following function @xmath176 whose solutions are found using the so - called _ resultant method _ ( see @xcite for an application example ) .",
    "the latter lets us solve analytically the problem as a system of two algebraic equations in two variables .",
    "we hereby propose a further improvement in the computation of the solutions of ( [ shadfuncequi ] ) . by defining @xmath177 , ( [ shadfuncequi ] ) can be written as @xmath178 or , equivalently , @xmath179   \\\\    & + & t^3 [ -4\\beta\\xi p^2 + 4h_er_\\oplus^2 - 4h_ek_er_\\oplus^2 ]   \\\\    & + & t^2 [ 4\\xi^2p^2 - 2p^2\\beta^2 - 2p^2 + 4h_e^2r_\\oplus^2 + 2r_\\oplus^2 - 2k_e^2r_\\oplus^2 ] \\\\    & + & t [ 4\\beta\\xi p^2 + 4h_er_\\oplus^2 + 4h_ek_er_\\oplus^2 ] \\\\    & + & [ p^2\\beta^2-p^2+r_\\oplus^2 + 2k_er_\\oplus^2+k_e^2r_\\oplus^2 ] \\\\    & = & 0 \\end{array}\\ ] ]    descartes rule can then be used to find orbital entrance and exit true anomalies .",
    "the advantage of this method is twofold .",
    "first , the use of the tangent function directly indicates the right quadrant for the true anomaly .",
    "then , the _ resultant method _ is not necessary anymore .",

    "it leads to the following simplified expression @xmath184 where the small term @xmath185 has been neglected .",
