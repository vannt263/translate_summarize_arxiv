    "this equation describes the temperature variation of a spherical gas cloud under the mutual attraction of its molecules and subject to the laws of classical thermodynamics .",
    "the polytropic theory of stars essentially follows out of thermodynamic considerations , that deal with the issue of energy transport , through the transfer of material between different levels of the star .",
