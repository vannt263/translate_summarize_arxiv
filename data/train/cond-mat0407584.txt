    "what happens to the current carrying electronic states in a quantum hall sample when the magnetic field is turned off ? according to the prevailing view , at @xmath4 the single particle states of a disordered two - dimensional system are localized and no current can flow at zero temperatures .",
    "@xcite a scenario , how this transition from the quantum hall liquid into the insulator may take place , was suggested by khmelnitskii @xcite and laughlin @xcite 20 years ago . they both proposed that , in the limit @xmath5 , the extended states of the n - th landau level float up in energy , @xmath6 , eventually crossing the fermi level one by one , until the lowest current carrying state gets depopulated . here",
    ", the classical elastic collision time @xmath7 is a function of the disorder strength .    over the years",
    ", many experiments have been carried out to check this prediction , but produced only conflicting results , @xcite and a convergent picture seems to become apparent only recently ( see , e.g. , yasin _ _ et al.__@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in essence , the levitation of the current carrying state s energies has been observed in various samples for very low magnetic fields .",
    "however , some find a saturation of the landau level shift as @xmath8 , for instance in high quality p - gaas samples , @xcite and even direct transitions to the hall insulator from higher ( @xmath9 ) quantum hall plateaus have been reported.@xcite therefore , the ultimate fate of @xmath10 in the limit @xmath8 remains an important and still open question .",
    "the answer to this long lasting problem has become even more pressing through the observation of the apparent metallic behavior found at @xmath4 in experiments on dilute two - dimensional electron and hole systems.@xcite    despite quite some effort made in the past to provide a microscopic theory,@xcite our understanding of the levitation scenario is still limited and mainly comes from numerical studies @xcite that are , however , afflicted by artifacts originating from the applied lattice model , and the difficulty of performing a proper limit @xmath8 .",
    "the aim of our present work is to overcome these shortcomings and to study the levitation of the current carrying states within a continuum model that allows to take the essential limit @xmath8 . within our model , which in a first step is projected onto the lowest landau levels ( lll ) , we do not find an unbounded floating up in energy , but a saturation of the quantum hall extended states levitation that depends on the disorder strength .",
    "the main advantages of our method are the straight forward extension to cases where additional landau levels are taken into account as well as the possible identification of those matrix elements responsible for the levitation because they are known analytically .",
    "we consider non - interacting electrons moving in the @xmath11-@xmath12-plane of a two - dimensional continuum model with a perpendicular magnetic field and quenched disorder . we choose spatially correlated disorder potentials to be generated by a random weighted sum of gaussian shaped potential hills at random sites distributed uniformly over the area of the sample .",
    "this disorder potential can be considered the continuum generalization of the correlated disorder potentials on the lattice used in our previous work @xcite @xmath13 the summation index @xmath14 runs over all scatterers at random positions @xmath15 , the number of which is @xmath16 .",
    "the random variables @xmath15 and @xmath17 are both uncorrelated and uniformly distributed over the area of the system , and over the real interval [ @xmath181,1 ] , respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is the strength of the disorder potential and @xmath20 the concentration of the scatterers .",
    "the disorder potential is locally uniformly distributed , spatially gaussian correlated , @xmath21 $ ] with a correlation length @xmath22 , has a vanishing mean @xmath23 , and a uniform second moment @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the square of the disorder strength @xmath25 is effectively the second moment of the disorder potential .",
    "now we study the hamiltonian @xmath26 of free two - dimensional electrons moving in a homogeneous perpendicular magnetic field @xmath27 given by a vector potential @xmath28 with @xmath29 in the landau gauge . for a system infinite in @xmath12-direction and periodic boundary conditions in @xmath11-direction , @xmath30 possesses the well - known eigen base @xmath31 in terms of the hermite polynomials @xmath32 . here , @xmath33 is the finite system width in the periodic direction , @xmath34 the magnetic length .",
    "the non - negative integer @xmath35 is the landau level index , and @xmath36 with integer @xmath37 represents the momentum in @xmath11-direction . for the following numerical evaluation we have to restrict the momenta @xmath38 to a finite number , @xmath39 $ ] , which effectively restricts the system to a finite area @xmath40 with open boundary conditions in the @xmath12-direction .",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian @xmath41 for the disordered system in the representation of the free hamiltonian s eigen base [ eq .",
    "( [ spaghetti_base ] ) ] , @xmath42 now the projection to a finite set of landau levels is easily achieved by restricting the base and the @xmath35 and @xmath43 sums in the hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ hamiltonian_projected_1 ] ) ] to these landau levels .",
    "because the disorder potential is a random weighted sum over gaussians , we can easily compute the matrix elements of the disorder potential in the approximation that the area where each single gaussian is non - zero is small compared to the area of the sample .",
    "then we can replace the spatial integrations over the finite sample by infinite gaussian integrals .",
    "further , we introduce dimensionless quantities by measuring all energies in units of @xmath44 and all lengths in units of the magnetic length @xmath45",
    ". we will denote those quantities by attaching a hat to their symbols . this way",
    "the hamiltonian only depends on the dimensionless correlation length parameter @xmath46 , the magnetic field only enters the energy and length scales .",
    "it takes the form @xmath47 to study the limit of vanishing magnetic field for a given fixed disorder potential [ eq .",
    "( [ potential_1 ] ) ] , it is equivalent to consider the limit @xmath48 in the dimensionless hamiltonian",
    ". therefore , in some respect it corresponds to a white noise disorder model which does not discern between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "however , the normalization of the disorder potential may be chosen differently from the @xmath51-property often used in studies of the high magnetic field limit .    for the disordered system projected onto the lowest two landau levels we find the following matrix elements for a single scatterer . inside the lowest landau level",
    "we get with the correlation parameter @xmath52 @xmath53 all higher intra and inter landau level interaction matrix elements can be expressed as a polynomial in @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 times the intra - lowest landau level elements . for the inter landau level matrix elements we get @xmath57 and inside the second landau level @xmath58 here , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the spatial coordinates of the particular scatterer .",
    "we write the integer @xmath37 instead of the momenta @xmath61 and restrict them to the range @xmath62\\subset z_1 $ ] , which renders the sample area finite . for a square sample",
    "we have @xmath63 and @xmath64 , thus @xmath65\\subset r_1 $ ] .",
    "the concentration of the scatterers has been chosen in the range @xmath66 , high enough to reach the high concentration limit in the density of states .",
    "for the hamiltonian in the restricted @xmath67-base , the energy eigenvalues were now computed numerically by exact diagonalization for @xmath68 and various correlation length @xmath69 and disorder strength @xmath70 .",
    "the positions of the extended states have been extracted by means of the level statistics method.@xcite",
    "a quantum hall model projected onto the lowest landau level only ( one band model ) still exhibits localization and scaling near the critical states at the band center@xcite .",
    "this behavior was observed also in the presence of spatially correlated disorder potentials.@xcite of course , the one band model neither shows levitation of the critical states nor any movement of the density of states ( dos ) peak position when the magnetic field or the disorder strength is varied .",
    "therefore , we consider in the following the case of a system projected onto the lowest two landau levels .     versus the strength @xmath70 of the disorder potential .",

    "this reduction to a dimensionless @xmath46-parameterized model is exact for an infinite system . by calculating the properties of the dimensionless model for decreasing @xmath46 we can learn about the behavior of the original system for fixed disorder potential and decreasing magnetic field .",
    "let us now consider the limit of vanishing magnetic field . given a fixed disorder potential , as it occurs in most experiments on samples without an additional backgate , this means the limit @xmath48 .",
    "for the width @xmath127 of the disorder broadened lowest landau band , we find from the function @xmath88 at small @xmath46 ( see figure [ plot - alpha ] ) a linear relation @xmath128 . in natural units",
    "this reads @xmath129 , which means that the disorder induced broadening of the landau bands decreases for a given physical disorder potential with vanishing magnetic field @xmath27 , but slower than the landau gap .",
    "hence , the overlap of adjacent landau bands increases for @xmath8 .",
    "this is qualitatively in agreement with previous work.@xcite the levitation of the extended states @xmath130 for small @xmath27 is ruled by the behavior of the function @xmath106 near @xmath131 . since @xmath132 for small @xmath46 , the coefficient @xmath133 for the levitation of the extended states @xmath134 starts as a constant ( see fig .",
    "[ plot_gamma ] ) .",
    "hence , the shift of the extended states energy is confined by the broadening of the landau levels dos , @xmath135 . in experiments , where the second moment of the disorder potential is fixed in natural units ,",
    "the relative broadening @xmath86 diverges for small magnetic field @xmath136 which leads to an infinite shift of the relative energy @xmath137 of the lowest landau band s extended states . as a consequence the critical filling factor , i.e. , the number of electrons divided by the number of flux quanta penetrating the area of the system where the fermi energy coincides with the energy of the extended states , diverges as well for @xmath8 .",
    "however , if we consider the energy shift @xmath138 of these extended states in natural units , the @xmath27-dependence cancels for small @xmath27 and we find with @xmath139 a _ finite _ levitation @xmath140 that only depends on the properties of the disorder potential .",
    "this result clearly conflicts with the levitation scenario proposed by khmelnitskii @xcite and laughlin @xcite which predicts a divergent energy of the extended states for vanishing magnetic field . in order to obtain such a divergency from our model , the function",
    "@xmath107 would have to diverge like @xmath141 , hence @xmath142 , for small @xmath46 . here",
    ", we assumed the scattering time @xmath7 in the khmelnitskii - laughlin expression for the energy level float up to be independent of @xmath27 .",
    "there are , however , attempts to describe the classical low field magnetoresistance in terms of a @xmath27-dependent @xmath7.@xcite    interpreting these results we have to consider several issues . first of all , in the present work we included only the lowest two landau bands . though this is certainly reasonable for small broadening of the landau bands because the strongest influence on the first landau band s extended states comes from the inter - band matrix elements that couple the first to the second landau level .",
    "yet , it is not clear that the influence of the higher levels remains small for stronger overlapping bands . from projected disordered harper models including the lowest two and the lowest three harper bands,@xcite we have some evidence that the addition of the third band reduces the levitation of the first band s extended states .",
    "the dependence on the disorder strength remains quadratic in this case . on the other hand for strong magnetic fields ,",
    "the levitation of the lowest band s extended states in full disordered harper models has shown to be even slower and not quadratic in the disorder strength anymore .",
    "however , for those models the levitation of the extended states could be traced at least across the landau gap , which is far beyond the resolvable range in the continuum model discussed in the present paper .",
    "nevertheless , it remains to be seen , whether the finite levitation result obtained here will persist when taking into account more than the lowest two landau bands .",
    "second , the possible influence of the finite system size .",
    "the elimination of the explicite @xmath27 dependence of the system by the reduction to the @xmath46-parameterized dimensionless model is only exact for an infinite system . for the numerical simulation",
    "we have to limit the hilbert space which is done by restricting the number of landau levels @xmath35 and , particularly , the number of momenta @xmath38 in the representation of the projected hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ hamiltonian_projected_1 ] ) ] .",
    "the limitation of the @xmath38 effectively renders the area of the sample , @xmath40 , finite and the dimensionless model an approximation .",
    "however , the finite size of the sample is expected to affect only large @xmath46 , or large @xmath2 for a given @xmath27 , not the opposite limit @xmath104 which we are discussing here .",
    "note that the effective ( linear ) size of the system scales with @xmath45 .",
    "the other approximation we made with respect to the system size is the restriction of the spatial integration domain over the gaussian scattering potentials in the calculation of the matrix elements .",
    "we approximated the finite integration domain in the numeric simulation by indefinite gaussian integrals .",
    "again this should not affect the limit of short correlation lengths .",
    "in a finite sample the simulation results will depend on the concentration @xmath20 of the scatterers in the random potential [ eq .",
    "( [ potential_1 ] ) ] albeit the local statistical properties of the potential do not . in our calculations",
    "we have chosen increasing @xmath20 for smaller @xmath46 , high enough to reach the high - concentration limit in the density of states . because of the limited available computer power it was not feasible to directly study the anticipated corresponding convergence in the behavior of the critical states with increasing scatterer concentration .",
    "this should be addressed in future work .",
    "third , the behavior has been extrapolated from relatively small but non - zero @xmath69 .",
    "although there is no indication for a discontinuous behavior when @xmath104 , there is no guarantee that we can extrapolate our data that far .",
    "however , the range of computed @xmath69 seems to be comparable with experiments .",
    "for instance , combining atomic force microscopy with selective etching , the image of the topology of interfaces in algaas / gaas quantum well structures was shown to exhibit smoothly varying structures with correlation length in the range 4@xmath143 m to 2@xmath144m.@xcite for the latter value , this leads to approximately @xmath145 when the magnetic flux density is varied between @xmath146 and 1 tesla .",
    "our findings for the disorder broadening of the lowest landau level are in qualitative agreement with results obtained previously by ando and uemura.@xcite the basic difference to our work is the incompatible definition of the disorder potential : our @xmath147 is normalized to a given second moment , whereas ando and uemura normalize their disorder potential to a fixed integral @xmath148 ( @xmath51-property ) .",
    "this leads to an additional factor @xmath46 in the potential strength , @xmath149 . in the limit of small correlation length @xmath48",
    ", we find for the broadening of the lowest landau level a linear @xmath69-dependence , @xmath150 , which directly translates into ando and uemura s independence on the correlation length , @xmath151 . in the opposite limit of large @xmath69",
    ", we find that the broadening of the dos just corresponds to the second moment of the disorder potential , again perfectly in agreement with their results .",
    "for the behavior of the critical states in the limit @xmath8 , not considered by ando and uemura , the alternative normalization of the potential strength may lead to significantly different results . in our case",
    ", we consider it physically correct to extract the @xmath27-dependence of the energy of the critical states from the @xmath69-dependence of the model with a fixed second moment @xmath152 of the disorder potential in natural units .",
    "if we used instead the @xmath69-dependence for a preserved @xmath51-property of the potential , i.e. , @xmath153 as for the potential used by ando and uemura,@xcite we would obtain a singular dependence @xmath154 for @xmath8 which corresponds better to the levitation scenario proposed by khmelnitskii and laughlin .",
    "we investigated a disordered two - dimensional continuum model for the integer quantum hall effect projected onto the lowest two landau levels .",
    "the chosen dimensionless representation enabled us to make statements about the energetic shift of both , the magnetic field and correlations length dependence of the density of states peak and of the extended states .",
    "the results were obtained from a numerical investigation of the model , parameterized by the strength @xmath70 and the correlation length @xmath69 of an effective disorder potential only .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath27 dependence was entirely absorbed into the units of length and energy .",
    "for the two - level continuum model we found qualitatively the same behavior as has been observed for disordered harper models projected onto the lowest two sub - bands.@xcite with increasing disorder strength @xmath70 the landau bands broaden linearly .",
    "we clearly observed floating up in energy of the lowest landau band s extended states while the peak of the density of states moves downwards .",
    "both effects are proportional to the square of the disorder strength .    in the limit @xmath8 , which is difficult to access in numerical studies on lattice models , we find for the projected two - band continuum model that the energy of the extended states only floats up to a finite value that depends on disorder .",

    "our result is in accord with some experimental work .",
    "still , the addition of higher landau levels and the investigation of the relevant matrix elements are clearly needed to settle this issue and to gain a deeper insight into the microscopic origin of the levitation of the extended states and the corresponding quantum hall to insulator transition .",
