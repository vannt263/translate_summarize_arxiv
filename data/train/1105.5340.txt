    "a detailed description regarding the ray - optics theory of the eaton lens can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "we briefly repeat it here for the reader s convenience .    in geometric optics ,",
    "there are two different but equivalent ways to describe the trajectory of a light ray .",
    "the first one is the newtonian euler - lagrange equation @xmath102 where @xmath31 is the refractive index and the parameter @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 .",
    "we can interpret the above equation by using newton s law , @xmath105 , for a mechanical particle with unit mass moving in `` time '' @xmath103 under the influence of potential @xmath106 , with @xmath107 being an arbitrary constant .",
    "the second way is based on hamilton s equation @xmath108 with @xmath109 being the wave vector and @xmath110 being the speed of light in free space .",
    "notice that by treating frequency @xmath111 as the hamiltonian , the above equation resembles the standard form of hamilton s equation .",
    "we can define an angular momentum as @xmath112 which leads to @xmath113 when the refractive - index profile @xmath0 is spherically symmetric .",
    "the above equation suggests that the angular momentum @xmath8 is conserved .",
    "hence , a family of light rays propagating in the @xmath9 plane at the beginning will always stay in the same plane .",
    "this fact implies that a two - dimensional eaton lens with similar refractive - index profile @xmath0 functions identically to the three - dimensional one .    to solve the two - dimensional newtonian euler - lagrange equation , it is convenient to introduce the complex number @xmath114 , and further reformulate the equation as @xmath115 by substituting the refractive index of the eaton lens @xmath116 .",
    "the solution , following equation ( 6.13 ) and ( 6.14 ) of reference @xcite , can be expressed as @xmath117,\\:\\ : d\\xi=2|z|d\\xi',\\ ] ] which describes displaced ellipses rotated by the angle @xmath118 .",
    "consider a two - component mixture composed of inclusions embedded in an otherwise homogeneous matrix , where @xmath78 and @xmath119 are their respective dielectric functions .",
    "the average electric field @xmath120 over one unit area surrounding the point @xmath121 is defined as @xmath122 with @xmath77 being the volume fraction of inclusion .",
    "a similar expression can be obtained for the average polarization @xmath123 we further assume that the following constitutive relations are valid @xmath124 and the average permittivity tensor of the composite medium is defined by @xmath125 combining the above equations we can obtain the effective permittivity @xmath126 .",
    "clearly the resultant @xmath126 depends on the relationship between @xmath127 and @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "we now assume that the inclusion has the shape of a cylinder , and its radius is far smaller than the wavelength so that its optical properties can be well described by the electrostatic equation @xmath129 by matching the boundary conditions we can prove that @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the total potential inside the cylinder when the external electric field @xmath132 is homogeneous .",
    "this relation is further used to obtain the electric field @xcite .",
    "it is finally found that the average permittivity is scalar and can be expressed as @xmath133 consistent with the maxwell - garnett dielectric function .",
    "equivalently we can express the filling fraction as @xmath134    99 c. gomez - reino , m. v. perez , and c. bao , _ gradient - index optics : fundamentals and applications _",

    "<S> in this paper we study two - dimensional inside - out eaton lens theoretically and numerically . with the help of the wkb approximation , we investigate the finite - wavelength effect analytically and demonstrate one necessary condition for perfect imaging by the lens . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we present one example design and test its performance by using full wave maxwell solvers .    </S>",
    "<S> epsf    more than half a century ago , it was proposed that gradient index lenses @xcite , such as the maxwell fish - eye lens @xcite , the luneburg lens @xcite and the eaton lens @xcite , can be free of geometrical aberrations and form perfect images , at least at the geometrical - optics level ( see reference @xcite and @xcite for more details ) . </S>",
    "<S> taking the inside - out eaton lens as an example , its refractive index @xmath0 equals @xmath1 for @xmath2 and 1 otherwise , with @xmath3 being the radius ( see figure 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can analytically prove that light rays emitted from a source at position @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , will be focused exactly at position @xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , like maxwell s fish - eye lens , perfect imaging can be obtained by an inside - out eaton lens , and both the source and the image are inside the optical instruments .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , a renaissance of scientific interests appears in these gradient index lenses @xcite , partially because of the developments of metamaterials @xcite and transformation optics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> metamaterials are manmade media whose effective permittivities and permeabilities are determined by their deeply subwavelength structures as well as their constituent materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , integrating split ring resonators with metallic rods will result in a metamaterial with an effectively negative index of refraction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> transformation optics , on the other hand , is inspired by an intriguing property of maxwell s equations , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , their form is invariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations , assuming the field quantities and the material properties are transformed accordingly @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we design a two - dimensional dielectric inside - out eaton lens consisting of metallic wires in a homogeneous background medium with positive permittivity . </S>",
    "<S> to investigate the effect of the finite wavelength , we employ the wkb approach to solve the wave equations @xcite , and obtain one necessary condition for perfect imaging . </S>",
    "<S> finally we test our design with full wave maxwell solvers .    </S>",
    "<S> the original eaton lens has a spherical geometry and an index of refraction as @xmath7 with @xmath3 being the radius @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since it possesses spherically symmetry , the entire ray trajectory lies in a plane which is orthogonal to a conserved angular momentum @xmath8 @xcite ( see appendix a ) . consequently , we can simplify it to be a two - dimensional cylinder with similar refractive index . </S>",
    "<S> we further assume that the cylinder lies in the @xmath9 plane , as well as the propagation plane of the light ray . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we only consider tm - polarized light where the magnetic - field vector @xmath10 points in the @xmath11 direction . by sacrificing the impedance matching </S>",
    "<S> , we can further assume that the two - dimensional cylinder is purely electrical , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath12 , with its permittivity @xmath13 given by @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> a detailed ray - optics description of the inside - out eaton lens can be found in ref . </S>",

    "<S> it is however always negative when @xmath31 is large enough .    </S>",
    "<S> we employ the wkb approximation , developed by wentzel , kramers and brillouin in 1926 , to analytically solve equation ( [ eq7 ] ) with a modest @xmath31 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we assume that @xmath36 has the form @xmath37 for positive @xmath35 , and @xmath38 can be further expanded in terms of @xmath39 , @xmath40 similar arguments also hold by @xmath41 as well as @xmath42 . by collecting the leading - order terms </S>",

    "<S> the first term on the right hand side corresponds to an out - going wave because its phase increases with distance , while the second term corresponds to an in - coming wave . </S>",
    "<S> similar procedures can be applied to a negative @xmath35 by assuming @xmath47 , and the resultant first - order approximation is given by @xmath48 . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , @xmath49 approaches zero linearly in the vicinity of the turning point @xmath45 . </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath39 is large enough , we can asymptotically match equation ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) around the turning point , and finally achieve @xmath52 . as a direct result , in the region where @xmath35 is positive , we have @xmath53+\\frac{a_{n}}{s(r)^{1/4}}\\exp\\left[-i\\frac{\\pi}{2}-ik_{0}\\int_{r_{n}}^{r}\\sqrt{s(r')}dr'\\right ] , \\label{eq13}\\ ] ] which implies that an out - going wave will be totally reflected around the turning point @xmath45 , accompanied with a phase variation of @xmath54 .    </S>",

    "<S> this relation can be easily obtained by time reversing the source radiation process @xcite . comparing equation ( [ eq21 ] ) with equation ( [ eq20 ] ) , we obtain the following necessary condition for perfect imaging by an inside - out eaton lens : _ @xmath74 must be constant and independent of the mode order @xmath31_. the function @xmath74 </S>",
    "<S> can then be employed to partially evaluate the performance of a lens . </S>",

    "<S> evidently , @xmath57 are almost constant when @xmath75 is close to zero ( the ray - optics region ) , while they vary strongly for a considerable wavelength .    in the following , we present a conceptual design consisting of a vacuum ( background ) and ideal metallic wires ( a realistic device is currently under construction ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , the maxwell - garnett formula is used to approximate the effective permittivity of the composite ( see appendix b ) @xmath76 with @xmath77 being the filling fraction of the wires and @xmath78 being the permittivity of the ideal metal @xcite . since @xmath79 should be equal to the permittivity of the eaton lens , @xmath80 , the filling fraction is then given by @xmath81 notice that the first - order surface mode will be excited when @xmath82 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the designed lens , shown in figure ( 3a ) , consists of 8 layers of metallic wires with different radii . </S>",
    "<S> the above equation is then used to determine the positions as well as the radii of these wires . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness of the @xmath83-th layer @xmath84 is set to be @xmath85 , with @xmath86 and @xmath87 being the inner and outer radius of the layer , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> consequently we have @xmath88 where @xmath89 is assumed to be 0.95 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the following relation @xmath90 is employed to calculate the radius @xmath91 of the wire in the @xmath83-th layer . in the current design , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath92 with @xmath93 being very small , which leads to the wire radii shown in figure ( 3b ) </S>",
    "<S> . evidently , the wire radius increases rapidly with the increasing of @xmath3 , with a minimum of 0.007 and a maximum of 0.06 .    </S>",
    "<S> we employ a finite - element full - wave maxwell solver to verify the above design @xcite , and plot the results with @xmath94 in figure ( 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice that we always set @xmath95 , a value much smaller than the lens size while big enough to ensure the validity of equation ( [ eq22 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , an image is always observed at the location opposite to the source . to evaluate the quality of the image </S>",
    "<S> , we define @xmath96 the ratio of the intensity of the image to that of the source </S>",
    "<S> . the bigger the @xmath97 , the better the lens is . in figure </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) , the source location @xmath64 is gradually increased from 0.2 to 0.5 , with an increment of 0.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding @xmath97 is found to be 0.21 , 0.27 , 0.15 and 0.15 , respectively . along the azimuthal direction </S>",
    "<S> , we observe a few intensity minima , and the total number of these minima depends on the source location @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is very likely induced by the finite wavelength @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> one direct consequence is that different modes radiated from the source have quite different amplitudes , as given by @xmath98 of equation ( [ eq17 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the zeroth - order and third - order modes dominate the radiation when @xmath99 , while the ninth - order mode is the strongest one when @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> we further investigate the influence of the metallic absorption in figure ( 5 ) , by setting @xmath99 and @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> two different @xmath93 , 0.1 and 0.5 , are considered , and the corresponding intensity ratio @xmath97 is found to be 0.11 and 0.06 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , although the image quality is degraded with the increasing of the metallic absorption , the basic function of the eaton lens , _ i.e. _ forming an image , still survives . </S>",
    "<S> we can partially interpret it with the fact that all the higher - order modes , such as @xmath101 , are totally reflected around @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> only the low - order modes can propagate into the lens and hence be absorbed by the metal .    to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied two - dimensional inside - out eaton lenses . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding full wave equation is analytically solved with the help of the wkb approximation . </S>",
    "<S> one necessary condition for perfect imaging is further found , _ i.e _ , @xmath74 must be independent of the mode order @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a general design procedure of the lens , based on effective medium theory , is developed . </S>",
    "<S> we present one example consisting of metal wires with different radii , and further verify the design with a full wave maxwell solver . </S>",
    "<S> its dependence on source location as well as metallic absorption is also investigated .    </S>",
