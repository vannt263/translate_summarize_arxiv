    "results for @xmath0 hadroproduction at large @xmath1 have been available for some time @xcite . at lowest order",
    "the partonic channels involved are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "thus , at nnlo , the leading logs ( ll ) are @xmath18 , the next - to - leading logs ( nll ) are @xmath19 , the next - to - next - to - leading logs ( nnll ) are @xmath15 , and the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading logs ( nnnll ) are @xmath16 .",
    "we can formally resum these soft logarithms to all orders in @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this has been done explicitly for @xmath0 production in ref .",
    "however , for numerical results here we expand the resummed formula to nnlo to avoid using prescriptions for the resummed cross section @xcite .",
    "a unified approach and a master formula for calculating these soft logarithms at nnlo for any process has been presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "it has been applied to @xmath0 production in ref .",
    "we now present our numerical results for large-@xmath1 @xmath0-boson production @xcite at the fermilab tevatron .    the @xmath1 distribution is shown in fig .",
    "1 at tevatron run i , with @xmath20 tev . in the left frame",
    "we show the differential distribution @xmath21 at born ( lowest order ) , nlo , and nnlo , all with scale @xmath22 , while in the right frame we show a plot of the scale dependence at @xmath23 gev . for the nnlo corrections we show both nnll and nnnll results .",
    "the nnll results are complete while in the nnnll results we have included the dominant nnnll terms ( more two - loop calculations are needed for an exact nnnll calculation @xcite ) . throughout",
    "we have used the mrst2002 nnlo parton densities @xcite .",
    "we see that the nnlo corrections are not very large but they significantly diminish the factorization / renormalization scale dependence of the cross section .    in fig .",
    "2 we show similar results for tevatron run ii , with @xmath24 tev . in the left frame",
    "we plot @xmath21 with @xmath22 , while in the right frame we show results at @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "again , the reduction of the scale dependence at nnlo is evident : the two nnlo curves are on top of each other .",
    "finally , we note that similar results have been derived for the related process of direct photon production @xcite .",
