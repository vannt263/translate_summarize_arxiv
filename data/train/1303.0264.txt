    "in the companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) , we have revisited the basic theory of warped astrophysical discs , in which the orbital plane varies with radius .",
    "we have introduced a local model , a warped shearing sheet , that is suitable for detailed analytical and numerical studies of warped discs . as well as rederiving the nonlinear theory of laminar viscous discs",
    "@xcite by a simpler route , we have shown how the local model can be used more generally to compute the internal torque that drives the large - scale evolution of the shape and mass distribution of the disc , thereby connecting the local and global dynamics .",
    "an important feature of a warped disc is that the orbiting fluid experiences a horizontal pressure gradient , antisymmetric about the midplane , that oscillates at the orbital frequency ( or nearly so , if the shape of the disc is slowly varying in a non - rotating frame of reference ) .",
    "this force generates horizontal shearing motions , which are resonantly amplified if the disc is keplerian ( or nearly so ) , owing to the coincidence of the orbital and epicyclic frequencies . by transporting angular momentum in the radial direction",
    ", these motions provide an internal torque that causes an anomalously rapid evolution of the disc .",
    "existing treatments of warped discs represent these internal motions , if at all , as laminar flows . in @xcite their amplitude",
    "is limited only by viscous damping , with the result that the internal torque , and the rate of evolution of the warp , are inversely proportional to the viscosity .",
    "( in this context , viscosity is usually taken to represent the effects of unresolved physical processes such as small - scale turbulence . ) in a propagating bending wave @xcite the time - dependence ensures that the internal motions have a finite amplitude , even in the absence of viscosity , but the linear theory often predicts hypersonic flows above and below the midplane .",
    "the same is true in the nonlinear theory of @xcite , which we have revisited in paper  i.    it has previously been noted that these oscillatory shear flows are likely to be linearly unstable @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , instability has not been detected in any of the global numerical simulations of warped discs ( many of which are cited in paper  i ) , probably because they have insufficient spatial resolution or too much viscosity , either explicit or numerical , to allow the unstable modes to develop .",
    "therefore these simulations also represent warped discs as laminar flows and may be missing an important physical process .",
    "hydrodynamic instability is likely to lead to turbulence , or at least significant wave activity , and to alter the internal flows in a warped disc .",
    "we expect an important modification of the large - scale dynamics of warped discs , and this is one reason why we are motivated to make a detailed study of the instability .",
    "another reason is that it will provide a source of hydrodynamic activity in keplerian discs , especially in poorly ionized regions where the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) is inoperative .",
    "these secondary motions could be important in determining many of the physical properties of these regions , for example by stirring up the dead zones of protoplanetary discs .",
    "note that only a very small warp may be required to excite these motions , owing to the resonant amplification of the internal flows in a keplerian disc .",
    "such small but dynamically significant warps may not be directly observable even with high - resolution imaging .",
    "more generally , we are interested in the interplay between hydrodynamic instability resulting from a warp and other sources of turbulence and transport in astrophysical discs , including the mri .    the likelihood of a local linear hydrodynamic instability in warped discs was noted by @xcite , and the first explicit calculations were made by @xcite .",
    "@xcite did not represent the warp itself , but considered the horizontal shearing motions , oscillating at the local orbital frequency , that are driven by the warp .",
    "these motions are linearly unstable when the associated shear rate is sufficiently large compared to the viscosity of the fluid , the instability taking the form of a parametric resonance of inertial waves . in nonlinear local simulations , the shearing motions decay as they lose energy to inertial waves .",
    "@xcite studied the decay of similar flows in the presence of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence driven by the mri .",
    "an effect related to the parametric instability of warped discs is the mode - coupling process investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this allows a warp in the inner part of a disc around a black hole to excite inertial waves that are trapped near the radius at which the epicyclic frequency is maximal , and which may be related to observed high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations from accreting black holes .    in the local hydrodynamic and mhd simulations of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the horizontal shearing motions were imposed as initial conditions and were allowed to decay through instability or interaction with turbulence . however , in order to reach a better understanding of the role of instabilities or turbulence in the dynamics of warped discs , a model is required in which the effect of the warp can be maintained and the dynamics can reach a quasi - steady state .",
    "such a model is provided by the warped shearing sheet defined in paper  i.    to prepare the way for future nonlinear simulations in the warped shearing sheet , we tackle the linear problem in this paper , analysing the hydrodynamic stability of the laminar flows computed in paper  i. our analysis is closely related to that of @xcite , but is more detailed and is based on the nonlinear laminar flow solutions computed in a warped shearing sheet .",
    "we compute the growth rates of the unstable modes and their variation with several parameters . in certain regimes",
    "the instability can be clearly identified as a parametric resonance of inertial waves , in agreement with previous work .",
    "we also speculate on the nonlinear outcome and its consequences for warped discs , as well as making suggestions for further investigation .",
    "in this section we summarize the equations of paper  i on which our analysis is based .",
    "the local model of a warped disc introduced in that paper is based on a circular reference orbit of radius @xmath0 and angular velocity @xmath1 , where the dimensionless rate of orbital shear is @xmath2 , equal to @xmath3 for keplerian orbits .",
    "the initial construction is identical to the standard shearing sheet or box and leads to the hydrodynamic equations @xmath4",
    "@xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lagrangian derivative and @xmath9 is the velocity . for simplicity",
    ", we consider an isothermal gas for which @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the isothermal sound speed , and we make use of the pseudo - enthalpy @xmath12    to represent a warped disc we introduce the warped shearing coordinates @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the orbital phase and @xmath18 is the dimensionless warp amplitude .",
    "these coordinates follow the warped orbital motion .",
    "partial derivatives transform according to @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 so that @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 are the relative velocity components .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are therefore transformed into @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 . \\label{dh}\\ ] ] these equations are easily extended to include a dynamic shear viscosity @xmath31 and a dynamic bulk viscosity @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constant dimensionless coefficients .",
    "we do not write out the viscous terms explicitly , however .",
    "the simplest solutions of equations ( [ dvx])([dh ] ) , extended to include viscosity , are laminar flows of the form @xmath35",
    "@xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and  @xmath43 are dimensionless @xmath44-periodic functions that satisfy the equations @xmath45 , \\label{du}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath46,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath47,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the ordinary derivative @xmath51 .",
    "numerical solutions of these equations are presented in paper  i.",
    "before embarking on a detailed analysis of the stability of the laminar flows , we make some very simple estimates , omitting factors of order unity .",
    "we are usually interested in discs that are nearly keplerian ( @xmath52 ) and of low viscosity ( @xmath53 ) . in such discs",
    "the horizontal laminar flows are resonant and can reach large amplitudes , even if the warp amplitude @xmath18 is small .    the magnitude of  @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 , which is similar ) can be simply estimated as follows .",
    "the horizontal motion is a linear oscillator , whose natural frequency is the epicyclic frequency .",
    "it is forced at the orbital frequency by the horizontal pressure gradients associated with the warp , and is damped by viscosity .",
    "the problem is similar to a damped harmonic oscillator forced at , or close to , its natural frequency ; the response of the oscillator is limited either by detuning or damping , whichever is larger .",
    "when detuning of the resonance due to non - keplerian rotation is the limiting factor , @xmath39 scales as @xmath54 ( valid when this quantity is @xmath55 ) .",
    "when viscous damping of the horizontal flows is the limiting factor , @xmath39 scales as @xmath56 ( valid when this quantity is @xmath55 ) .",
    "examples of these scalings can be seen in figs  6 and  7 of paper  i.    these oscillatory shear flows are unstable in the absence of viscosity , and the inviscid growth rate of the instability scales with the shear rate @xmath57 @xcite . since the unstable modes have a non - trivial vertical structure and a horizontal wavelength related to the scale - height of the disc , @xmath58 , viscous damping quenches the instability if @xmath59 , i.e.  if @xmath60 .",
    "therefore ( omitting factors of order unity ) instability is expected when @xmath61 or @xmath62 , whichever is larger .",
    "these are only very rough estimates or scaling relations ; detailed results are obtained in section  [ s : numerical_stability ] below .      to examine the stability of the laminar flows we linearize the basic equations ( [ dvx])([dh ] ) about the solution ( [ vx])([h ] ) , introducing infinitesimal perturbations of the form @xmath63,\\ ] ] etc . , where @xmath64 is a real horizontal wavevector",
    "the linearized equations admit solutions of this plane - wave form because the basic equations ( [ dvx])([dh ] ) from which they are derived do not contain @xmath65 or @xmath66 explicitly , and the basic state about which we are linearizing is also independent of  @xmath65 and  @xmath66 . using the relations  ( [ xp ] ) and  ( [ yp ] ) between the primed and unprimed horizontal coordinates ,",
    "we find @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a wavevector that may depend on time . if @xmath69 then @xmath70 depends linearly on @xmath71 and we have a shearing wave , which corresponds to a non - axisymmetric spiral disturbance in the global geometry .",
    "if @xmath72 then @xmath73 is a constant : the wave is axisymmetric and does not shear .",
    "we also adopt units in which @xmath74 and @xmath75 , meaning that the unit of length is the scale - height @xmath76 of an unwarped disc and the unit of time is @xmath77 .",
    "the linearized equations in the absence of viscosity then take the form @xmath78",

    "the coefficients are non - periodic because @xmath70 depends linearly on @xmath71 .",

    "this equation can be used to bound the growth rate of the perturbation , as discussed in appendix  [ s : bound ] .      to solve equations ( [ caldvx])([cald ] ) we use a galerkin spectral method , projecting the equations on to a basis of hermite polynomials @xmath85 as used by @xcite and many other authors : @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 we further define @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",

    "another type of coupling is provided by the terms proportional to @xmath117 in equation  ( [ dhn ] ) .",

    "7.5cm7.5 cm    7.5cm7.5 cm    in situations where the laminar flows have large amplitude ( @xmath150 ) and the viscosity is small ( @xmath53 ) , large growth rates ( @xmath151 ) may be expected . however , in this regime the eigenvalues returned by our numerical method do not converge as the truncation order @xmath118 is increased , and therefore we do not present any such results in this paper . initially the difficulty takes the form of spurious modes , presumably arising from the truncation of the hermite basis , with non - convergent growth rates that can exceed those of the genuine modes .",
    "such unwanted solutions can be excluded by comparing the eigenvalues calculated with different truncation orders .",
    "later , however , the entire spectrum fails to converge .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is probably that the coupling terms proportional to @xmath152 in equations ( [ dun])([dhn ] ) are strong , and indeed the problem is worse for larger values of @xmath70 .",
    "it may be simply that the hermite basis , which is designed for wave modes in an unwarped disc , is incapable of handling the modes of a warped disc with strong laminar flows .",

    "furthermore , it is in this regime that the warp tends to steepen into a ` break ' .",
    "the high - resolution grid - based simulations of have a grid spacing of @xmath175 in the vertical direction and an explicit shear viscosity in the range @xmath176 .",
    "the warps are mostly very small , however .",
    "the most warped disc they simulate is also the most viscous , and the instability is probably absent for that reason .",
    "it should also be borne in mind that global numerical simulations may not have been run for long enough for weak versions of the hydrodynamic instability to develop .",
    "given the inherent limitations of current global simulations , it would make sense to study the nonlinear outcome of the hydrodynamic instability of warped discs with local numerical simulations in the warped shearing box as defined in paper  i. such simulations should be able to determine the more complicated flows that replace the laminar solutions in the unstable regions of the parameter space , and allow a calculation of the torques acting in a warped disc in the presence of the instability .",
    "here we can only speculate on what the outcome might be .",
    "since the instability feeds on the shear in the laminar flows , it is possible that it will reduce the amplitude of those flows and may therefore limit the associated torques that determine the evolution of the warp , as discussed in section  2 of paper  i. in this way the rapid diffusion of warps in keplerian discs might be ameliorated , allowing warps to survive more readily .",
    "although we have considered only axisymmetric instabilities ( @xmath72 ) in this paper , non - axisymmetric shearing waves are also likely to be amplified , if only transiently .",
    "the nonlinear evolution could be computed initially with two - dimensional simulations ( independent of @xmath177 ) , although the behaviour in three dimensions may be different .",
    "it will also be important to determine the interaction of a warp and its associated hydrodynamic instability with the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) in discs that are sufficiently coupled to a magnetic field .",
    "this can be done by solving the mhd equations in a warped shearing box .",
    "if the mri is sufficiently powerful , it may suppress the hydrodynamic instability ; the presence of a magnetic field will certainly modify the low - frequency part of the spectrum of waves in the disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , if the warp and its associated flows are sufficiently strong , their effects are bound to dominate over the mri .",
    "indeed , @xcite were able to make a numerical study of the interaction between the mri and the horizontal shearing motions associated with a warp , and found evidence that the hydrodynamic instability dominates if the shear is sufficiently strong .",
    "the model we have investigated in this paper is intentionally simplified by being isothermal . if the disc is stably stratified , buoyancy forces will modify the details of the instability by replacing the inertial waves with inertia - gravity waves .",
    "however , since buoyancy forces vanish at the midplane , their effect may be limited .",
    "even warps that are too small to be observable may have important dynamical consequences for astrophysical discs .",
    "the main reason for this is the coincidence of the orbital and epicyclic frequencies in a keplerian disc .",
    "a warp that is stationary , or nearly so , in a non - rotating frame , implies oscillatory pressure gradients that drive horizontal shearing motions close to resonance .",
    "the simplest laminar flow solutions provide a large torque that leads to the anomalously rapid diffusion or propagation of warps in keplerian discs that has been noted in previous work .",
    "however , these flows are often linearly unstable and will be replaced by more complicated solutions and associated torques that remain to be computed .",
    "this dynamics will alter the evolution of warped discs .",
    "it also has the potential to introduce non - trivial hydrodynamic behaviour in the form of turbulence , or at least wave activity , in discs with very small warps , especially if no other form of turbulence is present .",
    "this effect could be important , for example , in activating the dead zones of protoplanetary discs if there is any small misalignment in the system such as that caused by a planet or a distant binary companion on an inclined orbit .",
    "we have used a local model , the warped shearing sheet , to compute the laminar flows and to analyse their linear stability in keplerian and non - keplerian warped discs .",
    "hydrodynamic instability derives from the parametric resonance of inertial waves and is widespread , especially when the viscosity is low or the rotation is close to keplerian .",
    "our analysis is closely related to that of @xcite , but is more detailed and is based on the nonlinear laminar flow solutions computed in a warped shearing sheet",
    ".    future work on warped discs ought to include numerical simulations of the nonlinear outcome of the hydrodynamic instability in the warped shearing box in two or three dimensions , and also of its interaction with the magnetorotational instability .",
    "the linear analysis presented in this paper should provide some initial guidance for this work .",
    "closely related problems exist for eccentric discs and tidally distorted discs . in both cases the non - circular streamlines present the fluid with an oscillating geometry that leads to the parametric excitation of inertial waves .",
    "these are versions of the elliptical instability , well known in fluid dynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus @xcite analysed the elliptical instability of tidally distorted discs and @xcite computed its nonlinear evolution in a two - dimensional local model , while analysed the elliptical instability of eccentric discs . in each case",
    "the level of hydrodynamic activity that can be expected is limited by the ellipticity of the flow .",
    "an important difference in the case of warped discs is that coincidence of the orbital and epicyclic frequencies in a keplerian disc leads to a resonant enhancement of the internal flows , so that even a very small warp may produce significant hydrodynamic activity .",
