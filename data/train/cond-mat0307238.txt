    "the hubbard model@xcite and its generalizations play a key role in the description of strongly correlated fermion systems such as high-@xmath6 superconductors , heavy fermions systems , or organic conductors . @xcite despite its simplicity ( the model is defined by two parameters , the inter - site hopping amplitude @xmath7 and the local coulomb interaction @xmath2 , and the symmetry of the lattice ) , exact solutions or well - controlled approximations exist only in a few special cases like in one - dimension@xcite ( 1d ) or in the limit of infinite dimension.@xcite    it is now well established that the ground state of the _ half - filled _ hubbard model on a cubic or square lattice has antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range order.@xcite in the weak - coupling limit ( @xmath8 ) , a fermi surface instability gives rise to a spin - density - wave ground state as first suggested by slater.@xcite the af long - range order produces a gap in the quasi - particle ( qp ) excitation spectrum so that the system becomes insulating below the af transition temperature . in the strong - coupling regime ( @xmath9 )",
    ", fermions are localized by the strong coulomb repulsion ( mott - hubbard localization ) , thus creating local ( magnetic ) moments on the lattice sites that are well described by the heisenberg model.@xcite these local moments order at low temperature and give rise to a mott - heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "the main difference between slater and mott - heisenberg antiferromagnets lies in the existence or absence of preformed local ( magnetic ) moments above the nel temperature @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite in the weak - coupling limit , we expect a fermi liquid phase down to temperatures very close to @xmath10 where critical af fluctuations start to grow . in the strong - coupling limit ,",
    "the system is insulating both above ( mott - hubbard insulator ) and below ( mott - heisenberg antiferromagnet ) the nel temperature .",
    "this simple view , while correct in 3d , breaks down in 2d . in 2d systems ,",
    "thermal ( classical ) fluctuations preclude a finite - temperature af phase transition , and the phase transition occurs at @xmath11 in agreement with the mermin - wagner theorem.@xcite nevertheless , below a crossover temperature @xmath0 , the system enters a renormalized classical regime where af fluctuations start to grow exponentially . below @xmath0 ,",
    "the fermi - liquid description breaks down even at weak coupling , although the system remains metallic . instead of well - defined landau s qp s , the fermion spectral function @xmath12 exhibits two ( broadened ) peaks separated by a pseudogap .    the existence of a pseudogap at weak coupling is best understood by considering the zero - temperature limit . at zero temperature",
    ", @xmath12 is expected to exhibit two peaks corresponding to the bogoliubov qp s as in the hartree - fock ( hf ) theory .",
    "these two peaks are separated by the af gap which is due to the presence of magnetic long - range order . at any finite temperature",
    ", the af long - range order disappears in 2d .",
    "however , by continuity , the two - peak structure in @xmath13 can not disappear as soon as we raise the temperature . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", the only possible scenario is that at finite by low temperature , the fermion spectral function exhibits two broadened peaks , which are precursors of the zero - temperature bogoliubov qp s , separated by a pseudogap . at strong coupling ,",
    "the zero - temperature gap survives at finite temperature since the system is a mott - hubbard insulator .",
    "the simplest description of the af ground state of the 2d half - filled hubbard model is based on the hf theory .",
    "it is known that the hf theory remains meaningful even at large @xmath2 . in particular",
    ", spin - wave modes obtained from the heisenberg model with an exchange coupling @xmath14 can be reproduced from a random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) calculation about the af hf solution .",
    "@xcite the influence of the spin - wave modes on the fermionic excitations has been studied within one - loop@xcite and self - consistent one - loop@xcite approximations .",
    "a qp picture for the coherent motion of a particle or a hole appears to be still valid .",
    "however , af quantum fluctuations lead to a significant reduction of the bogoliubov qp spectral weight , with a concomitant redistribution of spectral intensity into incoherent excitations , and a strong renormalization of the af gap .",
    "these conclusions are supported by numerical work on the hubbard model@xcite and , in the strong - coupling limit , by analytical or numerical analysis of the @xmath7-@xmath15 model .",
    "@xcite    in spite of its success at zero temperature , the hf theory fails in 2d since it predicts af long - range order at finite temperature . in the weak - coupling limit ,",
    "alternative approaches , which do satisfy the mermin - wagner theorem , have been proposed : moriya s self - consistent - renormalized theory,@xcite the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex ) , @xcite or the two - particle self - consistent theory .",
    "@xcite none of these approaches gives a unified description of the magnetic properties of the 2d hubbard model at finite temperature , both at weak and strong coupling .",
    "at strong coupling , in the mott - hubbard insulating state , spin degrees of freedom are usually described by the heisenberg model for which various methods are available .",
    "@xcite    beside their limitation to the weak - coupling regime , these approaches are also unable to account for the strong suppression of the amplitude fluctuations of the af order parameter at low temperature and therefore essentially describe _ gaussian _ spin fluctuations .",
    "below the crossover temperature @xmath0 , amplitude fluctuations are indeed frozen and only directional fluctuations [ i.e. ( transverse ) spin waves ] survive at low energy .",
    "the calculation of the single - particle green s function usually relies on a paramagnon - like self - energy describing free fermions that couple to gaussian order parameter fluctuations .",
    "@xcite this kind of approach has been originally introduced by lee , rice and anderson to explain the suppression of the density of states associated with order parameter fluctuations near a charge - density - wave instability .",
    "@xcite it has been since studied by many authors , in one and two dimensions .",
    "@xcite the assumption of gaussian spin fluctuations leads to an overestimation of the fermion density of states at low energy .",
    "@xcite moreover , the artificial presence of amplitude fluctuations does not allow to reach the correct @xmath16 limit .",
    "@xcite the effect of `` directional '' ( i.e. phase ) fluctuations of a complex order parameter on the fermion density of states has been studied both for incommensurate 1d peierls systems @xcite and 2d superconductors.@xcite transverse spin - wave fluctuations in the finite - temperature 2d hubbard model have not received as much attention so far .    on the experimental side , antiferromagnetism and pseudogaps",

    "our theory describes the evolution from a slater ( @xmath8 ) to a mott - heisenberg ( @xmath9 ) antiferromagnet . at finite temperature , it predicts a pseudogap at weak - coupling due to strong af fluctuations , and a mott - hubbard gap at strong coupling . since it takes into account only directional fluctuations of the af order parameter , it is valid for @xmath18 , where @xmath0 is a crossover temperature which marks the onset of af short - range order . in ref .  , one of the present authors reported a calculation of the fermion spectral function in the weak - coupling limit of the hubbard model using a nl@xmath1 m description of spin fluctuations .",
    "however , the limitations encountered by previous approaches could not be overcome .",
    "as first shown by schulz , @xcite spin fluctuations in the 2d hubbard model at low temperature can be described by a nl@xmath1 m for any value of the coulomb repulsion .",

    "at finite temperature , the system is disordered by thermal fluctuations , but the af correlation length remains exponentially large below a crossover temperature @xmath0 ( renormalized classical regime@xcite ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec0fc0spec ] , we study the fermion spectral properties . the fermion is written as the product of a schwinger boson and a pseudo - fermion whose spin is quantized along the ( fluctuating ) nel field .",
    "such a decomposition is reminiscent of slave - boson@xcite or slave - fermion @xcite theories.@xcite it allows us to approximate the fermion green s function by the product ( in direct space ) of the schwinger boson propagator ( which is obtained from the nl@xmath1 m ) and the hf fermionic propagator . at weak - coupling ( @xmath8 ) and zero temperature ,",
    "our results clearly describe a slater antiferromagnet . the af gap @xmath22 is exponentially small . as in the hf",
    "theory , there are well - defined bogoliubov qp s . however , because of af quantum fluctuations , their spectral weight is reduced by a factor @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) which is given by the fraction of condensed schwinger bosons in the ground state . the missing weight ( @xmath25 ) is transferred to incoherent excitations at higher energy ( @xmath26 when @xmath8 ) . as @xmath2 increases , the af gap increases and spectral weight is progressively transferred from the bogoliubov qp s to the incoherent excitation background . at strong coupling ( @xmath9 ) ,",
    "our results are typical of a mott - heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "the af gap @xmath27 is of order @xmath2 .",
    "the incoherent excitation background carries a significant fraction of spectral weight ( i.e. @xmath23 and @xmath25 are of the same order ) and extends over an energy scale of order @xmath14 above the bogoliubov qp energy @xmath28 . at finite temperature , the bogoliubov qp s disappear ( @xmath29 in the absence of bose condensation ) and only incoherent excitations survive .",
    "nevertheless , precursors of the zero - temperature bogoliubov qp s show up as sharp peaks at @xmath30 in the spectral function @xmath13 , with a width of order @xmath31 .",
    "we show that these peaks continuously evolve into the zero - temperature bogoliubov qp peaks as @xmath16 .",
    "this ensures that the spectral function @xmath13 is continuous at the @xmath11 phase transition .",
    "the high - energy incoherent excitation background is little affected by a finite temperature , but the presence of thermal af fluctuations gives rise to fermionic states below the zero - temperature af gap @xmath32 . at weak coupling ,",
    "the gap is completely filled and replaced by a pseudogap . at strong coupling , the zero - temperature gap survives at finite temperature and the system is a mott - hubbard insulator .    on the basis of a numerical calculation in the framework of the dynamical cluster approximation , moukouri and jarrell have called into question the existence of a slater scenario in the 2d half - filled hubbard model .",
    "@xcite they argue that the system is always a mott - hubbard insulator at low ( but finite ) temperature even at weak coupling .",
    "we will show that their results are not in contradiction with a slater scenario at weak coupling , but merely reflect the strong suppression of the density of states due to the pseudogap ( sec .",

    "@xcite this transformation maps the @xmath33 spin correlations of the repulsive model onto the @xmath34 pairing and @xmath35 charge correlations of the attractive model , but leaves the single - particle green s function and the spectral function @xmath13 invariant .",
    "thus the results obtained in this paper apply also to the attractive hubbard model , but with a different physical meaning ( sec .",

    ", there is a smooth crossover from a bcs to a bose - einstein behavior . at finite temperature ,",
    "the weak - coupling pseudogap is due to strong pairing and charge fluctuations , whereas the strong - coupling gap is a consequence of the presence of preformed particle - particle pairs .",

    "although this procedure recovers the standard mean - field ( or hf ) theory of the nel state within a saddle - point approximation , it leads to a loss of spin rotation invariance and does not allow to obtain the spin - wave goldstone modes .",
