    "in order to describe the current accelerated expansion of our universe , use has usually been made of a fluid with equation of state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the pressure and energy density , respectively , and @xmath3 is a parameter which is expected to be fixed by observation .",
    "observational data @xcite suggest that @xmath3 could be less than @xmath4 and , in this case , the fluid is called phantom energy . it is well known that when this phantom energy is described as a k - essence field , from which the customary quintessential fluid is nothing but a particular case , the universe will finish at the so - called big rip singularity @xcite , where the scale factor and the energy density go both to infinity and all the structures of the universe are ripped apart , outside the horizon of each other .",
    "phantom energy is most generally characterised by its violation of the classical dominant energy condition .",
    "the big rip singularity can nevertheless be shown @xcite to be avoided when the universal fluid is given in terms of a generalised chaplygin gas ( gcg ) @xcite , even when the dominant energy condition is violated , a case for which the equation of state takes on a more exotic , generally non - linear form .",
    "this conclusion can be extended to also encompass the case of the now dubbed dual gcg ( dgcg ) @xcite . in this paper",
    "it will be seen that , even though the above conclusion can be maintained in the so - named dual version of phantom @xcite , both gcg and dgcg models can predict another kind of future singularity , which might be called a big freeze singularity , as it takes place at a finite value of the scale factor and infinite positive or negative energy density . therefore , the big freeze singularity is different from the big rip singularity .",
    "in fact , the former singularity takes place at a finite scale factor while the latter occurs at an infinitely large radius .",
    "the content of this paper can be outlined as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we shall consider how in the case of a gcg with positive energy density in a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe the big freeze singularity ( a singularity type iii in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) can be obtained . the case for a dgcg occurring in a brane world of the randall - sundrum 1 type @xcite , with negative energy density",
    "is dealt with in sec .",
    "iii , where it is shown that also in that case there will appear a future big freeze singularity .",
    "we finally conclude and briefly comment on some particular aspects in sec .",
    "the phantom generalised chaplygin gas was originally introduced in @xcite .",
    "it satisfies the same equation of state as gcg @xcite , i. e. @xmath5 where a is a positive constant and @xmath6 is a parameter .",
    "if @xmath7 , eq .",
    "( [ chaplygineq ] ) corresponds to the equation of state of a chaplygin gas .",
    "the conservation of the energy momentum tensor then implies @xmath8 with @xmath9 a constant parameter .",
    "it was noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite that if the parameter @xmath9 is negative then the perfect fluid with the equation of state ( [ chaplygineq ] ) can not satisfy the null energy condition ; i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that in this case the energy density grows , instead of red - shifting as the universe expands .",
    "this kind of fluid was called a phantom generalised chaplygin gas ( pgcg ) . moreover",
    ", the authors of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) realised that if the pgcg parameter @xmath6 is larger than @xmath4 then a flrw universe filled with this fluid would escape the big rip singularity because at large scale factors the universe is asymptotically de sitter .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that if @xmath6 is smaller than @xmath4 a flrw universe filled with this fluid has a maximum finite size but did not work out the consequences in this case .    here",
    ", we will show that a pgcg ( @xmath11 positive and @xmath9 negative in eqs .",
    "( [ chaplygineq ] ) and ( [ rhopcg ] ) ) induces a singularity at a finite future cosmic time and for a finite scale factor in a homogeneous and isotropic universe if @xmath6 is smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "this singularity is different from a big rip singularity and we name it a big freeze singularity . in this case , it turns out that the pgcg energy density is an increasing function of the scale factor ( see eq .",
    "( [ rhopcg ] ) ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 approaches @xmath12 at very small values of the scale factor ( @xmath13 ) and blows up at a finite scale factor @xmath14 ( see fig.[plotrhopcg ] ) @xmath15 therefore , a flrw universe filled with a pgcg would face a future singularity at a finite radius @xcite .",
    "moreover , close to the singularity the cosmological evolution can be described as    @xmath16^{\\frac{2(1+\\alpha)}{1 + 2\\alpha}}a^{\\frac{1}{1 + 2\\alpha } }    \\label{friedmann4d}\\ ] ]    for simplicity , we have assumed that the 3-dimensional spatial sections of the flrw universe are flat .",
    "hereafter , we shall use units such that @xmath17 , @xmath18 . in eq .",
    "( [ friedmann4d ] ) @xmath19 measures the cosmic time elapsed since the universe has a given scale factor @xmath20 ( @xmath20 is close to @xmath21 ) till it has its maximum size ; i.e. @xmath22 . it was previously pointed out in refs @xcite that a singularity at a finite scale factor can take place in a universe filled by a gcg . here",
    "we have proven that this singularity not only takes place at a finite scale factor but also at a finite future cosmic time .",
    "on the other hand , a flrw universe filled with this fluid is asymptotically de sitter in the past . in fact,@xmath23 where @xmath24 is a small scale factor .",
    "moreover , the flrw universe starts its evolution at a past infinite cosmic time where @xmath13 and @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , the homogeneous and isotropic universe super - accelerates ; i.e. @xmath26 all the way until it hits the singularity at @xmath27 . in the previous equation , a dot stands for derivative respect to the cosmic time .",
    "we recall that the pgcg does not satisfy the null energy condition @xcite ; i.e. @xmath10 .    in the next section",
    ", we will show that the same singularity ; i.e. a big freeze , may show up in the brane - world scenario even for a fluid that satisfy the null energy condition . in fact , this can be the case for a dual of the phantom generalised chaplygin gas .",
    "for a given phantom energy model described by a perfect fluid , we define its dual as a perfect fluid which satisfies a similar equation of state with @xmath28 but fulfils the null energy condition @xcite . here",
    "@xmath3 corresponds to the ratio between the pressure and the energy density of the perfect fluid .",
    "this definition of dual has not to be confused with the one used in ref .",
    "despite the very weird property of the dual of a phantom energy model that its energy density is negative @xcite , it may supply an alternative to dark energy models in theories with modified friedmann equation like the brane - world scenario @xcite .",
    "in fact , this might be the case in randall - sundrum model with a unique brane ( rs1 ) @xcite where the modified friedmann equation on the brane reads @xcite @xmath29 for simplicity , we consider the flat chart of the brane . in the previous equation @xmath30",
    "is the brane tension which we assume positive .",
    "consequently , the square of the hubble parameter in rs1 scenario is well defined for a negative energy density @xmath2 as long as @xmath31 ; i.e. as long as the effective energy density of the brane is positive . moreover , the brane is super - inflating ; i.e. the hubble parameter is an increasing function of the brane cosmic time @xmath32 it follows that a brane filled with the dual of a phantom energy is always accelerating ; i.e. @xmath33 .",
    "the brane is super - inflating although the dual of the phantom energy satisfies the null energy density ; ie .",
    "@xmath34 , because @xmath2 is negative and smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "we remind the reader that the effective energy density of the brane is positive and is is well behaved ( except at the singularity ) .",
    "this is a trademark of any dual of a phantom energy model .",
    "from now on , we will consider that the brane is filled with a dual of the phantom generalised chaplygin gas ( dgcg ) @xcite . in this setup",
    ", we will show how future singularities may show up at a finite scale factor and in a finite future cosmic time ; i.e. a big freeze , on a brane filled by this fluid .",
    "indeed , this is the case , for example , for a dgcg , therefore satisfying the polytropic equation of state ( [ chaplygineq ] ) , whose energy density reads @xmath36 where @xmath11 is a negative constant , @xmath9 a positive constant and @xmath37 an integer .",
    "as can be seen , a commonness of the dgcg is that the parameter @xmath6 is quantised ; in this case @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath37 is positive , the brane faces a curvature singularity at a finite scale factor @xmath14 where @xmath39 when the brane reaches its maximum size , the energy density diverges ( cf .",
    "( [ rhodpcg ] ) ) .",
    "this feature is schematically shown in figs .",
    "[ rhodpcg1 ] and [ rhodpcg2 ] .",
    "it can be easily checked that close to the singularity the scale factor can be approximated by    @xmath40.\\ ] ]    here @xmath41 is positive and constant .",
    "it corresponds to the future finite cosmic time ( @xmath41 ) at which the brane hits the big freeze singularity .",
    "we would like to stress that the singularity is intrinsic to the brane .",
    "in fact , the bulk geometry is well - defined as it corresponds to two symmetric pieces of a 5-dimensional anti - de sitter space - time split by the brane .    on the other hand , depending on",
    "how large is the brane tension @xmath30 ( for positive @xmath37 ) , the brane starts its evolution at a vanishing scale factor or at a finite non - vanishing scale factor @xmath42 : @xmath43^{\\frac{1 + 2n}{3}}.\\label{alambda}\\ ] ] in fact , if the initial energy density of the brane is smaller than @xmath35 ; i.e. @xmath44 , the brane starts its evolution with a vanishing scale factor ( see fig .",
    "[ rhodpcg1 ] ) . in this case , the brane is asymptotically de sitter in the past and its initial evolution can be approximated by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a very small scale factor and @xmath47 is the initial / primordial hubble parameter .",
    "therefore , the brane is born at an infinite past cosmic time because @xmath20 vanishes at @xmath48 .",
    "now , if the initial energy density of the dgcg is larger than the brane tension ; i.e. @xmath49 , the brane starts its evolution with a non - vanishing radius @xmath42 ( see fig .",
    "[ rhodpcg2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the brane tension acts as a high energy cut off on @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this feature implies that @xmath30 forbids an infinite past of the brane .",
    "indeed , close to the initial scale factor @xmath42 , the cosmological evolution can be described as    @xmath50^{\\frac{2 - 2n}{3}}(t - t_{\\lambda})^2\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    where at @xmath51 , the brane radius coincides with @xmath42 . in summary , we have shown that a dgcg for @xmath37 positive ( see eq .  [ rhodpcg ] ) induces a future singularity at a finite future cosmic time @xmath52 and for a finite radius of the brane @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , we have also shown that depending on how large is the brane tension , the brane starts its evolution with a vanishing radius at an infinite past or with a finite radius @xmath42 at a finite past @xmath53 ( as measured by the cosmic time of the brane ) . at this respect",
    ", we would like to emphasise that we are considering only the phase where the brane expands .",
    "it is worth noticing that the expansion phase is preceded by a collapsing phase with negative hubble parameter .",
    "it can be also seen that the latter phase starts with a past freeze singularity .    before concluding this section , we describe briefly the evolution of a brane filled by a dgcg whose energy density is given by eq .",
    "( [ rhodpcg ] ) for @xmath37 negative ( for more details see ref .",
    "first of all , the minimum energy density of the dgcg must be smaller than @xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "[ rhodpcg3 ] ) ; i.e. @xmath54 , otherwise the brane can not have a lorentzian evolution . under this assumption",
    ", it turns out that the brane is asymptotically de sitter in the future despite that the dgcg energy density is negative ( see fig .",
    "[ rhodpcg3 ] ) . at this respect , we recall that the modified friedmann equation on the brane is quadratic on the total energy density of the brane ( cf .",
    "( [ friedmannrs ] ) ) .",
    "in addition , the effective energy density of the brane is positive .",
    "the brane tension acts again as a high energy cut off on the dgcg energy density .",
    "consequently , the brane starts its evolution at a non - vanishing scale factor @xmath42 , previously introduced in eq .",
    "( [ alambda ] ) .",
    "therefore , the brane tension excludes those radii of the brane such that @xmath55 , where the energy density vanishes at @xmath56 .",
    "this cut off effect implies that the brane starts its evolution at a finite past cosmic time as measured by an observer confined on the brane .",
    "we have seen how gcg and dgcg could generate a new big freeze singularity ( a singularity type iii in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) which would be associated with a different way for the universe to finish along a doomsday . at this doomsday",
    "the universe would be infinitely full with phantom energy while it would have a finite size , in contrast with a doomsday _  la _ big rip .",
    "thus , nothing in the universe could move around , producing a freezing for all the eternity .",
    "close to a big rip singularity , the classical space - time breaks down and therefore a quantum analysis at large scale factors is required @xcite .",
    "we expect similarly the quantum effects to be also important close to a big freeze singularity and consequently at intermediate values of the scale factor . in particular , the kind of big freeze singularity we have found in this paper needs an analysis of the gcg from a quantum point of view @xcite .",
