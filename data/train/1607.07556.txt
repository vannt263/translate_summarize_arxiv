    "this method has proven to work well in extensive numerical tests , see @xcite . in the present paper , we give a rigorous error analysis of this method , showing first - order convergence in time and high - order convergence in space depending on the regularity of the exact solution . the error bound holds under a mild cfl - type step - size restriction on the discretization parameters . in view of the proven temporal and spatial error bounds ,",
    "this cfl condition is a natural restriction on the discretization parameters .    at first glance , an error analysis of splitting methods applied to might seem an easy exercise in view of the available error analysis for splitting methods applied to semilinear schrdinger equations @xcite and semilinear wave equations @xcite",
    "this , however , is not the case , essentially because there is a formal _ loss of spatial regularity _ ( loss of spatial derivatives ) in the zakharov system that a numerical method and its analysis have to handle .",
    "in fact , an inspection of the wave equation in suggests that @xmath6 is in the sobolev space @xmath7 for some @xmath8 only if @xmath9 is in the sobolev space @xmath10 of higher order .",
    "an inspection of the schrdinger equation in suggests , however , that @xmath9 has no higher regularity than @xmath11 , which is @xmath12 .",
    "see also the introduction of @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that this loss of spatial regularity is formal in the sense that it only appears in a naive and formal analysis , while it can be shown , with more sophisticated arguments , to not affect the actual ( exact ) solution .",
    "the formal loss of spatial regularity is a major difficulty in the numerical analysis of the zakharov system .",
    "the problem is that a loss of regularity might be also present in a numerical method , or at least in its ( naive ) analysis . typically , _",
    "implicit _ or _ semi - implicit _ methods can be designed to avoid this potential loss of regularity , and indeed they have been introduced and analyzed for the zakharov system in @xcite .",
    "more recently , however , several _ explicit _ splitting methods have been introduced @xcite , among them the method of jin , markowich & zheng @xcite that we consider here .",
    "these explicit methods performed well in numerous numerical test , but rigorous error bounds for them seem to be missing so far .",
    "in fact , direct estimates for such methods , as used in the mentioned papers on schrdinger and wave equations , can not exclude a loss of spatial regularity of the numerical solution in each time step , see section  [ sec - exp ] .    in the present paper",
    ", we give an error analysis for such an explicit method .",
    "the main tool is a transformation of the numerical solution to new variables . in these new variables ,",
    "a loss of spatial regularity can be excluded and an error analysis is in fact possible , leading finally to error bounds in the original variables .",
    "the transformation that we use is a discrete analogon of a transformation introduced by ozawa & tsutsumi in @xcite for the analysis of the zakharov system itself .",
    "we mention that this latter transformation has been put to numerical use by herr & schratz in @xcite in a conceptually different way than here .",
    "they start from the zakharov system in the new variables of @xcite and design and analyze a new numerical method for the system in these new variables . in contrast , we translate here the transformation of @xcite to a discrete level and show how this helps to analyze an existing and well - established numerical method .    the techniques developed in the present paper",
    "can also be used to analyze the extension of the considered lie ",
    "trotter splitting to a ( formally ) second - order strang splitting for the zakharov system , as considered also in @xcite .",
    "we expect that the techniques can in addition be used to prove error bounds for the splitting integrators of bao , sun & wei @xcite for the zakharov system .",
    "moreover , we expect them to be useful to analyze numerical methods for other equations with a formal loss of spatial derivatives , for which a transformation to new variables without loss of derivatives is available for the exact solution , for example for derivative nonlinear schrdinger equations  @xcite . from a technical point of view",
    ", the present paper provides a new technique to analyze ( explicit ) numerical methods for hyperbolic equations , where a formal loss of spatial regularity is problematic .",
    "previous techniques for that purpose include energy estimates used for quasilinear wave equations @xcite and special regularity results for the inviscid burgers equation used for the kdv equation @xcite and for partial differential equations with burgers nonlinearity @xcite .",
