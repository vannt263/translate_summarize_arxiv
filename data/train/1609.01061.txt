    "graph invariants constitute an interesting tool in chemistry , communication or engineering @xcite . in mathematics ,",
    "one of the topics for which graph invariants have revealed to play an important role is the classical problem of deciding whether two algebras are isomorphic .",
    "this problem is usually dealt with by computing the reduced grbner basis of the system of polynomial equations that is uniquely related to the structure constants of both algebras .",
    "this computation is , however , very sensitive to the number of variables @xcite and gives rise to distinct problems of computation time and memory usage even for low - dimensional algebras @xcite .",
    "this paper deals with graph theory in order to reduce this cost of computation .",
    "graph invariants have been proposed in the last years as an efficient alternative to study isomorphisms of distinct types of algebras @xcite .",

    "these functors map isomorphic and isotopic algebras to isomorphic graphs .",
    "reciprocally , any pair of isomorphic graphs is uniquely related to a pair of algebras so that there exists a multiplicative map between them .",
    "the main advantage of our proposal , apart from the reduction of the mentioned cost of computation , is the feasibility of studying the possible isomorphism between two given finite - dimensional algebras defined over the same field , whatever the types of both algebras are . as an illustrative example , we focus in section 4 on the classification of partial quasigroup rings according to the known isotopism classes of partial latin squares on which they are based .",
