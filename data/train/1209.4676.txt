    "<S> using long - slit optical spectroscopy obtained at the 10.4 m gran telescopio canarias , we have examined the gaseous environment of the radio - loud quasar txs 1436 + 157 ( z=2.54 ) , previously known to be associated with a large ly@xmath0 nebula and a spatially extended ly@xmath0-absorbing structure . from the ly@xmath0 nebula we measure kinematic properties consistent with infall at a rate of @xmath110 - 100 @xmath2 yr@xmath3  more than sufficient to power a quasar at the top of the luminosity function .    </S>",
    "<S> the absorbing structure lies outside of the ly@xmath0 nebula , at a radius of @xmath440 kpc from the quasar . against the bright unresolved continuum and line emission from the quasar , we detect in absorption the nv @xmath51239,1241 , civ@xmath51548,1551 and siiv @xmath51394,1403 doublets , with no unambiguous detection of absorption lines from any low - ionization species of metal . </S>",
    "<S> the metal column densities , taken together with the hi column density measurement from the literature , indicate that the absorbing gas is predominantly ionized by the quasar , has a mass of hydrogen of @xmath6 m@xmath7 , a gas density of @xmath818 @xmath9 , a line of sight thickness of @xmath1018 pc , and a covering factor approaching unity . while this absorbing structure is clearly not composed of pristine gas , it has an extremely low metallicity , with ionization models providing a 3@xmath11 limit of 12+log(o / h)@xmath87.3 .    </S>",
    "<S> to explain these results , we discuss a scenario involving starburst - driven superbubbles and the creation of infalling filaments of cold gas which fuel / trigger the quasar . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the possibility of detecting large - scale absorbers such as this in emission when illuminated by a powerful quasar .    </S>",
