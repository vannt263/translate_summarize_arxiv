    "galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe and can be observed out to high redshift , providing a rich source of information on the history of structure formation .",
    "the form of cluster evolution with look - back time is a very sensitive probe of hierarchical structure formation models . assuming a cdm - like power spectrum and a self - similar model for structure evolution",
    ", @xcite predicted that the comoving number density of clusters should increase with redshift , i.e. positive evolution .",
    "more sophisticated analytic and n - body models , which include gravitational instability theory and hydrodynamics , predict a decrease in the number density of clusters with redshift ( negative evolution ) for only the very brightest clusters ( x - ray luminosities , @xmath6 ) , with little evolution at lower luminosities ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "until recently the only available distant cluster catalogues were optically selected , showing little evidence for evolution in the cluster space density out to @xmath7 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , one of the most intriguing results to emerge in recent years is the lack of high redshift x - ray luminous clusters in the einstein extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss , @xcite ; henry et al .",
    "1992 ) and other x - ray surveys ( @xcite ) .",
    "these studies concluded that there has been significant negative evolution over short look - back times in the bright end of the cluster x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) .",
    "the evolution found by edge et al .",
    "( 1990 ) is likely to be the result of unfortunate sampling in the redshift range @xmath8 ( @xcite ) , while the evidence for negative evolution reported by @xcite is critically examined by @xcite using rosat pointed observations of emss clusters .",
    "we are now able to test the negative evolution scenario using the publicly available data archive of the rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) .",
    "the greater spatial resolution and sensitivity , combined with the lower background , of the rosat pspc compared to the einstein ipc means that cluster samples can be compiled to a flux limit an order of magnitude fainter than that of the emss .",
    "we have carried out a survey for serendipitously detected x - ray clusters from the pspc data archive in order to study the cluster population at high redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "this project is referred to as the serendipitous high - redshift archival rosat cluster survey ( sharc ) , although our selection technique is completely different to that described in @xcite , who use a source detection algorithm based on a wavelet transform to re - examine the emss cluster sample .",
    "there are several groups currently using the pspc database to compile distant cluster surveys ( rixos , castander et al .",
    "1995 ; rdcs , @xcite ; warps , @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to report on the number of spectroscopically confirmed high redshift clusters in our survey and to compare our results with those of other groups . in particular we make a direct comparison with rixos , who have claimed that the dearth of high redshift clusters in their sample strengthens the claims of negative evolution ( castander et al . 1995 ) . in this letter",
    "we use @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the rosat pspc provides wide field imaging capabilities with moderate spatial and spectral resolution ( @xcite ) . on axis",
    "the pspc has a psf with a fwhm of 25  at 1  and an energy resolution @xmath11 over the range @xmath12 .",
    "although the instrument has a 1  radius field of view , the off axis psf degradation and the vignetting caused by the window support structure generally limit analysis to within a radius of 18 . the x - ray emission from rich clusters of galaxies",
    "is spatially extended , with a surface brightness profile well fit by a king profile : @xmath13 with a core radius ( @xmath14 ) of 200  500 kpc and @xmath15 ( @xcite ) . assuming no evolution in @xmath14 and @xmath16 , clusters can be resolved out to @xmath17 by the pspc .",
    "ideally we would like to optically identify all the x - ray sources in our survey , regardless of extent .",
    "however , agn are the primary x - ray source population at flux limits of @xmath18 ( @xcite ) , outnumbering clusters by 10 to 1 .",
    "since x - ray emission from agn is unresolved by the pspc , we can significantly reduce the contamination these sources introduce into our survey by restricting our attention to extended sources only .",
    "clusters have typical icm temperatures of 2  10   ( @xcite ) , so we can reduce the contamination from soft sources and galactic emission by restricting our analysis to the  pass band .",
    "our survey consists of 66 deep rosat pointings which satisfy the following criteria : exposure times greater than 10 ks , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the galactic neutral hydrogen column density for these fields varies between 2 and 7 @xmath21 which , together with the average exposure time of @xmath22 ks , results in an average flux limit @xmath2 . due to the degradation of both the psf and the detector effective area with off - axis position , we limit our survey to the central 18  of each field , which results in a total survey area of @xmath23 , after masking out the original targets of the observations .",
    "briefly , the analysis begins with screening out data taken during periods of high aspect error or particle background .",
    "we compute a global estimate of the background and use a sliding box technique , with a detect cell size of 30 , coupled with the cash statistic ( @xcite ) to search for sources .",
    "these sources are tested for extent by comparing the photon distribution to the psf , modelling both the positional and spectral dependence of the psf .",
    "those sources which show significant ( @xmath24 ) angular extent are flagged as cluster candidates .",
    "the degree of completeness in our survey depends heavily on the extent of the cluster x - ray emission and the sensitivity of the extended source algorithm ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "our detection method is designed to pick - up moderately extended sources of size @xmath25 1  which is a good match to the expected angular size of clusters in the range @xmath26 . at this stage",
    "we do not know to what extent our completeness is compromised by ignoring intrinsically unresolved sources .",
    "however , both the surveys of georgantopoulos et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and rixos , which have optically identified all point sources in deep rosat pspc fields , detect very few clusters with point - like x - ray emission ( @xcite ; @xcite , private communication ) .",
    "in addition , we are in the process of carrying out simulations to estimate the completeness and the sensitivity of our selection method to sources of different fluxes with sizes ranging from point - like to very extended ( @xmath27 1 ) .    we have carried out an optical identification programme of the extended sources , obtaining both imaging and multi - object spectroscopy using the european southern observatory 3.6 m and the anglo - australian 3.9 m telescopes .",
    "typically we have redshifts for @xmath28 galaxies per cluster .",
    "our final sample consists of clusters which satisfy the joint criteria of both extended x - ray emission and multiple redshifts , which ensures minimal contamination from agn .",
    "full details of the survey , including the cluster identification procedure , redshift reduction and an estimate of the survey completeness from simulations will be given in a forthcoming paper ( burke et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . as a result of the optical observations we have identified  clusters ranging from nearby poor clusters to high redshift rich clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig : contours ] shows our four most distant clusters with x - ray contours overlaid on ccd r band images .",
    "we have spectroscopically confirmed a total of  clusters over an area of @xmath3 , giving a cluster surface density of @xmath4 ( @xmath29 poisson errors taken from @xcite ) .",
    "two surveys designed to detect very extended sources in rosat pspc pointings have recently published surface densities of extended sources found in the   band : rdcs use a wavelet transform algorithm and report a surface density of @xmath30  at a flux limit of @xmath31 ; warps use a voronoi tesselation and percolation algorithm and detect 2.1 - 3.1  above an intrinsic flux limit of @xmath32 . although neither sample is fully identified ( @xcite report spectroscopic confirmation for a subset of their sample whereas @xcite leave discussing their optical follow up to a future paper ) , their results are similar to our surface density of spectroscopically confirmed clusters .    in table",
    "[ tbl : survey ] we summarise our survey statistics along with those of rixos and show the corresponding redshift distributions in figure  [ fig : nz ] . despite the similarity of the surveys in terms of limiting x - ray flux and total area surveyed , it is immediately apparent that we detect many more high redshift clusters than rixos ; beyond @xmath33 we find @xmath0 clusters compared to their 4 .",
    "using poisson statistics , the probability that this difference could arise by chance is @xmath34 and is therefore ruled out at a significance of @xmath35",
    ". the lack of high redshift clusters in the rixos sample could be due to their detection method , as suggested by @xcite , or due to optical misclassification .",
    "we examine the redshift histogram in figure  [ fig : nz ] for evidence of evolution by predicting the expected number of clusters in the interval @xmath36 using the low redshift cluster xlf of @xcite . for clusters at lower redshifts ,",
    "the results become unreliable due to the small volume sampled and the uncertainties in the xlf at low luminosities .",
    "a similar calculation was carried out by @xcite for the rixos survey using the cluster xlf of edge et al .",
    "the cluster xlf of @xcite is well matched to our dataset since it is a purely x - ray selected cluster sample , identified from the rosat all sky survey .",
    "the differential xlf , @xmath37 , is modelled using a schechter function , @xmath38 where 44  is the x - ray luminosity in units of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    using this model",
    "we can estimate the number of high redshift clusters we expect to detect by integrating equation  [ eqn : schechter ] above the minimum detectable luminosity for each redshift interval .",
    "the exposure time , background count rate and a model of the off axis behaviour of the psf ( @xcite ) are used to predict the minimum detectable count rate at each redshift , after correcting for the flux falling outside the detection cell using equation  [ eqn : sb ] , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 kpc .",
    "we use a 6  thermal bremsstrahlung model to convert count rates to fluxes , which are then corrected for galactic absorption and k - corrected to the  band .",
    "both our survey and the emss have a flux limit which varies from field to field . while this complicates the analysis , the @xmath45 method used by @xcite fully corrects for this effect and our procedure follows the same technique .",
    "the results summarised in table [ tbl : survey ] demonstrate that in the redshift intervals @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the number of x - ray clusters predicted and observed differ by only @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively . despite the possibility of residual incompleteness our data provides no evidence for the negative evolution reported by @xcite .    to test whether uncertainties in the local xlf",
    "can bias this analysis , we have repeated the calculation using the cluster xlf of @xcite , which is not strictly x - ray selected , but based partly on the optical catalogues of abell and zwicky .",
    "the xlf is modelled as before , with @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , over the energy range @xmath12 .",
    "converting to the  band , we predict @xmath53 clusters between @xmath54 and @xmath55 clusters between @xmath1 .",
    "these results are virtually identical to those obtained above , indicating that our predictions are insensitive to potential biases in the local xlf .",
    "one difference between our survey and rixos is that , in common with emss , our flux limit varies with the exposure time and galactic neutral hydrogen column density of each observation , with an rms variation of @xmath56 , whereas rixos impose a constant flux limit of @xmath57 across all fields .",
    "therefore one possibility is that the ` missing ' clusters lie in our deepest fields , with fluxes below the rixos flux limit .",
    "however , if we replace the individual flux limits of each field with the average value quoted in table  [ tbl : survey ] , the predicted number of clusters remains essentially unchanged , @xmath58 compared with @xmath59 .",
    "hence the deeper fields in our survey do not unduly bias our results .",
    "we have carried out a redshift survey of extended sources selected from the rosat pspc pointed data archive over an area of @xmath3   and to a depth of  in the energy range .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up observations have produced a sample of distant x - ray selected galaxy clusters .",
    "the surface density of our spectroscopically confirmed cluster sample is @xmath4 , in good agreement with the number density of cluster candidates detected using algorithms designed to search for very extended sources ( rdcs and warps ) .",
    "in addition , the redshift histogram of our clusters is consistent with a simple extrapolation of the local luminosity function of x - ray clusters from @xcite .",
    "this indicates that no substantial negative evolution has taken place in the cluster population over the redshift range @xmath1 .",
    "after this manuscript was accepted we spectroscopically confirmed a further cluster at @xmath60 from service observations carried out on the 4.2 m wht .",
    "this completes the identification of extended sources and brings the number of clusters in our survey which are beyond @xmath5 to 16 , which marginally increases the discrepancy between our sample and that of rixos .",
