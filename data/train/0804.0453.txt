    "more precisely , we assume that @xmath4 is a separable metric space and that @xmath5 is a borel probability measure on @xmath4 which is not a unit mass at a point .",
    "although it is not essential for the ensuing discussion , it will be more convenient to specialize to the case where @xmath6 is a complete smooth oriented @xmath7-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the induced geodesic distance , and @xmath5 is an absolutely continuous measure with respect to the riemannian volume form @xmath10 on @xmath11 .",
    "this work continues the study of interplay between the metric @xmath9 and the measure @xmath5 initiated in @xcite .",
    "there are various different ways to measure this relationship , which may be typically arranged according to strength , forming a hierarchy . in this work ,",
    "we will be primarily concerned with two such different ways .",
    "the first way is by means of an isoperimetric inequality .",
    "recall that minkowski s ( exterior ) boundary measure of a borel set @xmath12 , which we denote here by @xmath13 , is defined as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the @xmath16-extension of @xmath17 with respect to the metric @xmath9 .",
    "it is clear that this boundary measure is a natural generalization of the notion of surface area to the metric probability space setting .",
    "an isoperimetric inequality measures the relation between @xmath13 and @xmath18 by means of the isoperimetric profile @xmath19 , defined as the pointwise maximal function @xmath20 \\rightarrow { \\mathbb{r}}_+$ ] , so that : @xmath21 for all borel sets @xmath22 .",
    "although it is possible to guarantee under very general conditions that the function @xmath23 is symmetric about the point @xmath24 , we will not assume this , and instead define @xmath25 as the function @xmath26 \\rightarrow { \\mathbb{r}}_+$ ] given by : @xmath27    a well known example of an isoperimetric inequality was defined by cheeger @xcite .",
    "we will say that our space satisfies _",
    "cheeger s isoperimetric inequality _",
    ", if there exists a constant @xmath28 so that @xmath29 for all @xmath30 $ ] ; we denote the best constant @xmath31 by @xmath32 .",
    "another useful example pertains to the standard gaussian measure @xmath33 on @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the euclidean metric .",
    "we will say that our space satisfies a _",
    "gaussian isoperimetric inequality _",
    ", if there exists a constant @xmath28 so that @xmath36 for all @xmath37 $ ] ; we denote the best constant @xmath31 by @xmath38 .",

    "the gaussian isoperimetric inequality can therefore be equivalently stated as asserting that there exists a constant @xmath28 so that @xmath43 for all @xmath30 $ ] .    a second way to measure the interplay between @xmath9 and @xmath5",
    "is given by functional inequalities .",
    "let @xmath44 denote the space of functions which are lipschitz on every ball in @xmath4 - we will call such functions `` lipschitz - on - balls '' - and let @xmath45 .",
    "we will consider functional inequalities which compare between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 are some norms associated with the measure @xmath5 , like the @xmath49 norms , or some other more general _",
    "orlicz quasi - norms _ associated to the class @xmath50 of increasing continuous functions mapping @xmath51 onto @xmath51 ( see subsection [ subsect : definitions ] for precise definitions ) . here",
    ", the effect of the metric @xmath9 is via the riemannian metric @xmath52 which is used to measure @xmath53 , although more general ways exist to define @xmath54 in the non - manifold setting .",
    "there is clearly no point to test constant functions , so it will be natural to require that either the expectation @xmath55 or median @xmath56 of @xmath57 are 0 .",
    "here @xmath58 and @xmath56 is a value so that @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we will say that the space @xmath3 satisfies an @xmath61 orlicz - sobolev inequality ( @xmath62 ) if : @xmath63    a similar ( yet different ) definition was given by roberto and zegarlinski @xcite in the case @xmath64 following the work of mazya @xcite .",
    "our preference to use the median @xmath65 in our definition ( in place of the more standard expectation @xmath66 ) is immaterial whenever @xmath67 is a convex function ( see lemma [ lem : e - m ] ) .",
    "when @xmath68 , in which case @xmath69 is just the usual @xmath49 norm , we will refer to the inequality ( [ eq : os - inq - def ] ) as a _ @xmath70 poincar inequality_. if in addition @xmath65 in ( [ eq : os - inq - def ] ) is replaced by @xmath66 , the case @xmath71 is then just the classical _ poincar inequality _ , and we denote the best constant in this inequality by @xmath72 . similarly , the case @xmath73 corresponds to the _ gagliardo  nirenberg  sobolev inequality _ , and a limitting case when @xmath7 tends to infinity is the so - called _ log - sobolev inequality_. more generally , we say that our space satisfies a _ @xmath0-log - sobolev inequality _ ( @xmath1 $ ] ) , if there exists a constant @xmath28 so that : @xmath74 the best possible constant @xmath31 above is denoted by @xmath75 .",
    "although these inequalities do not precisely fit into our announced framework , it follows from the work of bobkov and zegarlinski @xcite that they are in fact equivalent to some corresponding orlicz - sobolev inequalities ( see section [ sec : general ] ) .",
    "various other functional inequalities admit an equivalent ( up to universal constants ) formulation using an appropriate orlicz norm @xmath69 on the left hand side of ( [ eq : os - inq - def ] ) .",
    "we refer the reader to the recent paper of barthe and kolesnikov @xcite and the references therein for an account of several other types of functional inequalities .",
    "it is well known that various isoperimetric inequalities imply their functional `` counterparts '' .",
    "it was shown by mazya @xcite and independently by cheeger @xcite , to whom this is usually attributed , that cheeger s isoperimetric inequality implies poincar s inequality : @xmath76 ( cheeger s inequality ) .",
    "it was first observed by m. ledoux @xcite that a gaussian isoperimetric inequality implies a @xmath77-log - sobolev inequality : @xmath78 , for some universal constant @xmath79 .",
    "this has been later refined by beckner ( see @xcite ) using an equivalent functional form of the gaussian isoperimetric inequality due to s. bobkov @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath80 .",
    "the constants @xmath77 and @xmath81 above are known to be optimal .      in general , it is known that these implications _ can not _ be reversed .",
    "for instance , using @xmath82,{\\left\\vert\\cdot\\right\\vert},\\mu_\\alpha)$ ] where @xmath83 on @xmath84 $ ] , clearly @xmath85 ) = 0 $ ] so @xmath86 , whereas one can show that @xmath87 for @xmath88 using criteria for the poincar and @xmath77-log - sobolev inequalities on @xmath89 due to kac and krein @xcite ( and also artola , talenti and tomaselli , cf .",
    "muckenhoupt @xcite ) and bobkov and gtze @xcite , respectively .",
    "we conclude that in order to have any chance of reversing the above implications , we will need to add some additional assumptions , which will prevent the existence of examples as above .",
    "as we will see below , some type of convexity assumptions are a natural candidate .",
    "we start with two important examples when @xmath90 and @xmath35 is some fixed euclidean norm :    * @xmath6 is an _",
    "arbitrary _ bounded convex domain in @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , and @xmath5 is the uniform probability measure on @xmath6 . *",
    "@xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) and @xmath5 is an _ arbitrary _ absolutely continuous log - concave probability measure , meaning that @xmath95 where @xmath96 is convex ( we refer to the paper @xcite of c. borell for more information ) .    in both cases",
    ", we will say that `` our convexity assumptions are fulfilled '' .",
    "more generally , we recall the following definition from @xcite :    we will say that our _ smooth convexity assumptions _ are fulfilled if :    * @xmath8 denotes an @xmath7-dimensional ( @xmath97 ) smooth complete riemannian manifold or @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",

    "contrary to previous approaches , which could only deduce isoperimetric information from functional inequalities with a @xmath111 term with @xmath64 ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , it was shown in @xcite how to handle arbitrary @xmath112 . in the case of @xmath70 poincar inequalities , an easy reduction step in fact enables one to handle arbitrary @xmath113 . in this work ,",
    "we show how to deduce isoperimetric inequalities from very general orlicz - sobolev inequalities in the entire range @xmath113 .",
    "the easier case of @xmath114 is handled in section [ sec : semi - group ] , by generalizing our argument for @xmath70 poincar inequalities from @xcite .",
    "extending our results to the case @xmath113 ( which is very important for applications ) requires additional work , to which end we employ the notion of _ capacity_. capacity inequalities are certain functional formulations of isoperimetric inequalities , which were introduced around 1960 by mazya @xcite , federer and fleming @xcite , and used by bobkov and houdr in @xcite .",
    "mazya s notion of @xmath0-capacity for @xmath64 has recently been extended to the metric probability space setting by barthe , cattiaux and roberto in @xcite ( after being introduced in @xcite ) , where it was used to deduce isoperimetric inequalities , and has subsequently appeared in other works as well ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we recall the appropriate definitions in section [ sec : capacities ] , and show that @xmath0-capacity inequalities are equivalent in full generality to an appropriate weak - type variant of these orlicz - sobolev inequalities ( in the same sense that @xmath115 is the weak - type @xmath116 quasi - norm ) .",
    "we also give a very general condition for capacity inequalities to be equivalent to the usual ( non - weak ) orlicz - sobolev inequalities , which we require for the sequel .",
    "this extends a more restrictive condition ( and partly implicit ) obtained for @xmath64 in @xcite , following a similar condition for general @xmath0 in @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec : general ] we use capacities to extend our results to the whole range @xmath113 .",
    "we also demonstrate that our estimates are sharp , by showing that the isoperimetric inequalities we obtain are in fact equivalent ( up to universal constants ) to the functional inequalities used to derive them . to give a taste of the type of results we obtain , we state the following theorem ( see theorem [ thm : orlicz - summary ] for more details and a slightly stronger version ) :    [ thm : intro - orlicz ] let @xmath117 and let @xmath67 denote a young function , so that : @xmath118 then under our convexity assumptions , the following statements are equivalent :    1 .",

    "the advantage of these inequalities compared to the orlicz - sobolev inequalities lies in the fact that they admit tensorization . to further demonstrate the usefulness of the framework we develop , we easily deduce in section [ sec : tensorization ] as a by - product of our methods the dimension - free tensorization results of @xcite .",
    "in fact , we prove the following natural extension of these results . by the central - limit theorem , one can not expect a dimension - free result for isoperimetric profiles which are better than the one for the gaussian measure ( and even in this case some badly behaved examples due to franck barthe are known @xcite ) , so some condition needs to be imposed ( we refer to section [ sec : tensorization ] for more details ) :    [ thm : intro - tensorization ] let @xmath137 \\rightarrow { \\mathbb{r}}_+$ ] denote an arbitrary continuous concave function vanishing at @xmath138 and symmetric about the point @xmath24 .",

    "consequently , we can define for any @xmath735 $ ] the following ( bounded ) linear operator @xmath750 on @xmath751 : @xmath752 in fact , as in @xcite , it should be possible to show that @xmath740 is a continuous markov process , that @xmath750 is a strongly continuous semi - group associated to it , and that the associated dirichlet form is exactly given by : @xmath753    however , we will not require all this information .",
    "we will only use the weak convergence ( through a subsequence ) of the processes @xmath754 , defined on the 2-point set @xmath755 , to @xmath756 .",
    "we provide an elementary argument to deduce the tightness of this sequence ( from which the former statement follows by prokhorov s theorem ) .",
    "fixing a point @xmath701 , since the process @xmath736 is stationary : @xmath757 so it remains to show that : @xmath758 which is easily seen to hold , since this holds for the ( probability ) measure @xmath5 , and @xmath158 converge to @xmath5 in total - variation .",
    "we conclude that by passing to a subsequence , we may assume that @xmath754 converges weakly to @xmath756 . in other words , for any @xmath759 continuous and bounded on @xmath11 : @xmath760 or equivalently : @xmath761 where @xmath750 is the linear operator defined in ( [ eq : pt - def ] ) .",
    "clearly , this also extends to hold for all @xmath762 and @xmath763 .    using ( [ eq : pt - approx ] )",
    ", we can now transfer the known estimates ( [ eq : l_q - bound ] ) and corollary [ cor : ledoux ] on the semi - groups @xmath734 to the operators @xmath750 .",
    "indeed , given a bounded and smooth function @xmath57 on @xmath6 , we need to show that : @xmath764 and that : @xmath765 \\;\\;\\ ; { \\left\\vert{\\left\\vert\\nabla p_t f\\right\\vert}\\right\\vert}_{l_q(\\mu ) } \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 t } } { \\left\\vertf\\right\\vert}_{l_q(\\mu ) } ~,\\ ] ] using the same estimates ( [ eq : pt-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : pt-2 ] ) for @xmath734 and @xmath158 replacing @xmath750 and @xmath5 , respectively ( the latter are known to be true as described in section [ sec : semi - group ] , after approximating @xmath57 with functions in @xmath766 ) .",
    "note that we interpret the second estimate ( [ eq : pt-2 ] ) regarding @xmath767 in the sense of distributions as described below , since this is all that is needed for the applications of section [ sec : semi - group ] .",
    "writing : @xmath768 the estimate ( [ eq : pt-1 ] ) immediately follows from the same estimate for @xmath734 and @xmath158 and the weak convergence ( [ eq : pt - approx ] ) .",
    "the estimate ( [ eq : pt-2 ] ) is harder to handle , since it involves the distributional gradient of @xmath769 . setting @xmath522",
    ", we interpret : @xmath770 and @xmath771 is interpreted in the distributional sense ( using integration by parts ) .",
    "let @xmath52 denote such a vector field as above .",
    "since @xmath158 converges to @xmath5 it total - variation , it remains to show the first equality in : @xmath772 let us write : @xmath773 since @xmath774 for all @xmath775 , the convergence of @xmath158 to @xmath5 in total - variation implies that the second term converges to 0 as @xmath776 . to handle the first term",
    ", we intergrate by parts : @xmath777 it follows from lemma [ lem : psi - ae ] and remark [ rem : psi - ae ] that @xmath778 is a bounded function .",
    "this implies that the first term converges to 0 by @xmath779 , and since @xmath780 , the convergence of @xmath158 to @xmath5 in total - variation implies that the second term converges to 0 as well .",
    "we conclude that the estimates ( [ eq : pt-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : pt-2 ] ) hold for the linear operators @xmath750 defined using the limiting process @xmath740 , and we may use these operators in place of the diffusion semi - group in the relevant parts of the proof of theorem [ thm : orlicz-12 ] ( and consequently theorems [ thm : orlicz-12-strong ] , [ thm : orlicz - summary ] and [ thm : cap - iso ] ) , so that the conclusion of these theorems remains valid for @xmath5 as above .",
