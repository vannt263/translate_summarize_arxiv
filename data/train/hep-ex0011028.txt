    "the silicon vertex detector ( svd ) of the belle experiment  [ 1 ] at the kekb accelerator  [ 2 ] has been built to provide vertex information from precision measurements of charged tracks in the vicinity of the interaction point . because the kekb is an asymmetric @xmath1 collider with 8  gev @xmath2 and 3.5  gev @xmath3 beams , a pair of @xmath0 and @xmath4 mesons , produced nearly at rest at the center of mass system ( cms ) , is boosted along the @xmath2 beam direction with a lorentz boost factor of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , in designing the svd a special emphasis is placed on the precise measurement of the @xmath6 ( boost direction ) coordinate .",
    "the typical separation between @xmath0 and @xmath4 decays at the kekb is @xmath7 m and we find , based on the simulation , the @xmath6 resolution of @xmath8 m in @xmath0 meson decay vertex measurement is sufficient to detect a possible asymmetry in the proper time interval distribution for decays of @xmath9 pairs .",
    "this asymmetry signals @xmath10-violation in the @xmath0 meson system when one of the neutral @xmath0 mesons decays to a @xmath10 eigenstate .",
    "the svd consists of three concentric cylindrical layers of silicon sensors with two orthogonal - coordinate readouts .",
    "the vertex resolution for low momentum tracks is dominated by multiple scattering in a material before the svd plus the first svd layer .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] displays the geometrical layout of the svd .",
    "the radii of the three layers are @xmath11  mm , @xmath12  mm and @xmath13  mm .",
    "the svd covers the polar angle range of @xmath14 corresponding to @xmath15 of the solid angle in the cms .",
    "there installed is a @xmath16  mm - radius beryllium beampipe with two @xmath17  mm - thick walls allowing helium gas flow to cool the beampipe .",
    "a 20  @xmath18 m gold foil is glued on the inner concentric cover consisting of carbon - carbon material to protect the svd from soft xrays produced in the beampine .",
    "the material before the first svd layer amounts to @xmath19 of 1 radiation length .",
    "the first layer is formed from 8 `` ladders '' , each of which contains two double - sided silicon strip detectors ( dssds ) which are read out separately .",
    "the second layer is formed from 10 ladders , each containing 3 dssds .",
    "two of 3 dssds are connected to make a single two - sensor unit , in which p - strips on one dssd are wire - bonded to n - strips on the other dssd to minimize a noise in a channel .",
    "the third layer is formed from 14 ladders , each containing 2 two - sensor units .",
    "a full ladder consists of dssds , aluminum nitride hybrids at each end , glued with an aluminum nitride heat sink containing two heat pipes and cfrp reinforced boron nitride ribs glued across dssds and the heat sink , as shown in fig .",
    "the dssd , hpk s6936 , was originally fabricated for the delphi vertex detector by hamamatsu photonics .",
    "it has an active area of @xmath20 with a thickness of @xmath21 .",
    "the strip pitch for a p(n)-side is @xmath22 m and the readout pitch is @xmath23 m .",
    "this dssd contains integrated coupling capacitors and , therefore , the strips are ac - coupled to preamplifiers .",
    "it utilizes a double metal structure to read out n - strips .",
    "the total number of readout channels of the svd is 81920 .",
    "a bias voltage of 75v is supplied on n - side .",
    "each hybrid is made by gluing two identical aluminum nitride boards , each containing five 128-channel va1 chips  [ 3 ] providing 640 readout channels per board .",
    "the va1 chip fabricated by 1.2  @xmath18 m feature size process contains preamplifiers , shapers and track - and - hold circuits that capture the analog pulse - height information of each channel .",
    "the peaking time of the shaper is set to @xmath24s to match the trigger latency .",
    "when the system switched from track- to hold - mode the stored analog information for each channel is sequentially routed via an on - chip analog multiplexor to a system of fast analog - to - digital converters ( fadcs )  [ 4 ] .",
    "event buffering and zero data suppression are performed using motorola digital signal processors ( dsps ) in the fadc module .",
    "the @xmath25 distributions of minimum ionizing particles for p - side and n - side , together with the correlation between signals from two sides are shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath25 values are calculated by summing all signals ( above threshold ) which belong to the same track and by normalizing to the same track length ( i.e. , 300  @xmath18 m ) .",
    "the signal peaks at @xmath26 and @xmath27 for p - side and n - side , respectively , while the electronics noise is found to be @xmath28 for p - side channels , @xmath29 for n - side channel and @xmath30 for p - n combined channels in which a p - strip and an n - strip are connected . therefore , signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio is well above 10 .",
    "the strip yield for each layer is found to be @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 for 1st , 2nd and 3rd layers , respectively .",
    "the loss of strips includes failure of hybrids and a few failed coupling capacitors . since the installation in august 1999",
    ", the svd has been functioning stably .",
    "the occupancy of the svd is @xmath34 at the luminosity of @xmath35 . for hadronic events we find @xmath36 of tracks reconstructed by the central drift chamber ( cdc )",
    "have corresponding hits in the svd .",

    "@xmath37 $ ] , @xmath38 , @xmath39 . ]",
    "compared with the values for the perfect alignment , predicted by monte carlo simulation .",
    "we note that the @xmath40 resolutions are mostly determined by the svd internal alignment performance , while the @xmath41 resolutions depend on the cdc track resolutions as well .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows impact parameter resolutions , @xmath42 , for @xmath43 and @xmath6 directions measured using cosmic rays , bhabha events and @xmath44 processes .",
    "we obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are momentum in @xmath48 and velocity divided by @xmath49 of the particle , and @xmath50 is the polar angle from the beam axis . the resolution in a measurement of the distance between two @xmath6 vertices of leptons originating from a @xmath51 particle",
    "can also infer the resolution of the @xmath6 coordinate measurement . here",
    ", each @xmath6 vertex is calculated by finding an intersection between a lepton track and the beam axis .",
    "we find @xmath52 , while monte carlo predicts @xmath53 .",
    "in order to demonstrate the overall performance of the svd , we present preliminary results of @xmath54 and @xmath0 meson lifetime measurements based on the first @xmath55 data collected during the initial data taking period  [ 5 ] .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath56 mesons in the decay mode @xmath57 .",
    "charged tracks forming a @xmath56 candidate are required to be well - reconstructed in the tracking system and to originate from a common vertex .",
    "kaons are positively identified in the particle i d system  [ 6 ] . in order to avoid bias due to @xmath0 meson lifetime ,",
    "@xmath56 mesons originating from @xmath0 mesons are removed by requiring @xmath56 mesons have a minimum momentum of @xmath58 in the @xmath59 rest frame .",
    "figure  [ fig : d0mass_fig](a ) shows the invariant mass distribution of @xmath60 decays . by fitting the distribution with a gaussian for the signal plus a linear function for the background",
    ", we find the width of the signal distribution to be @xmath61 and the number of signal events to be @xmath62 .",
    "the background fraction is calculated from the same fit and is about @xmath63 under a signal peak ( the region within @xmath64 ) .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : d0mass_fig](b ) the lifetime of the charmed meson is computed from the flight distance between the reconstructed @xmath56 vertex and the interaction point(ip ) determined for each kekb beam fill .",
    "the profile of the ip is known to have , from the machine optics and the beam size monitoring information , @xmath65 along the beam direction @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , and @xmath68 in the direction perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "the @xmath56 flight length is measured in the @xmath69 plane to take advantage of the small ip size in the plane .",
    "the projected decay length @xmath70 of the @xmath56 meson is calculated from the @xmath56 momentum @xmath71 , the @xmath56 decay vertex @xmath72 , and the @xmath56 production point @xmath73 reconstructed by extrapolating the @xmath56 momentum back to the ip profile : @xmath74 .",
    "the proper time @xmath75 is , then , calculated using the @xmath56 mass , @xmath76 , as @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath56 meson lifetime is extracted from the proper - time distribution with an unbinned maximum likelihood method .",
    "the detector resolution is mostly described by a single gaussian with a small correction for events which might have undergone a hard multiple coulomb scattering and/or have wrong cdc - svd hit associations in the track reconstruction program .",
    "figure  [ fig : d0fit ] shows the fit to the proper time distribution .",
    "the preliminary result for the lifetime of @xmath56 meson is @xmath78 where the error includes only the statistical error .",
    "this is in good agreement with the pdg value of @xmath79  fs .",
    "the @xmath0 meson lifetime is extracted from the measurement of the separation of @xmath0 and @xmath80 decays , @xmath81 , in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "we first reconstruct @xmath82 , where @xmath83 decays to @xmath84 followed by either one of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 decays .",
    "the decay vertex of @xmath88 is determined using the reconstructed @xmath89 momentum and the lepton @xmath90 track .",
    "we , then , determine the @xmath91 decay vertex requiring all the remaining tracks in the same event , except for tracks originating from @xmath92 decays and tracks with large impact parameters , form a common vertex .",
    "figure  [ brecon](a ) illustrates the vertex reconstruction of @xmath93 events .",
    "the distribution of @xmath81 with the fit result is shown in fig .",
    "[ brecon](b ) .",
    "the fitted function consists of the expected @xmath81 distribution smeared with the detector resolution .",
    "we obtain the result of @xmath94  ps , while the resolution in @xmath81 is found to be @xmath95 .",
    "the result is consistent with the pdg value of @xmath96  ps .",
    "the current svd readout chips have limited radiation tolerance .",
    "the @xmath97-technology va1 chip is not based on a radiation - hard technology and stops functioning after a @xmath98-ray dose of @xmath99  krad . with",
    "the current radiation level observed at the kekb , this corresponds to an integrated luminosity of @xmath100 .",
    "we have been developing a frontend ic which stands radiation dose of more than 1mrad by taking advantage of the thinner gate - oxide layers used in sub - micron cmos processes . because the threshold shift in a mos transition scales as the square of the thickness of the gate oxide layer , which in turn is proportional to the fet channel width or equivalently to the feature size of the process being used , one expects the radiation tolerance of the ic scales as the inverse square of the feature size .",
    "one expects that a @xmath101 m process ic is four times more radiation - tolerant than a @xmath24 m process ic .",
    "we have fabricated two versions of va1 chips , one with ams @xmath102 m technology and the other with ams @xmath103 m  [ 7 ] .",
    "figure  [ va08](a ) shows gain versus radiation dose for ams @xmath102 m technology va1 .",
    "the gain decrease rate is found to be @xmath104/krad .",
    "figure  [ va08](b ) shows the equivalent noise count versus radiation dose .",
    "based on these measurements we conclude the @xmath102 m va1 chips are radiation tolerant up to @xmath105mrad .",
    "the new svd built with these va1 chips is scheduled to be installed in summer 2000 .",
    "the ams @xmath103 m va1 exhibits the excellent radiation hardness as shown in fig .",
    "[ va035 ] .",
    "it is tolerant up to 20  mrad .",

    "preliminary measurements of lifetimes of @xmath56 and @xmath88 mesons show it is performing as designed .",
