    "the disk mass @xmath0 , together with disk length - scale @xmath1 , is the main physical property of the baryonic component of normal spiral galaxies . in the current framework of galaxy formation theory , in an halo of mass @xmath2",
    ", the present day value of @xmath3 indicates the efficiency with which the stellar formation process acted in proto - spirals on the large primordial reservoir of @xmath4 hi material .",
    "it also bears the imprint of the physical processes ( supernovae feedback , cooling , previrialization ) that have prevented the latter in entirely transforming into a stellar disk ( see shankar et al .",
    "the quantity @xmath5 is proportional to the angular momentum per unit mass of the disk matter , very likely the same value of that of the dark particles ( e.g. tonini et al , 2006 ) and it is linked to the tidal torques that dark halo experienced from neighbors at their turnarounds .",
    "finally , we should recall that @xmath6 is a measure of the central stellar surface density .",
    "the mass modelling of the rotation curves ( hereafter rcs ) is a robust and reliable method ( hereafter the kinematical method _ kin _ ) to derive the disk mass ( e.g. tonini & salucci , 2004 ) ) . for illustrative purposes we recall that",
    ", inside one disk length - scale the rc s almost entirely match the distribution of the stellar component , a perfect match between gravitating mass and luminous mass is reached by adding just a very small dark matter component ( e.g. persic , salucci , stel 1996 , salucci & persic , 1999 ) .",
    "this observational evidence is well understood within the current galaxy formation scenario .",
    "disks form from baryons that , while infalling in dm potential wells , unlike the dm component , radiate , lose kinetic energy and contract : their final configuration saturates the gravitational field of the inner regions of galaxies .    a second independent way , pioneered by tinsley ( 1981 ) ( hereafter the spectro - photometric method _ pho _ ) , by fitting a galaxy broadband sed with stellar population models obtains the disk mass as the resulting best - fit parameter .    in salucci et al . 1991",
    "we find the first study in which the combination of these two independent methods was applied to a sample of 38 spirals with available kinematics and photometry ; disk masses were estimated from the @xmath7 colors and then compared with the values obtained by modelling their rotation curves .",
    "similarly , ratnam and salucci , ( 2000 ) used high - spatial resolution ( @xmath8 100 pc ) rotation curves of 30 spirals in order to derive the mass distribution in their innermost kpc .",
    "they found that , in this region the luminous matter completely accounts for the gravitational potential , so that the kinematics provides a very precise value for the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "these values resulted in a good agreement with that obtained from @xmath9 colors by applying the predictions of population synthesis models .",
    "a similar result has been found for a small number of `` laboratory '' barred spirals ( weiner et al , 2001 ; perez , 2004 )    a substantial improvement of the _ pho _ method has come from bell and de jong , 2001 ; they devised spiral galaxy evolution models that yielded the stellar m / l ratios dependence on different colors for integrated stellar populations .",
    "these results were tested against the `` maximum disk '' stellar m / l ratios of a sample of spiral galaxies .    in a different approach the determination of disk masses",
    "was directly implemented in the rc mass modelling itself .",
    "kassin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) studied a sample of 34 bright spiral galaxies whose disk masses were obtained by _",
    "colors , so that the mass model had one less free parameter .",
    "however , this promising procedure requires the mass estimate to be very accurate ; since an error on the assumed value @xmath10 , with respect to the actual value @xmath11 , fatally flaws the entire mass modelling ( e.g. tonini and salucci , 2006 ) .",
    "it is useful now to give a simplified proof of this .",
    "let us set @xmath12 , the halo velocity contribution to the circular velocity around @xmath13 , the radius where the disk contribution to the circular velocity ( of true value @xmath14 ) has a radial maximum . by setting @xmath15 the ( observed ) rc slope at @xmath13",
    ", we have : @xmath16 that shows even quite small errors in the _ pho _ estimate of @xmath11 may trigger very large errors in derived dm halo profiles .",
    "advantages and disadvantages are present in both _",
    "pho _ and _ kin _ methods , though , remarkably , they are almost orthogonal .",
    "the photometric method relies on the not trivial caveat that , given a sed there is an unique stellar mass which explains it .",
    "moreover , it takes a number of assumptions on the stellar populations of spirals , it depends on the estimate of the galaxy distance as @xmath17 ( uncertain to some level for local objects ) .",
    "moreover , it carries theoretical uncertainties ( in log @xmath0 ) up to 0.3 dex .",
    "the kinematical method may suffer from the uncertainty on the actual distribution of dm in galaxies , depends on the disk inclination angle as @xmath18 and therefore is uncertain for low inclination galaxies , and it depends on the estimate of the galaxy distance as @xmath19 .",
    "the main advantages of the photometric method are that it makes no assumption on the mass distribution and it requires only a limited observational effort ; the main advantage of the kinematical method is that the disk mass can be obtained straightforwardly from model independent observables and within an uncertainty of @xmath20 : infact @xmath21 , where @xmath22 can be estimated from the slope of the rc inside @xmath23 , within 0.1 dex uncertainty ( persic and salucci , 1990a , b ) , while @xmath1 is generally known within a 0.07 dex uncertainty .",
    "combination of the two methods is particularly useful in dark matter dominated dwarfs where the _ kin _ method fails since the stellar disk is largely non self - gravitating at any radius and in galaxies with large uncertainties in the distances that propagate themselves onto the _ pho _ estimates .",
    "the aim of this paper is to measure the disk masses of a sample of 18 spirals with both methods and to compare them .",
    "we use combined sdss and 2mass photometry covering the _ ugrizjhk _ bands to fit each galaxy s sed to a broad range of stellar population models with varying star formation history , age , dust content , and burst fraction . with respect to previous _",
    "pho _ estimates the present one takes advantage of measurements in 8 bands ranging from the u to the k. high quality rc s will provide the kinematical data , whose analysis will benefit from the results of recent work .    comparing , for a fair sample of galaxies , the disk mass estimates obtained with the two different methods is worthwile for the following reasons : firstly , the average of the two estimates will give a very reliable measure of the stellar disk mass for objects of different luminosities , thus providing an unprecedentedly accurate stellar mass vs light relationship .",
    "secondly , it allows for an investigation of the assumptions taken by each of the two methods , providing additional information on the structure and evolution of galaxies .",
    "finally , it will indicate the still poorly known uncertainties of the _ pho _ estimates of the disk mass , setting the situation in which they can be used in mass modelling .",
    "the sample consists of 18 galaxies ( see fig 1 for their images ) . among them",
    "16 galaxies are late - type spirals taken from courteau ( 1997 ) and vogt ( 2004 ) .",
    "the data analysis technique applied to these rotation curves has been described in yegorova et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ; in order to also include some early type objects we decided to add ugc4119 and ugc6351 whose data were obtained in asiago observatory with the 182 cm copernico telescope in january 2006 .",
    "the sample includes all the sdss local spirals with 8 band measurements ( i.e. a good coverage of the entire sed ) necessary for the highest precision estimate of the `` photometric '' mass and with smooth , symmetric , regular , high resolution ( @xmath24 10 independent data inside two disk length - scales ) rotation curves .",
    "some of the latter requirements are implemented to make us sure that the selected rc s are not affected by non - axisymmetric features , such as bars and spiral structure that , in any case , affect the rc slopes rather than the rc amplitudes ( that plays the major role in the _ kin _ estimates ) .",
    "finally , the values of @xmath1 are taken from courteau ( 1997 ) and vogt ( 2004 ) , including their inclination angles @xmath25 , that being relatively highly inclined @xmath26 , do not affect their _ kin _ estimates .",
    "notice that in the literature _ kin _ disk masses have been obtained for many other objects that , unfortunately , do not have the set of photometric data sufficient for the specific aim of this work .",
    "0.1 cm    the plan of this work is the following : in section 2 we will describe the kinematical method , in section 3 the spectro - photometric method , the resulting mass and mass - to - light ratio will be shown in section 4 and 5 , and a discussion is presented in section 6 .",
    "in spirals the stellar component is represented by a freeman disk ( freeman 1970 ) of surface density : @xmath27 that contributes to the circular velocity @xmath28 as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the modified bessel functions computed at @xmath33 .",
    "a bulge of mass @xmath34 , @xmath35 concentrated inside @xmath36 is often present .",
    "the amplitude and the profile of the rcs for @xmath37 is influenced by the central bulge in a negligible way for @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , in the rc mass modelling , even if we neglect a quite significant stellar bulge component ( @xmath39 ) , we obtain a disk mass value higher than the actual one , but matching that of the total stellar mass @xmath40 ( persic , salucci , ashman , 1993 ) , therefore , providing a suitable mass to be compared with the total galaxy luminosity and with the spectro - photometric mass estimate .",

    "the above velocity profile implies a density profile with an inner flat velocity core of size @xmath46 , a constant central density and an outer @xmath47 decline , which , however is never reached in our rcs since generally they do not extend beyond @xmath48 .",
    "let us highlight that in the region in which most of the baryons lie and where we will measure the disk mass , eq(2b ) can approximate , with proper values of the free parameters , a number of different halo distributions , including the nfw , the burkert and the pseudo - isothermal ones .",
    "obviously , for @xmath49 , @xmath50 needs not to be represented by eq(2b ) .",
    "the kinematical estimate of the disk mass @xmath51 is obtained by fitting the observed rotation velocities @xmath28 to the model velocity curve @xmath52 : @xmath53 the model parameters , including the disk mass @xmath54 , are obtained by minimizing the usual quantity ( data - model)@xmath55 .",
    "an advantage of this method emerges by noticing that @xmath54 are found very similar to the disk masses computed by means of the approach discussed above : a ) by means of the equation : @xmath56 we determine the inner baryon dominance region ( salucci and persic 1999 ) , i.e. the region inside which the slope of the disk contribution to the circular velocity coincides ( within the observational errors ) with the slope of the latter ; b ) we fit the rc s of this region with only the disk contribution . since in most cases this region extend out to @xmath1 , we can write @xmath57 : it is obvious that the `` theoretical '' uncertainties on the kinematical estimates of the disk masses are modest when the rcs show an inner region which is well reproduced by the stellar component alone .",
    "the rc fits are excellent , as those obtained in ratnam & salucci ( 2000 ) and salucci et al ( 2000 ) , showing that within the inner parts of spirals , light traces the dynamical mass .",
    "thus , the inner rc of spirals are reproduced by just a stellar disk with a suitable choice of its mass - to - light ratio . in this way",
    "we get the value @xmath54 for the disk mass and the formal uncertainty @xmath58 on @xmath59 , found to range between 0.10 and 0.20 dex , and mostly due to the ( small but non zero ) observational error in the rcs and in the estimate of @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting values for the disk masses are given in table 1 .",
    "-0.4 cm    -0.7 cm    -0.2 cm [ md2 ]    a further support for the reliability of the above estimates emerges by the fact that the values of @xmath60 are found to be within 0.1 dex of those computed by means of the following approach : a ) with the equation : @xmath56 we determine the inner baryon dominance region ( salucci and persic 1999 ) , i.e. the region inside which the slope of the disk contribution to the circular velocity coincides ( within the observational errors ) with the slope of the latter ; b ) we fit the rc s of this region with only the disk contribution .",
    "then , it is very likely that the _ kin _ method is not significantly affected by model dependent uncertainties .",
    "we infer stellar masses from multi - color photometry following drory , bender , & hopp ( 2004 ) .",
    "we compare multi - color photometry to a grid of stellar population synthesis models covering a wide range in star formation histories ( sfhs ) , ages , burst fractions , and dust extinctions .",
    "we use photometric data in the ugriz bands from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 4 , augmented with jhk data from the 2 micron all sky survey .",
    "we perform matched - aperture photometry with apertures defined in the sdss r - band image to obtain integrated galaxy colors to the petrosian radius .",
    "photometric errors are 0.03 - 0.08 in j , h , and k , respectively , @xmath61  0.1  mag in the u band , and @xmath61  0.01  mag in the g , r , i , and z bands . just as a reference of the galaxy luminosities",
    ", we give in table 2 their absolute b - band magnitudes .",
    "our stellar population model grid is based on the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) stellar population synthesis package .",
    "we also use an updated version of these models ( g. bruzual , private communication ) .",
    "we parameterize the possible sfhs by a two - component model : a main component with a smooth analytically described sfh , and , superimposed , a short recent burst of star formation .",
    "the main component has a star formation rate of the form @xmath62 , with @xmath63 $ ]  gyr and a metallicity of @xmath64 } < 0.3 $ ] .",
    "the age , @xmath65 , is allowed to vary between 0.5  gyr and the age of the universe ( 14  gyr ) .",
    "we superimpose a burst of star formation , modelled as a constant star formation rate episode of solar metallicity and of 100  myr duration .",
    "we restrict the burst fraction , @xmath66 , to the range @xmath67 in mass ( higher values of @xmath66 are degenerate and unnecessary since this case is covered by models with a young main component ) .",
    "we adopt a chabrier ( 2003 ) initial mass function for both components . the main component and the burst",
    "are allowed to independently exhibit a variable amount of extinction by dust .",
    "this takes into account the fact that young stars are found in dusty environments and that the starlight from the galaxy as a whole may be reddened by a ( geometry dependent ) different amount .",
    "we compute the full likelihood distribution on a grid in this 6-dimensional parameter space ( @xmath68 } , t , a_v^1 , \\beta , a_v^2 $ ] ) , the likelihood of each model being @xmath69 . in each object , we compute the likelihood distribution of the stellar mass - to - light ratios that will give the best estimated value @xmath70 , by weighting the mass - to - light ratio relative to a spectro - photometric model and marginalizing it over all stellar population parameters . the uncertainty in the derived @xmath70 , and hence in stellar mass , is obtained from the width of this distribution and given in table 2 .",
    "while estimates of stellar population parameters such as the mean age , the star formation history , the burst fraction , and the dust content are subject to degeneracies and often are poorly constrained by the models , the value of the stellar disk mass obtained by marginalizing over the stellar population parameters is a lot more robust . on average @xmath71 , the width of the distribution of the likelihood of @xmath70 , at @xmath72 confidence level is between @xmath73 and @xmath74  dex .",
    "the uncertainty in the estimated stellar mass is mostly `` theoretical '' ; it has a weak dependence on the stellar mass itself ( in that it increases with lower @xmath75 photometry ) and much of the variation of the errors is in spectral type : early - type galaxies have more tightly constrained masses than late types because their star formation histories are tightly constrained while the ones of late - type galaxies are less well constrained due to degeneracies with age and recent burst fractions .",
    "this dependence of the uncertainties on spectral type is the dominant source of uncertainty in the photometric mass of our sample .",
    "the contribution to the uncertainty due to photometric errors is negligible in our relatively high @xmath75 photometry , however , about 20% of the uncertaity is due to errors in the determination of the extrapolated total magnitudes and colors .",
    "note that masses computed with the bc07 models are lower by 0.1 to 0.15  dex compared to the ones using the bc03 models .",
    "this is due to the higher red and infrared luminosities of intermediate age ( @xmath61  0.8 - 2  gyr ) stellar populations in the newer models which owing to a larger contribution of post - agb stars in the newer models .",
    "this particularly affects our sample of mostly relatively late type spiral galaxies with extended star formation histories and significant recent star formation .",
    "the two different estimates of the disk masses are shown in figure 3 .",
    "a correlation yields :    @xmath76 with a r.m.s of 0.23 dex . by considering the errors on the separate determination of @xmath54 and on @xmath10 the slope and zero - point of the relation are consistent respectively with 1 and 0 . from fig .",
    "( 3 ) and eq .",
    "( 4 ) it is evident that the two estimates are _ statistically _ equivalent , i.e. _ on average _ : @xmath77 . within a small scatter",
    "both mass estimates are suitable measures of the true disk ( stellar ) mass . on an individual basis",
    ", however , the match can be less impressive given the presence of outliers up to 0.5 dex off the relationship .",
    "eq(4 ) , showing that the value of the slope of relationship is near to unity , implies that the slope of any relation between a quantity @xmath78 and the disk mass @xmath11 , given by @xmath79 does not change when we substitute the unknown @xmath11 values with the available @xmath10 ones .",
    "moreover , considering that the estimated uncertainty on @xmath80 is about 0.25 dex ( a quantity much lesser than its variation among spirals ) , we can substitute @xmath11 in the same way , in order to derive quantities such as the disc mass function , the halo - to - disc mass ratio or in statistical investigations of the tully fisher .    -0.3",
    "biases , observational errors and systematics of the two determinations are independent , therefore we can define as an accurate measure of the disk mass @xmath0 as the log average of the two different estimates : @xmath81    from this we compute the spiral mass - to - light ratio . ( ab magnitudes in the johnson filters ) .",
    "we find that this quantity , in spirals , ranges over 1.2 dex in the b band and 0.7 dex in the i band and , not unexpectedly , depends on the galaxy broad - band color .",
    "in fact , we find the relation ( see fig .",
    "4 )    @xmath82 that , within the very small r.m.s of about 0.05 dex , reflects the fact that older stellar populations are redder and have higher mass - to - light ratios .",
    "similarly , we get    @xmath83 ( about r.m.s .",
    "= 0.07 dex )    the agreement between the two determinations allows us to establish , from the i luminosity and b - i broad band colors , a solid _ statistical _ estimate of the stellar mass of spirals ( i.e. well within an uncertainty of 0.1 dex ) , that may be reduces further reduced when the whole sed is considered .",
    "although not derivable from basic stellar physics as the previous ones , we find that the mass to light ratio correlates with stellar mass ( or luminosity ) see fig 4 , @xmath84 within a r.m.s .",
    "of 0.12 dex and    @xmath85 within a r.m.s . of about 0.15 dex",
    "in this paper we find that the two main methods to measure the disk masses in spirals , namely the sed and the rc fitting are both robust , solid and consistent . in an illustrative way , in bulge - less systems ,",
    "already the stellar disk mass estimates @xmath86and @xmath87 that we obtain from a simplified implementations of the two methods are equivalent and reliable .",
    "on the other hand , the agreement between the two methods implies a support for a ) the existence of a inner baryon dominated region , inside which the stellar disk saturates the gravitational potential overwhelming that of the dm halo b ) the assumed imf and sfr histories : significantly different choices would lead to @xmath88 .",
    "our results confirm in a substantial way the work by bell and de jong ( 2001 ) : they found within reasonable assumptions , that the stellar population models predict a strong correlation between a colour of a stellar population and its stellar m / l ratio ; moreover , it emerged that the slope of such relationship is quite insensitive to the star formation histories and the mean ages of galaxies . for the present sample",
    "we find ( see figure 3 ) statistically relevant mass - to - light vs color relationships , with values of their slopes ( @xmath892.1 and @xmath890.54 in the b and i band respectively ) in good agreement with those of bell and de jong ( 2001 ) ( @xmath891.8 and @xmath890.6 ) . in addition , from the compatibility of the stellar population models with the tully - fisher relation , @xmath90 , bell and de jong claimed `` maximun disk '' mass distributions . in spite of the fact that the tf relation is strongly biased by the dm in a luminosity and radial dependent way ( yegorova et al , 2007 ) , our results support such view : if _ on average _ we assume the `` photometric '' values for the disk masses and we mass model the rc s , we obtain a dark - luminous mass decomposition very similar to the `` maximum disk '' one .    the derived values of the disk masses imply that spiral galaxies , unlike ellipticals , have a quite wide range in the mass - to - light ratios , i.e. almost a dex , reflecting an intrinsic spread in the ages of their average stellar populations , confirmed by their spread in colors . moreover , it is evident that spiral disks are significantly less massive than the elliptical spheroids of the same luminosity . for ellipticals",
    "we have : @xmath91 , @xmath92 ( e.g. borriello et al 2000 ) , with @xmath93 , while for spirals we have found ( in section 3 ) : @xmath94 with @xmath95 . in the luminosity range where ellipticals and spiral coexist ,",
    "spheroids are therefore more massive by an amount @xmath96 than disks of the same luminosity .",
    "finally , there is one case in which @xmath10 is too uncertain to substitute the disk mass @xmath11 value : the dm halo cusp - core controversy .",
    "in fact , if in the kinematical mass modelling of a rc we assume @xmath97 , we also introduce in this crucial constraint an error of a size ranging from @xmath98 dex to @xmath99 dex ; this triggers a serious uncertainty and a troublesome not - uniqueness in the rc s best fit solutions .",
    "one practical example is eso 287-g13 in gentile et al 2004 , according to the results of the present work the _ pho _ estimate of the i - band mass - to - light ratio of this object ranges between 0.6 and 2.3 . however , while the lowest value allows a stellar disk plus a gaseous disk and a nfw halo , the highest value , instead , leads the above model to be strongly inconsistent with the rc .",
    "after the results of this pilot study we can claim that , by measuring the disk mass for a reasonable number of objects ( n @xmath100 ) by means of _ both _ high quality kinematics and extended seds , it will be possible 1 ) to establish an accurate color vs disk mass relationships that , when applied to very large samples ( @xmath101 ) will give a reliable ( for a number of issues ) measure of the latter with much less observational effort than any other method 2 ) to use the agreement of the two different measures as an observational tool to investigate the sfh and the imf of spirals .    .columns",
