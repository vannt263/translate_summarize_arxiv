    "<S> introduction:_the presence of internal degrees of freedom in the quantum hall regime has often provided fertile ground for the emergence of new strongly correlated quantum liquid physics . </S>",

    "<S> graphene in particular , the nearly four - fold and eight - fold degenerate @xmath2 landau levels have recently been shown to give rise to interesting examples of ground states with competing orders  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a diverse toolkit of theoretical approaches that can be successfully applied to understand fractional quantum hall states has accumulated over the nearly three decades of research . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most widely employed frameworks is that of composite fermions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the success of the composite fermion picture stems in part from its simplicity , since it allows fractional quantum hall states of electrons to be viewed as integer quantum hall states of composite fermions . </S>",
    "<S> an important success of the composite fermion approach is that it provides explicit trial wavefunctions that accurately approximate the ground states computed using exact diagonalization for the jain sequence of filling fractions @xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the composite fermion picture can be generalized to account for a multicomponent hilbert space , and it has been argued that it correctly captures the incompressible ground states of 4-component systems with su(4 ) invariant coulomb interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a detailed test of composite fermion theory in the su(3 ) and su(4 ) cases has been absent .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we report on a striking deviation from the composite - fermion picture arising at filling fraction @xmath0 for three and four - component electrons residing in the @xmath4 landau level and interacting via the coulomb potential . </S>",
    "<S> this circumstance is relevant to the fractional quantum hall effect in graphene  @xcite , and also bilayer quantum wells  @xcite . employing exact diagonalization for the torus and sphere geometries </S>",
    "<S> we find that su(3 ) and su(4 ) singlets , in which electrons respectively occupy three and four components equally , have lower energy than the known single - component state and su(2 ) singlet  @xcite at the same filling factor . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we find that on the torus the ground state for @xmath5 electrons and @xmath6 flux quanta is a su(3 ) singlet , and that for @xmath7 and @xmath8 the ground state is a su(4 ) singlet . </S>",
    "<S> there are previous exact diagonalization studies of su(4 ) landau levels  @xcite , but to our knowledge there is no previous report of the states we describe below .    on the sphere a shift @xmath9 occurs in the finite - size relationship between flux quanta and electrons compared to the torus @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the shift is a quantum number that often distinguishes competing quantum hall states associated with the same filling factor . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , under space rotational invariance , any two states that differ in their shift can not be adiabatically connected and would thus belong to distinct quantum hall phases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our su(3 ) and su(4 ) singlets appear on the sphere at ( @xmath11 , @xmath12)=(7 , 6 ) and at ( @xmath11 , @xmath12)=(10 , 8) respectively , corresponding to a shift @xmath13 in both cases .    for two - component electrons </S>",
    "<S> the composite fermion picture allows two competing trial wavefunctions at @xmath0  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one is a fully spin polarized state that approximates the particle - hole conjugate of the @xmath14 laughlin state . </S>",
    "<S> the second is a su(2 ) spin singlet , constructed from the @xmath15 integer quantum hall ferromagnet by flux attachment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this state approximates the singlet ground state of the su(2 ) symmetric coulomb interaction  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our findings indicate that this expectation breaks down .    </S>",
    "<S> another way to construct multicomponent wavefunctions is to follow halperin s approach  @xcite in which one requires that the wavefunction vanishes with power @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) when pairs of particles in the same ( different ) component approach each other . </S>",
    "<S> a four - component halperin wavefunction arises naturally at @xmath0 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this state is not an exact singlet because it does not satisfy fock s cyclic condition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this alone does not rule out this wavefunction as a legitimate trial state , because one could still imagine it to be adiabatically connected to the exact singlet when exact su(4 ) symmetry is relaxed . </S>",
    "<S> however , this halperin wavefunction has a shift @xmath20 , which differs from the shift @xmath13 of the su(4 ) singlet discovered numerically . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the two states can not be adiabatically connected in a system with rotational invariance . </S>",
    "<S> for the three - component case there are no multi - component halperin wavefunctions at @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> a possible strategy to construct trial wavefunctions for the new singlet states , detailed in the supplemental material , starts from a su(@xmath1 ) singlet state @xmath21 at an integer filling @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 is the slater determinant state in which @xmath23fold degenerate lowest landau levels are fully occupied . </S>",
    "<S> su(3 ) and su(4 ) singlets with the desired filling @xmath0 and shift @xmath13 are then obtained by multiplying the slater determinant @xmath21 by appropriate jastrow - type factors . even within this rather general strategy , </S>",
