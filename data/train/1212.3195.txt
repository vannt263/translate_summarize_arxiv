    "the concept of multifractality in the context of finance has received much attention in the econophysics literature @xcite over the last two decades .",
    "many empirical studies have investigated financial data scaling behaviour @xcite and several models have been proposed to account for the observed multifractal features @xcite .",
    "multifractal behaviour has become a downright stylised fact of financial market data @xcite , being observed across several classes of assets : from daily stock prices to foreign exchange rates and composite indices @xcite .",
    "multifractality is also particularly appealing for modelling financial markets as it offers a simple behavioural interpretation : looking at the volatility at different time scales is a very natural way to assess the impact of heterogeneous agents in the market and therefore any measure of scaling behaviour can convey information about the efficiency of a given market @xcite . in this regard",
    "some authors have suggested , and confirmed through extensive empirical studies , that scaling exponents can be representative of the stage of development of a market @xcite . the same works have convincingly shown that , through a hierarchy of scaling exponents , it is possible to classify markets according to their degree of development with emerging markets exhibiting scaling exponents significantly larger than those observed in developed markets .",
    "let us recall that a process @xmath0 with stationary increments is called multifractal if the following scaling law is observed @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a constant and @xmath3 is a non - linear function of @xmath4 , called the scaling function .",
    "the departure of @xmath3 from linearity is what distinguishes multifractal processes from uni - scaling processes and the degree of non - linearity of the scaling function is accounted for by the _ intermittency coefficient _ , defined as @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "note that the last definition requires the scaling function to have a second derivative well defined in @xmath6 in order for the intermittency coefficient to be defined .",
    "( in practice , it is extremely difficult to estimate this coefficient from empirical measures . ) for multifractal processes , the scaling in equation ( @xmath7 ) holds for small @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is some larger scale called the _ integral scale _ @xcite .",
    "this means that if the integral scale of the process is not large enough compared to the resolution of the increments , although the scaling may in principle hold , the definition does nt hold any longer . in order to estimate the scaling function from real data one resorts to the scaling of the empirical moments @xmath11 where we denote @xmath12 the log - return at time @xmath13 and scale @xmath8 , with @xmath14 the asset price at time @xmath13 , @xmath15 the empirical scaling function and @xmath16 the length of the time series .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the empirically estimated @xmath15 is significant only for small values of @xmath4 and one therefore needs to be careful in interpreting the scaling beyond a certain @xmath4 . when the scaling ( [ scaling2 ] ) is observed , one defines the generalised hurst exponent @xmath17 ( ghe ) via @xmath18 the exponent @xmath17 is non - linear in @xmath4 for multi - scaling processes , whereas it reduces to a constant @xmath19 if the process is uni - scaling .",
    "the time evolution of the scaling function , measured via the ghe , can be useful to track time varying properties of the market .",
    "for this reason @xmath15 has also been studied dynamically via the time dependent ( or local ) hurst exponent @xcite . in a recent publication @xcite",
    "the authors have observed large fluctuations in multifractality measured via the generalised hurst exponent in empirical daily data across different stock sectors .",
    "specifically , the authors considered as a measure of multifractal behaviour the quantity @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the weighted generalized hurst exponent ( wghe ) @xcite .",
    "the weighting procedure incrementally damps effects from past return fluctuations .",
    "the dynamical evolution of @xmath22 ( which we shall label @xmath23 ) is useful to track changes in multifractality occurring over time .",
    "when facing the task of ascertaining the nature of dynamical fluctuations in these quantities , the subtle issue is being able to distinguish between spurious statistical fluctuations , which are due to the finiteness of the sample and noise , and true structural changes in the underlying multifractal process . in this paper",
    "we study the problem of validating dynamical fluctuations of the scaling functions , performing an empirical analysis of stock returns and comparing their properties with those of synthetic multifractal series . among all existing models we focus on the multifractal random walk ( mrw ) introduced by bacry _",
    "_ @xcite because of its parsimonious formulation and its success in the econophysics literature .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we review the main properties of the mrw and establish the connection with the generalised hurst exponent . in section [ sec3 ] , after introducing the statistical testing procedure , we report the main findings on the varying multifractality of empirical stock returns data . a summary and conclusive remarks are drawn in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "the multifractal random walk ( mrw ) @xcite can be viewed as a stochastic volatility model constructed by taking the limit for @xmath24 of the process @xmath25 with @xmath26 a gaussian white noise with variance @xmath27 and @xmath28 a stochastic volatility uncorrelated with @xmath29 . by taking @xmath30 as a stationary gaussian process",
    ", we have log - normal volatility components .",
    "what distinguishes the limit @xmath24 of @xmath31 from a brownian motion is the choice of the auto covariance structure of the process @xmath30 , which is chosen , according to cascade - like processes @xcite , as @xmath32 the logarithmic decay with lag @xmath33 of the auto covariance creates long memory in the process .",
    "this specification implicitly defines the integral scale @xmath10 and the intermittency coefficient @xmath34 . in order for the process @xmath35 to have finite variance in the limit @xmath24",
    ", one should impose @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 can be shown to obey self similarity exactly , i.e. for a time scale contraction @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) @xmath39,\\ ] ] with @xmath40 a gaussian random variable of variance @xmath41 @xcite . from equation ( [ cascade ] ) one can show that @xcite @xmath42 with @xmath43 a q - dependent factor and @xmath44 a non linear function of @xmath4 , i.e. the process @xmath0 is multi - scaling .",
    "it should be understood that the scaling ( [ scalingmrw ] ) is exact only in the continuous time limit @xmath24 .",
    "nonetheless for @xmath45 one can recover good approximations of the scaling even when considering the discretized version @xmath31 .",
    "the main appeal of this model for describing stock returns evolution lies in its ability to reproduce faithfully the most common stylised facts of financial markets : the hyperbolic decay of the volatility auto covariance function ( [ covmrw ] ) as well as the heavy tails of the process increments . indeed , as shown in @xcite , the probability of observing increments larger than a certain value @xmath46 decays as a power law for large @xmath46 : @xmath47 the parameter @xmath34 controls therefore also the thickness of the tails of the returns distribution .",
    "the stationarity and the causal structure of this model make it also preferable to other multifractal models @xcite .",
    "one of the most important features though , is that the multi - fractal spectrum of this model can be computed exactly to be @xcite @xmath48 the scaling function @xmath49 is therefore a parabola whose constant concavity only depends on @xmath50 .",
    "let us here start to look at the theoretical relation between the intermittency coefficient @xmath34 and the ghe that can be established from the identity @xmath51 .",
    "since the scaling exponents @xmath17 are computed from the scaling of the empirical moments , one has for the log - normal mrw that @xmath4 is bounded from above by @xcite @xmath52 hence @xmath34 and @xmath4 must be chosen jointly in such a way that the last inequality holds .",
    "as shown in section [ sec3 ] , typical values of @xmath34 obtained for financial data analysed in this study very rarely exceed the value of @xmath53 , which is well within the bound of equation ( [ qlambdaln ] ) . by considering @xmath54 the scaling relation @xmath51 for the mrw ( using equation ( @xmath55 ) ) reads @xmath56 values of the expressions ( [ hs ] ) for different @xmath34 s",
    "are reported in table [ firsttab ] for @xmath57 .",
    "we have performed the following statistical study in order to compare theoretical predictions with ghe s computed on synthetic time series : for a given value of @xmath34 , we have simulated @xmath58 mrw series and computed the corresponding ghe s for every synthetic series ; then , assuming these ghe s are i.i.d .",
    ", which is quite reasonable since every mrw simulation is independent from the others , we have obtained a sample distribution for the ghe s . from this distribution",
    "we have computed the @xmath59-quantiles which give the range of fluctuation of the ghe beyond which any observation can be deemed anomalous .",
    "we have performed this study for @xmath60 , after having checked that the scaling does nt hold for larger @xmath4 s .",
    "results of this analysis for @xmath57 and @xmath61 are reported in table [ secondtab ] . by comparing these values with those expected from the mrw model in table [ firsttab ]",
    "we can conclude that all values computed via the equations given in ( [ hs ] ) are compatible with the statistical confidence intervals computed on the synthetic time series .",
    "in figure [ fig2 ] we plot the scaling exponents @xmath62 and @xmath63 computed on synthetic mrw time series with intermittency @xmath64 together with the theoretical relations ( [ hs ] ) ( black solid lines ) .",
    "the measured scaling exponents are found to be fluctuating around the theoretical relations .",
    "although in this figure we show only the cases @xmath65 , we have also verified that the case @xmath66 is consistent with the expected behaviour @xmath67 .",
    ".[firsttab ] values of @xmath17 for @xmath60 computed through the expressions in equation ( [ hs ] ) for @xmath57 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     overall we can say that both modifications of the log - normal mrw model confirm that beefing up the tails of the distribution of synthetic time series has a sizeable impact on multifractal properties , with the percentage of anomalous fluctuations being drastically reduced .",
    "nonetheless , we still observe some stocks systematically overpassing the confidence intervals that do not allow to accept globally the hypothesis of constant multifractality .",
    "main scope of this paper has been to measure and validate variations of multifractality on a set of stock returns . as a benchmark we have considered the mrw model , a parsimonious multifractal model that is able to reproduce faithfully many features commonly observed in stock returns . since the dynamical estimations of multifractality are made on relatively small samples , to validate the observed fluctuations in the degree of multifractality as truly significant ,",
    "we have shown that the fluctuations observed in empirical data are truly crossing the extreme quantiles expected from a mrw with constant intermittency coefficient .",
    "confidence intervals have been computed by estimating a proxy of multifractality on different realisations of mrw s simulated with parameters obtained from each empirical time series .",
    "we can conclude that the tails of the unconditional distribution of stock returns contribute significantly to the observed fluctuations of multifractality , but can not fully explain the totality of the quantile crossings .",
    "thus the disagreement between model and data could be possibly explained assuming the intermittency parameter to be time varying , which corresponds to having a breakdown in the serial dependence of the volatility .",
    "a possible time varying nature of the intermittency would also affect the tails of the distribution , which depend critically on @xmath34 .",
    "we have also shown that increasing the intermittency coefficient makes , as indeed expected , the tails of the ghe distribution computed on the synthetic series thicker , while we found no relevant dependence with @xmath10 .",
    "our analysis thus suggests that a varying intermittency coefficient may be the correct guess towards the inclusion of the observed empirical facts into future multifractal modelling . a natural extension , which we are investigating at the present ,",
    "is the possibility of identifying switching points between multifractality regimes , as suggested by research contributions in regime switching for dynamical correlation @xcite . as with cross - correlation",
    ", one could model the temporal correlation of the volatility to be switching between different regimes of stationarity , although the association of the switching points with realistic economic triggers is yet to be established .",
    "starting from these results , our main future aim is the development of a realistic model for stock dynamics which incorporate these empirical findings , possibly backed by a plausible economic ground about what triggers multifractality to change over time .",
