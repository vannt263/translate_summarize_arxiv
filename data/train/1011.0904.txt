    "one needs to assume inefficient cooling of ultra - relativistic electrons / positrons up to energies @xmath105 inefficient cooling of such energetic electrons / positrons implies very weak magnetic fields and , therefore , puts strong constraints on the efficiency of the proton acceleration and on efficiency of photo - meson energy losses via limitation of the maximal proton energy .",
    "furthermore , as sikora et al .",
    "( 2009 ) demonstrated , in order to avoid overproduction of x - rays in these magnetically weak sources by ssc radiation of primary electrons , it is necessary to assume the source sizes of the order of parsecs , and for such sources the efficiency of the photo - meson process is further reduced .",

    "the main purpose of proton - synchrotron models was to explain the relatively stable shape of the tev spectra in variable low luminosity bl lac objects ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aharonian 2000 ) ) .",
    "obviously , the critical issue of such models is whether protons can reach sufficiently large energies to produce synchrotron spectra extending up to tev energies .",

    "disproving interpretation of high energy spectra of blazars produced via hadronic models does not disprove the presence of protons in agn jets .",
    "they simply are expected to be radiatively inefficient but are likely to dominate the jet energy flux and strongly affect the dynamics of dissipation processes via shocks in the regions of low magnetization parameter ( @xmath122 ) . in this scenario , a large fraction of dissipated energy must be converted to relativistic electrons , otherwise leptonic models will be inefficient despite high radiative efficiencies of energetic electrons . however in order to get electrons to participate together with protons in the diffusive shock acceleration process , electrons must be first preheated up to average energy ( to be strict  up to average momentum ) of protons heated by randomization and compression in the shocked plasma .",
    "several scenarios have been investigated for such electron preheating , both analytically and in pic - simulations ( ( * ? ? ?",
