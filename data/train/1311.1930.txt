    "outer billiards is a simple dynamical system that was introduced by b. h. neumann in 1950s in @xcite . in the 1970s ,",
    "j. moser popularized outer billiards as a toy model for planetary motion as a means of finding possible unbounded orbits @xcite .",
    "since then , many mathematicians have asked and answered questions about outer billiards systems in various geometries .",
    "for example , in 2004 c. culter proved the existence of periodic orbits for polygonal tables in the euclidean plane ( the proof is presented by s. tabachnikov in @xcite ) .",
    "r. schwarz answered , in the affirmative , moser s question about the existence of unbounded orbits for certain polygons in @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for this paper is a result of vivaldi and shaidenko [ 8 ] that in the euclidean case , outer billiards associated to quasi - rational polygons have all orbits bounded , see also @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "all orbits about a lattice polygon in the euclidean plane are periodic .",
    "we continue the work of dogru and tabachnikov in @xcite who studied the relationship between one - tile regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane and the outer billiards system .    for a detailed account of hyperbolic geometry and the hyperbolic plane , we direct the reader to @xcite , and for a survey of outer billiards , see @xcite .",
    "the outer billiard map associated to a convex polygonal table @xmath0 in the hyperbolic plane is defined as follows . for a point @xmath1 , there are two lines that pass through @xmath2 and are tangent to the table @xmath0 . by convention , we consider the tangent line for which @xmath0 is on the left , from the point of view of @xmath2",
    ". then we reflect @xmath2 about the tangency ( support ) point to get @xmath3 ( see figure [ definition ] ) .",
    "the map is well - defined whenever the tangency point is unique and so we are able to define the map @xmath4 on the entire hyperbolic plane except for the clockwise continuations of the sides of @xmath0 ( see figure [ definition ] ) and their preimages under @xmath4 .",
    "an immediate consequence of the definition is that @xmath4 is a piecewise isometry .",
    "likewise , the inverse map @xmath5 is not defined on the counterclockwise continuations of the sides of @xmath0 .",
    "we define the _ web _ associated to @xmath0 to be the union of all preimages under @xmath4 of the clockwise continuation of the sides and of all preimages under @xmath5 of the counterclockwise continuation of the sides . for each connected component of the complement of the web",
    ", the restriction of the map @xmath6 to that component is defined by a single isometry of the hyperbolic plane for every @xmath7 .",
    "that means that each connected component of the complement of the web maps as a whole under the iterations of @xmath4 .",
    "another feature of the billiards map @xmath4 is that it extends continuously to a continuous circle map @xmath8 at infinity .",
    "the map @xmath9 is defined using the same reflecting procedure . in this case",
    "the uniqueness of the support point is not needed , since the distance between our initial point and the support point is infinite no matter the choice and hence the map @xmath9 is well - defined for every point at infinity . since @xmath9 is a circle map , it has a well defined poincar rotation number @xmath10 , and we will prove in section 3 that @xmath10 encodes information about the combinatorial dynamics of the outer billiards .",
    "we are studying the hyperbolic outer billiards map associated with a polygonal table that is part of a two piece regular tiling of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "these tilings use two polygonal pieces , a regular @xmath11-gon and a regular @xmath12-gon that meet four in each vertex ( see figure [ mntiling ] ) .",
    "we describe the combinatorial dynamics for outer billiards around one of the @xmath11-gons .",
    "we note that the web associated to such a map will fall exactly on the grid lines of the tiling .",
    "this is because the reflection around a vertex of the table tile is just a rotation by @xmath13 around vertices in the tiling .",
    "it follows that each tile maps as a whole under iterations of @xmath4 .",
    "-tiling for @xmath14      previous results describing outer billiards of tiles in the hyperbolic plane are obtained in @xcite . in this paper , the authors have proved that every orbit of the outer billiard map around a right - angled regular @xmath15-gon , for @xmath16 , is periodic .",
    "any right - angled regular @xmath15-gon generates a tiling of the hyperbolic plane entirely consisting of @xmath15-gons .",
    "the theorems proven in the next sections have the same flavor as theorem 4 in the above mentioned paper .",
    "define the _",
    "rank _ of a tile as the minimum number of sides that one has to cross , when starting inside the table , to get to the given tile .",
    "this means that tiles that have one common side with the table have rank 1 , and tiles that have a common side with a tile of rank 1 have rank 2 , and so on .",
    "( dogru - tabachnikov @xcite ) for a tiling of regular @xmath15-gons meeting in 4 , @xmath17 , the dual billiard map @xmath4 preserves the rank of a tile , and every orbit of @xmath4 is periodic .",
    "the set of rank @xmath18 tiles consists of @xmath19 elements , where @xmath20 are the roots of the equation @xmath21 .",
    "the action of @xmath4 on the set of rank @xmath18 tiles is a transitive cyclic permutation @xmath22 where @xmath23 the rotation number of the dual billiard map at infinity is given by the formula @xmath24    the proof of this theorem uses geometric arguments for the periodicity of orbits and recurrence formulas for computing the number of tiles in each rank and the rotation number of @xmath9 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the authors make an important remark that the representation of @xmath25 ( and so the rotation number of the map at infinity ) as a continued fraction encodes the dynamics of the tiles under the billiard map @xmath4",
    ". we will deduce similar results for two - piece tilings .",
    "our results extend theorem 1 to two - piece regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "we will denote a tiling of regular @xmath11-gons and regular @xmath12-gons as an @xmath26-tiling , and we will always consider the table to be an @xmath11-gon .",
    "such an @xmath26-tiling exists if @xmath27 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , these tilings have four shapes meeting at each vertex , two @xmath11-gons and two @xmath12-gons .",
    "most of the geometric arguments used here are analogous to those used by dogru and tabachnikov .",
    "our counting arguments are different , although they are also based on recurrence relations .",
    "let us introduce a more general notation for rank in order to avoid cumbersome indexing .",
    "observe that the layer of tiles of rank @xmath18 includes tiles of the same type ( all @xmath11-gons or all @xmath12-gons ) and as rank changes by one , that shape changes .",
    "so triangles always have even rank and @xmath12-gons always have odd rank .",
    "we will say that a rank @xmath28 tile is a rank @xmath18 @xmath12-gon and a rank @xmath29 tile is a rank @xmath18 triangle .",
    "the rest of this section is dedicated to describing the dynamics of the billiard map @xmath4 in the @xmath30-tilings through the proof of the following theorem :    [ 3n ] for a @xmath30-tiling , @xmath31 , the outer billiard map @xmath4 preserves the rank of a tile and every orbit of @xmath4 is periodic .",
    "the set of rank @xmath18 @xmath12-gons consists of @xmath32 elements and the set of rank @xmath18 triangles consists of @xmath33 elements , where @xmath34 are the two roots of the equation @xmath35 the action of @xmath4 on the set of rank @xmath18 @xmath12-gons is a cyclic permutation @xmath22 where @xmath36 and the action of @xmath4 on the set of rank @xmath18 triangles is also a cyclic permutation @xmath37 where @xmath38 the rotation number of the outer billiard map at infinity is given by the formula @xmath39    theorem 2 contains many independent results and for reasons of clarity we will prove them one by one as claims inside the proof .",
    "every orbit of @xmath4 is periodic .",
    "the proof of this result is written in much detail in @xcite .",
    "we will present here a sketch of it and will refer the reader to @xcite for detailed explanations .",
    "the statement of the claim is a consequence of the following lemma :    [ rankpreserve ] the rank of a tile is preserved under @xmath4 .",
    "_ proof of lemma . _",
    "the proof is by induction on the rank , based on geometrical observations .",
    "observe that rank 1 tiles are preserved by @xmath4 and notice that every rank @xmath18 tile is adjacent to a rank @xmath40 tile , where these two tiles map together under a single application of @xmath4 .",
    "these two facts complete the base case and the step of the induction .",
    "@xmath41    from lemma [ rankpreserve ] , since there are finitely many tiles of rank @xmath18 , every tile must eventually map back to itself after @xmath42-iterations , for some natural number @xmath42 .",
    "hence the @xmath42-th iteration of @xmath4 maps the entire tile to itself .",
    "this implies that @xmath43 is a rotation by either @xmath44 ( for @xmath12-gons ) or @xmath45(for triangles ) around some point inside the tile .",
    "hence @xmath46 restricted to that tile is the identity if the tile is an @xmath12-gon and @xmath47 restricted to that tile is the identity if the tile is a triangle .",
    "we conclude that every orbit of @xmath4 is periodic .    for every @xmath48",
    ", @xmath4 permutes the rank @xmath18 tiles cyclically .",
    "this claim is an immediate corollary to the following lemma :    any two consecutive rank @xmath18 tiles are mapped to two consecutive rank @xmath18 tiles .    _",
    "proof of lemma .",
    "_ we know by lemma [ rankpreserve ] that the rank of two tiles is preserved .",
    "if the two consecutive tiles are not separated by a clockwise continuation of one of the sides of the table then their common point is mapped , together with the two tiles , through the same vertex .",
    "thus the tiles are mapped to two consecutive tiles .    if the two tiles are separated by such a continuation of one side of the table then the argument is more involved .",
    "a similar argument is presented in @xcite .",
    "figure 3 gives a pictorial representation of the situation .",
    "the first tile is reflected in @xmath49 , while the second one is reflected in @xmath50 .",
    "what remains to prove is that @xmath51=@xmath52 so that the images of the two tiles still touch in one point .",
    "the following sequence of equalities completes the proof : @xmath53        in order to compute the formulas for @xmath54 we first explain why the tiling we are working with has an intrinsic self - similar geometric structure .",
    "we will refer from now on to this self - similar structure as the _ crochet pattern_. to describe the crochet pattern , we consider @xmath12-gons to be of two types ( see figure [ 37tiling ] ) , @xmath55-type and @xmath56-type .",
    "type @xmath55 @xmath12-gons have two parents `` in the sense that they touch two @xmath12-gons of the previous rank , while type @xmath56 @xmath12-gons touch only one parent '' .",
    "the rank 1 @xmath12-gons are of neither of the types , having 0 parents , so we call them type 0 @xmath12-gons .",
    "( this is why our counting argument begins with counting rank @xmath57 @xmath12-gons . )",
    "the following claim gives an intuitive explanation of why we call this self - similar structure of the tiling a crochet pattern .",
    "when passing from the @xmath18-th layer of @xmath12-gons to the @xmath58-th layer of @xmath12-gons , we apply the following replacement rules : @xmath59 @xmath60 i.e. , when incrementing rank of the layer by 1 , every @xmath55 gets replaced by an @xmath55 followed by @xmath61 @xmath56 s , and every @xmath56 gets replaced by an @xmath55 followed by @xmath62 @xmath56 s .",
    "the methods used to prove this claim have been developed by poincar and we will not dwell on the details here . the reader can find extensive explanation in _ the symmetry of things _ @xcite .    instead , we will illustrate the methods used to prove the claim in the case of @xmath63 in order to give the geometrical intuition behind the proof .",
    "figure [ 37tiling ] illustrates the local and global behavior of a @xmath64-tiling .    in the local picture ,",
    "the difference between a type @xmath55 @xmath65-gon and a type @xmath56 @xmath65-gon is encoded in the different types of degenerate heptagons we associate to them .",
    "we associate to the @xmath56-type heptagon a rectangle with 3 additional points on the upper side , while to the @xmath55-type heptagon we associate a rectangle with 2 additional points on the upper side and 1 additional point on the lower side , since it has two parents . now by reducing the triangles in the global picture to points , we notice that the heptagons must meet 3 in each vertex .",
    "this results in the crochet pattern shown in figure 4 ( left ) .",
    "this crochet pattern immediately implies the claimed replacement rules .         we can now use this crochet pattern to start our counting argument in order to get the exact numbers in theorem [ 3n ] .",
    "the formulas for @xmath54 hold as stated in theorem [ 3n ] .",
    "denote the number of @xmath55-type and @xmath56-type @xmath12-gons of rank @xmath18 by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , and use claim 3 to obtain the following system of linear difference equations : @xmath68    the initial configuration is @xmath69 , because there must be three rank 2 @xmath12-gons with two parents , and the rest of the vertices of the rank 1 @xmath12-gons must serve as an anchor for a different @xmath56-type rank 2 @xmath12-gon . solving this recurrence",
    "gives the general term formula :    @xmath70 where @xmath71 from here the formula for @xmath72 follows immediately .",
    "to count the triangles of rank @xmath18 , we observe that the triangles of rank @xmath18 are the next layer after the @xmath12-gons of rank @xmath18 , and each @xmath55-type @xmath12-gon is replaced by @xmath73 triangles and each @xmath56-type is replaced by @xmath74 triangles .",
    "hence the formula for @xmath75 can be computed .    in order to count how many rank @xmath18 @xmath12-gons @xmath4 jumps ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath76 , we need to define @xmath77 as the number of rank @xmath18 @xmath12-gons in a small cone as can be seen in figure [ 37tiling ] .",
    "a small cone is opposite to one of the triangles vertices and does nt contain any side of the triangle . in the same way , a big cone",
    "( see figure [ 37tiling ] ) is opposite to one of the sides of a triangle and contains the table .",
    "the number of rank @xmath18 @xmath12-gons in a big cone is just @xmath78 because of the 3-fold symmetry of the tiling .    for the same reasons as above we need to introduce",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 , the number of @xmath55-type and @xmath56-type rank @xmath18 @xmath12-gons in a small cone , respectively . with this , @xmath81 .",
    "the billiard map @xmath4 makes any tile jump over 2 small cones and one big cone so in total it will jump @xmath82 by studying the structure small cone we observe the crochet pattern once again .",
    "one can notice that the cone that starts at the last @xmath55-type @xmath12-gon of the rank @xmath18 ( @xmath83 ) layer looks exactly the same as the initial small cone .",
    "that is why @xmath77 is equal to the total number of @xmath12-gons obtained by starting with an @xmath55-type @xmath12-gon and using the replacement rules in claim 3 .",
    "we express this as a sum : @xmath84 which , after some computation becomes : @xmath85    the formula for @xmath86 follows immediately .",
    "@xmath87 is computed in the same manner as @xmath88 was computed .",
    "as we have already said , every @xmath55 type @xmath12-gon is replaced by @xmath73 triangles and every @xmath56 type @xmath12-gon is replaced by @xmath74 triangles on the next level and this procedure leaves uncounted only one rank @xmath18 triangle in the small cone , so @xmath89 .",
    "the rotation number @xmath10 equals @xmath90    the @xmath18-th layer of @xmath12-gons gives a discrete approximation of the circle map at infinity and so @xmath91 is an approximation of @xmath10 as @xmath18 goes to @xmath92 . by taking the limit we obtained the desired formula for the rotation number @xmath10 .",
    "this last claim completes the proof of all the statements in theorem 2 .",
    "\\(i ) one might expect the formulas in theorem 2 to also work for @xmath93 , i.e. , a @xmath94-tiling of the euclidean plain .",
    "that is not the case even though the crochet pattern works exactly the same also in the @xmath94-tiling .",
    "the difference that appears when computing the formulas in the @xmath94-tiling is that the matrix of the difference system is not diagonalizable anymore and so its powers look completely different .",
    "\\(ii ) note that the determinant of all the matrices given by the crochet pattern is 1 .",
    "we believe this is true because the crochet pattern replacement can also be reversed , i.e. , starting with rank @xmath18 layer , we can construct the rank @xmath40 layer .",
    "\\(iii ) according to theorem 2 , one can express the eigenvalues @xmath95 and @xmath96 via the rotation number @xmath10 .",
    "therefore this rotation number determines the numbers @xmath97 , and hence the whole dynamics of the map @xmath4 .",
    "next we consider the case of a general @xmath26-tiling .",
    "the theorem and subsequent proof are analogous to those in the @xmath30 case in the previous subsection , but we must consider the cases separately due to a difference in the counting method . in the previous section , @xmath12-gons were classified into types @xmath55 and @xmath56 , having two parents and one parent , respectively",
    ". however , due to the difference in geometry of triangles versus generic @xmath11-gons , the tilings in the @xmath98 case never produce @xmath12-gons with two parents . in this case ,",
    "@xmath12-gons either have one parent or no parent , which we denote as types @xmath56 and @xmath99",
    ". this alternate counting method will be explained in detail in the proof , but first we state the theorem :    for an @xmath26-tiling with @xmath100 the outer billiard map @xmath4 preserves the rank of a tile and every orbit of @xmath4 is periodic .",
    "the set of rank @xmath18 @xmath12-gons consists of @xmath101 elements , and the set of rank @xmath18 @xmath11-gons consists of @xmath102 elements , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the two roots of the equation @xmath105 .",
    "the action of @xmath4 on the set of rank @xmath18 @xmath12-gons is a cyclic permutation @xmath22 where @xmath106 and the action of @xmath4 on the set of rank @xmath18 @xmath11-gons is also a cyclic permutation @xmath37 where @xmath107 the rotation number of the outer billiard map at infinity is given by the formula @xmath108    if @xmath109 , the statement of theorem 3 reduces to that of theorem 1 .",
    "the proof of theorem 3 also consists of several steps .",
    "every orbit of @xmath4 is periodic .",
    "the proof of this claim is analogous to the proof in the previous section . because the rank of each tile is preserved under the billiard map , and",
    "because there are finitely many tiles of a given rank , every tile must map back to itself after some finite number of iterations @xmath42 .",
    "when the tile maps back to itself , it has rotated by @xmath110 if it is an @xmath11-gon or by @xmath111 if it is an @xmath12-gon .",
    "then @xmath112 is the identity if the tile is an @xmath11-gon and @xmath113 is the identity if the tile is an @xmath12-gon .    for every @xmath48",
    ", @xmath4 permutes the rank @xmath18 tiles cyclically .",
    "proof is similar to that for claim 2 .",
    "recall that we defined type @xmath56 tiles to have one parent and type @xmath99 tiles to have zero parents ( see figure [ fig:4 - 5labeled ] ) .",
    "we now give a crochet pattern for general @xmath26-tilings , @xmath114 .",
    "the following replacement rules hold for @xmath26-tilings .",
    "@xmath115 @xmath116        in a similar manner to the @xmath30 case , we represent type @xmath56 and @xmath99 tiles as degenerate polygons , with additional vertices .",
    "see figure [ fig:4 - 5crochet ] for illustrations of the @xmath117 case .",
    "type @xmath56 tiles are represented as quadrilaterals with @xmath12 vertices , and type @xmath99 tiles are represented as triangles with @xmath12 vertices . because a @xmath56 tile has @xmath74 sides available to connect with a tile of higher rank , a rank @xmath18 @xmath56 tile produces @xmath74 @xmath56 tiles of rank @xmath58 .",
    "then , since tiles must meet @xmath11-to - a - vertex , there must be @xmath118 @xmath99 tiles between every pair of @xmath56 tiles , and there must be @xmath119 type @xmath99 tiles following the last @xmath56 .",
    "similarly , a @xmath99 tile has @xmath120 edges free to connect to a tile of higher rank , so a rank @xmath18 @xmath99 tile produces @xmath120 @xmath56 tiles of rank @xmath58 , again with @xmath99 tiles appropriately interspersed .",
    "this crochet pattern tiles the hyperbolic plane with @xmath11 @xmath12-gons meeting at every vertex . from this tiling",
    ", we obtain the @xmath26-tiling by considering the points in the tiling becoming @xmath11-gons , as in figure [ fig : kaleido ] ( compare with @xcite ) .",
    "the described crochet pattern translates to the replacement rules given above .",
    "we can now compute the formulas for the number of @xmath11- and @xmath12-gons of any rank , as well as for the cyclic permutation of @xmath11- and @xmath12-gons of any rank .",
    "the formulas for @xmath54 hold as stated in theorem 3 .    denoting the number of @xmath56 type and @xmath99 type @xmath12-gons of rank @xmath18 by @xmath67 and @xmath121 , respectively , we obtain the following recursion formula : @xmath122 where the matrix @xmath123 is given below and is obtained from the rules given in ( [ eq : crochety ] ) and ( [ eq : crochetz ] ) . @xmath124 as mentioned above , the initial conditions are @xmath125 .    solving the recurrence , we find the general formula :    @xmath126 where @xmath127 then @xmath128 , so @xmath129    now that we have counted the @xmath12-gons , we count the @xmath11-gons of rank @xmath18 by noticing a pattern in the tiling .",
    "we see that a type @xmath56 @xmath12-gon of rank @xmath18 produces @xmath74 @xmath11-gons of rank @xmath18 , and a type @xmath99 @xmath12-gon produces @xmath120 @xmath11-gons .",
    "thus the number of @xmath11-gons of rank @xmath18 is given by @xmath130 .",
    "the formula for @xmath88 given in theorem 3 follows .",
    "next we determine @xmath76 by counting how many tiles a rank @xmath18 @xmath12-gon  jumps \" when @xmath4 is applied . as in the previous section ,",
    "we define @xmath77 as the number of rank @xmath18 @xmath12-gons in a small cone .",
    "we call @xmath131 and @xmath132 the number of rank @xmath18 @xmath56s and @xmath99s , respectively , in the small cone . also , as before , applying @xmath4 to any tile causes the tile to jump over two small cones and one big cone . in total",
    ", the jump is given by @xmath133 .",
    "we observe that @xmath134 where @xmath123 is given in ( [ eq : amatrix ] ) .",
    "this becomes @xmath135 \\end{pmatrix},\\ ] ] where @xmath136 .",
    "then , since @xmath137 , we have @xmath138    this allows us to calculate @xmath76 and we can compute @xmath87 by noticing again that every @xmath56 type @xmath12-gon will be replaced by @xmath74 @xmath11-gons and every @xmath99 type @xmath139-gon will be replaced by @xmath74 @xmath11-gons on the next level and this procedure will leave again only one @xmath11-gon out , so @xmath140 .",
    "the rotation number is given by @xmath108    this results from taking the limit of @xmath91 as @xmath141 .",
    "the methods used in this paper both for geometrical and counting arguments can be used also for all other tilings with 2-fold symmetries in the vertices and so we believe that similar theorems and observations can be deduced in a more general setting .",
