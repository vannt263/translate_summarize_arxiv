    "a precise description of sound propagation and absorption in phononic crystal for a large frequency domain is of great interest in order to study transition between low and high frequency . at low frequencies , i.e. when the viscous and thermal skin depths are comparable to the crystal characteristic dimension , important dissipation effects occur .",
    "these effects are well described by the long wavelength homogenization theories  @xcite .",
    "simple fluid dynamics problems are to be solved : a stokes unsteady fluid flow problem for the velocity , and a fourier unsteady heat conduction problem for the temperature .",
    "studies describing the propagation by the homogenization theory can be found in literature  @xcite .",
    "when the frequency increases enough , such separation no longer is possible and the problem transforms into a full wave propagation problem with multiple scattering effects becoming predominent .",
    "these effects may lead to band gaps ( frequency regions where the propagation is forbidden ) .",
    "different existing numerical methods allowing to determine these band gaps can be found in the literature  @xcite . for the purpose of studying the transition between low and high frequency regime we first extend the numerical method using schlmilch series  @xcite to include visco - thermal effects . as a result ,",
    "a numerical method is obtained which takes into account viscous , thermal and multiple scattering effects .",
    "then , a comparison with experimental data ( high frequencies ) on one hand and with homogenization theory results ( low frequencies ) on the other hand is performed .",
    "finally the transition between low and high frequencies is discussed .",
    "we consider sound propagation and absorption through a 2d periodic square arrangement of rigid cylinders embedded in air for a large frequency domain .",
    "this domain includes important multiple scattering as well as visco - thermal effects .",
    "the three geometries represented on figure  [ fig_problem ] are considered .",
    "the first problem is a row containing an infinite number of cylinders periodically spaced according to @xmath0 axis and insonified by ( right and left ) ingoing plane waves .",
    "the second one is an arrangement of @xmath1 rows of cylinders with the same periodicity according to @xmath2 and @xmath0 axis and subject to the same ingoing plane waves . in a last problem",
    ", we consider the case of an infinite periodic medium called `` phononic crystal '' .",

    "firstly , we consider an equivalent surface admittance surrounding each cylinder ( method a ) . using this concept , previously described by tournat et al .",
    "@xcite , weak dissipation localized in the cylinder boundary layers can be considered .",
    "secondly , a complete description allowing for losses ( localized or not ) in all the fluid is presented ( method b ) .",
    "analytically , the two problems are formulated in terms of the displacement @xmath3 and the ( excess ) temperature @xmath4 fields . in the first case ( method a ) , these fields derive from an acoustic scalar potential @xmath5 , @xmath6 which satisfies the 2d helmholtz equation  @xcite ( convention @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the angular frequency and @xmath10 is the adiabatic sound speed .",
    "the visco - thermal effects occuring in the boundary layers are considered in the following boundary condition set at cylinder surfaces , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the normal derivative and @xmath13 is the equivalent surface admittance operator which depends notably on fluid properties ( kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity ) .",
    "expression of this operator ( in the limit of small boundary layers ) can be found in  @xcite for the 2d cylindrical case .    in the second case ( method b ) , the displacement and temperature fields can be related  ( @xcite ) to three potentials : acoustic @xmath5 , entropic @xmath14 and vorticity @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the coefficient of thermal expansion , @xmath18 the temperature , @xmath19 the specific heat at constant pressure and @xmath20 the thermal diffusivity .",
    "all these parameters depend on the fluid nature .",
    "the three potentials ( we set @xmath21 ) obey to the 2d helmholtz equations  ( @xcite ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the real wavenumber @xmath24 is related to acoustic propagation while the complex wavenumbers @xmath25 and",
    "@xmath26 are related to viscous and thermal waves respectively .",
    "the three potentials are coupled at the cylinders boundaries by the following conditions , @xmath27 cancelling displacement and temperature fields .",
    "having in view the determination of the floquet - bloch modes ( in the @xmath2 direction of the phononic cristal ) , we will in methods a and b expand the potentials in terms of right and left going plane waves , @xmath28    where the `` @xmath29 '' index is either @xmath30 ( for the acoustic potential ) , @xmath31 ( for the entropic potential ) or @xmath32 ( for the vorticity potential ) , and the index @xmath33 determines the possible wavevectors through ( @xmath34 ) and the condition @xmath35 which must be satisfied in order to respect the @xmath0 periodicity .",

    "at this point , we must estimate schlmilch series of the form @xmath47 .",
    "for the usual case @xmath48 defined in relation  ( [ k_ahv ] ) with @xmath49 , and due to the slow convergence of schlmilch series , these sums are developed in the form  @xcite which present a better convergence . for the more original cases @xmath50 and",

    "the band gap locations are well described in all cases because they are essentially due to multiple scattering effects only . however , outside these bands , an accurate prediction of the transmission coefficients needs taking into account the visco - thermal losses .",
    "the two visco - thermal descriptions lead to the same predictions because the dissipation effects occuring during the propagation are entirely localized in the small boundary layers .",

    "previous numerical studies based on homogenization theory ( limited to leading order terms ) and using finite element methods to solve the problem of long wavelength sound absorption in 2d phononic crystal ( figure  [ fig_problem ] case ( c ) ) have been performed by cortis  @xcite .",
    "the principle of these long wavelength simulations is to solve the unsteady stokes equation for velocity and the unsteady fourier equation for temperature .",
    "it exploits in consistent manner the fact that ( to leading order ) the velocity field becomes divergence - free at the pore scale ( for the purpose of evaluating viscous effects ) and the pressure field becomes uniform ( for the purpose of evaluating thermal effects ) . in order to compare these existing homogenization results to those given by the two visco - thermal models including multiple scattering , we compare the real part of our complex velocity @xmath71 associated to the phononic crystal with that given by cortis results .",

    ", the two visco - thermal models tends towards cortis results .",
    "consequently and for the geometrical dimension considered here , our two models successfully fulfill the two asymptotic limits .",
    "this is because in the low frequency regime considered here , the dissipation effects are still localized in small boundary layers .",
    "when the frequency increases , multiple scattering effects emerge and , as expected , the ( leading order terms ) classical homogenization results are no more able to predict the correct velocity . here , the real part of the velocity decreases and tends towards zero quickly due to the first band gap where the propagation is forbidden . at this point",
    ", we can precisely study the transition between a long wavelentgh visco - thermal description of sound propagation and the emergence of multiple scattering effects .",
    "the limit of the classical homogenization theory for a simple 2d phononic crystal of 0.90 porosity case appears near @xmath73 .",
    "the same limit was found for other porosities decreasing from 0.90 to 0.50 .",
    "description of sound absorption using classical homogenization theory is not accurate beyond this frequency limit . in the presented case ,",
    "the dissipation effects are very weak ( @xmath74 modification on phase velocity ) and localized in very small boundary layers .",

    ", the transition shall be described by considering the complete multiple scattering calculations .",

    "phononic crystal made up of @xmath79 radius cylinders . in this second geometry",
    ", the transition can only be described considering important visco - thermal effects not localized at cylinder boundary layers.,width=321 ]    besides , we know that in the high frequency limit , the velocity @xmath80 given by the homogenization theory reaches an asymptotic value which is related to the tortuosity @xmath81  @xcite ( geometrical characteristic of porous media ) with the following relation , @xmath82 this high frequency limit in view of long wavelength theory is just that matched by the ideal fluid results , in view of multiple scattering theory , in the low frequency limit ( absence of multiple scattering effects ) .",
    "corresponding values are indicated on figures  [ fig_v ] and  [ fig_v ] by the top horizontal line .",
    "the tortuosity values obtained with the ideal fluid model ( at the low frequency limit ) are in very good agreement with those from literature  @xcite .",
    "however , these values are never reached when considering both visco - thermal and multiple scattering effects as illustrated on figures  [ fig_v ] and [ fig_v ] .",
    "this observation confirms the existence of a large frequency domain ( from @xmath73 for this example ) where viscous , thermal and multiple scattering effects coexist . in this region ,",
    "sound propagation and absorption can only be described by taking into account all these effects together .",
    "in summary , we have extended an existing model describing the multiple scattering effects on 2d phononic crystal ( using schlmilch series ) by including viscous and thermal effects .",
    "the main results consists in the existence of a large frequency domain where both multiple scattering and visco - thermal effects shall be taken into account .",
    "for an usual millimetric geometry surrounded by air , dissipation effects are very weak in the transition domain .",
    "thus the description can be performed using the simple equivalent surface admittance concept considered in  @xcite ( including the visco - thermal effects in the small boundary layers near the cylinders ) . however , for a micrometric geometry , this simple description becomes inaccurate due to the fact that the boundary layers are not small . in this paper , this case was successfully described by a general complete multiple scattering calculation .",
    "however , the studied transition will also be reproduced by an extended addmittance approach ( removing the assumption of small boundary layers ) as long as the viscous and thermal boundary layers are not overlapping between the different cylinders .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that we can precisely recover the high frequency limit of the classical homogenization results with our complete multiple scattering calculation in the given 2d phononic crystal ."
