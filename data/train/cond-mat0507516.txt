    "there is much current interest in exploiting morphological instabilities to form periodic nanoscale patterns at crystal surfaces @xcite .",
    "because of their natural in - plane anisotropy , vicinal surfaces @xcite prepared at a miscut relative to a high symmetry orientation provide ideal substrates for the formation of ripple patterns parallel or perpendicular to the mean step orientation @xcite . here",
    "we specifically consider patterns formed by _",
    "step bunching _ , the process in which a train of initially equally spaced ( straight ) steps splits into regions of densely packed steps ( step bunches ) , and almost flat regions @xcite . bunched semiconductor surfaces are promising templates for the growth of metallic nanowires @xcite .",
    "step bunching can be induced by growth @xcite , sublimation @xcite , or surface migration of adatoms driven by an electric current @xcite .",
    "the common feature of the different instability mechanisms @xcite is that they break the symmetry between the ascending and descending steps bordering a terrace .",
    "the appearance of step bunches thus provides information about the asymmetry of the attachment / detachment processes at the steps , as well as about the direction of current - induced adatom migration .",
    "once formed , the shape of a bunch is determined by the balance between the destabilizing forces and the repulsive step - step interactions that act to regularize the step train . as a result ,",
    "the bunch shape displays characteristic scaling laws relating e.g. its slope and width to the number of steps in the bunch @xcite .",
    "these scaling laws are used in the interpretation of experiments to extract the functional form of the step interactions as well as material parameters such as the step interaction strength and the electromigration force @xcite .",
    "the large scale properties of step bunches are captured by continuum evolution equations for the surface profile @xcite , which can be derived from the underlying discrete step dynamics in a systematic manner @xcite .",
    "the analysis of static ( time - independent ) solutions of these equations leads to scaling laws which are in reasonable agreement with numerical simulation of the discrete step dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of a non - vanishing sublimation or growth flux , step bunches are moving objects .",
    "because of the high temperatures involved , sublimation  and hence , bunch motion  is significant also in electromigration experiments , where it is not the primary cause of bunching @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we show that bunch motion alters the shape and scaling properties of bunches in a fundamental way .",
    "it removes the artificial symmetry between the in - flow and out - flow regions ( in which steps move into and out of the bunch , respectively ) and the concomitant singularities of the static solutions at the bunch edges @xcite .",
    "we show that the lateral speed of a bunch is inversely proportional to its height for a large class of models , and we identify the size of the largest terrace @xmath0 as a natural scaling parameter , in terms of which other important bunch characteristics are expressed in a simple way .",
    "the maximal terrace size @xmath0 is uniquely defined , in contrast to the number of steps in the bunch , which requires a convention to decide which steps belong to it , and it is directly accessible experimentally by means of reflection electron microscopy ( rem ) @xcite .",
    "we consider a system of non - transparent steps @xcite described on the discrete level by the equations of motion @xmath1 for the step positions @xmath2 , where the time scale has been normalized to the growth or sublimation flux .",

    "the linear form of the first two terms on the right hand side of ( [ discrete_time_evolution ] ) is characteristic of slow attachment / detachment kinetics , and applies equally to step bunching induced by sublimation , growth or surface electromigration @xcite ; here we will assume a sublimating step train going uphill in the @xmath4 direction .",

    ". the bunches coarsen slowly in time by coalescence .",
    "we are interested in the final regime of coarsening with a few big bunches left in the system . in this regime , one can study a periodic array of identical bunches , each containing @xmath11 steps , which satisfy ( [ discrete_time_evolution ] ) with @xmath12 and the helicoidal boundary conditions @xmath13 .",
    "it is convenient to consider the comoving step coordinates @xmath14 , in which the center of mass of the step configuation does not move . in this frame ,",
    "the stationary trajectory of a step is a periodic function with some ( unknown ) period @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "stationarity implies that every step follows the same trajectory , up to a space and time shift , according to @xmath17 with @xmath18 . inserting this into ( [ discrete_time_evolution ] ) and setting @xmath19",

    "the continuum description is generally found to work very well , provided the asymmetry @xmath3 is sufficiently small . in fig.[fig_singular_m ] we compare the corresponding slope profile to the time - independent solution derived in @xcite by setting the terms inside the square brackets in ( [ pde ] ) to zero and neglecting the symmetry - breaking term @xmath59 . as was anticipated in @xcite ,",
    "the moving bunch is distinctly asymmetric .",
    "moreover the moving solution extends smoothly over the whole @xmath60-axis , whereas the static solution has finite support due to singularities at the bunch edges . in the following",

    "one expects @xmath127 to leading order .",
    "numerical studies suggest however strong finite size corrections even for large bunches , @xmath128 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath84 is rather well approximated by @xmath129 where  @xmath130 and typically @xmath131 is not small , e.g. , for @xmath132 from fig.[fig_h(ksi ) ] , @xmath131 @xmath133 in the range of bunch sizes @xmath134 .",
    "if we nevertheless use the asymptotic expression @xmath135 in ( [ first_terrace_size])-([w ] ) we recover the scaling laws derived in @xcite for static bunches , however with different numerical prefactors .",
    "this provides an _ a posteriori _",
    "justification for the agreement between the predictions for static bunches and the numerical data in @xcite .",
    "noting that the dimensionless parameter @xmath136 introduced in @xcite is given by @xmath137 in the present units , we see that ( [ first_terrace_size ] ) and ( [ minimal_terrace_size ] ) reduce to @xmath138 and @xmath139 , which is to be compared with the expressions @xmath140 and @xmath141 for static bunches . from ( [ w ] )",

    "this reflects the fact that moving bunches are considerably broader than their static counterparts , because of the gradual increase of the terrace sizes in the outflow region , and explains the significant discrepancy between numerical and analytic estimates for @xmath117 in @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that for a general step - step interaction exponent @xmath143 in ( [ step - step interaction ] ) we arrive at generalized scaling laws @xmath144 and @xmath145 which are , apart from strong finite size corrections , consistent with the ones derived in @xcite .",

    "the material parameters given in @xcite lead to the estimate @xmath158 in the low temperature regime and @xmath159 in the high temperature regime .",
    "the latter is presumably an upper bound , since a recent estimate @xcite of the kinetic length @xcite @xmath160 ( where @xmath161 is the adatom diffusion coefficient ) at 1200@xmath157  c indicates that the step mobility @xmath162 increases less rapidly with increasing temperature than was assumed in @xcite .",

    "in this paper we have shown that the continuum equation ( [ pde ] ) faithfully represents the properties of moving step bunches for sufficiently small values of @xmath3 , and that it can be used to extract accurate analytic expressions for the bunch shape and its various characteristic length scales .",
    "our study reveals a central role of the point of minimal slope ( or maximal terrace size ) where the outflow region of one bunch joins the inflow region of the next .",
    "an important ingredient is a fourier analysis of the discrete equations of step motion , which yields an inverse dependence of the bunch speed on bunch size under rather general conditions .",
    "further work is needed to analytically derive the coefficient @xmath37 in ( [ vlat ] ) , and to understand how to obtain the bunch speed directly from the continuum equation , possibly by exploiting a recently proposed analogy to front propagation problems @xcite .",
    "in addition , it seems desirable to study the regime of large @xmath3 , and to investigate the consequences of bunch motion for bunch coarsening beyond simple scaling arguments @xcite .",
    "the conditions assumed in this paper should be realizable in electromigration experiments on si(111 ) at temperatures around 1250@xmath157  c. the gross features of the morphology , such as the maximal terrace size @xmath168 and the bunch width @xmath117 , could be followed in real time using rem , while for the more delicate measurements of @xmath169 and @xmath170 stm - studies would be preferable ."
