    ". however , most of the flc modes are not suitable for pure phase modulation devices because their optical axis sweeps in the plane of the cell substrate producing changes in the polarization state of the incident light . in order to get around the optical axis switching problem",
    "the system consisting of a flc half - wave plate sandwiched between two quarter - wave plates was suggested in ref .",

    "this value is a real challenge for the material science . even though some of the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric liquid crystals possess the desired tilt angle , the difficulty is that the response time dramatically increases when the tilt angle grows up to 45 degrees  @xcite .    in this article",

    "actually , it differs from the well - known kerr effect which is a quadratic electro - optic effect related to the electrically induced birefringence in optically isotropic ( and transparent ) materials and which is mainly caused by the electric - field - induced orientation of polar molecules  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in our case , similar to psbplcs , we deal with the effective dielectric tensor of a nanostructured chiral smectic liquid crystal .",
    "the expression for the components of this tensor   involves averaging over the flc orientational stucture . owing to the symmetry of undisorted flc helix , the zero - field optical anisotropy of dhflc is generally uniaxial with the optical axis parallel to the twisting axis .",
    "another effect is that , for the orientational distortions of the flc helix that are linearly dependent on the electric field and defined in eq .  , the averaging procedure yields the effective dielectric tensor with diagonal ( non - diagonal ) elements being an even ( odd ) function of the electric field .",
    "the latter is behind the quadratic nonlinearity of the principal values of the dielectric tensor and the corresponding refractive indices .",

    "interestingly , the above discussed kerr - like regime may break down when the condition of zero - field isotropy   is fulfilled and @xmath96 .",
    "this is the special case where @xmath97 is proportional to @xmath94 and @xmath98 , so that the optical axis tilt angle @xmath28 decreases with the electric field starting from the zero - field value equal to @xmath99 .",
    "in addition , it turned out that , for low electric fields , the electric field dependence of the dominating contributions to the electrically controlled part of the principal values is linear .",
    "we conclude this section with the remark that the difference of refractive indices  , though formally defined as an in - plane birefringence for a normally incident light , results from the electric field induced optical biaxiality combined with the above discussed out - of - plane rotation of the optical axes .",
