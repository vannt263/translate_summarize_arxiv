    "melting is dominated by ring exchanges @xcite rather than topological defects . from this point of view",
    "the logarithmic repulsion among the imposed vortices in a rotating bec provides an opportunity to study quantum melting of a ` pristine ' wigner solid with long range forces , that is free from the complications of solid state systems .    in this letter",
    "we write down an effective hamiltonian for the vortex degrees of freedom , motivated by an analogy @xcite between the magnus force acting on a vortex moving on a two dimensional neutral superfluid fluid and the lorenz force acting on a charged particle in a magnetic field .",
    "we develop a theoretical approach , borrowing heavily from pioneering ideas of kivelson , kallin , arovas and schrieffer ( kkas ) @xcite , developed in the context of fractional quantized hall effect ( fqhe ) , and suggest a cooperative ring exchange ( cre ) mechanism for quantum melting of vortex lattices in quasi 2d atomic bec and indicate a possible direction for a microscopic understanding of the quantum liquid of molten vortices .",
    "in contrast to many recent theoretical works on atomic bec which exploits an analogy between the hamiltonian of a rotating neutral boson atoms and charge particle in an external magnetic field in two dimensions , our work uses the vortex ( collective ) coordinates directly and provides another microscopic approach to understand quantum melting and the quantum hall - like state that may be formed in these atomic system .",
    "existing theoretical works focus on exact diagonalization @xcite of small number of atoms to get some idea about quantum melting and the possible quantum hall like melted states .",

    "kkas view the laughlin quantum hall state as a wigner solid of electrons in 2d in strong magnetic field , that has been quantum melted by cooperative ring exchange processes .",
    "briefly , ring exchange , as the name suggests , is a cooperative shift of a ring of contiguous particles in an ordered lattice ( figure 1 ) resulting in a cyclic permutation within the ring .",
    "while the amplitude for a quantum tunneling event of a specific ring of size @xmath0 sites is exponentially small @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 , the single particle tunneling amplitude being @xmath3 ) , the number of rings of size @xmath0 is exponentially large @xmath4 .",
    "thus the total amplitude @xmath5 may exponentially diverge , if @xmath6 , leading to a proliferation of ring exchanges and a consequent quantum melting .",
    "this melting depends on the electronic filling fraction , the ratio between the density of conduction electrons and the density of flux quanta .",
    "for very low filling fraction , electrons are expected to form a wigner crystal . at higher filling fraction , electrons forms an incompressible liquid state and",
    "exhibits quantized hall effect .",
    "similarly , we could also expect the quantum melting of the vortex lattices depends on the vortex filling factor , the ratio of the total number of vortex to the total number of boson .",

    "the force acting on a single vortex@xcite is then @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the vortex velocity relative to the superfluid particles and @xmath10 is the superfluid particle density .",
    "the magnus force is equivalent to the lorentz force acting on a charge particle ( @xmath21 ) in a magnetic field .",
    "hence , @xmath22 is the pseudo magnetic field .",
    "the interaction potential between two vortices separated by a distance @xmath23 is v(r ) = - ( ) , where @xmath24 is the coherence length of the vortex core and @xmath25 is the mass of a superfluid particle .",

    "this means that the self - consistent potential seen by a vortex no longer has a component which has long - range order .",
    "the numerical value of the tunneling coefficient @xmath82 determines whether the vortices form the liquid state or wigner crystal . to estimate this tunneling coefficient we consider the following simple exchange path which is shown in figure 1 .",

    "we find that the quantum melting will occur at @xmath128 .",
    "the current experiments @xcite with @xmath129 are in the regimes of vortex lattice ground state .",
    "so our result is consistent with the experimental results , but it does not match very well with the other theoretical results @xcite . the numerical calculation is based on the small number of atomic bosons as well as small number of vortices . in our approach",
    "we assumed a large number of atomic bosons and vortices .",
    "we believe that this discrepancies is related to the system size .",
    "one would say that a large system has been considered in the ref .",
    "@xcite and calculated the melting condition which is comparable to the numerical result @xcite . in the ref .",
    "@xcite , first they have calculated the root mean square of the displacement from the equilibrium position of a vortex in terms of the filling factor @xmath130 .",
    "then they have used the lindemenn criterion and assumed that the melting will occur when the fluctuation of the vortex position is @xmath131 to get the melting condition which is close to the numerical result @xcite .",
    "although the lindemann criterion gives a reasonable description of the melting of a classical solid , there is little evidence that it can be applied to the melting of a vortex lattice .",
    "the vortices are intrinsically quantum objects whose equation of motion are quite different from those of atoms in a harmonic crystal .",
    "in this paper , we treated the vortices as a new degrees of freedom and considered a model hamiltonian of interacting vortices .",
    "later , we assumed the vortices are in the lowest landau level due to the low mass of the vortices and the high densities of the superfluid bose particles .",
    "the concept of cooperative ring exchange is introduced to explain the mechanism of quantum melting of the wigner crystals . finally , we estimated the tunneling coefficient which determines the condition for quantum melting instability of the vortex lattices .",
    "latest experiments @xcite with @xmath132 , @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) and @xcite with @xmath135 , @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) are in the regime in which the ground state is a vortex lattice .",
    "it is a challenge for experimentalists to produce a vortex liquid state in a rotating bose condensed state .",
    "our present work , resulting in a discrete gaussian model ( equation 10 ) predicts laughlin like even denominator bosonic vortex filling fraction @xmath138 , to emerge on quantum melting .",
    "we can also determine the asymptotic form of the wave functions@xcite .",
    "along with a rich phase structure the discrete gaussian model also determines the nature of the quantum melting transition . to the extent the vortex degrees of freedom retain their identity , the results of cre approach may remain valid in the quantum melted region .",
    "this needs to be investigated further .",
    "as mentioned earlier cre processes should leave its finger print as specific fluctuation patterns ( figure 1 ) that preempts quantum melting",
    ". it should be interesting to look for snapshots of such displaced large rings in the actual vortex lattice imaging .",
    "here , we describe how to calculate the parameters @xmath141 and @xmath98 .",
    "we consider the simplest possible exchange path , namely one line of vortices shifting coherently within the wigner crystal .",
    "when the line @xmath142 is displaced , we have @xmath143 , with @xmath144 unity if and only if lattice site @xmath145 lies on the line in question . the matrix element of the potential between two vortices in coherent basis state is v ( * r * ) = _ * r*(*r * ) | v(*r*)| _ * r*(*r * ) .",
    "accordingly , the energy of the displaced line configuration relative to that of the perfect wigner crystal is e = _ i , j .",
    "this sum can be broken up into three terms .",
    "the first term includes all pairs @xmath146 in which both sites @xmath145 and @xmath147 lie off the line .",
    "this contribution to @xmath148 is zero .",
    "the second term involves all pairs @xmath146 where one of the sites , say @xmath145 , is on the line and the other , @xmath147 , is off the line : e_2 = _ i l , j l . clearly the line energy is extensive , hence the energy per tunneling of the vortex can be written u(*d * ) = e_2 / l = _ j l , where we have chosen the origin to lie on the line .",
    "the third and final term is that arising from both @xmath145 and @xmath147 on the line . since the tunneling is cooperative , this contribution to the classical action vanishes .    by allowing one line of vortices to tunnel coherently along the line , one can fit the change in energy @xmath149 into a periodic potential with the appropriate choice of the parameter @xmath141 . on the other hand , by allowing one line of vortices to tunnel coherently perpendicular to the line , one can fit the change in energy into a quadratic potential with appropriate choice of the parameter @xmath150 ."
