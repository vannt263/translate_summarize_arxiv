    "theoretical predictions  @xcite and experimental evidence  @xcite have shown that the one - dimensional conducting channels emerging at the edges of a quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) system are _ helical _ , so that along one boundary spin-@xmath5 electrons propagate ( say ) rightwards , and spin-@xmath6 electrons leftwards.@xcite    a spectacular effect connected to such helical nature is the topological protection from scattering off non - magnetic impurities , which ideally makes helical edge states perfectly conducting 1d channels .",
    "this property has inspired various investigations about the effects of disorder on helical states .",
    "on the one hand , various studies have tested such robustness to disorder when inelastic scattering is included  @xcite , possibly in interplay with rashba impurities@xcite , or when time - reversal symmetry is broken either by magnetic impurities  @xcite or by applied magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , it also been realised that disorder itself can cause an ordinary insulator to undergo a phase transition to a topological insulator ( topological anderson insulator ) .",
    "@xcite in turn , such transition may be strongly modified when disorder exhibits spatial correlations .",
    "@xcite    an important consequence of the helical property is that qshe edge states represent a promising platform for applications to spintronics.@xcite in particular , it has been predicted that charge and spin currents can be steered in multi - terminal devices exploiting a tunnel coupling between the four edge states  @xcite .",
    "typically , such tunnel coupling is modelled as a clean quantum point contact .",
    "however , various sources of disorder may arise when creating a constriction in a qshe quantum well .",
    "indeed , due to the klein tunneling characterizing the dirac spectrum of the helical states , simple gating would not be effective to create a constriction , which instead has to be realized through lithographic techniques combined with an etching process . in doing that",
    ", oxides tend to form at the border of the etched region , leading to a randomly varying electric potential .",
    "in addition , the geometrical profile of the constriction may exhibit roughness , resulting in a randomly varying width of the constriction .",
    "furthermore , a top gate is needed to drive the system into the qshe regime , and the dielectric layer separating the metallic gate from the quantum well is typically an amorphous insulator that naturally leads to local potential fluctuations .",
    "disorder is thus an intrinsic feature in helical tunnel junctions that has to be accounted for",
    ".     causes geometrical disorder , while electrical disorder can originate from the presence of oxides ( small red dots ) produced by the etching process and/or from the potential fluctuations ( bigger green dots ) due to the amorphous dielectric separating the conducting channel from the top gate.,width=302 ]    so far , analytical predictions about disorder effects are mostly available for short tunnel junctions . in that limit",
    ", the spin texture of the helical states has been shown to strongly affect the localization length ,  @xcite whereas the presence of a magnetic field , whose breaking of time - reversal symmetry induces backscattering along the edge states , leads to a peak in the noise correlations .",
    "@xcite as far as finite length tunnel junctions are concerned , results about disorder are mostly limited to numerical approaches that analyzed the transmission coefficient of individual samples.@xcite a thorough investigation covering both single - sample and intrinsic disorder properties of helical tunnel junctions is still lacking .",
    "furthermore , already in the time - reversal symmetric case , it would be desirable for a comparison with experiments to analyze how and to what extent the various disorder sources affect the transmission coefficient .",
    "in this paper we address these problems , analyzing the effects of disorder on the qshe setup depicted in fig.[fig-01 ] , using an effective 1d model , presented in sec.[sec - ii ] , that assumes a randomly varying ( complex ) electron tunneling amplitude between the helical edge states .",
    "we first analyze in sec.[sec - iii ] the properties of individual samples , and show that the disorder on the _ absolute value _ and on the _ phase _ of the tunneling amplitude may have quite different effects on the transmission coefficient of a disordered sample . in particular , while in a clean tunnel junction the phase is unimportant , for a disordered junction it plays a major role in realistically relevant regimes .",
    "we then address in sec.[sec - iv ] the localization length , the sample - independent intrinsic disorder property that determines the lengthscale over which the transmission decays as a function of the sample length .",
    "we show that not only the typical amount of phase fluctuations , but also the _ way _ the phase fluctuates strongly affects the localization length @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , we analyze three different models for phase fluctuations , including the case of correlated disorder , and show three different behaviours for the predicted energy dependence of @xmath4 .",
    "also , we discuss how these differences impact the sample - averaged transmission .",
    "finally , in sec.[sec - v ] we discuss how the proposed models apply in realistic implementations of helical tunnel junctions , and compare our results to the case of a conventional disordered quantum wire .",
    "for a long and clean constriction it has been shown  @xcite that , starting from the 2d bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) model defined on a stripe of width @xmath7 , one can obtain an effective 1d model defined on the basis of the edge modes , which turn out to be coupled via a tunneling amplitude related to their wavefunction overlap .",
    "such an overlap roughly decays exponentially with the transversal width @xmath7 of the junction .",
    "a straightforward way to account for the geometrical disorder due to the profile roughness is to adopt such a basis , and to assume a width  @xmath8 that fluctuates along the longitudinal direction @xmath9 , resulting in a randomly varying tunneling amplitude .",
    "notice that , as is well known , there are in fact two types of tunneling amplitudes , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , related to spin - preserving(p ) and spin - flipping(f ) processes , respectively , both ensuring time - reversal symmetry .  @xcite the model presented here can in principle include both , although we shall be mainly interested in the effects of the first coupling @xmath12 , which is expected to be dominant .",
    "+ furthermore , the disorder arising from the oxides formed when etching the constriction and from the inhomogeneities of the amorphous dielectric can be regarded as a series of randomly distributed electric potential centers , each coupling to the edge state densities in two different ways , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , depending on the transversal distance from the top and bottom edges , and randomly varying along the longitudinal direction  @xmath9 .",
    "+ we describe the helical edge states by four electron field operators , namely @xmath15 for the ( say ) upper edge and @xmath16 for the lower edge , characterized by a linear spectrum dirac hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath17 with @xmath18 denoting the chirality for right- and left- movers , respectively ,  @xcite @xmath19 is the spin component , and @xmath20 indicates the normal ordering .",
    "the most general tunneling terms that preserve time - reversal symmetry are given by @xmath21 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe the randomly varying tunneling amplitudes related to spin - preserving and spin - flipping processes , respectively  @xcite .",

    "the full hamiltonian for the disordered junction thus reads @xmath28 far away from the constriction the helical edge states propagate freely and are eventually injected or absorbed by the 4 metallic electrodes ( see fig.[fig-01 ] ) , each kept at a chemical potential @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "denoting by @xmath31 and  @xmath32 the left and right extremal longitudinal coordinates of the constriction , the system is disorder - free ( @xmath33 ) for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , whereas within the finite length @xmath36 of the constriction region the tunneling amplitudes @xmath37 and the potentials @xmath38 fluctuate randomly along the longitudinal direction @xmath9 . + in ref .",

    "more specifically , each entry of @xmath40 is factorized into a product of two terms , one depending on only the profile of @xmath10 and @xmath41 , and the other depending on only @xmath11 and @xmath42 only . thus ,",
    "if a bias voltage @xmath43 is applied to , say , terminal 2 in fig.[fig-01 ] , the resulting currents entering terminals 1 , 3 and 4 are @xmath44 here @xmath45    \\label{tp - dep}\\\\ t_{f}&= & t_{f}[\\gamma_{f}(x ) ; v_{f}(x ) ]    \\label{tf - dep }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the transmission coefficients related to spin - preserving ( p - sector ) and spin - flipping ( f - sector ) tunneling processes , respectively , and can be operatively determined via eqs.([i1])-([i3])-([i4 ] ) .",

    "@xcite      _ a priori _ , in both sectors @xmath51 , the model is characterized by three real parameters , namely a ( complex ) tunneling amplitude @xmath52 $ ] and a ( real ) potential @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , only _ two _ parameters are sufficient .",
    "indeed we show here below that the potential @xmath53 can be reabsorbed into the phase @xmath54 of the tunneling amplitude , via a gauge transformation @xmath55 , where the renormalised phases read @xmath56 thus , while the potential in eqs.([u ] ) and ( [ u-2 ] ) alone does not couple the two edges directly , it does affect their tunneling term ( [ hsp ] ) .",
    "importantly , the phase @xmath57 depends _ non - locally _ on the related potential @xmath58 . in particular , a constant potential @xmath59 yields a phase @xmath60 that varies _ linearly _ in space , whereas a @xmath61-like potential @xmath62 centered at @xmath63 yields a _ phase - jump _ at @xmath63 , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this implies that different profiles for the phase @xmath54 have to be adopted to account for various types of @xmath66 disorder .",
    "@xcite + a suitable way to prove that the potentials @xmath53 can be gauged away is to exploit the equation of motion for the electron fields obtained in ref .",

    "the factorisation result ( [ m - factorized ] ) , valid for any arbitrary profile of the tunneling amplitudes and potentials , implies the separated dependence of the two coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath46 on the disorder profiles @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively [ see eqs.([tp - dep ] ) and ( [ tf - dep ] ) ] .",
    "this enables us to analyze the effects of disorder in the two sectors @xmath51 separately , without loss of generality . in particular , because the spin - preserving tunneling amplitude is typically bigger then the spin - flipping one , @xmath108 , and because @xmath0 exhibits a richer energy - dependence than @xmath46 ,  @xcite we shall consider henceforth the p - sector , for which the spin index acts as a dummy degeneracy variable .",
    "furthermore , because the potential @xmath109 can be reabsorbed via the gauge transformation ( [ trans - prime ] ) into the phase of the tunneling amplitude [ see eq.([gauge - phase ] ) ] , we shall discuss without loss of generality the effects of disorder of the ( complex ) tunneling amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "we start our analysis by investigating the transmission coefficient of individual disordered samples . to illustrate the effects of disorder , it is first worth recalling the result for the clean junction case , characterised by a constant @xmath110 $ ] over the whole junction length  @xmath111 , as investigated in ref .",
    "[ ] . in that case the transmission coefficient @xmath0 is _ independent _ of the value of the phase  @xmath3 , and depends on only the absolute value @xmath112 of the tunneling amplitude . in particular , while for a short junction ( @xmath113 with @xmath114 ) the transmission coefficient is trivially energy independent , for an elongated junction ( @xmath115 ) the energy @xmath116 determines the crossover from a ` sub - gap ' region ( @xmath117 ) with very low transmission to a ` supra - gap ' region ( @xmath118 ) where transmission is finite and exhibits an oscillatory behavior related to the finite length @xmath111 of the junction . in the limit of an infinitely long junction , @xmath116 would be an actual gap in the spectrum , so that @xmath119 is the evanescent wave decay length associated with such an energy gap .",
    "we thus focus here on the effects of disorder in the more interesting case of an elongated junction @xmath115 .    for this purpose , we perform a coarse graining of the tunnel junction , dividing the length @xmath111 of the tunnel region into a sequence of @xmath120 intervals @xmath121 $ ] ( with @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) , characterized by a size @xmath124 corresponding to the typical disorder fluctuation lengthscale . then",

    "the transmission coefficient  @xmath0 of the disordered sample , obtained from ( [ m - as - a - prod ] ) through eq.([tp - gen ] ) , depends both on the fluctuations strength of the tunneling amplitude and on the lengthscales @xmath111 , @xmath119 and @xmath129 . here",
    "we shall focus on the regime @xmath130 , which is physically more relevant , as we shall discuss later .      in the presence of disorder",
    ", the roles of the absolute value @xmath131 and of the phase @xmath132 can be quite different from those for the clean junction case .",
    "in particular , while in the clean case @xmath0 is independent of the phase , in the disordered case the fluctuations of @xmath132 dramatically affect  @xmath0 .",
    "we illustrate this point with an illuminating example , namely , the case where @xmath12 in each interval @xmath125 are chosen from a gaussian distribution in the complex plane .",
    "then , the absolute value @xmath2 follows the rayleigh distribution and the phase @xmath3 is uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath133 .",
    "we have analyzed independently the effects of these two distributions on the transmission coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "explicitly , fig.[fig - sgl - gamma_1 ] shows the @xmath0 of a disordered sample in the cases where ( i ) @xmath2 is rayleigh - distributed and @xmath3 is kept constant ( solid blue curve ) , and ( ii ) @xmath132 fluctuates uniformly and @xmath2 is constant ( dashed red curve ) . for comparison , the case of a clean junction is described by the thin black curve , and the rayleigh distribution is taken with an average value @xmath134 equal to the absolute value @xmath116 of the clean case .",
    "as one can see , the fluctuations of the absolute value @xmath2 leave essentially unaltered the qualitative features of the clean case . indeed , the particle - hole symmetry @xmath135 of the transmission coefficient is preserved , and the crossover between a low transmission ` sub - gap ' region and a high transmission ` supra - gap ' region is still present , possibly with a slight quantitative change of the ` gap ' @xmath2 and a modification of the @xmath0 oscillations in the supra - gap region . in contrast , the disorder of the phase @xmath3 breaks the particle - hole symmetry of the clean case , and introduces transmission peaks in the ` sub - gap ' region , whose width decreases when @xmath136 increases .",
    "the origin of these peaks can be qualitatively understood in analogy to the case of barriers in quantum interference problems . in the simplest case of a tunneling amplitude with a phase jump in the middle of the junction , for instance",
    ", the two halves of the junction play the role of a series of two barriers , located very close to each other , with equal transmission coefficients ( here determined by @xmath137 ) , but with a difference in the transmission amplitude phases ( here determined by @xmath138 and @xmath77 ) : perfect resonances are then known to arise even when each individual barrier is not perfectly transmitting , provided that the phase difference fulfills specific conditions ( here @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) . in a more general case where phase fluctuations occur at various junction positions and are not necessarily equal to @xmath141 , as in fig.[fig - sgl - gamma_1 ] , peaks do not reach exactly 1 and may occur at different values of energy @xmath77 .",
    "+ the phase disorder thus significantly modifies the clean case scenario , replacing the crossover between the two regions with a sequence of maxima and minima , and breaking the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "$ ] is randomly varying .",
    "the disorder on the absolute value @xmath2 ( solid blue curve ) has different effects than the disorder on the phase @xmath3 ( dashed red curve ) . for comparison",

    "@xmath142 and @xmath143 , corresponding to the regime @xmath144 . ]",
    "while the specific shape of @xmath0 is sample - dependent , the qualitative features described above in fig.[fig - sgl - gamma_1 ] are present in any sample in the same regime of parameters , namely @xmath145 .",
    "the difference in the role of @xmath2 and @xmath3 becomes particularly striking in the regime @xmath146 , where disorder fluctuates over a length scale much smaller than the typical electronic scale characterizing the clean junction at @xmath140 . in this limit",
    "the integral in ( [ hsp ] ) exhibits a slowly varying component [ the electron field @xmath147 and a rapidly fluctuating term [ the tunneling amplitude @xmath10 ] , and the electron probes only the space - averaged disorder @xmath149 , which is a statistical estimate of the distribution average itself .",
    "thus , when only @xmath2 fluctuates , one has @xmath150=\\gamma_p^0 \\exp[i\\phi_p]$ ] and the clean case result is recovered .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath3 fluctuates of about @xmath133 , then for any value of @xmath12 , also @xmath151 is equally likely to occur , so that @xmath152 .",
    "the phase fluctuations completely wash out the tunneling term , so that the transmission becomes energy independent and tends to  1 .",

    "for these reasons , we shall henceforth neglect the disorder on @xmath2 and focus on the phase .",
    "in the next section we show that different models for the phase fluctuations may lead to strongly different results also for the localization length of disordered tunnel junctions .",

    ", such an energy shift can effectively displace the local transmission of that interval from the ` sub - gap ' regime to the ` supra - gap ' regime and viceversa , even when @xmath2 is not fluctuating .",
    "when the sequence of all intervals is now considered , for a value of energy @xmath77 corresponding to the ` sub - gap ' ( ` supra - gap ' ) region of the clean case , a c - lc disordered sample also exhibits intervals in the conducting ` supra - gap ' ( ` sub - gap ' ) regime .",
    "this is the reason why for the blue thin solid curve @xmath202 increases ( decreases ) for @xmath203 ( @xmath204 ) , as compared to the thin dotted black curve for the clean case . at a more formal level ,",
    "this effect stems from the fact that a linearly varying phase @xmath3 results into a space - dependent @xmath92 vector ( [ bpe - def ] ) , so that the matrices @xmath205 and @xmath206 at any two different points do not commute , even within each interval .",
    "space - ordering @xmath86 in eq.([up - expr ] ) is thus crucial in determining the evolution operator @xmath201 , and gives rise to the local energy shift @xmath200 .",
    "in contrast , for piece - wise constant @xmath132 and @xmath205 , space - ordering can be dropped within each interval , and no shift arises .",
    "the energy dependence of the localization length directly impacts sample - averaged quantities . denoting by @xmath207 the average over samples with different disorder realizations , the sample - averaged transmission coefficient  @xmath208 , the ` typical ' transmission coefficient @xmath209 \\quad , \\label{tp - typ - def}\\ ] ] and the transmission fluctuations @xmath210 can be compared with @xmath4  .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig - smp - ave ] for phase fluctuations following the u - g model [ panel a ) ] and the c - lc model [ panel b ) ] .",

    "@xcite furthermore , the fluctuations @xmath213 ( blue dotted line ) are of the order of the average transmission and , as expected for mesoscopic samples , do not decrease with an increasing number of samples . for the u - g model ,",

    "[ fig - smp - ave]a ) as a thin black line as a guide to the eye .",
    "the transmission coefficient reaches 1 and its fluctuations @xmath213 vanish at the energy values for which @xmath4 diverges . for the c - lc model ,",
    "the fluctuations @xmath213 exhibit a local minimum at @xmath140 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - smp - ave]b ) . its origin can be understood in terms of the energy - shift effect @xmath200 that arises in this model and is discussed above . for a given value of @xmath182 , the energy ranges in which @xmath0 is less affected by such disorder - induced shift are small energies @xmath215 and very high energies @xmath216 , where the local transmission is likely to remain in the ` sub - gap ' region and in the `",
    "supra - gap ' region , respectively , despite the fluctuating shift .",

    "we also notice that , while in a single sample the phase fluctuations typically lead to a @xmath0 that is not particle - hole symmetric ( see the red dashed curve in fig.[fig - sgl - gamma_1 ] ) , fig.[fig - smp - ave ] shows that particle - hole symmetry is recovered upon sample averaging .",

    "the behavior of @xmath220 has also been reported ( thin black solid curve ) as a guide to the eye .",
    "the disorder parameter for the c - lc model is @xmath195.,width=302 ]",
    "we now want to discuss the previous results in terms of realistic systems , identifying situations where the three models of phase fluctuations can be applied . as observed in the introduction , in realistic implementations of helical edge state tunnel junctions , disorder has mainly two origins .",
    "one is the presence of roughness in the borders delimiting the constriction , which causes the width @xmath8 of the junction to fluctuate along the longitudinal direction @xmath9 .",
    "we shall refer to that as the ` geometrical disorder ' .",
    "the second origin is the presence of locally fluctuating potentials , due to the oxides arising at the etching process and/or to the amorphous dielectric below the top gate .",
    "we shall refer to the latter as the ` electrical disorder ' .",
    "concerning the geometrical disorder , it is worth mentioning that current lithographic techniques allow us to obtain an extremely precise profile .",
    "thus , although some roughness is ultimately unavoidable due to lithographic resolution ( @xmath221 ) , one can quite reasonably treat the local width @xmath8 as a fluctuating variable that is sharply peaked around its average value @xmath222 [ see fig.[fig - geom - vs - elec]a ) ] . because @xmath8 determines the local absolute value @xmath131 of the tunneling amplitude",
    ", one can fairly claim that the distribution of @xmath131 is also sharply peaked around its average value .",
    "the rayleigh distribution ( i.e. the distribution of the absolute value of a complex gaussian variable ) is not particularly peaked , for its standard deviation is proportional to its average value , @xmath223 , and it overestimates the actual amount of fluctuations of @xmath131 .",
    "nevertheless , even when the fluctuations of @xmath131 are assumed to follow such a distribution , the transmission coefficient turns out to be essentially unaltered with respect to the clean case , as we have shown in sec.[sec - iii ] .",
    "we conclude that , for practical purposes , one can fairly approximate the absolute value as being locked to its average value , @xmath224 , corresponding to the sharply peaked average width . to estimate the amount of phase fluctuations",
    ", one observes that the local tunneling amplitude @xmath10 is related to the overlap integral between the two uncoupled edge states wavefunctions @xmath225 over a local randomly varying area @xmath226 centered around a longitudinal point @xmath9 over the typical roughness lengthscale @xmath129 . because the wavefunctions are of the form @xmath227 where @xmath228 is a _",
    "real _ function that transversally decays , the only contribution to phase fluctuations is roughly @xmath229 , where @xmath230 is the difference between the lengths of the two edge profiles around  @xmath9 [ see fig.[fig - geom - vs - elec]a ) ] . for the helical states the dirac spectrum is centered around @xmath231 , so that for a 1 mev energetic electron one has @xmath232 , while the roughness @xmath233 is limited by a lithographic resolution of 20 nm .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that @xmath234 and that the phase fluctuations due to geometrical disorder are fairly small .",
    "they can be accounted for by either the c - rw model ( with a parameter @xmath235 ) or the c - lc model [ with a parameter @xmath236 . in this",
    "limit small step - like variations and linear variations with a small slope are equivalent . for the above reasons",
    ", we believe that in realistic junctions geometrical disorder due to roughness does not play a major role .    for the electrical disorder",
    "the scenario is richer .",
    "let us consider the random potential @xmath41 , which consists of the sum of various electric potential sources , and denote by  @xmath237 the typical extension range of these potential centers , and by @xmath129 their average distance from each other ( notice that the value of @xmath129 for the electrical disorder can of course differ from the roughness lengthscale mentioned above for the geometrical disorder ) .",
    "there can be two limiting configurations , depicted in panels b ) and c ) of fig.[fig - geom - vs - elec ] : in the case with @xmath238 [ panel b ) ] , the average of the potential over the distance @xmath129 is fairly representative of the potential distribution at such a lengthscale .",
    "thus , in defining a coarse grained disorder one can assign a constant value of the potential to the interval ( denoted by black thick lines ) . in contrast , in the opposite regime @xmath239 [ panel c ) ] the inhomogeneous distribution of strongly peaked potential centers can not be replaced by the averaged potential over @xmath129 . however",
    ", this difference can be reworded in terms of the phase @xmath3 of the tunneling amplitude . indeed , as shown in sec.[sec - iv - a ] , with the gauge transformation ( [ trans - prime ] ) one can eliminate the potential @xmath49 by introducing a renormalized phase @xmath240 of the tunneling amplitude , given by the integral of @xmath109 [ see eq.([gauge - phase ] ) ] .",
    "thus , in the first case @xmath238 one obtains a linearly varying phase [ dashed red line in panel b ) ] , and the c - lc model applies . in the second case , @xmath239 , the phase exhibits jumps at the potentials source centers [ dashed red line in panel c ) ] .",
    "the amount of such phase jumps depends on the typical strength of the potential peaks , @xmath241 .",
    "the situation of sharp and strong peaks ( @xmath198 ) can be described by the u - g model , whereas for weaker peaks one can simply replace eq.([phase - u - g ] ) for the u - g model by a uniform distribution with @xmath242 , similarly to what has been done in the analysis of fig.[fig - sgl - gamma_2 ] .",
    "+     of the width are typically smaller than the average width ( @xmath243 , so that @xmath244 is weakly disordered . however , the difference @xmath245 between opposite profile lengths may cause fluctuations on the phase @xmath3 of the tunneling amplitude . in panels",

    "panels b ) and c ) describe the cases of long and short range potential , respectively , as compared to the typical potential center distance @xmath129 .",
    "the red dashed curves represent the equivalent formulation in terms of the phase of the tunneling amplitude , after applying the gauge transformation equation  ( [ gauge - phase ] ) . ]",
    "_ experimental conditions_. tunnel junctions in qshe can be realized by lateral etching of hgte / cdte  @xcite and inas / gasb  @xcite quantum wells , and lithographic techniques can be exploited to tailor arbitrary shapes .",
    "the presence of the top gate enables one to enter the qshe regime and to tune the fermi level @xmath246 . for constriction widths @xmath247 in the hgte / cdte case , one obtains a tunneling amplitude magnitude @xmath248 .",
    "@xcite these energy values are well below the bulk gap and are experimentally accessed .",
    "@xcite using the value of the fermi velocity @xmath249 ,  @xcite a lengthscale @xmath250 is obtained . for inas / gasb quantum wells , smaller values for @xmath119",
    "may be expected , due to a fermi velocity @xmath251 that is more than one order of magnitude smaller than that in hgte / cdte edge states .",
    "@xcite thus , for an @xmath252 long junction , one has @xmath253 .",
    "the geometrical disorder and the electrical disorder discussed above thus occur over a typical lengthscale @xmath254 , whose value depends on the specific fabrication method .",
    "+      formal analogies arise between the disordered tunnel junction of helical states and the problem of a 1d disordered quantum wire .",
    "indeed the @xmath10 term and the @xmath49 term play the role of backward scattering ( bs ) and forward scattering ( fs ) in a disordered wire , respectively .",
    "there are , however , various aspects that distinguish the problem of a tunnel junction of helical edge states from the case of a quantum wire . in the first instance , far away from the constriction region the helical states eventually separate , enabling one to separately measure the backscattering and the transmitted currents , given by eqs.([i1 ] ) and ( [ i3 ] ) , respectively , for an injection from e.g. terminal 2.@xcite this separation is not possible in a quantum wire .",
    "secondly , while in a quantum wire impurities are typically distributed everywhere , here disorder is effective over only the finite length @xmath111 of the constriction , because topological protection from disorder occurs away from the tunnel junction .",
    "furthermore , in quantum wires the disorder effects should be compared with the disorder - free case , which is a clean conducting wire with a roughly energy independent transmission coefficient . as a consequence ,",
    "only one typical electron lengthscale can compared with the disorder fluctuation lengthscale , namely , the fermi wavelength @xmath255 of a traveling wave in the clean case at the fermi energy , which is of the order a few angstroms .",
    "in contrast , a clean tunnel junction with a uniform tunneling @xmath256 $ ] exhibits a much richer structure .",
    "indeed one can identify the ` sub - gap ' region @xmath257 , characterised by decaying electron waves with a wavelength that takes the minimal value @xmath168 at @xmath140 and diverges at @xmath188 , and the ` supra - gap ' region @xmath258 , characterised by traveling waves with a wavelength decreasing in energy down to a behavior @xmath259 for high energies .",
    "this causes the energy dependence of the clean - case localization length eq.([xi - cl ] ) .",
    "when investigating the disorder effects in a tunnel junction , such rich energy dependence of the clean case becomes crucial .",
    "finally , in a disordered quantum wire , fs and bs terms have the _ same _ physical origin , namely the presence of impurities in the wire , and are associated with the @xmath260 and @xmath261 fourier components of the impurity potential , respectively , so that disorder always involves _ both _ terms .",
    "in contrast , in a tunnel junction @xmath10 is mainly due to the geometrical disorder and @xmath49 is due to the electrical disorder , and we have argued above that the former disorder is significantly less relevant than the latter .",
    "this difference has severe physical implications , which can be described by invoking the gauge transformation ( [ trans - prime ] ) that casts the fs term @xmath262 into the renormalized phase @xmath263 [ see eq.([gauge - phase ] ) ] of a new bs term @xmath264 $ ] .",
    "now , _ if _ the original @xmath12 is a gaussian - distributed bs term , then the new @xmath265 obtained after the gauge is _ also _ a gaussian distributed variable .",
    "the fs term is thus effectively canceled by the local correlation of the original bs term @xmath266 , and does not play any role .",
    "this is indeed the case of a quantum wire .",
    "@xcite however , if the original bs can be considered to be _ not _ disordered , the fs term _ indirectly _ induces a fluctuating bs term @xmath265 , via eq.([trans - prime ] ) .",
    "the non - locality of the gauge transformation ( [ gauge - phase ] ) maps an _ uncorrelated _ disorder on the fs term @xmath262 , @xmath267 , into a _",
    "correlated non - gaussian _ disorder on the bs term @xmath12 , whose space - correlations are related to the distribution parameter @xmath268 of the fs term  @xmath262 .",
    "this effect causes the strikingly different behaviors of the localization length in the u - g and the c - lc models , described by the black solid curve and the red dashed curve in fig.[fig - xi - loc ] .",
    "notice that this phenomenon is essentially different from the more customary case of the anderson model with correlated disorder , where correlations are introduced directly on the disordered potential  @xcite , and is more similar to the case of periodic - on - average systems.@xcite",
    "we have analyzed the effects of disorder on a tunnel junction of helical edge states ( fig.[fig-01 ] ) using an effective 1d model where the tunneling amplitude @xmath269 $ ] is randomly varying along the longitudinal direction of the junction .",
    "the analysis of the transmission coefficient @xmath0 of individual samples has shown that the disorders of the absolute value @xmath2 and of the phase @xmath3 of the tunneling amplitude lead to quite different effects , the latter being typically more relevant in the physical regime @xmath130 , as shown in fig.[fig - sgl - gamma_1 ] .",
    "in particular , in the regime @xmath146 , the fluctuations of @xmath3 can even suppress tunneling strongly , leading to an energy independent transmission coefficient ( see fig.[fig - sgl - gamma_2 ] ) .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the behavior of a clean junction , where the transmission coefficient is independent of the value of the phase .",
    "+ furthermore , we have also shown that , when phase fluctuates by an amount of about @xmath270 , the way the phase fluctuates also becomes important .",
    "in particular , we have analyzed three different models for phase fluctuations ( see fig.[fig - phase - models ] ) , and we have shown that the energy dependence of the localization length @xmath202 is dramatically different for the three cases , as illustrated in fig.[fig - xi - loc ] . furthermore , the sample - averaged transmission , displayed in fig.[fig - smp - ave ] , turns out to be different .",
