    "it is not only one of most imporatant topics in condensed matter physics but also vital to practical applications , such as magnetic field sensors , read heads of hard drives , random access memories @xcite . in general , the large mr is emergent in magnetic materials , such as giant mr ( gmr , mr @xmath0 10@xmath1 % ) in metallic thin films and colossal mr ( cmr , mr @xmath0 10@xmath2 % ) in cr - based chalcogenide spinels as well as mn - based perovskites @xcite . in the past several years",
    ", a series of non - magnetic metals with extreme mr ( xmr ) have been discovered , such as @xmath3 ( @xmath4 = nb and ta , @xmath5 = p and as ) @xcite , cd@xmath6as@xmath7 @xcite , nbsb@xmath7 @xciteand wte@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these discoveries greatly challenge the traditional understanding that the non - magnetic metals usually have a small mr of only about a few percent . most of novel xmr materials exhibit some common features , such as extremely high mobilities @xmath8 , usually @xmath9",
    "1@xmath1010@xmath2 cm@xmath1 v@xmath12 s@xmath12 , and comparable carrier concentrations of electron and hole @xcite . based on these features ,",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of xmr in these materials , including topological protection from backscattering mechanism in dirac and weyl semimetals ( sms ) @xcite , and electron - hole compensation mechanism @xcite .",
    "very recently , the xmr materials are extended to the rare - earth - based material lasb with simple rock - salt structure @xcite .",
    "it shows xmr at 2 k and 9 t ( 0.9@xmath1010@xmath13 % ) .",
    "moreover , metallic lasb exhibits the field - induced upturn behavior in resistivity curve appearing at low temperature , followed by a resistivity plateau .",
    "similar phenomena are also observed in several systems , such as nbp and wte@xmath7 @xcite . although the xmr in lasb and labi have been reported in early works @xcite , the origin of field - induced upturn behavior and resistivity plateau is not clear .",
    "previous study @xcite suggests that the prerequisites for xmr and related field - induced properties seem absent in lasb , such as the inversion symmetry broken as in weyl sms , linear dispersion of band structure near fermi energy level @xmath14 as in dirac sms , and perfect electron - hole compensation satisfying the resonance situation as in wte@xmath7 .",
    "tafti et al proposed that the conducting surface states of a topological insulator protected by time reversal symmetry could be the reason causing these field - induced behaviors in lasb @xcite .",
    "but recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurement suggests that lasb is topologically trivial , no dirac - like surface states are observed @xcite .",
    "moreover , the arpes results also indicate that the carriers in lasb are almost compensated .",
    "thus , it is interesting to study whether electron - hole compensation mechanism is valid to explain these exotic phenomena in lasb .    in order to explore more xmr materials in this family and understand field - induced properties in lasb as well as other xmr materials , here , we report the detailed study on magnetotransport properties and electronic structure of labi single crystals , isostructural to lasb .",
    "we find labi exhibits the xmr behavior , consistent with previous results @xcite .",

    "<S> the discovery of non - magnetic extreme magnetoresistance ( xmr ) materials has induced great interests because the xmr phenomenon challenges our understanding of how a magnetic field can alter electron transport in semimetals . among xmr materials , </S>",
    "<S> the lasb shows xmr and field - induced exotic behaviors but it seems to lack the essentials for these properties . here , we study the magnetotransport properties and electronic structure of labi , isostructural to lasb . </S>",
    "<S> labi exhibits large mr as in lasb , which can be ascribed to the nearly compensated electron and hole with rather high mobilities . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , our analysis suggests that the xmr as well as field - induced resistivity upturn and plateau observed in lasb and labi can be well explained by the two - band model with the compensation situation . </S>",
    "<S> we present the critical conditions leading to these field - induced properties . </S>",
    "<S> it will contribute to understanding the xmr phenomenon and explore novel xmr materials . </S>"
