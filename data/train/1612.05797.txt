    "the redshifted 21 cm line from the epoch of reionization ( eor ) provides numerous astrophysical and cosmological information about the formation and evolution of the first stars and galaxies  @xcite .",
    "many ongoing and forthcoming experiments such as the low frequency array ( lofar ) , the hydrogen epoch of reionisation array ( hera ) , and the square kilometer array ( ska - low ) , are devoted to observing the dense neutral hydrogen gas that traces the cosmic web at redshifts beyond 7 , and will likely detect the 21 cm power spectrum in the near future . it is thus important to develop robust and comprehensive theoretical models that can utilise such information , along with observations from many other wavelengths and facilities , in order to optimally constrain the physical processes driving reionisation .",
    "the recent low value of @xcite integrated optical depth to thomson scattering suggests that the eor may have occurred more suddenly , and at much later times , than what was previously believed  @xcite .",
    "this low value of @xmath2 prefers eor models with late onset and shorter duration .",
    "this , in turn , is expected to have a significant impact on the expected 21 cm signal .",
    "proper modelling of the sources and sinks of ionising photons during the eor is required to accurately model the bubbles and study their sizes and distributions .",
    "this will allow us to connect the observed 21 cm power spectrum with the physical characteristics of the sources and sinks .",
    "there are several major challenges to modeling the eor and its redshifted 21 cm signal which make this a difficult problem .",
    "these requirements include : ( i ) large volumes ( @xmath3 500 mpc ) in order to capture the large scale fluctuations that will be in upcoming 21 cm observations ; ( ii ) high resolution that is sufficient to resolve the ionizing sources and self - shielding systems in sub - kpc scales  @xcite ; ( iii ) accurately tracking the ionizing radiation and feedback processes from the sub - kpc up to mpc scales .",
    "for these reasons , self - consistently simulating the eor represents an immense computational challenge that no current model has been able to fully meet .",
    "nonetheless , great progress has been made in simulating various aspects of the eor , both on small and large scales .",
    "the full radiative transfer simulations ( @xcite ) possess high resolution and are able to propagate the radiation with minimal physical assumption , although they generally can not capture volumes larger than 20 mpc while simultaneously treating the contribution of atomically - cooled halos .",
    "post - processed radiative transfer simulations ( @xcite ) can access larger volumes though they do not account for various feedback effects on galaxies self - consistently .",
    "semi - analytical eor models  @xcite are very successful in studying and constraining the globally averaged astrophysical quantities and parameters during eor  @xcite based on current observations , but the lack of dynamic range prevents them from studying the 21 cm fluctuations .",
    "semi - numerical models ( @xcite ) based typically on quasi - linear density evolution and coarse modeling of the source population can evolve the eor on the largest scales , but use highly parameterised approximations for the source and sink populations .",
    "such semi - numerical models nevertheless they have been shown to reproduce similar reionizaion histories as obtained by radiative transfer simulations ( @xcite )",
    ".    semi - numerical models are thus ideally suited to studying the large - scale ( @xmath4 ) 21 cm power spectrum that will be measured with upcoming radio facilities . however , there are many uncertainties associated with the semi - numerical method .",
    "these include : ( 1 ) the relationship between halo mass and ionizing luminosity ; ( 2 ) the relationship between the large - scale density field and the recombination rate that emerges from small - scale clumping ; and ( 3 ) the condition for a region to be ionized .",
    "while the third uncertainty is purely numerical , the first two provide an opportunity to constrain the astrophysical quantities and parameters based on 21 cm and other eor observations .    in @xcite",
    ", we took the approach of marrying high - resolution radiative hydrodynamic simulations with a semi - numerical model in order to gain some advantages of each , in particular enabling greater physical realism into the parameterised source and sink populations required for the semi - numerical approach . to do so , we derived new parametrizations of the ionization rate @xmath5 and recombination rate @xmath6 , as functions of halo mass , overdensity and redshift , extracted from our high resolution radiative transfer hydrodynamic simulation  @xcite ( hearafter 6/256-rt ) and larger hydrodynamic simulation  @xcite ( hereafter 32/512 ) .",
    "we then implemented these parametrizations into our semi - numerical code simfast21 to identify the ionized regions .",
    "this more realistic modeling essentially replaces the canonical efficiency parameter @xmath7 method in previous semi - numerical eor modeling .",
    "we found that the @xmath5 scales super - linearly with halo mass ( @xmath8 ) in contrast to the typically assumed linear relationship between the efficiency parameter @xmath7 and halo mass .",
    "we showed that using these new parametrizations ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) allows us to simultaneously match various eor key observables with a relatively low escape fraction , independent of halo mass and redshift .",
    "we also found that the @xmath5 boosts the small scale 21 cm power spectrum while @xmath6 suppresses the 21 cm power on large scales during cosmic reionizations .",
    "@xcite thus improved upon the first two major uncertainties in semi - numerical models , namely the ionisation and recombinations .",
    "however , this work still assumed an ionization condition based on the _ instantaneous _ balance between ionisations and recombinations  in other words , if there were instantaneously more ionisations than recombinations , that volume of space was considered fully ionised .",
    "however , this is not physically fully accurate , since the excess ionising photons in such regions would still require some time to fully ionise the hydrogen in that region .",
    "the instantaneous criterion also ignores partial ionizations , effectively throwing away ionising photons . in the limiting case where reionisation proceeds quickly , this is perhaps not a bad approximation , but ideally we aim to relax this instantaneous assumption .",
    "in essence , it is likely that our ionisations were too efficient , which can affect the topology and duration of the eor .    in this paper , we improve upon our previous ionization condition by tracking the actual number of neutral hydrogen atoms , ionising photons , and recombinations .",
    "this leads to a time dependent ionization condition that is analogous to the well - known ionisation balance equation . with this",
    ", it turns out that reionisation occurs more suddenly , as preferred by the recent @xcite constraints .",
    "we compare this to our previous instantaneous eor model @xcite in terms of their bubble sizes , eor history , and 21 cm power spectra .",
    "another aspect for improvement is in parameter constraints . in @xcite",
    ", we constrained to observations essentially by eye , since we only had one free parameter , namely the escape fraction of ionising photons .",
    "however , here we would like to relax the assumptions of @xmath5 that we were previously simply taking from the high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations , and instead constrain the source population characteristics directly from data .",
    "we thus consider a generalised model with three free parameters : the escape photon fraction @xmath9 , the ionising emissivity amplitude @xmath10 ( @xmath5 amplitude ) , and the ionising emissivity - halo mass power dependence @xmath11 ( @xmath5-@xmath12 non - linear power ) .",
    "we then perform a bayesian monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) search in order to constrain these free parameters against various eor observations .",
    "we also determine how these parameter constraints will be improved by upcoming 21 cm observations , thereby providing forecasting for the ongoing and future eor experiments lofar , hera , and ska - low . by including constraints from all such observations , we thus determine how well we can constrain the eor source population as characterised by our three free parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : sims ] , we introduce our previous instantaneous eor model and our new time - integrated model .",
    "we study and compare these models impacts on various eor observables including the 21 cm power spectrum in section[sec : impact ] . in section [ sec : effects ] , we create several eor models to study their effects on the 21 cm power spectrum . in section[sec : calibration ] , we calibrate the time - integrated model to various eor observations .",
    "we perform the 21 cm forecasting in section[sec:21cmforecating ] and draw our concluding remarks in section [ sim : conclusion ] .    throughout this work ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath13cdm cosmology in which @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , a primordial power spectrum index @xmath17 , an amplitude of the mass fluctuations scaled to @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "we quote all results in comoving units , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we use a semi - numerical code simfast21  @xcite , which we briefly review here .",
    "simfast21 simulation begins by generating the density field from a gaussian distribution using a monte - carlo approach .",
    "the generated density field will then be dynamically evolved from linear to non - linear regime by applying the @xcite approximations .",
    "the dark matter halos are generated using the well - known excursion - set formalism . in the standard simfast21 ,",
    "the ionized regions are identified using a similar form of the excursion - set formalism , which is based on a constant efficiency parameter @xmath7 . in the original simfast21 code ,",
    "the ionisation condition simply compares the amount of collapsed dark matter halo @xmath20 to the efficiency parameter @xmath7  any region will be flagged as ionised if : @xmath21 the efficiency parameter @xmath7 is a model free parameter which can be tuned to match some observations .",
    "this condition generates the ionization field , which may be used along with the density field to obtain the 21 cm brightness temperature .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details on this model and the code algorithm .",
    "we now describe our two extensions to simfast21 .",
    "the first was presented in @xcite , which we review next , and incorporates the ionisation and recombination rate parameterisations taken from hydrodynamic simulations , but utilises an instantaneous ionisation condition .",
    "we then describe our further extension here in order to improve the ionisation condition by tracking the neutral fraction in a time - integrated manner",
    ". we will call this the  instantaneous ionisation `` and ' ' time - integrated ionisation \" models .      as described in @xcite",
    ", here we replace the efficiency parameter @xmath7 with direct parameterisations of the ionization rate @xmath5 and recombination rate @xmath6 as functions of halo mass @xmath12 , overdensity @xmath22 , and redshift @xmath23 , taken from our 6/256-rt and 32/512 simulations .",
    "our best - fit non - linear ionization rate @xmath5 parametrization takes the following form : @xmath24 where @xmath25s@xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "meanwhile , we parameterise the recombination rate as : @xmath30^{4 } } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath31@xmath32s@xmath26 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "our ionisation condition is taken to be @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the escape photon fraction ; cells satisfying this criterion are considered fully ionised , otherwise they are fully neutral .    using this model ,",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that one can match simultaneously several eor key observables , such as  @xcite optical depth ,  @xcite ionizing emissivity and  @xcite filling factor measurement , by only a constant @xmath38 independent of halo mass or redshift .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for more details about the model and these new parametrizations .",
    "the model in  @xcite ( our instantaneous eor model ) has several drawbacks .",
    "first , the ionization condition , equation  , is an instantaneous criterion which compares the escaped ionization rate @xmath39 with the recombination rate @xmath6 , instead of comparing the actual numbers of ionising photons to that of recombinations .",
    "second , the ionization condition , equation  , assumes maximum recombination rate @xmath6 from all cells / regions as they were fully ionised .",
    "to improve on these , we modify the ionisation condition to account for the evolving neutral hydrogen fraction , which allows us to account for the existing number of hydrogen atoms in each region as well as to compute the recombination based on the current ionised fraction .",
    "hence we now employ a time dependent integral ionisation condition : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 all of above quantities are defined within the spherical region volume ( v ) specified by the excursion set - formalism . for a given volume v",
    ", the @xmath43 is the ionization fraction , n is the number density of halos , @xmath44 is the total number of hydrogen , the rion is the total number of ionising photons from all sources being emitted in time interval dt , and rrec is the maximum number of recombinations during that time .    the left hand side ( lhs ) of our new ionization condition ( eq .  [ eq : new_con ] ) represents the actual number of escaped ionising photons being emitted in @xmath45 .",
    "the first term of the right hand side ( rhs ) of this condition is the actual number of recombinations occurring during @xmath45 in regions with an ionization fraction of @xmath43 .",
    "this term then tracks the exact number of recombinations even from partially ionised regions with @xmath46 .",
    "this recombination term has no effect at early times of eor when the universe is completely neutral , but becomes the dominant sink for ionising photons at late stages of the eor  @xcite .",
    "the second term of the rhs of equation   denotes the total number of neutral hydrogen in the simulation box . at early eor stages , the escaped ionising photons ( lhs )",
    "fights only with the neutral hydrogen term @xmath47 . as the eor proceeds",
    ", the neutral hydrogen term becomes less significant , and the recombinations start to play the leading role in forestalling reionisation . hence this provides a more physically motivated ionization condition , in a similar form to the standard ionization balance equation .",
    "the condition is clearly time - dependent , unlike the instantaneous ionisation model for which the ionisation condition could be evaluated independently at each time - step .",
    "thus our new scheme can be sensitive to the choice of the time - step @xmath45 used to perform the integration .",
    "for instance , a larger @xmath48 will result in more ionising photons and also more recombinations .",
    "this then leads to a wrong evolving ionization balance .",
    "we have conducted convergence tests to determine that @xmath49 provides a numerically - converged answer to within @xmath50 .",
    "our new method thus requires higher computational expenses to evolve the ionisation state forward .",
    "we will explore possible variations of the ionisation condition from equation   in  [ sec : effects ] , to study their impact on the 21 cm power spectrum .",
    "it turns out , as we will show , that the instantaneous ionisation condition results in more extended reionisation history , while our new time - integrated condition yields more sudden reionisation .",
    "next , we will investigate their differences in terms of the eor history , topology , and the 21 cm power spectrum .",
    "we use the full model in  @xcite as our fiducial  instantaneous \" reionisation model .",
    "this model uses equation to identify the ionized regions with @xmath51 in a large volume box of @xmath52  mpc and a number of cells @xmath53 .",
    "we have shown that this model matches various observations of the eor including the @xcite optical depth @xmath54 . using the same density field boxes and halo catalogues , we run our new time - integrated reionisation model with parameters calibrated against various eor key observations ( see section  [ sec : calibration ] ) , including the new @xcite optical depth .",
    "the two models are tuned to different @xmath55 values , but we do our 21 cm comparison at a given neutral fraction since it has been shown that the 21 cm power spectrum shape is more sensitive to the neutral fraction ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "we thus begin by comparing the instantaneous and time - integrated models differences in terms of their global neutral fraction history .       constraints as compiled by @xcite .",
    "its quite clear that all models are consistent with the observational constraints by @xcite .",
    "differences between models are explained in the text . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : eorhistory ] shows the global reionisation history produced by our two fiducial models , instantaneous and time - integrated , compared to the neutral fraction constraints obtained by @xcite via a compilation from various observables .",
    "we immediately see that the green line showing the new time - integrated ionisation condition shows a more sudden transition from fully ionised to fully neutral . meanwhile , the blue line from our old instantaneous condition results in a more extended reionisation epoch .",
    "nonetheless , in both cases , reionization occurs in our two models within observational constraints ( light - red shaded areas ) .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that , unlike a few years ago when the canonical redshift for the end of reionisation was regarded as @xmath56 , current constraints from both observations and models favors the end of reionisation to occur at @xmath57 or perhaps a bit higher .",
    "this plot already shows that accounting for the neutral gas through comparing the number of neutral atoms and ionising photons ( equation  ) versus comparing instantaneous rates ( equation  ) has a significant impact on the reionization history . the time - integrated model is qualitatively more compatible with the picture that has been suggested by recent @xcite constraints that favours sudden eor scenarios .",
    "we emphasize the fact that if we tune the time - integrated model optical depth to match the instantaneous model optical depth ( @xmath58 ,  @xcite ) , the time - integrated model will require higher @xmath37 and shift reionization towards higher redshifts , but nevertheless the reionization history shape will remain sudden as shown later in figure  [ fig : xhitaucons ] .",
    "we will come back to this point later in ",
    "[ sec : tau_constraints ] .    from figure",
    "[ fig : eorhistory ] , we also see that both models instantaneous and time - integrated reionize the universe earlier than the 6/256-rt simulation . as discussed before in  @xcite , the small box size ( 6 h@xmath26 mpc ) of 6/256-rt does not capture the large scale fluctuations that give rise to the most massive halos that provide a significant fraction of reionising photons .",
    "hence at a fixed optical depth , it is expected that the 6/256-rt might reionize the universe much later than the time - integrated model due to the box size limitations .",
    "an informative way to examine these models is by viewing light cones , as shown in figure  [ fig : lightcones ] .",
    "these have been constructed by projecting the ionisation state within the simulation volume along a specific line - of - sight , evolving with redshift .",
    "figure  [ fig : lightcones ] confirms that our previous model ( the full model of  @xcite ) produces a more extended eor scenario that corresponds to an early onset and a very late end with a duration of @xmath59 . unlike the instantaneous model , figure  [ fig : lightcones ] also shows that our new model ( equation  ) yields a sudden reionization scenario where the eor starts very late ( once @xmath60 ) and ends ( when @xmath61 drops below 10@xmath62 ) very quickly within a duration of @xmath63 .",
    "more strikingly , it also shows that the time - integrated eor model produces larger ionized bubbles while the instantaneous model yields many ionized bubbles of smaller sizes .",
    "this can further be quantified by studying their differences in terms of the ionization field power spectra .",
    "it is useful to compare the models at a specific neutral fraction , since this best illustrates the difference in topology .",
    "figure  [ fig : ion_maps ] compares our instantaneous and time - integrated models in terms of their ionization maps when the eor is half - way through , i.e. with a globally - averaged @xmath64 .",
    "these ionization maps show the spatial distribution of the large and small ionised bubbles ( black regions ) over 300 mpc scales . from figure",
    "[ fig : ion_maps ] , we see that the instantaneous model produces many small bubbles more uniformly distributed across the ionization map .",
    "this shows that the eor in the instantaneous model proceeds from small scales , and the ionising photons are able to reionise locally everywhere .",
    "this is because the instantaneous ionisation rate can easily exceed the recombination rate ( see equation  ) on small scales when neglecting the local neutral hydrogen content .    in contrast",
    ", the time - integrated model ionization map shows very large bubbles .",
    "this may be explained by interpreting the time - integrated model ionization condition ( equation  ) . as noted earlier , at high redshifts when",
    "the universe is neutral ( @xmath65 ) , the recombination term can be neglected . in this case",
    ", the time - integrated model only compares the escaped ionising photons with the total number of neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "this condition dominates until the region becomes partially ionised . at that point",
    ", recombinations will start to occur because of the nonzero ionisation fraction @xmath43 , but still this region is now less neutral , which will allow more rapid ionisation .",
    "however , different forms of ionization condition yield very different hi fluctuations ( see  [ sec : effects ] ) .",
    "in general , the sources and sinks are occurring within the regions that are densest and thus contain the most number of neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "the high density causes the ionising photons to be ineffective at ionising local regions , until such time as significant ionisations happen , which then rapidly ionise the surrounding regions .",
    "figure  [ fig : pkxi ] shows the ionization field power spectra of our fiducial models at different stages of reionization when the universe is 25% , 50% and 75% reionized .",
    "these neutral fractions correspond to z=8.0,8.75,9.5 and z= 7.75,8.0,8.25 as obtained by the instantaneous and time - integrated models respectively .",
    "this is computed as follows : @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "the time - integrated model produces more power on large scales by 1 - 1.2 order of magnitude and less power on small scales by a factor of 2 - 3 , at fixed ionization fraction , as compared to the instantaneous model .",
    "this is consistent with the qualitative impression from the ionisation maps in figure  [ fig : ion_maps ] .",
    "we further see that the large scale ionization power spectrum , obtained by the time - integrated eor model , peaks at @xmath3 75mpc which corresponds to the characteristic size of the bubbles as seen in the maps in figure  [ fig : ion_maps ] .",
    "the difference particularly on large scales is substantial , which shows the importance of accounting for the existing neutral hydrogen content in the ionization condition ( i.e. the second term of equation  ) .",
    "since the fluctuations in the ionisation field drive the 21 cm brightness temperature , we expect to see similar differences in the 21 cm power spectra , which we examine next .",
    "using the ionization fields of these models , we now compute our eor key observable which is the 21 cm power spectrum . assuming that the spin temperature is much higher than the cmb temperature",
    ", the 21 cm brightness temperature takes the following form : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the comoving gradient of the line of sight component of the comoving velocity . using this equation , it is straightforward to create the 21 cm brightness temperature boxes from which we compute the 21 cm power spectrum as follows : @xmath69 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pk21 ] shows the 21 cm power spectrum of the instantaneous and time - integrated models at neutral fractions of 25% , 50% and 75% .",
    "mimicking the ionization field power spectrum , the time - integrated model produces more power on large scales by 1 - 1.2 order of magnitude at fixed ionization fraction , as to that of the instantaneous model .",
    "likewise , the time - integrated model also produces slightly more power on small scales by a factor of 1.2 - 1.5 as compared with the instantaneous eor model .",
    "this difference is less than when comparing the ionization field power spectra , which comes from the contribution of the density field to the 21 cm power spectrum ",
    "small regions with high local density ( high recombinations ) remain neutral , and hence they do not contribute much to the small - scale fluctuations in 21 cm power .",
    "we also compare our 21 cm power spectra to a similar semi - numerical model by  @xcite that has been calibrated with ly@xmath70 and cmb data .",
    "the semi - numerical models by @xcite adopts the standard efficiency parameter ( @xmath7 ) approach similar to our classic eor model ( yellow in fig  [ fig : pk21 ] ) from  @xcite .",
    "we choose to compare with the very late model in  @xcite ( red in fig  [ fig : pk21 ] ) that is tuned to match the @xcite optical depth , consistent with the optical depth produced by our time - integrated model .",
    "the ionization histories of @xcite and our time - integrated model are very different even though they obtain @xmath71 neutral fraction at the same redshift .",
    "for instance , our time - integrated model produces @xmath72 at z=8.25,8.0,7.75 whereas @xcite model finds @xmath73 at z=10.0,8.0,7.0 .",
    "regardless of this difference in these models reionization histories , their 21 cm power spectra are generally similar .",
    "we find that both models produce a similar shape of the 21 cm power spectrum particularly during the intermediate and final stages of reionization .",
    "the minor difference in their amplitudes is due to using our @xmath5-@xmath6 versus the standard @xmath7 approach .",
    "this can be clearly seen when comparing our classic eor model with @xcite model in figure  [ fig : pk21 ] .",
    "we see both models produce the same power on small scales while their difference on large scales might be from the difference in the density field and neutral fractions .",
    "this confirms our previous findings that using the non - linear ionization power , via our @xmath5-@xmath6 approach , boosts the 21 cm power spectrum as compared to models adopting the standard efficiency parameter method ( classic and @xcite models ) .",
    "this shows that our time - integrated model , that is calibrated to match various eor key observables , produces similar 21 cm power spectrum as obtained by other semi - numerical models that have been calibrated to match ly@xmath70 and cmb data .",
    "the future 21 cm observations might be able to discriminate between these models power spectra .    in summary , we have compared the instantaneous and time - integrated models in terms of their eor history , topology , and their 21 cm power spectra .",
    "we have found that the time - integrated model produces large hi bubbles while the instantaneous model produces more small hi bubbles .",
    "the time - integrated model yields a large scale 21cm / ionization power spectrum that is higher by 1 order of magnitude as compared with the instantaneous model .",
    "we have seen that the ionization condition ( equation  ) results in large bubbles which boost the amount of power on large scales .    .",
    "different colors represent different ways to treat the local fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen density while different line styles corresponds to different recombinations terms , as explained by the legend and text .",
    "it is evident that the recombinations are subdominant in determining the large scale 21 cm power spectrum .",
    "it is also shown models ( red ) , that track the neutral fraction from partially ionized regions , yield a very high 21 cm power spectrum on large scales . ]",
    "the large differences in the 21 cm power spectrum ( figure  [ fig : pk21 ] ) between the instantaneous and time - integrated models show that the 21 cm power spectrum is highly sensitive to the physical assumptions used .",
    "there are two main differences between these models : first , the ionisation condition now accounts for the number of hydrogen atoms , and second , the recombination is now done accounting for partial ionisation .",
    "we believe our new model is more physically - motivated and realistic , but we would like to understand exactly how these changes individually impact the 21 cm power spectra .",
    "we therefore consider the various possible combinations between @xmath6 and @xmath44 to create several models with different ionization condition .",
    "we also consider models neglecting recombination altogether to analyse the impact of recombinations as we did in @xcite , only with our new time - integrated model .",
    "more specifically , we keep the lhs of equation   ( @xmath5 term ) same and vary the rhs terms to create the following models :    * full - nh - full - rrec ( * fnh - frrec * ) : @xmath74 . * full - nh - partial - rrec ( * fnh - prrec * ) : @xmath75 . * full - nh - no - rrec ( * fnh - nrrec * ) : @xmath44 . *",
    "partial - nh - full - rrec ( * pnh - frrec * ) : @xmath76 .",
    "* partial - nh - partial - rrec ( * pnh - prrec * ) : @xmath77 . * partial - nh - no - rrec ( * pnh - nrrec * ) : @xmath78 . * no - nh - full - rrec ( * nnh - frrec * ) : @xmath79 . * no - nh - partial - rrec ( * nnh - prrec * ) : @xmath80 .",
    "the time - integrated model is represented here by ionization condition of * pnh - prrec * whereas the instantaneous model uses that of * nnh - frrec*. the others are variants on these .",
    "to illustrate the differences in the 21 cm power spectrum , we use the same density field and halo catalogues generated within a simulation run of a box size 75 mpc and n = 140@xmath81 .",
    "we have shown previously ( figure 8 in  @xcite ) that the numerical volume convergence of our simulated 21 cm power spectrum is excellent at all redshifts down to a box size of 75 mpc , hence , we expect the same 21 cm power spectrum for larger simulation volumes .",
    "the reionisation history produced by these models vary , so as before we choose to make our 21 cm power spectrum comparison at a fixed neutral fraction .",
    "figure  [ fig : pk21models ] shows the 21 cm power spectrum produced by different models at 50% neutral fraction as explained above .",
    "first , we see that all these variants result in virtually the same 21 cm power spectrum on small scales .",
    "this reiterates our previous finding in  @xcite that using a non - linear ionisation rate @xmath5 boosts the 21 cm power spectrum by a similar amount regardless of whether one accounts for recombinations or not , and further shows that accounting for the neutral hydrogen atoms does not alter this conclusion .",
    "more significant differences are evident at large scales for the 21 cm power spectrum .",
    "models starting with full @xmath82 ( * fnh- * ) produce 21 cm power spectra with the same shape and amplitude on all scales ( i.e. all the blue lines overlap ) , and likewise for models with partial or no @xmath82 ( * pnh- * and * nnh- * ) .",
    "this demonstrates that recombinations are subdominant for determining the large - scale 21 cm power spectrum .",
    "it is clear that the * nh * term plays a major role in boosting / suppressing the large scale 21 cm power spectrum .",
    "this means that semi - numerical models must carefully account for the local number density of neutral hydrogen for a proper prediction of the expected signal .    from figure",
    "[ fig : pk21models ] , we see the clear trend that models that do not account for the existing neutral hydrogen atoms ( * nnh- * models such as the instantaneous model ) have lower 21 cm power spectrum on large scales . furthermore , models that use the total number of hydrogen atoms ( * fnh- * models ) at each time - step regardless of the ionization fraction show 21 cm power spectra that is slightly higher on large scales as compared to * nnh- * models .",
    "this is due to the presence of weak hi fluctuations by following only the density field ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "however , models , that use the ionization history of cells to track the neutral hydrogen atoms from partially ionised regions ( * pnh- * models such as the time - integrated model ) , show a very high 21 cm power spectrum on large scales as opposed to the * nnh- * and * fnh- * models .",
    "this comes from the fact that the the * pnh- * models account for a strong hi fluctuations by following the density field ( @xmath84 ) and ionization field ( @xmath85 ) both .",
    "this shows that , at given neutral fraction , the large scale 21 cm power spectrum is highly influenced by the way in which we account for the fluctuations in the local neutral hydrogen density .    in the next section",
    ", we will discuss the calibration of the time - integrated model against various eor key observables and test how well the ongoing / upcoming 21 cm observations will further constraints our free parameters .",
    "we now focus on our favoured time - integrated reionisation model , which includes all our new physics implementations .",
    "previously , the parametrization of @xmath5 ( equation  ) was obtained from our small - volume high - resolution radiative transfer hydrodynamic simulation ( 6/256-rt ) .",
    "however , the small volume of this simulation makes it subject to uncertainties since , as we saw in figure  [ fig : eorhistory ] , the ionisation history of this simulation is significantly delayed by its small volume . here",
    ", we adopt a more general form for @xmath5 , and determine whether existing eor measurements can calibrate our source model , and thereby provide constraints on the nature of reionising sources .    to this end , we here consider a more generalized model with the following three free parameters :    * @xmath37 is the volume - averaged photon escape fraction .",
    "* @xmath86 is the ionising emissivity amplitude , which scales the amount of ionising emissivity ( @xmath5 ) equally across the halo mass range at a given redshift .",
    "* @xmath87 is ionising emissivity - halo mass power dependence , which quantifies the @xmath5-@xmath12 slope .",
    "we will constrain these three parameters against various eor observations and compare with the values found from fitting to the 6/256-rt simulation , using a bayesian mcmc approach .",
    "recall that the time - integrated model identifies the ionised regions using a time dependent ionization condition ( equation  ) , that tracks the exact recombinations and neutral hydrogen atoms by following the reionization history .",
    "the reionization history , in this model , is numerically well converged for @xmath88 . with these requirements ,",
    "the model becomes more computationally expensive to run , but nevertheless , is feasible for independent large volume runs .",
    "however , sampling the full mcmc space requires at least @xmath89 simulation realizations , which becomes infeasible .",
    "hence we precompute a grid of models spanning the full prior space , and then do a trilinear interpolation to obtain the observables for any given parameter combination .",
    "this sacrifices some accuracy but makes the computation feasible .",
    "we note that @xcite developed an analysis pipeline , mc , that directly links their semi - numerical model 21cmfast  @xcite to a bayesian routine cosmohammar  @xcite to constraining their free parameters .",
    "however , their ionisation condition did not include recombinations through the time integral method which they developed in @xcite , and instead used a standard efficiency parameter ( @xmath7 ) approach .",
    "along with lower resolution of @xmath90 2 mpc , these simplifications enabled them to run their semi - numerical model fully within an mcmc scheme .",
    "we choose a cell size of 0.375 h@xmath26 mpc and a box size @xmath91 mpc , giving @xmath92 cells per side .",

    "the improvement to be noted here is the reduction of the uncertainties on these parameters relative to the previous case without 21 cm data .",
    "for lofar ( green shaded area ) , we see that the 21 cm observations do nt provide tight constraints due to large uncertainties as seen in figure  [ fig:21cmmock ] .",
    "essentially , mildly constraining the large - scale power provides little information on the ionisation sources that drive reionisation .",
    "in contrast , hera ( blue ) and ska ( red ) provide quite tight constraints on the free parameters .",
    "note that the scale of the posteriors is substantially reduced relative to our previous plots in order to enhance visibility .",
    "hence future 21 cm data alone can already independently constrain reionising sources , without adding in any other observations .",
    "interestingly , there is almost no difference between the ska and hera constraints .",
    "this arises because the parameter constraints are predominantly driven by the larger scales , and hera and ska provide similar constraints on the power spectrum for scales @xmath143  mpc .    comparing the 21 cm constraints with constraints obtained from combining several eor key observables , we find that constraining to 21 cm observations yield smaller parameter errors .",
    "this can be clearly seen when comparing the 1-@xmath105 level of @xmath37 and @xmath86 found by constraining to the 21 cm observations ( fig  [ fig:21cmnoall ] ) versus to the combined eor sample ( sfr , @xmath114 , @xmath110 ) ( fig  [ fig : allcons ] ) .",
    "however , it is evident that the 21 cm future observation can constrain the @xmath37 tighter than the current eor key observables .    in previous work by  @xcite",

    "previous semi - numerical models , based on the excursion set formalism , have pointed out a violation in the photon number conservation . in @xcite , the authors found that their semi - numerical model loses about 20% photons .",
    "they have argued that this photon loss arises from ionized bubbles overlapping , which they compensated by boosting the efficiency parameter @xmath7 .",
    "more recent work by @xcite have developed a monte carlo model of bubble growth to resolve the photon conservation problem in their semi - numerical model .",
    "although their bubble growth model did nt resolve the problem completely , nevertheless improvements have been achieved and they have demonstrated that the problem comes from the fact that the excursion set - based models use the average mass of the bubbles rather than tracking the actual mass of sources and bubble local density fluctuations .        however , there are two methods to flag the spherical regions as ionized in the excursion set - formalism .",
    "the first is to flag the whole cells in the bubble ( whole flagging ) whereas the second is to flag only the center cell of the bubble ( center flagging ) .",
    "we next use these two methods to verify the photon conservation in our time - integrated eor model .",
    "we would expect that , during time interval @xmath145 , the total number of escaped ionizing photons ( @xmath146 ) minus the total number of recombinations ( @xmath147 ) should be equal to the number of ionizations in the neutral hydrogen atoms ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "in other words , the successful photons that manage to escape from the interstellar medium ( corrected by @xmath37 ) and from high density regions along the way ( subtracted by @xmath147 ) should be equal to the total number of neutral atoms that have been ionized during time @xmath145 .",
    "we can write the photon conservation ratio as follows : @xmath149 where @xmath150 . this ratio should be equal to unity for an ideal photon conserving model .",
    "however , the ratio can be less than unity when the universe is highly ionized .",
    "we then apply this ratio to the two methods , whole flagging versus center flagging , to check the photon conservation problem in both .",
    "we note that center flagging scheme requires about 20% more ionising photons to match the reionization history obtained by whole flagging method .",
    "we then adjust the @xmath37 in two methods to reproduce identical reionization history ( identical @xmath110 ) while keeping other parameters fixed .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pho_con ] .",
    "we plot the photon conservation ratio for the two methods , whole flagging ( green solid line ) and center flagging ( green dashed line ) with the reionization history ( blue solid line ) .",
    "we find that the center flagging scheme under - uses photons during all reionization redshifts , even after reionization ( z @xmath151 8) , which might partly explain the need for higher @xmath37 with this method .",
    "the photon loss in the whole flagging scheme agrees qualitatively with center flagging at higher redshifts when the universe is almost neutral .    as reionization proceeds ,",
    "the whole flagging starts to over - use photons and ionizes more neutral atoms than expected .",
    "the photon excess / loss in the two methods are clearly redshift dependent . in the center flagging method ,",
    "the photon loss is by a factor of @xmath3 3,7,20 at z= 7.75 , 9.25 , 11 respectively .",
    "the whole flagging scheme shows photon loss",
    "( under - using photons ) at high redshifts and photon excess ( over - using photons ) at the end of reionization",
    ". at high redshifts , the photon loss , in the whole flagging , is by a factor of @xmath3 2,4,7 at z= 8.75,9,11 respectively .",
    "this shows that , at high redshifts , the photon loss , in the whole flagging method , is less by a factor of @xmath3 2,3 as compared with center flagging method . at z=8.5 ( @xmath152 0.9 ) ,",
    "the whole flagging method satisfies the photon conservation condition as the ratio becomes unity , but the ratio does not converge at unity afterwards .",
    "after this point , the whole flagging scheme starts to overuse photons increasingly by a large amount till the end of reionization .",
    "we find the photon excess is about 10% at z=8.4 and 70% at z=7.75 ( end of reionization ) .",
    "we note that all our eor models adopts the whole flagging method .",
    "this shows that our constrained photon escape fractions @xmath37 are , in fact , over - estimated by the photon excess associated with the whole flagging method .",
    "all our previous @xmath37 estimations can be corrected and lowered by 10% up to 70% depending on redshifts .",
    "the photon loss / excess evolution in redshift suggests that the @xmath37 might be required to change with redshift in order to preserve photon number conservation as a temporary solution .",
    "we have improved our simfast21 semi - numerical code for computing the eor on large scales by incorporating a more physically - motivated criterion for determining whether a region of space is ionised , as well as integrating our framework into a full mcmc parameter search framework so we can forecast how well current and future observations can constrain the physical properties of the sources driving reionisation .",
    "we have calibrated our new model to various current observations of the eor , namely the @xcite sfr observations , the @xcite optical depth measurements , and the @xcite @xmath101 data .",
    "we also compared our new eor model to our previous eor model in @xcite in terms of their eor history , bubble sizes , and 21 cm power spectra .",
    "we further studied variations in the 21 cm fluctuations produced by all possible variants of our ionization conditions .",
    "we then presented a robust mcmc analysis to constrain our generalized source model s free parameters against current eor observations .",
    "we used the well - calibrated eor model to predict the 21 cm power spectrum for the future eor array experiments ska , hera , and lofar .",
    "we show how the future 21 cm observations are important for complementing the existing eor current observations in order to tightly estimate the astrophysical parameters of eor sources .",
    "our key findings are as follows :    * the time - integrated eor model produces reionization that starts fairly late ( z@xmath312 ) and ends very rapidly z@xmath37.5 . comparing to the instantaneous eor model , the time - integrated eor model reionizes the universe earlier by @xmath153 , as shown in figure  [ fig : eorhistory ] .",
    "although the reionization is not much delayed , the reionization history evolution ( shape ) is remarkably different due to implementing different ionisation condition in each model ( equation  [ eq : inst ] versus equation  [ eq : new_con ] ) . *",
    "the time - integrated eor model produces very large bubbles as compared with the instantaneous eor model , and fewer small bubbles .",
    "this difference is clearly shown in their evolving hi maps ( figure  [ fig : lightcones ] ) and the ionization field ( figure  [ fig : ion_maps ] ) . *",
    "the time - integrated eor model produces a larger ionization field power spectrum on large scales by 1 - 1.2 orders of magnitude , and lower ionization field power spectrum on small scales by a factor of 2 - 3 as compared with the instantaneous eor model , at various stages of the eor ( figure  [ fig : pkxi ] ) . * likewise , the time - integrated eor model yields a 21 cm power spectrum that is higher by 1 - 1.2 order of magnitude on large scales , and by @xmath1541.2 - 1.5 on small scales versus instantaneous eor model at various global neutral fractions ( figure  [ fig : pk21 ] ) . * comparing to a similar semi - numerical model by @xcite , the time - integrated eor model produces the same shape of the 21 cm power spectrum particularly during the intermediate and final stages of the reionizations ( figure  [ fig : pk21 ] ) .",
    "there is a minor difference in the amplitude of the 21 cm power spectrum due to using our @xmath5-@xmath6 versus the standard efficiency approach .",
    "* by considering all possible combinations between the hydrogen atoms and recombination terms in the ionization condition , we showed that recombinations are subdominant in determining the 21 cm power spectrum particularly on large scales ( figure  [ fig : pk21models ] ) . the 21 cm power spectrum amplitude and shape are highly sensitive to accounting for the amount of and fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen density .",
    "this means semi - numerical models must carefully account for the neutral hydrogen to robustly predict the expected 21 cm signal .",
    "* the @xcite sfr observations provide tight constraints on the ionizing emissivity amplitude @xmath86 and the slope of the @xmath5-m@xmath155 relation @xmath87 , but provide no constraint on the photon escape fraction @xmath37 ( figure  [ fig : sfrcons ] ) .",
    "* the recent @xcite optical depth value @xmath156 poorly constrains our model parameters ( figure  [ fig : taucons ] ) .",
    "this can further be seen in figure  [ fig : xhitaucons ] in which changing the @xmath37 from 0.2 - 0.8 , for fixed @xmath87 and @xmath86 values , results in @xmath110=0.058 - 0.071 consistent with the 1-@xmath105 level of recent @xcite measurements .",
    "although the degeneracy level is high among these parameters , the data slightly prefers models with lower values of @xmath37 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . *",
    "similar to the @xmath110 constraints , the @xcite @xmath157 measurements at a post - reionization epoch ( @xmath100 ) poorly constrain our model parameters in the selected prior range , but there is also a mild tendency towards lower values @xmath37 , @xmath86 and @xmath87(figure  [ fig : nioncons ] ) . * combining all of sfr , @xmath110 and @xmath101 together results in tighter parameter constraints , as seen in figure  [ fig : allcons ] . the @xmath86 and @xmath87 here",
    "follow the previous constraints by the sfr observations , but combining these measurements yields better escape fraction constraints of @xmath158 , though still not very tight .",
    "the parameters determined directly from the full hydrodynamic simulations analysed in @xcite are consistent with these constraints . * using the well - calibrated time - integrated eor model",
    ", we predict the 21 cm power spectrum at different redshifts ( @xmath135 ) for several constructed radio array designs , namely ska , hera , and lofar ( figure  [ fig:21cmmock ] ) . while lofar does not provide strong constraints except at the largest scales , future experiments",
    "will tightly constrain the 21 cm power spectrum to smaller scales that can better constrain the reionising source population . * using the 21 cm mock observations alone to constrain our model free parameters , our mcmc technique is able to recover perfectly the input model parameters for ska and hera as seen in figure  [ fig:21cmnoall ] , and these data by themselves can provide fairly tight constraints on all our astrophysical parameters .",
    "* by adding current eor observations ( sfr , @xmath110 , @xmath157 ) to the 21 cm mock observations , we find that all experiments recovers the input model parameter accurately and the parameters error are futher improved .",
    "this illustrates how future 21 cm observations can complement and substantially improve upon existing eor observations in order to more tightly constrain the emissivity of eor sources and their relationship to the underlying halo population .",
    "* we find that photon conservation is sub - optimal owing to the way the excursion set formalism is generically implemented in current semi - numerical codes , including simfast21 .",
    "the root difficulty is that cells are treated as fully neutral or fully ionised , with no possibility of intermediate ionisation levels .",
    "while some tuning could be done to minimise the problem , a robust solution likely lies in replacing the excursion set - formalism with a proper photon - conserving radiative transfer approach .",
    "we leave this for future work",
    ".    the simfast21-mcmc platform developed here will be applicable for a wide range of eor forecasting science cases . by robustly incorporating all the current observables within an mcmc framework and being able to straightforwardly incorporate new data",
    ", we are building the tools necessary to optimally connect future redshifted 21 cm power spectrum from the eor to physical quantities associated with the population of reionising sources .",
    "such a framework can be used to explore and constrain exotic source populations such as mini - quasars or population  iii stars , as well as to potentially extend to multi - tracer cross - correlation approaches .",
    "the most immediate hurdle will be to develop a more robust yet still fast radiative transfer method that conserves photons , so we can more reliably assess the obtained source population parameters .",
    "there is much exciting work to be done as we continue to prepare for the 21 cm eor era .",
