    "the evolution of large mass - ratio binaries has been a particularly active focus of research in the gravity community in recent years .",
    "this work has been motivated in part by the promise of astrophysical extreme mass ratio inspirals ( or `` emris '' ) as important sources for low - frequency gravitational - wave detectors , but also because this is a limit of the general relativistic two - body problem that can in principle be solved with high precision . by treating the mass ratio of the system as a small parameter , the tools of black hole perturbation theory can be applied , treating the spacetime of the large black hole as `` background , '' and the effects of the smaller body as a perturbation to that background .    on short timescales , the smaller body moves on a trajectory that is nearly a geodesic orbit of the binary s large black hole .",
    "`` nearly '' refers to a _ self force _ arising from the small body s interaction with its perturbation to the spacetime that pushes the small body away from the geodesic worldline ; see @xcite for reviews of the self force research program and snapshots of recent progress .",
    "this self force has a dissipative component which is responsible for inspiral , and a conservative component which shifts the short - timescale motion with respect to geodesics .",
    "because the motion remains close to kerr geodesic orbits in a meaningful sense , it is useful to use geodesics as a standard against which the motion is compared .",
    "bound kerr geodesics are triperiodic @xcite .",
    "each orbit has a frequency @xmath1 that describes radial oscillations , a frequency @xmath0 that describes polar oscillations , and a frequency @xmath3 that describes rotations about the black hole s spin axis . in the weak field , these three frequencies become equal to one another , asymptoting to the frequency predicted by kepler s law .",
    "they differ significantly in the strong field , with @xmath1 generically smaller than @xmath0 and @xmath3 . as a small body spirals into the strong - field of a large black hole ,",
    "these frequencies evolve at different rates .",
    "the different rates of evolution for these frequencies have potentially important consequences for how the self interaction affects the binary . for a slowly evolving system",
    ", each component of the self force can be written as a fourier series in terms of the underlying fundamental frequencies @xcite : @xmath4 ( the @xmath5 frequency does not enter this expansion since , by axisymmetry , the self force can not depend on the axial position of the small body . ) for a slowly evolving orbit , the fourier components @xmath6 and the frequencies themselves slowly change as the orbit proceeds . for most orbits ,",
    "( [ eq : fourier_schematic ] ) indicates that the self interaction is given by a secularly evolving near - constant piece ( @xmath7 ) , plus many rapidly oscillating terms ( all terms with @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) .",
    "the rapidly oscillating terms average to zero over multiple orbits , and the bulk of the self interaction arises from @xmath7 .    the strong - field behavior of kerr black hole orbits can significantly change how the self force behaves on average .",
    "some kerr orbits are _ commensurate _ : their fundamental frequencies can be written @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are small integers . when this is the case , there will be a set of integers @xmath13 such that @xmath14 all terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourier_schematic ] ) for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : resonance ] ) holds will be non - oscillatory , and so will not average away over multiple orbits .",
    "_ resonant _ orbits , for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : resonance ] ) holds for some @xmath15 and @xmath16 , have the potential to significantly change the evolution of binary systems near commensurate orbits as compared to the `` normal '' adiabatic evolution .",
    "the importance of resonances has been the focus of several recent papers , examining their role in the astrophysics and orbital dynamics of black holes @xcite , the possibility that they may allow a significant speedup in the computation of radiation from kerr orbits @xcite , as well as their impact on the self interaction of small bodies orbiting black holes .",
    "the first analysis looking at the self interaction was by hinderer and flanagan @xcite , who developed the physical picture sketched above , and studied these systems in more detail by coupling exact kerr geodesics to a post - newtonian self - force model .",
    "they found that this resonant behavior near commensurate orbits can significantly change the evolution of a binary , `` kicking '' the evolution of the orbit s conserved integrals as compared to an analysis that does not take the resonance into effect .",
    "more quantitatively , let @xmath17 stand for one of the integrals that characterizes kerr geodesics ( the energy @xmath18 , the angular momentum @xmath19 , or the carter constant @xmath20 ) .",
    "hinderer and flanagan show that near a resonance , the rate of change @xmath21 acquires a non - trivial dependence on the relative phase @xmath22 of the binary s @xmath23 and @xmath24 motions . evolving the system through resonance",
    ", one finds that @xmath17 is kicked by an amount @xmath25 that depends on this phase , by the amount that @xmath21 differs from its average value , and by the time @xmath26 that the system is `` close to '' the resonance : @xmath27t_{\\rm res}\\;. \\label{eq : kickschematic}\\ ] ] `` close to '' a resonance is defined more precisely in sec .",
    "[ sec : dsf ] , and the phase @xmath22 is defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : gengeods ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 depends in detail on how the self interaction evolves as the system moves through the resonance .",
    "the influence of these kicks in a binary s evolution can be seen in fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( particularly the middle panel ) .",
    "we now seek to go beyond the post - newtonian approximations used in refs .",
    "@xcite , with the eventual goal of self consistently evolving a large mass ratio binary through resonances using a strong - field dissipative self force .",
    "as the tools to do this analysis are being developed @xcite , it will be useful to have some estimates of what we expect from this analysis .",
    "our goal in this paper is to study orbital resonances using approximate tools that are simpler to use than rigorously assembling the strong - field dissipative self force .",
    "previous work @xcite has given some insight into how self force components behave exactly on resonance , computing the on - resonance rates of change @xmath29 .",
    "our goal now is to begin to understand how systems behave in the vicinity of resonances .",
    "we examine a sequence of exact kerr geodesic orbits , slowly evolving through this sequence using the gair - glampedakis ( hereafter `` gg '' ) `` kludge '' approximation @xcite .",
    "combining strong - field geodesics with the gg formulas allows us to compute sequences @xmath30 which approximate those that describe a small body spiraling into a kerr black hole in general relativity .",
    "the gg formulas are designed so that a system s dissipation differs from rigorously computed strong - field formulas by no more than a few percent over the parameter range expected for astrophysical large - mass - ratio systems .",
    "they provide good estimates for the time it takes for a small body to spiral into a larger black hole , and should be good tools for surveying the `` landscape '' of orbital resonances .",
    "the particular goal of this paper is to understand some practical issues regarding the importance of resonances : how often do resonances occur in realistic inspirals ?",
    "when a resonance occurs , how long does it last ? given an ensemble of randomly selected emris , how many will encounter a resonance during their inspiral , and will those resonances last long enough that they are likely to have a strong integrated effect on the system ? answering these questions will clarify how important it is to understand resonances when modeling large mass - ratio binaries .",
    "we are particularly interested in understanding this in the context of space - based low - frequency gravitational - wave observations , like the proposed elisa mission @xcite .",
    "elisa has a nominal mission lifetime of two years .",
    "as such , resonances that occur in the final two or so years of an emri s evolution are very likely to have an impact on our ability to measure their waves with this mission .",
    "the formal answer to the question of how often resonances occur is deceptively simple : _ all _ emris encounter an _",
    "infinite _ number of resonances prior to the smaller body s plunge into the large black hole .",
    "this is because the period associated with radial motion , @xmath31 , diverges as the separatrix between stable and unstable orbits is approached ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : separatrix ] for discussion .",
    "the period @xmath32 remains finite in this limit , so @xmath33 as the separatrix is approached .",
    "though correct , this formal answer is not so interesting",
    ". the vast majority of those orbital resonances will be very short lived and occur in rapid succession .",
    "what is more interesting is to understand which resonances are long lived and likely to have a strong impact on the inspiral .",
    "that is the purpose of this paper .",
    "previous work @xcite has shown that the 3:2 , 2:1 , and 3:1 orbital resonances are especially likely to be important  the deviation of @xmath29 from @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kickschematic ] ) can be quite large , a necessary condition for the resonant parameter kick to likewise be large . in this paper ,",
    "we study how often these resonances occur and how long they last for a wide range of inspirals .",
    "we pick a set of initial conditions that cover a range similar to what is expected for astrophysical emris as observed by an instrument like elisa , and then evolve them using the gg approximation .",
    "we find that _ every _ inspiral encounters at least one of these resonance during the observationally important final two years of inspiral .",
    "many inspirals encounter two resonances , and a few encounter all three .",
    "these numbers depend strongly on binary parameters , particularly mass ratio . setting the large black hole to mass @xmath35 and the small one to @xmath36 , we find that the 3:1 resonance occurs in the last two years of inspiral for all the cases we have examined .",
    "the 2:1 resonance occurs during these two years if the binary s initial orbital inclination is not too high ( angle @xmath37 , defined precisely in sec .  [",
    "sec : gengeods ] , less than about @xmath38 ) , and the initial eccentricity is low ( @xmath39 ) . at these masses ,",
    "the 3:2 resonance does not occur during the final two years for any case we examine , although it is just slightly outside this window for very shallow ( @xmath40 ) , low eccentricity ( @xmath39 ) inspirals into rapidly spinning ( @xmath41 ) black holes .",
    "because the inspiral time scales as @xmath42 , we can find cases in which all three resonances occur in the final two years if @xmath43 is smaller than @xmath44 , or @xmath45 larger than @xmath46 .",
    "in all cases , the 3:2 resonance lasts longest , meaning that the emri spends the most time near this resonance ; the 3:1 resonance is the shortest .",
    "( `` near '' resonance is defined by examining a phase variable which is stationary exactly on resonance .",
    "we define a system to be `` near '' resonance when this variable is within 1 radian of its value exactly on the resonance . )",
    "the fact that the 3:2 resonance lasts so long is a simple consequence of the fact that it occurs in the relative weak field ( at the largest orbital radius of the resonances we survey ) .",
    "conversely , the 3:1 resonance is in the relative strong field .",
    "even the shortest resonance we survey lasts for over 50 oscillations for our @xmath47:@xmath48 binary ; most of the resonances we examine last for several hundred oscillations at these masses .",
    "the number of near - resonance oscillations scales as @xmath49 , so we generically expect many dozens of oscillations even for mass ratios close to @xmath50 or @xmath51",
    ".    taken together with the on - resonance rates of change presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , these results amplify the developing message of the importance of the resonant self interaction : resonances occur frequently enough and last long enough that they are almost certain to have an important impact on the evolution of large mass - ratio binary systems .",
    "indeed , our results imply that this behavior is generic  one should expect every observed emri to encounter a resonance",
    ". self consistent modeling of a resonance s impact on binary evolution will thus be crucial for being able to observe this systems .",

    "[ sec : scaling ] , we show how important quantities scale with the masses of the binary s members .",
    "this allows us to do our detailed numerical calculations for a single set of masses , and then to extrapolate from there .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents our results .",
    "we sample a wide range of large black hole spins , a wide range of initial eccentricity @xmath52 , and a wide range of initial orbit inclination @xmath37 .",
    "we pick the initial separation so that the binary is just beyond the 3:2 resonance , and then evolve with the gg approximation until the smaller body reaches the separatrix between stable and unstable orbits .",
    "figures [ fig : spacing ] and [ fig : duration ] show our results for representative emris ; further data are given in tables [ tab : spacinga0.1 ]  [ tab : dura0.9 ] .",

    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] .",
    "as already mentioned , our main conclusion is that resonances are ubiquitous and long lasting : we expect every astrophysical emri to encounter at least one orbital resonance en route to the binary s final plunge , and for this resonance to last long enough that it is likely to have a substantial impact on the system s evolution .",
    "this strongly motivates efforts to self consistently model how resonances impact extreme mass ratio binaries .",
    "we wrap up this paper by sketching plans for this analysis .    throughout this paper , we use `` relativist s units , '' with @xmath53 . a useful conversion in these units",
    "is @xmath54 seconds .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of the self interaction and how it drives inspiral in large mass ratio binaries .",
    "we particularly highlight how the self interaction behaves near commensurate orbits , showing how to compute the quantities which will be the focus of the remainder of this paper .",
    "consider a small body moving in the spacetime of a large black hole .",
    "the most common astrophysical motivation for this setup is the `` extreme mass ratio inspiral '' or emri , in which a compact body of mass @xmath55 is captured onto a relativistic orbit of a black hole of mass @xmath56 .",
    "we emphasize that this scenario can be taken as the large mass - ratio limit of the two - body problem in general relativity .    at zeroth order in the mass ratio ,",
    "the small body follows a geodesic of the background spacetime : @xmath57 the parameter @xmath58 is proper time along the small body s worldline , @xmath59 is its position along the worldline , and @xmath60 is the connection of the background spacetime .",
    "we will take this background to be a kerr black hole .",

    "the quantity @xmath20 is the orbit s carter constant , normalized to @xmath66 .",
    "it is related to a killing tensor admitted by the kerr spacetime : @xmath67 these three quantities are conserved on any geodesic .",

    "this expansion is very useful for describing observables such as the gravitational waves generated by a binary , since @xmath71 corresponds to time as measured on the clocks of distant observers .",

    "we will use the boyer - lindquist time expansion ( [ eq : t_expansion ] ) for this analysis .    at first order in the mass ratio ,",
    "the spacetime is deformed by the smaller body s mass .",
    "the self interaction of the small body with its own spacetime deformation can be regarded as a _ self force _ in eq .",

    ", it is enough to note that the self force can be broken into a time - symmetric conservative piece , and a time - asymmetric dissipative piece : @xmath75 on average , the dissipative self force takes energy and angular momentum from the binary , driving the small body s inspiral , and the conservative self force shifts the orbital frequencies from their background values .",
    "in this analysis , we neglect the conservative self force , focusing on the dissipative self interaction .",
    "we partially justify this by noting that the integrated conservative self interaction is smaller than the integrated effect of the dissipative piece by roughly the system s mass ratio @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that are not arguing that it is correct to neglect the conservative self force ( indeed , it is well known that the conservative self force has an important impact on the phasing of large mass ratio binaries @xcite ) , but are just suggesting that focusing on dissipation will give insight into the astrophysical relevance of resonances .",
    "we further justify neglecting the conservative self force for the pragmatic reason that the dissipative self force is presently better understood than the conservative one .",
    "mature codes exist to compute the averaged effect of dissipation @xcite , and it appears to be straightforward to generalize these codes to analyze the instantaneous dissipative self force @xcite .",
    "detailed conservative self forces have been computed for arbitrary orbits in the schwarzschild limit @xcite , and progress on the kerr case is proceding apace .",
    "it has already been noted using post - newtonian techniques that the conservative self interaction has a non - negligible impact on the analysis of resonances @xcite .",
    "flanagan and hinderer in particular find for at least one example that the conservative effect , though smaller than the leading dissipative effect by about an order of magnitude , tends to augment the dissipative effects ( see lower panel of fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "it is not clear , though , if this is a general feature of the self force .",
    "the conservative and dissipative contributions to the self force will depend on various phases in different ways , so the augmentation that they find may be an accident of the case they focus on for their analysis .",
    "it will be valuable and interesting to include strong field conservative self forces in an analysis of this sort at some point in the future .",
    "the dissipative self force has three components , which can be regarded as the instantaneous rate of change of the conserved integrals : @xmath76 these components can be written @xmath77 where @xmath17 stands for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , or @xmath20 .",
    "we separate the @xmath78 components to emphasize that these components survive any long - time averaging ; we discuss this further below .",

    "we need the derivatives @xmath148 .",
    "the derivative of any frequency @xmath149 with @xmath150 has a very simple scaling : @xmath151 the second line follows from the fact that @xmath152 has no dependence on @xmath43 or @xmath45 for @xmath153  these dependences have already been scaled out at leading order . putting factors of @xmath43 and @xmath45 back in , we see that @xmath154 by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tres ] ) , this means that @xmath155 and @xmath156 these scalings should be accurate over the extreme mass - ratio regime .",
    "we will therefore do our calculations for only a single pair of masses ( @xmath36 , @xmath35 ) , and extrapolate from that using these results .",
    "coupling the gg formulas to kerr geodesics allows us to evolve orbits under gravitational - wave emission .",
    "this evolution drives orbits deeper into the strong field until eventually they encounter a separatrix between stable and unstable .",
    "the inspiraling body then rapidly plunges into the massive black hole .",
    "perez - giz and levin @xcite provide excellent discussion of the properties of this separatrix ( noting that it can be understood by its equivalence to the family of kerr spacetime homoclinic orbits ) , including easy - to - use formulas for computing its location in the space of bound orbits ; many useful and relevant formulas can also be found in @xcite .",
    "here we briefly discuss a few critical properties of the separatrix as they pertain to our analysis .",
    "many of the properties of kerr black hole orbits are determined by the function @xmath157 defined in eq .",

    "they are determined by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath162 ; refs .",
    "@xcite provides explicit formulas for their values .",
    "bound orbits oscillate between @xmath163 ( apoapsis ) and @xmath164 ( periapsis ) , with @xmath165 in the circular limit ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "the root @xmath166 is typically inside the horizon ( @xmath167 when @xmath168 or @xmath169 ) , and is never reached by any bound orbit .",
    "orbital stability is determined by the root @xmath170 .",
    "stable bound orbits have @xmath171 ; the separatrix is defined by the condition @xmath172 .",
    "figure [ fig : stable ] shows @xmath157 for one example of a stable orbit . as orbits approach the separatrix , @xmath170 and @xmath164 move together , coinciding in the limit .",
    "along with terminating the inspiral , the separatrix has another important property for our analysis : the radial period diverges as it is approached .",
    "this is simple to understand by analyzing the radial motion using `` mino time '' @xmath173 , the time variable which separates the @xmath24 and @xmath23 motions . using @xmath173 rather than proper time @xmath58 as the independent parameter",
    ", the radial motion is governed by the equation @xmath174 the mino - time radial period is then @xmath175 the boyer - lindquist time radial period @xmath31 is easily computed from this ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the key point is that @xmath176 , and that the proportionality remains well behaved as the separatrix is approached .    at the marginally stable orbit , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda_r ] ) becomes @xmath177 this integral , and hence @xmath178 , diverges .",
    "an orbit that is precisely on the separatrix will `` whirl '' for all time on a circular trajectory at the orbit s apoapsis  the hallmark of homoclinic orbits . by their proportionality",
    ", it follows that @xmath31 also diverges as the separatrix is approached .",
    "a similar analysis shows that @xmath32 does _ not _ diverge at the separatrix , but just takes some finite value .",
    "the ratio @xmath111 therefore diverges on the separatrix , proving that ( formally , at least ) inspiraling bodies pass through an infinite number of orbital resonances en route to their final plunge into the large black hole . in practice",
    ", the small body will transition to a plunging trajectory near the separatrix .",
    "we now examine some key properties of extreme mass ratio systems as they evolve through resonances .",
    "we focus on two aspects of the system : how much inspiral remains after passing through a resonance ; and how many oscillations in @xmath23 and @xmath24 are executed near resonance .",
    "the time remaining following each resonance is an indicator of how likely the resonance is to be of observational importance .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the most observationally important emri systems are those which are a few months or years away from their final plunge",
    ". a space - based low - frequency gravitational - wave detector like elisa will be able to track the evolution of emri waves during these last few months or years .",
    "a resonance that occurs during this window is very likely to have direct observational consequences .",
    "templates describing these systems will need to account for how the resonance modifies the binary s `` normal '' adiabatic evolution in order to remain in phase with the astrophysical waveform .",
    "the number of oscillations executed at each resonance is directly related to the `` kick '' imparted to the system as it evolves through resonance .",
    "we emphasize again that to build a full picture of the resonance s impact we must self - consistently integrate the system under the influence of the dissipative self force , which we plan to do in future work @xcite .",
    "however , in the absence of this self - consistent picture , we can say with confidence that longer resonances are likely to imply greater `` kicks '' to orbital parameters , and vice versa .",
    "the duration of a resonance is thus an important indicator of its possible importance in the evolution of an emri .    before discussing our results in detail ,",
    "we first describe how we select the different inspirals that we study .",
    "our goal is to cover a range of parameters which span what is likely for astrophysical emri events that may be measured by a future low - frequency gw mission , while keeping the total number of cases we study reasonable .",
    "the algorithm we follow is as follows :    * choose the large black hole s spin from the set @xmath179 $ ] .",
    "this range nicely covers the possibilities from slow to rapid spin .",
    "* pick initial orbital eccentricity from the set @xmath180 $ ] .",
    "this set covers a large portion of the range that is likely to describe astrophysical emri events @xcite .",
    "* pick initial orbital inclination from the set @xmath181 $ ] .",
    "this set surveys a range from nearly prograde equatorial orbits to nearly retrograde equatorial orbits .",
    "we are careful not to examine orbits precisely at @xmath182 , since the gg approximation may not be reliable there . because @xmath37 evolves only slightly @xcite , its value is nearly fixed to its initial value over inspiral .",
    "* compute the value of @xmath112 so that an orbit is exactly on the 3:2 resonance .",
    "we then inflate that value by @xmath183 , and allow the binary to evolve using the gg approximation ( sec .",

    "the results are qualitatively quite similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : duration ] , though differing in quantitative detail .",
    "it s worth noting that both the duration of each resonance and the amount of inspiral left following resonance passage depend in a very simple way on a single parameter  the value of semi - latus rectum @xmath112 at the moment of resonance passage .",
    "when a resonance occurs at large @xmath112 , emri systems evolve relatively slowly , and they spend more time near resonances .",

    "a similar figure could be made to show how the time remaining in inspiral depends on @xmath193 .",
    "taken together , figs .",
    "[ fig : spacing ] and [ fig : duration ] ( and their counterparts in tables [ tab : spacinga0.1 ]  [ tab : dura0.9 ] ) present the main message of this paper : orbital resonances are ubiquitous in extreme mass ratio inspiral , and each resonance lasts for many oscillations  several dozen to many hundred , depending on the system s mass ratio .",
    "this amplifies the developing message of ongoing work on resonances : these effects are likely to have an observationally important effect on astrophysical extreme mass ratio systems .",
    "it is worth noting that , in addition to the issues we consider here and in associated analyses , many other factors have an impact on the astrophysical relevance of resonances . among them",
    "are : the lifetime of the elisa mission ( or whatever low - frequency gw mission eventually measures emri waves ) ; what portion of the emri signals overlap in time with this mission ; the strength of the waves , and hence the integrated signal - to - noise ratio ( especially the contribution to the signal - to - noise ratio from resonances ) ; and the emri event rate , both in total , and as distributed with the masses @xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "these points are , by and large , not well understood ; and they are rather coupled to one another",
    ". we will not pretend to offer any deep wisdom , but will simply note that as the community begins to think about the impact that resonances can have upon emri measurements , these points must be considered eventually as well .",
    "although we have now studied various pieces of what is needed to understand the resonant evolution of extreme mass ratio binaries , it remains necessary that they be assembled in a self - consistent manner .",

    "more precise understanding of how a system evolves through orbital resonances is almost certainly necessary to ensure that future observatories like elisa will be able to measure these waves .",
    "our plan for going beyond this analysis is to compute components of the instantaneous dissipative self force and the self consistently evolve the system as a `` forced geodesic '' @xcite .",
    "results describing the instantaneous dissipative self force for scalar fields are given in ref .",
    "@xcite ; generalizing to the gravitational interaction is straightforward provided we focus on the dissipative constribution .",
    "it turns out that all of the quantities we need can be computed with relatively minor modifications of pre - existing teukolsky - equation solvers @xcite . as an example",
    ", one component of the dissipative self force can be written as the rate of change of orbital energy per unit mino time @xmath173 @xcite : @xmath194 where @xmath195 are orbital frequencies conjugate to mino - time @xmath173 , and where @xmath196 the amplitudes @xmath197 describe the amplitude of the curvature scalar @xmath198 in a harmonic and fourier decomposition ; superscript @xmath199 denotes complex conjugation , @xmath200 relates mino - time @xmath173 to boyer - lindquist time @xmath71 , and @xmath201 is a mode frequency conjugate to @xmath71 .",
    "the self force is of course gauge dependent ; however , a two - timescale analysis @xcite shows that its impact over a long timescale @xmath202 is dominated by a gauge - independent result ( with subleading gauge - dependent contributions that scale as @xmath203 ) .",
    "hence the results computed in this way are not gauge ambiguous provided we integrate the system over a long time compared to a typical orbital period .",
