    "collective low lying levels of the nucleus are often deduced numerically from the interacting bosons model ( ibm ) @xcite or the generalized bohr hamiltonian ( gbh ) @xcite-@xcite . restricting ourselves to the latter we can say that it is built on the basis of seven functions : the collective potential energy of deformation of the nucleus , and for its kinetic - energy part , three mass parameters ( also called vibrational parameters ) and three moments of inertia .",
    "all these functions depend on the deformation of the nuclear surface .",
    "usually , the deformation energy can be evaluated in the framework of the constrained hartree - fock theory ( chf ) or by the phenomenological shell correction method .",
    "the mass parameters and the moments of inertia are often approximated by the cranking formula @xcite-@xcite or in the self consistent approaches by other models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "most of the self - consistent formulations are based on the adiabatic time dependent hartree - fock - bogolyoubov approximation ( atdhfb ) which leads to constrained hartree - fock - bogolioubov ( chfb ) calculations @xcite-@xcite in which the so - called thouless - valatin corrections are neglected .",
    "it is to be noted that there are several self - consistent formulations for the mass parameters in which always some approximations are made ( not always the same ) .",
    "other types of approaches of the mass parameters use the so - called generator coordinate method combined with the gaussian - overlap - approximation ( gcm+goa ) @xcite .",
    "recently new methods have again been developped @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this leads to a certain confusion and the problem of the evaluation of the mass parameters remains ( up to now ) a controversial question as already noticed in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this paper we will focus exclusively on the mass parameters , especially on the problems induced by the cranking formula , i.e. the `` classical '' inglis - belyaev formula of the vibrational parameters .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that this formula leads sometimes to inextricable problems when the pairing correlations are taken into account ( by means of the bcs model ) .",
    "the transition between normal @xmath0 and superfluid phase @xmath1 affects generally the magic nuclei near the spherical shape under the changing of the deformation @xcite .",
    "the problem occurs sometimes ( not always ) exactly in these cases for an unpaired system @xmath2 in that cases the mass parameters take anomalous very large values near a `` critical '' deformation close to the spherical shape .",
    "this singular behaviour is well - known and constitutes undoubtedly unphysical effect .",
    "it has been early found that these problems are due simply to the presence of the derivatives of @xmath3 ( pairing gap ) and @xmath4 ( fermi level ) in the formula .",
    "they have been reported many times @xcite , @xcite-@xcite in the litterature , but no solution has been proposed .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite claim that for sufficiently large pairing gaps @xmath3 the total mass parameter is essentially given by the diagonal part without the derivatives , whereas those of ref .",
    "@xcite affirm that the role of the derivatives is by no mean small in the fission process and this leads to contradictory conclusions .",
    "other studies @xcite neglect the derivatives without any justification .",
    "some self - consistent calculations met also the same difficulties .",
    "for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , resonances in mass parameters have also already been noticed . as in the present work they were attributed to the derivative of the gap parameter @xmath3 near the pairing phase transition . in short , up to now",
    "the problem remains unclear .",
    "curiously , one must point out that contrary to the vibrational parameters , the same formulation ( inglis - belyaev ) for the moments of inertia does not exhibit any explicit dependence on @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( as the i - b formula does for the mass parameters ) and this explains why the i - b formula for the moments of inertia does not meet such problems .",
    "this difference appears not so natural and is a part of the motivation of this work .",
    "all these problems as well as intensive numerical calculations led us to ask ourselves if the presence of these derivatives is well founded .",
    "if this is not the case , their removal should be justified .",
    "in fact , the inglis - belyaev formula is based on the fundamental hypothesis on contributions of two - quasiparticle states excitations .",
    "rigorously it turns out that the derivatives of @xmath3 and @xmath4 do not belong to this type of excitations and this must explain their reject from the formula.the object of this paper is not so much to tell if this model is good or not or to specify the field of the validity this model , etc ... this study is simply and wholly devoted to a correction of the inglis - belyaev formula in the light of its fundamental hypothesis .",
    "the mass ( or vibrational ) parameters are given by the inglis formula @xcite , @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are respectively the ground state and the excited states of the nucleus .",
    "the quantities @xmath7 are the associated eigenenergies . in the independent - particle model , whenever the state of the nucleus is assumed to be a slater determinant ( built on single - particle states of the nucleons ) , the ground state@xmath8 will be of course the one where all the particles occupy the lowest states . the excited states @xmath9 will be approached by the one particle - one hole configurations . in that case ,",
    "( [ massparameters ] ) becomes:@xmath10 where @xmath11 or in short @xmath12 is a set of deformation parameters .",

    "it must be noted that in eq .",
    "( [ massparameterssingle2 ] ) the denominator @xmath21 vanishes in the case where the fermi level coincides with two or more degenerate levels .",
    "this is the major drawback of the formula .",

    "of course , from equations ( [ bcs1 ] ) and ( [ bcs2 ] ) the deformation dependence of the eigenenergies @xmath46 involves the ones of @xmath3 and @xmath4.formally , the solution of eq.([bcs1 ] ) and ( [ bcs2 ] ) amounts to express @xmath3 and @xmath4 as functions of the set of the energy levels @xmath47 .",
    "it is well known that the bcs equations have non - trivial solutions only above a critical value of the strength @xmath48 of the pairing interaction .",

    "this constitutes really a contradiction and a paradox in this formula.in the quantity @xmath38 of eq ( [ mumu ] ) the diagonal matrix elements @xmath68 are finite and relatively small , it is then clear that it is the derivatives @xmath69 and @xmath70 which cause the problem .",
    "these features have been checked in numerical calculations . in this respect ,",
    "the formulae ( [ difflamda ] ) and ( [ diffdelta ] ) which give these derivatives are subject to a major drawback because their common denominator , i.e. @xmath71 can accidentally cancel .",
    "let us study briefly this situation . in effect",
    ", this can be easily explained because in unpaired situation we must have @xmath72 involving @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ ab ] ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath74 is defined as a sum of postive and negative values depending on whether the terms are below or above the fermi level .",
    "therefore ,  it could happen accidentally that @xmath75 in eq ( [ ab ] ) involving serious drawbacks or at least numerical instabilities .",
    "in the independent - particle approximation the contributions to the mass parameters are simply due to one particle - one hole excitations .",
    "thus in the formulae ( [ unoe ] ) or ( [ massparameterssingle2 ] ) the particle - hole excitations are denoted by the single - particle states @xmath76 and @xmath77 . when the pairing correlations are taken into account ,",
    "the contributions are supposed due only to two - quasiparticle excitations states @xmath78 @xmath79 in eq . which gives rise to the first term of eq.([with ] ) .",
    "the second term of this formula is due to the derivatives of the probability amplitudes and has to be interpreted as two quasiparticle excitations of the type @xmath80 .",
    "however this is not true for all the terms entering into the product of the quantities @xmath81 .",
    "let us re - focus onto the formula ( [ with ] ) in which we will replace in the second sum the quantity @xmath3 by its equivalent from the identity @xmath82 .",
    "after simplification of the coefficient of @xmath83 we obtain : @xmath84 the fundamental point is in this way it is clear that all the quantities in eq .",

    "( [ bcs1])-([bcs2 ] ) are due to all the spectrum , they are clearly not specifically linked to these two particular states ( otherwise indices @xmath57 and @xmath58 should appear with these quantities )",
    ". therefore they can not be really considered as contributions due to two quasiparticle excitation states which is the basic hypothesis of the inglis - belyaev formula .",
    "therefore they can not be taken into account.with this additional assumption , the element @xmath38 must reduce to nothing but a simple matrix element : @xmath87 consequently this contributes to simplify greatly the formula ( [ mp ] ) which becomes:@xmath88 it is to be noted that the missing term @xmath89 in the double sum is precisely the contribution of the simple sum of the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ mpp ] ) .",
    "therefore , the formula ( [ mpp ] ) can be reformulated in a compact form : @xmath90 in this more `` symmetric '' form , this formula looks like more naturally to the inglis - belyaev formula of the moments of inertia which does not contain dependence on the derivatives of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the `` new '' formula corrects the previous paradox because in the case of the phase transition @xmath64 , we will have in this limit for the diagonal terms @xmath91 @xmath92 for any @xmath57 and due to the fact that the corresponding matrix element @xmath93 is finite the second term of eq .",

    "in some rare but important illustrative cases the application of the inglis - belyaev formula to the mass parameters reveals incontestable weaknesses in the limit of unpaired systems @xmath64 . in effect",

    "it has been reported in the litterature that self - consistent calculations meet also the same kind of problems ( see text ) .",
    "after extensive calculations within the inglis - belyaev formula , we realized that these problems are inherent to a spurious presence of the derivatives of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the formula .",
