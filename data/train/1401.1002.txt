    "the dimension theory of dynamical systems studies the dimensional characteristics ( such as hausdorff dimension ) of the invariant sets of dynamical systems .",
    "see @xcite for an introduction to the theory , or @xcite for a recent review of this field .",
    "past work has examined how dimensional characteristics of various dynamical systems can change with respect to perturbations of the system ; for example the differentiability of entropy of anosov flows @xcite , srb measures in hyperbolic flows @xcite , and hausdorff dimension of horseshoes @xcite .",
    "however this kind of problem has not been considered in the context of open billiard systems .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of the non - wandering set has been estimated for open billiards in the plane @xcite and in higher dimensions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that the hausdorff dimension of the non - wandering set for an open billiard in the plane depends smoothly on perturbations to the boundary of the billiard .",
    "specifically , if the boundary of the billiard is @xmath0-smooth and depends @xmath1-smoothly on a perturbation parameter @xmath2 , then the hausdorff dimension is @xmath3-smooth with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "further , we find bounds for the derivative of the hausdorff dimension with respect to @xmath2 , and we show that if the boundary is real analytic then the dimension is real analytic .    a billiard is a dynamical system in which a single pointlike particle moves at constant speed in some domain @xmath4 and reflects off the boundary @xmath5 according to the classical laws of optics @xcite .",
    "open billiards are a class of billiard in which the domain @xmath6 is unbounded .",

    "we assume that @xmath13 satisfies the _ no - eclipse condition _",
    "@xmath14 introduced by ikawa in @xcite :    @xmath14 : :    for distinct @xmath15 , the convex hull of    @xmath16 is disjoint from @xmath17 .",
    "this condition ensures that the collision angle @xmath18 is bounded above by a constant @xmath19 , and prevents discontinuities in the non - wandering set @xmath20 which consists of all bounded billiard trajectories in @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider smooth homotopies ( with a parameter @xmath2 ) between different billiards , which we call billiard deformations . section [ billiards ] contains some preliminaries on open billiards and a precise definition of the deformations .",
    "we show that the periodic trajectories in the non - wandering set are differentiable and lipschitz with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "we extend this to the whole non - wandering set , and show that the curvature of the stable and unstable manifolds are also differentiable and lipschitz .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of the non - wandering set was estimated in @xcite by investigating convex fronts .",
    "this was later improved and extended to higher dimensional billiards in @xcite . in this paper , using techniques from pesin s book on dimension theory in dynamical systems @xcite , we recover the estimates in @xcite and show that they also apply to the lower and upper box dimensions . that is , @xmath21 where @xmath22 are constants that depend on simple geometric characteristics of the obstacles .",
    "furthermore we show that these dimensions depend differentiably on the boundary of the billiard obstacles .",
    "that is , if the billiard is shifted or deformed smoothly with some parameter @xmath2 , then the function @xmath23 is differentiable with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , it is almost as smooth as the deformation , and for the first derivative we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a constant depending only on simple geometrical characteristics of the obstacles .",
    "consider the set @xmath6 described in the introduction .",

    "the set @xmath67 together with an inner product inducing this norm is a riemannian manifold .",
    "the _ non - wandering set _ of a billiard is the set of points whose trajectories are bounded .",
    "the non - wandering set of the billiard flow is denoted @xmath68 or @xmath69 , and its restriction to the boundary of @xmath13 is @xmath70 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath71 is the non - wandering set of the billiard map @xmath62 .",

    "frequently we will have some quantity that depends on a scalar @xmath2 and a vector ( or sometimes a scalar ) @xmath76 , and we will show that its derivatives are bounded by some constants . rather than numbering these constants , we will label them with the quantity being differentiated in the subscript and the number of differentiations in the superscript .",
