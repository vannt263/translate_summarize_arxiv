    "the phase transition from a low temperature phase , where quarks and gluons are confined into hadrons , to a high temperature phase , where a quark - gluon plasma of interacting quasi - particles can appear , is one of the most important features of su(n ) gauge theories at finite temperature .",
    "many present investigations ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) are devoted to clarify the kind of phase transition as a function of the number of light quarks and of their masses and to determine the critical temperature . when the phase transition is _ second order _",
    ", it becomes essential to determine its critical indices , since they rule the dependence of macroscopic observables on the temperature in the critical region .",
    "moreover , they allow to identify the universality class of the transition and , consequently , the relevant degrees of freedom near criticality .",
    "pure su(n ) gauge theories at finite temperature possess all essential features of the deconfinement transition and represent an ideal laboratory to understand mechanisms and to set up methods of investigation , since they can be simulated on a space - time lattice with relatively small effort .",
    "the order parameter of the deconfinement transition in a su(n ) pure gauge theory is the polyakov loop  @xcite , defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the link variable at the site @xmath3 in the @xmath4 direction and @xmath5 is the lattice spacing .",
    "let us consider the transformation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 belongs to the _ center _ of the gauge group , z(n ) , and @xmath8 is any fixed ( lattice ) time coordinate . under this transformation",
    "the lattice action is left invariant , the polyakov loop @xmath9 transforms instead in @xmath10 .",
    "if the z(n ) symmetry were unbroken , @xmath11 should always vanish ; instead , owing to spontaneous symmetry breaking , @xmath12 above a critical temperature @xmath13 .",
    "the deconfinement transition coincides with the spontaneous breaking of the z(n ) global symmetry .    by integrating out all degrees of freedom of the @xmath14-dimensional su(n )",
    "gauge theory except the order parameter , it is possible to generate an effective @xmath15-dimensional statistical model for the polyakov loop , having z(n ) as global symmetry group . according to the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture  @xcite , if the @xmath14-dimensional gauge theory undergoes a second order phase transition , its critical indices coincide with those of the effective @xmath15-dimensional model , if the latter has also a second order phase transition .",
    "moreover their critical behavior , including finite size scaling , is predicted to coincide and is determined essentially by the z(n ) global symmetry .",
    "so , in particular , 3d su(3 ) pure gauge theory belongs to the universality class of 2d z(3 ) ( 3-state potts ) model and 4d su(2 ) pure gauge theory to that of 3d z(2 ) ( ising ) model .",
    "a new method has recently been proposed  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) for the computation of the critical indices of a pure gauge theory with second order deconfinement transition .",
    "the method , described in detail in the next section , is based on the finite size behavior of `` simple '' lattice operators , such as the plaquette , and allows very accurate determinations with small computational effort .",
    "it has been already successfully tested for the computation of the critical index @xmath0 of the correlation length for the case of 3d su(3 ) pure gauge theory  @xcite . in that case a precise determination of @xmath0 was obtained , in perfect agreement with the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture and with remarkably improved accuracy with respect to an earlier determination based on the monte carlo method  @xcite . here",
    ", we apply the same method to determine @xmath0 for the case of 4d su(2 ) pure gauge theory . on the basis of the previous experience  @xcite",
    ", we expect to improve the accuracy with respect to the existing determination  @xcite , based on monte carlo methods , which gave @xmath16=0.630(9 ) .",
    "[ sec : nu ] to illustrate the method , let us consider the determination of the critical index @xmath0 of the correlation length @xmath17 , defined as @xmath18 for a general @xmath15-dimensional statistical model a possible way of extracting the value of @xmath0 from lattice monte carlo simulations is to study the finite size scaling ( fss ) behavior of the energy operator : fss theory predicts that , if @xmath19 is the lattice size , the expectation value of the ( lattice ) energy operator behaves for large @xmath19 as  @xcite e_l~e_+k l^-d , [ efss ] where @xmath20 is the expectation value of the energy operator in the thermodynamic limit and @xmath21 is a non - universal constant .    compared to other methods based on the fss of fluctuation operators such as susceptibilities or binder cumulants , the advantage lies in the fact that @xmath22 can be computed to high accuracy .",
    "the main drawback is that the term containing @xmath0 in eq.([efss ] ) is subdominant for @xmath23 with respect to the bulk contribution @xmath20 .",
    "the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite have clearly shown that , in the case of gauge theories , the advantages outweigh the drawbacks and the method can give very accurate results .    in order to apply the same method to the @xmath14-dimensional gauge theory , it is necessary to compute expectation values of operators having the same finite size behavior of the energy in the @xmath15-dimensional statistical model .",
    "let us consider a gauge invariant operator @xmath24 that is invariant also under the global symmetry given by the center of the gauge group , such as any wilson loop or any correlator of the form p(x ) p^(y ) , [ pp ] where @xmath9 and @xmath25 are polyakov loops at two different sites @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the @xmath15-dimensional space .",
    "it is natural to expect that the operator product expansion ( ope ) of any such operator at criticality has the same form as the one of @xmath28 : = c_i  i + c _   + .",
    "[ ope ] here @xmath29 and @xmath30 are , respectively , the identity and the _ scaling _ energy operator in the statistical model , and the dots represent contributions of operators with higher dimension .",
    "two remarks are in order here .",
    "first , the scaling energy operator @xmath28 is not to be confused with the _ lattice _",
    "energy operator @xmath28 , which is just an example of an operator in the statistical model with ope given by eq .",
    "( [ ope ] ) .",
    "second , the operators appearing in eq .",
    "( [ ope ] ) are , formally , functionals of the order parameter of the @xmath14-dimensional gauge theory , i.e. of the polyakov loop .",
    "the dynamics of the order parameters at criticality is , however , the same in the @xmath14-dimensional gauge theory and in the @xmath15-dimensional statistical model , so that such a distinction is practically unessential .",
    "the ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ ope ] ) was introduced and tested in ref .",
    "@xcite , and used in ref .",
    "@xcite , to obtain some exact results on correlation functions of 3d gauge theories at the deconfinement transition .    in particular , eq .",
    "( [ ope ] ) implies that the fss behavior of the expectation value @xmath31 will have the form of eq .",
    "( [ efss ] ) : _",
    "l~_+c l^-d .",
    "[ ofss ] the contributions of the irrelevant operators will be subleading for @xmath32 .",
    "we conclude that the fss behavior of any such operator can be used to determine the value of @xmath0 through eq .",
    "( [ ofss ] ) .",
    "the obvious advantage is that one can use operators , such as the plaquette , whose expectation value can be computed to high accuracy with relatively modest computational effort .    in the next section",
    ", we use the described method in practice , to determine the critical index @xmath0 for the 4d su(2 ) pure gauge theory .",
    "the lattice operators we considered are ( i ) time - like ( `` electric '' ) plaquette , ( ii ) space - like ( `` magnetic '' ) plaquette , ( iii ) the correlator @xmath33 , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 taken to be nearest neighbors sites in the 3d ( spatial ) lattice .",
    "all these observables possess the required symmetry properties to have an ope given by eq .",
    "( [ ope ] ) , and hence a fss behavior as in eq .",
    "( [ ofss ] ) .",
    "moreover they can be computed to high accuracy in monte carlo simulations .",
    "expectation values were computed on lattices with temporal extension @xmath34 and spatial sizes @xmath35 ranging from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "simulations must be performed at criticality , i.e. at the critical value of the lattice ( inverse ) coupling constant @xmath38 for the given @xmath39 .",
    "we fixed @xmath38 at the central value of the determination of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath40=1.8735 .",
    "the simulation algorithm we adopted was the over - relaxed heat - bath  @xcite . for each simulation",
    "we collected a number of equilibrium configurations ranging from 50k to 4.8 m , according to the lattice size , separated each other by a number of iterations of the order of the autocorrelation time .",
    "the error analysis was performed by the jackknife method applied to data bins at different levels of blocking .",
    "we report in table  1 the expectation values we obtained . because of the asymmetry of the lattice , space - like and time - like plaquettes have obviously different expectation values and must be considered as two different operators .",
    "to evaluate @xmath0 , we performed a single multibranched fit of the three data sets . to avoid cross - correlations we included in the fit only magnetic plaquettes from lattices with odd @xmath19 and electric plaquettes from lattices with even @xmath19 .",
    "polyakov loop correlations were measured in separate runs and therefore are not correlated with the plaquette measurements .",
    "the result of the fit is = 0.6298(28 ) , ^2/d.o.f.=0.96 , in excellent agreement , as predicted by the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture , with the most accurate determination for the 3d ising model , @xmath41 , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by the high - temperature expansion method .",
    "according to expectations , the accuracy of our result is improved in comparison to the existing monte carlo evaluation , based on the @xmath42 analysis of the topological loop susceptibility , which gives @xmath43  @xcite .    in figs .  1 - 3",
    ", we plot the expectation values of electric plaquette , magnetic plaquette and polyakov loop correlator for different values of @xmath19 versus @xmath44 , where @xmath0 is ( the central value of ) our determination .",
    "in this paper , we have applied a recently proposed method for the evaluation of critical indices of the deconfinement transition in pure gauge theories to the case of 4d su(2 ) .",
    "our result for the critical index @xmath0 of the correlation length confirms the conclusion of the analogous determination for the case of 3d su(3 ) by the same method .",
    "namely , the proposed method allows very precise results for critical indices , since it is based on the evaluation of `` simple '' expectation values , such as that of the plaquette .",
    "the same method can be used to evaluate the critical coupling , which here was taken from the literature : one should perform simulations at different values of @xmath38 in the critical region and , for each of them , determine @xmath0 by the fit with the finite size scaling law ; the critical value of @xmath38 can be obtained by comparing the @xmath42 s of the different fits .",
