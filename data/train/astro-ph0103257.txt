    "the atmospheric chemical composition of post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) stars and circumstellar environments is determined by nucleosynthesis and dredge - up events at the late agb phases . at agb",
    ", the star has a c@xmath1o core surrounded by helium and hydrogen burning shells above which lies a deep convective envelope . the thermally pulsating phase ( tp - agb ) ,",
    "though much shorter than early agb phase ( e - agb ) , is responsible , through considerable mass - loss , for the ejection of large fraction of carbon and @xmath2-process elements into the ism . at this phase ,",
    "thermal pulses are caused by instabilities in the he - burning shell first discovered by schwarzschild & hrm ( 1965 ) and weigert ( 1966 ) .",
    "the excess energy generated by he shell flashes is transported by convection over the region that extends from the base of he - burning shell and the hydrogen - helium discontinuity .",
    "the he shell instabilities strongly influence the chemical composition of the convective envelope .",
    "the expansion and cooling of the intershell layers during a powerdown phase of the he shell flash causes the deepening of the convective envelope into regions containing the products of partial he - burning .",
    "the @xmath3c , @xmath4f and the @xmath2-process elements are mixed into the outer envelope causing abundance variations at the surface of these stars .",
    "this process , known as the third dredge - up ( tdu ) , is able to explain the formation of carbon stars ( busso , gallino & wasserburg 1999 ) , wallerstein et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , mowlavi ( 1999 ) . at agb",
    "the star is constantly losing mass , but a final phase of enhanced mass - loss by the superwind is believed to terminate the agb phase producing a planetary nebula .",
    "therefore , studying the chemical composition of the atmospheres and envelopes of evolved stars with ir fluxes , one expects to identify post - agb stars and to provide important observational constraints for the theoretical work on nucleosynthesis , internal structure and mass - loss in evolved intermediate and low - mass stars .",
    "post - agb stars , as they evolve across the h - r diagram towards the white dwarf stage , form families of rather exotic objects like the r crb stars , other subgroups of h - deficient and he - rich stars , planetary nebulae etc . in the h - r diagram",
    ", they populate the region generally occupied by massive young supergiants evolving redwards from the main sequence , and having similar temperatures and luminosities . to differentiate the massive and young stars from the highly evolved low - mass post - agb stars ,",
    "detailed atmospheric abundance analysis is crucial .",
    "chemical analysis of high galactic latitude a - f supergiants have led to the discovery of many interesting post - agb stars such as hr 7671 ( luck et al .",
    "1990 ) , hr 4912 ( lambert et al .",
    "1983 ) , hr 4114 ( giridhar et al . 1997 ) or of selected iras sources such as iras 22223 + 4327 and iras",
    "04296 + 3429 ( decin et al .",
    "1998 ) . however , most of these high galactic latitude stars are field stars of unknown distances .",
    "it is therefore likely that a significant fraction of them could possibly turn out to be disk objects of nearly solar compositions .",
    "a search of post - agb stars among high galactic latitude stars could be more rewarding if we put the additional constraint of ir detection .",
    "the wavelength dependence of ir fluxes and also the detection of submillimeter fluxes could give valuable information on the circumstellar matter surrounding the evolved star .",
    "the iras two colour diagrams such as those published by olnon et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , van der veen and habing ( 1988 ) etc .",
    ", are extremely useful in separating stars with different kinds of envelopes .    in this study",
    ", we have undertaken the abundance analysis of a selected sample of stars likely to be post - agb stars . from the published lists of high galactic latitude stars ( @xmath5 ) ( e.g. bidelman 1990 and others ) we chose the ones with known infrared fluxes . among them",
    ", the ones falling into the regions via and vib of figure 5b of van der veen & habing ( 1988 ) were preferred as they were more likely to be post - agb stars .",
    "we have also included a few objects belonging to the regions iiia and iiib that are likely to be evolved stars with oxygen - rich envelopes .    the hot star hd 172324 was also included in spite of not being an iras source since it has high radial velocity ( @xmath1110 km  s@xmath0 ) and very complex structures in hydrogen line profiles .",
    "it appeared to be a possible hot post - agb star similar to those investigated by conlon et al .",
    "( 1993a;b ) .    a search for post - agb stars among supergiant - like stars of high galactic latitude is expected to be more efficient since the possibility of forming stars at truly large distances from the galactic plane is low .",
    "this program is also aimed at providing calibrators for photometric empirical calibrations of atmospheric abundances ( arellano ferro & mantegazza 1996 ) , temperatures , and gravities in particular , since gravities are better determined from the ionization equilibrium .",

    "the observational material for this work was obtained during july 6 - july 12 , 1999 with the 1.93 m telescope of the haute - provence observatory ( ohp ) , which is equipped with the high resolution ( 42,000 ) echelle spectrograph elodie .",

    "the equivalent widths were measured using the _ splot _ task of the iraf package and their accuracy is generally better than 10% for spectra with @xmath15 ratio larger than 50 .",
    "we generally restricted ourselves to unblended weak features and avoided using lines stronger than 200  m .",

    "the procedure assumes plane - parallel atmospheres , hydrostatic equilibrium and lte .",
    "the oscillator strength or @xmath16 value is an important atomic datum that affects the abundance calculations . for elements",

    "in addition to abundances , the line strengths are strongly affected by atmospheric parameters like the effective temperature ( @xmath17 ) , gravity ( log @xmath18 ) and turbulent velocity ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "it is therefore necessary to determine these parameters before using line strengths for abundance determinations .",
    "temperature calibrations exist that are valid for specific spectral type ranges .",
    "these methods are not only useful but also complement the spectroscopic efforts by providing initial values for the atmospheric parameters for calculating the atmospheric abundances . here",
    "we briefly describe some of those calibrations that have been used for the stars of our sample . later in sect .",
    "5 , comparison with the finally adopted spectroscopic results is made in the discussion of each individual star .",
    "firstly , a rough estimate of @xmath17 can be made from the given spectral type and the calibration of schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) .",
    "however , more accurate values can be obtained from precise photometric colours . for our sample ,",
    "we have used @xmath20 photometric data and our own unpublished calibrations for f - g stars ( hd 725 , hd 9167 , hd 172481 ) .",
    "in addition , the calibration of napiwotzki , shnberner & wenske ( 1993 ) for hotter stars like hd 172324 , the 13-colour photometric system and the calibration of bravo alfaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and the geneva colour indices and the calibration of cramer & maeder ( 1979 ) were used as appropriate .",
    "these empirical calibrations provide @xmath17 with accuracies of @xmath21 k or better and serve as excellent starting values that are further refined by spectroscopic approaches .",
    "any drastic difference between the two approaches deserves attention .",
    "yet another independent approach to estimate @xmath17 is from the balmer lines profiles fitting ( e.g. arellano ferro 1985 ; venn 1995a ) .",
    "theoretical balmer profiles for grids of model atmospheres have been calculated by kurucz ( 1993 ) . for stars of intermediate temperature ,",
    "this method does not lead to unique @xmath17 , but rather it defines loci of possible temperatures and gravities . on the other hand , similar loci can be found from species where two states of ionization are well represented .",
    "again , the solution is not unique but rather a locus on the @xmath17 - @xmath22 plane is defined for each element .",
    "this approach will be illustrated in fig .",
    "3 for h@xmath23 , h@xmath24 , mg and si for the star hd 218753 .",
    "the above solution is of special importance for hot stars where no fe i lines are present . for hotter stars , lines of fe",
    "i are not only very weak but are also influenced by non - lte effects . for a - f",
    "supergiants non - lte effects could cause errors in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 dex in the iron abundance derived using fe i lines ( boyarchuck et al .",
    "for example , in the well - known star vega ( a0v ) , the neglect of departure from lte for fe i lines leads to the underestimation of fe abundance by 0.3 dex ( gigas 1986 ) .    for stars cooler than 7500 k the lines of fe i and fe ii with wide range in line strengths and lower excitation potential are adequate for estimating the effective temperature , microturbulence and gravity for any given star .",

    "the primordial abundance of li ( based on population ii objects ) is considered near log  @xmath89(li ) = 2.2 . the excess abundance must therefore be caused by agb evolution of hd 172481 or might owe its origin to binarity .",

    "the effect is very prominent at temperature range 5500 to 6000 k and declines for lower temperatures . for stars cooler than 5000",
    "k the effect was barely perceptible . at temperatures",
    "higher than 7000 k , we expect the effect to be larger .",
    "it is indeed true for hr 4049 ( lambert et al .",
    "1988 ) which has @xmath17 = 7500 k , i.e. similar to hd 158616 and hd 172481 .",
    "however , for these two stars we did not see any indication of dust condensation and subsequent removal of grain - forming elements .",
    "hd 158616 is a carbon - rich post - agb star similar to hd 56126 ( klochkova 1995 ) and hd 187785 ( van winckel et al .",
    "1996 ) also showing significant enhancement of @xmath2-process elements .",
    "stars like hr 4049 , hd 52961 and rv tau stars of subclass b show c / o @xmath204 1 and mild @xmath2-process enhancement . as a matter of fact",
    ", most stars showing abundance peculiarities caused by dust condensation have c / o @xmath204 1 .",
    "stars hr 4049 , hd 44179 , hd 46703 , hd 52961 and bd + 39@xmath105 4926 possibly belong to this subgroup .",
    "for these objects , since fe gets locked in grains , [ s / h ] is considered a better indicator of metallicity . for these stars [ s / h ] ranges between + 0.1 to @xmath11.0 dex with a mean around @xmath10.4 dex .",
    "in other words , they are mildly metal - deficient .",
    "carbon - rich post - agb stars with enhanced @xmath2-process elements , like hd 158616 , hd 56126 and hd 187785 have [ fe / h ] ( which would be a true reflection of their metallicity since these stars are not affected by dust condensation ) in the range @xmath10.4 to @xmath11.0 dex .",
    "these values are not radically different from those found for the subgroup having dust - grain condensation and c / o @xmath204 1 .",
    "we , therefore , do not visualize large differences in their ages though the o - rich phase in the agb is expected to precede the c - rich phase .",
    "the abundances of hot post - agb stars studied by conlon et al .",
    "( 1993a ) and mccausland et al .",
    "( 1992 ) bear close resemblance to hd 172324 .",
    "the hot post - agb stars show strong deficiency of carbon and significant oxygen enrichment .",
    "these stars probably belong to a subgroup of post - agb star that have evolved without experiencing third dredge - up .",
    "this carbon deficiency is also found in the proto - planetary nebula hde 341617 ( see table 13 ) .",
    "caution is however needed with c ii spectra since they are known to show large non - lte effects ( eber & butler 1988 ; takeda & takada - hidai 1994 ) .",
    "mccausland et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have discussed at length two scenarios to explain the carbon deficiency .",
    "hbb occuring during interpulse phase could cause the production of @xmath93n at the expense of @xmath3c .",
    "however , overabundance of he like the one found in the smc planetary nebula smp 28 is not evident for hd 172324 and hd 341617 to make hbb the sole mechanism responsible for carbon deficiency .",
    "another possibility suggested by mccausland et al .",
    "( 1992 ) that the carbon deficiency might be inherent to the precursor itself is quite attractive .",
    "to substantiate their argument they pointed out the carbon - poor stars hr 4912 and hr 7671 as possible precursors to more evolved carbon - poor hot post - agb stars .",
    "hr 4912 was included in our recent work and we found [ c / h ] = @xmath11.27 ( giridhar et al .",
    "1997 ) in good agreement with [ c / h ] of @xmath11.15 found by lambert , luck & bond ( 1983 ) .",
    "hr 7671 has [ c / h ] of @xmath11.53 ( luck et al .",
    "it seems therefore that hd 172324 and hde 341617 might form a special carbon - poor post - agb stars evolutionary sequence .",
    "search for carbon - poor objects in all temperature ranges may help in finding the precursors or successors of these objects .",
    "we have found a new post - agb star hd 172481 for which abundance analysis had not been carried out before , however the referee pointed out in a rather late stage of revision , the then unpublished work by reyniers & van winckel ( 2001 ) where an independent abundance analysis has been carried out .",
    "we have highlighted a comparison of results in section 5.5 and found both analyses to be in fairly good agreement .",
    "we have done a more complete analysis of hd 158616 .",
    "this star can be now considered a post - agb star beyond any doubt . among the post - agb stars ,",
    "the number of stars showing c / o @xmath308 or greater and also enhancement of @xmath2-process elements are very few .",
    "there are clear indications of stars having experienced the third dredge - up .",
    "the stars hd 158616 and hd 172481 belong to this important class .",
    "c / o of hd 172481 might have been prevented from exceeding one by hbb .",
    "the same may be responsible for large li abundance but other possibilities like binarity can not be ruled out .",
    "a long - term light and radial velocity monitoring of this object is planned for the future .",
    "we found a very likely hot post - agb candidate in hd 172324 but will feel more confident of its status after important elements like n are included and a more comprehensive study is made .",
    "continuous monitoring of its spectrum in the h@xmath228 region is required to detect activity possibly related to stellar pulsations .",
    "hd 218753 and hd 331319 have passed the giant branch and are in the he - core and h - shell burning stages .",
    "hd 9167 and hd 173638 essentially show solar abundance .",
    "hd 725 and hd 9167 show large radial velocities , however their galactocentric orbits are on the galactic plane and mildly eccentric , thus they are most likely massive and young disk stars",
    ". however , their large radial velocity could also be due to pulsations and/or orbital motions .",
