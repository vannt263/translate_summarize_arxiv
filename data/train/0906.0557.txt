    "given a vector @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the resource allocated to user @xmath3 , _ how fair _ is it ?",
    "one approach to quantify the degree of fairness associated with @xmath4 is through a fairness measure , which is a function @xmath5 that maps @xmath4 into a real number .",
    "various fairness measures have been proposed throughout the years , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "these range from simple ones , e.g. , the ratio between the smallest and the largest entries of @xmath4 , to more sophisticated functions , e.g. , jain s index and the entropy function .",
    "some of these fairness measures map @xmath4 to normalized ranges between 0 and 1 , where 0 denotes the minimum fairness , 1 denotes the maximum fairness , often corresponding to an @xmath4 where all @xmath2 are the same , and a larger value indicate more fairness . for example , min - max ratio  @xcite is given by the maximum ratio of any two user s resource allocation , while jain s index  @xcite computes a normalized square mean .",
    "how are these fairness measure are related ?",
    "is one measures `` better '' than any other ?",
    "what other measures of fairness may be useful ?",
    "an alternative approach that has gained attention in the networking research community since  @xcite is the approach of @xmath0-fairness and the associated utility maximization . given a set of feasible allocations ,",
    "a maximizer of the @xmath0-fair utility function satisfies the definition of @xmath0-fairness .",
    "two well - known examples are as follows : a maximizer of the log utility function ( @xmath6 ) is proportionally fair , and a maximizer of the @xmath0-fair utility function with @xmath7 is max - min fair .",
    "more recently , @xmath0-fair utility functions have also been connected to divergence measures  @xcite , and in  @xcite , the parameter @xmath0 was viewed as a fairness measure in the sense that a fairer allocation is one that is the maximizer of an @xmath0-fair utility function with larger @xmath0  although the exact role of @xmath0 in trading - off fairness and throughput can sometimes be surprising  @xcite . while it is often held that @xmath8 is more fair than @xmath6 , which is in turn more fair than @xmath9 , it remains unclear what it means to say that @xmath10 is more fair than @xmath11 .    clearly , these two approaches for quantifying fairness are different . on the one hand ,",
    "@xmath0-fair utility functions are continuous and strictly increasing in each entry of @xmath4 , thus its maximization results in pareto optimal resource allocations . on the other hand ,",
    "scale - invariant fairness measures ( ones that map @xmath4 to the same value as a normalized @xmath4 ) are unaffected by the magnitude of @xmath4 , and an allocation that does not use all the resources can be as fair as one that does .",
    "can the two approaches be unified ?    to address the above questions , we develop an axiomatic approach to measure fairness .",
    "we discover that a set of five axioms , each of which simple and intuitive , can lead to a useful family of fairness measures .",
    "the axioms are : the axiom of continuity , of homogeneity , of asymptotic saturation , of irrelevance of partition , and of monotonicity . starting with these five axioms , we can _ generate _ a family of fairness measures from a generator function @xmath12 : any increasing and continuous function that leads to a well - defined `` mean '' function , i.e. , any kolmogorov - nagumo function @xcite .",
    "for example , using power functions with exponent @xmath13 as the generator function , we derive a unique family of fairness measures @xmath14 that includes all of the following as special cases , depending on the choice of @xmath13 : jain s index , maximum or minimum ratio , entropy , and @xmath0-fair utility , and reveals new fairness measures corresponding to other ranges of @xmath13 .    in particular , for @xmath15 , well - known fairness measures ( e.g. , jain s index and entropy ) are special cases of our construction , and we generalize jain s index to provide a flexible tradeoff between `` resolution '' and `` strictness '' of the fairness measure .",
    "for @xmath16 , @xmath0-fair utility functions can be factorized as the product of two components : our fairness measure with @xmath17 and a function of the total throughput that captures the scale , or efficiency , of @xmath4 .",
    "such a factorization also quantifies a tradeoff between fairness and efficiency in achieving pareto dominance with the maximum possible @xmath0 , and facilitates a clearer understanding of what it means to say that a larger @xmath0 is `` more fair '' for general @xmath18 .",
    "the axiomatic construction of fairness measures also illuminates their engineering implications .",
    "any fairness measure satisfying the five axioms can be proven to have many useful properties , including schur - concavity  @xcite .",
    "consequently , any operation balancing resources between two user always results in a higher fairness value , extending previous results using majorization to characterize fairness  @xcite .",
    "the development of an axiomatic theory of fairness takes another turn towards the end of the paper . by removing the axiom of homogeneity",
    ", we propose an alternative set of four axioms , which allows efficiency of resource allocation be jointly captured in the fairness measure .",
    "we show how this alternative system connects with constrained optimization based resource allocation , where magnitude matters due to the feasibility constraint and an objective function that favors efficiency .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : the five axioms for fairness measures are introduced and discussed in section  ii .",
    "schur - concavity and other properties are proven for any fairness measure satisfying the five axioms in section  iii .",
    "we construct a unique family of fairness measures in section  iv and discuss its relation to previous work .",

    "vii we propose a second set of axioms that directly incorporates a notion of efficiency .",
