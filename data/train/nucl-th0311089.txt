    "these high - energy contributions are relatively small for the hper dr and isovector amplitudes , but are important for the isoscalar e@xmath65 and c@xmath65 amplitudes . in these latter cases , while high - energy contributions were necessary to achieve sufficient convergence , the various forms of parameterization  @xcite yielded negligible differences in the dr constraints .",
    "as mentioned above , drs contain a number of parameters which are _ a priori _ unknown , namely the various subtraction constants ( if inserted for convergence of the dr integrals ) and the @xmath4 coupling constant @xmath66 ( when the born term appears ) .",
    "these constants are considered free parameters to be determined from the fits to the data and the dr constraints . in principle , these subtraction constants can be determined at any energy .",
    "we fix them at the physical threshold for the forward drs , and at the unphysical points c@xmath67 for the fixed - t c@xmath57 drs .",
    "the former can be expressed in terms of the s - wave scattering lengths a@xmath57 ( c@xmath57 drs ) and the p - wave scattering volumes a@xmath68 ( e@xmath57 drs ) .",
    "these parameters could be determined in a number of ways . in the present study , we settled on the following procedure : for a particular dr and data minimization run , the @xmath17 s - wave scattering length @xmath69 was fixed around precise results extracted from the psi pionic - atom experiment  @xcite , and the coupling constant @xmath70 and scattering volume @xmath71 were fixed at chosen values .",
    "in essence , the @xmath72 s - wave scattering length @xmath69 is used as an additional data point at threshold .",
    "the other parameters ( including the isovector s - wave scattering length @xmath73 ) were allowed to float freely . as a result ,",
    "the subtraction constant was fixed for the forward c@xmath65 and e@xmath65 drs , with real parts of the amplitudes forced to particular values in the analysis , whereas analogous constants for the other drs were allowed to find their own level .",
    "once a solution with minimal @xmath13 was determined , further runs were performed with new sets of fixed ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) values , producing a mapping over a grid of parameters .",
    "the solution fa02 was selected from this grid of solutions based on overall @xmath13 .",
    "generally , the @xmath13 variation of parameters is parabolic in the region near a minimum .",
    "the advantage of a grid method is that the depth of the ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) minimum in @xmath13 space indicates how well these parameters are determined .",
    "one can also view the dependence of the @xmath13 in each @xmath3n charge channel , or the dr pseudo - data , separately to look for systematic variations .",
    "we found the mapping procedure to be necessary for ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) due to computational instabilities which arise occasionally .",
    "one could , in principle , fix all the parameters and follow the above procedure over a multi - dimensional grid , and tests were done to investigate this , but it was found that the above procedure was sufficient to ensure stable fits with well - satisfied drs in all cases , while keeping the @xmath13 fit to the data optimal . adding more , or fixing more constraints , increases the data fit @xmath13 .      the partial - wave and dr analyses",
    "are performed using purely isospin - conserving hadronic amplitudes , so coulomb and other isospin - violating contributions must be introduced before constructing observables to compare to the physical pion - proton scattering data .",
    "there is no unique way to split the interaction into strong and electromagnetic parts  @xcite , so in general models must be used .    in previous analyses ,",
    "we have used a simple point - source barrier factor correction for all partial waves at all energies , as discussed in ref .",
    "the main isospin - violating contribution is the @xmath74 mass and width difference , which we have been treating phenomenologically by splitting the average resonant hadronic @xmath75 partial - wave into @xmath76 and @xmath77 waves for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath6 mass and width differences were found from a best fit to the data .",

    "the mass ( @xmath79 ) and width ( @xmath80 ) differences are 1.74@xmath810.15  mev and 1.09@xmath810.64  mev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the main criticism of point - source barrier factors is that they exaggerate the s - wave corrections at low energies , since the @xmath82 partial waves do not vanish at the origin , while the point - coulomb field diverges there .",
    "consequently , in this study , we have used the nordita   @xcite coulomb prescription , which was used for the karlsruhe - helsinki ( kh80 ) analyses  @xcite . however , the nordita work supplied corrections for only the largest s- and p - waves up to 530  mev , whereas our analysis extends to 2100  mev .",
    "the nordita corrections were therefore supplemented with corrections calculated from gibbs extended - source barrier factors  @xcite for s- and p- waves at energies above 450  mev , and d- and higher waves at all energies .",
    "the nordita and gibbs results were smoothly joined in the 450  mev region .",
    "as well , an error was found and corrected in the isospin mixing term in one nordita source  @xcite , while the pure coulomb part of the ( dominant ) resonant @xmath75 correction was reduced 15% to take into account intermediate @xmath83 exchange  @xcite , which was missing in the nordita work .    the nordita corrections already contain effects due to the @xmath84 mass difference . in this scheme",

    ", we have redefined our @xmath6(1232 ) resonance charge - splitting analogously .",

    "an exceptions appears to be the @xmath108 , which has a relatively weak coupling to @xmath27 states , and has an atypical resonance signature .",
    "the issue of charge symmetry violation ( csv ) is fundamental to our understanding of hadronic interactions , and many experimental and theoretical studies have addressed this issue ( see review   @xcite ) . in the framework of qcd",

    "the other principal cause for csv comes from the electromagnetic interaction , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : clmb ] .",
    "weinberg   @xcite pointed out that the effective chiral @xmath3n lagrangian , coming from qcd , contains a term which violates charge symmetry ( see also , a recent review by meissner  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , not only are there kinematic reasons for csv due to the mass differences within baryon multiplets , but direct csv effects should exist as well .",
    "recent analyzes  @xcite of the triangle identity in low - energy @xmath3n scattering ( below 70  mev ) data have found some indications for significant ( 6 - 7% ) direct csv effects in the strong - interaction sector  @xcite .",
    "fettes and meissner  @xcite have found a somewhat smaller violation ( @xmath242.5% ) in a third order chiral perturbation theory calculation without electromagnetic effects , and even smaller violations once the latter were included  @xcite .    because our formalism does not employ csv beyond the coulomb interaction , which we take into account in our treatment of the database , we have generated a test fit ( x370 ) of the full database excluding charge - exchange data .",
    "differences between fa02 and x370 are therefore signal incompatibilities between the elastic and charge - exchange data , which could be an indication of csv .    in table",

    "these tests for systematic effects improve our confidence in the values of parameters extracted from fa02",

    "this result should be taken into account by any multi - channel analysis which fits single - energy partial - wave amplitudes .",
    "our fits without dr constraints and without charge - exchange data have also yielded interesting results . in most cases , an extensive use of drs had little effect on the extracted resonance spectrum . for weak or non - canonical structures , however , dispersion relations may play a more important role .    in the absence of charge symmetry violation ( csv ) , beyond coulomb effects",
    ", one should be able to predict the charge - exchange observables based on a fit to elastic scattering data . in the low - energy region , where csv effects are expected to be most important ,",
    "our fit excluding charge - exchange data is reasonably predictive , and could be useful in a more refined study of this issue .",
    "an extensive list of tests designed to check for systematic effects ( changes to the database , coulomb - correction scheme ) has ( a ) revealed the dr parameters to be fairly robust with respect to these effects , and ( b ) suggested a way to quantify these systematic uncertainties .",

    "<S> we have also reexamined methods used to extract breit - wigner resonance parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of fit to both data and dispersion relation constraints is superior to our earlier work . </S>",
    "<S> the results of these analyses are compared with previous solutions in terms of their resonance spectra and preferred values for couplings and low - energy parameters , including the @xmath4 coupling constant . </S>"
