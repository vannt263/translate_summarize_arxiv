    "in the x - ray band , typically at a few kev , high degree of linear polarization is expected from high energy astrophysical objects where magnetic field or asymmetric geometry plays a key role in radiation or radiation transfer @xcite .",
    "x - ray polarimetry can help measure the magnetic field in supernova remnants and constrain the particle acceleration models @xcite .",
    "one can test the emission mechanism for rotation - powered pulsars @xcite , distinguish the fan model and pencil model for strongly magnetized accreting pulsars @xcite , and measure the geometry for millisecond pulsars @xcite , with phase resolved x - ray polarimetry .",
    "x - ray polarimetry for high synchrotron peaked blazars will be a powerful probe for the magnetic structure in relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "it is also useful to constrain the accretion disk inclination , which is needed for an unbiased estimate for the black hole spin @xcite , or test the symmetry for the comptonization corona around x - ray binaries or active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "sensitive x - ray polarimetry will open a new window in x - ray astronomy in addition to imaging , spectroscopy and timing @xcite .    due to the short wavelengths , x",
    "- rays are free of faraday rotation during propagation , which allows us to probe the innermost region where the emission arises . in the past",
    ", measurement of x - ray polarization is usually based on bragg diffraction or thomson scattering , which is either limited to a narrow band and/or of poor efficiency . to date , the only successful experiment was made in 1970s using mosaic graphite crystals onboard the oso-8 satellite .",
    "it obtained the first firm and positive result for the crab nebula @xcite , zero or low time - averaged polarization for sco x-1 and cyg x-1 @xcite , and loose upper limits for other sources @xcite .",
    "high sensitivity x - ray polarimetry still remains unexplored in astronomy due to the lack of technology .",
    "recently , with the development of micro - pattern gas detectors ( mpgds ) , sensitive x - ray polarimetry becomes possible by means of measuring photoelectron tracks following the absorption of x - rays in a gas detector @xcite .",
    "this is based on the fact that the emission angle of the photoelectron is dependent on the polarization angle of the incident photon . on the plane",
    "perpendicular to the photon direction , the emission angle for photoelectrons follows a @xmath1 distribution .",
    "the electron track length is on the order of millimeter , and only the initial part before significant scattering happens is useful for polarization measurement .",
    "mpgds like the gas electron multiplier ( gem ) detector with a position resolution close to 100 @xmath2 m was proven to be able to resolve the electron track and measure the x - ray polarization .",
    "mission concepts based on such techniques including the gravity and extreme magnetism smex ( gems ) @xcite and the x - ray imaging polarimetry explorer ( xipe ) @xcite were proposed .",
    "the techniques for gems and xipe are different .",
    "xipe uses pixel detectors that can directly image the photoelectron , which is intrinsically of low systematics @xcite .",
    "gems uses one dimensional time projection chambers ( tpcs ) and the photoelectron image is measured by different means in x and y ( i.e. , strip position and timing ) .",
    "the tpc polarimeter may have a higher efficiency but requires a huge amount of effort for calibration in order to reach a low systematic error as for the imaging polarimeter .",
    "thus , the two techniques may be used for different purposes .",
    "the imaging detector is suitable for extended sources like supernova remnants and bright objects with low polarization like the accreting x - ray binaries , while the tpc polarimeter is good for highly polarized but relatively faint objects .",
    "the x - ray timing and polarization ( xtp ) was proposed as a future observatory - class space mission concept in china , with an unprecedented sensitivity in x - ray polarimetry .",
    "a lot of its key science objectives will rely on x - ray polarimetry or joint analysis with spectroscopy , timing and polarimetry .",
    "the choice of polarization techniques is still under investigation .",
    "both the imaging and tpc polarimeters are currently under development at tsinghua university . in this paper",
    ", we will introduce a modified design of the tpc x - ray polarimeter based on the version for gems , which can compensate the low efficiency of gas detectors and maximize the utilization of the focal plane behind hard x - ray focusing telescopes .",
    "we will show the preliminary results obtained with a test chamber and the expected sensitivity in x - ray polarimetry .",
    "the optics of xtp includes multilayer coated mirrors , which are sensitive in the energy range up to 40 kev @xcite .",
    "there is no movable part on the focal plane of xtp .",
    "therefore , if a gas detector like a photoelectric x - ray polarimeter is mounted on the focal plane of high energy optics , it will be a huge waste for the high energy photons .",
    "the tpc polarimeter with a long absorption depth may have a higher quantum efficiency than the imaging polarimeter .",
    "however , due to the choice of a low pressure and low - z gas mixture , which is optimized for imaging the tracks for electrons of a few kev like the gems tpc polarimeter @xcite , the stopping power for photons above 10 kev is still low .    to overcome this problem",
    ", we propose to open a second , rear window on the tpc polarimeter , and mount it above the focal plane .",
    "thus , high energy photons that are mostly unabsorbed in the chamber can penetrate through it and be collected by other focal plane detectors , e.g , semiconductor arrays .",
    "a schematic drawing of the polarimeter design is shown in figure  [ fig : det ] .",
    "as the focal length is about 3.5 m for xtp , the beam is quasi - parallel and the beam size is still small and close to the focal spot size if the chamber is placed above the focal plane . along the light path",
    ", the sensitive volume is divided into several independent units , which are read out individually in order to increase the reliability and decrease the readout capacitance .",
    "each unit consists of a gem foil for signal amplification , one - dimensional strip electrodes for signal collection , and electronics including multi - channel high - frequency preamplifiers , shaping amplifiers , and a capacitor array for signal processing and storage .",

    "three titanium plates serve as the field cage to shape a uniform electric field which is necessary for electron drifting .",
    "the readout plate is a flexible printed circuit board containing 128 parallel strips with a pitch of 140  @xmath2 m , matching the spacing of hole rows in the same direction .",
    "the total readout region is 1.8 cm wide and 8 cm long .",
    "the signals collected by the strips are fed into the electronics in the air side of the chamber via a feedthrough that seals the flexible board .",
    "we adopt the pure dimethyl ether ( dme ) with a pressure of a quarter of atmosphere as the gas mixture .",
    "dme has the smallest transversal diffusion coefficient among commonly used gases for gaseous detectors @xcite .",
    "such a gas mixture has been proven viable for a tpc polarimeter @xcite . with three readout units ,",

    "<S> the x - ray timing and polarization ( xtp ) is a mission concept for a future space borne x - ray observatory and is currently selected for early phase study . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new design of x - ray polarimeter based on the time projection gas chamber . </S>",
    "<S> the polarimeter , placed above the focal plane , has an additional rear window that allows hard x - rays to penetrate ( a transmission of nearly 80% at 6 kev ) through it and reach the detector on the focal plane . </S>",
    "<S> such a design is to compensate the low detection efficiency of gas detectors , at a low cost of sensitivity , and can maximize the science return of multilayer hard x - ray telescopes without the risk of moving focal plane instruments . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity in terms of minimum detectable polarization , based on current instrument configuration , is expected to be 3% for a 1mcrab source given an observing time of @xmath0  s. we present preliminary test results , including photoelectron tracks and modulation curves , using a test chamber and polarized x - ray sources in the lab . </S>"
