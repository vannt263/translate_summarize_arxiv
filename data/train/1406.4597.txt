    "homological mirror symmetry conjecture by kontsevich @xcite asserts that for a pair of mirror manifolds @xmath3 , the derived fukaya category of lagrangian submanifolds in @xmath0 is equivalent to the derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath4 .",
    "the study of homological mirror symmetry leads to many new insights to fukaya categories and computational techniques for proving the conjecture in various cases .",
    "more generally when @xmath0 is not required to be calabi - yau , the mirror of @xmath0 is a landau - ginzburg model @xmath1 , which is a holomorphic function rather than a manifold . intuitively , the singular locus of @xmath1 ( which is not necessarily smooth nor connected ) is the space mirror to @xmath0 .",
    "homological mirror symmetry can still be stated by using the category of matrix factorizations of @xmath1 @xcite ( in place of the derived category of coherent sheaves ) , or the fukaya - seidel category of @xmath1 @xcite ( in place of the fukaya category ) .    in @xcite , we proposed and constructed a functor to realize homological mirror symmetry using immersed lagrangian floer theory .",
    "we used the formal deformations and obstructions coming from the self - intersections of a fixed lagrangian immersion @xmath5 in @xmath0 to construct a floer potential which serves as a landau - ginzburg mirror @xmath1 .",
    "given any lagrangian @xmath6 in the fukaya category , the lagrangian intersection theory between the immersion @xmath5 and @xmath6 is used to construct the mirror object @xmath7 of @xmath6 . by the result of orlov @xcite , for a landau - ginzburg model @xmath1 ,",
    "the appropriate objects to consider for singularity theory of @xmath1 are matrix factorizations , which are endomorphisms @xmath7 of vector bundles satisfying @xmath8 for some constant @xmath9 . in @xcite",
    "the theory was applied to the orbifold spheres @xmath10 , and an inductive method was found in @xcite to deduce an explicit expression of the landau - ginzburg mirror @xmath1 ( which contains infinitely many terms ) .    in this paper , we fix the reference to be a smooth lagrangian torus @xmath5 rather than an immersed lagrangian .",
    "is a torus is actually not essential .",
    "we concentrate on torus because it plays a central role in syz mirror symmetry . ] for simplicity we make the technical assumption that @xmath11 is positive ( see assumption [ assum1 ] ) , although this is not necessary if one uses the full machinery of lagrangian floer theory .",
    "similar to @xcite , we use lagrangian intersection theory to construct a landau - ginzburg model @xmath12 and an @xmath2-functor from the fukaya category to the category of matrix factorizations of @xmath1 .",
    "flat @xmath13 connections plays a key role in this setup , since they serve as the formal ( complexified ) deformations of @xmath5 .",
    "the essential issue coming from considering flat @xmath13 connections , rather than self - intersections of an immersion , is the choice of gauge .",
    "different choices of gauge for the same connection result in different expressions of the functor , and we need to make a consistent choice to make sure the functor is well - defined , and study the effect of gauge change .",
    "the fundamental idea of constructing a mirror functor for a lagrangian torus fibration ( with mild singularities ) goes back to the work of fukaya @xcite , @xcite , who introduced family floer homology of lagrangian torus fibers under certain assumptions .",
    "more recently , abouzaid @xcite studied the family floer theory for lagrangian torus fibration without singular fibers .",
    "the mirror functor constructed in this paper is a local piece of the family floer functor near a lagrangian torus fiber @xmath5 , which has the advantage that it can be explicitly computed . in the absence of singular fibers such as in the case of toric manifolds",
    ", these local pieces can be glued together to give the global functor .",
    "we summarize the construction as follows .",
    "first fix a weakly unobstructed smooth lagrangian torus @xmath5 in a symplectic manifold @xmath0 .",
    "we define a holomorphic function @xmath1 on the space @xmath14 of flat @xmath13-connections @xmath15 by using the @xmath16-term of the @xmath2 algebra @xmath17 .",
    "geometrically @xmath1 is obtained from counting holomorphic discs of maslov index two bounded by @xmath18 ( see definition [ def : w ] ) .",
    "in general @xmath1 should serve as a part of a global landau - ginzburg mirror to @xmath0 .",
    "this method was used by the joint work @xcite of the first author with oh , and fukaya - oh - ohta - ono @xcite to construct the mirrors of toric manifolds .",
    "now comes the main construction of this paper . to transform a ( weakly unobstructed )",
    "lagrangian @xmath6 to a matrix factorization , we take the lagrangian floer ` complex ' between @xmath18 and @xmath6 .",
    "the differential does not square to zero ; indeed it follows from the @xmath19 relations that the differential squares to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 , and thereby the lagrangian floer ` complex ' is indeed a matrix factorization of @xmath1 .",
    "the strategy of constructing matrix factorizations using lagrangian floer theory was found by oh @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that the same flat connection @xmath15 admits different choices of gauge .",
    "the resulting matrix factorizations depend on such a choice",
    ". moreover terms like @xmath23 for @xmath24 could appear if the gauge is chosen arbitrarily . to make sure",
    "the resulting matrix factorizations are still defined over the laurent series ring , we make the following gauge choice for the flat connections over @xmath5 .",
    "namely , we always require that the flat connections are trivial away from small neighborhoods of certain fixed codimension - one tori ( called hyper - tori ) .",
    "then holonomy of a flat connection over a path in @xmath5 can be expressed in terms of the number of intersections of the path with the hyper - tori , which are integer - valued .",
    "it ensures that we still stay inside the laurent series ring .",
    "moreover , we can show that the resulting matrix factorization does not depend on the choice of hyper - tori , nor a representative in the hamiltonian isotopy class of @xmath6 ( see section [ sec : inv ] ) . as a result",
    ", we have the following .    [ thm : intro - f ] fix a smooth lagrangian submanifold @xmath25 .",
    "there exists a floer potential @xmath1 defined over the space of flat @xmath13 connections over @xmath5 , and an @xmath19 functor from @xmath26 to @xmath27 for each @xmath28 , where @xmath26 is the fukaya category of weakly unobstructed lagrangian submanifolds @xmath29 with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 denotes the novikov field .",
    "the mirror functor is computable by using _ pearl complex",
    "_ introduced by biran - cornea @xcite ( decorated with flat complex line bundles for the purpose of this paper ) , which is explained in section [ sec : pearl ] .    in section [ sec : toricfano ] , we apply our construction to toric fano manifolds , and transform lagrangian torus fibers ( decorated by flat connections ) to matrix factorizations of the mirror . even though the hori - vafa mirror @xmath1 has only finitely many terms , the mirror matrix factorizations @xmath7 have infinitely many terms in general and are hard to write down explicitly . on the other hand , we find that the leading - order terms of such a matrix factorization @xmath7 always form another matrix factorization @xmath32 .",
    "we deduce an explicit closed formula for @xmath32 and show that it is of _ wedge - contraction type _ , and hence it is a generator of the category of matrix factorizations by the result of dyckerhoff @xcite .",

    "* proposition 8.3.3 ) ) and @xcite . in this case , sign differences from ( i ) and ( ii ) are both @xmath1281 and and cancel each other .",
    "we claim that the sign of this inclusion is @xmath1282 when @xmath1283 .",
    "first , the inclusion from @xcite has sign @xmath1280 , with an additional sign @xmath1281 from ( i ) .",
    "now , in this case , it is not hard to compute the effect of switching of two factors ( from ( ii ) ) and find that there is no additional sign contribution from this .",
    "this will be needed for the sign of the second term in .    here , we orient @xmath29 so that we have @xmath1284 .",
    "consequently , the sign of @xmath1271 in the equation ( induced by ) is @xmath1285 , according to the sign rule of @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath1286 or equivalently , @xmath1287 .",
    "we first make the following the sign convention for the morse - differential @xmath1288 .",
    "we first choose the orientation of stable manifolds of @xmath768 as @xmath1289 where @xmath1290 for @xmath1291 with @xmath1292 .",

    "then , we have @xmath1297 now consider the moduli space @xmath1298 of negative gradient flow lines from @xmath1299 to @xmath167 , which is oriented as an intersection @xmath1300 ( see subsection [ ss : sign ] for sign convention ) . for @xmath1301 , let @xmath1302 be the direction of the flow of @xmath225 .",

    "we now analyze the sign of a flow line @xmath225 from @xmath768 to @xmath809 . the one which passes through @xmath812",
    "has tangent vector @xmath1306 , and the one which passes through @xmath813 has tangent vector @xmath1307 .",
    "first consider the case @xmath1308 ( when @xmath1309 , @xmath1310 ) . by our choice of orientations for unstable submanifolds , the splitting @xmath1311 preserves orientation if @xmath1306 and reverses orientation if @xmath1307 . hence excluding the factor @xmath1312",

    "the moduli space of such pearl trajectories is oriented as @xmath1323 ( see section [ ss : sign ] ) . in the toric cases , we can equip the lagrangian torus @xmath5 with the standard spin structure and if @xmath841 is a basic disc class , then we have that @xmath1324 is an orientation preserving homeomorphism .",
    "( this follows from proposition 8.1 @xcite since we take the opposite orientation of both @xmath1325 and @xmath5 compared to that of @xcite . ) hence , @xmath1326 and we have @xmath1327 and hence @xmath1328    since @xmath1329 , it suffices to compare the orientations on @xmath1330 and @xmath1331 .",
