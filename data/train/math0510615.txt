    "then , by lemma  [ newniceflag ] , we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath640 .",
    "but then @xmath641 would be a non - splitting flag of rank @xmath628 in @xmath15 , a contradiction .",
    "hence , by inductive hypothesis , @xmath629 has a homogeneous , non dual - defect flat @xmath71 of rank at least two and such that @xmath642 .",
    "therefore , @xmath71 is a flat in @xmath15 as well and the proof is complete .",
    "we return now to the proof of theorem  [ th : decomposition ] .",
    "we prove the existence of ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) by induction on the rank @xmath13 . if @xmath587 then , being irreducible , @xmath15 is not dual defect and we may take @xmath643 .",

    "we may assume that @xmath121 is not contained in any larger , homogeneous , non dual - defect @xmath15-flat and @xmath645 . let @xmath646 .",
    "clearly , @xmath480 is homogeneous and irreducible .",
    "if @xmath480 is not dual defect then taking @xmath647 we are done . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath480 is dual defect and of rank less than @xmath13 , then we may apply the inductive hypothesis to write @xmath648 where the @xmath649 are maximal , homogeneous , disjoint , non dual - defect subconfigurations of @xmath480 and , for @xmath650 , @xmath578 is a flat in @xmath651 . finally , if @xmath652 , we repeat the argument and write @xmath480 as a disjoint union @xmath653 , where @xmath122 is a homogeneous non dual - defect @xmath480 flat .",
    "since at each step the cardinality of the remaining homogeneous configuration @xmath654 strictly decreases , it is clear that this process terminates .",
    "clearly , this would imply the result since the distinct flats among the @xmath660 , @xmath661 would define a non - splitting flag in @xmath578 whose rank would , therefore , be bounded by @xmath662 . to prove the claim we proceed by induction on @xmath663 .",
    "if @xmath664 , then we may assume @xmath665 and it suffices to choose @xmath666 and @xmath667 for @xmath668 .",
    "suppose now that we have constructed @xmath669 , @xmath670 and set @xmath671 .",
    "then @xmath672 is the disjoint union of the @xmath578-flats @xmath673 , for @xmath670 .",
    "let @xmath674 be the first index such that @xmath675 .",
    "such an index exists since @xmath430 is a non - splitting flag . since @xmath675 , there exists a @xmath676-flat @xmath677 such that @xmath678 and @xmath679 . set @xmath659 for @xmath680 .",
    "note that since @xmath681 @xmath682 must be strictly larger than @xmath683 .",
    "hence @xmath684 and , for dimensional reasons , this must be a direct sum .",
    "we have shown in theorem  [ four - classif ] that if @xmath233 is a dual defect homogeneous configuration of codimension four , which is not a pyramid , and @xmath15 is a gale dual then either @xmath15 is degenerate or @xmath685 , and @xmath575 and @xmath576 are complementary planes . in this case , if @xmath686 is a dual of @xmath232 then @xmath686 is a union of homogeneous , codimension - two configurations lying in complementary subspaces of @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath15 is a degenerate configuration consisting of vectors in a splitting line and in a complementary three - dimensional space , then @xmath0 is a union of two homogeneous configurations , of codimension one and three respectively , lying in complementary subspaces of @xmath3 . in either case",
    ", the projective toric variety @xmath9 is obtained from a join of two varieties by attaching codimension - one configurations according to ( [ specialform ] ) .",
    "more generally , if @xmath15 is decomposed as in ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) and @xmath0 is a dual of @xmath15 , then @xmath0 will be a cayley configuration of @xmath546 configurations @xmath687 in @xmath688 , where @xmath689 , in the following sense :      in the special case when @xmath695 , as in theorem  [ th : decomposition ] , is an irreducible configuration such that @xmath696 then , if @xmath233 is dual to @xmath15 , the toric variety @xmath9 is a join of varieties @xmath697 lying in disjoint linear subspaces and the dual variety @xmath698 has codimension @xmath546 .",
    "however , as the following example shows , for codimension greater than four , it is no longer true that every dual defect toric variety is obtained from a join by attaching codimension - one configurations according to ( [ specialform ] ) .",
    "* example .",
    "* let @xmath0 be the cayley configuration in @xmath699 , @xmath700 the variety @xmath9 is a smooth three - fold in @xmath701 .",
    "it is easy to show that a gale dual @xmath702 may be decomposed as @xmath703 , where @xmath578 is an irreducible , homogeneous , codimension - two configuration and , therefore , non dual - defect .",
    "let @xmath704 be as in ( [ eq : decomposition2 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath705 and , by theorem  [ th : decomposition ] , @xmath15 is dual defect . in fact using theorem  [ tropical ] one can show that @xmath698 is a six - dimensional subvariety of @xmath701 .",
    "di rocco has obtained a classification of dual defect projective embeddings of smooth toric varieties in terms of their associated polytopes @xcite .",
    "recall that a homogeneous configuration @xmath0 is said to be _ saturated _ if @xmath47 consists of all the integer points of a @xmath43 dimensional polytope with integer vertices , @xmath506 , lying on a hyperplane off the origin .",
    "moreover , the projective toric variety @xmath9 is smooth , if and only if the polytope @xmath506 is _ delzant _ , that is , for each vertex @xmath706 of @xmath506 , there exist @xmath707 such that @xmath708 is a lattice basis of @xmath3 , and @xmath709 near @xmath706 .",
    "it is well known that projective embeddings of smooth toric varieties are in one - to - one correspondence with delzant polytopes .",
    "[ dir - classif ] let @xmath0 be a saturated , homogeneous , configuration in @xmath3 which is not a pyramid and such that @xmath710 is delzant .",
    "then @xmath0 is dual defect if and only if @xmath711 where @xmath301 is such that @xmath712 , @xmath694 are saturated and the polytopes @xmath713 are all delzant polytopes of the same combinatorial type .",
    "thus , we see that the smoothness condition puts very strong conditions on the type of cayley configuration we may consider . to illustrate this , we will list all smooth dual defect projective toric varieties of codimension at most four .",
    "we note first of all that in these cases , the configurations @xmath714 in theorem  [ dir - classif ] must be one - dimensional .",
    "in fact , let @xmath0 be a dual defect , saturated , homogeneous , configuration in @xmath3 which is not a pyramid and such that @xmath710 is delzant , and write @xmath715 as in theorem  [ dir - classif ] . then , if @xmath716 , each polytope @xmath717 must be one - dimensional .",
    "indeed , let us consider the simplest case when the polytopes @xmath717 are two - dimensional .",
    "then @xmath718 and since by assumption @xmath719 , we must have @xmath720 .",
    "the fewest number of integral points in a delzant polytope in @xmath721 is three .",
    "hence @xmath722 and @xmath723 .",
    "let @xmath724 $ ] denote the configuration @xmath725 .",
    "an easy counting argument now shows that the smooth dual defect toric varieties of codimension less than or equal to four are the ones associated with the cayley configurations listed below :            the gale duals of the configurations in the above list are easily computed . indeed , it is easy to see that each cayley factor @xmath727 $ ] contributes a splitting line containing two vectors from @xmath15 , and this vectors are primitive relative to the lattice @xmath76 .",
