    "it is well known that bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with weak attractive interactions between atoms can form stable solitons in  cigar - shaped \" ( nearly one - dimensional , 1d ) traps . in these traps , the gas is strongly bound in the transverse plane , while being loosely confined along the longitudinal axis ( @xmath0 ) . using this configuration ,",
    "stable bright solitons were created in the gas of @xmath1li atoms @xcite . in the condensate of @xmath2rb atoms",
    "trapped in a similar configuration , stronger attraction between atoms leads to collapse and emergence of nearly 3d solitons in a _ post - collapse _ state @xcite .",
    "the strongly elongated ( cigar - shaped ) settings are described by effectively 1d equations which were derived , by dint of various approximations , from the full 3d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the derivation assumes an _ ansatz _ factorizing the 3d wave function into a product of a transverse mode and an axial ( one - dimensional ) wave function . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the substitution of the factorized ansatz in the underlying cubic gpe leads , in the general situation , to a _ nonpolynomial schrdinger equation _ ( npse ) for the axial wave function ( or a system of coupled npses for a two - component bec @xcite ) . in the case of weak nonlinearity",
    ", the npse can be expanded , which leads to a simplified 1d equation with a combination of cubic and quintic terms , the latter one being always _ attractive _ ; if the cubic term is attractive too , the cubic - quintic equation gives rise to a family of stable solitons available in an exact analytical form @xcite .",
    "unlike the ordinary 1d nonlinear schrdinger ( nls )  equation with the attractive cubic term , the npse , as well as its cubic - quintic truncation , may give rise to collapse , which reflects the occurrence of the collapse in the underlying cubic gpe in three dimensions @xcite . despite the possibility of the collapse , solitons are stable in these models .",

    "although the gap solitons can not play the role of ground states , they , as well as the ground - state solitons , are stable in direct simulations of the time - dependent variant of the npse equation .",

    "in this work , we have derived the effective one - dimensional npse ( nonpolynomial schrdinger equation ) for a cigar - shaped trap whose transverse confining frequency is periodically modulated along the axial direction , thus inducing an effective periodic axial potential .",
    "besides the usual quasi-1d linear geometry , the model may also be relevant as a means of creating an effective periodic potential in toroidal traps . in both cases of the repulsive and attractive nonlinearity ,",
    "delocalized states and solitons were found , by means of numerical methods ( which were applied to both the effective npse and the underlying 3d gross - pitaevskii equation ) and va ( variational approximation ; this method was applied to ground - state solitons in the model with attraction , and to the prediction of the collapse threshold in this case ) .",
    "it was found that the numerical solution to the npse is always extremely close to the full 3d solutions .",
    "the va yields quite reasonable results too , except for the description of the crossover from single - site to multi - site solitons : numerical results reveal that the crossover is smooth and does not include a jump , contrary to the prediction of the va .",
    "this shortcoming of the va is explained by the fact that the simple gaussian ansatz , on which the approximation is based , can not adequately grasp the transition that alters the shape of the soliton , giving it the multi - peaked structure .",
    "the transition from delocalized states to gap solitons was studied in detail ( by means of numerical methods ) in the first finite bandgap , for both cases of the repulsive and attractive nonlinearities .",
    "the above results , presented in terms of the dimensionless equations , can be easily translated into physical units .",
    "for instance , by considering an attractive bose - einstein condensate made of @xmath1li atoms , with scattering length @xmath212 nm , and choosing the transverse confining frequency as @xmath213 hz , we have a typical value of the modulation period , @xmath214 @xmath41 m , for @xmath71 ( recall it was a typical value for which the results were reported above ) . in this case",
    "the critical number of atoms at the collapse threshold is @xmath215",
