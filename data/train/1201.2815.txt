    "the radiation of the non - relativistic electron bunch moving parallel to the diffraction grating has been investigated in the experiment of smith and purcell @xcite . emitted wavelength dependence on the grating constant , bunch speed and the radiation angle is derived from the huygens principle . as it is shown in @xcite",
    "that dependence coincides with the oscillator radiation characteristic .",
    "an anomalously high radiation intensity has been observed during the investigations of the transition radiation of the non - relativistic electron bunch grazing into a metal surface @xcite .",
    "later that anomaly has been proved in the experiment @xcite . in the experiment @xcite",
    "the authors have concluded that the anomaly is conditioned by the surface roughness .",
    "the right explanation of that phenomenon has been given in @xcite , where the radiation of the non - relativistic electron grazing into a rough metal surface has been presented as a mixture of the transition radiation and the undulator radiation conditioned by the random oscillations of the electron .",
    "in that work the random fields have been described by the gaussian distribution . in the present work",
    "the case when the bunch electrons oscillate in the planes parallel to the metallic surface has been considered and gamma distribution has been chosen to describe the random roughness of the metal surface .",
    "it s important for the applications to develop non - destructive methods for investigation of the metallic rough surfaces ( see for example @xcite ) .",

    "electrons move along @xmath0 direction and oscillate along @xmath1 direction .",
    "the distance between two asperities is @xmath2 , which is also the spatial semiperiod of the electron motion .",
    "here we give the electron path by the following formula :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the amplitude of the trajectory .",
    "as it is already mentioned above the trajectory should be a smooth curve for which we require the derivatives of two sins at the embroidering point be equal to each other . from that requirement",
    "it is easy to find the condition :    @xmath5    which gives a relationship between amplitude and spatial semiperiod . here",
    "the following fact is very important .",
    "the bunch has a big number of electrons and at the given point of space and at the given moment of time we have photons radiated from the electrons which move along trajectories with different @xmath2 . generally speaking at the other moments of time the given electron may move along the trajectory with some other @xmath2 but at that moment with his previous @xmath2",

    "it s clear that for us it s not important from which electron the given photon has been emitted . from the mentioned feature it follows that we can assume that every electron moves along a trajectory with a constant @xmath2",

    "one is able to find the angular distribution of the number of radiated photons from a single electron which moves along a trajectory with a spatial semiperiod @xmath31 by taking into account that @xmath32 and by integrating ( 9 ) with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath16 .",
    "one can notice that as a result of integration @xmath2 is being replaced with an expression which depends on @xmath15 .",

    "after simple transformations introducing the following non - dimensional frequency :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the mean value of the spatial semiperiods of the bunch electron trajectories ( detailed information about the distribution of @xmath31 is given in the next paragraph ) , for the frequency distribution one will get :    @xmath39 ,    k=\\frac{\\alpha l \\pi^3q^2}{32\\langle l \\rangle},\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 . if the @xmath31 of the electron is constant then @xmath41 and ( 12 ) coincides with the first harmonic spectrum of the undulator radiation in the vacuum @xcite . because the argument of the delta function ( 9 ) is zero and the cosine function is limited one has @xmath42 in the @xmath43 interval .",
