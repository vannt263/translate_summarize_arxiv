    "in the recent past , there have been a number of developments in the field of information processing and computer science that were triggered by insights originating from statistical mechanics .",
    "a number of them was initiated after the discovery of the close relationship between the sum - product algorithm or loopy belief propagation @xcite in computer science on the one hand , and the bethe approximation , the cavity method and the replica method in statistical mechanics on the other hand . @xcite .",
    "the belief propagation algorithm is a method to compute approximations of the microstate probability distribution or the corresponding marginals of variables that interact on a given graph .",
    "this objective arises in various statistical inference problems with which the machine learning community is concerned , such as stereo vision @xcite , optimization problems @xcite , image restoration @xcite , digital zoom and shape - from - shading @xcite , error correcting codes for telecommunication @xcite , human movement modelling @xcite , protein folding @xcite evaluating postitions in the game of go @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the field of statistical mechanics , the main interest is the macroscopic behaviour of systems , and thus the objective is the calculation of macroscopic observables describing ensemble averages over graphs distributed according to a given measure . in the limit of infinite system size ,",
    "the macroscopic observables for a given instance of a graph coincides with the ensemble average in many models of interest .",
    "the cavity method for sparse random graphs may be viewed as the macroscopic counterpart of belief propagation .",
    "if belief propagation converges , the cavity method describes its macroscopic statistics in the limit of infinite system size @xcite .",
    "a more careful interpretation is needed when belief propagation ceases to converge , and in this case more exotic statistical mechanics techniques can play a crucial role in generalizations of the belief propagation algorithm .",
    "when belief propagation ( bp ) breaks down , one may distinguish between different possible causes for this failure .",
    "one of these possible causes is replica symmetry breaking , related to the breaking of ergodicity .",
    "this is reflected by a free energy landscape exhibiting a structure of a large number of free energy valleys that are disconnected , in the sense that the correlations between them are smaller than correlations within one valley , and the free energy barriers between valleys are extensive .",
    "a generalisation of the cavity method on sparse graphs has been developed to take into account a first step of replica symmetry breaking @xcite over the last years .",
    "although this scheme was designed for the computation of macroscopic observables , i.e. averages over ensembles , it could be adapted to yield an algorithm that gives valuable new information on specific instances of hard optimization problems : survey propagation @xcite .",
    "survey propagation ( sp ) has proved to be a succesful algorithm which can cope with hard constraint satisfaction problems such as random 3-satisfiability and graph colouring @xcite .",
    "these problems become hard when the solution space breaks apart in disconnected components , such that the relative sizes of the basins of attraction corresponding to these solutions for algorithms like ordinary belief propagation vanish and many suboptimal fixed points appear . loosely speaking",
    ", the basic idea of survey propagation is to gather the statistics of the fixed points that correspond to solutions of the constraint satisfaction problem .",
    "these `` surveys '' ( probability distributions associated to each link of the graph ) may be used for decimation of the original constraint satisfaction problem , until the problem is reduced to a sufficiently easy one that can be solved with a conventional algorithm .",
    "one of the reasons why sp is so succesful is the fact that it corresponds to a zero - temperature problem in statistical mechanics , having the consequence that the `` surveys '' , which represent probability distributions , have a very efficient parametrization .",
    "this makes it possible to study very large graph instances .",
    "the 1 step replica symmetry broken ( 1rsb ) version of the cavity method is applicable to finite temperature cases as well @xcite , suggesting a possible potential for the algorithmic counterpart on a specific instance .",
    "the benefit aimed at is that in cases where the free energy landscape is complex and belief propagation itself does not converge , the surveys provide sufficient information leading to improved marginal approximations .",
    "however , various difficulties , some practical and some technical , must be taken into account , which we will shortly list here , to be discussed more thoroughly later in the text :    * the surveys we will be dealing with are not efficiently parametrized , since they can take values on a continuous interval .",
    "we will be forced to sample from distributions , which severely limits the system sizes .",
    "for infinite values of the connectivity of the corresponding graphs , more efficient representations become possible , as suggested in @xcite . *",
    "given that we have a limited system size , we must remember that the approach is likely to be sensitive to finite size effects .",
    "one of the issues is the optimization of the free energy with respect to the replica symmetry breaking parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this may be interpreted as zooming in at the states with the lowest free energy , where , moreover , the `` complexity '' ( entropy of states ) vanishes in a truly 1rsb scenario .",
    "it is questionable what remains of this idea for a small system size . *",
    "it is not straightforward to test the performance of the algorithm : if the output of the algorithm is a set of approximate single - spin marginal probabilities , how can we judge the quality of this approximation ?",
    "comparing to exact results is possible for very small system sizes only ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "* we should take into account the possibility of further steps of replica symmetry breaking , which might prevent the algorithm from converging , or cause malfunction in a different manner .",
    "the above complications show that our expectations regarding an algorithm based on the 1rsb generalisation of the cavity method should be modest . however , in the current paper we present encourageing results , indicating that there is at least a possible type of application , albeit for future generations of fast computers , in the field of error correcting codes .",
    "this point has very recently been recognized and suggested by migliorini and saad @xcite for ldpc codes , where the authors argued that a 1rsb type algorithm might increase the dynamical limit of the channel noise for decoding . in this paper",
    "we for the first time propose such an algorithm for the biased finite connectivity sourlas code with @xmath2-spin interactions .",
    "we show how a finite temperature survey propagation algorithm gives accurate results in the regime where competing approaches fail to converge or fail to recover the encoded message .",
    "the suggested algorithm may be used for finite temperature decoding of encrypted messages , where the single spin marginals are the basis for inference of original message bit values .",
    "a corresponding performance measure of the algorithm is the bit error rate , which is easily calculated .",
    "thereby the required knowledge of exact values of marginals is circumvented and one is not limited to small system sizes .",
    "the model we will study is a biased finite connectivity sourlas code with @xmath2-spin interactions .",
    "this model is closely related to a general @xmath2-spin model with external fields .    in the next sections we will introduce the general model class of ising @xmath2-spin systems with external fields ,",
    "we will shortly review belief propagation , the cavity method and it s 1rsb generalization , and finally describe the finite temperature generalization of survey propagation . exact comparison of marginals is only possible for limited system sizes ( @xmath3 using a junction tree algorithm @xcite ) , which indeed turned out to be too small to see any improvement in a few cases we studied .",
    "therefore we consider , as a toy model , finite temperature decoding of the finite connectivity sourlas error correcting code based on 3-spin interactions . as was also pointed out for the case of a cdma model in @xcite , when decoding happens without the knowledge of the channel noise , one may suffer from replica symmetry breaking effects if the adopted estimate of the channel noise is below the nishimori temperature @xcite .",
    "the appearance of metastable states disrupts the behaviour of simple message passing algorithms before the onset of replica symmetry breaking of the equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , in @xcite it was proposed that a 1rsb type algorithm might be able to increase the critical noise value for the decoding dynamics as compared to rs type decoding algorithms .",
    "although the formalism may be set up in a more general fashion , we will be focussing on systems of @xmath4 binary variables @xmath5 , @xmath6 that interact on a random graph , where the order of the interaction is @xmath2",
    ". the equilibrium microstate probability distribution will be described by the boltzmann measure @xmath7}{\\sum_{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\tau$ } } } \\exp[-\\beta h({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\tau$}})]}\\ ] ] where the hamiltonian is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "greek letters @xmath10 will label interaction vertices ( factors in a factor graph representation ) , @xmath11 label spins in @xmath12 , the set of site indices contained in interaction @xmath13 .",
    "we will be discussing random graphs with fixed connectivity , i.e. the number of interactions for spin @xmath14 , @xmath15 , will be fixed and equal for all @xmath14 , where @xmath16 is the set of all interactions containing @xmath14 , i.e. , we will choose @xmath17 from now on .",
    "consequently , the sum over @xmath13 in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) runs from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , the total number of interactions .    in a statistical inference problem",
    ", we assume the values of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are known , and the objective is the calculation of the partition sum , or of a marginalized probability , e.g. @xmath23 in general the calculation of this quantity requires @xmath24 operations , and thus for large @xmath4 one resorts to approximations .    in the regime of finite connectivity ,",
    "the average loop length is of order @xmath25 , such that for large system sizes , correlations that propagate through loops may be neglected if the couplings are of order @xmath26 . in this regime",
    "the bethe approximation , which is exact on tree graphs , performs well .",
    "consequently , the cavity method gives rather accurate results , as long as the system is in a single state , and belief propagation is a good candidate for inference on a ( large ) single instance .",
    "@xcite . for large values of @xmath22 ( low temperature values ) , replica symmetry",
    "breaking occurs , and a single state cavity method description is no longer accurate .",
    "belief propagation ceases to converge , or gets trapped in a sub - optimal free energy minimum @xcite , and does not give any information . in the absence of external fields , it has been shown that the 3-spin model with interactions @xmath27 is self - consistently described within the 1rsb cavity framework @xcite , for a fixed number of interactions per spin .",
    "the cavity method @xcite in it s simple form is based on two assumptions :    * the values of the spins @xmath28 that are neighbours on the graph of site @xmath14 are only nontrivially correlated through the interaction @xmath29 with site @xmath14 . * in equilibrium , the system is in a single state ( there is just one dominant free energy valley ) , i.e. there is a one to one correspondence between the states of neighbouring spins    as a consequence of these assumptions , in the absence of their interactions @xmath13 with spin @xmath30 , we may write the probabilities for @xmath31 neighbours @xmath32 of @xmath30 as independent , parametrized in the following way : @xmath33 then linking the @xmath34 spins to spin @xmath35 , we may write @xmath36 ) + \\beta \\left[\\sum_{\\nu \\in   v(0)_{\\setminus_\\mu } } [ h_{\\nu_1}^\\nu \\sigma_{\\nu_1}+h_{\\nu_2}^\\nu   \\sigma_{\\nu_2}]\\right]\\right\\}\\ ] ] it then follows that in this state the corresponding field @xmath37 associated to spin @xmath35 ( which again misses an interaction with one other pair of spins , interaction @xmath38 ) is given by @xmath39 + \\theta_0 \\label{cavfielditer}\\ ] ] on a sparse random graph with random interaction values , the macroscopic statistics will be governed by the distribution of cavity fields @xmath40 over the graph , which , due to the statistical independence of cavity spins , follows from iterating equation ( [ cavfielditer ] ) in distribution : @xmath41 \\nonumber",
    "\\\\   \\times \\left\\langle \\delta\\left\\{h-\\frac{1}{\\beta } \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1 }   \\tanh^{-1}[\\tanh(\\beta j)\\tanh(\\beta h_i ) \\tanh(\\beta g_i ) ] + \\theta\\right\\ } \\right\\rangle_{j,\\theta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the brackets denote averages over the interactions @xmath42 and random external fields @xmath43 . this equation may be solved numerically with a ` population dynamics ' algorithm @xcite . from the stationary distribution under this iteration algorithm ,",
    "all macroscopic quantities can be derived .",
    "belief propagation in essence is the above procedure applied to a specific instance of a ( sparse ) graph . now",
    "the procedure is focussed on the computation of local quantities , all the cavity fields associated to the graph , i.e. one for each link . by iterating equation ( [ cavfielditer ] ) for a given graph , one avoids averaging over the interaction values @xmath42 and the external fields @xmath43 .",
    "if the algorithm converges to a fixed point , from the resulting cavity fields one may compute the single node `` beliefs '' @xmath44 which are approximations for the marginal probabilities @xmath45 their expressions in terms of the cavity fields are @xmath46 where @xmath47 + \\theta_i\\ ] ] the 3-spin beliefs , approximations for the 3-spin marginals are computed from the cavity fields in a similar way .",
    "+ belief propagation has been rediscovered several times , and has a close relation with the bethe approximation .",
    "fixed points of belief propagation are minima of the bethe free energy , which is exact on tree - like graphs , but is often a good approximation when a graph contains loops @xcite .    for lower temperatures and for graphs with interactions inducing frustration effects , the cavity method and belief propagation break down .",
    "belief propagation often ceases to converge in these cases .",
    "one would expect a similar breakdown of the cavity method in this case , but since the order parameter of the cavity method is a macroscopic object , the behaviour is quite different generally .",
    "the distribution of cavity fields may still be stationary under the population dynamics iteration in parameter regimes where belief propagation does not converge .",
    "however , this stationary distribution obviously does not represent the distribution of locally consistent beliefs .",
    "thus the interpretation of this result is a more complicated issue in terms of local quantities .",
    "it is suggested @xcite that stability analysis through the iteration of perturbations in the distribution might reveal the location of the at line @xcite , at which the replica symmetric approximation becomes unstable . for the sk model @xcite on a dense graph this has been shown @xcite to be the case indeed .",
    "several heuristic @xcite or rigorous statements @xcite have been made concerning convergence of belief propagation in relation to the location in the phase diagram of ising spin type systems .",
    "the cavity method has been extended to deal with cases in which replica symmetry breaking occurs , and thus it is worthwile to modify this method and apply it to the case of single instance statistical inference . in the same manner , survey propagation and its generalization for nonzero energy density @xcite",
    "were developed for optimization problems .",
    "the main difference in the following discussion will be the application to problems at nonzero noise - level , i.e. at finite temperature .",
    "we will note here explicitly that this approach will not cure problems arising from short range correlations e.g. in regular lattices .",
    "a possible approach for this type of problems , which we shall not discuss here , is to take into account correlations between larger numbers of spins in the free energy .",
    "this idea was first introduced by kikuchi @xcite and leads to the cluster variation method @xcite      the cavity method at the level of one step replica symmetry breaking is usually applied at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that at @xmath48 on the one hand the equations simplify , and on the other hand there are more known applications in optimization problems for which a single instance generalization of this technique is fruitful ( e.g. 3-sat , graph colouring ) .",
    "here we will be applying the finite temperature version of the cavity method , of which we will just discuss the basic assumptions , and refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for a more thorough description .",
    "the main assumptions , to be compared with the assumptions of the cavity method in it s simple ( replica symmetric ) form , are summarized in the following :    in contrast with the ` single state ' cavity method , one now assumes that an exponential number of states contribute to the boltzmann measure . at each link of the graph , instead of regarding just one cavity field ,",
    "one takes into account a distribution of cavity fields .",
    "the density of states at a given free energy is of an exponential form : @xmath49 \\label{distfreeenergy}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the reference energy and @xmath0 is the so - called replica symmetry breaking parameter .",
    "this assumption is shown to be consistent with the iteration of cavity field distributions , given that the value of the cavity field in a given state is uncorrelated with the free energy of that particular state .",
    "a consequence is that at each iteration the distribution is reweighted by a factor @xmath51 $ ] , where @xmath52 is the difference between the free energies of the state before and after the iteration .",
    "observables will first be summed over all states @xmath53 weighted by their corresponding boltzmann factors @xmath54 , the result of which should be averaged over the distribution of free energies ( [ distfreeenergy ] ) .    in practice ,",
    "the calculation of observables is numerically implemented by an advanced population dynamics algorithm , in which @xmath4 populations of @xmath55 fields , each representing a distribution at a given link , are iterated .",
    "this procedure can be executed for all values of @xmath56 $ ] , yielding a generalized free energy @xmath57 . selecting the equilibrium state",
    "is achieved by demanding @xmath58 @xcite , which is equivalent to zooming in at the free energy of states for which the entropy of states ( or `` complexity '' ) becomes non - extensive @xcite .",
    "the numerical cost of the procedure described above is considerable , since the cavity field distributions are represented in terms of ( large ) sample populations .",
    "moreover , the extremization of the free energy with respect to @xmath0 may difficult , when the variation of @xmath57 as a function of @xmath0 is small . at zero temperature , for a large model class",
    ", the situation simplifies a lot , since the representation of cavity field distributions is much more efficient . in the case of discrete values for the local hamiltonian ( e.g. any spin glass with @xmath59 interactions , k - sat energy terms )",
    "the cavity fields can be assumed to take integer values , such that the only degrees of freedom are coefficients of a small number of delta peaks . for random @xmath60-satisfiability ,",
    "a single number parametrizes the field distribution for each link on the graph . in the sat phase , where the energy is zero",
    ", the reweighting of distributions by the free energy shift as described above effectively either leaves the distribution invariant , or rules out the state completely ( contradictory states ) , leading to the very efficient algorithm of survey propagation on single instances of random graphs representing the satisfiability problem .",
    "the goal of this paper in general is an investigation of the benefits of a survey propagation algorithm for finite temperature .",
    "the type of problem we address is the inference of marginal probabilities for a spin - glass type model displaying replica symmetry breaking effects . along the lines of the one step rsb cavity method for finite temperature we iterate distributions of cavity fields , where instead of sampling external fields and interaction values at each iteration , we let the distributions evolve on a given instance of a sparse graph , thus fixing the value of @xmath43 and @xmath42 locally . for a given value of the replica symmetry breaking parameter",
    ", the iteration equations are the following : @xmath61    e^{-m \\beta \\delta f(\\ { j_\\nu \\ } , \\ { h_{\\nu_1}^\\nu \\ } , \\ { g_{\\nu_2}^\\nu\\ } ) } \\nonumber \\\\ \\hspace*{-10 mm } \\times \\delta \\left\\ {   h_0^\\mu - \\sum_{\\nu \\in v(0)_{\\setminus_\\mu } } \\frac{1}{\\beta } \\tanh^{-1}[\\tanh(\\beta j_\\nu)\\tanh(\\beta h_{\\nu_1}^\\nu ) \\tanh(\\beta g_{\\nu_2}^\\nu ) ] - \\theta_0 \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62\\right \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath63\\ ] ] from the distributions of cavity fields , one may construct distributions of `` belief '' fields : @xmath64    e^{-m \\beta \\delta \\hat{f}(\\ { j_\\mu\\ } , \\ { h_{\\mu_1}^\\mu \\ } , \\ { g_{\\mu_2}^\\mu \\})}\\nonumber \\\\",

    "these are given in ( [ appfreee ] )",
    "the 3-spin model with finite connectivity may be regarded as an error correcting code of the sourlas - type @xcite .",
    "the sourlas code for p - spin interactions was originally studied for a fully connected model . in the limit @xmath69",
    "it is equivalent to the random energy model @xcite and the shannon limit is approached .",
    "the benefit of looking at finite connectivity codes and finite @xmath70 is the fact that the transmission rate , which vanishes for the dense graph and @xmath71 , is now finite @xcite .",
    "however , the drawback is the fact that the bit error rate does not vanish , such that for practical purposes its potential is limited . codes of the gallagher type ( low density parity check codes ) @xcite are more promising from that perspective , since they have vanishing bit error rate and approach the shannon limit .    the optimal decoding temperature for error correcting codes can be shown to coincide with the temperature corresponding to the `` channel noise '' @xcite .",
    "since this temperature is equal to the so - called `` nishimori temperature '' , it can be shown ( under certain conditions , including the absence of external fields or `` biases '' ) that this temperature always corresponds to a replica symmetric phase in the phase diagram @xcite , suggesting that belief propagation may be an appropriate decoding algorithm .    in real life , however , the channel noise might be an unknown quantity .",
    "if the estimate of the channel noise in this case is too small , the decoding is likely to happen in a parameter region where rsb effects play a role , in which bp either does not converge , or gives bad results .",
    "one would expect that in this case , the 1rsb generalisation might be a robust alternative @xcite    a more detailed inspection of the generic behaviour of error correcting codes tells us that decoding problems are caused by the so - called dynamical phase transition @xcite : in a low temperature regime above some critical channel noise value @xmath72 , the fragmentation of the free energy landscape prevents the algorithm from finding the ferromagnetic state . above an even larger noise value @xmath73 , the free energy of a replica symmetry broken spin glass state is lower than the ferromagnetic free energy , such that decoding is not possible at all .",
    "thus , the only region in which a 1rsb algorithm might improve the decoding performance , is in the region @xmath74 , thereby shifting the dynamical phase transition to a higher value .    in the presence of external fields , the model may be interpreted as a _ biased _ sourlas - code .",
    "the location in the phase diagram where improvement upon conventional decoding is to be expected , is close to the critical channel noise , for low decoding temperature . since in the case of a random bias",
    "we might not have a sharp phase transition , we will have to be careful in the selection of a suitable parameter regime .    in order to select a parameter regime in which our algorithm might perform better than bp , we will perform a short macroscopic analysis of the model .",
    "we will here shortly discuss the cavity analysis of the model for @xmath2-spin interactions and random external fields . in @xcite",
    "the model was studied for uniformly biased messages ( a uniform external field ) using the replica method . in principle",
    ", their result applies to the present case of random biases , due to gauge symmetry , for the appropriate choice of a message bias , but for clarity we will here discuss the derivation of this result to make the connection explicit .",
    "first of all , a locally biased message @xmath75 is generated , according to @xmath76}{2\\cosh[\\beta_p   \\theta_i]}\\ ] ] the external fields or biases will be generated from the distribution @xmath77 where we choose @xmath78 with @xmath43 constant and of course @xmath79 .",

    "this algorithm , though numerically expensive , seems particularly of interest for finite temperature decoding of error correcting codes at temperatures beneath the nishimori line close to the critical channel noise .",

    "furthermore , the dependence of the performance on various parameters , like the temperature , the bias , and the system size should be investigated further . in principle",
    ", the simple phase space structure of unbiased error correcting codes at the nishimori line suggests that in practice it should be easy to infer the value of the channel noise by varying the temperature in a bp algorithm alone , thereby circumventing the need for timeconsuming algorithms like the one proposed in this paper .",
    "the present analysis is therefore not intended as the basis for a practical algorithm , but rather as a proof of principle to show ( indirectly ) that a finite temperature 1 rsb method can accurately estimate marginal probabilities on problem instances where bp fails to converge .",
    "accordingly , the correspondence to results of a macroscopic analysis of the biased sourlas code within the 1rsb framework may be further specified , thereby more carefully specifying the regime in which finite temperature survey propagation would be an appropriate algorithm .",
