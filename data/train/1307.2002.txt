    "one of the major challenges for modern cosmology is understanding the nature of the cosmic acceleration .",
    "theories that modify general relativity in low - density and large - scale regimes are one possible appealing solution to the phenomenon , since they can reproduce the accelerated phase in only - matter universes .    the cosmic microwave background measurements ( cmb hereafter ) recently provided from the satellite experiment _",
    "planck  _  @xcite offer a new opportunity to investigate modified gravity scenarios .",
    "it is already well - known that modified gravity ( mg ) theories deeply influence the features of the cmb temperature anisotropies power spectrum ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . as a matter of fact , mg generally introduces modifications at large scales , through the late integrated sachs ",
    "wolfe effect  @xcite , and at small scales , through the weak lensing effect  @xcite .",
    "in this brief report we are interested in updating the constraints on mg we have found from the latest cmb measurements of the south pole telescope and the atacama cosmology telescope in  @xcite , in light of the new high resolution cmb data from _",
    "planck  _ .",
    "for this reason , as in the previous work , we focus on a particular class of mg models , the _",
    "f_(r ) theories ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , exploiting the parametrization proposed in  @xcite .",
    "this parametrization fixes the background expansion to the standard @xmath2cdm scenario and encodes the changes in the growth of perturbations in a single parameter @xmath0 that represents the length - scale of the theory  @xcite .",
    "other authors have already probed _",
    "f_(r ) theories trough this kind of parametrization using combinations of previous cmb measurements , supernovae luminosity distances , galaxy cluster distribution and cluster abundance measurements  @xcite .",
    "adding the cluster abundance to other data sets actually provides a very tight limit on @xmath0 ( @xmath3% c.l .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the high resolution cmb measurements from _",
    "planck  _ provide strong constraints on _ f_(r ) even without combination with other experiments .",
    "moreover we are interested in evaluating if mg alleviates some tensions between the parameter values measured by _",
    "planck  _ and other experiments .",
    "the report is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theories ] we briefly resume the modified gravity model considered in the analysis , in section  [ sec : analysis ] we describe the method of analysis and present the results , in section  [ sec : concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "in the following analysis we adopt the generic mg parametrization from  @xcite where the deviations from the general relativity equations are introduced through two parametric functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 = \\mu(k , a )   12 \\pi g a^2    ( \\rho + p ) \\sigma \\label{mg - anisotropy}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the scalar metric potentials in the newtonian gauge , @xmath10 is the anisotropic stress , @xmath11 is the density contrast and @xmath12 is the comoving density perturbation . in",
    "@xcite it has been proved that we can effectively reproduce the perturbations of _ _",
    "f__@xmath13 theories choosing the following parametric form for @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath14 where the parameter @xmath15 must be @xmath16 in order to closely mimic the @xmath2cdm expansion  @xcite .",
    "therefore , our parametrization has only one degree of freedom that is encoded by the length - scale of the theory @xmath17 . for scales larger than @xmath17 the dynamic recovers the standard general relativity , otherwise differences in the potentials @xmath9 and @xmath8 are allowed and a different growth pattern for the structures can arise .    in accordance to the previous literature",
    ", we present the constraints on the length - scale in units of the horizon scale , expressing them in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath0 @xmath18",
    "we obtain the theoretical cmb power spectrum with the publicly available code mgcamb  @xcite and perform a markov chain monte carlo analysis with a modified version of the cosmomc package  @xcite .    concerning the cmb data set , we consider the _",
    "planck  _ measurements , that probes the cmb temperature angular power spectrum up to the multipole @xmath19 , combined with the cmb polarization measurements performed by the _ wmap  _ experiment  @xcite up to the multipole @xmath20 .",
    "we refer to this combination as planck data set .",
    "we also consider the effect of imposing a gaussian prior on the hubble parameter @xmath21 based on the latest hubble space telescope result  @xcite .",
    "we refer to this prior as hst .",
    "moreover we take in account a combination of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) measurements at different redshifts from four surveys : the 6df galaxy survey measurement at z = 0.1 provided in  @xcite , the first sdss dr7 measurements at @xmath22 and @xmath23 from  @xcite , the reanalyzed sdss dr7 measurement at @xmath23 from  @xcite , the wigglez measurements at @xmath24 extracted in  @xcite , the boss dr9 measurement at @xmath25 discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we refer to this combination as the bao data set .",
    "the cosmological parameters we sample in the markov chains are : the mg parameter @xmath0 , the baryon and cold dark matter densities @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling @xmath28 , the optical depth at the reionization @xmath29 , the scalar spectral index @xmath30 , the amplitude of the primordial scalar perturbation spectrum @xmath31 at @xmath32 .",
    "we also investigate the effect of adding to the former set of parameters the lensing amplitude parameter @xmath33 that simply rescales the lensing power spectrum @xmath34  @xmath35 as defined in @xcite .",
    "we fix the helium abundance to @xmath36 , the number of relativistic degrees of freedom to @xmath37 , the total neutrino mass to @xmath38 .    in the first part of the analysis we fix the lensing amplitude to @xmath39 and we investigate the results from the planck data set only , planck plus hst prior , planck plus bao measurements .",
    "the results we obtain are shown in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ]    with planck alone we find a constraint on the mg parameter ( @xmath40 at 95% c.l . )",
    "similar to the constraint obtained in  @xcite from the combination of _ wmap  _ 9 and south pole telescope measurements . as we expect",
    ", the combination planck plus bao data sets provides a tighter constraint ( @xmath41 at 95% c.l . ) . as a matter of fact bao measurements better constrain the growth of structures at low redshift .",
    "the latter combination also improves the tightest constraint found in @xcite by a factor @xmath42 . instead , when we consider also the hst prior we get a weaker constraint ( @xmath43 at 95% c.l .",
    "this fact is due to the bimodal behavior of the posterior distribution of @xmath0 ( see the left panel of fig .  [ fig.b0 ] ) .",

    "the effect of varying the lensing amplitude is the developing or the increasing of the bimodal behavior for the posterior distribution.,title=\"fig:\",width=4 ]    an interesting feature of _",

    "the tension between direct and indirect measurements of @xmath1 is clearly alleviated in the mg scenario.,title=\"fig:\",width=158 ]    in the second part of the analysis we consider the effects of varying the lensing amplitude @xmath33 .",
    "the results are presented in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] .",
    "when the parameter @xmath33 is let free to vary the bimodal behavior of the @xmath0 posterior distribution appears also for the planck only and the planck+bao data set combinations .",
    "moreover in the hst case the effect is even increased ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.b0 ] ) . for this reason",
    "the constraints on @xmath0 are weaker respect to the case where @xmath33 is fixed ( see tab .  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the bimodal behavior is due to the fact that the _",
    "f_(r ) model we consider acts on the cmb power spectrum in two ways . at high multipoles",
    "it imitates the effect of @xmath33 greater than one , favouring lower @xmath33 values compared to the @xmath2cdm case . at low multipoles instead it lowers the integrated sachs - wolfe effect plateau , contrary to the effect of an increased @xmath1 value , favoring the match between theory and data even in presence of large @xmath1 values .",
    "the tension between these effects creates the local maximum in the posterior distribution .",
    "remarkably in mg models the lensing amplitude return to be compatible with @xmath39 at 68% c.l .",
    "if we consider planck or planck combined with hst and even at 95% c.l . if we consider planck combined with bao . while in the @xmath2cdm scenario the standard value @xmath39",
    "is compatible with planck and planck combined with bao only at 95% c.l . and",
    "is excluded at 95% c.l when in the combination planck plus hst prior  @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     .",
    "in this brief report we provide updated constraints on the length - scale parameter @xmath0 of _ _ f__@xmath13 theories , using the data recently released by the _ planck  _ experiment together with the @xmath1 measurement from hst and bao data sets from four different surveys .",
    "we also investigate the effects of varying the lensing amplitude @xmath33 from its standard value .",
    "our analysis provides the tightest constraint on @xmath0 from cmb measurements only and from one single experiment in general ( @xmath46 95% c.l . ) .",
    "it also improves by a factor @xmath42 the previous tighter constraint from the cmb measurements plus bao data sets we reported in @xcite .",
    "when we consider @xmath39 , the constraint we obtain from planck plus bao is @xmath41 at 95% c.l .",
    "moreover we found a bimodal behavior for the @xmath0 posterior distribution when the hst prior is present or when @xmath33 is free to vary , making the constraints weaker in these cases .",
    "furthermore we found that in the framework of the considered mg models the standard value of the lensing amplitude @xmath39 returns to be in agreement with the _ planck  _ measurements , oppositely to what happens in the @xmath2cdm scenario .",
