    "the idea that our universe may be a hypermembrane in a five dimensional spacetime has received some attention in the last few years after it was realized that gravity could be localized on a three - brane embedded in an anti - de  sitter spacetime  @xcite . since then",
    ", much work has been done in a cosmological context  @xcite and there is hope that a consistent ( i.e. , mathematically self - contained and observationally satisfying ) high dimensional model might soon be formulated .",
    "for instance , it has been proposed that a model  @xcite based on such ideas could present itself as an alternative to the inflationary paradigm , although for the time being the controversy as to whether or not such a model might have anything in common with our universe is still going on  @xcite .",
    "the idea is not new however , but has evolved from the standard kaluza - klein approach to that of particle localization on a higher dimensional defect  @xcite . in particular , it has been shown that massless bulk scalars and gravitons share the property to have a zero mode localized on the brane  @xcite in the randall - sundrum model .",
    "various mechanisms  @xcite have been invoked according to which it would be possible to confine massless gauge bosons on a brane , so that there is hope to achieve a reasonable model including all the known interactions in a purely four dimensional effective model .",
    "a mechanism permitting localization of massless fermions on a domain wall was described in refs .",
    "however , although appealing this mechanism might be , it should be emphasized that actual fermions , as seen on an everyday basis in whatever particle physics experiment , are massive , so that a realistic fermionic matter model on the brane must accommodate for such a mass .",
    "the question of localization of massive fermions on the brane thus arises naturally , and it is the purpose of this work to provide the transverse brane and fermionic structure that leads to this localization . up to now , fermions have been confined under the restricting hypothesis that the brane self gravity was negligible  @xcite , or that it was embedded in a minkowski spacetime with one  @xcite or two  @xcite transverse dimensions ( see also  @xcite for the localization of fermion on a string - like defect in five dimension ) .    our goal is to transpose the original work of ref .",
    "@xcite to the brane context . for that purpose",
    ", we realize the brane as a domain wall . such domain wall configurations in anti - de  sitter space",
    "have already been studied  @xcite .",
    "we will assume that five dimensional fermions are yukawa - coupled to the domain wall forming higgs field , as in the usual case of cosmic strings .",
    "in this respect , our work somehow extends ref .",
    "@xcite , where the mass term was put by hand , and ref .",
    "@xcite where the gravity of the wall was neglected .",
    "we start , in the following section , by recalling the domain wall configuration of a higgs field in a five dimensional anti - de  sitter spacetime and discuss briefly its properties . in section  [ sec_dirac ] , we describe the dynamical equations of fermions coupled to this domain wall in order to show that they obey a schrdinger - like equation with an effective potential which can trap massive modes on the wall .",
    "the asymptotic structure , i.e. , deep in the bulk ( far from the brane ) , is not minkowski space , so that the effective potential felt by the fermions possesses a local minimum at the brane location , but no global minimum , as first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the bound states are metastable and fermions can tunnel to the bulk .",
    "we then provide an analytical approximation of the effective potential , thanks to which we compute analytically , in section  [ sec_analy ] , the mass spectrum of the fermions trapped on the brane .",
    "we obtain the mass of the heaviest fermion that can live on the brane and estimate its tunneling rate .",
    "this result is compared to a full numerical integration , performed in section  [ sec_num ] . in a last section ,",
    "we investigate the parameter space and , after having compared our results to previous ones , we conclude that there exists a wide region in the parameter space for which the fermion masses can be made arbitrary low , i.e. , comparable to the observed small values ( with respect to the brane characteristic energy scale ) , while their confinement life - time can be made much larger than the age of the universe .",
    "such models can therefore be made viable as describing realistic matter on the brane .",

    "this system of equations must be supplemented with boundary conditions . by definition of the topological defect like configuration , we require that the higgs field vanishes on the membrane itself , i.e. , @xmath32 for @xmath33 , while it recovers its vev in the bulk , so that @xmath34 .",
