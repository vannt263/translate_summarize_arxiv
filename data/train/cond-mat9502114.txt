    "phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry breakings abound in modern condensed matter physics . of particular interest are the low energy excitations associated with _ continuous _",
    "broken symmetries , like the broken translational and orientational invariance of a crystal , the broken rotational symmetry of ferromagnet or the broken gauge symmetry of superfluids and superconductors . by imposing a slow spatial variation of the continuous symmetry operation on the ground state ,",
    "one generates an important class of modes which can be easily excited near @xmath2 . in ferromagnets for example , these goldstone modes are called spin waves , or , in quantized form , `` magnons . '' in crystalline solids , the translational broken symmetryl leads to new shear phonon modes . unlike a nematic liquid crystal ,",
    "the additional broken rotational symmetry of a solid does _ not _ lead to any extra low energy modes : rotational modes are coupled to phonons in a way reminiscent of the higgs mechanism and are thus rendered massive ",
    "@xcite below and references therein . in superfluid helium ,",
    "the broken symmetry selects a particular phase for the condensate order parameter , and leads to second sound .",
    "the physics of superconductors is complicated by the _ charge _ of the cooper pairs and by the coupling of electron motion to the underlying ionic lattice .",
    "low energy phase - degrees of freedom are still important , although now it is the vector potential which acquires a mass via the usual higgs mechanism .",
    "the excitations discussed above are all continuously connected to the ground state .",
    "however , point , line and wall defects in the order parameter texture , which are _ not _ continuously connected to the ground state , may also be important .",
    "dislocation lines mediate plastic flow , and point - like vacancies and interstitials allow rapid particle diffusion in crystalline solids .",
    "vortex rings control the decay of supercurrents in superfluids and superconductors .",
    "most laboratory ferromagnets are subject to weak crystal fields , which break rotational invariance . in this case , the width of hysterisis loops below the curie temperature is controlled by the motion of bloch walls . under some circumstances",
    ", such topological defects also play an important role in the phase transition out of the broken symmetry state .    in this review",
    ", we discuss the defects which arise in superfluids , superconductors and membranes .",
    "although the emphasis is how to incorporate defects into simple landau - ginzburg field theories , we also touch upon their role in the statistical mechanics .",
    "we concentrate on two - dimensional systems , so that the defects are typically point - like .",
    "the classic example of vortices and the kosterlitz - thouless transition in superfluid helium films is discussed first , together with universal jump in the superfluid density .",
    "experimental confirmation of this prediction was an important test of the idea of defect - mediated phase transitions .",
    "_ screening _ of defect energies in superconducting films is then treated , with particular attention to the spreading of magnetic field lines in the three - dimensional volume outside the sample .",
    "when this spreading is ignored , screening efficiently cuts off the logarithmic divergence in the vortex energy .",
    "the finite energy vortices in this `` naive '' theory then proliferate for entropic reasons at any finite temperature , thus destroying superconductivity .",
    "in realistic samples , however , magnetic field line spreading ( which arises because supercurrents are confined to a two - dimensional plane ) renders screening less efficient , and a kosterlitz - thouless transition from a finite temperature superconducting state becomes possible .",
    "the remainder of the paper contrasts the behavior of defects in membranes and monolayers . by `` monolayers , '' we mean crystalline films strongly confined to a plane . dislocations and disclinations control the statistical mechanics of monolayers in a way similar to vortices in neutral superfluids . successive dislocation and disclination unbinding transitions lead from crystalline to hexatic to liquid monolayer phases .",
    "in contrast to monolayers , `` membranes '' have a relatively low energy cost to buckle out of the two - dimensional plane , thus escaping into the third dimension . as a result",
    ", defects can be screened by out - of - plane displacements much like vortices in the `` naive '' model of superconducting films .",
    "dislocations , for example , now have a finite energy .",
    "their entropic proliferation causes crystals to be replaced by _",
    "hexatics _ as the inevitable low temperature phase of membranes .",
    "we also discuss the buckling of 5- and 7-fold disclinations , of vacancies , interstitial and impurity atoms , and of grain boundaries .",
    "we conclude by emphasizing the fundamental asymmetry between 5- and 7-fold disclinations in membranes .",
    "there is an exact symmetry between plus and minus vortices in superfluids and between dislocations with equal and opposite burgers vectors in two - dimensional crystals , which forces the energies of the defect and anti - defects to be equal .",
    "no such symmetry , however , insures that the core energies of plus and minus disclinations are identical .",
    "these disclinations represent points of local 5- and 7-fold coordination , where the number of neighboring particles is determined by the dirichlet construction .",
    "this situation is similar to vacancies and interstitials in crystalline solids : vacancies typically have a lower energy than interstitials , even though these excitations are `` anti - defects '' of each other .",
    "disclination asymmetry is of little consequence in flat monolayers , where the concentrations of 5- and 7-fold defects must be equal for topological reasons .",
    "( more precisely , euler s theorem ensures that the average coordination is six in a sufficiently large system . ) in hexatic monolayers , moreover , the logarithmic divergences in the energies of isolated plus and minus disclinations have equal coefficients .",
    "the situation is different , however , in _ membranes _ which are free to change their topology or with free boundary conditions which allow them to curl up near the edges .",
    "when the bending rigidity which controls out - of - plane fluctuations is small , buckling in hexatic membranes leads to different coefficients in the logarithmically diverging disclination energies . in liquid membranes ,",
    "moreover , different core energies of plus and minus disclinations will inevitably bias the system towards a net positive or negative average gaussian curvature .",
    "the energy asymmetry between 5- and 7-fold disclinations in the liquid determines the sign of the gaussian rigidity , which acts as chemical potential controlling their population difference .",
    "returning to the comparison with a superconductor , the gaussian rigidity acts like an external magnetic field , which would bias superconducting films toward a net excess of plus or minus vortices . in membranes , the sign of the gaussian bending rigidity determines whether vesicle phases ( with positive net gaussian curvature ) or `` plumbers nightmare '' phases ( with overall negative gaussian curvature ) are preferred .",
    "theories and simulations of hexatic and liquid membranes usually avoid this issue by imposing a definite spherical or torroidal topology , which automatically fixes the difference in the number of 5- and 7-fold defects .",
    "such constraints are clearly artificial , however , for lipid bilayer membranes which can change their topology at will , and may even have free edges at some intermediate stage of a topological change . the analogous constraint for vacancies and interstitials in solids would be imposed by periodic boundary conditions : these defects can then only be created in pairs . in real solids , with free boundary conditions , vacancies and interstitials can enter at the surface to produce the concentrations dictated by the microscopic energetics .",
    "the simplest probe of disclination bias would be to simulate liquid membranes with free edges , and see which defect begins to dominate as the bending rigidity is reduced from large values .",
    "see section  iii.d for details .",
    "a detailed and successful theory of two - dimensional superfluidity was constructed in the 1970s .",
    "the theory explains the observed properties of thin films of superfluid he@xmath0 on various substrates and the physics of thin superconducting films .",
    "the basic physical idea of defect unbinding was proposed by kosterlitz and thouless @xcite , by berezinski @xcite , and , in a different physical context , by degennes @xcite .",
    "the first detailed calculations were carried out by kosterlitz @xcite , who exploited a pioneering renormalization group method developed by anderson and yuval for the kondo problem @xcite . because extensive reviews are available elsewhere @xcite , we limit ourselves to a brief sketch of the models and the basic results .",

    "superfluidity arises with decreasing temperature in helium films in a fundamentally different way than in bulk materials .",
    "two basic experiments which reveal this difference are illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "on an oscillating substrate , a finite fraction of the he@xmath0 film decouples from the underlying motion below a critical temperature @xmath3 . the film appears lighter than it should be , and measuring this deficit allows one to extract the temperature - dependent superfluid density @xmath4 @xcite . in a related experiment , third - sound excitations similar to capillary waves",
    "propagate below @xmath3 with negligible damping through films as thin as a fraction of an angstrom @xcite",
    ". such propagating waves would be impossible in a classical fluid , due to viscous damping .",

    "the phase transition is nevertheless _ not _ first order , as becomes evident from an examination of the specific heat ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "there is only a rounded maximum _ above _ the transition temperature , in contrast to the delta function peak expected for a true first - order transition .",
