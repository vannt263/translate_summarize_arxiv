    "roughly 100 gaseous giant planets are currently known to orbit nearby sun - like stars .",
    "many of those planets are located at very small orbital distances from their parent stars , where tidal forces are thought to maintain a rotation rate synchronous with the orbit  thus producing permanent day and night sides on the planet .",
    "this situation presents a new rgime of atmospheric circulation , not encountered in our solar system : slowly - rotating giant planets , which are continuously exposed to intense stellar heating on the same side . measuring the resulting temperature structure on these planets is a major goal of current and future observational programs . in this _ letter _ , we report on high - resolution , fully - turbulent global simulations of the atmospheric flow on hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b , presently the only close - in extrasolar giant planet ( cegp ) with a measured mass ( @xmath2 ) and radius ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the parent star of hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b  shows discernible brightness decrements every 3.5  days , due to occultations by the planet as it transits across the star .",
    "this property has recently led to precise measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( charbonneau et al .",
    "2000 ; henry et al .",
    "2000 ; mazeh et al .",
    "2000 ) , confirming its giant nature .",
    "it has also allowed the detection of sodium absorption , providing the first probe of the planet s atmosphere ( charbonneau et al .",
    "according to the standard planetary formation picture , hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b  is expected to have formed at a large distance ( @xmath4  1  au ) from its parent star ( see , e.g. , boss 1996 ) and migrated inward ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; lin et al .",
    "1996 ; murray et al .",
    "1998 ) , quickly ( @xmath5  10 myr ) reaching its present distance of only 0.046  au from the star ( see e.g. , burrows et al .",
    "there , it was forced by tidal effects to permanently present the same face to its star ( see , e.g. , goldreich & soter 1966)as the moon does to the earth . from this synchronization ,",
    "the rotation period of the cegp is known ( same as its orbital period of 3.5 days ) . however , unlike our moon with its insignificant atmosphere , hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b  is expected to possess vigorous meteorology and associated horizontal transport of heat and chemical species , due to the presence of a thin , stable ( radiative ) atmospheric region above the convective interior ( guillot et al .",
    "1996 ; seager & sasselov 1998 ) .",
    "we model the stable region of hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b s atmosphere as a shallow layer of hydrostatically balanced , frictionless gas  moving under the influence of gravitational and coriolis accelerations .",
    "the motion of such a layer enveloping a planet is governed by the equivalent barotropic formulation of the shallow - water equations on a rotating sphere ( salby 1989 ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the horizontal velocity with @xmath8 and @xmath9 the longitude and latitude , respectively ; @xmath10 is the thickness of the modeled layer , proportional to the temperature ; @xmath11 is the coriolis parameter , where @xmath12 is the rotation rate of the planet ; @xmath13 is the local unit vector normal to the planetary surface ; @xmath14 is the gravitational acceleration ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , the adiabatic and diabatic thermal forcing , representing uneven hemispheric heating and cooling due to synchronization ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are characteristic @xmath19-folding times ; @xmath20 is the equilibrium thickness ; @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are constants ; and , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the specific gas constant and @xmath25 is the specific heat at constant pressure .    the nonlinear equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) describe circulations in which the motion field is vertically aligned over one or more pressure scale heights , @xmath26 .",
    "they are column - integrated representation of the equations used in general circulation models and are solved numerically using the highly - accurate pseudospectral algorithm ( eliasen , mechenhauer & rasmussen 1970 ; orszag 1970 ) .",
    "approximately 150 simulation runs with up to t341 ( 1024@xmath27512 grid ) resolution have been performed to explore the full physical and numerical parameter - space available for the hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b  atmosphere .",
    "the details of the full exploration are described elsewhere ( cho et al .",
    "2003 ) . here",
    ", we emphasize only the main robust features from the large number of simulations ",
    "namely , the emergence of long timescale variability due to moving polar vortices and `` thermal '' spots of high contrast from the background temperature field .",
    "high - resolution , shallow - layer barotropic models in spherical geometry have been successfully used to model the atmospheric dynamics of the solar system gaseous giant planets ( williams 1978 ; cho & polvani 1996a ) , as well as stratospheric ( stable region ) phenomena on the earth ( see , e.g. , juckes & mcintyre 1987 ) . an alternate model of observed cloud level circulation on jupiter as a surface expression of deep convective columns , oriented parallel to the planetary rotation axis , also exists ( sun et al . 1993 ; schubert & zhang 2000 ) .",
    "however , only the shallow - layer model has thus far qualitatively reproduced the essential features ( bands , zonal winds , persistent spots , and anticyclonic dominance ) on all of the giant planets in our solar system using only the observed values of physical parameters ( cho & polvani 1996a ) .    for hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b",
    ", we adopt parameter values where known ( charbonneau et al .",
    "2000 ; henry et al .",
    "2000 ; mazeh et al .",
    "2000 ) : @xmath28 , @xmath29  m  s@xmath30 , @xmath31  m , @xmath32  s@xmath33 , and @xmath34  m. the last (=  @xmath35 ) represents the global mean layer thickness , whose value corresponds to the equivalent blackbody temperature ( @xmath36  @xmath37  k for a bond albedo , @xmath38 ; the results presented here , however , are insensitive to the precise choice of @xmath36  and @xmath39 ) . the values for two required parameters@xmath21 , the amplitude of hemispheric thermal forcing , and @xmath40 , the characteristic wind speed related to the global mean kinetic energy ",
    "are not known and hence varied . from run",
    "to run , @xmath21 is varied from 0 to @xmath41 , corresponding respectively to no heating and maximum substellar - point heating in the absence of atmospheric motion ; @xmath40 is varied from 50  m  s@xmath33 to 1000  m  s@xmath33 , roughly the observed value for jupiter ( ingersoll 1990 ) and the value expected from a simple thermal wind balance ( showman & guillot 2002 ) , respectively .",
    "note that the latter value leads to a nonlinearly - balanced wind field which can locally approach the sound speed ( @xmath12700  m s@xmath33 ) ; on all observed atmospheres in our solar system , @xmath40 does not exceed @xmath1400  m  s@xmath33 ( beatty & chaiken 1990 ) .",
    "we have carefully studied the effects of @xmath40 on the variability and thermal contrast and find that , while a variability in the flow is a generic feature for hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b , a significant thermal contrast generally requires a small @xmath21 or a large @xmath40 . in the following ,",
    "we give an example of the expected generic flow pattern and then describe a typical flow - induced thermal variability which may be observationally relevant .",
    "fig .  1 shows an instantaneous atmospheric flow field on hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b  at dynamic equilibrium from one of our simulations with @xmath42  m  s@xmath33 and @xmath21 corresponding to a maximum day / night temperature difference of 180  k. the flow exhibits considerable complexity and variability : it is characterized by a broad equatorial band containing thin , undulating filamentary structures at low and middle latitudes and displaced , translating circumpolar vortices at the rotation poles .",
    "the large undulations at low latitudes , which can roll up into small vortices , are due to high - amplitude rossby ( planetary ) waves .",
    "in addition to being responsible for weather , the planetary waves efficiently stir and mix tracers ( e.g. , clouds , chemical species , potential vorticity ) when they break , homogenizing the region in which the breakings occur ( juckes & mcintyre 1987 ) . in contrast ,",
    "polar vortices sequester air inside , their sharp boundaries serving as robust barriers to material transport between their interiors and the well - mixed interstitial regions .",
    "the overall flow is similar to that of earth s winter stratosphere .",
    "the complex flow of fig .  1 corresponds to a global circulation pattern of 3 zonal jets , shown in fig .  2 .",
    "jets are atmospheric flow structures , which are obtained by longitudinally averaging the eastward wind at each latitude .",
    "the pattern in fig .",
    "2 naturally evolves from an initially random flow without jets , with the basic profile forming approximately at day 20 .",
    "the emergence of jets from a random field is a generic feature of turbulent flows in a differentially rotating shallow layer ( rhines 1975 ; williams 1978 ; cho & polvani 1996b ) . for the extreme values of @xmath40 considered with all other parameters",
    "held fixed , 2 or 4 jets are also possible . however ,",
    "once formed , the jets do not change qualitatively  even under applied thermal forcing  for up to several hundred hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b  days , the duration of the simulation .",
    "the presence of a low number of broad jets , along with polar vortices , leads to a circulation pattern which is markedly different from that of cloud - top jupiter .",
    "although cegps are sometimes dubbed `` hot jupiters '' , the circulation pattern is more like that of uranus or neptune , or even earth , than that of jupiter or saturn , which have @xmath110 narrow jets ( ingersoll 1990 ) .",
    "dynamically , this is expected given roughly the factors of ten greater @xmath36  and ten slower rotation rate of hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b  compared to jupiter .",
    "the combined effect , giving the flows in figs .  1 and  2 , is characterized by the rossby deformation scale , @xmath43@xmath44 , which is to be compared with @xmath3 .",
    "generally , @xmath43/@xmath45 is required for a jupiter - like multiple - jet circulation pattern without pronounced polar vortices at the cloud - top . for hd  @xmath0209458",
    "@xmath0b , @xmath43/@xmath46 .",
    "jets and vortices / eddies can strongly influence the overall thermal structure by transporting heat .",
    "since the state of the hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b s cloud - top is not likely to be at rest and driven solely by stellar heating , we delay the application of thermal forcing ( in contrast to showman & guillot 2002 ) until the flow field self - organizes into the pattern in fig .  2 .",
    "dynamically , this is a likely flow state of hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b  in the presence of weak or uniform heating ( i.e. , at _ pre_-synchronization ) .",
    "the forcing is slowly increased to the specified value of @xmath21 over a characteristic radiative equilibrium time , @xmath47  days , appropriate for @xmath11  bar pressure level on hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b . at this depth , @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the characteristic circulation time ) , signifying a large distance advection of airmass before it warms or cools appreciably .",
    "the results presented here do not change qualitatively with the value of @xmath50 ( @xmath1 0100 days ) , using either an adiabatic ( @xmath51 ) or a diabatic ( @xmath52 ) representation of thermal forcing .    at each point on the planet",
    ", the layer thickness is related to the temperature field , @xmath53 , via the hypsometric relation ( holton 1992 ; salby 1989 ) . in our simulations with small @xmath21 or large @xmath40 ,",
    "the @xmath54 field exhibits a generic feature which is in direct contrast to the simple permanent day / night picture .",
    "3 shows the @xmath54 distribution ( from the same run of figs .  1 and 2 ) at several different times .",
    "note that the warmest and the coldest regions are not located at the sub - stellar and the anti - stellar `` thermal poles '' ( at the equator ) , respectively .",
    "instead , the temperature extrema are located near the rotation poles , inside a coherent hot / cold spot pair at each pole . nor are the extrema stationary : they revolve around the poles with a period of @xmath125 days in this case .",
    "the movement leads to a distribution that for a time has the temperature minimum actually on the `` hot '' day side and the maximum on the `` cold '' night side .",
    "in addition , the temperature difference between the two extrema is large and strongly asymmetric ; here , the difference is @xmath1300  k , with the diffuse hot region @xmath170  k above and the sharp cold region @xmath1230  k below @xmath36 . for the case with @xmath55",
    "m  s@xmath33 , the difference reaches @xmath11000  k , with a temperature minimum of @xmath1800  k below @xmath36  at the core of the cold spots .",
    "the presence of high - contrast hot and cold spots on hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b  induces spatio - temporal variability , which may produce detectable fluctuations in observational signatures .",
    "sensitive enough infrared flux measurements ( e.g. , such as those possible with sirtf ) could reveal variability in time during an orbit of the planet as different faces are seen from earth , as well as from orbit to orbit as the spots ( polar vortices ) revolve about the rotation poles .",
    "the lack of detectable variability would thus point toward either an obscuring uniform haze overlying the modeled region or an inefficient conversion of stellar irradiation to atmospheric kinetic energy . in the latter case ,",
    "the formed spots are weak ( i.e. , small temperature / thickness perturbation ) and thermal forcing which produces bulging in the modeled layer of more than several percent overwhelms any temperature variability due to atmospheric motion .",
    "the equilibrium day / night temperature is then robustly maintained .",
    "the extreme conditions inside the spots in our calculations suggest several additional potential observables since absorption levels , albedo , intrinsic thermal emission , and presence , type , or height of clouds could all be different within the different spots",
    ". the spatially integrated spectrum , therefore , can be different from the uniform planet case .",
    "for example , enhanced levels of ch@xmath56/co abundance inside the cold spots are possible , given the value of @xmath36  used ( seager et al . 2000 ) .",
    "similarly , condensates , such as mgsio@xmath57 ( enstatite ) , may also be found inside the diffuse hot spots , where temperatures may be high enough ( sudarsky et al . 2000 ; seager et al . 2000 ) . if the temperature at radiative equilibrium is actually higher than assumed ( e.g. , @xmath12000  k ) , the opposite situation may occur ",
    "mgsio@xmath57 may be found in the cold spots .",
    "in addition , by sequestering chemically active species and periodically exposing them to the stellar irradiation ( as the spots revolve around the poles ) , the spots could also affect atomic number densities and could be part of the explanation for the recently observed low abundance of na  i on hd  @xmath0209458  @xmath0b  ( charbonneau et al . 2002 ) .",
