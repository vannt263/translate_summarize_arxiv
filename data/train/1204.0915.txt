    "@xcite showed that the phase transition is not visible under usual simulation methods used in practice for such interest rates models , such as finite difference or monte carlo methods .",

    "@xcite that the presence of such a transition is generic for all interest rate models with log - normally distributed rates in the terminal measure .",

    "this is in contrast to the method of the recursion relations used in @xcite to solve the @xmath11 limit of the model with uniform volatility , which does not appear to be easily extended beyond this case due to the unmanageable complexity of the resulting expressions .",
    "the equivalence of the interest rates models considered with interacting lattice gases shows that the former have a rich dynamics which has not been fully explored .",
    "physical intuition about the lattice gas equivalent should give further insight into the dynamics of the interest rate models .",
    "in particular , one natural question is whether a phase transition similar to that studied in ref .",
    "@xcite is present also in the lattice gas considered here , and if it is observed also for a finite size lattice .",
    "the analog of the van der waals limit for this case corresponds to simultaneously scaling the volatility as @xmath159 as the mean reversion is taken to zero @xmath66 .",
    "it would be interesting to see if the behaviour of the system in this limit has implications also for the practically relevant case of non - zero volatility .",

    "<S> we consider the class of short rate interest rate models for which the short rate is proportional to the exponential of a gaussian markov process @xmath0 in the terminal measure @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these models include the black , derman , toy and black , karasinski models in the terminal measure . </S>",
    "<S> we show that such interest rate models are equivalent with lattice gases with attractive two - body interaction @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider in some detail the black , karasinski model with @xmath0 an ornstein , uhlenbeck process , and show that it is similar with a lattice gas model considered by kac and helfand , with attractive long - range two - body interactions @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit solution for the model is given as a sum over the states of the lattice gas , which is used to show that the model has a phase transition similar to that found previously in the black , derman , toy model in the terminal measure . </S>"
