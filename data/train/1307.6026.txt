    "the x - ray pulsar her x-1 is an accreting neutron star ( ns ) with a spin period of @xmath0  s in a 1.7-day orbit around 1.8 - 2 @xmath1 star @xcite . since its discovery in 1972 by the _ uhuru _",
    "satellite , the detailed nature of the source has been a subject of intensive studies , primarily because of its very complex time behavior .",
    "the long - term x - ray light curve of her x-1 is modulated with a @xmath2-day period .",
    "the cycle includes the main - on state with an average duration of @xmath3 days and the secondary ( short - on ) state of smaller intensity which lasts @xmath4  days .",
    "most 35-d cycles last for about 20 , 20.5 , or 21 orbital cycles ; see @xcite .",
    "these two on - states are separated by time intervals with a duration of about four orbital periods during which the x - ray flux almost vanishes .",
    "these changes , as well as spectral measurements from the rxte satellite @xcite , clearly indicate the eclipse of the x - ray source by a precessing accretion disk .    the 35-day cycle in her x-1 is generally interpreted to be a manifestation of the precession motion of the accretion disk around the ns in the retrograde orbital direction .",
    "soon after the discovery of this x - ray pulsar it was proposed that free precession of the ns can also be responsible for the observed long - term modulation of the x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite had interpreted the evolution of the x - ray pulse profile shape with the phase of the 35-day cycle as observed by exosat as due to the free precession of the ns in her x-1 .",
    "one of the observed properties of the 35-d cycle in her x-1 is its turn - ons occurring predominantly around orbital phases @xmath5 or 0.7 ( see , however , the recent debate in @xcite based on the analysis of the rxte asm data ) .",
    "this feature can be explained by tidal nutation motion of outer parts of the accretion disk at about double orbital frequency , as at these orbital phases the disk inclination angle to the line of sight changes most rapidly ( see also @xcite ) .    immediately after the beginning of active studies of her x-1 it became clear that the tilted accretion disk in this binary system must have a twisted form . during the retrograde precession ,",
    "the outer parts of such a disk open the view to the central x - ray source ( the turn - on of the source ) , and the inner parts of the disk cover it at the end of the main - on @xcite .",
    "the ingress and egress to and from the two 35-day low states are asymmetric due to scattering of x - ray emission by the hot rarefied corona above the disk .",
    "indeed , the opening of the x - ray source at the beginning of the main - on is observed to be accompanied by significant changes in the soft x - ray band suggesting strong absorption @xcite .",
    "the change of x - ray pulse profiles with the 35-d phase is a well - established property of her x-1 and has been observed by various satellites ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we show that the changes in x - ray pulse profiles observed by _",
    "rxte_/pca in the 9 - 13 kev range with 35-d phase can be explained by a model which assumes a freely precessing neutron star with complex surface magnetic field structure .",
    "in addition to the canonical magnetic poles ( of a dipole field ) , bright arc - like or quasi - circular structures must be present around the poles .",
    "as was first considered in , to form such structures around the poles , the magnetic field of ns must have substantially non - dipole structure .",
    "the appearance of complex emitting regions on the surface of an accreting ns with non - dipole magnetic field was confirmed by detailed numerical 3d mhd simulations ( @xcite ) .    due to the free precession , the emitting regions on the ns surface change location with respect to the line of sight leading to gradual change of x - ray profiles with the 35-d cycle phase .",
    "more rapid changes in pulse profiles ( which are observed at the end of the main - on state ) can be additionally caused by the eclipse of the ns surface by the inner parts of the disk . at low states ( when the x - ray source is hidden behind the accretion disk ) , only a sine - line component ( mostly pronounced in soft x - rays ) due to reflection of x - ray emission of the ns by the inner warped parts of the twisted accretion disk remains .",
    "we also show that in our model the times of phase zero of the ns precession ( defined by the maximum angle between the brightest spot on the ns surface and the ns angular momentum vector ) , as derived from modeling of pulse profiles in individual 35-day cycles , make straight line segments on the o - c diagram , which closely follow the shape of the turn - ons of the source , suggesting the presence of a stable clock over periods up to several tens of 35-day cycles .",
    "the change in slope of the linear segments in the o - c diagram implies a variable free precession period with a fractional period change @xmath6 .",
    "the possible reason for the free precession period variations is the corresponding @xmath7 change in angle between the principal axis of inertia of the neutron star body and the total angular momentum during the accretion of matter onto the ns with complex surface magnetic field .",
    "the apparent change of x - ray pulse profiles with 35-day cycle has been previously addressed in several papers .",
    "trmper et al . ( 1986 ) discussed change of pulse profiles in the main - on and short - on states observed by _",
    "exosat _ in terms of the neutron star free precession .",
    "later , however , the free precession model was questioned .",
    "for example , bisnovatyi - kogan et al . (",
    "1989 ) argued that the model of a freely precessing neutron star approximated by a maclaurin spheroid of rotation , with the geometrical parameters of ( symmetric ) dipole magnetic field as derived from exosat observations , is unable to explain the observed x - ray pulse profile evolution .",
    "they proposed the model of a progradely precessing accretion disk with the inner radius at @xmath8 ns radii around a ns with rather low surface magnetic field of @xmath9-@xmath10  g. in this model , the pulse profile is shaped by the inner disk eclipsing a broad emission region on the ns surface . to explain difference in pulse profiles between the main - on and short - on states of the source observed by _",
    "exosat _ , @xcite proposed an alternative qualitative model . in their model , the inner radius of the retrogradely precessing accretion disk around non",
    "- precessing neutron star was assumed to circulate synchronously with the neutron star rotation ( 1.24 s ) and to be partially responsible for the observed changes in the pulse profiles .",
    "the complex pulse shape in the main - on state was , however , attributed to the complex radiation transfer in the accretion column .",
    "the main concern about the free precession model advocated by @xcite was the secular alignment of the spin axis of the accreting ns with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "later , scott et al . ( 2000 ) analyzed the _",
    "ginga _ observations of her x-1 , and thereby provided a very detailed look at the evolution of the x - ray pulse profiles across the entire 35-day cycle .",
    "they discarded the ns free precession model ( again , in the simplest version with symmetric magnetic field and under model assumptions on the x - ray pattern ) and proposed an alternative model , in which the pulse profile is shaped by the combination of x - ray pattern effects ( pencil beam from the magnetic poles mostly seen in hard x - ray band plus softer fan beam formed at a distance of 1.5 ns radii above the ns surface ) , light bending effects in the ns strong gravitational field distorting the fan beam and forming the soft subpulses flanking the main pulse , and eclipses by the inner edge of the retrogradely precessing accretion disk located at @xmath11 ns radii .",
    "the model was shown to be capable of qualitatively reproducing the observed changes in x - ray pulse profiles with the 35-day phase .",
    "the need for a central off - set of the magnetic dipole to explain the observed changes in the pulse shape asymmetries was also noted .",
    "clearly , all the models proposed to explain the observed change of x - ray pulse profiles in her x-1 are based on a number of assumptions , whose physical justification is not always obvious . therefore , it seemed to us that a return to the free precession model of the neutron star as the underlying clock mechanism for the 35-day cycle and the cause of the visible change of x - ray pulse profiles could be useful to understand the nature of this complex source",
    ".    the wealth of excellent observational data obtained by dedicated rxte pca observations of her x-1 at different phases of the 35-day period make it possible to check a distinctive feature of the ns free precession model .",
    "if the regular pulse shape changes are due to stable ns free precession and turn - ons of the x - ray source are caused by the ( less stable ) precession of the tilted twisted accretion disk around the ns , then assuming the stable ns free precession period one would expect to observe the same pulse shapes at different phases relative to the turn - on times .",
    "in other terms , on the o - c diagram for the turn - ons , the pulses of the same shape would not follow the turn - on trend and , instead , would stay along a strict line . the slope of this line would correspond to the true period of the ns free precession .",
    "this program was pursued in the recent study by @xcite , and gave a perplexing result : contrary to expectations , phases of the template profiles constructed from the rxte database during main - on states of her x-1 closely trailed the o - c trend for turn - ons , suggesting only one 35-day clock in the system .",
    "this finding implies that either the precessing accretion disk is solely responsible for both the 35-day variability and the corresponding x - ray pulse changes ( e.g. like in @xcite and @xcite models ) , or the ns free precession is still there , but the precession period in not stable , but varies by @xmath12 , and there exists a strong synchronization between the ns free precession period and the precessional motion of the accretion disk . the occam s razor principle would incline us in favor of the first possibility , but then we have to understand why the 35-day disk precession persists over many years at around the same value ?",
    "what is the reason for the accretion disk tilt ?",
    "the possible answer could be the corresponding behavior of the optical component hz her itself ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , we think that the ns free precession as the clock mechanism of the observed 35-day periodicity remains an attractive alternative .",
    "if present , it allows synchronization of the precessional motion of the disk via dynamical effect of gas streams acting on the disk ( see @xcite ) and keeps the phase of the disk s precessional motion after anomaloue low states ( als ) of the source ( those states where the x - ray emission from the ns is blocked by the accretion disk all the times @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that accretion onto a freely precessing prolate ns with complex non - dipolar magnetic field can successfully reproduce the observed x - ray pulse profiles and their changes with the 35-day ns free precession period .",
    "the present model has several features .",
    "* a ) ns free precession*.    it is well known that free precession of a non - spherical solid body changes the angle between a given point on the body s surface and the total angular momentum vector ( if none of the inertia axes coincides with the angular momentum vector ) , therefore the location of the magnetic poles , where most of the x - ray emission is presumably generated , will change with respect to the line of sight to produce periodic modulation of the observable x - ray flux .",
    "the ns ellipticity @xmath13 , which is required to explain the @xmath2-day free precession period in her x-1 , can be a natural consequence of the presence of a strong internal toroidal magnetic field of @xmath14  g in the ns @xcite .",
    "such a field leads to a prolate form of the ns body and causes its prograde free precession . in an isolated ns ( e.g. a single pulsar ) , electromagnetic torques",
    "would secularly damp the free precession @xcite .",
    "but this can not be the case for an accreting ns subjected to torques with different signs from the disk - magnetospheric interaction .",
    "* b ) disk - magnetosphere interaction*.    the disk - magnetosphere interaction is an extremely complicated process which is not fully understood as yet and can lead to different quasi - periodic phenomena ( see , for example , recent 3d mhd simulations by @xcite ) .",
    "when a strongly magnetized ns is surrounded by a thin diamagnetic disk , the ns magnetic field will exert a torque on the disk ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if such a ns freely precesses , the torque changes with the phase of precession . a torque of the same magnitude but with the opposite sign is exerted on the ns from the disk via the magnetic field .",
    "the value and sign of this torque averaged over the ns spin period ( 1.24 s in her x-1 ) will depend on the angle between the magnetic pole and the ns angular momentum vector @xmath15 . for a dipole magnetic field",
    ", there is a critical value of this angle @xmath16 at which the spin - averaged torque on the ns vanishes , and at which the inner parts of the disk are effectively not subjected to any forces from the ns magnetic field . if @xmath17 , the inner twisted parts of the disk take a spiral - like shape with a certain direction of twisting .",
    "the inner edge of the disk then tends to co - align with the ns rotational equator . if @xmath18 , the inner disk is also twisted and tends to co - align with the ns rotational equator , but with the opposite direction of twisting .",
    "generally , the ns spin axis can be misaligned with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the initial misalignment of the ns angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum can be due to , for example , the natal kick received by the ns during its formation in a core - collapse supernova .",
    "the accreting matter brings the orbital momentum to the ns , so the spin axis of a non - precessing ns ( i.e. , with some fixed value of the angle @xmath15 ) should tend to eventually co - align with the orbital angular momentum of the binary ( this argument , we remind , was used by @xcite as evidence against the ns free precession in her x-1 ) .",
    "however , if the ns precesses , the disk - magnetosphere interaction could substantially slow down ( or stop altogether ) the secular ns  orbit alignment . indeed",
    ", the interaction of the ns with the disk tends to co - align its spin axis with the orbital momentum if @xmath18 , and counter - align for @xmath17 .",
    "the net ns angular momentum misalignment will be determined by the sum of differentials @xmath19 due to the magnetospheric torque and the angular momentum of matter supplied to ns . during one free precession period @xmath19 changes sign , and the net angular momentum misalignment",
    "can be strongly reduced in the case of accretion onto a precessing ns in comparison with a non - precessing ns .",
    "therefore , it is very likely that due to the disk - magnetosphere interaction the spin axis of a freely precessing ns in a binary system can remain tilted to the orbital angular momentum .",
    "this misalignment is important to produce a tilt of the outer parts of the accretion disk via gas streams which are non - coplanar with the orbital plane due to asymmetric illumination of the optical star atmosphere ( @xcite , but see also @xcite , for other discussions of the causes of the outer disk tilt ) .    *",
    "c ) complex structure of the ns surface magnetic field*.    in the simplest case where most of the accreting energy is released at the magnetic poles ( e.g. for a pure dipole magnetic field ) , the x - ray pulse profile would be formed by one or two components depending on the visibility conditions ( as in radio pulsars ) .",
    "however , in her x-1 the pulse profile has a very complex multi - component shape ( e.g. @xcite and below ) , which changes with the 35-d phase first smoothly and slowly and then more rapidly and strongly .",
    "observations show @xcite that the form of the pulse profiles at one precession phase is strongly dependent on energy . in the main - on state , the hard central peak flanked by two softer details",
    "is clearly seen .",
    "the sub - pulse is much less pronounced and is better seen at lower photon energies .",
    "the ratio of the height of the sub - pulse to that of the central peak also changes with the 35-d phase . to explain the observed smooth evolution of profiles at early phases of the 35-d cycle ( during the main - on state ) we introduce arc - like ( or horseshoe - like ) structures around the magnetic poles which may be due to non - dipole magnetic field structures near the ns surface @xcite",
    "this complex field structure near the surface can be formed either initially @xcite or emerge when accreting matter is solidified with the ns crust .",
    "indeed , during accretion the crust thickness near the magnetic poles increases , and the ductile spreading ( readjustment ) of the crust from poles toward the equator can begin .",
    "assuming the strong freezing of the magnetic field into the conducting crust , the deformation of the initial dipole field into quadrupole and more complex configurations will naturally occur . as a result , at a distance of several ns radii above the ns surface , regions with close to zero field strength are formed in the magnetosphere of the accreting ns , where the accreting flux can split into different channels .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that the x - ray emission can be generated both in the usual magnetic poles ( which can be shifted due to the dipole off - set in the ns body ) and in arclets , horseshoes , or ring - like structures surrounding the magnetic poles .",
    "this natural process during accretion onto a magnetized ns can split the initial large - scale magnetic field into smaller substructures , which could dissipate more rapidly due to magnetic field reconnection .",
    "to explain the observed evolution of x - ray pulse profiles with 35-day phase , the following model is proposed .",
    "the model includes the geometrical parameters of the ns ( shape , viewing angle ) and properties of the emitting regions ( their location on the ns surface and emission diagrams ) .    *",
    "a ) ns body*. the ns represented by a solid body with two but not three equal principal moments of inertia , @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ f : nsbody ] ) .",
    "the axis of the larger principal moment of inertia ( axis @xmath21 in the figure ) is inclined relative to the angular momentum vector @xmath22 by an angle @xmath23 . if there are no external torques , such a body should freely precess around its principal axis @xmath21 in the sense coincident with the spin ( prograde precession ) or opposite to it ( retrograde precession ) , depending on whether the precession occurs around the minimum ( @xmath24 , prolate body ) or maximum ( @xmath25 , oblate body ) moment of inertia , respectively . to describe features on the ns surface ,",
    "we choose a reference frame fixed inside the ns body with the polar axis directed along the inertia axis @xmath21 .",
    "below , all coordinates on the ns surface will be given in terms of the latitude @xmath26 ( with zero at the inertia equator ) and longitude @xmath27 counted counter - clockwise in the northern hemisphere , with the zero meridian passing through the axis of inertia and the north magnetic pole .",
    "* b ) viewing angle of the ns spin axis . *",
    "the her x-1 binary system is observed virtually edge - on , at a binary inclination angle of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the observed evolution of pulses is best reproduced for the angle between the direction towrd the observer and the rotational equator of the neutron star @xmath29 ( i.e. when this direction makes an angle of @xmath30 with the ns spin axis , see fig .",
    "this means that during one rotation of the ns the direction toward the observer draws on the ns surface a small circle lying @xmath29 below the ns rotational equator .",
    "this circle is shown in fig . 2 by the solid ( red ) line .",
    "for the nearly edge - on binary system , this geometry is natural if the ns spin axis is coaligned with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "however , as discussed above , the ns initial spin - orbit misalignment can be maintained for a long time due to disk - magnetosphere interaction around the freely precessing ns ; in that case the ns spin axis lying almost in the plane normal to the line of sight is by chance .",
    "* c ) emission regions*. as discussed above , complex shape of the x - ray profiles in her x-1 requires several emission components .",
    "we associate them with different emission regions on the ns surface .",
    "the two principal emission spots include the magnetic poles where accreting matter is channeled by the ns magnetosphere .",
    "however , if there is a more complex structure of the ns surface magnetic field , there could be additional emission regions . from the analysis of x - ray profiles in her x-1 it",
    "was suggested earlier that the ns surface magnetic field can have a quadrupole structure . in the simplest case of an additional quadrupole component aligned with the magnetic dipole , matter can accrete onto a ring around the magnetic pole .",
    "such a structure of emitting regions around magnetic poles was confirmed by 3d numerical mhd - simulations by @xcite .",
    "it was found in the latter paper that for an inclined dipole plus quadrupole the matter accretes onto ring - like structures ( arcs ) around the magnetic pole .",
    "the form of these arcs can be more complex , especially if the center of symmetry of the magnetic dipole is offset from the center of the ns .",
    "* c ) magnetic poles*. the north ( n ) magnetic pole has coordinates @xmath31 , that is the angle between the n - pole and the inertia axis is @xmath32 .",
    "the south ( s ) pole has coordinates @xmath33 , i.e. lies very close to the inertia axis ; it is observed always by about the same angles during the ns precession period .",
    "* d ) arcs*. it is convenient to describe the arcs by the coordinates of their centers , the radius ( in degrees ) , and the coordinates of the arc beginning and end in degrees counted along the circle with the specified radius from the zero meridian .",
    "several emission arcs were found to be needed to describe the x - ray pulse profiles in her x-1 .",
    "their positions are specified in table [ t : emregions ] .",
    "* e ) transient features*. in addition to permanently emitting regions on the ns surface ( poles , arcs ) , transient emitting features appear in several cycles .",
    "they represent some spots and arcs which ordinarily do not contribute to the total emission , but sometimes appear quite strong and are responsible for the emergence of distinct features in the pulse profile .",
    "the appearance of these features sometimes repeated in different cycles , so we believe them to be real transient emitting regions on the ns surface . their location is also specified in table [ t : emregions ] ( p1  transient pole , a1 , a2 , a3  transient arcs ) .",

    "<S> accretion of matter onto the surface of a freely precessing neutron star with a complex non - dipole magnetic field can explain the change of x - ray pulse profiles of her x-1 observed by rxte with the phase of the 35-day cycle . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this using all available measurements of x - ray pulse profiles in the 9 - 13 kev energy range obtained with the rxte / pca . </S>",
    "<S> the measured profiles guided the elaboration of a geometrical model and the definition of locations of emitting poles , arcs , and spots on the ns surface which satisfactorily reproduce the observed pulse profiles and their dependence on free precession phase . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the observed trend of the times of the 35-day turn - ons on the o - c diagram , which can be approximated by a collection of consecutive linear segments around the mean value , can be described by our model by assuming a variable free precession period , with a fractional period change of about a few percent . under this assumption and using our model , we have found that the times of phase zero of the neutron star free precession ( which we identify with the maximum separation of the brightest spot on the neutron star surface with the ns spin axis ) occur about 1.6 days after the the mean turn - on times inside each stable epoch , producing a linear trend on the o - c diagram with the same slope as the observed times of turn - ons . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the 2.5% changes in the free precession period that occur on time scales of several to tens of 35-day cycles can be related to wandering of the principal inertia axis of the ns body due to variations in the patterns of accretion onto the ns surface . </S>",
    "<S> the closeness of periods of the disk precession and the ns free precession can be explained by the presence of a synchronization mechanism in the system , which modulates the dynamical interaction of the gas streams and the accretion disk with the ns free precession period .    </S>",
