    "vertical cavity surface emitting lasers ( vcsel ) have recently attracted intensive experimental and theoretical effort .",
    "one of the major advantages vcsels have over conventional semiconductor lasers is the highly symmetric geometry around the axis of laser light emission .",
    "the polarization of light emitted from vcsels is therefore not determined by the massive anisotropy of the device architecture , as is the case in edge emitting lasers . instead , due to the transverse symmetry of the cavity and the active region the polarization is highly sensitive to more subtle effects , such as small anisotropies in the crystal structure , strain or optical anisotropies in the mirrors @xcite .",
    "experiments have already provided a large range of results on polarization as a function of pumping current @xcite .",
    "the variety of results indicates the sensitive dependence of polarization on very small effects .",
    "however , the connection between the observed stability or bistability of linear polarization and the theoretical explanations offered are still no more than tentative .    in 1995 , san miguel , feng and moloney introduced a rate equation model for quantum well vcsels , based on the observation , that the electron - hole pairs in the bands closest to the band gap can be separated into electron - hole pairs emitting only right circular polarized light and electron - hole pairs emitting only left circular polarized light @xcite . effectively , this corresponds to two independent reservoirs of electron hole pairs , each characterized by its own electron - hole pair density , coupled only by spin relaxation processes . in the following",
    ", this assumption will be refered to as the split density model .",
    "the first major result derived from this model has been the proposal that polarization stability may be a consequence of a frequency anisotropy due to birefringence in the optical cavity @xcite .",
    "as opposed to the more straightforward assumption of a gain - loss anisotropy , the frequency anisotropy may give rise to polarization switching as the injection current is increased .",
    "however , since polarization switching may also be induced by temperature related effects @xcite , the fact that polarization switching is experimentally observed is not sufficient to verify the assumption of dominating frequency anisotropies .",
    "although further work based on the split density model of san miguel and coworkers has been recently forthcoming @xcite , the predictions made by the model have so far been insufficient to truly rule out the presence of alternative mechanisms . in particular",
    ", no attempts have yet been made to determine the anisotropies and the time scales involved in the laser process directly from the laser emission during cw operation .    in order to demonstrate that such a direct test of the model is indeed possible , we investigate the polarization fluctuations predicted by the langevin equations derived from the split density model .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach is that polarization fluctuations can be measured at a fixed injection current during cw operation .",
    "deriving the anisotropies from fluctuation measurements provides not only a tool for testing the theory , but can also provide information about temperature dependent changes in the anisotropies . in this way , our theory may help to resolve questions such as those raised in @xcite and @xcite .    in section  [ sec : rate ] of this paper , we formulate the full rate equations of the split density model , using the normalized stokes parameters to describe light field polarization . in section  [ sec : langevin ] , we examine the most likely case of a frequency anisotropy and a gain - loss anisotropy along the same or two orthogonal crystal axes .",
    "the linearized langevin equations for the stationary point are derived . in section  [ sec : solution ] , the solution of the langevin equation is given , using reasonable approximations with regard to the time scales involved . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , the results are discussed and possible experiments are proposed .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] , conclusions and an outlook are presented .",
    "if only the lowest lying conduction bands and the highest lying valence bands contribute to the laser process in a quantum well structure , the preservation of angular momentum around the axis perpendicular to the quantum well and the fact that photons which are emitted along this axis have angular momenta of @xmath1 ( corresponding to either left or right circular polarization ) limits the number of possible emission processes to two separate transitions .",
    "conduction band electrons with a spin of + 1/2 around the axis perpendicular to the well can only recombine with heavy holes of -3/2 angular momentum around this axis , emitting a photon with an angular momentum of -1 .",
    "( note , that a hole with an angular momentum of -3/2 corresponds to an empty electronic level with an angular momentum of + 3/2 . ) correspondingly , spin -1/2 electrons only recombine with holes of + 3/2 angular momentum , emitting photons with an angular momentum of + 1 .",
    "this means that effectively two completely distinct pools of electron - hole pairs exist . in one pool",
    "each electron - hole pair has an angular momentum of -1 and interacts only with right circular polarized light .",
    "the electron - hole pairs in the other pool , having an angular momentum of + 1 per pair , interact only with left circular polarized light .",
    "rate equations based on this assumption have originally been formulated by san miguel and coworkers in @xcite . in the following",
    "we adopt the notion of the split density model and considerably extend the analysis towards a generalized representation able to accomodate in the model arbitrary types of anisotropies .      as in the paper by san miguel @xcite",
    ", we use the variables d for the total electron - hole density and d for the difference between the densities of electron - hole pairs with + 1 and with -1 angular momentum .",
    "we will use a somewhat different approach to describe the light field in the cavity , however , to emphasize the difference between light field intensity and light field polarization .",
    "the total number of photons in the cavity ( regardless of polarization ) is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the polarization is then described by a three dimensional vector of unit length , * p * , which defines the point on the poincare sphere corresponding to the present polarization .",
    "the components of * p * are the normalized stokes parameters .",
    "if @xmath3 are the complex electric field amplitudes of right and left circular light , the normalized stokes parameters are given by    @xmath4    the spatial directions of the vector * p * correspond to pairs of orthogonal polarizations .",
    "the component of * p * along any given direction is equal to the intensity difference between the two polarizations relative to the total intensity .",
    "@xmath5 is the intensity difference between left and right circular polarization , @xmath6 is the intensity difference between x and y polarization and @xmath7 is the intensity difference between light polarized along the ( 1,1 ) direction and light polarized along the ( 1,-1 ) direction . in the plane of linear polarization , a rotation of * p * by 180 degrees therefore corresponds to a 90 degree change in the direction of polarization .",
    "while this may not seem a very intuitive picture at first , one of the advantages of describing the light field in terms of * p * is that it directly refers to light field intensities as they are observed in experiment .",
    "the laser process in the split density model for quantum well vcsels is characterized by four timescales and three anisotropies . from slowest to fastest",
    ", the timescales are defined by    1 .",
    "the rate of spontaneous emission into the laser mode @xmath8 , usually around @xmath9 to @xmath10 , although this can be very much a function of cavity design @xcite .",
    "2 .   the rate of spontaneous carrier decay @xmath11 , usually around @xmath12 to @xmath13 , which also depends strongly on the cavity . in fact",
    ", the reduction of this decay into non - laser modes is at the heart of a proposal to achieve thresholdless lasing by optimizing the optical cavity @xcite .",
    "3 .   the rate of spin relaxation @xmath14 .",
    "this rate is an unknown quantity , especially in the high carrier density regime crucial to the laser structures under investigation . in this model",
    ", it appears only as the sum with the spontaneous carrier decay which we define as @xmath15 .",
    "experiments and theory indicate , however , that the order of magnitude will probably be similar to that of @xmath11 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "4 .   the rate of photon emission from the cavity @xmath16 .",
    "the factor of 2 in the rate of spontaneous emission is a result of using photon number and intensity variables instead of the field amplitudes to describe the light in the cavity .",
    "also , note that both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are averages over anisotropic properties of the vcsel .",
    "the three possible anisotropies in gain , loss and frequency are characterized by both their magnitude and by their geometrical orientation .",
    "similar to the definition of the stokes vector @xmath19 , it is possible to represent the anisotropies by vectors .",
    "the direction of this vector corresponds to the direction of * p * for which the extremal gain / loss / frequency values are obtained .",

    ", the frequency shift causes an effective birefringence @xcite .    to understand the terms in the equation , it is important to keep in mind that each time @xmath18 or @xmath17 appear in the equations , they are modified by the anisotropy factors of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . in the model",
    "this is the only influence of the anisotropies on the dynamics of @xmath29 and @xmath2 if @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath31 , the last terms in ( 2a ) and ( 2b ) increase or decrease the rate of stimulated emission , depending on whether the light field in the cavity interacts more strongly or more weakly with the available carriers . the last term in ( 2c ) describes the hole burning effect of @xmath32 .",
    "the dynamics of the stokes parameters @xmath19 is directly determined by the anisotropies .",
    "the frequency anisotropy induces a rotation around the axis defined by @xmath22 .",
    "the gain - loss anisotropy draws @xmath19 towards one of the poles along the axis defined by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , at a rate proportional to the component of @xmath33 or @xmath34 orthogonal to @xmath19 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ stokes ] .    the effect of the split density model on the polarization dynamics can be understood in terms of gain and frequency anisotropies introduced by the density difference @xmath35 : @xmath36 in passing we note that another consequence of the split density model is the fact that the factor of 2 in the rate of spontaneous emission is absent .",
    "this is due to the two parallel laser processes having an induced emission rate of @xmath37 for @xmath30 and @xmath38 .",
    "the sum of the two emission rates is therefore wdn , as given above .",
    "although a large number of nonlinear effects and dynamical properties can be described by chosing special combinations of anisotropies @xcite , we will concentrate on the simple case of cw operation at a stable linear polarization . for many vcsels",
    ", this seems to be the natural state of affairs , even when no artificial anisotropies were created during the growth of the device .",
    "it has been found that a large number of vcsels emit light polarized along the @xmath39 $ ] or @xmath40 $ ] crystal axes @xcite - @xcite .",
    "this must obviously be the result of unintentionally introduced anisotropies .",
    "possible reasons for this are the slight tilt of the growth axis often used in mocvd @xcite or the tendency of strain induced changes in the optical properties to produce anisotropies along these axes @xcite .",
    "the latter effect can be visualized quite nicely .",
    "if one looks at a @xmath41 $ ] surface of a semiconductor lattice , the projections of the bonds appear along the @xmath39 $ ] and the @xmath40 $ ] directions .",
    "light polarized along one of these directions will mainly interact with the electrons in the bonds along this direction .",
    "consequently , the largest part of the optical anisotropy induced by stress is caused by the difference in compression between the @xmath39 $ ] and the @xmath40 $ ] bond directions .",
    "given this preference for two orthogonal linear polarizations observed in many vcsels , we choose @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "deviations from the stationary point are described by five coupled dynamical variables . in the case under consideration",
    "the dynamics can be seperated into two mutually decoupled sub - systems .",
    "one sub - system describes the dynamics of the total photon number fluctuations @xmath51 coupled to the total density fluctuations @xmath52 .",
    "the other sub - system describes the coupling of the density difference @xmath35 to the polarization parameters @xmath7 and @xmath5 .    to obtain the linearized langevin equation",
    ", we further add the noise term * f*(t ) to the dynamics .",
    "this time dependent five dimensional vector incorporates all external noise and signals influencing the laser . in the case under consideration , this will be the vacuum fluctuations of the light field entering the cavity .",
    "a discussion of the statistical properties of this noise term will be given in the next subsection .",
    "at this point , it is convenient to introduce five new parameters for a more compact formulation :    1 .",
    "the injection current in units of the threshold current is defined as x , which means that the stationary photon number @xmath49 is replaced by @xmath53 2 .",
    "the gain - loss anisotropy is combined into a single variable @xmath54 equal to the difference of the two , scaled with the ratio of cavity loss rate and spontaneous carrier decay .",
    "this dimensionless quantity should be of the order of unity to be effective , corresponding to a relative anisotropy of about 0.1 percent for typical timescales : @xmath55 3 .",
    "the frequency anisotropy is scaled in terms of the spontaneous carrier decay rate divided by @xmath0 , as it only stabilizes the polarization in conjunction with @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath56 4 .",
    "the ratio of spin relaxation rate and spontaneous carrier decay rate is written as @xmath57 , such that @xmath58 5 .",
    "the relaxation oscillation frequency @xmath59 is defined as a function of the injection current @xmath60 : @xmath61    using these parameters , the langevin equation for the quantum well vcsel is @xmath62\\ ] ] all processes described by this equation occur either at a rate of @xmath11 or at a rate of @xmath59 . since it is realistic to assume that @xmath63 , the spontaneous carrier decay rate @xmath11 will usually be significantly smaller than the relaxation oscillation frequency @xmath64 .",
    "note that this condition breaks down very close to threshold ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "however , as close to threshold the relative polarization fluctuations approach infinity there is no polarization stability for @xmath60 very close to one .",
    "although the formulation given above can be applied also to problems of externally injected fields and similar linear response problems , we will now define the noise term @xmath66 as the electro - magnetic field noise entering the cavity from the vacuum .",
    "the definition of a noise term for the light field in a cavity is a standard procedure in quantum optics . in the case of two modes of orthogonal polarization ,",
    "the extension is straightforward .",
    "the two time correlation functions which are non - zero are    @xmath67    to understand the derivation of these terms , one may either think in terms of a classical field , considering the vacuum modes and the dipole densities associated with the carrier density pools as field modes with random quantum fluctuations acting as external forces on the field in the cavity , or one may apply particle picture reasoning : since only whole photons are emitted into and out of the cavity , there is a stochastic process involved which gives rise to shot noise .",
    "it is one of the fascinating properties of quantum mechanics , that the same noise terms result from two seemingly different pictures .",
    "another noise source for the laser process is the noise in the carrier injection .",
    "however , this noise is much weaker than the light field noise if @xmath68 , which is a natural assumption for real devices .",
    "the physical reason for the relative smallness of shot noise from injection is that , if the photon emission rate from the cavity is much faster than the total carrier decay rate , then the number of carriers present in the active region is far greater than the number of photons in the cavity .",
    "consequently , the relative statistical fluctuations are much smaller in the carrier subsystem than in the light field .",
    "note that this approximation is only valid for short timescales . on timescales",
    "much longer than the @xmath69 , energy conservation requires the fluctuations described here to cancel .",
    "this means that the low frequency noise of the power spectrum is very sensitive to the weak fluctuations in the carrier injection @xcite .",
    "in accordance with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , the noise in the light emitted from the laser is approximately given by a linear response to the quantum noise entering the laser cavity .",
    "the fluctuations can therefore be calculated from the linear response of the vcsel .",
    "the five dimensional greensfunction can be obtained by determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the non - symmetric five by five matrix describing the linearized dynamics . since the eigenvectors are non - orthogonal , both left and right eigenvectors need to be determined .",
    "the problem separates into one two dimensional problem and one three dimensional problem .",
    "therefore , an exact analytical solution is possible .",
    "however , to understand the physical significance and to single out the experimentally relevant case , it is useful to apply the realistic assumption that , since @xmath70 , @xmath71 , except for x very close to 1 . also , the anisotropies @xmath54 and @xmath72 should not be much greater than 1 .",
    "using these assumptions , the eigenvalues @xmath73 and eigenvectors @xmath74 and @xmath75 are + @xmath76 @xmath77 + @xmath78 @xmath79 + @xmath80 @xmath81 + using this set of vectors , any external perturbation of field variables or carrier densities can be decomposed into the eigenvectors with the corresponding exponentially decaying and oscillating greensfunction .",
    "the time integral over the perturbation then gives the linear response of the laser dynamics .",
    "this procedure can now be applied to quantum noise .",
    "the left eigenvectors @xmath74 are used to decompose the noise into contributions associated with the corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "if the noise terms are represented in the form of a five by five diffusion matrix @xmath82 @xcite , the decomposition can be accomplished by calculating the matrix elements @xmath83 .",
    "the fluctuation matrix @xmath84 can then be expressed as a sum over the dyadic products of the right eigenvectors @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath85 as the eigenvectors are not orthogonal , there are contributions for @xmath86 with complex @xmath87 .",
    "since we apply the approximation that @xmath71 , however , the absolute value of these terms is much smaller than those with @xmath88 and we can obtain the light field fluctuations by summing over the five terms with @xmath88 only .",
    "this effectively means that the eigenvectors fluctuate independently .",
    "the fluctuation matrix is then given by a sum over projection operators which must be symmetric .",
    "the light field fluctuations of polarized light have three degrees of freedom , given by the total intensity n , the ellipticity @xmath5 and the direction of linear polarization @xmath7 . including possible correlations ,",
    "these fluctuations are described by a symmetric three by three matrix . however , since the dynamics of the total total intensity is decoupled from the polarization dynamics , there is no correlation between the total intensity and the polarization .",
    "therefore , four fluctuation terms are sufficient to completely describe the fluctuations in the laser light during cw operation : @xmath89 the factor @xmath90 is a measure of the overall magnitude of noise . @xmath91",
    "[ distrib ] shows the noise distribution at @xmath92 for a realistic choice of parameters .",
    "[ flucts ] shows the polarization fluctuations as a function of @xmath93 .",
    "there is a correlation between the two fluctuations , mediated by @xmath0 , which is a typical feature of the two density model .",
    "the @xmath0 factor converts the density difference fluctuations @xmath35 into frequency difference fluctuations between left and right circular polarization .",
    "this fluctuating birefringence causes the direction of polarization to fluctuate in phase with the ellipticity .",
    "the fluctuations of the carrier density have not been given here , since they are difficult to observe experimentally .",
    "they would be strongly correlated with the oscillating field terms , being 90  degrees out of phase with respect to the fluctuations of the field .",
    "because of this correlation effect , fluctuations in the direction of polarization @xmath7 are always much stronger than fluctuations in the ellipticity @xmath5 if @xmath0 is greater than 1 . indeed , the values of 2 to 6 given for @xmath0 in the literature suggest a difference of almost an order of magnitude .    another typical feature of the polarization fluctuations is that they approach infinity close to threshold .",
    "this is an indicator that the light emitted very close to threshold is still lamp like .",
    "a non vanishing amount of laser emission is necessary to overcome the noise effects and to stabilize both the intensity and the polarization .",
    "although three unknown parameters , r , @xmath54 and @xmath72 , enter into the model , the polarization noise terms calculated here are defined by only two parameters , namely @xmath94 and @xmath95 . to fully separate the effects of spin relaxation and of anisotropy",
    ", one additional parameter is needed .",
    "this additional parameter may be found by taking a closer look at the nearly degenerate oscillation frequencies in the intensity and in the polarization .",
    "the relaxation oscillations appear equally in the total intensity and in the polarization fluctuations .",
    "this is a direct result of the two density model : ellipticity fluctuations and the associated fluctuations in the polarization direction are a result of uncorrelated intensity fluctuations in the two circular polarizations .",
    "however , anisotropies couple the two subsystems and induce slight changes in the frequency . by calculating the difference between the relaxation oscillations in intensity and in polarization , further information on the anisotropies can be obtained .",
    "the perturbative correction to the eigenvalues may be obtained by calculating the matrix elements @xmath96 between the approximate eigenvectors @xmath74 and @xmath97 .",
    "the correction to the eigenvalue @xmath73 caused by a weak coupling to the eigenstates of @xmath98 is given by @xmath99 .",
    "calculated to second order in @xmath100 , the eigenvalue corrections are @xmath101 for the total photon number and @xmath102 for the polarization variables .",
    "the difference in frequency between the intensity oscillations @xmath103 and the polarization oscillations @xmath104 is @xmath105.\\ ] ] note that only a frequency anisotropy will make @xmath104 larger than @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , if the polarization noise oscillates faster than the intensity noise , this is an indicator of a strong frequency anisotropy .",
    "the equations given above show the wealth of information that can be obtained from measurements of the fluctuations in the laser light emitted from a vcsel during cw operation at a stable linear polarization .",
    "intensity noise is given by the relaxation rate @xmath106 , the oscillation frequency @xmath59 and the relative magnitude of @xmath107 .",
    "experimental determination of these three quantities is equivalent to a measurement of the three timescales @xmath108 , @xmath11 and w(1+g ) .",
    "the ellipticity noise @xmath109 differs from intensity noise in the relaxation rate , which is @xmath110 instead of @xmath106 , and in the relaxation frequency , although the latter is only slightly different .",
    "these timescales also show up in the correlation of ellipticity and polarization direction fluctuations , @xmath111 , which is just @xmath0 times the ellipticity fluctuations .",
    "an observation of this correlation can provide not only strong evidence in support of the split density model , but is also a direct measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , the fluctuations of polarization direction , @xmath112 , include not only noise correlated to ellipticity fluctuations , but also additional noise with a relaxation rate of @xmath113 . from the two relaxation rates and",
    "the difference in oscillation frequency , the parameters r , @xmath54 and @xmath72 can be calculated , thereby allowing an experimental determination of the spin relaxation rate , of the gain - loss aniosotropy and of the frequency anisotropy .",
    "the polarization fluctuations predicted by the split density model are largely fluctuations of the direction of linear polarization .",
    "fluctuations of the ellipticity are smaller by at least a factor of @xmath114 . for very small anisotropies",
    ", the main contribution to the fluctuations will be from the weak relaxation rate of @xmath115 , implying an even greater discrepancy between fluctuations in ellipticity and in polarization direction .    to estimate the relative anisotropies necessary to stabilize polarization , it is therefore most appropriate to require the condition @xmath116 to be fulfilled . for reasonable estimates ,",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath72 should then be at least of order 1 .",
    "this would necessitate a relative gain - loss anisotropy @xmath117 of at least @xmath118 or a frequency anisotropy of at least 1  ghz .    however , these values depend critically on the timescales of the laser process , all of which enter into the magnitude of the fluctuations given by @xmath90",
    ".      to determine the timescales and the anisotropies of quantum well vcsels as described above , time resolved measurements of the polarization fluctuations at a resolution of at least picoseconds are required .",
    "further , polarization filters for both linear and circular polarization are needed .",
    "ideally , @xmath7 and @xmath5 could be measured directly by separating the laser beam using a birefringent material and measuring the intensity difference between the two parts .",
    "however , it is also possible to measure the fluctuations by inserting a filter and measuring the fluctuations in @xmath119 . since the fluctuations in n",
    "are not correlated with the fluctuations in polarization , the resulting relative noise is just the avarage of total intensity noise and polarization noise .",
    "e.g.  if one measures the fluctuations in the intensity of right circular polarized light @xmath120 one obtains @xmath121 a measurement of the correlation of ellipticity and polarization direction fluctuations is very difficult , since it requires a splitting of the laser beam without causing undesireable polarizations .",
    "probably the best approach would be to reflect only a small fraction of the beam at a right angle , using this light for the measurement of linear polarization direction and using the nearly unaltered beam for the measurement of ellipticity fluctuations .",
    "another possibility is to keep track of all the polarization properties of the optical devices used , sorting out the contributions to the measured noise afterwards .",
    "the stokes parameters are quite convenient for this task , since all polarization effects can be described by matrix multiplication .    in this manner , all timescales and anisotropies can be determined at a fixed injection current . if such an experiment works , it is also possible to measure changes in these properties as injection current is increased .",
    "a comparison with the temperature dependence at constant injection current is also possible .",
    "this should reveal a lot of the material properties of the semiconductor and help to clear up some of the open questions regarding polarization switching .",
    "the analysis presented here shows how all the parameters of the two density model for a vcsel with stable linear polarization can be obtained from measurements of the polarization fluctuations .",
    "time resolved measurements of the polarization fluctuations in vcsel light can therefore unambiguously resolve open questions , such as whether temperature effects cause polarization switching or whether birefringence or gain - loss anisotropies are responsible for polarization stability .",
    "this is extremely important , because experimental results on polarization and intensity as a function of the injection current can only be interpreted when the correct mechanism of polarization stability has been identified .",
    "for example , the authors of @xcite assume that only a frequency anisotropy contributes to polarization stability without considering the possibility that a gain - loss anisotropy might have an effect as well .",
    "unverified assumptions are also the subject of the criticism voiced in @xcite about the explanations given in @xcite .",
    "further experiments such as the ones proposed here are absolutely necessary to avoid misleading interpretations .",
    "the polarization fluctuations show features typical for the split density model , which can be used as a test criterium for whether the model is valid in a given device or not . since the split density represents the effect of quantum well confinement on the polarization properties of vcsels , this effectively tests the quantum well structure in the active region .",
    "the quantity which depends strongly on the size of the quantum wells is the spin relaxation rate .",
    "experimental results on this rate are also of interest in connection with calculations @xcite and luminesence experiments @xcite carried out to investigate spin flip scattering in quantum wells .",
    "the rate equations presented here are formulated in a very general way and may also be applied to cases with more excotic anisotropies and timescales , such as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , which show switching and/or include a magnetic field . in all these cases ,",
    "the investigation of noise adds additional predictions for experiment to the results and thereby increases our understanding of the physics involved in the polarization properties of vcsels ."

    "<S> langevin equations are derived on the basis of a generalized rate equation model in which the influence of competing gain - loss and frequency anisotropies is included . </S>",
    "<S> this reveals how the anisotropies and the quantum well confinement effects shape the correlations and the magnitude of fluctuations in ellipticity and in polarization direction . </S>",
    "<S> according to our results all parameters used in the rate equations may be obtained experimentally from precise time resolved measurements of the intensity and polarization fluctuations in the emitted laser light . to clarify the effects of anisotropies and of quantum well confinement on the laser process in vcsels we therefore propose time resolved measurements of the polarization fluctuations in the laser light . in particular , such measurements allow to distinguish the effects of frequency anisotropy and of gain - loss anisotropy and would provide data on the spin relaxation rate in the quantum well structure during cw operation as well as representing a new way of experimentally determinig the linewidth enhancement factor @xmath0 . </S>"
