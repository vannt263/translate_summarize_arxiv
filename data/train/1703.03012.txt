    "the phonon spectrum only changes slightly with the inclusion of soc .",
    "the frequencies of the highest optical modes are pushed upward by about 0.36  mev ( 2.5  % ) across the whole bz , while the lowest acoustic branch softens along the @xmath34z direction .",

    "[ fig2](c ) , the eliashberg spectral function follows the trend of the phdos and exhibits a similar peak structure .",
    "although the phonons from all energy regions contribute to the total epc , the relative contributions of each set of modes differ considerably .",
    "the low - energy modes ( up to 8.0  mev ) account for approximately 60% of the total coupling ( @xmath40 ) , while the phonons in the intermediate- and high - energy regions have a less sizable contribution of 22% and 18% , respectively . with inclusion of soc",

    "the soc - induced enhancement of @xmath41 correlates with the increased density of states at the fermi level and the softening of the low - energy phonon modes .",
    "in particular , the phonons in the low - energy region account for 0.15 of the total increase in @xmath41 , while the phonons in the intermediate- and high - energy regions only account for 0.01 and 0.04 , respectively .",
    "after assessing the epc , we investigate its effect on the superconducting pairing mechanism .",

    ", the superconducting gap vanishes at a critical temperature @xmath45  k ( without soc ) and @xmath46  k ( with soc ) , close to the lower limit of the reported experimental values ranging from 4.25  k to 5.4  k@xcite . in order to test the sensitivity of our results to the parameters entering in the migdal - eliashberg equations",

    "the same figures under three different perspectives are shown in supplemental fig .",
    "s3  @xcite .",
    "we can clearly see that the gap opens on both the electron and hole pockets , and the magnitude of the gap changes greatly on some of the fermi surface sheets .",
    "an essentially isotropic distribution is observed on the bi - dominated inner hole fs1 pocket and the central region of the three - dimensional electron fs3 sheet with mixed bi and pd orbital character . on the contrary ,",
    "the other parts of the fermi surface display a strong anisotropy , in particular , the nearly cylindrical fs2 sheet shows the largest spread in @xmath47 .",
    "although the topology of the superconducting gap on the fermi surface is practically not modified by the inclusion of the soc , there is a noticeable difference between the absolute value of the gap on the inner fermi surface . in the latter case ,",
    "the superconducting gap is no longer characterized by a small spread around the minimum value , but around the average value of @xmath47 .",
    "this change is likely driven by the softening of the lowest acoustic branch along the @xmath34z direction which involves mainly out - plane bi@xmath48 phonons .",
    "the structure of the gap correlates closely with the variation of the electron - phonon coupling strength on the individual fermi surface sheets shown in supplemental fig .",

    "moreover , they differ strikingly from the earlier specific heat measurements ( magenta circles ) , disproving the suggestion of multigap superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "the argument for a multigap scenario presented in ref .",

    "<S> the calculated superconducting energy gap on the fermi surface , the superconducting transition temperature , the specific heat , and the quasi - particle density of states are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental results and support the view that @xmath0bi@xmath1pd is a phonon - mediated single anisotropic gap superconductor . </S>"
