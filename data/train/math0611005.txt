    "classical morse theory links singularities of morse functions with topology of closed manifolds .",
    "specifically , singularities of morse functions @xmath8 cause interruptions of the @xmath9-gradient flow , and the homology or even the topological type of a manifold @xmath1 can be expressed in terms of such interruptions ( see [ c ] ) .",
    "these terms include descending and ascending disks , attaching maps , and spaces of flow trajectories which connect the singularities .    on manifolds with boundary ,",
    "an additional source of the flow interruption occurs : it comes from a particular geometry of the boundary @xmath6 , or rather from the failure of the boundary to be _ convex _ with respect to the flow ( see definition 4.1 ) .",
    "in fact , on manifolds with boundary , one can _ trade _ the @xmath9-singularities in the interior of @xmath1 for these boundary effects . in our approach ,",
    "the boundary effects take the central stage , while the singularities themselves remain in the background . in the paper",
    ", we apply this philosophy to @xmath10-manifolds .",
    "many of our results allow for straightforward multidimensional generalizations , the other are specifically three - dimensional .",
    "some of our theorems are in the spirit of the pioneering work of i. ishii on , so - called , _ flow - spines _ [ i ] , [ i1 ] ( see also a recent paper by y. koda [ ko ] and an excellent monograph `` branched standard spines of 3-manifolds '' by benedetti and petronio [ bp ] , followed by [ bp1 ] ) . in an earlier version of this paper [ k ] , we managed to overlook all this line of research ... as we will introduce the relevant constructions , we will describe some technical differences between the flow - spines of [ i ] and the branched spines of [ gr1 ] , [ bp ] , on one hand , and the gradient spines on the other . for",
    "now , it is sufficient to say that any generic gradient flow defines its gradient spine in a _ canonical _ way , and that we allow for fields @xmath5 that are not necessarily concave with respect to the boundary @xmath6 .",
    "our motivation comes from the desire to understand better the interplay between the intrinsic concavity of @xmath6 with respect to generic gradient flows and the topology of the underlining 3-fold @xmath1 .",
    "we conjecture that there exists a numerical topological invariant that measures the failure of convexity with respect to any nonsingular gradient flow_some manifolds intrinsically are just more concave than others ... _ \" in a sense , the gradient complexity @xmath7 , introduced in this paper , can serve as a crude measure of intrinsic concavity of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , a 3-manifold @xmath1 with a connected boundary which admits a convex gradient - like field @xmath5 is a handlebody ; so a random manifold does not admit convex nonsingular gradient flows . for instance",
    ", @xmath11 constitutes an obstruction to the convexity for any nonsingular gradient flow . at the same time",
    ", any manifold with boundary admits a _ strictly concave _ traversing ( but not necessarily a gradient ! ) flow [ bp ] .",
    "the combinatorial complexity theory of matveev ( [ m ] ) helps us to uncover the behavior of generic nonsingular gradient - type flows on 3-folds or , rather , the interactions of such flows with the boundary . before describing these results in full generality ,",
    "let us give to the reader their taste .",
    "for example , we prove that on a manifold @xmath1 , obtained from the poincar homology sphere by removing an open disk , any nonsingular gradient - like flow has at least _ five _ trajectories that are tangent to the boundary @xmath6 , each one at a _ pair _ of distinct points ; moreover @xmath1 admits a gradient - like flow with not more than @xmath12 such trajectories .",
    "another example is provided by the remarkable hyperbolic manifold @xmath13 that has the minimal ( among hyperbolic manifolds ) volume @xmath14 .",
    "by removing an open disk from @xmath13 we get a manifold @xmath1 on which any nonsingular gradient - like flow has at least _",
    "nine _ trajectories , each one tangent to the sphere @xmath6 at a pair of distinct points ; moreover @xmath1 admits a gradient - like flow with not more than @xmath15 double - tangent trajectories .",
    "a generic vector field @xmath5 on @xmath1 gives rise to a natural stratification @xmath16 by compact submanifolds , where @xmath17 .",
    "here @xmath18 is the part of the boundary @xmath19 where @xmath5 points inside @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath20 is a 1-dimensional locus where @xmath5 is _ tangent _ to the boundary @xmath6 .",
    "its portion @xmath21 consists of points where @xmath5 points inside @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , @xmath23 is a finite locus where @xmath5 is tangent to @xmath24 .",
    "finally , @xmath25 consists of points where @xmath5 points inside @xmath26 .    in his groundbreaking 1929 paper [ mo ]",
    ", morse discovered some beautiful connections of this stratification to the index of the field @xmath5 .",

    "* section 2 * starts with a sketch of main results from [ mo ] ( see theorem 2.1 and corollary 2.1 ) .",
    "it also contains one remark about the role that stratification ( 1.1 ) plays in the gauss - bonnet theorem ( see theorem 2.2 and [ g ] for an interesting general discussion ) .",
    "more importantly , we notice that , at any point @xmath27 , the @xmath5-flow defines a projection of the boundary @xmath6 into a germ of the constant level surface @xmath28 . at a generic point @xmath29",
    "this projection is a _ fold _ , while at @xmath30 it is a _",
    "cusp_. throughout the paper , these folds and cusps provide us with crucial measuring devices for probing the topology of @xmath1 .",
    "a significant portion of the paper is preoccupied with role of the cusps .",
    "* section 3 * as in [ mo ] , the stratification @xmath31 is in the focus of our investigation .",
    "here we prove that the surface @xmath18 can be subjected to 1-sugery via a deformation of the gradient - like field @xmath5 .",
    "this allows one to change the topology of the stratum @xmath18 almost at will ( see lemma 3.1 and corollary 3.1 ) .    * section 4 * for given nonsingular morse data @xmath3",
    ", we introduce the notion of @xmath32-_convexity _ , @xmath33 or @xmath10 .",
    "the 2-convexity of @xmath5 is defined as the property @xmath34 .",
    "it puts a severe restrictions on the topology of @xmath1 ( see theorem 4.2 and corollary 4.5 ) . in contract",
    ", the 3-convexity , @xmath35 , by itself has no topological significance : one can always deform @xmath3 to eliminate @xmath36 together with all other cusps ( theorem 9.5 ) .",
    "implies @xmath37 for all , so called , _ traversing _ flows .",
    "] however , when we fix the topology of @xmath18 , some combinations of cusps from @xmath23 acquire topological invariance ( corollary 9.2 ) .",
    "although convexity or its lack are defined in terms of the gradient - like fields , we can arrange for the 2-convexity if we know that singularities of @xmath38 admit a particular _ ordering _ induced by @xmath9 ( similar to the self - indexing property ) .",
    "specifically , the singularities of @xmath38 can be divided into two groups : the positive @xmath39 where the gradient @xmath0 is directed inwards @xmath1 , and the negative @xmath40 where @xmath5 is directed outwards ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . theorem 4.1 claims that when @xmath41 is _ above _",
    "@xmath42 , then one can deform the riemannian metric on @xmath1 so that the convexity of the gradient flow will be guaranteed .",
    "hence , it is impossible to find a nonsingular function @xmath9 with the property @xmath43 on 3-folds @xmath1 that are not handlebodies .",
    "in addition , theorem 4.2 describes an interplay between the dynamics of the flow @xmath5 through the  bulk \" @xmath1 and of the @xmath5-induced flow @xmath44 in @xmath45 , on the one hand , and the convexity phenomenon , on the other .    in corollary 4.5",
    ", we prove that an acyclic @xmath1 is a 3-disk if and only if one of the two properties are satisfied : ( 1 ) @xmath1 admits nonsingular 2-convex morse data @xmath3 , ( 2 ) @xmath1 admits nonsingular 3-convex morse data @xmath3 with a connected @xmath18 .",
    "* section 5 * is devoted to properties of _ gradient spines _ , a construction central to our investigations . in spirit , but not technically , it represents a special class of flow - spines [ i ] .",
    "the difference between the two classes reflects the difference between the spaces of nonsingular vector and gradient fields on a given manifold .",

    ", @xmath47 has to be rather special ( cf .",
    "[ m ] , [ bp ] ) .",
    "in fact , a generic nonsingular gradient - like field @xmath5 canonically gives rise to a spine that we call _ gradient _ ( see fig .",
    "10 , 12 ) .",
    "a gradient spine @xmath47 is a union of @xmath18 with the descending @xmath5-trajectories that pass through @xmath26 .",
    "like branched spines ( definition 6.6 ) , gradient spines inherit _ orientations _ from the boundary @xmath6 and have a _ preferred side _ in the ambient @xmath1 .",
    "exactly these properties of a gradient spine @xmath47 allow for its resolution into a surface @xmath50 homeomorphic to @xmath18 and , eventually , for a reconstruction of @xmath1 from @xmath47 ( theorem 6.1 ) . by modifying the field",
    "@xmath5 , we can arrange for @xmath18 , and thus for @xmath50 , to be homeomorphic to a disk @xmath51 . as a result",

    "14 , 15 ) .",
    "this statement is similar in flavor to theorem 1.2 , [ i ] , where disk - shaped sections of generic ( non - gradient ) flows on closed manifolds are employed for the same goal .",
    "* section 6 * deals with combinatorial structures that generalize the notion of a gradient spine @xmath47 ( see definitions 6.16.4 ) .",

    "20 ) . adding a system of , so called , @xmath53-_markers _ to @xmath47 along its singularity set @xmath54 produces an object which captures the topology of the ambient @xmath1 and admits a canonic resolution into an oriented surface",
    ". such a polyhedron @xmath47 with markers is called an _ abstract gradient spine_. unlike generic 2-complexes , each abstract gradient spine @xmath47 is a spine of some manifold ( see [ bf ] and [ k ] , appendix , theorem 10.1 ) .",
    "the notion of a @xmath55-_spine _ ( see definition 6.5 ) is still another generalization of gradient spines .",
    "it is a very close relative of branched spines .",
    "in fact , for an oriented @xmath1 , the notions of an oriented branched spine @xmath46 and of a @xmath55-spine are equivalent , provided @xmath56 being orientable ( lemma 6.3 ) . unlike abstract gradient or branched spines , the @xmath55-spines @xmath47 are defined _ extrinsically _ , that is , in terms of an embedding in @xmath1 of the vicinity of the singular set @xmath57 . by lemma 6.2 , any gradient spine is a @xmath55-spine .",
    "moreover , according to theorem 8.1 , @xmath55-spines admit a  nice \" approximation by the gradient spines of the same complexity .",
    "* section 7 * we apply ideas and results of [ m ] , which revolve around matveev s notion of combinatorial complexity of simple 2-complexes and compact 3-folds , to the gradient and @xmath55-spines .",

    "@xmath7 of a 3-fold @xmath1 with boundary as the minimal number of _ double - tangent _ trajectories that a nonsingular gradient - like field on @xmath1 can have .",

    "for instance , by theorem 7.3 , for any natural @xmath66 , there is no more than finitely many irreducible and boundary irreducible with no essential annuli 3-folds @xmath1 that admit nonsingular gradient - like flows with @xmath66 double - tangent trajectories .",
    "the number @xmath67 of such 3-folds has a crude upper bound @xmath68 , where @xmath69 stands for the number of topological types of regular four - valent graphs with @xmath66 vertices at most . in particular , there is no more than @xmath68 hyperbolic manifolds with @xmath66 double - tangent trajectories .",
