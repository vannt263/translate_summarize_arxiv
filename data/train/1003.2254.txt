    "magnetism in nanostructures has been a very active research area in the last decades  @xcite , because of its novel fundamental physics and fascinating potential applications .",
    "experimentally , modern methods of preparing metal nanowires have made it possible to investigate the influence of dimensionality on the magnetic properties .",
    "for example , gambardella , _",
    "et al._@xcite , recently succeeded in preparing a high density of parallel atomic chains along steps by growing co on a high - purity pt ( 997 ) vicinal surface and also observed one - dimensional ( 1d ) magnetism in a narrow temperature range of 10@xmath320 k. in the mean time , li , _",
    "et al._@xcite reported that fe stripes on the stepped pd(110 ) substrate have a different magnetic easy axis than previous results .",
    "structurally stable nanowires can also be grown inside tubular structures , such as the ag nanowires of micrometer lengths grown inside self - assembled organic ( calix[4]hydroquinone ) nanotubes@xcite .",
    "short suspended nanowires have been produced by driving the tip of scanning tunneling microscope into contact with a metallic surface and subsequent retraction , leading to the extrusion of a limited number of atoms from either tip or substrate@xcite .",
    "monostrand nanowires of co and pd have also been prepared in mechanical break junctions , and full spin - polarized conductance was observed@xcite .",
    "theoretically , a great deal of research has been done on both finite and infinite chains of metal atoms .",
    "theoretical calculations at either semi - empirical tight - binding or _ ab initio _ density functional theory level for many infinite / finite chains , e.g. , linear chains of co@xcite , fe@xcite , ni , pd@xcite , pt , cu@xcite , ag@xcite , and au@xcite , as well as zigzag chains of fe@xcite , zr@xcite and au@xcite , have been reported .",
    "early studies of infinite linear chains of au @xcite , cu@xcite , and pd@xcite have shown a wide variety of stable and metastable structures .",
    "recently , the magnetic properties of transition metal infinite linear chains of fe , co , ni , have been calculated @xcite .",
    "possible magnetism in @xmath4- and @xmath5-electron element linear and zigzag chains have also been studied theoretically.@xcite these calculations show that the metallic and magnetic nanowires may become important for electronic / optoelectronic devices , quantum devices , magnetic storage , nanoprobes and spintronics .    despite of the above mentioned intensive theoretical and experimental research , current understanding on the intriguing magnetic properties of nanowires and how magnetism depends their structural property is still incomplete .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to make a systematic _ ab initio _ study of the magnetic , electronic and structural properties of linear and zigzag atomic chains ( fig .",
    "1 ) of all 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 transition metals ( tm ) .",
    "transition metals , because of their partly filled @xmath0 orbitals , have a strong tendency to magnetize . nonetheless , only 3@xmath0 transition metals ( cr , mn , fe , co , and ni ) exhibit magnetism in their bulk structures .",
    "it is , therefore , of interest to investigate possible ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) magnetization in the linear chains of all 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 transition metals including y , zr , nb , la , hf and ta zigzag chain which appear not to have been considered . as mentioned before , recent _ ab initio _ calculations indicate that the zigzag chain structure of , at least , zr@xcite , ir@xcite , pt@xcite and au@xcite , is energetically more favorable than the linear chain structure .",
    "thus , we also study the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of all 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 transition metal zigzag chains in order to understand how the physical properties of the monoatomic chains evolve as their structures change from the linear to zigzag chain .",
    "relativistic electron spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is the fundamental cause of the orbital magnetization and also the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) of solids .",
    "the mae of a magnetic solid is the difference in total electronic energy between two magnetization directions , or the energy required to rotate the magnetization from one direction to another .",
    "it determines whether a magnet is a hard or soft one .",
    "furthermore , it acts to reduce the magnitude of superparamagnetic fluctuation in nanostructures , and hence is a key factor that would determine whether the nanowires have potential applications in , e.g. , high - density recording and magnetic memory devices . _",
    "ab initio _ calculations of the mae have been performed for mainly the fe and co linear chains@xcite , while semiempirical tight - binding calculations have been reported for both linear chains and two - leg ladders of fe and co@xcite .",
    "very recently , we have carried out systematic _ ab initio _ calculations of both the mae and also the magnetic dipolar ( shape ) anisotropy energy for all 3@xmath0 transition metals in both the linear and zigzag structures.@xcite remarkably , although the soc is rather weak in 3@xmath0 transition metals , compared with 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 transition metals , we found that the fm ni linear chain has a gigantic mae of @xmath312 mev / atom.@xcite therefore , as a continuing endeavor to find nanowires with a large mae , we have calculated the mae and the magnetic dipolar ( shape ) anisotropy energy for all 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 transition metals in both the linear and zigzag structures .",
    "although in this paper we study only free - standing 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 transition metal chains , the underlying physical trends found may also hold for monoatomic nanowires created transiently in break junctions@xcite or encapsulated inside 1d nanotubes@xcite or deposited on weakly interacting substrates  @xcite , _ albeit _ , with the actual values of the physical quantities being modified .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe the theory and computational details we used .",
    "the calculated structural and magnetic properties as well as band structures of the linear 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 transition metal chains are presented in sec .",
    "the calculated structural , magnetic and electronic properties of the zigzag 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 transition metal chains in both equilibrium and local energy minimum states are reported in sec .",
    "the relative stability of the linear and zigzag chain structures is analyzed in sec .",
    "v. the calculated magnetic anisotropy energies and moments of both linear and zigzag chains are presented , and also discussed in terms of the calculated @xmath0-orbital - decomposed doss in sec .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "in the present calculations , we use the accurate frozen - core full - potential projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method ,  @xcite as implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "the calculations are based on density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite . the free - standing atomic chains are modelled by a two - dimensional array of infinite long , straight or zigzag wires . for both linear and zigzag chains , the nearest wire - wire distance between the neighboring chains is , at least , 15  , which should be wide enough to decouple the neighboring wires .",
    "a large plane - wave cutoff energy of @xmath3350 ev is used for all 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 transition metal chains .    the equilibrium bond length ( lattice constant ) of the linear atomic chains in the nonmagnetic ( nm ) ,",
    "ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) states is determined by locating the minimum in the calculated total energy as a function of the interatomic distance .",
    "the results are also compared with that obtained by structural optimizations , and the differences are small ( within 0.4 % ) for , e.g. , the ru , rh and pd chains . for the zigzag chains , the theoretical atomic structure is determined by structural relaxations using the conjugate gradient method .",
    "the equilibrium structure is obtained when all the forces acting on the atoms and the axial stress are less than 0.02 ev / @xmath6 and 2.0 kbar , respectively . the @xmath7-centered monkhorst - pack scheme with a @xmath8-mesh of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) in the full brillouin zone ( bz ) , in conjunction with the fermi - dirac - smearing method with @xmath11 ev , is used to generate @xmath8-points for the bz integration .",
    "with this @xmath8-point mesh , the total energy is found to converge to within 10@xmath12 ev .",
    "because of its smallness , _ ab initio _ calculation of the mae is computationally very demanding and needs to be carefully carried out ( see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "a very fine @xmath8-point mesh with @xmath13 being 200 for both the linear and zigzag chains , is used .",
    "the same @xmath8-point mesh is used for the band structure and density of states calculations . as in our previous publication on the 3@xmath0 tm chains@xcite",
    ", we use the force theorem approach to calculate the mae , i.e. , the mae is calculated as the total energy difference between the two relativistic band structure calculations for the two different magnetization directions ( e.g. , parallel and perpendicular to the chain ) concerned using the frozen charge density obtained in a prior self - consistent scalar relativistic calculation.@xcite the total energy convergence criteria is 10@xmath14 ev / atom .",

    "3 , respectively . they are also listed in table i. the calculated total energy relative to that of the nm state ( i.e. , the magnetization energy ) of the fm and af linear atomic chains are also shown in fig .",
    "2 , fig . 3 and table i. it is clear from figs . 2 and 3 that all of the 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 tm elements except y , nb , la , ta , os and pt , become magnetic in the linear chain structure .",
    "furthermore , for all the 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 tm elements , except y , nb , la , ta , os and pt , nm state is unstable and the ground state is either fm and af ( see fig .",
    "2 , fig . 3 and table i ) . among the 4_d _ tm linear chains , the ground state for the zr , ru , rh , and pd chains is ferromagnetic while that for the mo , and tc chains is antiferromagnetic .",
    "for the 5@xmath0 tm linear chains , the ground state for the hf and ir chains is ferromagnetic and the ground state for the re and w are antiferromagnetic .",
    "the y , nb , la , ta , os and pt chains are nonmagnetic at the equilibrium bond length .",
    "we recently reported@xcite that in the 3_d _ tm linear chains , the equilibrium bond length in a magnetic state is significantly larger than that in the nonmagnetic state .",
    "for example , the magnetization induced increase in the bond length in the cr chain is 54 % .",
    "in contrast , fig .",
    "2 , fig . 3 and table",
    "i show that in the 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 tm linear chains , the difference in bond length between a magnetic ( fm or af ) state and the nm state is much smaller .",
    "the largest lattice magnetolattice expansion occurs in the af re chain but it amounts only to 3 % .",
    "this is due to much weak magnetization in the 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 linear chains , as indicated by the smaller magnetic moments and much smaller magnetization energies in these atomic chains at equilibrium ( table i ) .    to see how the magnetic properties of the atomic chains evolve with the interatomic distance , we plot the spin and orbital moments for some 4@xmath0 ( y , zr , nb , and pd ) and 5@xmath0 ( la , hf , ta , os , ir and pt ) tm chains in the fm state as a function of the bond length in fig .",
    "4 . for most selected ferromagnetic tm ( except y , la , zr and hf ) chains ,",
    "the spin moment generally becomes larger as the bond length is increased from its equilibrium value ( table i).interestingly , the spin moment of the hf chain , in contrast , decreases monotonically when the chain is elongated , and eventually disappears at the bond length of 2.7 @xmath6 [ fig .",
    "the spin moment of the zr chain decreases slightly as the bond length increases , but increases again when the bond length goes beyond @xmath32.7  .",
    "surprisingly , when the y ( la ) chain is sufficiently compressed [ at the bond length of @xmath32.35 ( 2.65 )  ] , the ferromagnetism appears , and the spin moment increases as the chain is further compressed .",
    "finally , for the y , la , ta , os and pt chains , the sufficient elongation of the bond length would induce a fm state ( fig .",
    "our calculated bond lengths , spin moments and magnetization energies generally agree rather well with available previous _ ab initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , a few notable differences exist . for example , our calculated bond length ( 2.13  ) of the af mo chain is 7.0 % smaller than that ( 2.28  ) reported in ref .",
    "but in good agreement with ref .",
    "( 2.15  ) .",
    "also , our equilibrium bond lengths of the os and pt chains are smaller than that from ref  , but the differences are within 2.7 % .",
    "another notable difference is that our calculations suggest that the os chain is nonmagnetic in equilibrium but become ferromagnetic only when the bond length is larger than @xmath32.55@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "4 ) , while , according to ref . , it is ferromagnetic at the equilibrium bond length .",
    "our calculated magnetization energies ( table i ) for the af mo and tc chains are smaller than that reported in ref .",
