    "the photoproduction of strange mesons is crucial in the search for `` missing '' nucleon resonances which have been predicted by constituent quark models but which have not been observed in non - strange photoproduction reactions  @xcite . to understand resonance structure , t - channel contributions",
    "must first be known before a partial wave analysis of s - channel contributions can be performed . in the extensively studied channel , @xmath3",
    ", there are large t - channel contributions from @xmath4 exchange ( fig.[fig : feynman](a ) ) .",
    "as the photon can not couple to @xmath5 , this does not contribute in the lesser studied channel , @xmath6 , which is therefore a cleaner probe of s - channel contributions .",
    "t - channel exchange of @xmath1 vector mesons , however , may still contribute ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman](b ) ) .",
    "@xmath5 photoproduction is therefore an ideal tool to understand @xmath1-hyperon dynamics , and contributions such as fig .",

    "elsa accelerated electrons to an energy of 3.2  gev which were incident upon a thin radiator , producing bremstrahlung photons .",
    "the photon momentum was measured via the electron deflection in a magnetic dipole spectrometer before impinging upon a liquid hydrogen target at the centre of the crystal barrel . for further details of the experimental setup",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the reaction @xmath8 was identified from the decays : @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "events were selected where six neutral particles were able to reconstruct the invariant mass of three @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath11 production was eliminated from the data set by rejecting events where the six neutral particle invariant mass was close to the @xmath11 mass .",
    "the remaining events were subject to a least squares kinematic fit routine , rejecting events which yielded a confidence level less than 0.1 .",
    "[ fig : invmass](a ) is the 2@xmath7 invariant mass versus the proton-@xmath7 invariant mass .",
    "events were selected from the @xmath12 invariant mass consistent with the @xmath13 mass ( fig .",

    "background events were subtracted by comparison with simulated , uncorrelated @xmath14 , the distribution of which matched the experimental data well .",

    "the @xmath15 acceptance and nearly flat detection detection efficiency over all energies and angles made the experiment ideal for cross section measurements .",
    "for further details , see @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 differential cross section ( fig .  [ fig : diffcrosssec ] ) becomes increasingly forward peaked with energy , suggesting larger t - channel contributions . beyond a beam energy of 1750  mev however , the cross section is flat . at forward angles ,",
    "the cross section drops by a factor of approximately four .",
    "this loss of strength at forward angles is apparent as a cusp - like structure in the total cross section ( fig .",
    "[ fig : totcrosssec ] ) , occuring over the @xmath16 and @xmath17 thresholds .",
    "it is speculated that there is large t - channel @xmath1 exchange in @xmath8 below these energies . above threshold",
    "this no longer contributes , the @xmath1 is instead produced as a free particle .",
    "[ fig : totcrosssec](b ) shows an adjusted kaon - maid fit  @xcite , where t - channel @xmath1 exchange has been `` switched off '' at the cusp - like structure energy , and the s@xmath18(1900 ) couplings have been changed to 0.3 for both g@xmath19 and g@xmath20 , giving a closer match to the data .",
    "further evidence of @xmath1 subthreshold contribution can be seen in fig  [ fig : totcrosssec](a ) , where above threshold , the @xmath21 cross section  @xcite has been added to the @xmath8 cross section .",
    "this is in much better agreement with the existing kaon - maid parameterisation .    just above threshold , @xmath1 couples strongly to a @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",

    "[ fig : feynman](c ) feeds @xmath22 photoproduction below the @xmath1 threshold .",

    "[ fig : feynman](c ) no longer contributes to the @xmath8 cross section .    .",

    "a @xmath1-hyperon dynamically generated resonance occuring near the @xmath1 threshold would yield a @xmath23 of 1/2@xmath24 or 3/2@xmath24 ( assuming the meson and hyperon to be relative s - wave ) .",
    "the polarisation observable , @xmath2 ( longitudinally polarised target , circularly polarised beam ) provides a sensitive filter for the helicity structure of resonance contributions , and large changes of @xmath2 close to the @xmath1 threshold would provide an ideal test for dynamically generated states .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 would be sensitive to large changes in t - channel contributions , as pure t - channel contributions would give zero beam - target asymmetry .",
    "the bgo open dipole ( bgo - od ) experiment is in commision at the elsa facility with first data expected to be taken in 2012 .",
    "bgo - od consists of the bgo ball , a large acceptance calorimeter , designed for multiple photon detection with high energy and time resolution .",
    "forward angles are covered by a magnetic spectrometer with a series of tracking detectors , drift chambers and time of flight walls .",
    "see @xcite for details .    the excellent forward angle acceptance and momentum reconstruction will be ideal for strangeness photoproduction , vector meson photoproduction and recoil polarisation measurements which will be complimentary to the results discussed here .",
