    "the variation of @xmath8 along the @xmath13 axis reminds us of the old problem , much discussed in the 1970 s and 1980 s , of the structure change from the @xmath14 to @xmath15 ge isotope .",
    "references were listed , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite published in 1987 .",
    "a notable irregularity at @xmath0 was observed in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 reaction cross sections @xcite , which is characterized by a drastic drop of the second @xmath2 excitation energy in @xmath18ge .",
    "this is an unusually low excited @xmath2 state , showing a similar character as that of typical doubly - closed - shell nuclei . at @xmath0 ,",
    "the drop of @xmath19 appears in coincidence with a remarkable enhancement of @xmath8 .",
    "these experimental data suggest that the structure of @xmath18ge with @xmath0 is very different from that of @xmath11ni studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the structure changes in ge isotopes were discussed in terms of pairing correlation and shape change ( or shape coexistence ) by using various collective models @xcite .",
    "the interacting boson model @xcite reproduced the observed energy levels and @xmath5 values for @xmath20ge .",
    "however , a satisfactory microscopic explanation has not been seen .",
    "most of the early studies in the literature limited their discussion on the configuration change within the @xmath21 shell .",
    "contributions from the @xmath1 orbit were very little mentioned .",
    "these early studies are insufficient according to the new knowledge on the @xmath0 magicity obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , which has emphasized that nucleons in the @xmath1 orbit play a crucial role in determining the structure of the @xmath0 isotones .",
    "thus , as a necessary requirement , a microscopic study for the structure in ge isotopes should include the @xmath1 orbit .",
    "in the previous publications @xcite , we have demonstrated the feasibility of a shell model description for @xmath22ge ( including odd - mass isotopes ) , and for some other neighboring nuclei of the mass region . in these studies , large - scale shell model calculations ( up to dimension @xmath23 ) were performed in the model space @xmath10 , the same model space as that of ref .",
    "the aim of the present article is twofold : to fill the gap in the ge isotopic chain that the previous shell model calculations have neglected , and to look for possible structure reasons that may explain the unsolved puzzle in the middle of the chain around @xmath0 .",
    "the extended pairing plus quadrupole ( @xmath24 ) hamiltonian @xcite is employed in the present work .",
    "this hamiltonian has recently been proposed and tested through several shell model applications .",
    "it should be stressed that this isospin - invariant hamiltonian includes strong proton - neutron interactions in both @xmath25 and @xmath26 channel .",
    "the single - particle energies in our model are @xmath27=0.00 , @xmath28=0.77 , @xmath29=1.11 , and @xmath30=2.50 ( in mev ) . in the present work that deals with a long isotopic chain , we use the @xmath31-dependent interaction strengths : @xmath32 mev for the monopole pairing force , @xmath33 mev for the quadrupole - quadrupole ( @xmath34 ) force , and @xmath35 mev for the octupole - octupole ( @xmath36 ) force .",
    "these are the same parameters as those in ref .",
    "the hamiltonian contains also five monopole correction terms ( see ref .",
    "the effective charges are @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    ,",
    "@xmath39 , and @xmath19 for the ge isotopes from @xmath40 to 50 . calculated @xmath8 with two sets of effective charge are shown for comparison.,width=264,height=264 ]    our results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where calculated @xmath8 , @xmath39 , and @xmath19 for the ge isotopes from @xmath41ge ( @xmath40 ) to @xmath42ge ( @xmath9 ) are compared with data .",
    "the calculation reasonably reproduces @xmath8 and @xmath19 at both ends of the isotopic chain with @xmath13 = 34 , 36 and @xmath13 = 48 , 50 , but fails to describe those in between .",
    "especially , the calculation could not reproduce the increasing trend of @xmath8 over @xmath0 and the drop of @xmath19 around this neutron number .",
    "we can get an improved agreement with the @xmath8 data for @xmath43ge and @xmath44ge ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) if we enlarge the effective charges to @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( @xmath46 is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath45 is fixed so as to reproduce @xmath8 in @xmath42ge ) .",
    "however , the use of larger effective charges destroys the good agreement for @xmath41ge and @xmath11ge already obtained in ref .",
    "moreover , the rise in effective charges does not seem to have any positive effect on enhancing @xmath8 at @xmath0 .",
    "it is thus clear that the problem must stem from deeper structure reasons , which can not be resolved simply by a global fit through effective charges .",
    "the above results indicate an inadequacy either in the interaction employed in the calculation , or in the model space for @xmath47ge in question . at present",
    ", there is no available effective interaction better than the extended @xmath24 interaction for ge isotopes in the model space @xmath10 .",
    "we thus proceed our study with the extended @xmath24 interaction and look for any possible reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath8 in the @xmath0 isotones from @xmath11ni to @xmath44sr has been qualitatively explained by langanke _",
    "_ @xcite using the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) approach , where a @xmath24 hamiltonian ( with no monopole terms ) is used but their model space is larger , which includes also the @xmath4 shell .",
    "it must be noted that the smmc calculation gives only total @xmath5 strength to excited @xmath48 states and does not give the energy of the @xmath49 state .",
    "the smmc calculation predicted a large neutron occupation number in the @xmath1 orbit ( @xmath50 ) , in contrast to our small value ( @xmath51 ) obtained for @xmath18ge .",
    "this gives us a hint that inclusion of the @xmath52 orbits may significantly enhance the role of the @xmath1 orbit through the pairing and quadrupole correlations when the fermi level moves toward the @xmath4 shell .",
    "the deficiency in our calculation may be due to the insufficient model space for the nuclei where neutrons start to occupy the @xmath53 and @xmath1 orbits .    the @xmath1 occupancy of neutrons is investigated in @xmath11ni with the ordinary shell model @xcite , in which the @xmath1 orbit is excluded from the model space for protons .",
    "the value @xmath54 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is considerably different from the smmc result @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "in another recent work @xcite , we have investigated @xmath11ni in the neutron model space @xmath10 assuming a @xmath56ni core .",
    "the shell model for neutrons also gives the value @xmath54 , similar to that in ref .",
    "these shell model calculations show that the ground state of this nucleus remains a transitional character to a superfluid phase .",
    "it is thus interesting to investigate whether the delicate structure changes from the @xmath14 to @xmath15 ge isotopes are caused by strong pairing correlations .",
    "we continue our study within the @xmath57 space as this model space is at present the largest possible for a full shell model diagonalization . within this truncated space",
    ", contributions from the @xmath58 orbits must be expressed in terms of effective interaction .",
    "we have made testing calculations with different monopole corrections , which effectively change the neutron @xmath1 occupation . however , moderate modifications for the monopole corrections can not produce a significant structure change near @xmath59 . on the other hand",
    ", it is expected that the effects of the @xmath58 orbits tend to strengthen the pairing and quadrupole correlations .",
    "we therefore consider to enlarge the quadrupole matrix element @xmath60 to mimic any effect from the missing @xmath58 orbits .",
    "note that the quadrupole matrix elements between the @xmath61 and @xmath62 orbits are nonzero and those between the @xmath21 and @xmath63 shells are zero ( the @xmath64 orbit nearest to @xmath61 has the largest quadrupole matrix element with @xmath61 ) .",
    "based on the above considerations , we write the effective quadrupole matrix element for the @xmath1 orbit by multiplying a factor @xmath65 @xmath66 physically , an @xmath67 factor strengthens the @xmath34 force with respect to the @xmath1 orbit , which is consistent with the expectation that the ge isotopes become deformed at the beginning of the @xmath1 orbit and that a strong @xmath34 force contributes to lowering of the @xmath1 orbit .",
    "a stronger @xmath60 increases also the effective charges selectively for the @xmath1 nucleons . in our shell model treatment , we transform the @xmath34 force into multipole - pairing - type interactions in the particle - particle channel . thus effectively , a stronger @xmath34 force with respect to the @xmath1 orbit enhances also the pairing correlations , which allows more nucleons to jump to the @xmath1 orbit .    , @xmath39 , and @xmath19 in @xmath3ge as @xmath30 approaches @xmath29.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=241 ] , @xmath39 , and @xmath19 in @xmath3ge as @xmath30 approaches @xmath29.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=241 ] , @xmath39 , and @xmath19 in @xmath3ge as @xmath30 approaches @xmath29.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=241 ]    the effects from the @xmath58 orbits are considered to be isotope dependent and should become larger as the fermi level moves up .",
    "thus in our trial calculations , we assume an empirical expression for @xmath65 , @xmath68 . with these considerations ,",
    "the calculations indeed achieve a great improvement in excitation energies @xmath39 and @xmath19 , especially for @xmath69ge .",
    "the calculated @xmath8 values remain good at the beginning of the chain ( @xmath13 = 34 and 36 , because the configurations are almost exhausted by the @xmath21 shell ) , and are enhanced at the end with @xmath13 = 46 @xmath70 50 .",
    "these improvements support the use of effective quadrupole matrix element @xmath71 .",
    "however , @xmath8 for @xmath72ge are again not enhanced .",
    "this indicates that the microscopic content in the wave - functions has not been improved . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the neutron and proton occupation numbers @xmath73 and @xmath74 obtained for @xmath18ge ( @xmath0 ) by using @xmath71 can not bear a comparison with the large values @xmath75 and @xmath76 reported in ref .",
    "the large @xmath8 value in @xmath18ge corresponds to a large occupation of the @xmath1 orbit , which must be due to the pairing correlations in addition to the @xmath34 force .",
    "in fact , the unusually low energy of the second @xmath2 state in @xmath18ge implies a delicate balance between the pairing correlations and the energy gap @xmath77 .",
    "it has been pointed out by schiffer _",
    "_ @xcite and utsuno _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that the  effective energy \" of the intruder states changes rapidly around a closed subshell in neutron - rich nuclei , and these changes were discussed in terms of the spin - orbit interaction or the spin - isospin dependence of nucleon - nucleon interaction . in our case , the change of the effective energy gap @xmath77 could be attributed to the pairing correlations in the @xmath4 shell .",
    "a good effective hamiltonian in a full shell model should be able to describe the balance microscopically . in the present work with the truncated model space",
    ", we try to understand the problem by simulating the underlying physics .",
    "namely , we adjust the energy gap @xmath78 and study any resultant change in @xmath8 and @xmath19 .",
    "we study variations of @xmath8 and @xmath19 in @xmath69ge as a function of single - particle separation energy between the @xmath1 and @xmath53 orbits . in the calculation",
    ", we use the enhancement factor @xmath79 for @xmath80ge , and a slightly larger one @xmath81 for @xmath82ge .",
    "interesting results are obtained as shown in fig .",
    "the circled areas represent the best choices in parameter that can describe the observed @xmath8 , and at the same time , give correct sequences of @xmath83 and @xmath49 in @xmath84ge .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] indicates clearly the necessity of a rapid lowering of the single - particle energy @xmath30 from the original value 2.5 mev in @xmath85ge , to @xmath86 2.0 mev in @xmath43ge , to @xmath86 1.75 mev in @xmath18ge , and to @xmath86 1.5 mev in @xmath82ge .",
    "thus the calculation demonstrates that the observed enhancement in @xmath8 and variation in @xmath19 correlate closely with the single - particle energy separation .",
    "data can not be understood unless the effective energy gap @xmath78 near @xmath0 is set to be small . on the other hand , the calculated @xmath8 in @xmath18ge and @xmath82ge",
    "can not reach the observed large values unless the enlarged matrix element @xmath71 is used .",
    "in particular , the correct sequence of the @xmath49 and @xmath83 states in @xmath82ge can not be obtained without narrowing the effective gap @xmath77 to a sensitive region in the parameter space , which implies an extremely delicate balance between the pairing correlations and the energy separation @xmath77 .    , @xmath39 , and @xmath19 in @xmath87ge as @xmath30 approaches @xmath29.,width=264,height=241 ]    although a meaningful parameter choice can be found for the isotopes up to @xmath82ge , it is difficult to go beyond them and find good parameters that can simultaneously reproduce @xmath8 and @xmath19 for @xmath87ge , as illustrated in fig .",
    "this indicates limitations in our renormalization approach within the truncated model space missing @xmath58 orbits above @xmath1 . as we shall see in sect .",
    "iv , a small energy separation @xmath88 causes nucleons to jump to the @xmath1 orbit easily , and with more nucleons in the @xmath1 orbit the use of @xmath71 enhances @xmath5 values in @xmath84ge",
    ". however , the situation seems to be different between @xmath84ge and @xmath87ge . in @xmath84ge ,",
    "the @xmath1 orbit is occupied by at most four neutrons . in @xmath87ge , however , about half of the neutron @xmath1 orbit is occupied . with an additional neutron pair in the @xmath1 orbit",
    ", @xmath71 enhances @xmath5 exaggeratedly .",
    "in such a case , our renormalization approach fails to work properly .",
    "it would be necessary for the description of the @xmath89 isotopes to explicitly include upper orbits such as @xmath90 , as suggested in ref .",
    "below , we continue our discussion but focus the attention on the structure change in @xmath43ge , @xmath18ge , and @xmath82ge only .    , @xmath39 , and @xmath19 with experimental data.,width=264,height=264 ]    with the above adjustment in @xmath77 and the use of effective quadrupole matrix element @xmath71 , we are able to reproduce correctly all the observed variations in @xmath8 , @xmath19 , and @xmath39 for @xmath69ge , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . here",
    ", the energy separation @xmath78 is not required to change for the @xmath41ge and @xmath11ge calculations if @xmath71 with @xmath91 is used .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows that the variation trend of @xmath92 energy is also correctly reproduced .",
    "of course , our simulated calculation does not provide a final answer to the problem , but is quite suggestive .",
    "it should be stressed that the set of circles in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is the sole selection in parameter that can describe the experimental data .",
    "the important information extracted from the above discussions is that in order to describe all the observed quantities in ge isotopes , it is necessary to have enough @xmath1 contributions in the wave - functions . next , let us study how the @xmath1 proton and neutron occupations correlate with the observations and how they vary in @xmath3ge .",
    "we calculate occupation numbers @xmath93 for protons and neutrons as functions of the energy separation @xmath78 , and focus our discussion on the results in the circled area that have reproduced data .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows that in @xmath43ge , a considerable number of neutrons occupy the @xmath1 orbit ( @xmath94 ) while protons are scarcely found in this orbit . for the ground state of @xmath18ge ,",
    "the occupation numbers become @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "these occupation numbers are consistent with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , though our value @xmath97 is larger .",
    "the result indicates a superfluid state for neutrons in @xmath18ge , in contrast to the narrow subshell closure in @xmath11ni @xcite .",
    "it is notable that in the circled area for @xmath18ge , the coupling between the @xmath98 and @xmath49 states becomes significant and a considerable number of protons occupy the @xmath1 orbit , which shows a qualitative difference from the structure in @xmath43ge .",
    "the structure in @xmath82ge again differs qualitatively from @xmath18ge .",
    "as @xmath30 approaches @xmath29 , the proton occupation numbers @xmath99 for @xmath98 and @xmath49 are reversed . for @xmath100 mev",
    "with which the calculated @xmath8 are comparable with data , more than four neutrons occupy the @xmath1 orbit and protons occupy this orbit also considerably , in sharp contrast to the situation in @xmath43ge .     and @xmath101 in @xmath3ge as @xmath30 approaches @xmath29.,title=\"fig:\",width=160,height=188 ]   and @xmath101 in @xmath3ge as @xmath30 approaches @xmath29.,title=\"fig:\",width=160,height=188 ]   and @xmath101 in @xmath3ge as @xmath30 approaches @xmath29.,title=\"fig:\",width=160,height=188 ]    thus the structure differences appearing in our calculation for the two lowest @xmath2 states , @xmath98 and @xmath49 , may offer a new explanation for the old problem observed in @xmath16 and @xmath17 reactions .",
    "our simulated calculation predicts that the proton structure in the @xmath1 orbit is very different among the states in @xmath3ge .",
    "the proton @xmath1 occupation changes from a negligible amount in @xmath43ge to a considerable amount in @xmath102ge , and in addition , with a different distribution in the @xmath98 and @xmath49 states .",
    "obviously , these results can not be obtained without the presence of strong proton - neutron correlations in the model , which are important for nuclei where protons and neutrons occupy the same shell .",
    "the energy difference @xmath103 mev used in our calculation , which is adopted so as to well describe @xmath85ge @xcite and also consistent with the value used in ref .",
    "@xcite , is rather small .",
    "still , for the isotopes up to @xmath43ge , the proton occupation number @xmath99 remains small , in contrast to the strong configuration mixing within the @xmath21 shell including the @xmath53 orbit . in this sense , for protons when @xmath104 , there exists a gap between the @xmath105 shell and @xmath1 .",
    "however , as clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the proton occupation number @xmath99 , together with the neutron occupation number @xmath101 , increases suddenly in @xmath18ge and @xmath82ge .",
    "resonance \" effect of @xmath99 and @xmath106 can be best attributed to strong proton - neutron correlations .",
    "similar effects are obtained in the smmc calculations for the @xmath0 isotones @xcite , where a larger energy difference @xmath107 ( or 1.97 ) mev is used but upper @xmath58 orbits above @xmath1 are included in the model space .",
    "a considerably large number of @xmath99 starts from @xmath18ge ( where @xmath108 is only equal to 32 and @xmath13 takes the magic number 40 ) .",
    "we may thus conclude that the proton @xmath1 occupancy must be caused by the proton - neutron correlations in the @xmath63 shell . our treatment with small @xmath78 and large @xmath60",
    "is considered to mimic the effects , since the mechanism is not properly included in the model .",
    "it should be noted in this regard that our isospin - invariant hamiltonian treats dynamically the strong proton - neutron interactions .",
    "in conclusion , inspired by the recent experimental advances in @xmath5 measurement for neutron - rich ge isotopes , we have carried out a systematical shell model calculation for @xmath109ge in the model space @xmath10 .",
    "the calculations have shown that the strong enhancement of @xmath8 and the unusually low excitation of the second @xmath2 state near @xmath0 can be explained only with sufficient occupation of protons and neutrons in the @xmath1 orbit .",
    "the simulated calculations that mimic such effects have suggested a possible understanding of the structure change from @xmath43ge to @xmath82ge in terms of rapid increase in the number of @xmath1 protons and neutrons .",
    "this could be the source for the long - standing problem that has not yet been understood .",
    "the isotopic dependence of the @xmath1 proton occupation must have an origin of strong proton - neutron interactions .    in principle , it is a very difficult question whether all these effects can be expressed in an effective interaction .",
    "the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the @xmath90 orbit above the @xmath1 makes a considerable contribution when @xmath110 in cr and fe isotopes apart from the proton magic number @xmath111 .",
    "the smmc calculations in the @xmath112 space @xcite also suggested an important role of the @xmath90 orbit in the enhancement of @xmath1 occupancies in those nuclei that have sufficient number of protons in the upper @xmath113 shell . according to the extended @xmath24 model",
    ", we can suggest that the pairing and quadrupole - quadrupole correlations in the major shell @xmath4 make it easier for protons and neutrons to be excited from the @xmath113 shell to the @xmath1 orbit . the present investigation with enlarged @xmath60 and decreased energy gap @xmath78 is along the line of this thought .",
