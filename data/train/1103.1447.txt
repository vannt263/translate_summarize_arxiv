    "therefore , this system is likely to be the simplest chaotic system bridging the gap between the lorenz and the chen systems .",
    "the above three systems share some common properties such as : they all have the same symmetry , dissipativity , stability of equilibria , similar bifurcations and topological structures and belong to the generalized lorenz canonical family @xcite .    in the mentioned references , a positive answer to the question as if it is possible to realize a continuous transition from one to another system is given .    in this letter , we present a discontinuous transition algorithm between the lorenz and the chen systems with whitch the l attractor can be synthesized . for this purpose , the parameter switching method introduced in @xcite",
    "is utilized .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : section 2 presents the synthesis algorithm , while in section 3 the l attractor is synthesized in both deterministic and random ways via the mentioned synthesis algorithm .",
    "consider a class of dissipative autonomous dynamical systems modeled by the following initial value problem : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 has the expression @xmath8    with @xmath9being a vector continuous nonlinear function , @xmath10a real constant @xmath11 matrix,@xmath12 , and the maximal existence interval@xmath13    for the l system ( [ unified ] ) , one has : @xmath14{ccc}% 0 & 25 & 0\\\\ -35 & 29 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & -1/3 \\end{array } \\right )   , ~g(x)=\\left (   10\\left (   x_{2}-x_{1}\\right )   , ~x_{2}-x_{1 } x_{3}+28x_{1},x_{1}x_{2}-8/3x_{3}\\right )   ^{t}\\ ] ]    with divergence @xmath15 for@xmath16,$ ] so the system is dissipative .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of solutions on the maximal existence interval @xmath17are assumed .",
    "also , without any restriction , it is supposed that corresponding to different @xmath18 , there are different global attractors . because of numerical characteristics of the attractors synthesis ( as ) algorithm and for sake of simplicity , by a _ ( global ) attractor _ in this letter one understand without a significant loss of generality , only the approximation of the @xmath19-_limit set _ , as in @xcite , is plotted after neglecting a sufficiently long period of transients ( for background about attractors see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath20 be the set of all admissible values for @xmath18 and @xmath21 the set of all corresponding global attractors , which includes attractive stable fixed points , limit cycles and chaotic attractors",
    ". also , denote by @xmath22 a finite subset of @xmath23 for some positive integer @xmath24 and the corresponding subset of attractors @xmath25    because of the assumed dissipativity , @xmath21 is a non - empty set .",
    "therefore , following the above assumptions , a bijection between @xmath23 and @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 can be considered .",
    "thus , to each @xmath29 corresponds a unique global attractor @xmath30 and conversely for each global attractor there exists a unique parameter value @xmath29 .    in @xcite , it is proved numerically that switching , indefinitely in some periodic way , the parameter @xmath18 inside @xmath22 over finite time subintervals , while ( [ ivp general ] ) is integrated with some numerical method for odes with fixed step size @xmath31 , any attractor of @xmath32 can be synthesized .",
    "for a chosen @xmath33 , consider @xmath34 being partitioned in to consecutive sets of @xmath35finite adjacent time subintervals @xmath36 , : @xmath37 of lengths @xmath38 .",
    "if , in each subinterval @xmath39 while some numerical method with single fixed step size @xmath31 integrates ( [ ivp general ] ) , @xmath18 is switched as follows : @xmath40for @xmath41 then , a _ synthesized attractor _ , denoted by @xmath42 can be generated@xmath43 the simplest way to implement numerically the as algorithm is to choose @xmath44 as a multiple of @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the as algorithm can be symbolically written for a fixed step size @xmath31 as follows : @xmath45 , \\label{sa}\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 are some positive integers ( weights ) and by @xmath47 one understands that in the @xmath48-th time subinterval @xmath49of length @xmath50 @xmath51receives the value @xmath52    in @xcite , it is proved numerically that @xmath53 is _ _ identical _ _ to @xmath54 for    @xmath55    for example , the sequence @xmath56   $ ] means that @xmath57 @xmath58 and the synthesized attractor @xmath59is synthesized as follows : in the first time interval @xmath60of length @xmath61 the numerical method solves ( [ ivp general ] ) with @xmath62 next , for the second time interval @xmath63 of length @xmath64 , @xmath65 and the algorithm repeats . if we apply this scheme to ( [ unified ] ) for @xmath66 ( chaotic l attractor ) and @xmath67 ( chaotic chen attractor ) , one obtains the synthesized regular chen attractor @xmath53 which is identical to @xmath68with @xmath69 in ( [ p formula ] ) , corresponding to a stable periodic limit cycle . in fig . 1 , to underline the identity , phase plots , time series , histograms and poincar sections superimposed",
    "were utilized beside haussdorf distance between the two attractors which is of order @xmath70conferring a good accuracy to as .",
    "it is noted that the as algorithm can be applied even in some random way : because @xmath71 in ( [ p formula ] ) is defined in a convex manner ( if denoting @xmath72",
    "then@xmath73 with@xmath74 and based on the bijective function @xmath75 , any synthesized attractor @xmath53 is located inside the set @xmath32 ( all elements , i.e. attractors , are ordered with the order endowed by @xmath76and whatever ( random ) scheme ( [ sa ] ) is used , the result is the same @xcite .    the random as can be implemented e.g. by generating a sequence ( [ sa ] ) with a random uniform distribution of @xmath18 @xcite which",
    "is supposed to generate all the integers @xmath77(fig .",
    "2)@xmath78    now , @xmath79 is given by the following formula : @xmath80    where @xmath81 counts the number of @xmath82 .",
    "obviously , now , @xmath34 has to be chosen large enough , such that ( [ p random ] ) can converge to @xmath79 ( the precise value in this case for @xmath79 could be obtained only for @xmath83 ) .",
    "\\i ) the as algorithm is useful in the applications where some @xmath18 are not directly accessible.ii ) the as algorithm can be viewed as an explanation for the way regular or chaotic behaviors may appear in natural systems .",
    "ii ) being a numerical algorithm , as has limitations .",
    "for example , for relatively large switches of @xmath18 or @xmath84 or for a too - large number @xmath85 @xmath53 could present some `` corners '' . also , obviously , the @xmath31 size may influence the as algorithm performances ( ideally , @xmath86 should decrease to zero ) . some details and other related aspects about the errors",
    "can be found in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "iii ) in the general case of a dynamical system modeled by ( [ ivp general ] ) , the only restriction to synthesize a chaotic attractor , when starting from regular attractors , is that inside the set @xmath32 there are chaotic attractors ( and vice - versa for regular synthesized attractors).iv ) the as can be used as a kind of control - like method @xcite or anticontrol @xcite.v ) near several continuous dynamical systems ( such as the chen system , rssler system , rabinovich - fabrikant system ( @xcite ) minimal networks , lotka - volterra system , l system , rikitake system ) , the as algorithm was also applied successfully to systems of fractional orders @xcite .",
    "the numerical results in this section are obtained using the standard runge - kutta algorithm with fixed integration time step @xmath87 .    to visualize how the as works , the bifurcation diagram was plotted ( fig .",
    "next , we synthesize the l attractor starting from different values for @xmath18 and using deterministic or random schemes ( [ p formula ] ) . in this simulation , once we fixed @xmath85 all we need is to choose @xmath88 and @xmath89so that the equation ( [ p formula ] ) with @xmath90 corresponding to the l attractor , can be verified .",
    "besides poincar sections and histograms , haussdorf distance between @xmath59and @xmath54 ( @xcite p.114 ) was computed , in this case , in order of @xmath91 which indicates a good approximation .",
    "first we applied the deterministic scheme ( [ sa ] ) for @xmath92 @xmath93 ( corresponding to generalized the lorenz system , fig .",

    ", the synthesized attractor @xmath53 is identical to @xmath54 with @xmath97 ( fig . 4 c ) .",
    "in fig . 4 d and e , the histograms and poincar sections of both attractors , @xmath53 and @xmath98are plotted superimposed to underline the identity .",
    "because the solution of ( [ p formula ] ) for given @xmath99 is not unique , the l attractor can be obtained in , theoretically , infinitely many ways .",
    "thus , we chose @xmath100 , @xmath101(corresponding to the lorenz system)@xmath102 @xmath103 ( corresponding to the chen system )  and @xmath104 @xmath105 again @xmath106 @xmath107 and @xmath42 @xmath54 are presented in fig . 5 with poincar sections and histograms .",

    "2 , the l attractor can be synthesized with , for example , @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( fig . 6 )",
    "the design as algorithm has been utilized to generate numerically the l attractor starting from his `` neighbors '' , the lorenz and chen attractors , not by continuous transformations as before but by discontinuous parameter switching inside a chosen parameter set .                              obtained using the scheme",
