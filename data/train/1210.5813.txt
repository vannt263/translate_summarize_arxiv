    "with the rapid development of wireless communication technology , various kinds of traditional data service , such as media streaming , cell broadcasting and mobile tv , have been implemented in wireless networks nowadays . as a result , wireless multicasting becomes a central feature of the next generation cellular networks .",
    "physical layer multicasting with beamforming is a promising solution enabled by exploiting channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter over the traditional isotropic broadcasting .",
    "the problem of multicast beamforming for quality - of - service ( qos ) guarantee and for max - min fairness was firstly considered in @xcite .",
    "the similar problem of multicasting to multiple cochannel groups was then investigated in @xcite .",
    "the core problem of multicast beamforming is essentially np - hard @xcite .",
    "some other issues such as outage analysis and capacity limits were studied in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so far multicast beamforming has been included in the umts - lte / embms draft for next - generation cellular wireless services @xcite , @xcite .    in conventional wireless systems ,",
    "signal processing is performed on a per - cell basis .",
    "the intercell interference is treated as background noise and minimized by applying a predesigned frequency reuse pattern such that the adjacent cells use different frequency bands . due to the fast growing demand for high - rate wireless multimedia applications , many beyond-3 g wireless technologies such as 3gpp - lte and",
    "wimax have relaxed the constraint on the frequency reuse such that the total frequency band is available for reuse by all cells in the same cluster . however",
    ", this will cause the whole system limited by the intercell interference .",
    "consequently , cooperative signal processing across the different base stations has been identified as a key technique to mitigate intercell interference in the next - generation wireless systems .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate multicast beamforming for cooperative multicell networks .",
    "the base stations cooperate with each other and design their transmit beamformers in a coordinated manner . in general , there are two cooperation scenarios in multicell networks . in the first scenario ,",
    "different base stations are fully cooperative and act as  networked mimo ( multiple - input multiple - output ) \" ( e.g. , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "namely , they coordinate in the signal level , i.e. , data information intended for different users in different cells is shared among the base stations .",
    "clearly , networked mimo needs tremendous amount of information exchange overhead .",
    "in contrast , in the second scenario , the base stations are only required to coordinate at the beamforming level which needs rather small information sharing ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper , we focus on the latter case by only allowing beamforming level coordination .",
    "we first formulate the problem of multicell multicast beamforming as sum power minimization subject to the constraint that the received signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) of each user is above a threshold .",
    "this problem is referred to as qos problem .",
    "it is known that the qos problem in single - cell scenario is always feasible . however ,",
    "this is not so in multicell networks due to the intercell interference , especially when the channel condition is bad or the sinr target is very stringent .",
    "we first present a necessary condition on the optimization problem to be feasible .",
    "then we propose a novel distributed algorithm to solve the multicell multicast cooperative beamforming design .",
    "more specifically , based on the decomposition theory @xcite , we introduce a set of interference constraint parameters and decompose the original problem into several parallel sub - problems . since the sub - problems are nonconvex and np - hard , each base station then applies the semidefinite relaxation and independently solves its own sub - problem .",
    "the interference parameters are updated based on a master problem .",
    "simulation results show that the algorithm converges in only several iterations .    in view of the user fairness issue",
    ", we also consider the multicell multiast beamforming design with the goal of maximizing the minimum sinr ( mms ) among all users under individual power constraints .",
    "this is called mms problem . by linking the mms problem with a weighted peak power minimization ( wppm ) problem",
    ", we propose an efficient algorithm to find the near - optimal solution .",
    "previously , the authors in @xcite @xcite also studied the multicell multicast beamforming problem with the objective to maximize the minimum sinr but subject to a total sum power constraint across all base stations .",
    "hence , the problem considered in @xcite @xcite is very similar to the multicast beamforming problem in single - cell multi - group systems as in @xcite .",
    "authors in @xcite also considered the similar problem under per - base - station power constraint but allowed data sharing among base stations , which is similar to the  network mimo \" and requires a large amount of information exchange overhead .",
    "thus , our beamforming design for max - min fairness is more practical as we consider individual peak power constraint on each base station and only allow coordination in the beamforming level .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model for multicell multicasting is presented .",
    "section iii considers the beamformer design in the qos problem and develops a novel decentralized coordinated beamforming algorithm . in section iv",

    "we define the complex scalar @xmath25 as the multicast information symbol for the users in the @xmath7th cell .",
    "the discrete - time baseband signal received by the @xmath22th user in the @xmath7th cell is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the additive white circularly symmetric gaussian complex noise with variance @xmath28 on each of its real and imaginary components . in ( 1 ) , the second term is the intercell interference .    based on the received signal model in ( 1 ) , the performance of each user can be characterized by the output sinr , defined as @xmath29 notice that each user in the considered multicell multicast network only suffers from the intercell interference , which is different from multicell unicast systems where both inter - cell interference and intra - cell interference exist .    in practical scenarios , the channels from a base station to different users , which may or may not belong to a same cell , can be correlated , especially when these users are in close proximity to each other . for the users belonging to the same cell , we call the correlation between @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 as the intracell - user channel correlation . for the users from different cells , we call the correlation between @xmath30 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 as the intercell - user channel correlation .",
    "the coordinated qos beamforming design is to minimize the total energy consumption of the system while maintaining a target sinr for all users by properly designing the beamformers at each base station .",
    "this is formulated as :    @xmath35    where @xmath36^t$ ] is the target sinr vector with each element @xmath37 being the target sinr value to be achieved by the users in the @xmath7th cell .",
    "since the base station transmits a common information in a multicast manner , the information rate for the users within one cell is the same , and hence we set a common sinr target for all the users in the same cell .      due to the sinr constraints , the qos problem in is not always feasible , which is similar to the multiuser unicast scenario @xcite . in order to verify its feasibility , we need to show whether there exists a set of beamformers @xmath38 for a given @xmath39 such that @xmath40 for simplicity , the sinr targets for different cells are assumed to be the same . then the above condition boils down to the following @xmath41 for the @xmath22th user in each cell , we combine their channel vectors as follows @xmath42 where each @xmath43 is an @xmath44 matrix .",
    "the following lemma provides a necessary condition for the qos problem to be feasible .    * lemma 1 * : given the sinr target vector @xmath45 , if the problem is feasible , then the sinr target @xmath46 should satisfy the following condition @xmath47    please refer to appendix a.    from lemma 1",
    ", we can see that the intercell - user channel correlation has a negative impact on its feasibility . more specifically , if some of the rows in @xmath43 , say the @xmath7th row and @xmath48th row for @xmath49 , are correlated , which means that the channels between the @xmath22th user in the @xmath7th cell and the @xmath22th user in the @xmath48th cell are correlated , then the rank of @xmath43 could be less than @xmath17 and as a result , the sinr threshold @xmath46 will have a finite upper bound . on the other hand , if the channels of users in different cells are independent , we have that the matrix @xmath50 is full rank with probability one , then the corresponding upper bound is infinite , which means no constraint on @xmath46 .",
    "since the problem is np - hard @xcite , determining its feasibility is not an easy job .",
    "the lemma gives a necessary condition from the perspective of channel correlation . in the following ,",
    "we only consider the problem when it is feasible .",
    "a desired feature of coordinated beamforming in multicell networks is that the base station at each cell can implement its beamforming design locally @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is due to the constraint in practical systems that the backhaul channel has limited capacity . in this subsection",
    ", we propose a decentralized scheme for implementing the multicell multicast qos beamforming .",
    "it is assumed that each base station in the network only has the channel knowledge of the mobile users within its own cell .    the distributed algorithm to problem",
    "@xmath51 can not be easily obtained primarily because all the beamformers are coupled together in the constraint . according to the decomposition theory @xcite and inspired by @xcite",

    "we can not solve it by exploiting its dual problem since the strong duality does not hold . in the following",
    "we take the semidefinite relaxation ( sdr ) approach , the optimality of which shall be discussed later in this section . introducing new variables",

    "the sum signaling overhead among the base stations in one iteration is thus @xmath110 .",
