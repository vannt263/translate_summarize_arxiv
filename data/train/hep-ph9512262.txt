    "as early as in 1970s , it was observed @xcite that inclusive cross sections for single high transverse momentum particle produced in hadron - nucleus scattering show an `` anomalous '' nuclear dependence , in which the cross section at fixed transverse momentum grows approximately as @xmath0 with @xmath2 as the atomic number of the nuclear target .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is a function of transverse momentum , and can be as large as @xmath3 . this phenomenon has been known as cronin effect .",
    "typical energy exchange in a high transverse - momentum scattering process is so large that any single hard scattering should be very localized within a single nucleon .",
    "consequently , a linear @xmath2 dependence is expected for single scattering processes .",
    "therefore , the cronin effect is often described as due to multiple scattering of partons in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 behavior signals a dependence on nuclear size , and multiple scattering is dominated by double scattering .",
    "in some of the previous work on this topic , an independent scattering picture was adopted @xcite . in this picture , each scattering was treated independently .",
    "for example , the cross section for double scattering was proportional to a product of two born cross sections .",
    "the double scattering cross section in this picture is not infrared safe however .",
    "this is because the kinematics of single particle inclusive cross section can only provide a constraint on the total momentum from the target , which leaves the possibility that one of the born cross section diverges when the momentum transfer of this born cross section approaches to zero .",
    "therefore , theoretical predictions from the independent scattering picture are sensitive to the infrared cutoffs which must be introduced in the calculations .",
    "recently , luo , qiu and sterman ( lqs ) have shown that the anomalous nuclear enhancement can be described naturally in perturbative qcd , in terms of a nonleading power , or `` higher twist '' formalism @xcite . in this",
    "treatment , contribution from double scattering can be factorized into short - distance hard parts convoluted with corresponding multi - parton matrix elements , or multiparton correlation functions in nuclei .",
    "the short - distance partonic parts are calculable in perturbative qcd , and all infrared divergences associated with soft rescatterings in perturbation theory can systematically be absorbed into multiparton correlation functions .",
    "the multiparton correlation functions are nonperturbative , just like the parton distributions in the single scattering processes .",
    "these correlation functions in nuclei provide information about nuclear matter and its interaction with high energy probes .",
    "they can reveal information different from what normal parton distributions in nuclei can provide ; and in principle , they are as fundamental as the parton distributions . in order to test the theory",
    ", we need to find different processes which depend on the same multiparton correlation functions .",
    "information on these new correlation functions extracted from one set of processes may be applied in other processes .",
    "our aim in this paper is to show that the consistent perturbative qcd treatment of double scattering developed by lqs can be naturally applied to high transverse momentum direct photon production in hadron - nucleus scattering .",
    "we factorize the cross section of direct photon production into calculable short - distance partonic parts times multiparton correlation functions , which are the same as those derived in ref .",
    "we calculated the short - distance partonic hard parts .",
    "we evaluate the nuclear dependence by using the information on the multiparton correlation functions , extracted from experiments on momentum imbalance of two - jet photoproduction on nuclear targets @xcite .",
    "our numerical results are consistent with recent measurement of nuclear dependence in direct photon production from fermilab e706 experiment @xcite",
    ".    a double scattering with high momentum transfer must have at least one hard scattering to produce the high transverse momentum observables .",
    "in addition , there may be a soft scattering either before or after the hard scattering ( referred to below as a soft - hard process ) , or another hard scattering ( called as a double hard process ) .",
    "we shall show that only the soft - hard processes contribute to the nuclear dependence of direct photon production to the order we consider .",
    "the fact that the photon does not interact strongly once produced at the hard collisions eliminates final - state multiple scattering in direct photon cross sections .",
    "therefore , direct photon production in hadron - nucleus scattering provides an excellent test of initial state multiple scatterings , while jet or single particle production in photon - nucleus scattering provide independent tests of final state multiple scatterings .",
    "jet and single particle production in hadron - nucleus collisions , on the other hand , receive contributions from both initial and final state multiple scatterings .",
    "final state multiple scattering in photoproduction has been discussed in ref .",
    "our work will provide the complimentary information on the initial state multiple scattering .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] with an outline of the formalism used in our calculation .",

    "we conclude with a brief summary , and suggestions for further work .",
    "an energetic photon can be directly produced at short - distance in high energy collisions , and does not interact strongly once produced .",
    "therefore , it has been recognized for a long time that direct photon production is a clean probe for short - distance dynamics in high energy collisions @xcite .",
    "data from hadronic prompt photon production plays a very important role in qcd global analysis , and provides constraints on gluon distributions in hadrons @xcite . in this section , we outline the general formulas for cross sections of direct photon production , and present our analytical results for the contribution from double scattering processes .      in the following discussion ,",
    "we study direct photon production in hadron - nucleus collisions , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is defined as the averaged momentum per nucleon . in general",
    ", the total cross section for the above process can be expressed as a sum of contributions from single scattering , double scattering and even higher multiple scattering , @xmath7 where the superscripts @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the single and double scattering , respectively , and `` ... '' represents other possible multiple scatterings . in this paper",
    ", we consider only the double scattering , and its contribution to nuclear dependence .    as a result of perturbative factorization @xcite",
    ", the single scattering cross section can be expressed as @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , @xmath11 is a normal parton distributions in the beam hadron @xmath12 , @xmath13 is an effective nucleon parton distributions inside a nucleus , which should include the well - known emc effect . in principle , the parton - parton scattering cross section , @xmath14 , should include both direct and fragmentation contributions . that is , an energetic photon can be produced directly at short - distances , or produced from the fragmentation of an energetic parton which was produced at short - distances @xcite .",
    "for example , the partonic scattering may produce an energetic quark , which radiates a photon .",
    "since we are most interested in fixed target experiments here , the fragmentation contribution is much smaller than the direct contribution in most of phase space @xcite .",

    "the positivity of a cross section requires the sum of all possible multiple scattering contribution to be positive .",
    "the separation between single and double scattering is not unique .",
    "for example , two scatterings can be very close to each other , and localized in one nucleon , and such a double scattering will not provide the anomalous nuclear dependence , and may be classified as a single scattering .",

    "( [ e13 ] ) , the lack of oscillation factors for both @xmath151 and @xmath152 integrals can in principle give nuclear enhancement proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath84 dependence is a result of the assumption that the positions of two field strengths ( at @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively ) are confined within one nucleon .    in eq .",
    "( [ e42 ] ) , the effective nuclear parton distributions @xmath145 should have the same operator definitions of the normal parton distributions with free nucleon states replaced by the nuclear states . for a nucleus with @xmath153 protons and atomic number @xmath2 , we define @xmath154 where @xmath155 and @xmath156 with @xmath157 are normal parton distributions in a free neutron and proton , respectively ; and @xmath158 .",
    "the factor @xmath159 takes care of the emc effect in these effective nuclear parton distributions .",
    "we adopted the @xmath160 from ref .",

    "( [ e8 ] ) and ( [ e11 ] ) , we can derive the nuclear dependence parameter @xmath27 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) , any further free parameter .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we compare our numerical predictions for the nuclear dependence parameter with the recent experimental data from fermilab experiment e706 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath162 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] is slightly different from that defined in eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) . e706",
    "measured the direct photon cross sections with the @xmath163 beam on two different targets : cu(@xmath164 ) and be(@xmath165 ) ; and the @xmath162 was extracted according to following definition @xmath166 the beam energy is @xmath167 gev .",
    "it is clear that the theoretical calculation presented in this work is consistent with the data .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] that the nuclear dependence parameter @xmath162 is very close to the unity , or equivalently , the cronin effect for direct photon production is very small , and much smaller than that observed in the single particle inclusive cross sections @xcite .",
    "one clear difference between the direct photon and the single particle inclusive cross sections is that direct photon production has only initial state multiple scattering , while the single particle inclusive has both initial and final state multiple scattering .",
    "in addition , the single particle inclusive cross sections depend on the parton - to - hadron fragmentation functions .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the multiple scattering contribution is most important when the momentum fraction @xmath23 from the nuclear correlation functions is large because of the derivatives with respective to the @xmath23 , which were introduced in eq .",
    "( [ e12 ] ) .",
    "however , for direct photon production , the kinematics do not fix all parton momentum fractions , and leave one momentum fraction to be integrated , for example , @xmath168 in eqs .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) and ( [ e11 ] ) .",
    "because of the steeply falling nature of the distributions and correlation functions , the cross sections in the central region ( @xmath169 ) for a given value of @xmath170 is dominated by the distributions with momentum fractions @xmath171 , which is less than 0.6 even for the largest value of @xmath170 shown in fig .",
    "therefore , the double scattering contribution is relatively small because the derivative terms are not significantly enhanced , and consequently , @xmath162 is close to one .",
    "in contrast , for inclusive single hadron production , the parton - to - hadron fragmentation functions effectively shift the contribution at a given @xmath170 to the large @xmath23 region because of all fragmentation functions vanish when @xmath172 goes to 1 .",
    "kinematically , direct photon production corresponds to single particle production at @xmath173 .",
    "we , therefore , expect that single hadron production has a larger cronin effect than the direct photon production at the exact same kinematics , even before including contributions of final state multiple scattering .    in the case of a pion beam ,",
    "the quark - antiquark `` annihilation '' subprocess , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , dominates the production of direct photons at the fixed target energy , due to the valence antiquarks in the beam .",
    "however , for a proton beam , the quark - gluon `` compton '' subprocess , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , is more important for the production of direct photons .",
    "therefore , direct photon production with a proton beam is more sensitive to the proton gluon distributions . in figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] , and [ fig9 ] , we present our predictions of nuclear dependence parameter @xmath27 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) , for a @xmath163 and proton beam , respectively .    in figs .",
    "[ fig8]a and [ fig9]a , the nuclear dependence parameter @xmath27 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) , is plotted as a function of photon s transverse momentum @xmath170 at @xmath174 . in plotting these figures ,",
    "a 515 gev beam energy and a copper target was assumed , using the same parton distributions and correlation functions as in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . as expected , and as found in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the value of @xmath27 is very close to one for both pion and proton beams . changing a pion beam by a proton beam",
    "does not affect the kinematics of the collisions .",
    "the effective values of parton momentum fractions from the nuclear target are the same for both cases .",
    "therefore , as explained above , the values of @xmath27 is close to one due to the fact that the effective parton momentum fractions from the nuclear target are not large .    in order to enhance the contribution from the double scattering , we need to look for events at large negative @xmath175 , where the effective values of parton momentum fractions from the target are larger . in figs .",
    "[ fig8]b and [ fig9]b , we plot the nuclear dependence parameter @xmath27 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) , as a function of @xmath175 at @xmath176 gev . the same beam , target and beam energy were used .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath175 becomes large and negative , @xmath27 increases .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the negatively larger values of @xmath175 , the bigger effective values of parton momentum fractions from the nuclear target , and consequently , larger derivatives , defined in eq .",
    "( [ e12 ] ) .    comparing figs .",
    "[ fig8]b and [ fig9]b , one finds that as @xmath175 decreases , the values of @xmath27 with a proton beam increases much fast than that with a pion beam .",
    "this is because the compton subprocess dominates the production of direct photons in the case of a proton beam , and the gluon distribution in a proton falls much faster than the valence quark distributions as the momentum fraction increases .",
    "the more rapidly falling gluon distribution produces larger derivative terms , and therefore , larger values of @xmath27 .",
    "future data from fermilab experiment e706 with a proton beam can test this feature .    in summary , using generalized factorization in qcd perturbation theory , and using the method , developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for calculating nuclear enhancements , we demonstrated in this paper that the observed small cronin effect in direct photon production is consistent with the much larger cronin effect observed in single jet and single particle inclusive cross sections .",
    "we hope that the same method can be used to explain the puzzle for the nuclear dependence in the momentum imbalance .",
    "data on dijet momentum imbalance in photoproduction @xcite and hadroproduction @xcite have shown strong nuclear dependence , while much smaller nuclear dependence has been seen in momentum imbalance of drell - yan pairs @xcite .",
