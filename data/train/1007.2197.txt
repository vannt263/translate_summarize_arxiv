    "r__feas(o@xmath10f@xmath11 ) ( _ r _ = rare earth , @xmath121111@xmath12 ) superconductors @xcite with transition temperatures up to 56 k @xcite has stimulated a renewed excitement in the search for novel superconductors derived from antiferromagnetic ( afm ) parent compounds . in these iron - arsenide based compounds ,",
    "the superconducting ( sc ) state can be achieved by doping or by the application of pressure .",
    "the appearance of superconductivity is normally accompanied by a suppression of the afm state in the parent compounds and by the appearance of a spin resonance @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to understand the magnetism in these iron - based parent compounds in order to unravel the mechanism that leads to superconductivity .",
    "because of the initial difficulties to grow large @xmath121111@xmath12 single crystals , most of the research on these systems has been performed on polycrystalline samples .",
    "these studies showed that lafeaso undergoes a structural phase transition from the tetragonal ( t , @xmath13 ) symmetry [ fig.[structures](a ) ] to the orthorhombic ( o , @xmath14 ) one [ fig .",
    "[ structures](b ) ] at @xmath2 @xmath15 155 k and forms an afm ordering ( also referred to as a spin - density - wave - sdw ) at @xmath16 @xmath15 137 k upon cooling , with an ordered magnetic moment of 0.36(5 ) @xmath9 @xcite . implied in these reports on powdered polycrystalline samples",
    "@xcite is that the form factor used is that of fe@xmath6 ion .",
    "however , first - principle calculations on lafeaso predict a larger localized magnetic moment of @xmath82.6 @xmath9 at each iron site that is embedded in an itinerant electronic environment @xcite . it should be noted that density functional theory argues that a large enough magnetic moment @xmath82 @xmath9 is necessary to drive the observed o - t transition @xcite .",
    "it is clear that there is a significant discrepancy between the calculated iron moment and the experimental one .",
    "therefore , determining the moment size is vital to the validity of any theoretical model that attempts to explain the electronic structure of lafeaso .",
    "another important issue is the coupling between structural and magnetic behaviors in iron pnictides .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering studies from polycrstalline lafeaso showed two - dimensional magnetic fluctuations that persist up to room temperature ( over @xmath8160 k above @xmath16 ) .",
    "it was argued @xcite that such fluctuations introduce dynamic disorder of the o / t mixed - phase in the so - called t phase , suggesting that a finite orthorhombicity may exist above the o - t structural transition @xcite .",

    "these questions are related to the complexity of iron chemistry , namely its valence ( or mixed - valence ) , bonding , and electron configuration in different local chemical surroundings . to address these questions ,",
    "the study of high - quality single crystals is vital .",
    "such crystals are now available with the recent successful growth of relatively large @xmath121111@xmath12 single crystals at ambient pressure @xcite .    here",
    "we report elastic neutron scattering and synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction studies on the bulk and pulverized lafeaso single crystals , respectively , focusing on the details of the structural and magnetic transitions as well as the coupling between them , and the measurement of the average ordered magnetic moment size and its spatial distribution by extracting the magnetic form factor of iron in this compound .",
    "lafeaso single crystals were synthesized in an naas flux at ambient pressure as described in a recent report @xcite .",
    "crystal quality was characterized by laue back - scattering , x - ray powder diffraction , heat capacity , magnetization and resistivity measurements . a large lafeaso single crystal ( @xmath820 mg )",
    "was selected for this study .",
    "the mosaic of this single crystal is 0.59(2)@xmath19 full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) for the ( 202)@xmath20 ( o notation ) reflection at room temperature .",
    "the elastic neutron scattering measurements were carried out on the hb-1a fixed - incident - energy ( 14.6 mev ) triple - axis spectrometer using a double pyrolytic graphite ( pg ) monochromator ( located at the high flux isotope reactor , hfir , at the oak ridge national laboratory , usa ) .",
    "two highly oriented pg filters , one after each monochromator , were used to reduce the @xmath21/2 contamination .",
    "the beam collimation throughout the experiment was kept at 48@xmath22 - 48@xmath22-sample-60@xmath22 - 360@xmath22 .",
    "the single crystal was wrapped in al foil and sealed in a he - filled al can which was then loaded on the cold tip of a closed cycle refrigerator with ( _ _ h__0_l_)@xmath20 in the _ cmma _ symmetry as the scattering plane .",
    "the synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction study of pulverized lafeaso single crystals from the same batch as the one used for the neutron diffraction study was carried out at the 11-bm beamline , advanced photon source , argonne national laboratory .",
    "11-bm is a bending magnet beamline , equipped with a vertical beam collimation mirror , a double crystal monochromator with a horizontal sagittal focusing second crystal , and a vertical focusing mirror .",

    "are in agreement with previous reports @xcite .",
    "figure  [ order - params ] shows the temperature evolution of the structural and magnetic transitions in the single crystal measured by neutron diffraction on hb-1a . for the structural transition the ( 400)@xmath20/(040)@xmath20 and ( 006)@xmath20 ( @xmath14 ) reflections were monitored .",
    "the integrated intensity of the rocking - curve scans of the ( 400)@xmath20 reflection shows an appreciable increase at @xmath8156 k , with a relatively sharp maximum at @xmath8148 k. the scattering at the ( 400)@xmath20/(040)@xmath20 rocking curves or @xmath32 - 2@xmath32 scans is strongly influenced by twinning formation upon cooling @xcite that may increase the in - plane mosaicity in the crystal due to nucleation of domains with different orientations at different sites .",
    "based on these observations , we suggest two critical temperatures for the structural transition : first , at @xmath33 @xmath8 156 k , the finite local o domains begin to form side by side with major t domains in a slightly disordered manner ; second , at @xmath3 @xmath8 148 k , the local o precursors have grown into long - range o domains . the temperature range between @xmath33 and @xmath3",
    "may be considered as a coexisting regime of the t and o phases .",
    "the splitting of the ( _ hkl_)@xmath23 ( @xmath13 ) reflection into twinned @xmath34 reflections is a sensitive measure of the t - to - o structural transition . to track the o splitting",

    "it is noted that the ( 220)@xmath23 reflection at 158 k is broader than the ( 400)@xmath20 reflection at 130 k. this may indicate a distribution of d - spacings due to o - t fluctuations above @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "[ sy-2 ] , we show the temperature variation of the fwhm of the ( 004)@xmath35 and ( 220)@xmath23 reflections obtained from a lorentzian fit function to the bragg peaks shown in fig .",
    "[ sy-1 ] . while the width variation of the ( 004)@xmath35 is negligible within errors , the variation of ( 220)@xmath23 is more significant showing a maximum at @xmath8150 k. the normalized fwhm of the ( 220)@xmath23 reflection to that of the ( 004)@xmath35 reflection displays an asymmetric temperature variation with a larger fwhm above the o - t transition [ fig .  [ sy-2](b ) ] .",
    "this indicates remnant orthorhombicity at temperatures as high as 300k .",
    "this is consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite where a finite orthorhombicity remains visible above @xmath3 up to 200 k. similar observations have also been found in srfe@xmath30as@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "we thus argue that both t and o phases may coexist dynamically due to the strong magnetic correlations in a certain temperature range @xcite above _ _",
    "t__@xmath36 , which can be ascribed to a spin nematic phase @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , associate @xmath3 = 148(1 ) k as the o - t phase transition temperature in the single - crystal lafeaso .",
    "we argue that this transition temperature ( @xmath3 ) may vary slightly , depending on the sample quality @xcite , size and shape , and the cooling / warming protocols .",
    "figures  [ order - params](b ) and ( d ) show the temperature dependence of the rocking - curve integrated intensity of the afm ( 103 ) reflection .",
    "the magnetic peak appears at @xmath8140 k , indicating the formation of the afm structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ structures](b ) .      to obtain the magnetic form factor of iron in lafeaso we collected the integrated intensities of the rocking curves of nuclear and magnetic bragg reflections to the highest order possible with the hb-1a spectrometer .",
    "the nuclear reflections , necessary to obtain the magnetic moment size , were chosen to be able to cover as much of the _ q_-range of the measured afm reflections as possible .",
    "this reduces any errors due to geometry corrections , debye - waller factor ( dwf ) , absorption effects , and others .",
    "the integrated intensity of the rocking curve of a nuclear bragg reflection at a reciprocal lattice vector * q * in a crystal is given by : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the scattering volume of the crystal , @xmath39 is the unit - cell volume , @xmath40 is the beam flux at the angle @xmath32 , @xmath41 is the structure factor , @xmath21 is the beam wavelength , @xmath42 is the absorption length , @xmath43 is the lorentz factor for a rotating crystal , and @xmath44 is the dwf .",
    "we collect all the constants and unknown * q*-dependent factors in @xmath45 , including the dwf .",
    "the integrated intensities of the rocking curves of the chosen nuclear bragg reflections were normalized to the corresponding structure factors and the lorentz factors .",
    "the data were also corrected for the fact that the rocking curve of nuclear bragg peaks in our measurements includes an equivalent twinned ( _ _ h__00 ) and ( 0__k__0 ) domains @xcite , for normalization of the magnetic reflections which are due to the ( _ _ h__00 ) domain only .",

    "similarly , the scattered intensity of the rocking curve of a magnetic bragg reflection can be expressed as : @xmath46 where @xmath47 = @xmath48 due to the fact that the afm unit cell is doubled along the crystallographic _",
    "c _ axis in comparison with the nuclear one [ fig .",
    "[ structures](b ) ] , @xmath49 = -1.913 , @xmath50  is the classical electron radius , @xmath51 is the magnetic form factor at the magnetic reciprocal lattice ( * q * ) , @xmath52@xmath53@xmath52 = @xmath52@xmath54@xmath52 = 8 ( _ j _ = 1 to 8) where ( @xmath55 @xmath56",
    "@xmath57 ) represents fractional coordinates of the _",
    "_ j__th atom in the afm unit cell , and @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the unit vectors along the scattering vector and the direction of the moment , respectively .",
    "our attempt to calculate the magnetic form factor with various directions of the ordered magnetic moment yielded an irregular and unphysical form factor , except when the moment points along the o @xmath61 axis , namely , @xmath62 ( 100 ) .",
    "this is strong confirmation that the afm moment direction is along the o _ a _ axis . in tab .",

    "@xcite , we obtain the corresponding average afm moment sizes _ m _",
    "( @xmath9 ) as listed in tab .",
    "[ table3 ] .",
    "the experimental points indicated as a and b in fig.[cnq](b ) deviate from the smooth curves , which may be due to systematic errors or due to some subtle features of the magnetic structure and its dynamics that are not captured by our structure factor determination .",
    "as a simple , heuristic model , we assume that the magnetic moment is homogeneously distributed within a sphere of radius @xmath64 , for which the form factor can be simply calculated by @xmath65 .",
    "fitting our measured data [ circles in fig .",
    "[ cnq](b ) ] with this equation yields an average moment size of ( 0.74@xmath280.04 ) @xmath9 with a radius _ r _ = ( 0.63@xmath280.04 )  .",
    "this radius is almost the same as the effective ionic radius of fe@xmath6 ( 0.63  ) @xcite with a coordination number of 4 , suggesting that the oxidation state of iron in lafeaso is closer to that of fe@xmath6 .",
    "it is pointed out that the effective ionic radius depends on the particular electron configuration as well as the surrounding ions ( as ) and the relative amount of ionic bonding .",
    "the average magnetic moment is @xmath80.8 @xmath9 in the afm phase of single - crystal lafeaso in disagreement with the reported smaller value of @xmath80.37 @xmath9 ( polycrystal ) @xcite , but more or less near the recently reported @xmath80.63(1 ) @xmath9 ( polycrystal ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , the obtained moment size in this study is almost the same as the first - principles - optimized 0.87 @xmath9 in the magnetically frustrated state @xcite , the @xmath80.83 @xmath9 in an oxygen deficient lafeaso ( polycrystal ) @xcite , and the @xmath80.8 @xmath9 in cefeaso ( polycrystal ) @xcite .",
    "first , it is pointed out that there is a large difference in the properties of polycrystalline and single - crystalline samples , especially for those containing easily - sublimating elements or oxides , e.g. , the nominal la@xmath66sr@xmath67mno@xmath68 @xcite .",
    "second , single crystals are believed to be more stoichiometric @xcite and maintain translational symmetry over macroscopic distances , in contrast with polycrystals , thereby providing more reliable information on the structures and intrinsic properties .",
    "the small magnetic moment size @xmath80.8 @xmath9 ( compared to fe@xmath6 in an insulator , @xmath69 with an average ordered localized moment 4 @xmath9 ) is comparable to that of the _ _ a__fe@xmath30as@xmath30 ( _ a _ = ca , sr , ba , @xmath12122@xmath12 ) suggesting an effective @xmath70 on the iron sites @xcite , and to some extent points to the itinerant character of the magnetism in this system .",
    "this puts the @xmath121111@xmath12 compound on a similar par with the other @xmath12122@xmath12 parent compounds with a magnetic moment that is in the range of 0.8 - 1.1 @xmath9 .",
    "this suggests a sharp jump in the magnetic moment of fe ions as a function of the fe - as distance to about 1 @xmath9 , as predicted from first - principle calculations of bulk zinc - blende feas @xcite .",
    "there are a few possible explanations to the small magnetic moment measured by neutron diffraction techniques in iron - pnictides .",
    "the most accepted one is that it is due to the itinerant character of magnetism in this system . on the other hand , in a local moment picture",
    "this may be due to the dimensionality of the system or due to competing nearest neighbors ( nn ) and next - nn ( nnn ) exchange interactions . the fe layers are weakly coupled making each layer behave as a quasi-2d system .",
    "the 2d systems , especially those with isotropic nn coupling , exhibit strong magnetic fluctuations that can lower the quasi - static ordered magnetic moment .",
    "second , the unusual spin arrangement observed in iron - pnictides indicates the presence of strong competing and conflicting interactions between nn ( @xmath71 ) and nnn ( @xmath72 ) that can lead to strong magnetic fluctuations and a reduced static moment .",
    "to summarize , employing both neutron and synchrotron diffraction techniques to explore the details of the structural and magnetic properties of single - crystal lafeaso , we found : ( 1 ) the o - t structural transition occurs at @xmath73 148 k , but the finite local o precursors appear to form already at @xmath0 k. we argue that the t and o phases may coexist in the temperature range of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and at @xmath3 the long - range o phase has formed .",
    "( 2 ) the afm structure forms at @xmath4 k upon cooling with the iron moment direction along the crystallographic _ a _ axis in the o structural regime . ( 3 ) the average afm moment size is comparable with that of the _ _ a__fe@xmath30as@xmath30 ( _ a _ = ca , sr , ba ) , e.g. , _",
    "= ( 0.82@xmath280.03 ) @xmath9 with a form factor of fe@xmath6 with spin contribution only .",
    "this moment size is significantly larger than the previously reported values .",
    "more detailed studies of the form - factor will be required to determine the possibility of the recently predicted spin spatial anisotropy @xcite .",
    "this study shows that to a large extent the properties of lafeaso are very similar to those of the so - called @xmath12122@xmath12 system .",

    "<S> elastic neutron scattering studies of an optimized lafeaso single crystal reveal that upon cooling , an onset of the tetragonal ( t)-to - orthorhombic ( o ) structural transition occurs at @xmath0 k , and it exhibits a sharp transition at @xmath1 k. we argue that in the temperature range @xmath2 to @xmath3 , t and o structures may dynamically coexist possibly due to nematic spin correlations recently proposed for the iron pnictides , and we attribute @xmath3 to the formation of long - range o domains from the finite local precursors . </S>",
    "<S> the antiferromagnetic structure emerges at @xmath4 k , with the iron moment direction along the o _ a _ axis . </S>",
    "<S> we extract the iron magnetic form factor and use the tabulated @xmath5 of fe , fe@xmath6 and fe@xmath7 to obtain a magnetic moment size of @xmath80.8 @xmath9 at 9.5 k. </S>"
