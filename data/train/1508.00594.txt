    "in 1998 bender and boettcher  @xcite described a class of non - hermitian ` hamiltonians ' that exhibit a purely real energy spectrum , a surprising fact which they attributed to the underlying @xmath0 ( parity- and time - reversal ) symmetry .",
    "their observation triggered considerable interest in discrete and continuous systems with @xmath0 symmetry along with alternative non - hermitian formulations of quantum theory  @xcite .",
    "such fundamental considerations remain speculative , but there exist many classical systems in which @xmath0-symmetric dynamics can be obtained with appropriately engineered loss and gain .",
    "this was first pointed out in the context of photonic waveguides  @xcite , lattices , and resonators  @xcite .",
    "other examples include cold atoms  @xcite and optomechanical devices  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest in such systems is the @xmath1 of @xmath0 symmetry , i.e. , when by tuning a parameter the energy spectrum becomes complex and the eigenvectors no longer exhibit the underlying @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this phenomenon was first experimentally observed in optical waveguides  @xcite , and is currently the subject of intense experimental and theoretical research .    in this work",
    "we go beyond this dynamical picture and address an interesting and still open question : what are the _ steady _ states of actual physical systems with @xmath0 symmetry ?",
    "this question becomes especially important for atomic or microscopic solid - state realizations of gain - loss systems .",
    "here nonlinear saturation effects as well as the presence of thermal and quantum noise have a crucial influence on the system s dynamics and the long - time behavior can no longer be inferred from an eigenvalue analysis only . by focusing on the experimentally relevant example of coupled mechanical resonators with optically - induced gain and loss ( see fig .  [ introfig ] ) we show that @xmath0-symmetry breaking in the steady state exhibits various unexpected features and in general occurs via additional intermediate phases with retained or ` weakly ' broken @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "most importantly , we identify an unconventional transition from a high - noise balanced energy distribution to a parity - broken lasing state with strongly reduced fluctuations .",
    "this transition generalizes the phenomenon of @xmath0-symmetry breaking  hitherto defined only for eigenstates  to steady - state distributions of noisy systems .",
    "the mechanisms described here occur in systems of two coupled modes as well as in multi - resonator arrays , and will thus be of relevance for a large range of @xmath0 symmetric systems operated at low amplitudes and close to the quantum regime .     and @xmath2 lead to a net absorption or emission of phonons of frequency @xmath3 ( see reference  @xcite for more details ) . ,",
    "to motivate the following analysis by a concrete physical system , we consider a setup of two micromechanical resonators as shown in figure  [ introfig ]  a ) .",
    "the main findings discussed below , however , are more general and can be studied in other equivalent realizations , e.g. , with coupled optical or microwave resonators .",
    "the mechanical resonators have a bare vibrational frequency @xmath3 and they are mutually coupled , e.g. , mechanically via the support , with strength @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , optical or electrical cooling  @xcite and pumping  @xcite schemes are used to induce mechanical loss for one resonator and an _ equal _ amount of mechanical gain for the other . in a frame rotating with @xmath3 , the semiclassical dynamics of the system",
    "is then described by the it stochastic differential equation  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the dimensionless amplitudes of the pumped and cooled mode respectively ( more details on the derivation of equation   are given in  [ sec : lasertheory ] ) .",
    "the optically - induced gain and loss rates considered here are of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the maximal rate and @xmath10 is the saturation amplitude .",
    "the value of @xmath11 characterizes the underlying heating or cooling mechanism and will be treated here as an adjustable parameter .",
    "for the three - level scheme depicted in figure  [ introfig ]  b ) this parameter takes the value @xmath12  @xcite . instead , for conventional laser amplification with inverted two - level systems we would obtain @xmath13  @xcite . finally , @xmath14 is the bare mechanical damping rate .",
    "since we are interested in the @xmath0-symmetric limit ( defined below ) , we assume @xmath15 . however ,",
    "in all our calculations we retain a finite @xmath16 , which describes the actual physical situation and results in a well - defined steady state for all parameter regimes .    in equation   the ( complex ) stochastic forces @xmath17 represent two independent white - noise processes with @xmath18 .",
    "for resonators coupled to a reservoir of temperature @xmath19 the diffusion rates are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "the contribution @xmath23 for the gain mode represents the intrinsic quantum noise associated with any amplification process and suggests that noise is a fundamental property of @xmath0-symmetric systems  @xcite .",
    "by ignoring the effect of noise and assuming @xmath24 , equation   can be written as @xmath25 , with a state vector @xmath26 and a non - hermitian ` hamiltonian ' @xmath27 this hamiltonian is invariant under a combined parity ( @xmath28 ) and time - reversal ( @xmath29 ) symmetry for _ all _ values of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 simply corresponds to an exchange of the two modes and @xmath32 .",
    "the eigenvalues and ( unnormalized ) eigenvectors of @xmath33 are  @xcite @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "we see that despite being non - hermitian , for @xmath38 both eigenvalues @xmath39 are real , indicating purely coherent oscillations between the two modes . in this regime of unbroken @xmath0 symmetry",
    "the eigenvectors are eigenstates of the symmetry operator , i.e. , @xmath40 . for @xmath41 ,",
    "both eigenvalues become imaginary and correspond to a gain and a loss eigenmode . in this regime @xmath42",
    "is complex and @xmath43 no longer possess the same symmetry as @xmath33 .",
    "one thus speaks of a @xmath0-symmetry - breaking transition occurring at the ( exceptional ) point @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "this conventionally studied @xmath0-symmetry - breaking effect captures the change in the system s transient dynamics , as it is observed , e.g. , in the propagation of coupled optical modes through an active medium with loss and gain  @xcite .",
    "however , a simple eigenvalue analysis does not afford any conclusions concerning its steady state .",
    "firstly , due to an exponentially amplified mode in the symmetry - broken phase , nonlinear effects must be taken into account in order to determine the system s long - time behavior  @xcite .",
    "secondly , due to non - decaying oscillations in the @xmath0-symmetric phase , any source of noise would heat up the system indefinitely , and within a linearized model the steady state would again be ill - defined .",

    "d )  the resulting steady state ( green square ) for each phase.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    let us now return to the full model in equation   and evaluate the stationary state @xmath51 in the absence of noise .",
    "figures  [ phasesfig ]  a ) and  b ) show the mode occupation numbers @xmath52 and @xmath53 as a function of @xmath54 , and for the two relevant cases @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "firstly , we observe in both plots the expected transition at @xmath55 , below which ( phase @xmath56 ) the system dynamics is oscillatory with a small overall damping to @xmath57 due to a finite @xmath58 . above this transition point ( phase * ii * ) the linearized system dynamics becomes unstable and both resonators reach a finite steady - state occupation number @xmath59 , determined by the saturation of @xmath60 .",
    "however , this steady state is still an eigenstate of the symmetry operator , @xmath61 , and contrary to our na \" i ve expectation the system remains @xmath0-symmetric beyond the conventional transition point .",
    "the existence of a @xmath0-symmetric steady - state with non - vanishing amplitude is permitted in models like the present one , where @xmath0-symmetry is retained even in the nonlinear regime .",
    "this means that a steady state @xmath62 with @xmath63 results in an _ equal _ suppression of both the gain and the loss rate , @xmath64 [ see equation  ] .",
    "this implies that there exists a symmetric state which satisfies @xmath65 for all values of @xmath54 .",
    "however , as one can see in figure  [ phasesfig ] , at larger values of @xmath9 the system eventually switches to a different , symmetry - broken state .",
    "as we discuss now , the details of this @xmath0-symmetry - breaking mechanism and the resulting state depend on the actual form of the saturable gain , which is here determined by the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "considering first the case @xmath12 , we find a second transition at @xmath66 , beyond which ( phase @xmath67 ) @xmath68 and the steady state breaks parity , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath0-symmetry - breaking point can be obtained from a linear stability analysis for phase * ii * and for the present model we find @xmath70 this result would imply the absence of symmetry breaking for @xmath13 . instead ,",
    "for this case we observe a hopf bifurcation around @xmath71 , beyond which the system approaches a limit cycle and undergoes periodic oscillations with the characteristic frequency @xmath72 .",
    "the limit cycle is formed symmetrically around a central point @xmath73 with @xmath74 , meaning that @xmath0-symmetry is preserved on average , but not at each point in time . to distinguish this behavior from the previous case",
    "we say that in this phase ( @xmath48 ) the @xmath0 symmetry is only ` weakly ' broken .",
    "in contrast to full symmetry breaking , this transition is related to the finite asymmetry induced by @xmath58 , and would be hidden in the idealized models where @xmath75 .",
    "the value for the transition point is @xmath76 independent of the precise value of @xmath77 .",
    "the general expressions in equations   and   show that for all intermediate cases , @xmath78 , we obtain @xmath79 and @xmath0-symmetry breaking occurs in three steps @xmath80 .",
    "more details on the derivation of the above results and the stationary phases for general @xmath11 are given in  [ sec : dynamicalanalysis ] .",
    "while similar nonlinear phenomena are in general expected for gain - loss systems  @xcite , our specific interest here is to understand the role of dynamical instabilities in the breaking of a steady - state symmetry . in particular , the above analysis shows that @xmath0-symmetry breaking occurs even in systems where the symmetry is fully retained in the nonlinear regime and a symmetric steady - state would be permitted in principle for all parameters .",
    "we now show how the above picture changes in the presence of noise .",
    "for clarity we first restrict ourselves to a system which is dominated by thermal diffusion , i.e. @xmath81 . for @xmath82 thermal noise induces additional amplitude fluctuations of about @xmath83 , and we expect that as long as @xmath84 the characteristic features shown in figure  [ phasesfig ] , which scale with the saturation number @xmath85 , will only be smeared out , but not change significantly .",
    "this is confirmed numerically ( not shown ) and means that figure  [ phasesfig ] is a good representation of the steady states of the system in the weakly nonlinear or low - noise regime .",
    "therefore , we will now address the opposite regime @xmath86 .",

    "the exact marginal distributions @xmath97 and @xmath98 are then fitted by approximate distributions of the form @xmath99 which allows us to extract a radial shift @xmath88 and @xmath89 and the range of fluctuations @xmath100 and @xmath101 for both modes ( see  [ sec : numerics ] ) . from these values",
    "plotted in figure  [ noisefig ]  a ) we see that the thermal noise now completely washes out the features associated with the @xmath0-symmetric phases * i * and * ii * , and for a large range of @xmath9 the system reaches a steady state ( phase @xmath102 ) , which is to a good approximation thermal , i.e. , @xmath103 and @xmath104 . only after a critical value of @xmath105 are the fluctuations suddenly strongly suppressed . in this regime",
    "the system relaxes into an asymmetric coherent state with @xmath106 approximately given by the amplitudes @xmath107 and @xmath108 given in equation   and @xmath109 .",
    "before we proceed , let us connect this transition to the phenomenon of @xmath0-symmetry breaking  hitherto defined only for individual states .",
    "to do so we introduce the @xmath0-symmetry parameter @xmath110 which vanishes for a random set of states @xmath111 if and only if each state satisfies @xmath112 , with some real phase @xmath113 . figure  [ noisefig ]  b ) shows that indeed @xmath90 changes at the transition point from @xmath114 for a thermal state to @xmath115 in the symmetry - broken phase .",
    "note that also in the low - noise limit we obtain @xmath116 in phase @xmath56 and therefore only phase @xmath117 , where @xmath118 , has a strictly @xmath0-symmetric steady state .",
    "one of the most striking features visible in figures  [ noisefig ]  a ) and c ) is that in sharp contrast to a conventional lasing transition , the emerging coherent - state amplitudes after the @xmath0-symmetry breaking point are even smaller than the original level of thermal noise .",
    "this surprising effect can be understood as follows .",
    "although at each instant in time the amplitudes @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and therefore the gain and loss rates @xmath121 and @xmath122 , can be quite different , the average dissipation rate @xmath123 when evaluated in the thermal phase vanishes , @xmath124 . what remains ( on average ) is the weak coupling to the high - temperature environment .",
    "in contrast , in the symmetry - broken phase we have @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , there is a strong imbalance between loss and gain on average , i.e. , @xmath126 , and the resulting net cooling effect suppresses fluctuations .",
    "thus , this transition in the average dissipation rate of a stationary system can be seen as the counterpart of the transition from real to imaginary eigenvalues in the conventional definition of @xmath0-symmetry breaking .",
    "what we are still missing , however , is a simple criterion , which tells us why the system favors one or the other steady state .     of the loss mode for @xmath127 .",
    "b ) dependence of the symmetry breaking point @xmath128 on @xmath129 .",
    "the solid line represents the prediction from our analytic model and the squares show the transition points obtained from the condition @xmath130 in numerical simulations.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    to clarify the mechanism behind the symmetry - breaking transition we focus on the symmetry - broken regime @xmath131 , where we can assume that the amplitude of the gain mode @xmath132 and the relative phase @xmath133 are approximately constant .",
    "we then obtain the equation of motion for the amplitude of the loss mode , @xmath134  @xcite , @xmath135 where @xmath136 and ( for @xmath137 ) @xmath138 the function @xmath139 is an effective potential for @xmath140 , which is sketched in fig .",
    "[ krammersfig ]  a ) .",
    "this potential has a local minimum at @xmath141 ( corresponding to the steady state given in equation   for @xmath142 ) , which is separated by a finite barrier @xmath143 from the unstable region @xmath144 . in the presence of noise ,",
    "a system initially located at @xmath145 can escape over this barrier via thermally activated processes with a characteristic rate @xmath146 , where @xmath147  @xcite .",
    "this rate increases as @xmath9 is reduced and once @xmath148 exceeds the bare damping @xmath14 , any configuration with fixed @xmath6 and @xmath7 is rapidly destabilized and the transition to a quasi - thermal state with strongly fluctuating amplitudes occurs . in figure  [ krammersfig ]  b ) we compare the transition point @xmath149 obtained from the condition @xmath150 with the numerically evaluated values for various @xmath151 .",
    "the plot shows that @xmath0-symmetry breaking in the large - noise regime is very well described by this thermal activation model .",
    "as it has been pointed out above , the implementation of any gain mechanism is necessarily accompanied by a minimum amount of quantum noise , @xmath152 , which ensures , e.g. , the preservation of heisenberg s uncertainty relations in a quantum mechanical amplification process . for @xmath0-symmetric systems",
    "this implies that noise is not only an intrinsic property , but also that the symmetry in the gain and loss modes is broken on a fundamental level .",

    "the assumed form of @xmath156 applies for the three - level gain mechanism shown in figure  [ introfig ] , i.e. , for the case @xmath12 ( see  [ sec : lasertheory ] for additional details ) .",
    "similar to the thermal noise limit discussed above we represent the resulting steady - state distributions for the loss and gain modes by the distribution maxima @xmath88 , @xmath89 and the range of fluctuations @xmath153 and @xmath154 respectively .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ quantumnoisefig ] for a saturation parameter @xmath157 .",
    "we see that while the steady - state distributions for low @xmath9 do no longer represent thermal states , there still exists a sharp transition between a high - noise @xmath0-symmetric phase and a @xmath0-symmetry - broken phase with strongly reduced fluctuations .",
    "thus , we conclude that the @xmath0-symmetry - breaking mechanism identified above is not very sensitive to the details of the noise process and will exist in both thermal and quantum noise limited systems .",
    "note that the semi - classical descriptions used in the current analysis is only valid for @xmath160 while for @xmath161 where quantum effects are most important a full quantum mechanical treatment must be employed .",
    "such an analysis is , however , beyond the scope of the current work and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "finally , to show that @xmath0-symmetry breaking in the steady state exists also for extended systems , we generalize the analysis above to coupled resonator arrays with alternating gain and loss  @xcite , as depicted in figure  [ arrayfig ]  a ) . in this case",

    "figure  [ arrayfig ] summarizes the numerical results for the steady state of an array of @xmath165 resonators with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath45 .",
    "the observed features can be understood from the plane wave ansatz  @xcite @xmath170 , @xmath171 , where @xmath172 .",
    "this ansatz maps equation   onto a two - mode problem for @xmath173 and @xmath174 , which is equivalent to equation  , but with the replacement @xmath175 .",
    "this implies that the largest ratio @xmath176 is always achieved for the @xmath177 mode  @xcite , which therefore determines the symmetry - breaking properties of the array .",
    "for the special case @xmath178 , i.e. , @xmath179 , the gain and the loss modes completely decouple , and @xmath0-symmetry breaking already occurs for @xmath180  @xcite . for all intermediate parameters",
    "the phase boundaries in figure  [ arrayfig ] are obtained from the analytic results for the two - mode problem , but with @xmath4 replaced by @xmath181 .",
    "we see that the single - mode ansatz captures well the relevant physics both in the low- and high - noise regime .",
    "note that , however , in the ` thermal ' phase the behavior of the array can actually be much more complicated , since the system may undergo noise - induced jumps between multiple metastable configurations .",
    "we have analyzed the breaking of @xmath0 symmetry in the steady state of coupled mechanical systems with loss and gain .",
    "we have shown how saturation effects and the influence of thermal or quantum noise lead to surprising new effects , which are not expected from the conventional eigenvalue analysis of idealized @xmath0-symmetric systems .",

    "consulting figure  [ fig : figure1 ]  a ) , one sees that as @xmath254 is increased the stationary state   goes from a stable spiral to an unstable spiral and then to a saddle node .",
    "we thus conclude that phase * ii * is exhibited for @xmath255      in both phase @xmath48 and @xmath67 the occupation numbers are not even roughly equal . to analyze this regime it is instructive to consider the nullclines ( the curves in the @xmath226-@xmath140-plane specified by setting either @xmath256 or @xmath257 ; the intersections of nullclines correspond to stationary states ) : @xmath258 the function @xmath259 is always positive , and only zero at @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",

    "it is clear that phase @xmath48 corresponds to the case of two intersections , and from the previous section we know",
    "that if @xmath267^{\\nu } < \\gamma / g < [ \\nu / ( \\nu - 1)]^\\nu$ ] then neither of these two intersections corresponds to a stable stationary state . therefore ,",
    "by the poincar - bendixon theorem  @xcite , a limit cycle must exist .",
    "we thus conclude that phase @xmath48 is exhibited for @xmath268 but the limit cycle persists slightly beyond this upper bound . since it is only possible that @xmath253^\\nu > [ ( \\nu + 2 \\nu^2 + \\sqrt{2 \\nu + 3 \\nu^2 } ) / ( 2 \\nu^2 - 1)]^{\\nu}$ ] if @xmath269 , this phase can not be observed for @xmath270 .",
    "the limit cycle does not admit a simple analytic form , however by assuming that it is small and centered on stationary state  , which is the only unstable spiral for this regime , one may approximate its frequency @xmath271 by the imaginary part of the eigenvalue of the jacobian evaluated at equation  .",
    "one finds @xmath272 ; this result has been numerically verified for the case @xmath46 ( not shown ) . on the other hand , it is also clear that phase * iii * corresponds to the case of four intersections .",
    "one may show that there are four intersections only if @xmath273^\\nu$ ] , and it appears that ( at least for @xmath270 ) of the two extra stationary states one must be an unstable spiral and the other a stable spiral .",
    "we thus conclude that phase * iii * is exhibited for @xmath274 note that this phase can not be observed for @xmath46 . for @xmath45",

    "since we are interested in the steady state of the system , we collect data ( complex numbers @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) after a time of @xmath276 where @xmath277 is approximately the time scale in which the steady state is approached . over a period of @xmath278 we select @xmath279 random data points .",
    "we repeat the procedure @xmath280 times with random initial conditions .    from the numerical data we obtain the marginal steady - state distributions @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the two modes . since the system is invariant under a combined rotation of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in phase space ,",
    "also the marginal distributions are radially symmetric .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure2 ] shows examples of the resulting radial distribution @xmath281 for the gain mode , before , close to , and after the transition .    to obtain a simple characterization of the system s steady state",

    "it corresponds to a thermal state for @xmath284 and @xmath285 and approaches the distribution of a coherent state with random phase in the limit @xmath286 .",
    "the optimal values for @xmath287 and @xmath288 are obtained by minimization of the squared difference @xmath289 where @xmath290 represents the hight of the @xmath291th bar of the histogram .    while this fitting procedure yields accurate values for the radial displacement of the distribution maximum , @xmath88 , we find that the corresponding values for the width @xmath288 do not very well capture the broad thermal background in the vicinity of the transition [ see figure  [ fig : figure2 ] b ) ] .",

    "<S> the phenomenon of @xmath0 ( parity- and time - reversal ) symmetry breaking is conventionally associated with a change in the complex mode spectrum of a non - hermitian system that marks a transition from a purely oscillatory to an exponentially amplified dynamical regime . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we describe a new type of @xmath0-symmetry breaking , which occurs in the steady - state energy distribution of open systems with balanced gain and loss . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the combination of nonlinear saturation effects and the presence of thermal or quantum noise in actual experiments results in unexpected behavior that differs significantly from the usual dynamical picture . </S>",
    "<S> we observe additional phases with preserved or ` weakly ' broken @xmath0 symmetry , and an unconventional transition from a high - noise thermal state to a low - amplitude lasing state with broken symmetry and strongly reduced fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these effects here for the specific example of coupled mechanical resonators with optically - induced loss and gain , but the described mechanisms will be essential for a general understanding of the steady - state properties of actual @xmath0-symmetric systems operated at low amplitudes or close to the quantum regime . </S>"
