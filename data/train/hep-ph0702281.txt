    "although the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking remains a mystery , it is clear that this mechanism must give mass to two very different classes of particles : the electroweak gauge bosons and the fermions . in the standard model , the scalar higgs @xcite doublet couples directly to both classes of particles @xcite .",
    "moreover , the gauge and yukawa couplings through which the higgs interacts , respectively , with gauge bosons and fermions are proportional to the masses generated for those states when the scalar doublet acquires a vacuum expectation value .",
    "nonetheless , in considering physics beyond the standard model , the possibility remains that the gauge boson and fermion masses are generated through different mechanisms .",
    "in particular , it is possible that electroweak symmetry breaking is transmitted to the fermions via some intermediary physics specifically associated with fermion mass generation .",
    "appelquist and chanowitz @xcite have shown that the tree - level , spin-0 scattering amplitude for fermion - anti - fermion pairs to scatter into longitudinally - polarized electroweak gauge bosons grows linearly with energy below the scale of the physics responsible for transmitting electroweak symmetry breaking to the fermions . as the amplitude must be unitary",
    ", one can derive an _ upper _ bound on the scale of fermion mass generation by finding the energy at which the amplitude would grow to be of order 1/2 .",
    "the rate of energy growth is proportional to the mass of the fermions involved .",
    "the most stringent bound , therefore , arises from top - quark annihilation , and the bound on the scale of top - quark mass generation is found to be of order a few tev .",
    "as emphasized by golden @xcite , the interpretation of the appelquist - chanowitz ( ac ) bound on the scale of top - quark mass generation can be problematic : longitudinal electroweak gauge - boson elastic scattering itself grows quadratically with energy @xcite below the scale of the physics responsible for electroweak gauge - boson mass generation . as the scale of the physics responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking is also bounded by of order a tev , it can be difficult to be sure that the violation of unitarity in fermion annihilation is truly independent of the violation of unitarity in the gauge - boson sector .",
    "the standard model illustrates this difficulty , as in that case the higgs boson is responsible for restoring unitarity in _ both _ the fermion annihilation and gauge - boson scattering processes .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss unitarity violation and the resulting bounds on the scale of top - quark mass generation in the context of deconstructed higgsless models .",
    "higgsless models @xcite achieve electroweak symmetry breaking without introducing a fundamental scalar higgs boson @xcite , and the unitarity of longitudinally - polarized @xmath1 and @xmath2 boson scattering @xcite is preserved by the exchange of extra vector bosons @xcite .",
    "inspired by tev - scale @xcite compactified five - dimensional gauge theories @xcite , these models provide effectively unitary descriptions of the electroweak sector beyond 1 tev .",
    "deconstruction @xcite is a technique to build a four - dimensional gauge theory , with an appropriate gauge - symmetry breaking pattern , which approximates the properties of a five - dimensional theory .",
    "deconstructed higgsless models @xcite have been used as tools to compute the general properties of higgsless theories , and to illustrate the phenomenological properties of this class of models .",
    "the simplest deconstructed higgsless model @xcite incorporates only three sites on the deconstructed lattice , and the only additional vector states ( other than the usual electroweak gauge bosons ) are a triplet of vector bosons . while simple , the three site model is sufficiently rich to describe the physics associated with fermion mass generation , as well as the fermion delocalization @xcite required in order to accord with precision electroweak tests @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize this model to an arbitrary number of sites @xcite . in the continuum limit ( the limit in which the number of sites goes to infinity )",
    ", this model reproduces the five - dimensional model introduced in @xcite .",
    "a fermion field in a general compactified five - dimensional theory gives rise to a tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes , the lightest of which can ( under chiral boundary conditions ) be massless in the absence of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the lightest states can therefore be identified with the ordinary fermions .",
    "the massive kaluza - klein fermion modes are , however , massive dirac fermions from the four - dimensional point of view .",
    "correspondingly , the fermions in a deconstructed higgsless model include both chiral and vector - like electroweak states @xcite , and generation of the masses of the ordinary fermions in these models involves the mixing of the chiral and vector states @xcite .",
    "as we will demonstrate , the scale of top - quark mass generation in these models depends on the masses of the vector - like fermions ( the  kk \" modes ) , as well as on the number of sites in the deconstructed lattice .",
    "what is particularly interesting about deconstructed higgsless models , in this context , is that one _ can _ distinguish between the unitarity - derived bounds on the scales of gauge - boson and top - quark mass generation .",
    "we will demonstrate that , for an appropriate number of deconstructed lattice sites , spin-0 top - quark annihilation to longitudinally - polarized gauge - bosons remains unitary at tree - level up to energies much higher than the naive ac bound if the vector - like fermions are light .",
    "however the ac bound is reproduced as the mass of the vector - like fermion is increased .",
    "therefore , for fixed top - quark and gauge - boson masses , the bound on the scale of fermion mass generation interpolates smoothly between the ac bound and one that can , potentially , be much higher as the mass of the vector - like fermion varies .",
    "the unitarity bounds on elastic scattering of longitudinal electroweak gauge bosons in higgsless models @xcite , however , depend only on the masses of the gauge - boson kk modes . in this sense , the bound on the scale of fermion mass generation is _ independent _ of the bound on the scale of gauge - boson mass generation .",
    "while our discussion is restricted to deconstructed higgsless models , many models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking incorporate the mixing of chiral and vector fermions to accommodate top - quark mass generation .",
    "examples include the top - quark seesaw model @xcite , and models in which the top mixes with composite fermions arising from a dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking sector @xcite .",
    "indeed , the fermion delocalization required to construct a realistic higgsless model is naturally interpreted , in the context of ads / cft duality @xcite , as mixing between fundamental and composite fermions @xcite . as chiral - vector fermion mixing",
    "is the basic feature required for our results , we expect similar effects in these other models .    in the next section , to set notation and make contact with the literature , we reproduce @xcite the appelquist - chanowitz bound in the electroweak chiral lagrangian @xcite  which may be interpreted as a  two - site \" higgsless model . in section three , we introduce the @xmath3 site higgsless models that we will use for our calculations .",
