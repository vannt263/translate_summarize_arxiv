    "the projected two - point galaxy correlation function @xmath6 has proved to be one of the most enduring statistics in observational cosmology .",
    "this is a consequence of the relative ease with which it may be measured ; for each galaxy , all one requires is positions and magnitudes .",
    "starting with the early studies of clustering in the local universe using schmidt plates @xcite to more recent works using ccd - based detectors @xcite these studies have probed galaxy clustering to very faint magnitudes .",
    "normally , these surveys measure how the amplitude of the projected angular correlation function at a fixed angular separation , @xmath11 , varies as a function of sample limiting magnitude  the `` scaling relation '' .",
    "usually , this relation has been parametrised in terms of `` epsilon models '' in which the three - dimensional correlation length @xmath12 scales monotonically with redshift @xcite .",
    "these models also require a choice of cosmology and knowledge of the underlying redshift distributions for each magnitude - limited sample .    in this paper we will investigate the projected angular clustering of the faint field galaxy population .",
    "we characterise galaxy clustering as a function of sample limiting magnitude in @xmath13 bandpasses .",
    "our primary dataset is a deep , ground based survey of an area called the william herschel deep field ( whdf ) .",
    "this has been described in several recent papers @xcite . covering @xmath14",
    "arcmin@xmath15 this survey comprises an area @xmath16 times larger area than the separate hdf - n and hdf - s fields . for comparison , we also present a complementary analysis of clustering amplitudes measured in these smaller fields , utilising the catalogues produced in metcalfe et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "although similar studies of @xmath6 exist in the literature @xcite our survey differs primarily in its depth ( @xmath2 ) and broad wavelength coverage ( in this analysis we consider samples selected in @xmath17 bandpasses ) .    to interpret our results we use redshift distributions derived from the luminosity evolution models we have described in our previous papers ( @xcite .",
    "these models are able to reproduce all the observable quantities of the faint field galaxy population ( counts , colours , redshift distributions ) , at least for low @xmath18 universes and within current observational uncertainties @xcite ; it is these successes which give us confidence in using our models as probe of the clustering history of the universe , rather than using our measurements of @xmath11 as a probe of the underlying redshift distributions . in our models ,",
    "high @xmath18 universes can be accommodated by the model if we add an extra population of low luminosity galaxies with constant star - formation rates which boost the counts at faint ( @xmath19 ) magnitude levels @xcite .",
    "we also consider flat cosmologies with @xmath20 . for reference , the scaling relation computed for a model with stable clustering and no luminosity evolution is also presented .",
    "models such as those presented in this paper are relatively successful in describing clustering measurements performed on deep blank - field surveys like the one detailed in this work @xcite .",
    "however , observations of the clustering properties of lyman - break galaxies @xcite indicate that these objects have comparable clustering properties @xcite to some classes of locally observed galaxies , making such objects initially difficult to understand in terms of this monotonic scaling of @xmath21 with redshift",
    ". we will explain how these observations can be understood in the context of the results presented in this paper .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : herschel - deep - field ] we describe in outline the preparation of our datasets ; in section  [ sec : methtech ] we describe the techniques we use to measure and analyse our data ; in section [ sec : meas - ampl - scal ] we present our measurements of the projected correlation function in five bandpasses in comparison with previous work and investigate if our errors estimates are realistic ; in section  [ sec : interpr - disc ] we compare our correlation measurements with the predictions of our evolutionary models ; and finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions - summary ] we outline the main conclusions from this work .",
    "full details of the optical observations comprising the whdf will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( metcalfe et al 2000 ) .",
    "a subset of our infrared observations of the whdf is described in which comprises the @xmath22 ukirt observations .",
    "additional infrared observations at calar alto observatory produced a second catalogue limited at @xmath23 which will be fully described in a separate paper ( mccracken et al , in preparation ) . in this section",
    "we will briefly describe our object detection and photometry techniques which are very similar to that used in our previous galaxy counts papers @xcite .",
    "all our optical data discussed in this paper was taken at the william herschel telescope ( wht ) , with the exception of a short @xmath24band exposure made at the isaac newton telescope ( int ) .",
    "after bias subtraction and flat - fielding , the sky background is removed and isophotal image detection is carried out .",
    "these images are then removed from the frame , replaced by a local sky value , and the resulting frame smoothed heavily before being subtracted from the original .",
    "this produces a very flat background .",
    "the isophotal detection process is then repeated .",
    "a -type pseudo - total magnitude is then calculated for each image , using a local value of sky .",
    "table [ tab : intro.limits ] shows the magnitude limits for our fields . as in our previous papers",
    "the minimum kron radius is set to be that for an unresolved image of high signal - to - noise , and the correction to total is the light outside this minimum radius for such an image .",
    "our measurement limits give the total magnitudes of unresolved objects which are a @xmath25 detection inside the minimum radius ( which is typically @xmath26 for the whdf data ) .",
    "star - galaxy separation was done on the @xmath27 frame using the difference between the total magnitude and that inside a @xmath28 aperture , as described in .",
    "this enabled us to separate to @xmath29 .",
    "some additional very red stars were identified from the @xmath30 and @xmath31 frames . as the whdf is at high galactic latitude the stellar contamination should in any case be quite low . for the purposes of measuring the correlation function ,",
    "masks files were also constructed to cover regions containing bright galaxies or stars .",
    "the area of the field affected by such bright objects is less than @xmath32 of the total .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : fitse0r0 ]    in general , we find @xmath33 for @xmath34  mpc and @xmath35 , from our own data alone .",
    "as we have already discussed , in the @xmath31- band our points are different from those of at the @xmath36 level .",
    "their survey subtends @xmath37 on the sky , and reaches similar depths to our own work , and so we would expect this survey to sample the same environments as our own , and therefore to show broadly similar growth of clustering . combining s three @xmath31- limited points with our own , we derive @xmath38 , again for @xmath34  mpc .",
    "= 10.0 cm    we have also carried out a simulation similar to those described in section  [ sec : errors - biases ] to see how secure is our rejection of the co - moving amplitude in the range @xmath39 , the results of which are presented in figure  [ fig : berr ] .",
    "this simulation has the same galaxy number density as our observations at @xmath40 and covers an area of @xmath41  deg@xmath1 .",
    "it contains a total of @xmath42 galaxies for an integral constraint @xmath43 .",
    "the simulation has log@xmath44 ( bootstrap errors ) , corresponding to the amplitude of our co - moving evolutionary model at this magnitude . errors calculated by resampling 100 whdf - sized fields over this area gives a median @xmath45 ( 1@xmath46 ) and log@xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) . at @xmath49",
    "we measure log@xmath50 ( bootstrap errors ) . out of the 100 simulated fields",
    ", there are only two measurements at or below this value , leading us to conclude that in this magnitude range our measurement and the co - moving amplitude differs by at least @xmath48 .",
    "how does this observed rate of clustering growth compare with measurements from the literature ?",
    "with deeper pencil - beam spectroscopic surveys , it has become possible to measure @xmath21 at successively earlier epochs and to use this to infer a value for @xmath51 . using a statistically complete subsample of @xmath52 galaxies from the canada - france redshift survey @xcite ,",
    "were able to measure the evolution of @xmath21 in the interval @xmath53 .",
    "they found @xmath54mpc ( for @xmath35 ) , implying @xmath55 . , using a sample of 248 galaxies , found that for @xmath56 galaxies , @xmath57  mpc . at higher redshift ,",
    "derive @xmath58  mpc , which , combined with the lower redshift points from their survey , leads to @xmath59 . the canadian network for observational cosmology ( cnoc )",
    "have recently completed a large field galaxy survey in the range @xmath60 with a sample size of @xmath61 galaxies @xcite . for luminous objects with corrected @xmath30-band absolute magnitudes of @xmath62 they find a slower clustering growth : @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , strongly excluding clustering growth as rapid as @xmath65 .",
    "the large size of the errors on our @xmath66 fit does not permit us to make a detailed investigation of the dependence of @xmath51 with sample selection .",
    "however , it is interesting that we find the rate of clustering growth to be slowest for our @xmath67- selected survey , and that our results are broadly consistent with those from the @xmath67- selected sample of .",
    "we expect our @xmath67- selected galaxies to be good tracers of the underlying matter",
    ". @xmath68- body simulations @xcite have shown that in a low - density universe , the clustering of matter is expected to evolve as @xmath69 .",
    "our finding that @xmath70 , is in agreement with the expectations from biased models of galaxy formation , which find that at the @xmath71  mpc scales we are sensitive to , clustering growth is relatively rapid ( figure 1 . of ; ) . in comparison , at larger scales ( @xmath72  mpc )",
    "the correlation function evolves much more slowly . at such separations ,",
    "the clustering pattern is `` frozen in '' as the galaxies are tracing higher - mass haloes whose clustering evolution is close to @xmath73 . in figure",
    "[ fig : allsca_ev ] we see that that the predictions from the non - zero lambda cosmology fitted to the growth of clustering as observed in the simulation of is consistent with our observations and to the predictions of our @xmath74 model .",
    "the rapid decrease of the co - moving correlation length @xmath21 between @xmath75 and @xmath76 for small haloes of @xmath77km@xmath78 is a prediction of biased models which find faster clustering growth for intrinsically fainter galaxies . even at brighter than @xmath79 our samples",
    "are dominated by @xmath80 galaxies @xcite , unlike the lyman - break galaxies of which higher intrinsic luminosities than this ( the high resolution of s simulation and their adopted halo - finding algorithm makes it possible to locate haloes within haloes and therefore to successfully match the halo correlation function with the apm galaxy correlation function @xcite .",
    "for this reason we assume an approximate correspondence between these haloes and the intrinsically fainter galaxies which dominate our samples at @xmath2 . )",
    "figure  [ fig : allsca_ev ] indicates that our observations are consistent with models displaying the non - monotonic dip in the @xmath81 relation , and illustrates why the `` epsilon '' models have been so successful in describing the observed scaling relation of @xmath6 . if our models are correct , even to @xmath2 the number of higher - redshift ( @xmath82 , more highly clustered galaxies forms only a small fraction of total sample size ( less than @xmath835% ) and this explains why scaling relations in which the galaxy correlation length decreases monotonically @xmath84 can successfully match the observations to @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper we have presented a study of the projected two - point angular correlation function @xmath6 as measured in the whdf and compared our measurements to results obtained from the much smaller north and south hubble deep fields .",
    "the clustering amplitudes determined from the hdf are consistent with those in the whdf , but none of our conclusions depend on our hdf measurements . in interpreting our results ,",
    "we have used redshift distributions from a model which correctly predicts colours , number counts and redshift distributions for the faint galaxy population .",
    "we find that at a fixed separation the amplitude of @xmath6 measured in @xmath7 bandpasses is _ lower _ than the predictions of a low-@xmath85 model not containing luminosity evolution and in which clustering growth is stable in proper co - ordinates . for our @xmath8 selected samples ,",
    "our correlation amplitudes are consistent with predictions from models having a low median redshift ; we also find marginal evidence for a slower growth of clustering in these samples .",
    "if our evolutionary models provide a correct description of the underlying redshift distributions ( and comparisons to available observations at brighter magnitudes suggest they do ) , then our whdf clustering measurements are consistent with a clustering growth @xmath86 on the small scales ( @xmath87  mpc ) which we probe . we have also shown that this result is consistent with prediction of biased galaxy formation models which find faster clustering growth for intrinsically fainter galaxies like those which dominate our deep magnitude - limited surveys",
    "we are able to use these rapid - growth `` epsilon '' models to successfully describe the clustering properties of our samples because the highly - clustered high - redshift galaxy population constitutes only a small fraction of the total galaxies observed in our survey .",
    "finally , our constant correlation amplitude found at @xmath9 is consistent with the expected reduction of cosmological volume element at high redshift and a steeper faint end slope for spiral galaxies , indicating that at these magnitude limits the median redshift of our sample ceases to increase .",
