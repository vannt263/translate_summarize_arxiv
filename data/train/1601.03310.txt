    "<S> in systems where electrons form both dispersive bands and small local spins , we show that changes of the spin configuration can tune the bands through a lifshitz transition , resulting in a continuous metal - insulator transition associated with a progressive change of the fermi surface topology . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to a mott - hubbard and slater pictures , this spin - driven lifshitz transition appears in systems with small electron - electron correlation and large hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this situation is realized in 5@xmath0 distorted perovskites with an half - filled @xmath1 bands such as naoso@xmath2 , where the strong @xmath3 hybridization reduces the local moment , and spin - orbit coupling causes a large renormalization of the electronic mobility . </S>",
    "<S> this weakens the role of electronic correlations and drives the system towards an itinerant magnetic regime which enables spin - fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> metal - to - insulator transitions ( mits ) are one of the most important phenomena in solid - state physics and their fundamental understanding represents an enduring challenge in solid state theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> different mechanisms have been invoked to explain the formation of an insulating regime . </S>",
    "<S> classical examples are realized in 3@xmath0 transition metal oxides ( tmos ) , where the nonconducting state is typically understood within the mott - hubbard model as arising from the competition between strong electron - electron interaction ( @xmath4 ) and the electronic mobility , associated to the ( non - interacting ) bandwidth ( @xmath5 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when moving to the more spatially extended 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 orbitals the @xmath5 increases and the @xmath4 is expected to become smaller , leading to the tendency towards metallicity as in the itinerant magnet srruo@xmath2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to these expectations , recent theory and experiment have revealed that in heavy 5@xmath0 tmos , the enhanced spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) strength  @xcite can lead to the formation of a variety of novel types of quantum states including unexpected insulating regimes  @xcite . in the most representative example , sr@xmath6iro@xmath7 , the concerted action of a strong soc and a moderate @xmath4 leads to the opening of a small spectral gap  @xcite denominated _ relativistic mott _ gap . </S>",
    "<S> other and more rare types of mits have been recently proposed for magnetic relativistic osmium oxides based on the slater mechanism  @xcite , driven by antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order , where the gap is opened by exchange interactions and not by electronic correlation ,  @xcite or lifshitz - like processes  @xcite , involving a rigid change of the fermi surface topology  @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we show that in weakly correlated ( small @xmath4 ) itinerant magnets the combined effect of longitudinal and rotational spin - fluctuations can cause a continuous mit with lifshitz characteristics , fundamentally different from relativistic mott or purely slater insulating states . </S>",
    "<S> the necessary conditions for the onset of this type of spin - driven lifshitz mit are the coexistence of a small @xmath4 , a small local moment and an high degree of orbital hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> this places the system at the border of a magnetic and electronic instability where a lifshitz mit is possible . </S>",
    "<S> this situation can be realized in structurally - distorted , half - filled @xmath8 ( or close to half - filled ) 5@xmath0 oxides such as naoso@xmath2 and cd@xmath6os@xmath6o@xmath9 or iridates . by taking naoso@xmath2 as a prototypical example , </S>",
    "<S> we show that here the balance between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is controlled by the soc : the soc induces a surprisignly large reduction of electronic mobility which renormalizes the @xmath4 and pushes the system into a weakly correlated and magnetically itinerant regime subjected to spin fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at high - temperature naoso@xmath2 is a paramagnetic metal but as temperature decreases the changes of the amplitue and direction of the spins lead to the continuous vanishing of holes and electrons pockets in the fermi surface ( fs ) , that do not involve any substantial modification of the underlying band structure  @xcite , consistent with a lifshitz - type mit .    </S>",
    "<S> experimental observations indicate that naoso@xmath2 undergoes a second - order mit concomitant with the onset of an antiferromagnetic long - range ordering at a nel temperature ( @xmath10 ) of @xmath11 410  k. this behavior is apparently adaptable to a slater mechanism  @xcite . however , the bad - metal behavior observed in a wide intermediate temperature region ( @xmath12 )  @xcite , the curie - weiss behavior of the susceptibility above @xmath10 , and the need of a sizable @xmath4 in density functional theory ( dft ) calculations to open the gap , is in conflict with an authentic slater mechanism  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental properties of naoso@xmath2 have been clearly exposed by jung _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it was shown that the apparent discrepancy between the measured os ordered moment of only 1 @xmath13@xcite and the nominal @xmath8 configuration should be attributable to the large @xmath3 hybridization that effectively reduces the local moment and form an ( electronic and magnetic ) itinerant background  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the authors concluded that the role of soc is modest in this system , also based on the , reasonable , consideration that the @xmath14 associated with a @xmath15 state exhibits a negligible orbital moment , much smaller then the one of partially filled @xmath1 subshells  @xcite . in the following we will show that relativistic effects can be strong even in a quenched orbital moment scenario , and we will explain that the soc is the crucial effect in paving the way for the continuous mit in naoso@xmath2 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> spin - orbit induced renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> _ in the presence of a mit in a tmo , the clarification of the role played by the electronic correlation @xmath4 is a central aspect for the theoretical understanding . </S>",
    "<S> we begin , hence , by studying the effects of @xmath4 and its interplay with the soc for the case of our interest , naoso@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> all calculations were performed using the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite using the dft+@xmath4 method and including relativistic effects ( see supplement ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by computing the dependence of experimentally accessible observables on @xmath4 . as usual , the value of the spectral gap @xmath16 and the magnetic moment @xmath17 are highly sensitive on the choice of @xmath4 , as visualized in figure  [ corr](a ) . for @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> the system is metallic , but for @xmath19 ev naoso@xmath2 exhibits a finite gap that increases linearly with @xmath4 . the experimentally reported low - temperature optical gap , </S>",
    "<S> 0.1  ev  @xcite and the @xmath17 @xmath11 1 @xmath13  @xcite clearly indicate that the optimal value of @xmath4 for naoso@xmath2 should be chosen around @xmath20  ev . at the same time , if we calculate @xmath4 entirely _ ab initio _ within the constrained random phase approximation ( crpa )  @xcite , neglecting all relativistic effects ( soc=0 ) , we obtain @xmath21  ev , a value similar to the one used in previous studies ( i.e. , @xmath22 ev  @xcite ) . as we demonstrate here , the root of this apparent controversy lays in the suprising `` competition '' between soc and electronic correlation .     as a function of the soc strength for naoso@xmath2 and other reference systems . </S>",
    "<S> the measured data of the electron mobility are taken from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( naoso@xmath2 ) , ref . </S>",

    "<S> , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we study the interplay between soc and correlation by comparing our dft+@xmath4 results with available infrared optical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> one rather general way@xcite to estimate the degree of electronic correlation of a system is to evaluate the reduction of the electronic kinetic energy ( mass renormalization ) due to coulomb repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> this can be quantified by the ratio @xmath23 between the experimentally measured kinetic energy ( @xmath24 ) , determined by integrating over frequency the drude contribution in the optical conductivity @xmath25 and the correpsonding `` non - correlated '' kinetic energy @xmath26 obtained by dft at @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> considering that @xmath25 can be expressed in terms of the plasma frequency , @xmath27 , via @xmath28 , one can rewrite the kinetic energy ratio as : @xmath29    surprisingly , @xmath23 in naoso@xmath30 is dramatically dependent on the soc strength as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ corr](b ) . without soc , one should have classified the system as intermediate - strong correlated with @xmath23 = 0.33 , which is close to fe - pnictide superconductors . as soc </S>",
    "<S> is considered in the dft calculations , however , @xmath26 gets systematically reduced , as the estimated degree of correlation . for a full inclusion of soc ( soc=1 ) </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath23 = 0.76 , a value similar to those of conventional metals like cr . </S>",
    "<S> to our best knowledge , naoso@xmath30 represents the first system where such a strong renormalization of the balance between soc and correlations is reported .    supporting evidence for the importance of soc in naoso@xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> is provided by the computed soc energy , 0.4 ev / os , and by comparing the electronic structure with and without soc ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ corr](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of soc leads to a widening of the band width by about 0.3 ev , a linearization of the band near @xmath31 which yields the formation of a dirac - like feature and , most importantly for the electron mobility , a band flattening near @xmath32 that increases the effective masses and therefore decreases @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by turning on the soc the estimated degree of correlation moves gradually from the border to the mott - physics to the one of conventional metallic systems . </S>",
    "<S> this significant relativistic renormalization clarifies the origin of the abovementioned inconsistencies on the value of @xmath4 in this system . </S>",
    "<S> more quantitatively , by rescaling the crpa value of @xmath33 by the soc - induced renormalization factor  @xcite we obtain @xmath34 ev ( comparable to the soc energy ) which leads to a much better description of the bandgap ( see arrow in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ corr](a ) ) . this smaller value of @xmath4 is also consistent with the @xmath4 proposed for similar compounds like lioso@xmath2 , @xmath35  ev  @xcite and the itinerant magnet srruo@xmath2 , @xmath36 ev  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the analogy with srruo@xmath2 is not limited to the low degree of correlation but also involves the magnetic itinerancy . </S>",
    "<S> although naoso@xmath2 exhibits a high @xmath10=410  k , the effective moment extracted from the the curie - weiss behavior of the high temperature susceptibility , 2.71  @xmath13  @xcite , is much higher than the ground state magnetic moment measured by neutron diffraction , @xmath11 1  @xmath13  @xcite , indicating a large rhodes - wohlfarth ratio and suggestive of an itinerant antiferromagnetic behavior  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this magnetic itinerancy would _ not _ be compatible with a large @xmath4 and is essential to explain the mit in naoso@xmath2 , as discussed below .    </S>",
    "<S> -projected density of states ( dos ) of the ( a ) low - temperature insulating afm ground phase , ( b ) disordered paramagnetic phase ( metallic ) and ( c ) nonmagnetic phase ( metallic ) . </S>",

    "<S> our main results are summarized in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ para ] and [ mit ] . </S>",
    "<S> first , we recall that the resistivity ( @xmath37 ) curve of naoso@xmath2 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ mit](a ) ) shows two anomalies : one at @xmath38  k , corresponding to a sudden increase of @xmath37 , and the second one around @xmath39=30  k ( @xmath40 )  @xcite characterized by a steeper increment . </S>",
    "<S> the region below @xmath39 has a clear insulating - like behavior with a large and rapidly growing @xmath37 , whereas in the intermediate region , @xmath41 , @xmath37 is always smaller then 1 @xmath42 cm and grows more slowly , with a bad - metal / pseudogap behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this hypothesis is supported by the experiments of lo vecchio _ et al . _ showing that the optical conductivity does neither vanish at @xmath10  @xcite nor shows a clear downturn at low frequencies in the intermediate temperature region . </S>",
    "<S> such a peculiar temperature dependence of the conductivity is very unusual for tmos  @xcite , where -in the presence of a mott - hubbard mit- the opposite trend can be observed  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> similar temperature dependence properties were reported , instead , for the narrow - gap semiconductor fesi : at low temperature fesi is a paramagnetic insulator but it develops a pseudogap associated with a bad - metal state as temperature increases  @xcite . this anomalous behavior is explained well by spin fluctuations in the context of the theory of itinerant magnetism elaborated by moriya  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this similarity is of course very inspiring for the identification of the physical mechanisms at play in naoso@xmath2 .        </S>",
    "<S> to substantiate this idea we explore the effect of transverse ( rotational ) and longitudinal spin fluctuations by means of non - collinear fixed spin moment calculations . as a first step , we have simulated the effect of rotational spin fluctuations in the high - temperature spin disordered configuration by performing non - collinear magnetic calculations on large supercells containing 32 os sites starting from randomly rotated os spin moments in a paramagnetic arrangement ( _ i.e. _ , the total magnetic moment is zero ) , by fixing the magnitude of the magnetic moments to the ground state value . the results are summarized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ para ] . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point is the density of states ( dos ) of the reference collinear afm insulating state at @xmath43 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ para](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the paramagnetic dos , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ para](b ) , clearly shows that above @xmath10 the system is an ordinary metal independently on the value of the local magnetic moment . by allowing a full relaxation of the moments the non - collinear paramagnetic state converges to a unrealistic metallic non - spin - polarized state ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ para](c ) ) with entirely quenched local spin moments , similarly to the case of other magnetically itinerant metals like cr and ni  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , longitudinal spin fluctuations induce local moments forming the true realistic high - temperature paramagnetic state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to explain the double anomalies behavior in the resistivity curve at finite temperature ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mit](a ) ) , the effect of both rotational and longitudinal spin fluctuations should be taken into the account . to quantify the amplitude of the moments induced by longitudinal spin fluctuations at finite temperature we employ the phenomenological theory of moriya , as described below  @xcite .    within spin - fluctuation theory </S>",
    "<S> there is a universal relation between the magnitude of the local mean square fluctuating magnetic moment at the transition temperature ( @xmath44 ) and the ground state local moment ( @xmath45 ) expressed by the moriya formula @xmath46 @xcite . by combining the moriya formula with the mohn and wohlfarth approximation  @xcite , which assumes a linear temperature dependence of the local mean square moment amplitude </S>",
    "<S> , we arrive to the following relation between the amplitude of the fluctuating os moment ( @xmath47 ) and temperature : @xmath48using this relation we have conducted a series of calculations with fixed magnetic moments from @xmath49 = 1.2 @xmath13 to 0 @xmath13 to examine the changes of the electronic structure upon temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the results are collected in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mit ] . at @xmath43 ( top panels ) </S>",
    "<S> the system is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a narrow bandgap and an os moment @xmath50=1.17@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> as the temperature increases the resistivity curve shows its first anomaly at @xmath51 0.1 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ mit](a ) ) , corresponding to the closing of the indirect band gap @xmath52 due to longitudinal spin fluctuations that pushes down the conduction band minima at the @xmath53 point ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mit](c ) ) . right above @xmath39 , </S>",
    "<S> the system starts to develop a fs ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ mit](d ) ) and enters a bad - metal state characterized by several hole and electron pockets with a pseudogap ( ps , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mit](e ) ) separating the valence and conduction bands . </S>",
    "<S> this pseudogap ( @xmath54 ) decreases with temperature and finally closes for @xmath55 at about @xmath56 , second anomaly in the resistivity curve indicated by an arrow in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mit](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this second anomaly , due to the rotational magnetic disorder described previously , set the transition to a metallic behavior for @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the entire process is sketched schematically in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> mit](e ) . </S>",
    "<S> + by refining our analyis , and considering the corresponding evolution of the electronic bandstructure ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mit](c ) ) , we finally gain the complete description of the mit in naoso@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the bands changes almost rigidly with temperature and lead to a continuous change of the fs topology in terms of the appearance of progressively larger holes and electrons pockets ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mit](d ) ) : this represents a clear hallmark of a lifshitz transition  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> lifshitz transitions like the one described here are likely to be relevant for other magnetic materials laying at the border between a localized mott picture and a metallic regime such as nis  @xcite , or 5@xmath0 tmos with a close to half - filled @xmath8 configuration like cd@xmath6os@xmath6o@xmath9  @xcite and iridates . </S>",
    "<S> nearly half - filling , in fact , appears to be the optimum balance between a localized ( insulating ) and deloclaized ( metallic ) scenario : a reduced filling is generally associated to strong @xmath4 picture  @xcite ( i.e. @xmath58 ba@xmath6naoso@xmath59 and @xmath60 ba@xmath6caoso@xmath59 are mott - like insulator  @xcite ) , whereas larger occupation increases the degree of metallicity ( i.e. @xmath61 baoso@xmath2 and nairo@xmath2  @xcite ) ; moreover , the nearly @xmath15 state reduces the soc - induced splitting which weaken the tendency towards mott - soc states and is functional for a rigid - band lifshitz mit . also </S>",
    "<S> , structural distortions in 5@xmath0 oxides are an important factor for lifshitz mit as they enables the formation of small local moments that would be otherwise suppressed in undistorted and more strongly hybridized structures  @xcite .    _ conclusions . _ in summary , we have shown that the coexistence between weak electronic correlation and itinerant magnetism can lead to a spin - driven lifshitz mit , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , a magnetically induced continuous reconstruction of the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> for naoso@xmath2 we found that the mit is prompted by transverse and longitudinal fluctuations of the itinerant os moments , and is intimately bound to the soc - driven renormalization of the electronic kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> our study explains the three different regimes observed experimentally : ( i ) at low-@xmath62 naoso@xmath2 is an afm insulator ; ( ii ) at @xmath63 it enters a bad metal regime due to longitudinal spin fluctuations ; finally ( iii ) at @xmath64 rotational spin fluctuations closes the direct pseudogap and the system become a paramagnetic metal . </S>",
    "<S> spin fluctuations and the tunability by doping and pressure of the lifshitz fs reconstruction could give rise to novel magnetic , orbital and superconducting transitions , to be exploited for engeneering tmos based heterostructures . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the surprising role played by the soc in naoso@xmath2 , as well as its `` competitive '' action against correlations -highlighted here for the first time- could radically affect the theoretical description of the relativistic mechanisms controlling the electronic properties of many other oxides .    </S>",
