    "the solar corona exhibits a myriad of transient energy releases over many scales , from large flares down to nanoflares .",
    "the frequency distribution of the energy in these events has been studied extensively @xcite and has been found to be well represented by a power - law of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of events per unit time with energy between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "these distributions are of particular interest as they elucidate the amount of energy available , how often it is released and in which events and form ( thermal or non - thermal ) it predominantly occurs .",
    "the energy release observed in normal - size flares is not sufficient to constantly and consistently heat the corona to the observed few million kelvin .",
    "so the question is then whether this could be achieved by extending the observed flare - like energy releases to smaller scales .",
    "this concept can be expressed in terms of the power - law index of this distribution : if @xmath19 then the smallest events have a high occurrence rate and their energy dominates over larger flares , possibly matching the energy in coronal heating @xcite .",
    "this requires the assumption that these distributions be continuous into the unobservable low - energy range , which is difficult to determine as there are instrumental and selection effects that both cut - off and bias the observed distribution @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous thermal energy in these events may be calculated from @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the electron density , @xmath22 the volume of the emitting thermal plasma , @xmath23 boltzmann s constant , and @xmath24 the temperature .",
    "an estimate of the volume can be obtained by imaging the events , however there can be an overestimate in this observed volume to the true volume by a filling factor @xmath25 to @xmath26 @xcite . in this work",
    "we assume @xmath27 , which will be discussed later .",
    "the temperature and emission measure may be found either directly from the spectrum or by imaging with different wavelength filters .",
    "assuming constant density , the emission measure is related to the density and volume as @xmath28 and so the thermal energy is @xmath29 note that as losses are not taken into account here , the energy going into the thermal plasma will be larger . for the smallest events",
    "this thermal energy has been found using pixelated detectors in euv and soft x - rays , with simultaneous pixel brightenings within some area being registered as an event @xcite .",
    "the area inferred from these , often spatially discontinuous , brightened pixels gives an estimate of the volume , and observations using different filters give temperature and emission measure information .",
    "the events observed in euv are termed `` nano''-flares as they have about @xmath30 times the energy in large flares , the limit of their observability being down to @xmath31  erg @xcite .",
    "parker s hypothetical nanoflare @xcite is an estimate of the basic unit of a localized impulsive burst of energy release , with energies @xmath32  erg , with ensembles of them constituting the observed events .",
    "the thermal energy of these events outside of active regions has been investigated in soft x - rays with _ yohkoh / sxt _",
    "@xcite finding energies of @xmath12  erg per event , and in euv using _ soho / eit _ @xcite and _ trace _ @xcite providing energies between @xmath31 to @xmath33  erg .",
    "small events in active regions , termed `` active region transient brightenings '' , were seen in soft x - rays with _",
    "yohkoh / sxt _ @xcite , with energies between @xmath6 to @xmath34  erg .",
    "all of these studies found the power law index of the frequency distributions to be between @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite investigated the effect of instrumental bias on the different indices from _ soho / eit _ , _ trace _ and _ yohkoh / sxt _ data .",
    "@xcite later pointed out that the discrepancy between power - law indices from different instruments can be due to the effects of least - squares fitting some the of binned histograms .",
    "similar indices were obtained when a maximum likelihood method @xcite was used instead .",
    "the non - thermal hard x - ray emission is assumed to be due to a power - law distribution of electrons emitting hard x - rays via bremsstrahlung in a thick target .",
    "the resulting power - law photon spectrum reflects this electron distribution @xcite allowing the power in these accelerated electrons above a low - energy cut - off @xmath36 ( in kev ) , to be calculated as @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the index and normalization of the photon power - law spectrum ( in units of photon flux ,",
    "s@xmath13 @xmath40 kev@xmath13 ) and @xmath41 is the beta function @xcite . therefore observing the hard x - ray spectrum of these events for various time intervals during each flare",
    "is sufficient to obtain an estimate of the non - thermal energy .",
    "however there is ambiguity in the low - energy cut - off , @xmath36 , because the observed photon spectrum depends only weakly on it , with a resulting flattening of the photon spectrum below @xmath42 not uniquely related to @xmath36 , with @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "uncertainty in @xmath36 results in a larger uncertainty in the power estimate : a factor of 2 increase / decrease in @xmath36 would result in a factor of 8 decrease / increase in the power for flat spectra ( @xmath44 ) or a factor of 64 decrease / increase in the power for steep spectra ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "previous statistical studies of the non - thermal energy in flares used the energy threshold of the instrument as an estimate of @xmath36 , as they did not observe to low enough energies nor had sufficient energy resolution to observe the flattening of the spectrum .",

    "these are active - region phenomena of low c _ goes _ class to below a - class . for the analysis presented here we measure the energy for 16  seconds around the time of peak emission in 6 - 12  kev .",
    "the peak time is only used as it presents the best opportunity to obtain enough counts above background to permit analysis in each event .",
    "given the standard flare time profile of a sharp impulsive rise followed by slower decay phase , this means that this analysis will mainly cover the impulsive phase of these microflares .",
    "the calculation of the thermal energy using equation ( [ eq : therm ] ) requires knowledge of the volume of the thermal source and thermal parameters from the spectrum . imaging these events , and hence estimating the volume of thermal emission , is detailed in  [ sec : vis ] . in  [ sec : ospex ] the spectral fitting of the events is described , obtaining the thermal and non - thermal parameters of these events .",

    "this spatial information encoded in the time - modulation profile is normally reconstructed into an image via techniques such as back projection @xcite .",
    "a recently implemented alternative technique converts the time - modulation profile to complex visibilities before recovering the spatial information @xcite .",
    "each _ rhessi _",
    "visibility is a calibrated measurement of a single fourier component of the source distribution measured at a specific spatial frequency , energy and time range .",
    "the visibilities are the complex quantities obtained from the fitted amplitude and phase of the modulated time profile for a particular roll orientation ( rotational phase ) of an individual rmc .",
    "the resulting set of visibilities for all roll angles and rmcs is a calibrated and compact representation of the original time profile , with little loss of information .",
    "the advantage of using visibilities is twofold .",
    "first , as a smaller data set has to be processed , the image reconstruction from the visibilities is considerably quicker than using the time profile directly .",
    "second , the visibilities are fully calibrated measurements , representing an intermediate step between the modulation profile and imaging , meaning that spatial information can be found directly from the visibilities without having to compute an image . this has been implemented in a visibility forward fit ( vff ) algorithm @xcite which determines the best - fit parameters , with statistical errors , for simple assumed source geometries ( elliptical gaussian , curved elliptical gaussian , multiple sources etc ) .",
    "we are primarily interested in the size of the thermal source , in order to make an estimate of the density and hence thermal energy , see  [ sec : eng ] .",
    "the images of thermal sources in microflares are taken over 4 - 8  kev and generally have a single elliptical source or loop shape .",
    "we fit a 2d model of a curved elliptical gaussian to the 4 - 8  kev visibilities for 16  secs about the peak in 6 - 12  kev for each microflare .",
    "this attempts to fit a gaussian profile along the curved semi - major axis , equivalent to the loop arc length . if the source is not appreciably curved an elliptical geometry of zero curvature is returned .",
    "seven parameters are obtained from each fit of this 2d model : the centroid position ( x , y ) , photon flux , fwhm loop length and width , curvature and position angle of the semi - major .",
    "an example of this fitting is shown in figure [ fig : visfitex ] . here in the left panel",
    "we have the visibility amplitudes , with statistical errors , for each grid and is position angle .",
    "the solid line is the vff model loop shape which has fitted subcollimators 3,4,5,6,8 and 9 well . for this event the finest subcollimator , 1 ,",
    "is dominated by noise and so has little influence on the fit .",
    "subcollimators 2 and 7 are not included as they provide a poor response in this energy range .",
    "the right panel shows the resulting image of these visibilities , produced using the mem njit algorithm @xcite , with the vff model loop from the left panel overplotted as contours .",
    "the contours correspond well with the background image .",

    "such an objective measure of the fit quality is vitally important for an automated analysis project as it is impractical to visually inspect over 25,000 images .",
    "after processing all microflares we have 18,656 microflares to which the model achieved a satisfactory fit and were resolved , i.e. returning spatial sizes larger than the instrumental resolution , 2.3 \" .",
    "the majority of events producing poor fits were those that had the fewest counts .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : histrate48 ] where the histogram of the 4 - 8  kev count rate per detector of all the microflares is shown , as well as for the subsets of events producing good and bad fits .",
    "there are some microflares with large count rates but poor fits .",
    "this is likely due to an instrumental issue , such as to an absence of spacecraft roll information .",
    "the histograms of the loop fwhm arc length @xmath50 and width @xmath51 ( at loop mid - point ) for the events with good vffs are shown in figure [ fig : histlwv ] .",
    "we find that the median fwhm loop arc length is @xmath52 ( 23  mm ) and width is @xmath53 ( 8  mm ) .",
    "the lengths distribution has a sharp peak , symmetrical in log - space , away from the resolution limit .",
    "the histogram of the ratio of the loop arc length to width ( middle panel of figure [ fig : histlwv ] ) shows that the majority of the microflare thermal sources are elongated structures , with the median value of the arc length being 3 times the loop width .",
    "the size of these loops shows no correlation with the magnitude of the flare , either the flux in the loop or the background subtracted goes class ( figure [ fig : lenvsmag ] ) .",
    "this shows that small flares are not necessarily spatially small , which is certainly the case for the examples shown in figures [ fig : visfitex ] and [ fig : imgexam ] .",

    "the histogram of the loop volume for the good events is shown in the right panel in figure [ fig : histlwv ] .",
    "the median volume is about @xmath55 , which is a factor of @xmath5666 larger than the minimum measurable volume of @xmath57 , found by taking @xmath58 in equation ( [ eq : vol ] ) .",

    "since unmodulated background does not affect the visibilities this flux measure is intrinsically background - subtracted as it is the emission from only the loop . in figure",
    "[ fig : histph48 ] we have the differential frequency distribution of this 4 - 8  kev photon flux .",
    "this distribution covers a range of 5 to 5000 photons  s@xmath13  @xmath40  kev@xmath13 and power - law parameters were found using a maximum likelihood method @xcite .",
    "this technique uses the standard statistical procedure of the maximum likelihood estimation to fit a skew - laplace distribution to the data .",
    "this distribution consists of a broken power - law ; the index above the break is the true distribution , whereas below it the power - law fits the flattening / turning - over of the distribution from under - sampling the smallest events .",
    "so from a simple calculation on the sample ( in this case 4 - 8 kev fluxes ) an objective measure is obtained of the power - law index above a break ( with errors found from the 95% sample confidence ) instead of subjectively choosing bin sizes before line fitting a histogram .",
    "for simplicity the resulting fit is shown overplotted to a standard histogram in figure [ fig : histph48 ] . over two orders of magnitude",
    "the power - law index is @xmath59 .",
    "this is steeper than the index of @xmath60 found for hard x - rays @xmath46  kev @xcite but flatter than the that found for soft x - rays , 1.7  2.1 @xcite .",
    "the distribution in figure [ fig : histph48 ] deviates from a power - law at both low and high fluxes due to instrumental selection effects .",
    "the events with the smallest and largest fluxes are missing as we are unable to successfully analyze these events : the smallest are hard to observe above background and the largest have excessive counts causing high detector deadtime or are excluded from our microflare list as _",

    "+       +     +    another way in which we can use this _ rhessi _ 4 - 8  kev thermal flux is by comparing it to the emission observed by _ goes _ in its 1 - 8   band ( figure [ fig : goesvsph48 ] ) .",
    "here we see that there is a power - law correlation , with index close to one , although there is some spread about the fitted line .",
    "this suggests that _ rhessi _ and _ goes _ are observing the emission from the same thermal plasma with the different temperature distribution from event to event accounting for the spread in the correlation . in comparison to _ rhessi",

    "the spectrum of each microflare is determined over the same time period as the visibilities in  [ sec : vis ] , 16 seconds around the time of peak emission in 6 - 12  kev .",
    "these spectra are made with @xmath62  kev energy bins between 3  kev to 30  kev using detectors 1,3,4,5,8 and 9 .",
    "for each microflare , a background interval before and after the event were determined automatically with the selection of these background times described in part i of this paper @xcite .",

    "this indicates that the thermal component for more microflares can be obtained than the non - thermal component .",
    "this does not mean that many microflares do not have a non - thermal component , just that we can not distinguish it from the background in these cases .",
    "these background - subtracted observed count spectra are forward - fitted with a model in photon space converted back to count space using the full _ rhessi _ detector response matrix @xcite in the ospex software package , an updated version of the spex code @xcite .",
    "the model has both a thermal and non - thermal component so that we can recover the respective parameters to calculate the energy in both the heated and accelerated electrons .",

    "although this numerical integration provides an accurate representation of the non - thermal emission it is too slow to compute in this fitting procedure , requiring multiple iterations per microflare , with tens of thousands of microflares to fit . instead the non - thermal component is fitted with a broken power - law , which has an index of @xmath63 above the break energy of @xmath42 and a fixed index of @xmath64 below the break .",
    "an example of this approximation to the numerical integration is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : thick2bpow ] and the relationship between these two models is detailed further in  [ sec : nonthermpow ] , as it is important for calculating the power in the non - thermal electrons via equation ( [ eq : pow ] ) .",
    "the fit to each microflare spectrum is conducted using the following strategy .",
    "first the thermal parameters are varied to fit the spectrum over 4 - 8  kev , where the thermal emission normally dominates . then the fit is repeated but the non - thermal parameters are allowed to vary , while keeping the previously found thermal parameters fixed , to fit the spectrum from 10  kev up to either 30  kev or to where the background dominates over the flare signal .",
    "the fit is repeated a final time allowing all the fit parameters to vary to fit the spectrum from 3  kev up to either 30  kev or to where the background dominates over the flare signal .",

    "looking over larger ranges with different instruments helps to reduce the overall influence of the selection effects but there is still ambiguity as to how these parameters scale .    to gain a better understanding of the _ rhessi _ temperature and emission measure , we have also calculated the _ goes _ temperatures and emission measures for each of these microflares .",
    "this was done using the same pre - flare time for background and peak time of emission in 6 - 12  kev as was used in the _ rhessi _ analysis .",
    "this was possible for 6,740 microflares , removing those events for which a _ goes _ temperature and emission measure were not reliably calculable .",
    "the resulting correlation plots are shown in figure  [ fig : goesvsrhessi ] .",

    "again there is a hint of a correlation between the _ rhessi _ temperature and _ goes _ flux for the events above b - class ( @xmath94 ) , but it is obscured in smaller events again due to the temperature selection effect .",

    "a similar correlation was found in the @xcite study using the flux at 35  kev for the non - thermal flux , since larger flares were also analyzed , finding @xmath102 .",

    "the thermal and non - thermal emission correlate , with the fit being @xmath106 , but with a greater scatter in the smaller events . at higher fluxes",
    "the correlation steepens , suggesting that there might a greater proportion of non - thermal emission relative to thermal emission in larger flares .",
    "however , this may just be an instrumental effect , arising from detector pileup and livetime issues in these larger events prior to the shutters deploying .",
    "+     +      using the volumes found in  [ sec : vis ] and temperature and emission measure found in  [ sec : ospex ] the thermal energy @xmath107 , over the time of peak emission in 6 - 12  kev , can be calculated via equation ( [ eq : therm ] ) .",
    "the energies range from @xmath6  erg to @xmath7  erg with the median being about @xmath8  erg .",
    "the frequency distribution ( number of events per energy bin range , area of solar disk and duration of observation period ) of this energy for 9,161 microflares is shown in figure  [ fig : thermdist ] .",
    "the resulting _ rhessi _ thermal energy distribution is not a clear power - law ; it has a turn - over at low energies and steepens at higher energies .",
    "these features are instrumental effects due to missing the smallest events , with insufficient counts to either find the events or successfully analyze them , and the largest events , due to detector livetime issues before the attenuating shutters come in .",
    "considerably more small events are missing than large , since the discrepancy from a power - law is greater at lower energies than high .",
    "as this distribution deviates from a power - law it will not be fitted to obtain the power - law index @xmath108 .",
    "instead , figure [ fig : thermdist ] , shows an @xmath109 line , indicating the parts of the _ rhessi _ thermal distribution can be steeper and flatter , or larger and smaller , than @xmath109 .    compared to the previous distributions found for euv nanoflares @xcite and soft x - ray active - region transient brightenings @xcite , the _ rhessi _ energy distribution appears as an extension to these at higher energies",
    "this is both remarkable and deceptive since these distributions were found for very different types of events , using various instruments and for different periods during the solar cycle .",
    "for instance the _ sxt _ energies @xcite are from 291 brightenings in one active region over 5 days in august 1992 , whereas the _ eit _ @xcite and _ trace _ euv quiet sun observation @xcite were found over about an hour each on 12 july 1996 , 17 february 1998 and 16 june 1998 respectively .",
    "so there are two key issues that have to be taken into account when looking at the energy distributions in figure  [ fig : thermdist ] .",
    "first , various instruments were used , so different components of the thermal energy will be observed and with distinctive instrumental selection effects will influence each distribution .",
    "this makes it difficult to determine whether these are similar events or completely distinctive physical processes .",
    "second , the distributions cover different phases of the solar cycle .",
    "the previous studies show a snapshot of the energy distribution of different small energy release features in the solar corona whereas the _ rhessi _ microflare energy distribution represents 5 years of observations of the declining phase of the solar cycle .",
    "the difficulty here lies in determining whether these snapshot surveys demonstrate typical or unusual behavior . using the _ rhessi _ thermal energies we can investigate how the energy distribution changes with time by plotting the distributions for each year separately , as shown in figure  [ fig : thermdistpy ] .",
    "these distributions have similar shapes except that the normalization decreases by over an order of magnitude between 2002 and 2006 .",
    "so the non-_rhessi _ distributions in figure  [ fig : thermdist ] could be shifted vertically by a considerable amount if they were found during a different part of the solar cycle .",
    "this invariance in the shape of the distribution during the solar cycle has been found previously in both soft @xcite and hard @xcite x - rays , and also illustrates that the selection effects on the rhessi data do not vary with time .       +      to calculate the power in accelerated electrons from the information about the power - law in the photon spectrum , we use @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( the power - law index and normalization ) , found in  [ sec : ospex ] , in equation ( [ eq : pow ] )",
    ". however there is ambiguity as to the low - energy cut - off @xmath36 because the observed photon spectrum depends only weakly on it .",
    "in addition the _ rhessi _ microflare spectrum covers both the thermal and non - thermal energy ranges and so there is inherent ambiguity .",
    "previous studies used their x - ray threshold for @xmath36 resulting in large uncertainties in the energy estimates @xcite . as _",
    "rhessi _ makes spectral measurements down to the thermal component we can provide a better estimate of the non - thermal energy content . in part",
    "i of these papers a fixed @xmath36 was used to provide a rough estimate of the non - thermal power at peak time @xcite .",
    "the full spectrum fitting in  [ sec : ospex ] provides a better estimate of the parameters required to calculate the non - thermal power via equation ( [ eq : pow ] ) .",
    "however , despite this improvement we only have an estimate of where the photon spectrum begins to flatten @xmath110 and not the actual cut - off in the electron distribution @xmath36 .    to obtain an estimate of @xmath36",
    "we have therefore investigated how the fitted broken power - law model relates to the expected photon spectrum from the electron distribution using the numerical integration code of @xcite .",
    "an example of this is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : thick2bpow ] , where the photon spectrum for an electron distribution with @xmath111 and @xmath36 was calculated and then fitted with a broken power - law in the same manner as was used for the microflare spectrum .",
    "this broken power - law has @xmath112 , expected as @xmath113 @xcite , above a break of @xmath114  kev . repeating this process for various values of the electron distribution parameters @xmath115 and @xmath36 ,",
    "shows how the resulting fitted @xmath42 scales with these parameters .",
    "this is shown in the middle panel in figure  [ fig : thick2bpow ] , where @xmath42 is given against @xmath36 for three different values of @xmath115 . for a single value of @xmath115",
    ", @xmath36 approximately scales linearly with @xmath42 and this scaling steepens with increasing @xmath115 .",
    "so we can approximate this relationship to first order by linearly fitting the relationship between @xmath42 and @xmath36 for various @xmath115 and then linearly fitting how the parameters of the first fit vary with @xmath115 .",
    "this empirical relationship between the observed parameters of the photon power - law @xmath116 and the low energy cut - off of the electron distribution @xmath36 can be found : @xmath117 using equation ( [ eq : ec ] ) the values of @xmath38 and @xmath42 for the 4,236 microflares with trustworthy non - thermal spectral fits result in a histogram of @xmath36 for these events , shown in the right panel in figure  [ fig : thick2bpow ] .",
    "the low energy cut - offs range from 9 to 16  kev with the median being about 12  kev , with generally @xmath118 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath36 can be seen in the average ratio of the error ( found from the fit errors in @xmath38 and @xmath42 ) to @xmath36 also shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : thick2bpow ] . for @xmath119 kev , where the major of the event lie",
    ", the uncertainty is about @xmath14 and drops to about @xmath120 for the few events with larger @xmath36 .",
    "these values of @xmath36 can then be used in equation ( [ eq : pow ] ) to calculate the power in non - thermal electrons above @xmath36 , @xmath121 , the frequency distribution of which is shown in the left panel in figure [ fig : nnthdist ] . here the power ranges over @xmath12 to @xmath8  erg  s@xmath13 with the median being about @xmath6  erg  s@xmath13 .",
    "also shown is the ratio of the error to the power , as a function of the power .",
    "the few microflares which show a power of around @xmath8  erg  s@xmath13 have the smallest errors with uncertainties about @xmath14 .",
    "these powers seem relatively high for small flares , as the _ rhessi _ power estimates in large flares are @xmath33 to @xmath7  erg  s@xmath13 @xcite , though it should be noted that the non - thermal emission in microflares lasts for @xmath122 seconds whereas it can last for tens of minutes in large flares .",
    "the total non - thermal energy content in large flares is many orders of magnitude larger than in microflares .",
    "the majority of the microflares shown in figure [ fig : nnthdist ] show non - thermal powers considerably smaller than this level , although with increasing uncertainty .",
    "the median power of @xmath6  erg  s@xmath13 has about a @xmath123 error and the smallest events at @xmath12  erg  s@xmath13 have almost @xmath124 error .",
    "it is this large uncertainty in the power that results in this distribution deviating from a power - law . although the selection effects and biases will affect this non - thermal distribution as seen in the thermal distribution , these effects are hidden by the large uncertainties .",
    "since it deviates from a power - law , it has not been fitted using this model .    to allow comparison to the power distribution in electrons above 25  kev @xmath125 for 2,878 large flares found over 1980 to 1982 using _",
    "smm / hxrbs _ @xcite the same power is estimated in the _ rhessi _ microflares , shown in the right panel in figure [ fig : nnthdist ] .",
    "these powers using @xmath126 kev for the _ rhessi _ microflare ranges over @xmath127 to @xmath33  erg  s@xmath13 with the median power being about @xmath31  erg  s@xmath13 . on this basis",
    "the _ rhessi _ microflares cover events down to two orders of magnitude smaller than those in the _ smm / hxrbs _ study .",
    "again the error is smallest in the largest power estimates .",
    "this @xmath125 _ rhessi _ distribution deviates less from a power - law than the @xmath128 distribution .",
    "this is because there is less uncertainty in the power estimate in the larger events as the fixed @xmath126 kev has no associated error .",
    "we have analyzed 25,705 microflares , successfully recovering trustworthy spatial information about the thermal emission for 18,656 of them , as well as the thermal spectral fit in 9,161 and the thermal and non - thermal fit in 4,236 .",
    "the median values and ranges of each of the microflare parameters are summarized in table  [ table ] .",
    "as found in part i @xcite the microflares occur only in active regions and this immediately suggests that these events are ill - suited to heat the overall corona .",
    "it also helps to show that the x - ray emission outside active regions , especially during periods of quiet sun , is considerably smaller than the smallest active - region flares observed with _ rhessi_. this is confirmed by the _ rhessi _",
    "quiet sun study @xcite which found a limit on the flux over two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the smallest microflares found here .",
    "+    forwarding - fitting the visibilities of _ rhessi _ data is a fast and efficient way to recover the spatial information @xcite . we find that the thermal emission ( 4 - 8  kev ) of the microflares shows predominantly loop - like structures that have a median width of 11@xmath0 and 32@xmath0 length .",
    "those events where no spatial information was recoverable were predominantly those with the fewest counts , although some larger events produce poor spatial information as there were other instrumental issues .",
    "these spatial scales do not correlate with the magnitude of the microflare , the 4 - 8 kev flux from the loop nor the goes class , and so small flares are not necessarily spatially small",
    ". this may be due to the prevalence of a typical loop scale size associated with active regions , and it is independent of the amount of energy the flare has deposited into heating the material that evaporates to fill these loops . in the largest flares",
    "this energy might be deposited over a larger area , evaporating material into more loops , hence the larger structures and arcades that are observed .",
    "the widths of these loops may not be as well resolved as the lengths , with the observed single _",
    "loop possibly being several narrow and long loops beside each other , as observed in microflare with _",
    "rhessi _ and _ hinode / xrt _ @xcite .",
    "the volume of these loops can be estimated , the median value being @xmath129 .",
    "this volume estimate assumes a cylindrical geometry and filling factor of unity , meaning that our volumes , and hence thermal energies , are upper limits , as this filling factor can be @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "we find that microflares are hot , with a median temperature of 13  mk .",
    "in these microflares the median emission measure is @xmath131 , which combined with the volume allows a density of @xmath132 to be calculated .",
    "as the volume may be an overestimate , this means that the density might be underestimated .",
    "the presence of the spectral feature due to the fe k - shell transitions proves that there really is hot plasma present with @xmath133  mk @xcite .",
    "correlations between the temperature and other parameters are difficult to extract from our sample due to the temperature selection effect , resulting in only a relative narrow range of temperatures being sampled .",
    "studying larger flares would aid by extending the range of flare temperatures , but this would be complicated by systematic effects related to _ rhessi _",
    "s attenuating shutters . an alternative would be to investigate this selection effect by comparing model spectra for known temperatures and emission measures with those found by fitting this spectrum once noise and the instrumental response have been included",
    ". this has already been attempted for the _ trace _ nanoflares study @xcite , and it revealed a difference between the observed parameters and the `` intrinsic '' ones .",
    "another way of investigating the instrumental response and biases is in comparison to results from other instruments .",
    "we have found that the _ goes _ emission measures are typically a factor of 2 larger than those found with _",
    "rhessi_. this maybe due to the underlying dem in microflares scaling similarly but might also be due to the instrument s relative sensitivity .",
    "this could be further studied by forward - fit modeling of the instrumental responses to recover the underlying dem in each event @xcite , instead of assuming a constant emission measure .",
    "the thermal energies for the peak time in these microflares were found to range from @xmath6  erg to @xmath7  erg with the median energy being @xmath8  erg .",
    "the thermal energy distribution deviates from a power - law at low and high energies but this can be explained by selection effects and does not suggest that the underlying true distribution is not power - law .",
    "the smallest events are missing as they do not have enough counts to be found either above solar or instrumental background , successfully imaged or spectrally analyzed .",
    "the larger events are missing from the distribution due to _ rhessi _ s attenuating shutters , so either they are exclude from our selection or have poor detector livetime .",
    "although it is possible to extend this energy distribution to higher energies by analyzing all large flares observed with _ rhessi _ , there will still be a strong instrumental effect at the shutter transition due to detector livetime effects .",
    "the statistical errors in the fitted parameters will affect the thermal energy estimates but these have a relatively small effect compared to the selection effects .",
    "the greatest uncertainty is the systematic error that arises from the filling factor used to estimate the thermal volume : taking an extreme filling factor of @xmath134 @xcite would have the effect of reducing the energies by a factor of 100",
    ". therefore the thermal energies quoted here about the time of peak emission in 6 - 12 kev are upper limits .",
    "the comparison of the _ rhessi _ thermal distribution to other the thermal distributions of other transient coronal energy releases is difficult as these events are from a limited sample of events over a very short time period .    with _ rhessi",
    "_ we are able to investigate the flattening of the non - thermal photon spectrum and can empirically estimate the low energy cut - off @xmath36 in the electron distribution from the observed photon spectrum .",
    "however we are only able to successfully fit the non - thermal spectral component , in addition to the thermal component , in 4,236 events .",
    "the difficultly in successfully finding and fitting this non - thermal emission arises from the steep spectra that start close to the thermal spectral features about 7  kev .",
    "so , although the non - thermal component was only successfully fitted in a minority of events , it does not mean that there is a lack of accelerated electrons in the others .",
    "it does mean however that the relatively large uncertainties in the non - thermal parameters will result in large uncertainties in @xmath36 and the non - thermal power estimates .",
    "these large uncertainties and the biases introduced by rejecting many events due to poor spectra fits can be easily seen in the histograms of the non - thermal parameters @xmath38 and @xmath42 .",
    "we find that the microflares typically have non - thermal emission represented by a broken power - law with index @xmath45 , break at 9  kev .",
    "we can estimate @xmath135  kev , for breaks in the photon spectrum above 7  kev .",
    "these non - thermal parameters were used to calculate the power in accelerated electrons above @xmath36 , which range over @xmath12 to @xmath8  erg  s@xmath13 with a median value of @xmath6  erg  s@xmath13 .",
    "this distribution again deviates from a power - law at low and high energies due to the uncertainties in the power estimates and the rejected events due to poor spectra fits rather than the selection effects present in the thermal distribution .",
    "the uncertainties in the few events with the largest non - thermal component are only @xmath136 and so this can not explain the fact that in some of these small flares the rate of energy release is comparable to larger flares , @xmath33 to @xmath7  erg  s@xmath13 @xcite . however",
    "the non - thermal emission in microflares lasts for only @xmath122s seconds whereas it can last for tens of minutes in large flares .",
    "the non - thermal energy content in large flares is thus many orders of magnitude larger than in microflares . to make a direct comparison of these _ rhessi _ microflare results to the peak non - thermal power distribution found for large flares by @xcite , the same instrumental @xmath126 kev has to be used . on this basis",
    "the _ rhessi _ microflare peak powers extend to two orders of magnitude smaller than the @xcite study .",
    "the true non - thermal power in the @xcite flares can not be determined as the spectrum was not observed to sufficiently low energies and so that study could have easily under - estimated the non - thermal energy content .",

    "unfortunately for the microflares , this gives an even lower cut - off at around 45 kev , which results in a even larger non - thermal power estimate .",
    "nevertheless the idea of the non - thermal electron distribution smoothly transitioning into the thermal distribution seems physically more realistic than a sharp low energy cut - off and may provide a clue to the physics of the energization of the electron distribution function .",
    "another change to the model of the hard x - ray emission would be the inclusion of free - bound emissions @xcite , as our models currently only assume free - free continuum .",
    "microflares might be the ideal type of flares to study this seldom - considered mechanism as the resulting additional spectral features would occur above @xmath158 kev and would likely have been hidden by the thermal component in large flares .",

    "the analysis presented here is only performed at the time of peak 6 - 12  kev emission even though the most desirable results would investigate the full time range of each microflare , producing the total thermal and non - thermal energy estimates . but as this paper has shown , it is a considerable undertaking just analyzing this peak time period .",
    "the next steps in this microflare study would be to investigate the biases and instrumental effects using simulations and making improvements to the forward - fit model of the emission .",
    "although _ rhessi _ has for the first time allowed the thermal energy and non - thermal power distributions to be studied systematically in microflares , the uncertainty in the transition between thermal and non - thermal components highlights the instrumental effects and biases .",

    "<S> each microflare is automatically analyzed at the peak time of the 6 - 12  kev emission : the thermal source size is found by forward - fitting the complex visibilities for 4 - 8 kev , and the spectral parameters ( temperature , emission measure , power - law index ) are found by forward fitting a thermal plus non - thermal model . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of these parameters allows us to present the first statistical analysis of the thermal and non - thermal energy at the peak times of microflares . on average a _ rhessi _ microflare has a fitted thermal loop width 8 mm ( 11@xmath0 ) , length 23 mm ( 32@xmath0 ) and volume @xmath1  @xmath2 , temperature 13  mk , emission measure @xmath3  @xmath4 and density of @xmath5  @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> there is no correlation between the loop size and the flare magnitude , either flux in the loop or goes class , indicating that microflares are not necessarily spatially small . </S>",
    "<S> there is also no clear correlation between the thermal parameters except between the _ rhessi _ and _ goes _ emission measures , the _ goes _ values are generally twice the _ rhessi _ emission measures . the microflare thermal energy at the time of peak emission in 6 - 12  kev ranges over @xmath6 to @xmath7  erg and has a median value of @xmath8  erg . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency distribution of the thermal energy deviates from a power - law at low and high energies arising from a deficiency of events due to instrumental and selection effects . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to compare this energy distribution to previous thermal energy distributions of transient events , as the work sought nanoflares through imaging in euv or soft x - rays and covered just a few hours . </S>",
    "<S> there are large uncertainties in the majority of the non - thermal parameters , due to the steep spectra down to low energies . </S>",
    "<S> we typically find a power - law index of @xmath9 above a break energy of @xmath10  kev , which corresponds to a low - energy cut - off in the electron distribution as low as @xmath11  kev . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting non - thermal power estimates , covering @xmath12 to @xmath8  erg  s@xmath13 with median value of @xmath6  erg  s@xmath13 , therefore have large uncertainties as well . </S>",
    "<S> the few microflares with unexpectedly large non - thermal powers @xmath8  erg  s@xmath13 have the smallest uncertainties , of about @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the total non - thermal energy however is still small compared to that of large flares as it occurs for shorter durations . </S>"
