    "the number of annually published papers devoted to the models of disordered systems , has noticeably increased during the last decade , the \" center of gravity  of up to date research is shifting towards _ correlated _ disordered systems , exploration of which becomes more and more popular @xcite . in the historically first models of random systems , as a rule , the @xmath0-correlated random potential was employed and relatively small attention was paid to the influence of correlations .",
    "the recent research have shown , that correlations can lead to a considerable ( sometimes , qualitative ) modification of energy structure and localisation properties of disordered systems .",
    "the exactly solvable models play an important role in an arbitrary field of theoretical physics .",
    "exactly solvable model allows one to accumulate the qualitative information related to the appropriate class of models with a high degree of reliability , to test used approximations , to specify a direction of further research , etc .",
    "the most known and important exactly solvable models in physics of disordered systems are dyson model @xcite and lloyd model @xcite .",
    "both these models relate to the uncorrelated disorder . in this paper",
    "we propose a generalized one - dimensional lloyd model , with _",
    "site energies being not an independent random variables _ and describe the exact calculation of the averaged green s function , and show , that it does not depend on the model s parameter which plays the role of correlation radius .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the first section we consider the classical lloyd model ,",
    "formulate definitions , necessary for further analysis and obtain some auxiliary results . in the second section",
    "we introduce the correlated disorder , for which the exact evaluation of the averaged green s function is carried out in the third section .",
    "matrix @xmath1 of the hamiltonian of classical one - dimensional lloyd model has the following elements : @xmath2 where function @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 is specified , and diagonal elements ( the site energies ) @xmath5 are independent , similarly distributed random variables with cauchy distribution function @xmath6 parameter @xmath7 characterizes a degree of disorder  at @xmath8",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 1a ] ) corresponds to ordered ( crystalline ) system and can be diagonalised in the representation of plane waves . a set of numbered site energies",
    "is frequently referred to as a random potential .    in his famous work @xcite lloyd",
    "has managed to calculate exactly the averaged green s function @xmath9 ^ { -1 } \\rangle $ ] , ( @xmath10 ) for a model system ( [ 1a ] ) , ( [ coch ] ) , which ( green function ) allows one to calculate density of states and spectrum of linear susceptibility . in this section",
    "we reproduce lloyd s result by means of a dyagram technique , similar to that offered in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let s introduce a matrix @xmath11 with elements @xmath12 .",
    "then the green s function matrix @xmath13 can be written as the following series @xcite @xmath14 let s denote matrix element @xmath15 by an arrow , directed from site @xmath16 to site @xmath17 and denote factor @xmath18 ^ { -1 } $ ] , related to the site @xmath16 , by a bold dot , placed inside the appropriate site .",
    "the examples are presenteded at fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "then one can write the following expression for the matrix element @xmath19 of the green s function @xmath20 to calculate the sought averaged green s function one should integrate ( [ 4a ] ) with a joint distribution function of site energies @xmath21 . in the case of uncorrelated disorder",
    "this function can be represented as a product : @xmath22 for lloyd model under consideration the function @xmath23 has the form ( [ coch ] ) .",
    "averaging of an arbitrary diagram @xmath24 in expansion ( [ 4a ] ) , is reduced to averaging of factor @xmath25 defined as : @xmath26 where @xmath27  are the numbers of sites , the diagram @xmath28 passed through , and @xmath29 is the number of diagram s passages through the site @xmath30 ( number of bold dots inside the site @xmath31 ) . for example , for upper diagram at fig.[fig1 ] we have : @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the key point for lloyd s solution is the following rule for calculating of relevant integrals @xmath34 taking advantage of this relationship and implying the site energies @xmath35 to be mutually independent , we obtain the following expression for the averaged factor @xmath25 : @xmath36 @xmath37 which is coincides with that for a diagram @xmath28 of the green s function of the _ ordered _ system with all site energies being zero , and with energy argument being replaced as : @xmath38 .",
    "the above calculation is valid for any diagram in expansion ( [ 4a ] ) and we come to the lloyd s result : _ the averaged green function of disordered system described by the hamiltonian ( [ 1a ] ) with the cauchy uncorrelated disorder ( [ coch ] ) is equal to a green s function @xmath39 of the ordered system with zero site energies , and in which the replacement @xmath40 of energy argument is made _ : @xmath41 the explicit expression for a green s function matrix of ordered ( and cyclic ) system @xmath39 can be obtained by using the fact that eigenvectors of the hamiltonian ( [ 1a ] ) at @xmath42 are plane waves @xcite . for the case of one - dimensional system",
    "this matrix is : @xmath43    in the next section we describe the simple correlated discrete random process @xmath44 , for which the total joint distribution function @xmath45 ( which can not be reduced to the product like ( [ 5a ] ) ) can be calculated in the close form . in the final , third , section",
    "we show , that for the random hamiltonian ( [ 1a ] ) , with site energies represented by such random process , the result ( [ 9a ] ) holds .",
    "we obtain the correlated sequence of site energies @xmath46 by the following procedure _ of smoothing _",
    "let s introduce a set of independent random values @xmath47 , each of which has the specified distribution function @xmath48 ( at this stage of calculation it can differ from ( [ coch ] ) ) , independent on @xmath49 .",
    "now obtain the site energies @xmath50 as a realisation of the following discrete random process : @xmath51 the values @xmath50 will be correlated with a correlation radius @xmath52 .",
    "the relevant correlation function @xmath53 has the form @xmath54 \\label { 12a}\\ ] ] from definition ( [ 11a ] ) it is easy to obtain the following ( important for the further ) relationship : @xmath55 the correlation function ( [ 12a ] ) is meaningful only for the case of finite second moment of the function @xmath48 and is not exist if @xmath48 has the form ( [ coch ] ) . nevertheless , even in this case it is not correct to consider a sequence ( [ 11a ] ) as uncorrelated , because , as we shall see below , its joint distribution function can not be presented in the form ( [ 5a ] ) . at last , we note , that the correlated sequence ( [ 11a ] ) is causal ",
    "i.e. @xmath50 depends only on those @xmath56 , for which @xmath57 .",
    "the distribution function of an arbitrary site energy @xmath50 ( we shall denote it @xmath58 ) does not depend on its number @xmath59 and we calculate it for @xmath60 @xcite . as a starting point",

    "for this purpose we shall introduce the joint probability distribution functions of the first @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) site energies @xmath72 .",

    "our task now is to calculate the averaged green s function of disordered model described by the hamiltonian @xmath88 , with site energies representing the realisation of correlated random process ( [ 11a ] ) .",
    "let s consider , as well as in the first section , an arbitrary diagram @xmath28 , passing through the sites @xmath89 , whose numbers without loss of generality we can consider to be arranged in ascending order : @xmath90 .",
    "the average value @xmath91 of factor ( [ 6a ] ) of the diagram under consideration is now defined by a formula , differed from ( [ 8a ] ) : @xmath92 where function @xmath93 for our correlated lloyd model has the form ( [ 21 ] ) . as @xmath94 ,",
    "the factors in big brackets in the relationship ( [ 22 ] ) , considered as a functions of complex @xmath95 , _ have no singularities in a lower half - plane of complex _ @xmath95 .",
    "this allows us to use formula ( [ 7a ] ) for evaluation of integrals figuring in the formula ( [ 22 ] ) as follows .",
    "first of all let s integrate the relationship ( [ 22 ] ) over all @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",
    "after that the function ( [ 21 ] ) , entering this relationship , will lose its first @xmath98 factors of a type @xmath99 and denominator @xmath100 ^ { n-1 } $ ] will be replaced by @xmath100 ^ { n_q-1 } $ ] . then perform the integration over @xmath101 , which affects only the lorentzian @xmath102 , entering ( [ 21 ] ) , and",
    "can be carried out with the help of formula ( [ 7a ] ) .",
    "this formula shows that mentioned integration corresponds to multiplication by the factor @xmath103 and to replacement @xmath104 in the factor @xmath105 , entering the integrand in ( [ 22 ] ) .",
    "thus the pole of this function ( with respect to @xmath106 ) will still be placed in the upper half plane .",
    "this allows to perform the next integration over @xmath106 in the same manner .",
    "the only function entering joint probability density ( [ 21 ] ) depending on this argument is @xmath107 . as well as in the previous case",
    ", the integration over @xmath106 corresponds to multiplication by the factor @xmath103 and replacement @xmath108 in factor @xmath109 , which arose as a result of the previous integration , etc .",
    "hence , every new integration over @xmath96 with lower and lower number @xmath49 corresponds to multiplication by @xmath103 ( i.e. erasing of such a factor in the denominator of expression ( [ 21 ] ) ) and to replacement @xmath110 in the last term .    when the number @xmath49 of a variable of integration will decrease down to @xmath111 , the further integrations can be performed similarly ( i.e. by making replacements of arguments ) , but now the above replacements should be performed in the factor @xmath112 as well .",
    "thus , we come to the conclusion , that integration over all variables in ( [ 22 ] ) corresponds to sequential replacements of symbols @xmath113 figuring in ( [ 22 ] ) in accordance with the above rules .",
    "for example , the appropriate replacements for @xmath101 have the form : is the major of sites numbers @xmath114 of the diagram under consideration , the replacements of remaining symbols are included in the sequence , presented below . ]",
    "@xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 the last integration over @xmath121 corresponds to replacement @xmath122 , as this integration is performed with function @xmath123 ( see ( [ 21 ] ) ) .",
    "it is easy to see , that if @xmath124 , the chain of replacements ( [ 23 ] ) simplifies and corresponds to the replacement @xmath125 .",
    "thus , the average ( [ 22 ] ) corresponds to the replacement of all symbols @xmath126 with @xmath127 , as well as in the case of uncorrelated lloyd model ( [ 8a ] ) , and we come to the conclusion , that _ the averaged green s function of the correlated lloyd model with site energies in the form ( [ 11a ] ) does not depend on the correlation radius @xmath128 and appears to be the same , as at lack of correlations _ ,",
    "i.e. is defined by formula ( [ 9a ] ) .",
    "lack of dependence of the averaged green s function on correlation radius @xmath128 reveals an original scale invariance of the considered correlated lloyd model , because the spatial dependence ( dependence on the site number ) of random potential @xmath50 ( [ 11a ] ) appears to be essentially not the same for various @xmath129 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( d , c ) ) .",
    "let s illustrate the obtained result by examples , when green s function @xmath130 ( [ 10a ] ) can be calculated analytically .",

    "the average density of states @xmath133 i m sp @xmath134 of the random matrix ( [ 1a ] ) with site energies @xmath5 in the form ( [ 11a ] ) and with @xmath135 , does not depend on correlation radius @xmath128 and can be calculated as : @xmath136     and various types of function @xmath3 , describing the nondiagonal elements of the hamiltonian ( [ 1a ] ) .",
