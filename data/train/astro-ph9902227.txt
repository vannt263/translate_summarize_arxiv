    "during the last decade many investigations have revealed the presence of `` young massive star clusters '' ( ymcs ) or `` super star clusters '' in mergers and starburst galaxies , and it has been speculated that these objects could be young analogues of the globular clusters seen today in the milky way .",
    "it is an intriguing idea that globular clusters could still be formed today in some environments , because the study of such objects would be expected to provide a direct insight into the conditions that were present in the early days of our own and other galaxies when the globular clusters we see today in the halos were formed .",
    "probably the most famous example of a merger galaxy hosting `` young massive clusters '' is the `` antennae '' , ngc  4038/39 where whitmore & schweizer ( 1995 ) discovered more than 700 blue point - like sources with absolute visual magnitudes up to @xmath2 .",
    "other well - known examples are ngc  7252 ( whitmore et .",
    "al . 1993 ) , ngc  3921 ( schweizer et . al . 1996 ) and ngc  1275 ( holtzman et .",
    "al . 1992 ) .",
    "all of these galaxies are peculiar systems and obvious mergers .",
    "in fact , in _ all _ cases investigated so far where star formation is associated with a merger , ymcs have been identified ( ashman & zepf 1998 ) .",
    "but ymcs exist not only in mergers .",
    "they have been located also in starburst galaxies such as ngc  1569 and ngc  1705 ( oconnell et .",
    "al . 1994 ) , ngc  253 ( watson et . al . 1996 ) and m82 ( oconnell et . al . 1995 ) , in the nuclear rings of ngc  1097 and ngc  6951 ( barth et . al . 1995 ) , and in the blue compact galaxy eso-338-ig04 ( stlin et .",
    "al . 1998 ) .",
    "the magnitudes of ymcs reported in all these galaxies range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , and the effective radii @xmath5 ( @xmath5 = the radius within which half of the light is contained ) have been estimated to be of the order of a few parsec to about 20 pc , compatible with the objects deserving the designation `` young globular clusters '' .",
    "all of the systems mentioned above are relatively distant , but in fact one does not have to go farther away than the local group in order to find galaxies containing rather similar star clusters .",
    "the magellanic clouds have long been known to host star clusters of a type not seen in the milky way , i.e. compact clusters that are much more massive than galactic open clusters ( van den bergh 1991 , richtler 1993 ) , and in many respects resemble globular clusters more than open clusters .",
    "some of the most conspicuous examples are the @xmath6 years old cluster in the centre of the 30 doradus nebula in the lmc ( brandl et .",
    "al . 1996 ) , shining at an absolute visual magnitude of about -11 , and the somewhat older object ngc  1866 ( about @xmath7 years ) , also in the lmc ( fischer et .",
    "al . 1992 ) , which has an absolute visual magnitude of @xmath8 . even if these clusters are not quite as spectacular as those found in genuine starburst galaxies , they are still more massive than any of the open clusters seen in the milky way today .",
    "ymcs have been reported also in m33 ( christian & schommer 1988 ) , and in the giant sc spiral m101 ( bresolin et .",
    "al . 1996 ) .    taking into account the spread in the ages of the ymcs in the antennae , fritze - v. alvensleben ( 1998 ) recovered a luminosity function ( lf ) resembling that of old globular clusters ( gc s ) to a very high degree when evolving the present lf to an age of 12 gyr .",
    "elmegreen & efremov ( 1997 ) point out the interesting fact that the _ upper _ end of the lf of old gc systems is very similar to that observed for ymcs , open clusters in the milky way , and even for hii regions in the milky way , and this is one of their arguments in favour of the hypothesis that the basic mechanism behind the formation of all these objects is the same .",
    "they argue that massive clusters are formed whenever there is a high pressure in the interstellar medium , due to starbursts or other reasons as e.g. a high virial density ( as in nuclear rings and dwarf galaxies ) .",
    "however , this does nt seem to explain the presence of ymcs in apparently undisturbed disk galaxies like m33 and m101 .",
    "so it remains a puzzling problem to understand why ymcs exist in certain galaxies , but not in others . in this paper",
    "we describe some first results from an investigation aiming at addressing this question .",
    "it seems that ymc s can exist in a wide variety of host galaxy environments , and there are no clear systematics in the properties of the galaxies in which ymc s have been identified .",
    "and just like it is not clear how ymcs and old globular clusters are related to each other , one can also ask if the very luminous ymcs in mergers and starburst galaxies are basically the same type of objects as those in the magellanic clouds , m33 and m101 .

    "the columns labeled @xmath9 and @xmath10 refer to the number of `` blue '' and `` red '' clusters respectively , according to the definition that `` blue '' clusters are clusters with @xmath11 ( and hence @xmath12 ) whereas the `` red '' clusters have @xmath13 ( and @xmath14 ) .",
    "see also sect .",
    "[ sec : id ] .",
    "the data for the lmc are from bica et .",
    "al . ( 1996 ) and those for m33 are from christian & schommer ( 1988 ) .",
    "the `` specific frequencies '' @xmath15 for the galaxies in our sample are given in the fourth column of table [ tab : tn ] .",
    "the number @xmath16 used to derive @xmath15 is the total number of clusters , `` red '' and `` blue '' , detected in each galaxy .",
    "the errors on @xmath15 were estimated taking into consideration only the uncertainties of the absolute magnitudes of the host galaxies resulting from the distance errors as given in table  [ tab : gal ] and poisson statistics of the cluster counts .",
    "however , it is clear that this is not a realistic estimate of the total uncertainties of the @xmath15 values .",
    "another source of uncertainty arises from incompleteness effects , particularly for the more distant galaxies . for all galaxies with more than 20 clusters we estimated the incompleteness by adding artificial clusters with magnitudes of 18.0 , 18.5 @xmath17 21.0 , and testing how many of the artificially added clusters were detected by daofind in _ all _ of the filters @xmath18,@xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "because the completeness depends critically on the size of the objects , we carried out completeness tests for artificial clusters with @xmath21 pc and @xmath22 pc in each galaxy .",
    "the numbers of clusters actually detected in each of the magnitude bins [ 18.25 - 18.75 ] , [ 18.75 - 19.25 ] @xmath17 [ 20.75 - 21.25 ] were then corrected by the fraction of artificial clusters recovered in the corresponding bin , and finally the `` corrected '' @xmath15 values were derived .",
    "these are given in the last column of table  [ tab : tn ] , labeled @xmath23 , for point sources ( first line ) and objects with @xmath22 pc ( second line ) .",
    "see larsen  ( 1999 ) for more details on the completeness corrections .",
    "one additional source of errors affecting @xmath15 which remains uncorrected , is the fact that an uncertainty in the distance also affects the magnitude limit for detection of star clusters .",
    "if a galaxy is more distant ( or nearby ) than the value we have adopted , our limit corresponds to a `` too bright '' ( too faint ) absolute magnitude , and we have underestimated ( overestimated ) the number of clusters .",
    "hence , the true @xmath15 errors are somewhat larger than those given in table  [ tab : tn ] , but they depend on the cluster luminosity function . if the clusters follow a luminosity function of the form @xmath24 ( whitmore & schweizer 1995 ) then a difference in the magnitude limit of @xmath25 would lead to a difference in the cluster counts of about 7% .    a histogram of the uncorrected @xmath15 values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tnhisto ] ) shows that a wide range of @xmath15 values are present within our sample .",
    "many of the galaxies in the lowest bins contain only a few massive clusters or none at all , but a few galaxies have much higher @xmath15 values than the average .",
    "the most extreme @xmath15 values are found in ngc  1156 , ngc  1313 , ngc  3621 , ngc  5204 and ngc  5236 .",
    "the galaxy ngc  2997 also hosts a very rich cluster system , but the @xmath15 value is probably severely underestimated because of the large distance of ngc  2997 which introduces significant incompleteness problems .",
    "a similar remark applies to two other distant galaxies observed at the danish 1.54 m. telescope , ngc  1493 and ngc  7424 , while all the remaining galaxies in table  [ tab : gal ] are either more nearby , or have been observed at the not in better seeing conditions , and hence their @xmath15 values are believed to be more realistic .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : bv_ub ] we show the @xmath26 diagrams for six cluster - rich galaxies .",
    "these plots also include the so - called `` s '' sequence defined by girardi et .",
    "( 1995 , see also elson & fall ( 1985 ) ) , represented as a dashed line .",
    "the `` s '' sequence is essentially an age sequence , derived as a fit to the average colours of bright lmc clusters in the @xmath27 diagram",
    ". the age increases as one moves along the s - sequence from blue to red colours .",
    "the colours of our cluster candidates are very much compatible with those of the s - sequence , especially if one considers that there is a considerable scatter around the s - sequence also for magellanic cloud clusters ( girardi et .",
    "al . 1995 ) . also included in the diagrams are stellar models by bertelli et .",
    "1994 ) ( dots ) , in order to demonstrate that the position of clusters within such a diagram is distinctly different from that of single stars . already from fig .",
    "[ fig : bv_ub ] one can see that there is a considerable age spread among the clusters in each galaxy , with the red cut - off being due to our selection criteriae .",
    "the reddening vector corresponding to a reddening of @xmath28 is shown in each plot as an arrow , and it is quite clear that the spread along the s - sequence can not be entirely due to reddening effects .",

    "1996 ) used hst data to carry out photometry for star clusters in the giant sc - type spiral m101 . a comparison between their data and photometry for clusters in one of our galaxies ( ngc  1313 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m101 ] .",
    "it is evident that the colours of clusters in the two galaxies are very similar .",
    "ngc  1313 was chosen as an illustrative example because it contains a relatively rich cluster system , although not so rich that the diagram becomes too crowded .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : m101 ] we have also included a curve showing the colours of star clusters according to the population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 , hereafter bc93 ) .",
    "the agreement between the synthetic and observed colours is very good for , but for the b - v colours of the bc93 models are systematically too blue compared to our data and the s sequence .",
    "the `` red loop '' that extends out to and is due to the appearance of red supergiants at an age of about @xmath6 years ( girardi & bica 1993 ) and is strongly metallicity dependent .",
    "girardi et .",
    "1995 ) constructed population synthesis models based on a set of isochrones by bertelli et .",
    "al . ( 1994 ) and found very good agreement between the s - sequence and their synthetic colours .",
    "the models ( solar metallicity ) are included in fig .",
    "[ fig : m101 ] as a solid line . in these models",
    "the `` red loop '' is not as pronounced as in the bc93 models , and the youngest models are in general not as blue as those of bc93 , resulting in a much better fit to the observed cluster colours .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm     +    = 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm     +    = 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    a direct determination of the mass of an unresolved star cluster requires a knowledge of the m / l ratio , which in turn depends on many other quantities , in particular the age and the imf of the cluster .",
    "however , if one assumes that the imf does not vary too much from one star cluster to another , then the luminosities alone should facilitate a comparison of star clusters _ with similar ages_.    applying the s - sequence age calibration to the clusters in our sample , the luminosities of each cluster can then be directly compared to milky way clusters of similar age , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : age_mv ] .",
    "ages and absolute visual magnitudes for milky way open clusters are from the lyng ( 1982 ) catalogue , and are represented in each plot as small crosses . in the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : age_mv ] we have also indicated the effect of a reddening of e(b - v ) = 0.30 . in these plots",
    "the `` reddening vector '' depends in principle on the original position of the cluster within the ( u - b , b - v ) diagram from which the age was derived , but we have included two typical reddening vectors , corresponding to two different ages .    in all of the galaxies in fig .",
    "[ fig : age_mv ] but ngc  2403 , the absolute visual magnitudes of the brightest clusters are 2 - 3 magnitudes brighter than the upper limit of milky way open clusters of similar ages",
    ". accordingly they should be nearly 10 times more massive . in the case of ngc  2403 ,",
    "the most massive clusters are not significantly more massive than open clusters found in the milky way .",
    "[ fig : age_mv ] also confirms the suspicion that the cluster data in ngc  2997 are incomplete , particularly for @xmath29 .",
    "we have included population synthesis models for the luminosity evolution of single - burst stellar populations of solar metallicity by bc93 in fig .",
    "[ fig : age_mv ] , scaled to a total mass of @xmath30 .",
    "models for three different imfs are plotted : salpeter  ( 1955 ) , miller - scalo  ( 1979 ) and scalo  ( 1986 ) , all covering a mass range from 0.1 - 65 @xmath31 .",
    "the different assumptions about the shape of the imf obviously affect the evolution of the @xmath32 magnitude per unit mass quite strongly , and unfortunately the effect is most severe just in the age interval we are interested in .",
    "the difference between the miller - scalo and the scalo imf amounts to almost 2 magnitudes , but in any case the most massive clusters appear to have masses around @xmath30 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : age_mv ] we have also indicated the location of a `` typical '' old globular cluster system with an error bar centered on the coordinates 15 gyr , @xmath33 and with @xmath34 mags .",
    "although the comparison of masses at high and low age based on population synthesis models is extremely sensitive to the exact shape of the imf , it seems that the masses of the young massive star clusters are at least within the range of `` true '' globular clusters .",
    "reddening effects alone are unlikely to affect the derived ages to a high degree , as a scatter along the `` reddening vectors '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : age_mv ] would then be expected .",
    "basically this would mean that one would expect a much steeper rate of decrease in @xmath32 vs. the derived age , while the observed relation between age and the upper luminosity limit is in fact remarkably compatible with that predicted by the models .",
    "the comparison with model calculations implies that the upper mass limit for clusters must have remained relatively unchanged over the entire period during which clusters have been formed in each galaxy .",
    "this is a magellanic - type irregular galaxy , currently undergoing an episode of intense star formation .",
    "1995 noted that the spectrum of ngc  1156 resembles that of the `` w - r galaxy '' ngc  4214 .",
    "ngc  1156 is a completely isolated galaxy , so the starburst could not have been triggered by interaction with other galaxies .",
    "we have found a number of massive star clusters in ngc  1156 .",
    "this is an sb(s)d galaxy of absolute @xmath19 magnitude @xmath35 . de vaucouleurs 1963 found a distance modulus of @xmath36 , which we adopt .",
    "the morphology of ngc  1313 is peculiar in the sense that many detached sections of star formation are found , particularly in the south - western part of the galaxy .",
    "there is also a `` loop '' extending about 1.5 kpc ( projected ) to the east of the bar with a number of hii regions and massive star clusters .",
    "another interesting feature is that one can see an extended , elongated diffuse envelope of optical light , with the major axis rotated @xmath37 relative to the central bar of ngc  1313 , embedding the whole galaxy .",
    "it has been suggested by ryder et .",
    "1995 ) that the diffuse envelope surrounding ngc  1313 is associated with galactic cirrus known to exist in this part of the sky ( wang & yu 1995 ) , but this explanation does not seem likely since it would require a very perfect alignment of the centre of ngc  1313 with the diffuse light . also , the outer boundary of the active star - forming parts of galaxy coincide quite well with the borders of the more luminous parts of the envelope . in our opinion",
    "the most likely explanation is that the diffuse envelope is indeed physically associated with ngc  1313 itself .",
    "walsh & roy ( 1997 ) determined o / h abundances for 33 hii regions in ngc  1313 , and found no radial gradient .",
    "this makes ngc  1313 the most massive known barred spiral without any radial abundance gradient .",
    "ngc  1313 hosts a rich population of massive star clusters . when looking at the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : age_mv ] it seems that there is a concentration of clusters at log(age ) @xmath38 8.3 or roughly 200 myr .",
    "we emphasize that this should be confirmed by a more thorough study of the cluster population in this galaxy , and in particular it would be very useful to be able to detect fainter clusters in order to improve the statistics .",
    "if this is real it could imply that some kind of event stimulated the formation of massive star clusters in ngc  1313 a few hundred myr ago , perhaps the accretion of a companion galaxy .",
    "a second `` burst '' of cluster formation seems to have been taking place very recently , and is maybe going on even today .",
    "ngc  2403 is a nearby spiral , morphologically very similar to m33 apart from the fact that ngc  2403 lacks a distinct nucleus .",
    "it is a textbook example of an sc - type spiral , and it is very well resolved on our not images . a photographic survey of star clusters in ngc  2403",
    "was already carried out by battistini et .",
    "1984 , who succeeded in finding a few ymc candidates .",
    "ngc  2403 spans more than 20 @xmath39 20 arcminutes in the sky , so we have been able to cover only the central parts using the alfosc . within the central @xmath40 ( about 6@xmath396 kpc )",
    "we have located 14 clusters altogether , but the real number of clusters in ngc  2403 should be significantly higher , taking into account the large fraction of the galaxy that we havent covered , and considering the fact that in the other galaxies we have studied , many clusters are located at considerable distances from the centre .",
    "ngc  2997 is an example of a `` hot spot '' galaxy ( meaburn et .",
    "al . 1982 ) with a number of uv luminous knots near the centre .",
    "1986 ) studied the knots and concluded that they are in fact very massive star clusters , and maoz et .",

    "of 24 clusters detected in the f606w filter as well as in an earlier f220w image , all have colours implying ages less than 100 myr and masses @xmath41 .",
    "al . ( 1996 ) conclude that the clusters in the centre of ngc  2997 will eventually evolve into objects resembling globular clusters as we know them in the milky way today .    in our study",
    "we have found a number of massive star clusters also outside the centre of ngc  2997 . taking the numbers at face value",
    ", the cluster system does not appear to be as rich as that of ngc  5236 , but with better and more complete data we would expect to see a number of ymcs in ngc  2997 that could rival that in ngc  5236 .",
    "this galaxy is at first sight a quite ordinary late - type spiral , and has not received much attention .",
    "it was observed with the hst by rawson et .",

    "our data show that ngc  3621 contains a surprisingly high number of massive star clusters .",
    "the galaxy is rather inclined ( @xmath42 , rawson et .",
    "al . 1997 ) , and nearly all the clusters are seen projected on the near side of the galaxy , so a number of clusters on the far side may be hidden from our view .",
    "ryder & dopita ( 1993 ) noted a lack of hii regions on the far side of the galaxy , and pointed out that there is also a quite prominent spiral arm on the near side that does nt appear to have a counterpart on the far side .",
    "so it remains possible that the excess of young clusters and hii regions on the near side is real .",
    "ngc  5204 is a companion to the giant sc spiral m101 .",
    "the structure of the hi in this galaxy is that of a strongly warped disk ( sicotte & carignan 1997 ) , and one could speculate that this is related to tidal interaction effects with m101 .",
    "sicotte & carignan ( 1997 ) also find that the dark matter halo of ngc  5204 contributes significantly to the mass even in the inner parts .",
    "the high @xmath15 value of this galaxy is a consequence of its very low @xmath43 rather than a high absolute number of clusters - we found only 7 clusters in this galaxy .",
    "curiously , all of the 7 clusters belong to the `` red '' class , suggesting that no new clusters are being formed in ngc  5204 at the moment .",
    "ngc 5236 ( m83 ) is a grand - design barred spiral of type sbc , striking by its regularity and its very high surface brightness - the highest among the galaxies in our sample .",

    "ngc  5236 is currently undergoing a burst of star formation in the nucleus as well as in the spiral arms .    a study in the rocket uv ( bohlin et .",

    "the flux was measured through a number of apertures with radii of 50 , 100 , 150 @xmath17 pixels , centered on the galaxies , and the background was measured in an annulus with an inner radius of 850 pixels and a width of 100 pixels .",
    "the flux through the ith annular ring was then calculated as the flux through the ith aperture minus the flux through the ( i-1)th aperture , and the surface brightness was finally derived by dividing with the area of the ith annular ring .",
    "no attempt was made to standard calibrate the surface brightnesses , so the @xmath55-axis units in fig .  [ fig : rprof ] are arbitrary .",
    "the cluster `` surface densities '' were obtained by normalising the number of clusters within each annular ring to the area of the respective rings . finally , all profiles were normalised to the v - band surface brightness profile .    for all the galaxies in fig .",
    "[ fig : rprof ] the similarity between the surface brightness profiles and the cluster surface densities is quite striking . in the cases of ngc  2997 and ngc  5236 , where the @xmath0 profiles are markedly different from the broad - band profiles , the cluster surface densities seem to follow the @xmath0 profiles rather than the broad - band profiles . accordingly the presence of massive clusters must be closely linked with the process of star formation in general in those galaxies where ymcs are present . in order to get a complete picture one should include the clusters in the central starbursts of ngc  2997 and ngc  5236 , but this would , in any case , affect the conclusions only for the innermost bin .",
    "= 8.5 cm    perhaps the most striking fact about the cluster - rich galaxies in our sample is that they do not appear to have a lot of other properties in common .",
    "[ fig : t_tn ] shows the specific frequency @xmath15 as a function of the `` t''-type ( table  [ tab : gal ] ) , and does not support the suggestion by kennicutt & chu ( 1988 ) that the presence of ymcs in galaxies increases along the hubble sequence .",
    "instead , at wide range of @xmath15 values is seen independently of hubble type , so even if ymcs might be absent in galaxies of even earlier types than we have studied here the phenomenon can not be entirely related to morphology",
    ".    however , what characterises all these cluster systems is that they do not seem to have been formed during one intense burst of star formation . instead",
    ", their age distributions as inferred from the `` s '' sequence are quite smooth ( possibly with the exception of ngc  1313 ) , so in contrast to starburst galaxies like the antennae or m82 , the rather `` normal '' galaxies in our sample have been able to maintain a `` production '' of clusters over a longer timescale , at least several hundred myr , in a more quiescent mode than that of the starburst galaxies .",
    "the most luminous clusters we have found have absolute visual magnitudes of about @xmath56 , about three magnitudes brighter than the brightest open clusters in the milky way , but still somewhat fainter than the @xmath51 to @xmath2 clusters in the antennae and certain starburst galaxies .    one notable exception is ngc  6946 which is forming such a `` super star cluster '' just before our eyes . that cluster is located far away from the centre of the galaxy , something which is not unusual at all .",
    "also in ngc  1313 the most massive cluster is located far from the centre of the host galaxy , at a projected galactocentric distance of about 3.7 kpc , and in the milky way a number of high - mass ( old ) open clusters are found in the anticentre direction , e.g. m67 .",
    "it can of course not be excluded that a massive cluster like the one in ngc  6946 could be located in a region of the galactic disk hidden from our view , but in any case the milky way does not seem to contain any large number of young massive clusters as seen e.g. in ngc  5236 or ngc  1313 .",
    "in general we find , however , that the distribution of ymcs follows the h@xmath1 surface brightness profile , at least for those galaxies where the statistics allow such a comparison .",
    "taking h@xmath1 as an indicator of star formation , it then appears that in certain galaxies the formation of ymcs occurs whenever stars are formed .",
    "this raises the question whether the presence of massive cluster formation is correlated with global star formation indicators , such as @xmath0 luminosity or other parameters .",
    "these questions will be addressed in more detail in a subsequent paper ( larsen et .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "two of the galaxies in our sample , ngc  5236 and ngc  2997 , have a lot of properties in common .",
    "both galaxies are grand - design , high surface - brightness spirals although ngc  2997 lacks the impressive bar of ngc  5236 , and both were known to contain massive star clusters near their centres also before this study .",
    "we have identified rich cluster system throughout the disks of these two galaxies .    in our opinion",
    "it is becoming clearer and clearer that a whole continuum of cluster properties ( age , mass , size ) must exist , one just has to look in the right places .",
    "for some reason the milky way and many other galaxies were only able to form very massive , compact star clusters during the early phases of their evolution , these clusters are today seen as globular clusters in the halos of these galaxies .",
    "other galaxies such as the magellanic clouds , m33 and ngc  2403 are able to form substantially larger number of massive clusters than the milky way even today , and in our sample of galaxies we have at least 5 galaxies that are able to form clusters whose masses reach well into the interval defined by the globular clusters of the milky way .",
    "still more massive clusters are being formed today in genuine starburst and merger galaxies such as the antennae , ngc  7252 , m82 and others , and it seems that the masses of these clusters can easily compete with those of `` high - end '' globular clusters in the milky way . whether ymcs will survive long enough to one day be regarded as `` true '' globular clusters is still a somewhat controversial question , whose definitive answer requires a detailed knowledge of the internal structure of the individual clusters and a better theoretical understanding of the dynamical evolution of star clusters in general .",
    "one could also ask if the lf of star clusters really has an upper cut - off that varies from galaxy to galaxy , or if the presence of massive clusters is merely a statistical effect that follows from a generally rich cluster system . in order to investigate this question",
    "it is necessary to obtain data with a sufficiently high resolution that the search for star clusters can be extended to much fainter magnitudes than we have been able to do in our study .",
    "the data presented in this paper demonstrate that massive star clusters are formed not only in starburst galaxies , but also in rather normal galaxies .",
    "none of the galaxies in our sample show obvious signs of having been involved in interaction processes , yet we find that there is a large variation in the specific frequency @xmath15 of massive clusters from one galaxy to another . some of the galaxies in our sample ( notably ngc  1313 and ngc  5236 ) have considerably higher @xmath15 than the lmc , while other galaxies which at first glance could seem in many ways morphologically similar to the lmc ( e.g. ngc  300 and ngc  4395 ) turn out to contain no rich cluster systems .",
    "in general there is no correlation between the morphological type of the galaxies in our sample and their @xmath15 values . whether a galaxy contains massive star clusters or not is therefore not only a question of its morphology ( as suggested by kennicutt & chu 1988 ) , so one has to search for correlations between other parameters and the @xmath15 values . within each of the galaxies that contain populations of ymcs",
    ", the number of clusters as a function of radius follows the h@xmath1 surface brightness more closely than the broad - band surface brightness , which implies that the formation of massive clusters in a given galaxy is closely linked to star formation in general .",
    "this research was supported by the danish natural science research council through its centre for ground - based observational astronomy .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
