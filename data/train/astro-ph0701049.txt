    "unfortunately , the sn explosions occurred while the galaxies were behind the sun , and were only detected after becoming visible again in the early morning , so the objects were discovered rather late in their evolution .",
    "spectra obtained soon after the time of discovery show that both sne are of type ii : sn 2006my is similar to sn ii - p 1999em ( hamuy et  al .",

    ".  2006 ) ( see  2 for a more detailed discussion of the age and reddening of both sne ) .",
    "we took ground - based images of the sne with the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) under good seeing conditions ( figures 1 and 2 ) , and are able to precisely ( to within @xmath10 and @xmath11 , for sne 2006my and 2006ov , respectively ) locate the site of both sne on pre - sn archival _ hst _ images of the host galaxies .",

    "we note that ngc 4651 also produced sn 1987k , while m61 produced sne 1926a , 1961i , 1964f , and 1999gn .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 we discuss the properties ( type , age , and reddening ) of both sne , and demonstrate that they are of the type ii variety discovered near the end of the plateau phase . in ",
    "3 we report our identification of the progenitors in the pre - sn _ hst_/wfpc2 images .",
    "we describe the nature of the progenitors inferred from the _ hst _ photometry in  4 .",
    "further discussion is in  5 , and we summarize our conclusions in  6 .",
    "there are several subclasses of sne  ii ( see filippenko 1997 for a review of sn types ) . among these ,",
    "the type ii - plateau ( sne  ii - p ) are the most common , with the defining feature being a prominent plateau phase in their optical light curve .",
    "the type ii - linear ( sne  ii - l ) show a linear decline in magnitude after their maximum brightness , and are relatively rare .",
    "the sn 1987a - like objects are subluminous and show a very broad peak in the light curve .",
    "the type ii - narrow ( sne  iin ) , which have relatively narrow spectral features sometimes ( but not always ) superimposed on a broader component , are a more heterogeneous subclass than the others .",
    "moreover , the type iib sne , such as sn 1993j in m81 ( filippenko et  al .  1993 ; nomoto et  al .",
    "1993 ) , manifest themselves as sne  ii at early times , but then experience a spectroscopic metamorphosis into a sn  ib at late times ( see sn 1987k , filippenko 1988 ) .",
    "the different subclasses may have quite different progenitor systems .",
    "thus in this section , we study the photometric and spectroscopic behavior of sne 2006my and 2006ov , to get an initial indication of their nature .",
    "we followed sne 2006my and 2006ov with the 0.76-m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; li et  al .",
    "2000 ; filippenko et  al .",
    "2001 ; filippenko 2005 ) at lick observatory soon after their discoveries .",
    "kait , which conducts the successful lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) , did not discover these two sne because of its search strategy of focusing on near - meridian objects , and the two sne were 23 hours east of the meridian at the end of the night when discovered by itagaki . as both sne were discovered at late times , we did not start an intense multi - color campaign of follow - up observations .",
    "instead , the two sne were imaged in unfiltered mode nearly nightly , with occasional broad - band @xmath12 photometry .",
    "an advantage of observing with the unfiltered mode is that we have good pre - sn unfiltered template images for the sn host galaxies accumulated during the course of loss .",
    "these templates enable us to perform galaxy subtraction , which significantly increases the photometric accuracy as both sne ( especially sn 2006ov ) are heavily contaminated by host - galaxy emission . here",
    "we report relative unfiltered photometry for sne 2006my and 2006ov , providing the necessary information on their photometric behavior ( e.g. , whether they have a plateau or linear phase ) .",
    "a full treatment of all available follow - up data for these sne is beyond the scope of this paper , and will be discussed elsewhere .    for the unfiltered images of sne 2006my and 2006ov",
    ", we first perform galaxy subtraction with a customized software package .",
    "the sn image is registered to the pre - sn unfiltered template , their point spread functions ( psfs ) are convolved to the same level , the intensities of the images are matched , and a final subtraction is performed .",
    "this procedure is essentially that used for processing unfiltered images by the loss sn search pipeline .",
    "we use the iraf daophot package ( stetson 1987 ) to perform standard aperture photometry for the sne and several bright stars in the field . a relative light curve",
    "is then generated by averaging the differences between the magnitudes of the sne and the bright stars .",
    "as the best match to broad - band filters for the kait unfiltered data is the @xmath13 band ( li et  al .",
    "2003 ) , in figure 3 we compare our relative unfiltered light curves for sne 2006my and 2006ov to the @xmath13-band light curve of sn 1999em , a well - studied sn  ii - p ( leonard et  al .  2002b ; hamuy et  al .  2001 ; elmhamdi et  al .",
    "the relative unfiltered light curves of the sne are visually shifted by a constant to match the light curve of sn 1999em .",
    "figure 3 indicates a good match between sn 1999em and sn 2006my : the behavior of the decline from the plateau is almost identical for both sne .",
    "there is no doubt that sn 2006ov is a sn ii - p as well , because it shows a prominent plateau phase .",
    "however , it has a steeper decline from the plateau than do sne 1999em and 2006my .",
    "thus , sn 2006my and sn 2006ov behave like sne  ii - p discovered near the end of their plateau phase .",
    "the duration of the plateau phase of sne  ii - p , however , varies significantly . from a sample of 13 sne",
    "ii - p studied by hamuy ( 2003 ) , hendry et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) derived a mean plateau duration of @xmath14 days , with a range of 110 to 170 days .",
    "consequently , it is unclear which sn exploded first , sn 2006my or sn 2006ov .",
    "although sn 2006my appears to be farther along the plateau than sn 2006ov on the same date , sn 2006ov could have had a longer plateau phase and thus exploded earlier .",
    "our estimate of the age of sne 2006my and 2006ov at the time of discovery ( @xmath153 months after explosion ) is somewhat older than the ages suggested by other groups based on spectra : @xmath1512 months for sn 2006my ( stanishev & nielsen 2006 ) , and @xmath151 month for sn 2006ov ( blondin et  al .",
    "next , we will check our own spectra to provide further age estimates for both sne , and attempt to constrain the reddening toward them .",
    "we obtained three optical spectra of sne 2006my and 2006ov with the keck 10-m telescopes using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) , and with the lick observatory 3-m shane telescope using the kast double spectrograph ( miller & stone 1993 ) .",
    "a journal of observations is given in table 1 .",
    "all one - dimensional sky - subtracted spectra were extracted optimally in the usual manner ( e.g. , foley et al .",
    "for the kast observations , flatfields for the red - side ccd were taken at the position of the object to reduce near - infrared fringing effects .",
    "the spectra were corrected for atmospheric extinction and telluric bands ( bessell 1999 ; matheson et al .",
    "2000 ) , and then flux - calibrated using standard stars observed at similar airmass on the same night as the sne .    in figure 4",
    "we show a comparison of the spectra of sne 2006my and 2006ov to those of other well - studied sne  ii - p at similar epochs .",
    "the spectra of sne 2004dj and 2003gd are previously unpublished data from our own spectral database .",
    "all spectra in figure 4 have been corrected for the reddening toward the sne and also for the host - galaxy redshift . for sn 2003gd",
    ", we adopt @xmath16 mag , and an explosion date of 2003 march 17 ( van dyk , li , & filippenko 2003 ) . for sn 2004dj",
    ", we adopt @xmath17 mag , and an explosion date of 2004 june 30 ( zhang et  al .",
    "2005 ; vink et  al .",
    "we emphasize that both sne 2003gd and 2004dj were discovered in the middle of the plateau phase , so their explosion dates have relatively large uncertainties due to the large scatter in the plateau durations .",
    "only the galactic reddening of @xmath18 mag and 0.022 mag ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) were removed from the spectra of sn 2006my and sn 2006ov , respectively .",
    "figure 4 demonstrates a striking similarity between the spectra of sn 2006my and sn 2006ov , as well as their resemblance to the spectra of sne 2004dj and 2003gd at 34 months after explosion .",
    "other signs of a relatively old age for these sne ii - p are the strong , relatively narrow , ca  ii near - ir triplet ( one sees the 8498    and 8662     components , with the 8542    component blended within ) , and hints of the [ ca  ii ] @xmath197291 , 7324 and [ fe  ii ] @xmath207155 lines often seen in sne  ii - p during the nebular phase .",
    "the spectra in figure 4 also show that with just the corrections for galactic reddening , the spectra of sne 2006my and 2006ov have a continuum shape similar to that of the other two sne  ii - p .",
    "this argues against the existence of large host - galaxy reddening toward either sn 2006my or sn 2006ov .",
    "blondin et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , however , suggested that sn 2006ov is reddened ( but they did not quote an estimate of the amount of the host - galaxy reddening ) .",
    "a possible cause of this discrepancy may be that blondin et  al .  compared their spectrum of sn 2006ov to that of a sn  ii",
    "- p at a much earlier phase ( @xmath151 month after explosion ) than our estimated age ( @xmath153 months after explosion ) .",
    "as sne  ii - p become progressively redder at later times , comparing the spectrum of an older sn  ii - p to a younger object would give the incorrect impression that the older object is reddened .",
    "to further investigate the reddening , in figure 5 we plot a close - up of the spectral range near the na  i  d absorption lines of both sn 2006my and sn 2006ov .",
    "it is expected that reddening caused by the dust in a galaxy would produce noticeable narrow na  i  d absorption lines in an object s spectrum , although the quantitative correlation between the strength of na  i  d absorption and the amount of reddening is still quite uncertain .",
    "figure 5 shows no signs of prominent , narrow na  i  d at the rest wavelengths corresponding to either the milky way galaxy or the hosts ( a hint of narrow na  i  d absorption due to the milky way galaxy might be present in the spectrum of sn 2006ov ) .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence for significant host - galaxy reddening of either sn 2006my and sn 2006ov .",
    "the photometry and spectroscopy of sne 2006my and 2006ov indicate that both objects are sne  ii - p discovered near the end of the plateau phase .",
    "we now turn to the analysis of the archival _ hst _ data available for ngc 4651 and m61 , identifying the progenitors of both sne and studying the environments of the progenitors .",

    "we identified 20 stars ( or compact star clusters ) present in both the cfht and wfpc2 images for which we were able to precisely measure the ( x ,  y ) center positions .",
    "then , using the iraf task geomap , we performed a geometrical transformation between the two sets of coordinates , and were able to match them to @xmath26 wfc pixel root - mean - square ( 1@xmath0 @xmath27 ) . as the mosaic process involves some uncertainties caused by geometrical distortions and chip gaps among the four individual wfpc2 chips , we further attempted to match the cfht image to the chip 2 ( wfc2 ) f814w image ( where the sn site is located ) before the image was mosaiced .",
    "13 common stars were identified , with a geometrical transformation uncertainty of 0.45 pixel ( 1@xmath0 @xmath28 ) .",

    "the probability of two rsgs occurring in adjacent pixels on the wfc2 image , however , is very small considering the density of such stars in the environment of sn 2006my ( 0.4% , not including possible physical clustering of massive stars ; see discussion in  5 ) .",

    "contamination by the bright source to the northeast of the sn location is a possible explanation for the failure by hstphot to make a detection of the central source in the error circle .",
    "since we have an accurate ( 1@xmath0 = 0.17 pixel ) position for the putative progenitor of sn 2006ov as determined from the acs / hrc to wfpc2 astrometric registration , we forced hstphot to make a measurement at the progenitor position .",
    "this procedure yielded a 6.1@xmath0 detection with f814w = @xmath42 mag , and a residual image with all sources within the 1@xmath0 error radius cleanly removed .",

    "we measured a 2.2@xmath0 source with f606w = @xmath43 , and a 6.1@xmath0 source with f450w = @xmath44 mag .",
    "although the detection in the f606w image is of low s / n ( 2.2@xmath0 ) due to possible blending from other sources , the measured magnitude ( f606w = @xmath43 mag ) is brighter than the 3@xmath0 limiting magnitude ( f606w @xmath39 25.3 mag ) , and inspection of figure 8 suggests a hint of the progenitor in the f606w image , so we kept the f606w detection as it is .",
    "the 6.1@xmath0 detection in the f450w image is likely caused by another source ; as previously noted , it appears to be offset from the progenitor in the f814w image .",

    "it is clear that the adopted distances to the galaxies have a relatively large impact on the derived progenitor masses . as a byproduct of the cmd study",
    ", we provide an independent constraint on the distances to ngc 4651 and ngc 4303 from the global stellar photometry on the _ hst _ images . for sn 2006my , we measured the photometry of all the stars ( with s / n @xmath75 3 ) on the four wfpc2 chips on the f555w and f814w images , and plotted their magnitudes on the @xmath66 vs. @xmath67 cmd with an adopted distance to ngc 4651 .",

    "although this method is plagued by the need to adopt a global metallicity for all the stars ( while in reality they should come from a range of metallicities from different regions of ngc 4651 ) , possible contamination of compact stellar clusters in the photometry , and no reddening corrections , it nevertheless suggests that @xmath60 mag ( the average vc distance ) provides a better fit to the data than the average t - f distances ( @xmath50 ) . for sn 2006ov",
    ", the f450w and f814w images were used to derive a @xmath76 vs. @xmath67 cmd , and the data favor the average t - f distance ( @xmath53 mag ) over the average vc distance ( @xmath60 mag ) .",
    "the global metallicity was adopted as solar for both galaxies , even though the sn sites are subsolar .",
    "owing to the relatively large uncertainties in the distance estimates , our conservative approach is to adopt the progenitor masses as derived from the distances favored by the cmd study ( @xmath60 mag for sn 2006my , and @xmath53 mag for sn 2006ov ) , but allow the errorbars to cover the range of progenitor masses from the other distance estimate .",
    "this gives @xmath3 = @xmath4 @xmath5 for the progenitor of sn 2006my in ngc 4651 , and @xmath6 @xmath5 for the progenitor of sn 2006ov in m61 .",
    "both progenitors have a red color , albeit with a large uncertainty .",
    "their locations on the cmds suggest that the progenitor of sn 2006my is a rsg , while the progenitor of sn 2006ov is consistent with either a rsg or a ysg .",
    "we have located the sites of sne 2006my and 2006ov to high precision on pre - sn _ hst_/wfpc2 images , and identified the likely progenitor stars of both sne . as can be seen in figures 1 and 2 , both sne occurred on a spiral arm of their host galaxies , and their immediate environments are heavily contaminated by host - galaxy emission ( more so for sn 2006ov than sn 2006my ) . even at _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 resolution ( figures 5 and 8) , there are many sources in the sn environments .",
    "it is thus possible that the objects we identified in the error circles are just rsgs that happened to be close to the sn explosion , but are completely unrelated .",
    "the confidence of the progenitor identifications can be strengthened if we put stringent limits on the non - detection of the progenitors . using the limiting magnitudes in table 5 , we place the following mass limits if the progenitors of sne 2006my and 2006ov were not detected in the _ hst_/wfpc2 f814w images : @xmath77 11 @xmath5 or 8 @xmath5 for the sn 2006my progenitor , when @xmath50 mag and @xmath60 mag are adopted for ngc 4651 , respectively ; @xmath77 9 @xmath5 or 13 @xmath5 for the sn 2006ov progenitor , when @xmath53 mag and @xmath78 mag are adopted for m61 , respectively .",

    "hence , there exists the possibility that the progenitors of sn 2006my and/or sn 2006ov were not detected .",
    "the probability of a chance coincidence ( that is , the objects we identified are unrelated rsgs that happened to be within the error circles ) can be further assessed by studying the density of rsgs in the sn environments . within a 1@xmath20 radius ( approximately 80 pc at our adopted average vc distance )",
    ", we identified 6 possible rsgs ( 8 possible rsgs ) in the neighborhood of sn 2006my ( sn 2006ov ) by noting their absolute magnitudes and colors on the cmds .",
    "the probability of a rsg within the 0@xmath2045 ( 0@xmath202 ) error radius is thus 1.2% ( 0.2% ) .",
    "the small probability ( 0.2% ) of a chance coincidence for the progenitor of sn 2006ov solidifies our identification . while the probability of a chance coincidence for the progenitor of sn 2006my is also small ( 1.2% ) , the confidence of our progenitor identification can be further increased if we can significantly reduce the astrometric error radius .    in  3.1 we also mentioned a possible blending issue for the progenitor of sn 2006my .",
    "using the rsg density in the environment of sn 2006my , the chance of two rsgs occurring in adjacent wfc pixels ( 0@xmath21 ) is only 0.4% , assuming that massive stars do nt tend to occur in clusters .",
    "( the probability of blending would increase somewhat if the tendency of massive stars to occur in associations were included , but it would still likely be relatively low . )    the two main reasons for the large mass range of our identified progenitors are ( a ) the uncertain distances to the galaxies , and ( b ) the large photometric uncertainty due to the low s / n of the detections . when more accurate distances for the galaxies ( e.g. , cepheid distances ) become available , the masses of the progenitors will be further constrained .",
    "the second problem highlights the difficulty in directly identifying progenitors of sne : they are faint beyond the local group , and the pre - sn _ hst _ archival images often do not have the optimal combination of filters and depth because most of them were obtained by various observers for different projects .",
    "a dedicated _ hst _ program to image the most nearby galaxies would give observers a chance to identify the progenitors of most core - collapse sne in these galaxies , further advancing our understanding of the death of massive stars .",
    "our identified progenitors of sn 2006my and sn 2006ov increase the number of directly detected progenitors for genuine sne from 7 to 9 .",
    "the first half of table 6 lists the inferred masses of these progenitors .",
    "the progenitors of several probable super - outbursts of luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) misclassified as sne , such as sn 1961v ( zwicky 1964 ) and sn 1997bs ( van dyk et  al .",
    "1999b , 2000 ) , have been identified but are not listed .",
    "the second half of table 6 gives the mass limits for the progenitors of several core - collapse sne .",
    "for these sne , the progenitors are not directly identified , but a mass limit is derived based on the limiting magnitudes of pre - sn images .",
    "in particular , sn 2004dj occurred in a compact star cluster ( csc ) , and the mass of the progenitor is estimated from the properties ( luminosity and color ) of the csc ( maz - apellniz et  al .",
    "2004 ; wang et  al .",
    "sn 2005gl is associated with a very luminous ( @xmath79 mag ) source ( gal - yam et  al .",
    "2007 ) , which could be a very massive single star ( e.g. , an lbv ) or a csc .",
    "there is also some uncertainty regarding the exact type of the sn : while a very early - time spectrum showed narrow hydrogen lines typical of sne  iin , its later spectral evolution is more typical of normal sne  ii , perhaps a sn  ii - l .",
    "it is clear from table 6 that observers have had the most success identifying progenitors for sne  ii - p ( 7 out of 9 ) .",
    "the main reason for this is perhaps the relative frequency of different types of sne .",
    "a preliminary analysis indicates that out of the 68 core - collapse sne discovered by loss within 30 mpc in the past 9 years , 46 are sne  ii ( most of which are sne  ii - p ) , 18 are sne  ib / c , 1 is a sn  iib , and 3 are sne  iin .",
    "sne  ii - p are thus by far the most common type of core - collapse sn .",
    "still , it is a bit surprising that no direct progenitor has been detected for a sn  ib / c , given that they are roughly 40% as frequent as sne  ii from the loss statistics .",
    "one factor is perhaps the low luminosity of the possible progenitors for sne  ib / c , which also limits the progenitors to be either relatively low - mass stripped stars in binary systems , or single wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the inferred masses for the progenitors of sne 2006my and 2006ov are consistent with the trend that sne  ii",

    "2006 ) . in total , there are now 7 directly identified progenitors for sne  ii - p , all with @xmath80 .",
    "the statistics are growing , and suggest that perhaps all sne  ii - p come from low - mass rsgs",
    ". if this is true , stars more massive than @xmath8 may have a different evolutionary path , and explode as other types of sne such as sne  ii - l or sne  iin .",
    "the possible association of the sn  iin / ii - l 2005gl with a very massive single star ( gal - yam et  al .",
    "2007 ) is in agreement with this speculation . in the future ,",
    "when a very massive star explodes as a sn in a nearby galaxy ( a rare event ) , observers may have a chance to study both the massive star and the sn in detail . until then , the fate of the very massive stars ( @xmath81 ) still needs to be observationally verified .",
    "1 .   both sn 2006my in ngc 4651 and sn 2006ov in m61 are sne  ii - p discovered 34 months after explosion . their spectra show no evidence of strong host - galaxy reddening .",
    "we obtained high - quality ground - based cfht images for both sne , and were able to locate the sn sites to high precision on the pre - sn _ hst_/wfpc2 images ( astrometric uncertainty 1@xmath0 = 0@xmath2045 and 0@xmath211 for sne 2006my and 2006ov , respectively ) .",
