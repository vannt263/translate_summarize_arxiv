    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) has been observed in cold dilute samples of ground state alkali atoms @xcite and atomic hydrogen @xcite . in 2001 ,",
    "the first condensate of atoms in an electronically excited state was obtained for metastable he[(1s)(2s)@xmath4s@xmath5 @xcite , referred to as he@xmath1 .",
    "all these systems have an electron configuration with only s - electrons in their open shells in common , resulting in an isotropic electrostatic interaction .",
    "the other candidate for achieving bec with atoms in an electronically excited state is metastable ne[(2p)@xmath6(3s )  @xmath4p@xmath7 , referred to as ne@xmath8 in this paper .",
    "two groups are pursuing this goal : the group of ertmer in hannover @xcite and our group @xcite .",
    "metastable neon is unique among these species in that its binary electrostatic interaction is anisotropic , due to its ( 2p)@xmath9 core hole @xcite .",
    "crucial in reaching the bec phase transition is a large ratio of `` good '' to `` bad '' collisions , i.e. , a large value of the elastic collision rate characterized by the total cross section @xmath10 for elastic collisions with @xmath0 the @xmath11-wave scattering length , and a small rate for inelastic collisions and other loss processes .",
    "in addition , the creation of a stable bec requires a positive value of the scattering length . for metastable rare gas atoms , such as he@xmath1 and ne@xmath1 , the major loss process is penning ionization in binary collisions .",
    "fortunately , the latter process is suppressed in a sample of spin - polarized atoms @xcite . for he@xmath8 ,",
    "the suppression is very efficient : only spin flips due to magnetic interactions result in some residual ionization .",
    "theoretical predictions and recent experimental data on residual ionization are in good agreement .    for ne@xmath1 ,",
    "the anisotropy in the electrostatic interaction determines the magnitude of the residual ionization in a spin - polarized gas and has a profound influence on the value of the scattering length .",
    "theoretical estimates of the rate constant @xmath12 for residual ionization of ne@xmath8 predict a suppression of ionization by a factor in the range of @xmath13 @xcite , depending on the details of the interaction potentials . in experiments in hannover and eindhoven ,",
    "a lower limit on the suppression of ionization by a factor of @xmath14 has been confirmed , but so far no conclusive experimental data on the residual ionization rate of ne@xmath8 are available .",
    "in addition , the anisotropy in the interaction results in different interaction potentials @xmath15 for the molecular states @xmath16j , @xmath17 of the colliding ne@xmath1 atoms , with @xmath18 the absolute value of the projection of the total electronic angular momentum @xmath19 of the two colliding atoms on the internuclear axis . for binary collisions of spin - polarized ne@xmath1 , we have j=4 and @xmath20 through 4 , depending on the relative orientation of the atoms during the collision .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig : collisions ] , which shows two colliding atoms in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 state , respectively , with the electronic angular momentum @xmath23 and the ( 2p)@xmath9 orbital of the core hole indicated schematically .    because the scattering length is determined by the phase integral of the interaction potential , these different potentials @xmath24 for ne@xmath8 correspond to different scattering lengths @xmath25 .",
    "since there is no preference for a certain relative orientation of the atoms ( or @xmath26 state ) during the collision , even for spin - polarized ne@xmath1 , the elastic collision cross section will be determined by an effective overall scattering length @xmath0 , incorporating the behavior of all five @xmath18 states involved . among the species where bose - einstein condensation has been achieved",
    ", the bec candidate ne@xmath8 thus has a unique property .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the relation between the effective overall scattering length @xmath0 and the phase integrals @xmath27 of the potentials @xmath24 .",
    "although the potentials of ne@xmath8 are unknown at the level of accuracy needed to predict the value of the scattering length , it is useful to investigate the behavior of the effective scattering length as a function of the average value of the phase integral . in the following , we will refer to the effective overall scattering length simply as scattering length .",
    "a better understanding of the complex scattering length of ne@xmath8 is crucial in determining the feasibility of achieving bec with ne@xmath8 .",
    "important questions that need to be answered to determine the feasibility for achieving bec are : ( 1 ) is there a larger probability of encountering positive values of the scattering length , as compared to the 75% probability for the single potential case ?",
    "( 2 ) what is the probability for finding a sufficiently large elastic total cross section for efficient evaporative cooling ? ( 3 ) how does the availability of two bosonic isotopes of ne@xmath1 , @xmath28ne@xmath8 and @xmath29ne@xmath8 ( with a natural abundance of @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath14 @xmath32 , respectively ) influence these chances ?    the values of the rate constant for residual ionization @xmath12 and the scattering length @xmath0 which we need to achieve bec with ne@xmath1 for typical experimental conditions in our experiment , are summarized in fig .",

    "[ fig : combi]a ) we have plotted the phase integrals @xmath139 at which a resonance in @xmath0 occurs as a function of @xmath201 for @xmath212 .",
    "both resonance positions vary proportional to @xmath201 with a slope equal to @xmath213 , and with broad avoided crossing between them at @xmath214 , with @xmath215 .",
    "they are strongly coupled , which is also reflected in the behavior of the width of the resonances @xmath216 ( figure [ fig : combi]c ) ) , which varies as a sine ( broken line ) between @xmath217 and @xmath137 . at the avoided crossings",
    "the widths of the resonances become equal .",
    "the total width of both resonances combined @xmath218 is conserved , but one resonance is wide while the other is narrow .",
    "this periodic change in the resonance width is due to the periodic change in the coupling of both quasi - bound states to the incoming @xmath165 channel with changing @xmath139 .",
    "the weakly coupled case can be illustrated by reducing the value of @xmath73 , because in the absence of an induced dipole - dipole interaction @xmath90 no coupling between the quasi - bound states is possible .",
    "this can be understood in the following way . with a decreasing dipole - dipole interaction",
    "the rotational energy barrier increases both in height and width . as a result ,",
    "the region around @xmath78 in which rotational coupling between the different @xmath18 states takes place decreases and eventually vanishes .",
    "figure [ fig : combi ] b ) and d ) show the resonance positions and widths for a vanishing value of @xmath73 , simulated by assuming a modified value @xmath219 .",
    "one resonance position remains constant , while the other varies proportional to @xmath201 and the widths of the resonances are small and remain constant , except at the avoided crossing where they approach each other .",
    "this is the behavior seen for some of the resonances in @xmath0 for @xmath59 and is qualitatively the same as the behavior of the resonance positions and widths in the dis model , where coupling between the quasi - bound states is not taken into account .",
    "elastic collisions between spin - polarized ne@xmath1 atoms are governed by multiple interaction potentials .",
    "this unique property of ne@xmath1 among the bec species and candidates is a result of the anisotropic interaction between them .",
    "both simple analytical and full quantum mechanical calculations of the scattering length @xmath0 of ne@xmath1 show that the resulting scattering length has five resonances .",
    "a simple gas - kinetic picture yields very favorable but unrealistic results for the elastic collision cross section that are not compatible with the numerical calculations .",
    "this approach is only valid for an incoherent mixture of @xmath18 states .",
    "comparison between the numerical results and the dis model reveals that @xmath0 is also not simply a weighted average over the single potential resonances @xmath56 and that the resonances in @xmath0 can not be assigned to a single @xmath18 state .",
    "although the dis approach assumes a coherent mixture of @xmath18 states , coupling between the quasi - bound states is not taken into account , and it therefore does not describe the ne@xmath1 system accurately . the overall behavior of @xmath0 is similar to that of the usual single potential scattering length : neither the probability for encountering a positive or a large value of @xmath0 is enhanced by the presence of five instead of one resonances .",
    "the presence of an induced dipole - dipole interaction leads to strong coupling between the different @xmath18 states and causes a broadening of the resonances , resulting in quasi - bound states that are a linear combination of different @xmath3 states .",
    "this coupling between the different @xmath3 states in turn leads to the inhomogeneous shift of the resonance positions and widths in the quantum mechanical calculation as compared to the dis approach .",
    "however , the dependence of the resonance positions and widths on the input potentials is quite straightforward .",
    "the resonance positions vary either directly proportional to the relative phase differences between the @xmath18 potentials or not at all , depending on the exact composition of its quasi - bound state . the width of the strongly coupled resonances ( whose positions vary @xmath204 ) is determined by the coupling to the ingoing channel , which varies periodically with @xmath201 . the width of the weakly coupled resonances ( whose positions do not vary with @xmath201 ) is constant , since the coupling to the ingoing channel does not change .",
    "the total change in all five resonance positions is always equal to @xmath220 and the total width is conserved .",
    "the possibility to choose between the two bosonic isotopes of ne@xmath1 to optimize the value of the elastic cross section , greatly enhances the prospects for achieving bec with ne@xmath1 ( table [ tab : semiclassical ] ) .",
    "large beam fluxes of both bosonic isotopes , crucial in obtaining favorable initial conditions for efficient evaporative cooling , have been realized at the eindhoven experiment @xcite , therefore choosing the isotope with the most favorable scattering length is feasible .",
