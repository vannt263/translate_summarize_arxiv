    "qualitative dynamical behaviour of a classical system is characterized by the sensitivity of its orbits with respect to initial conditions .",
    "the sensitivity also changes with parameters of the system . if an orbit is not sensitive to initial conditions , the underlying dynamics is regular . on the other hand , for chaotic dynamics",
    "the orbit is highly sensitive to initial condition .",
    "lyapunov exponents , which measure the rate of exponential divergence of two initially close orbits , is zero for the regular case and positive for the chaotic case .",
    "an analogous classification of dynamics is not possible in the quantum domain , since quantum theory does not accommodate the very concept of orbits .    if we associate two localized wave packets which are initially close - by in state space , overlap of these states remain invariant under unitary quantum evolution .",
    "the corresponding classical liouville evolution of phase space densities is also a linear unitary one , but the ability to develop structures on infinitesimal scales , without the restrictions of the uncertainty principle , coexists with underlying orbit chaos . in the quantum mechanical case exponential instability of for instance the wave packet center is seen for quantized chaotic systems over a short time scale , corresponding to the ehrenfest time scale .",
    "one approach to quantify quantum sensitivity was initiated a while back by peres @xcite who proposed the overlap of states that are evolved from the same initial state @xmath0 under two hamiltonians differing by a small perturbation .",
    "the overlap intensity , also known as fidelity , is defined as    @xmath1    where @xmath2 represents the hamiltonian of an unperturbed system , @xmath3 represents the perturbed system and @xmath4 is the perturbation parameter .",
    "fidelity has evoked enormous interest in recent years with different interpretations .",
    "it is a measure of quantum irreversibility in the context of decoherence when the system under investigation interacts with a classically chaotic environment @xcite .",
    "it is realized as polarization echo in nuclear magnetic resonance , measuring the irreversibility in many body quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "it also characterizes the loss of phase coherence in quantum computation @xcite .",
    "initial investigations by peres @xcite show that @xmath5 is appreciable ( on a time average ) and its fluctuations are more for the regular case than for the chaotic case .",
    "some of the recent studies have focused on the decay rate of @xmath5 for chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "more investigations on this topic show that while the fidelity decays on time scale @xmath6 for chaotic systems , it decays on shorter time scale @xmath7 for integrable systems @xcite . in @xcite the decay for integrable system",
    "is shown to have power - law behaviour .    in this paper , using perturbative approximations , we relate recurrence time of the quantum fidelity to the classical period .",
    "this indicates that recurrence of quantum fidelity would be possible in nearly integrable systems . with the kicked rotor as a dynamical model",
    ", we examine this recurrence phenomena in detail .",
    "our numerical experiments also reveal that the evolution of fidelity exhibits a wide range of behaviour , depends on the choice of initial state .",
    "let us consider an unperturbed system @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the system parameter , satisfying the eigenvalue equation    @xmath10    let @xmath11 be the perturbed system where @xmath12 and @xmath4 is the perturbation parameter",
    ". under a small perturbation , for the simplest zeroth order approximation to the fidelity it is sufficient to assume that the energy eigenvalues differ up to the first order of @xmath4 and the corresponding eigenstates remain unaffected .",
    "it is easy to see that the eigenstate changes contribute to the fidelity at an order @xmath4 .",
    "that is the approximation we can make for the calculation of fidelity amounts to the approximation :    @xmath13    here @xmath14 measures the rate at which @xmath15th level changes with the parameter .",
    "it is also known in the literature as level velocity wherein the parameter is thought of as pseudo - time . in this approximation",
    "the fidelity can be written as    @xmath16\\right|^2\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath18 and we are interested in the time evolution of the fidelity . assuming that the weighting probabilities @xmath19 are strongly centered around a mean @xmath20 , one can expand @xmath14 using taylor series in @xmath15 around @xmath20 up to the first - order correction as    @xmath21    this gives the recurrence time    @xmath22    such that the fidelity becomes unity when @xmath23 is an integer multiples of @xmath24 . recollecting that the classical action @xmath25 is quantized as @xmath26 ,    @xmath27    in terms of @xmath28 , the period of the classical orbit underlying the coherent state @xmath0 , the recurrence time is thus given by a combination of simple perturbative and semiclassical approximations as    @xmath29    thus the recurrence time of quantum fidelity",

    "according to the above relation , the quantum fidelity for the harmonic oscillator    @xmath30    with a classical period @xmath31 recurs at    @xmath32    this recurrence time can also be obtained from the underlying classical dynamics by evolving an initial phase space density @xmath33 which satisfies the normalization condition    @xmath34    analogous to the quantum fidelity , we define normalized classical fidelity as    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the final phase space density which is obtained from forward time evolution of the initial density for a time @xmath23 with the frequency being @xmath9 , followed by backward time evolution for the same time @xmath23 with the frequency set as @xmath37 . the classical fidelity measures",

    "finally , we move on to the rotational kam region of the phase space . a typical evolution of an initial state localized in this region is shown in fig .",
    "as expected , perturbative approximation fails and there are no signatures of fidelity recurrence .",
    "although classical motion on the kam tori is regular , we notice that quantum - classical correspondence is seen only for a short time . this may be due to enhanced quantum interference in this region of energetic rotational motion .",

    "we have shown that , within the framework of simple perturbative and semiclassical approximations , recurrence time of quantum fidelity is related to period of the classical motion . in the case of the harmonic oscillator , fidelity recurs at @xmath128 where @xmath4 is the perturbation parameter . invoking the kicked rotor as an example ,",
