    "magnetars are manifestations of isolated neutron stars . commonly known as soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) ,",
    "magnetars are generally characterized by relatively slow spin periods ( in a narrow range of @xmath4s ) , rapid spin - down rates ( @xmath5ss@xmath6 ) , and intense x - ray bursts with luminosities anywhere between @xmath7ergs@xmath6 .",
    "dipole magnetic field strengths of these sources , as inferred from their spin periods and spin - down rates , are in the order of @xmath8 g @xcite , which are in perfect agreement with the predictions of the magnetar model that there exist isolated neutron stars , which are powered by their own extremely strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "magnetars are persistent x - ray emitters in quiescence most of the time at luminosity levels around @xmath9ergs@xmath6 .",
    "as they enter active episodes , they usually exhibit significant variations in their persistent emission spectral and temporal behavior in conjunction with the outburst onset @xcite .",
    "transient magnetars are generally undetectable unless they undergo outbursts , during which their x - ray fluxes are enhanced by factors of a few @xmath10 , followed by a gradual decay over timescales of months to years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typical magnetar bursts are short , lasting only for @xmath11ms , with a peak luminosity lower than @xmath12ergs@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "more energetic bursts occur much less frequently and have been observed only from five sgr sources @xcite . for reviews on magnetars , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both persistent x - ray emission and bursts are attributed to the decay of extremely strong magnetic fields in the framework of the magnetar model @xcite .",
    "however , it is not trivial to describe the observed data with detailed physical models , considering that the radiation ought to emerge from the strong magnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "the persistent x - ray spectrum of magnetars is usually fitted with phenomenological models : either the combination of a blackbody and a power law ( see section 14.3.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or two blackbody components @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite studied the persistent emission spectra with an idealized physical model , the surface thermal emission and magnetospheric scattering ( stems ) . the stems model accounts for the transport of radiation in a fully ionized and extremely magnetized atmosphere @xcite as well as for resonant cyclotron scattering ( rcs ) @xcite of photons emerging from the surface in the magnetosphere of the magnetar ( see also section [ sec : mo ] ) .",
    "a typical magnetar burst mainly emits radiation up to 100kev .",
    "its spectrum is well described phenomenologically by the sum of two blackbody functions with temperatures of @xmath133 and @xmath1312 kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to physically describe the burst spectra",
    ", @xcite introduced analytically the shape of a thermalised spectrum modified by a strong magnetic field ( @xmath8 g ) .",
    "we use here the latter model in our burst spectral analysis .    emitted a series of short x - ray / soft @xmath14ray bursts for almost two weeks starting on 2008 august 22 ; several tens of events",

    "we introduce for the first time the rcs process into the modified thermal burst emission , to study the burst spectra below 10kev from .",
    "we also analyze the persistent emission of with the stems model , and investigate whether there exists a link between the persistent emission and the dim burst spectra assuming the same scattering process .",
    "we describe the physical models used for the persistent emission and burst spectra in section [ sec : mo ] . in section [ sec : obs ] , we describe the analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ data used here , and present the results of our spectral studies in section [ sec : specresult ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the interpretation of these results in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "in the magnetar model , the quiescent x - ray emission could originate from the neutron star surface heating by the decay of the strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "persistent emission photons ought to go through the atmosphere and magnetosphere of the highly magnetized neutron star before they escape .",
    "the transport of radiation for different polarization modes was investigated in detail in a series of studies considering the effects of absorption , emission , and scattering by the fully ionized plasma @xcite .",
    "these showed that as photons propagate from the inner to the outer layers of a magnetized atmosphere , the spectrum of the emergent emission becomes harder than the original blackbody shape .",
    "as the photons reach the magnetosphere , resonant cyclotron scattering could effectively modify their spectrum @xcite .",
    "this process will again make the spectrum harder , by scattering the low energy photons to higher energies .",
    "@xcite calculated the simplified one dimensional resonant cyclotron scattering of a planck spectrum by a non - relativistic warm plasma in an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "applying the same scattering process to the emission from the atmosphere , @xcite developed the surface thermal emission and magnetospheric scattering model ( stems ) .",
    "they then used this model to successfully describe the persistent emission spectra of xtej1810@xmath24197 and 4u0142@xmath2561 , and also estimate the surface magnetic fields of these two magnetars .",
    "the stems model depends on four parameters : the surface magnetic field ( @xmath26 ) , the temperature of the neutron star ( @xmath27 ) , the temperature of the plasma in the magnetosphere ( @xmath28 ) , and the optical depth for resonant cyclotron scattering ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "because of the strong gravitational field of the neutron star , the stems model also includes a fixed gravitational redshift ( @xmath30 ) parameter , which depends only on the ratio of mass over radius of a neutron star .",
    "we fixed @xmath31 throughout this paper , corresponding to a typical neutron star with mass of @xmath32 and radius of 10 km .",
    "one of the mechanisms invoked for the origin of the short duration magnetar bursts is the sudden release of energy by cracking of the magnetically strained neutron star crust @xcite .",
    "this sudden energy release creates a hot pair plasma , which then becomes trapped in the magnetosphere forming a bubble with large optical depth @xcite .",
    "the photons need to go through multiple scatterings to escape the bubble , thereby thermalizing the burst radiation @xcite . unlike in the case of the persistent surface emission for which the absorption , emission and scattering are important",
    ", scattering is the most dominant process in the burst bubble @xcite .",
    "taking into account the fact that photons with different energies would have different scattering cross - sections , @xcite calculated the radiation transfer for the magnetar bursts .",
    "the resulting spectral shape has a much flatter low energy distribution compared with the equilibrium blackbody spectrum ( hereafter we call the resulting shape as the modified blackbody ) .",
    "the modified blackbody photons are also subject to multiple scatterings as they go through the magnetosphere .",
    "we adopted the same process of the resonant cyclotron scattering as used in @xcite and @xcite to up - scatter the modified blackbody burst spectrum .",
    "the scattered modified blackbody and the planckian function differ significantly at energies below the bolometric temperature ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the softer emission is highly affected by the interstellar absorption , which would make the two models indistinguishable if the source were towards a high interstellar @xmath23 region .",
    "the location of makes it , therefore , an excellent source to determine the nature of its burst emission mechanism .",
    "we generated a numerical grid for the modified blackbody with the resonant cyclotron scattering ( mbb@xmath25rcs ) to fit the burst spectral data in xspec @xcite .",
    "the mbb@xmath25rcs model has three free parameters : the bolometric temperature of the bubble ( @xmath34 ) which was allowed to range between @xmath35kev , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 as defined in section 2.1 .",
    "we also used the same gravitational redshift parameter ( @xmath31 ) while fitting the burst spectra .",

    "observatory @xcite in seven occasions between august and september 2008 . here",
    ", we selected only the first observation performed on 2008 august 23 ( observation i d : 0560191501 ) , the most burst active day of the source , to study the spectral properties of the bursts and of the underlying persistent emission at the same time .",
    "the observation lasting for 48.9ks was performed in the small window mode of the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) pn instrument @xcite , allowing a temporal resolution of 6 ms .",
    "we processed the data using sas version 11.0.0 with the latest calibration files generated on 2012 may 18 .",
    "we identified and removed events in the piled - up time intervals ( 64 s in total ) , which are the ones with count rates over 50 countss@xmath6 , from the source event list .",
    "we then constructed the source lightcurve with 100ms binsize as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the average count rate of the persistent emission is @xmath36 countss@xmath6 , corresponding to no more than 5.5 counts per bin in the light curve of figure 1 ( or a count rate of 55 countss@xmath6 ) .",
    "we assumed that a bin contained a burst if it exceeded the persistent x - ray emission level by at least @xmath37 , corresponding to @xmath38 counts per bin ( or a count rate of 100 countss@xmath6 ) .",
    "we , therefore , accumulated the persistent emission spectrum using 100ms time bins with count rate less than 50 countss@xmath6 , and the burst spectra from those bins with over 100 countss@xmath6 .",
    "the total exposure time of the persistent emission spectrum is 32.7 ks .",
    "there are 129 identified bursts having 100ms peak count rates between 100 and 500 countss@xmath6 ; the total time encompassed by these bursts was 8.7 s. we combined all 129 burst data into one stacked spectrum and regrouped the resulting spectra to have a minimum of 15 counts in each spectral bin , making sure that we kept the bin size within the spectral resolution of the instrument .",

    "however , the uniqueness of the stems model is the fact that it takes into account the presence of the strong surface magnetic field and its possible effect on the emergent spectrum via atmospheric processes .",
    "using stems we obtain , for the first time , the surface magnetic field strength of via x - ray spectroscopy , as @xmath9910@xmath100 g , a value which agrees well with the inferred equatorial dipole field strength of 2@xmath8910@xmath100 g @xcite .    the stems model has already been used to study the persistent emission spectra of four axps , xtej@xmath101 , 4u0142@xmath2561 , 1e@xmath102 and 1rxsj@xmath103 @xcite , and four sgrs , sgr@xmath104 , sgr@xmath105 , sgr@xmath106 and sgrj@xmath107 @xcite . in most cases , including , the surface magnetic field obtained from x - ray spectroscopy is consistent with the dipole magnetic field inferred from the spin period and the spin down rate , as shown in figure [ bfield ] . because magnetars emit energetic bursts , their surface magnetic field strengths are expected to be in the @xmath108 g domain .",
    "some sources , however , may have lower inferred dipole magnetic field strengths @xcite , although higher order magnetic structures ( multipolar fields ) may be present @xcite . the similarity between the surface magnetic field strengths of as obtained via x - ray spectroscopy and as inferred from the spin properties suggests that its surface magnetic field topology is close to a dipole .",
    "we also studied here , for the first time , the dimmest bursts and their physical link to the persistent x - ray emission as both kinds of emission are redistributed by resonant cyclotron scattering process in the magnetosphere .",
    "the burst spectrum can be described with a warm bubble trapped by the magnetosphere , emitting thermal radiation modified by a strong magnetic field .",

    "suzaku_. they fit both spectra with two blackbody functions and a power law model . comparing the parameters of these fits , @xcite concluded that the persistent emission and the dim bursts have the same emission mechanisms .",
    "they further suggested that the persistent emission of magnetars may be composed of numerous microbursts .",
    "we find that both kinds of emission are forms of modified thermal emission and redistributed by the resonant cyclotron scattering in the magnetosphere .",
    "however , the spectral shapes of the thermally dominated portion ( @xmath1184 kev ) of the stems and mbb+rcs models are remarkably different and they yield significantly different temperatures .",
    "we , therefore , argue against the idea that the persistent and burst emissions have a common origin .",
    "the main difference between the two is that the scattering is the dominant process in the burst bubble , while for the persistent emission , one needs to consider not only the scattering but also the emission and absorption processes as photons travel through the magnetar atmosphere .",

    "<S> we present here a detailed spectral study of the x - ray emission of the persistent source and the low - fluence bursts of observed during a deep _ xmm - newton _ observation near the peak of its 2008 outburst . for the persistent emission </S>",
    "<S> we employ a physically motivated continuum emission model and spectroscopically determine important source properties ; such as , the surface magnetic field strength and the magnetospheric scattering optical depth . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the magnetar surface temperature near the peak of its activity is @xmath0 kev , corresponding to an emission area of 131km@xmath1 at a distance of 2kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the surface magnetic field strength determined spectroscopically , @xmath2 g , is consistent with the dipole field strength inferred from the source spin and spin down rate . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the stacked spectra of 129 very faint bursts with a modified blackbody model and find a temperature of @xmath3 kev , corresponding to an emission area of 93km@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find an evidence for cooling during the burst decay phase . </S>"
