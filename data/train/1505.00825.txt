    "in particular , @xcite claimed it was not energetically feasible .",
    "however , the sub - structure present within massive halos can induce collisionless scattering of dark matter particles within the centre , flattening the inner cusp without the need of baryons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "alternative models to @xmath4cdm have been also been suggested , such as ` warm ' dark matter ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or ( non - gravitational ) dark matter self - interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "+ @xcite argued that cyclic star formation bursts within the centres of dark matter halos could provide the necessary energy to re - shape the dark matter cusp into a dark matter core . in this model , feedback from type ii supernovae ( sne ) periodically drives bulk gas motions in the star forming regions in the central kpc of dwarf galaxies .",
    "since gas can dominate the central gravitational field , these bulk motions can significantly perturb the central gravitational potential on timescales comparable to dark matter orbital times leading to an efficient transfer of kinetic energy to the central dark matter distribution and the formation of a significant dark matter core .",
    "a notable feature of the @xcite framework was that the gas need not be expelled or even pushed very far outside the core - forming region ( as opposed to the impulsive blow - out scheme e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite gave an analytical description of how changing the dominate potential leads to irreversible heating of the dark matter orbits .",
    "+ the mechanism was first verified in a cosmological simulation by @xcite . a required feature for simulations to flatten cusps",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the process also has consequences for other collisionless components such as stars and star clusters .",
    "initially centrally concentrated populations ( such as younger stars ) are pushed outward over time , leading to older populations having larger orbits on average .",
    "this results in a broad match to observations of the stellar content of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". it also has interesting consequences for multiple populations in galactic globular clusters @xcite .",
    "+ @xcite made the first analytical estimate of the energy difference between cored and cuspy dark matter halos of the same mass , finding that sne alone would have difficulty providing the energy required to form dark matter cores given the average stellar masses of dwarf galaxies .",
    "though there are other sources of energy available from star formation , such as stellar winds and the ionizing flux from young stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not clear that this added energy would be sufficient to remove the discrepancy or couple as well as sne - driven bulk gas motions .",
    "however , the @xcite results are difficult to reconcile with the core forming simulations which typically employ feedback only from sne ( and with realistic efficiencies ) .",
    "+ in this work we re - examine the energy requirements and show that the formation of dark matter cores is energetically plausible in a @xmath4cdm cosmology .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . ",
    "[ sec : amb ] deals with the ambiguity inherent in the definition of a core size , and argues for a new , general way to define the core radius . in  [ sec : cfeb ] we discuss the energy required to form dark matter cores in halos that were initially cuspy using assumptions that are more consistent with our understanding of how the process operates . in  [ sec : results ] we show predictions for core sizes in dark matter halos and examine the implications for observed systems such as fornax .",
    "many observed cores in dwarf galaxies are inferred from the rotation profiles of the stars and gas by finding the best - fit dark - matter density model ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "commonly , one would use either a cored isothermal sphere , whose density profile goes as @xmath6 at large radii , or that proposed by @xcite where the density goes as @xmath7 at large radii , @xmath8 both satisfy the requirement that the density profile transitions to a flat core within a scale radius . without probing the rotation profile to large radii it is difficult to determine which density profile is the best fit .",
    "the cored isothermal profile predicts a constant velocity at large radii while the @xcite profile looks like the standard galaxy rotation curve ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the common practice of defining the core size as the scale radius leads to large variations in core radii dependent on the chosen functional form . + to avoid this ambiguity , we define the core radius as _ the radius , @xmath9 , at which the logarithmic slope of the density profile satisfies _ : @xmath10 we will use this definition from now on when referring to the core size . characterizing cores this way",
    "is consistent with the density profile slopes found in simulations of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and with the mass profile slopes observed in local group dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the simulated galaxies always transition to a density profile with a strongly negative slope ( @xmath11 ) beyond a few kpc where the effects of baryonic feedback are limited .",
    "this definition of the core radius lessens the reliance on an assumed dark matter density distribution , and it can be determined directly from the velocity profile .",
    "it is also straightforward to relate @xmath12  ( for any given density profile ) to @xmath9 .",
    "+ to demonstrate the robustness of our new core definition , and to illustrate the ambiguity with using the scale radius , we show in figure [ fig : kdn ] the rotational velocity profile for the low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxy ngc 959 from @xcite .",
    "these authors assumed a cored isothermal density profile , and the best fit of this profile to the data is shown as the solid line .",
    "although it is perfectly sufficient to match the profile in the inner 12kpc , it does not roll over sufficiently to match the slope in the outer part of a cosmological halo .",
    "we have also fit three other density profiles .",
    "the first , shown as the dotted line in the figure , is ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* fixed in the figure ) : @xmath13 the second , shown as the dashed line , is a pseudo - isothermal profile , where we let the power index vary : @xmath14",

    "[ eq : rhoburk ] ) profile as the dash - dot line .",
    "+ the differences between the three rotation profile fits are only evident at radii past the furthest observable point , where the predicted rotation velocity rolls over .",
    "we have also done this for the eight other lsbs from @xcite ( see the appendix ) , and the resulting scale radii and core radii are shown in table [ tab : kdnm ] .",
    "it is evident that velocity rotation data alone are not sufficient to distinguish the best fit dark matter density profile .",
    "each fitting function requires a different scale radius , the common definition of the core size .",
    "however , using @xmath15 to define the core radius leads to consistent core sizes , independent of which of the four density profiles was used , so long as the core location is comfortably within the range of data points .",

[ eq : rhocore ] ) and the nfw profile lead to well defined values for @xmath66 .",

    "furthermore , moving the cusp mass to near the virial radius of the halo leads to a core formation energy budget from equations and which will be significantly overestimated compared with the more restricted redistribution considered here ( @xmath69@xmath70 @xmath67 ) .",
    "+ the motivation for constraining the mass and density profiles of the pre- and post - core halos outside @xmath69  to be the same is simply that we expect that strong coupling of star formation feedback to dark matter is only effective in , and only modifies , the central parts of the halo .",

    "since we may write approximately : @xmath80 for the cored profile , we see , as expected , that the parameter that most influences the energy required to convert a cusp into a core is @xmath81 . a larger core moves more mass to larger radii and thus requires more energy to redistribute it from the cusp . on the other hand , if we allow @xmath69  to scale as a fixed fraction of @xmath67  ( we chose @xmath69/@xmath67=1/6 ) , we find that @xmath59  scales as @xmath0@xmath82 .",
    "this scaling is shown by the solid black line in figure [ fig : halocomp ] and lies within the range of solutions calculated by @xcite ( the gray shaded region in the figure ) . a more realistic estimate for @xmath69 , as a small multiple of @xmath9  ( here 3 ) , leads to a greatly reduced energy requirement and a much shallower dependence on halo mass .",

    "+ in reality , not all of the sne energy will couple to the cusp dark matter through the induced perturbations to the gravitational potential .",

    ". only for @xmath90 would there be no possibility of creating a core larger than 250pc in the 10@xmath9110@xmath72  halo range .",
    "the implication is that most , if not all , dwarf galaxies should host dark matter cores if their central star formation rate was high enough to generate 10@xmath9210@xmath93  in stars .",
    "+      in the previous section we showed that stellar feedback , of which we have only considered sne , can provide enough energy to the dense star forming gas in the centres of dwarf galaxies to transform the dark matter cusps predicted by numerical experiments to the flattened dark matter cores inferred from observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is contrary to previous work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and results from our adoption of a more consistent mass normalisation criterion .",
    "this was motivated in part by the results of hydrodynamic simulations and by the observation that the most efficient injection of star formation feedback energy will occur at the deepest point in the galactic potential , which implies a physical limit to the radius to which cusp dark matter can be redistributed . in our calculations",
    ", we have parameterized this limit as the radius @xmath69 .",
    "our results suggest significant dark matter cores can be formed with less than 1% of the total sne energy available over the star forming history of a typical dwarf galaxy .",
    "+ so far we have been concerned with whether a dark matter core can form in an initially cuspy halo due to star formation feedback .",
    "our new calculations allow us to ask a more interesting question : what is the typical core size for a given halo mass ?",
    "in figure [ fig : halocore ] we show the predicted core size as a function of halo mass using the three @xmath86-@xmath0  relations shown in figure [ fig : halocomp ] and 100% of the associated sne energy .",
    "although figure [ fig : halocore ] reinforces our main conclusion that dark matter cores can form from cusps in even the smallest dwarf galaxy halos , it also emphasizes the uncertainty in trying to make detailed predictions .",
    "the variation in the low mass slope of the @xmath86-@xmath0  relation between the @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite results corresponds directly to a factor of 24 variation in predicted @xmath9  as a function of halo mass .",
    "furthermore , these relations only give the average stellar mass as a function of halo mass .",
    "+    figure [ fig : halocore ] is further complicated because we have not yet considered the efficiency with which the energy from stellar feedback is transferred to dark matter particle orbits .",
    "the coupling efficiency will likely vary in time with changing conditions in the centre of the halo , and will depend on the star formation rate , gas accretion rate , gas heating rate , and the dark matter particle orbits ; the value of @xmath89 used in @xcite is merely a time - averaged value over the dwarf galaxy star formation and gas accretion histories . finally , our results show that the energy required to form the core , @xmath59 , has only a weak dependence on @xmath0  for a given @xmath9 .",
    "+ if , indeed , our ansatz that matter redistribution happens only within @xmath69  is correct , then the total halo mass @xmath0  has only a modest influence on the final core sizes in dwarf galaxies .",
    "many observations of dwarf galaxies in the local universe can only measure dynamical masses out to a few kpc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and so can not accurately determine the halo virial mass .",
    "this leads us to figure [ fig : stellarcore ] where we have plotted the range of core sizes as a function of stellar mass required to produce a core of that size , _ without _ adopting a specific coupling efficiency in dark matter core formation .",
    "each curve represents the track in @xmath9-@xmath86  space for each halo mass , and is determined by the relations between @xmath0 , @xmath67 , and @xmath12  ( or concentration parameter ) .",
    "the endpoints of each curve represent the upper and lower limits that we imposed when computing the energy requirements from equation .",
    "+ in this figure , the efficiency @xmath89 is equivalent to sliding a given dwarf galaxy along the @xmath86  axis . to illustrate this",
    ", we show the local group dwarf fornax , whose stellar mass was taken from @xcite and whose dark matter core size was measured by @xcite .",
    "fornax lies significantly below the predicted core size for its stellar mass at 100% efficiency , but is consistent with our core predictions if only a few per cent of the total sne budget contributed to the formation of the dark matter core in the host halo .",
    "fornax s host halo could range anywhere from 10@xmath9110@xmath94  while @xmath89 could range anywhere from 0.11% .",
    "in this paper we presented a new estimate for the energy requirement for galaxies to form dark matter cores in their host halos .",
    "we assume former cusp material remains within a characteristic radius , @xmath69 , at which both the density and mass profiles of the cored dark matter halo and the original cusped halo match .",
    "this significantly reduces the amount of energy required compared to the estimate of @xcite without having to require , for example , that cores form only at high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our results suggest that dark matter cores are present in most , if not all , dark matter halos that experienced clustered star formation within their centres @xcite . in the case of the local group dwarf galaxy fornax ,",
    "if it lives in a @xmath3  halo then less than 1% of the energy released by all supernovae over its star formation history would be required to build a 1 kpc core .",
    "+ our new calculations alleviate another potential problem raised by @xcite : the accretion of additional high phase - space density collisionless particles ( cuspy satellites ) was shown by @xcite to tend to preserve the steepest density cusp in the merger .",
    "however , if all large halos merging in the collisionless mass assembly process are already cored , the dark matter density profile of the merger remnant should be cored as well .",
    "while the smallest accretors , common at early times , may be cuspy and rebuild a central cusp , subsequent star formation feedback should be enough to destroy the dark matter cusp in a short timemyr . ] .",
    "+ with the apparent tension between @xmath4cdm and the presence of cores in dwarf galaxies relieved , we can now focus on making firm predictions of the sizes of dark matter cores as a function of stellar mass ( figure [ fig : stellarcore ] ) . for example , simulations of dark matter core formation in dwarf galaxies can test the efficiency and energy output of star formation prescriptions . the resulting density profiles and other properties",
    "can be directly compared to observations of local dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the bursty star formation at the centres of dwarf galaxies should be able to drive @xmath89 high enough to form a sizeable core @xcite at high redshift @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : kdnm ] repeats the analysis shown in figure [ fig : kdn ] for all nine low surface brightness galaxies observed by @xcite .    [",

    "we determine the best fit by finding the minimum in the square of the velocity residual , @xmath95 : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the velocity residual at each measured radius and @xmath98 is the measured velocity error from @xcite .",
    "if the density models used in the text were linear in the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath99 , and @xmath77 , the uncertainties could be derived by using the @xmath100 probability distribution to determine confidence levels .",
    "since this is not the case , the probability distribution of @xmath95 can not simply be approximated to that of @xmath100 . instead , we compute an uncertainty contour given by : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the number of free parameters",
    " two for equations and and one for equation  since the central density is fixed . in figure",
    "[ fig : kdnc ] , these contours are shown by the solid black and gray lines for equations and , respectively , for the sample of nine galaxies from @xcite .",
    "velocity data points that showed large variations from the expected velocity profile were ignored when computing the error contours ; these are shown as open circles in figure [ fig : kdnm ] .",
    "the location of the minimum @xmath95 for each are given by the filled triangles . for most of these galaxies , minimizing the residuals gives relatively tight constraints on the scale radius and power index for the density profiles .",
    "however , ugc 4325 and ddo 64 do not have closed contours , which is unsurprising given that constraining @xmath12  requires the velocity profile to begin to turn over  traits that are not exhibited in the velocity data for these galaxies .",
    "instead , we can only define acceptable lower limits for the density profile parameters ."
