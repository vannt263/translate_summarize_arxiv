    "the spread of epidemics can be considered to occur on networks that describe contacts between individuals @xcite .",
    "the size and dynamics of epidemics heavily depend on the structure of the contact network .",
    "in particular , in networks in which the number of contacts per individual ( _ i.e. _ , the degree ) is heterogeneous , as represented by scale - free networks , epidemic spreading can occur on a large scale even at a small infection rate @xcite .    given a limited dose of immunization , it is practically necessary to establish efficient immunization strategies against epidemics occurring on networks .",
    "if an appropriate ordering of immunization of nodes in a network is followed , the potential risk of large - scale epidemic spreading can be suppressed .",
    "we measure the efficiency of immunization by assessing the capability of the immunization strategy to fragment the network into small parts with a small number of sequentially removed nodes .",
    "this method of assessment has a wide applicability beyond prevention of epidemics . in ecology , it is important to identify the nodes in a food web whose removal causes the catastrophic disintegration of the food web , which would seriously damage the ecosystem @xcite .",
    "the possibility of efficient immunization of a network also implies that the network is vulnerable to intentional attacks such as those attributable to terrorism @xcite .",
    "the standard solution to an immunization problem is to immunize hubs ( _ i.e. _ , nodes having large degrees ) preferentially @xcite .",
    "the degree - based immunization strategy and its variants are very efficient for scale - free network models and some real data @xcite . however , many real networks are more structured than merely having heterogeneous degree distributions . partly because of this factor ,",

    "nodes in a network with modular structure are partitioned into multiple modules ( also called communities ) such that the number of links connecting the nodes in the same module is relatively large .",

    "such networks abound in various fields @xcite . in simple cases",
    "in which modules are homogeneous and of equal size , epidemic dynamics @xcite and immunization @xcite have been mathematically analyzed in the limit of the infinite network size .",

    "metapopulation modeling is a promising approach to the understanding of epidemic dynamics in such modular networks @xcite .",
    "establishing practical immunization strategies for general modular networks is an important issue .",
    "we develop an immunization strategy for modular networks by extending an analytical framework proposed recently @xcite .",
    "it is our contention that it is important to consider the role of each node in the coarse - grained network among modules rather than in the original network so as to preferentially immunize nodes that bridge important modules .",
    "some algorithms for community detection effectively solve the same problem @xcite .",
    "we believe that our method is much less computationally expensive than these methods and therefore is suitable for large modular networks .",
    "consider an undirected and unweighted contact network with @xmath0 nodes . even though our results can be easily extended to the case of weighted networks , this study is confined to the immunization of unweighted networks for simplicity .",
    "an immunization strategy is an ordering of all the nodes in a network according to which the nodes are removed .",
    "the fraction of the removed nodes is set equal to @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) ; the fraction of the remaining nodes is equal to @xmath3 .",

    "i.e. _ , with a large @xmath3 .",
    "restrepo and colleagues proposed an immunization strategy based on the so - called dynamical importance of nodes @xcite . although the dynamical importance is defined for directed networks @xcite , the exposition of their results in this section is concerned with the undirected version .",
    "the adjacency matrix is denoted by @xmath5 ; @xmath6 when node @xmath7 and node @xmath8 are adjacent , and @xmath9 otherwise . because @xmath5 is a symmetric matrix , all the eigenvalues of @xmath5 are real .",

    "the lcc is large ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath12 ) if and only if @xmath10 exceeds unity @xcite . the perron vector @xmath11 is the mode that survives after multiplying @xmath5 repeatedly to an almost arbitrary initial @xmath0-dimensional vector . intuitively , the multiplication of @xmath5 implies the spread of epidemics to the nearest neighbors .",
    "a large @xmath10 implies the efficient expansion of the lcc .    when @xmath13 , we generate the effective adjacency matrix from the network composed of only the remaining nodes and the links among these nodes .",

    "when @xmath64 is small , a similar relation holds true . in this case ,",
    "the largest eigenvalue is not degenerated .",
    "however , for a moderate @xmath3 , the lcc tends to contain a majority of nodes in a single module and does not extend beyond the module .",
    "such a lcc is regarded to be large by the res strategy , whereas it is actually small when @xmath26 is large .    in summary ,",
    "the res strategy applied to modular networks may be inefficient , because it does not distinguish between local and global epidemics .",
    "the same is the case for degree - based immunization strategies in which hubs are preferentially immunized .",
    "if a considerable number of hubs contribute to intramodular but not to intermodular connectivity , alternative strategies may work better .",
    "even though we have dealt with networks with modules of equal size , the discussions above can also be applied to modular networks in which the size of modules is heterogeneous .",
    "we develop an immunization strategy that can be applied to modular networks . by definition , intermodular links are rare compared to intramodular links in a modular network .",
    "if intermodular links are preferentially removed during immunization , the modular structure will be preserved throughout the immunization procedure .",
    "therefore , if the lcc at a certain value of @xmath3 contains a considerable number of modules that are connected at this value of @xmath3 , many nodes in each of such modules are likely to belong to the lcc . on this basis , for simplicity , we assume that all the nodes in each module belong to the lcc or none of them belongs to the lcc . to establish an efficient immunization strategy for modular networks ,",
    "we apply the res strategy to the coarse - grained network representing the connectivity among modules .",
    "given a partition of nodes into @xmath26 modules , we define an @xmath31 coarse - grained adjacency matrix @xmath65 as @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the @xmath68th module .",
    "the matrix @xmath65 is weighted , and @xmath69 is equal to the number of links between @xmath67 and @xmath70 . it should be noted that @xmath71 is set to 0 to respect the assumption that all the nodes in a module are simultaneously included in or excluded from the lcc . otherwise , a localized mode such as @xmath72 may become the perron vector of @xmath65 , owing to which epidemics restricted to a single module can not be ruled out .",
    "the perron vector @xmath73 of @xmath65 is determined by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath76 represents the importance of the @xmath7th module in terms of the eigenvector centrality .",
    "we calculate the shift in @xmath75 , denoted by @xmath77 , owing to the removal of a single node @xmath14 .",
    "we denote the index of the module that node @xmath14 belongs to by @xmath78 . the removal of node @xmath14 elicits a change in the coarse - grained adjacency matrix by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the number of intermodular links that exist between node @xmath14 and module @xmath67 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath81 it should be noted that @xmath82 .    to calculate @xmath77 ,",

    "although this situation occurs after some nodes have been removed , it is not very common except near the percolation threshold .",
    "therefore , we assume that the node removal changes the perron vector to @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a small vector .",
    "we determine @xmath91 as follows .",
    "the @xmath78th linear equations for the perron vector before and after the removal of node @xmath14 are represented by @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively . by combining these equations and neglecting small - order terms @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) and @xmath96",

    "therefore , the contribution of the node removal to @xmath77 is attributed to two factors : the importance of the module that node @xmath14 belongs to ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath107 ) and the connectivity of node @xmath14 to other important modules ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath108 ) . as the other extreme to the case described above",

    "we have proposed an efficient algorithm called the mod strategy for immunizing networks with modular structure .",
    "this strategy combines a community detection algorithm and the identification of nodes with crucial intermodular links .",
    "we have validated the effectiveness of the mod strategy with artificial and real networks using two community detection algorithms .",
    "the mod strategy is applicable to networks in which the size of modules is heterogeneous , as is the case in real modular networks @xcite .",
    "the mod strategy can be extended to the case of networks with more than two hierarchical levels , which are often found in real data @xcite . in such a network , we first remove the nodes responsible for the formation of the most global connection . if modules at the most global level have been fragmented , we apply the community detection algorithm to each module such that the nodes responsible for connecting different submodules in a module are preferentially removed .    for networks with bipartite modular structure @xcite ,",
    "the mod strategy is inefficient .",
    "this is because the mod strategy is based on the conventional concept of modular structure , _",
    "i.e. _ , there are relatively more links within a module than across different modules .",
    "this property is not satisfied by networks with bipartite modular structure . dealing with bipartite modular structure and also overlapping modular structure ( see @xcite for a review )",
    "is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the mod strategy does not outperform the rb strategy .",
    "this is as expected because the rb strategy provides a useful algorithm for community detection @xcite .",
    "the heart of the algorithm lies in fragmenting a network into modules with a small number of links ( not nodes ) that are removed in the decreasing order of the betweenness centrality .",
    "however , carrying out community detection on the basis of the rb strategy @xcite is computationally formidable ; this strategy requires @xmath132 time for sparse networks .",
    "this fact has led to the development of faster algorithms for community detection that are independent of the recalculated betweenness centrality @xcite .",
    "the rb strategy of immunization also requires @xmath132 time .",
    "an immunization strategy developed by the adaptation of a faster community detection algorithm that sequentially removes links ( so - called divisive algorithms ) would outperform the mod strategies examined in the present study ( _ i.e. _ , mod - c , mod - b , and mod - r ) .",
    "however , such a community detection algorithm seems to be unknown @xcite .",
    "we state that the mod strategy outperforms the rb strategy when the network is large .",
    "we have implicitly used fast community detection algorithms so that the mod strategy performs faster than the rb strategy . for sparse networks ,",
    "rosvall s algorithm runs comfortably fast .",
    "clauset s algorithm runs faster than rosvall s algorithm on our data and requires only @xmath133 time @xcite .",
    "blondel s algorithm is even faster in general @xcite .    in the so - called out - of - the - neighborhood ( out ) immunization strategies",
    "@xcite , one picks a neighbor of node that has largest degrees out of the neighborhood of the original node .",
    "this is an efficient immunization strategy that uses only the local information about the network .",
    "the ring vaccination @xcite stands on a similar spirit .",
    "in contrast to these strategies , the mod strategy has an important limitation that one needs global information about the connectivity among modules . nevertheless , the mod and out strategies are complementary with regard to the information needed for implementation .",
    "the mod strategy requires coarse but global information about the network , plus the degree of each node .",
    "the out strategies require only the local information about the network , but with the information about the degree of the neighbors included .",
    "our results are consistent with the finding that nodes in a network can be classified according to their global and local roles @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true when the betweenness centrality is not predicted from the degree @xcite , which is typical for modular networks .",
    "the deviation of the global importance of a node from the local importance of the same node in modular networks is also reported for the pagerank and other similar centrality measures @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the mod strategy preferentially immunizes globally important nodes having important intermodular links rather than locally important ones such as local hubs .",
    "the general idea of targeting globally important nodes in modular networks has potential applications in other dynamical phenomena on networks , such as epidemic dynamics , synchronization , opinion formation , and traffic .",
