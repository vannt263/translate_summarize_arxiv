    "the study of the equation of state ( eos ) of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , especially the nuclear symmetry energy , is currently an active field of research in nuclear physics ireview98,ibook , bom , diep03,pawel02,lat04,baran05,steiner05 .",
    "although the nuclear symmetry energy at normal nuclear matter density is known to be around @xmath9 from the empirical liquid - drop mass formula @xcite , its values at other densities , especially at supranormal densities , are poorly known @xcite .",
    "advances in radioactive nuclear beam facilities provide , however , the possibility to pin down the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy in heavy ion collisions induced by these nuclei @xcite .",
    "indeed , significant progress has recently been made in extracting the information on the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy from the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion collisions at nscl / msu @xcite . using an isospin- and momentum - dependent ibuu04 transport model with in - medium nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) cross sections ,",
    "the isospin diffusion data were found to be consistent with a relatively soft nuclear symmetry energy at subnormal density @xcite .",
    "information on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy can also be obtained from the thickness of the neutron skin in heavy nuclei as the latter is strongly correlated with the slope @xmath2 of the nuclear matter symmetry energy at saturation density @xcite . because of the large uncertainties in measured neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei , this has not been possible .",
    "instead , studies have been carried out to use the extracted nuclear symmetry energy from the isospin diffusion data to constrain the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei @xcite . using the hartree - fock approximation with parameters fitted to the phenomenological eos that was used in the ibuu04 transport model to describe the isospin diffusion data from nscl / msu",
    ", it was found that a neutron skin thickness of less than @xmath10 fm @xcite for @xmath4pb was incompatible with the isospin diffusion data .    in the present talk ,",
    "we report our recent work on constraining the skyrme effective interactions and the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei using the isospin diffusion data from heavy ion collisions @xcite . using the value of @xmath2 obtained from the extracted density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy from the isospin diffusion data , we have been able to limit the allowed parameter sets for the skyrme interaction .",
    "also , studying the correlation between the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and the thickness of the neutron skin in a number of nuclei within the framework of the skyrme hartree - fock approach further allows us to obtain stringent constraints on the neutron skin thickness of the nuclei @xmath4pb , @xmath6sn , and @xmath8sn .",
    "the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath11 at nuclear density @xmath12 can be expanded around the nuclear matter saturation density @xmath13 as @xmath14where @xmath2 and @xmath15 are the slope and curvature of the nuclear symmetry energy at @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath16the @xmath2 and @xmath15 characterize the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy around normal nuclear matter density , and thus provide important information on the properties of nuclear symmetry energy at both high and low densities .    in the standard skyrme hartree - fock approach @xcite ,",
    "the interaction is taken to be zero - range and density- and momentum - dependent with its parameters fitted to the binding energies and charge radii of a large number of nuclei in the periodic table .",
    "for infinite nuclear matter , the nuclear symmetry energy from the skyrme interaction can be expressed as @xcite @xmath17\\rho ^{5/3 } , \\label{esymsky}\\end{aligned}\\]]where the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are skyrme interaction parameters .",
    "[ symden ] displays the density dependence of @xmath11 for @xmath21 sets of skyrme interaction parameters , i.e. , , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , , , @xmath24 , , , , , @xmath25 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . values of the parameters in these skyrme interactions can be found in refs .",
    "brack85,fried86,brown98 . for comparison",
    ", we also show in fig .",
    "[ symden ] results from the phenomenological parametrization of the momentum - dependent nuclear mean - field potential based on the gogny effective interaction das03 , i.e. , the mdi interactions with @xmath35 ( open squares ) and @xmath36 ( solid squares ) , where different @xmath37 values correspond to different density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy but keep other properties of the nuclear eos the same @xcite . by comparing the isospin diffusion data from nscl / msu with results from the ibuu04 transport model using in - medium nn cross sections ,",
    "these interactions have been shown to give , respectively , the upper and lower bounds for the stiffness of the nuclear symmetry energy li05 .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ symden ] that the density dependence of the symmetry energy varies drastically among different interactions .",
    "although the values of @xmath38 are all in the small range of @xmath39-@xmath40 mev , the values of @xmath2 and @xmath15 are in a much larger range of @xmath41-@xmath42 mev and @xmath43-@xmath44 mev , respectively .",
    "nuclear symmetry energy is known to affect the diffusion of isospin in intermediate - energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "experimentally , the degree of isospin diffusion between the projectile nucleus @xmath45 and the target nucleus @xmath46 can be studied via the quantity @xmath47 @xcite , @xmath48where @xmath49 is any isospin - sensitive observable . by construction , the value of @xmath50 is @xmath51 for symmetric @xmath52 reaction .",
    "if isospin equilibrium is reached during the collision as a result of isospin diffusion , the value of @xmath50 is about zero . in the nscl / msu experiments with @xmath53 @xmath8sn and @xmath54 @xmath55sn at a beam energy of @xmath44 mev / nucleon and an impact parameter about @xmath56 fm",
    ", the isospin asymmetry of the projectile - like residue was used as the isospin tracer @xmath49 @xcite . using an isospin- and momentum - dependent ibuu04 transport model with free - space experimental nn cross sections ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath50 on the nuclear symmetry energy was studied from the average isospin asymmetry of the projectile - like residue that was calculated from nucleons with local densities higher than @xmath57 and velocities larger than @xmath58 the beam velocity in the center - of - mass frame @xcite .",
    "comparing theoretical results with experimental data has allowed us to extract a nuclear symmetry energy of @xmath59 .",
    "including also medium - dependent nn cross sections , which are important for isospin - dependent observables @xcite , the isospin diffusion data leads to an even softer nuclear symmetry energy of @xmath60 with @xmath61 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ ril ] , we show the degree of the isospin diffusion @xmath62 as a function of @xmath2 obtained from the ibuu04 transport model with in - medium nn cross sections and the mean - field potential based on the mdi interactions .",
    "the shaded band in fig . [ ril ] indicates the data from nscl / msu @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the strength of isospin diffusion @xmath62 decreases monotonically with decreasing value of @xmath37 or increasing value of @xmath2 .",
    "this is expected as the parameter @xmath2 reflects the difference in the pressures on neutrons and protons . from comparison of the theoretical results with the data",
    ", we can clearly exclude the mdi interaction with @xmath63 and @xmath64 as they give either too large or too small a value for @xmath62 compared to that of data .",
    "the range of @xmath37 or @xmath2 values that give values of @xmath62 falling within the band of experimental values could in principle be determined in our model by detailed calculations .",
    "instead , we determine this schematically by using the results from the four @xmath37 values . for the centroid value of @xmath2 , it is obtained from the interception of the line connecting the theoretical results at @xmath35 and @xmath36 with the central value of @xmath62 data in fig .",
    "[ ril ] , i.e. , @xmath65 mev .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath66 mev is estimated from the interception of the line connecting the upper error bars of the theoretical results at @xmath35 and @xmath67 with the lower limit of the data band of @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , the lower limit of @xmath68 mev is estimated from the interception of the line connecting the lower error bars of the theoretical results at @xmath69 and @xmath70 with the upper limit of the data band of @xmath62 .",
    "this leads to an extracted value of @xmath71 mev as shown by the solid square with error bar in fig .",
    "[ ril ] .",
    "the extracted value of @xmath0 mev gives a rather stringent constraint on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and thus puts strong limitations on the nuclear effective interactions as well . for the skyrme effective interactions shown in fig .",
    "[ symden ] , for instance , all of those lie beyond @xmath69 and @xmath35 in the sub - saturation region are not consistent with the extracted value of @xmath2 .",
    "actually , we note that only @xmath72 sets of skyrme interactions , i.e. , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath26 , in the @xmath21 sets of skyrme interactions considered here have nuclear symmetry energies that are consistent with the extracted @xmath2 value .",
    "also affected by the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy is the neutron skin thickness @xmath76 of a nucleus , which is defined as the difference between the root - mean - square radii @xmath77 of neutrons and @xmath78 of protons , i.e. , @xmath79 in particular , @xmath76 is sensitive to the slope parameter @xmath2 of the nuclear symmetry energy at normal nuclear matter density @xcite . using above @xmath21 sets of skyrme interaction parameters ,",
    "we have evaluated the neutron skin thickness of several nuclei . in figs .",
    "[ spb208](a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , we show , respectively , the correlations between the neutron skin thickness of @xmath4pb with @xmath2 , @xmath15 , and @xmath38 .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ spb208](a ) that there exists an approximate linear correlation between @xmath76 and @xmath2 .",
    "the correlations of @xmath76 with @xmath15 and @xmath38 are less strong and even exhibit some irregular behavior . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ spb208](a ) is a linear fit to the correlation between @xmath76 and @xmath2 and is given by the following expression : @xmath80or @xmath81where the units of @xmath2 and @xmath76 are and , respectively .",
    "therefore , if the value for either @xmath82pb ) or @xmath2 is known , the value for the other can be determined .",
    "it is of interest to see if there are also correlations between the neutron skin thickness of other neutron - rich nuclei and the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "[ ssnca ] shows the same correlations as in fig .",
    "[ spb208 ] but for the neutron - rich nuclei @xmath6sn , @xmath8sn , and @xmath83ca .",
    "for the heavier @xmath6sn and @xmath8sn , we obtain a similar conclusion as for @xmath4pb , namely , @xmath76 exhibits an approximate linear correlation with @xmath2 but weaker correlations with @xmath15 and @xmath38 . for the lighter @xmath83ca ,",
    "on the other hand , all the correlations become weaker than those of heavier nuclei .",
    "the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei is thus better correlated with the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy . as in eq .",
    "( [ slpb208a ] ) and ( [ slpb208b ] ) , a linear fit to the correlation between @xmath76 and @xmath2 can also be obtained for @xmath6sn and @xmath8sn , and the corresponding expressions are @xmath84@xmath85and @xmath86@xmath87    similar linear relations between @xmath76 and @xmath2 are also expected for other heavy nuclei .",
    "this is not surprising as detailed discussions in refs . brown00,hor01,typel01,furn02,kara02,diep03",
    "have shown that the thickness of the neutron skin in heavy nuclei is determined by the pressure difference between neutrons and protons , which is proportional to the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the extracted @xmath2 value from the isospin diffusion data in heavy ion collisions allows us to determine from eqs .",
    "( [ slpb208a ] ) , ( [ slsn132a ] ) , and ( [ slsn124a ] ) , respectively , a neutron skin thickness of @xmath3 fm for @xmath4pb , @xmath5 fm for @xmath6sn , and @xmath3 fm for @xmath8sn . experimentally , great efforts were devoted to measure the thickness of the neutron skin in heavy nuclei sta94,clark03 , and a recent review can be found in ref .",
    "the data for the neutron skin thickness of @xmath4pb indicate a large uncertainty , i.e. , @xmath95-@xmath96 fm . our results for the neutron skin thickness of @xmath4pb",
    "are thus consistent with present data but give a much stronger constraint .",
    "a large uncertainty is also found experimentally in the neutron skin thickness of @xmath8sn , i.e. , its value varies from @xmath97 fm to @xmath98 fm depending on the experimental method .",
    "the proposed experiment of parity - violating electron scattering from @xmath4pb at the jefferson laboratory is expected to give another independent and more accurate measurement of its neutron skin thickness ( within @xmath99 fm ) , thus providing improved constraints on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "most recently , an accurately calibrated relativistic parametrization based on the relativistic mean - field theory has been introduced to study the neutron skin thickness of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "this parametrization can describe simultaneously the ground state properties of finite nuclei and their monopole and dipole resonances . using this parametrization ,",
    "the authors predicted a neutron skin thickness of @xmath100 fm in @xmath4pb , @xmath101 fm in @xmath6sn , and @xmath102 fm in @xmath8 sn @xcite .",
    "these predictions are in surprisingly good agreement with our results constrained by the isospin diffusion data from heavy - ion collisions .",
    "both the structure of nuclear surface and the dynamics of isospin equilibration in heavy ion collisions are affected by the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy . from the most recent analysis of the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion collisions using an isospin- and momentum - dependent transport model with in - medium nn cross sections ,",
    "a value @xmath0 mev has been extracted for the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density .",
    "this relatively constrained value imposes strong constraints on the parameters in the skyrme effective interactions . among the 21 sets of commonly used skyrme parameters , only siv , sv , g@xmath1 , and r@xmath1 have @xmath2 values that are consistent with the extracted one .",
    "we have also studied the correlation between the neutron skin thickness of finite nuclei and the nuclear symmetry energy within the framework of the skyrme hartree - fock model . as in previous studies ,",
    "we have found a strong linear correlation between the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei and the slope @xmath2 of the nuclear matter symmetry energy at saturation density .",
    "this correlation provides stringent constraints on both the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and the thickness of the neutron skin in heavy nuclei .",
    "the extracted @xmath2 value from the isospin diffusion data then leads to predicted neutron skin thickness of @xmath3 fm for @xmath4pb , @xmath103 fm for @xmath6sn , and @xmath3 fm for @xmath8sn .",
