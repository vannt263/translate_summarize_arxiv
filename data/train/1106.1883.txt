    "combinatorial game theory is concerned with sequential - play games with perfect information .",
    "a class of games of fundamental interest are the _ impartial games _ , the games with an acyclic directed graph of _ positions _ , in which two players alternate moving from the current position to one of its _ options _ ,",
    "i.e.  its neighbours along out - edges",
    ". we will insist that the graph be locally finite in the sense that there are only finitely many positions reachable by sequences of moves from each given position .",
    "we are interested in ascertaining the _ outcome _ of each position , that is , who will win with perfect play , the player who is next to move or the other player .",
    "we call a position an _ @xmath0-position _ ( for * n*ext player win ) in the former case , and a _ @xmath1-position _",
    "( for * p*revious player win ) in the latter .",
    "the first theorem that can be said to belong to combinatorial game theory generally , as opposed to some particular game , is the sprague - grundy theorem  @xcite .",
    "it asserts that , under the _ normal play _ convention in which a player with no available move loses , every position in an impartial game is equivalent to a position in one - heap nim .",
    "the positions of one - heap nim are @xmath2 , and the options of  @xmath3 are @xmath4 .",
    "the notion of equivalence invoked here is the following . the _ disjunctive sum _ @xmath5 of two combinatorial games @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath7 is the game whose graph of positions is the cartesian product of these graphs for @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; that is to say , a position of the sum consists of a position of @xmath6 and a position of @xmath7 , and a move in the sum consists of choosing one of @xmath6 and @xmath7 and moving in it .",
    "two impartial games @xmath6 and @xmath8 are then _ equivalent _ if @xmath5 and @xmath9 have the same outcome for every impartial game @xmath7 .    in order for this theory , or any other , to be of practical use for a given game",
    ", it should provide a computationally efficient way to compute outcomes of positions .",
    "one family for which the sprague - grundy theory achieves this are the _ octal games _",
    "@xcite , including several games which have historically been of interest . in the recent paper  @xcite , guo and miller",
    "propose the class of _ lattice games _ as an extension of the octal games , looking to use the theory of lattice points in polyhedra , especially its algorithmic aspects , to obtain computational efficiency .",
    "the positions of a lattice game are an ideal @xmath10 with finite complement in a pointed affine semigroup @xmath11 .",
    "the elements @xmath12 are called the _ defeated positions _ , though they are not positions as we use the term .",
    "the other datum of a lattice game is its _ ruleset _ , a set @xmath13 of vectors in @xmath14 .",
    "see  @xcite for the precise axioms that are required of  @xmath13 . a position @xmath15 is an option of a position @xmath16 if and only if @xmath17 ; that is , a move in a lattice game consists of subtracting a vector in @xmath13 from a position .",
    "( it has been allowed that @xmath10 not equal @xmath11 in order to subsume also the _ misre play _ convention , in which a player with no moves wins rather than losing .",
    "misre play has proved much less tractable than the normal play to analyze . however , weakening the notion of equivalence to restrict @xmath7 to positions of the game in question leads to the _ misre quotient _ theory of plambeck and siegel  @xcite , which has made advances in many particular cases . )",
    "the structure on which are hung the algorithmic results of @xcite and its followup @xcite is the notion of _ affine stratification_. a lattice game has an affine stratification if its set @xmath18 of @xmath1-positions is a finite disjoint union of modules for affine semigroups of @xmath11 . in the language of discrete geometry ,",
    "this is true if and only if @xmath18 is a finite disjoint union of intersections of rational polyhedra with sublattices of @xmath14 .",
    "guo and miller also invoke the related notion of a _ rational strategy _ : a game has a rational strategy if its set @xmath18 has rational multigraded generating function .",
    "having an affine stratification is at least as strong as having a rational strategy , by standard facts in polyhedral geometry : see for instance @xcite .",
    "but in fact the two conditions are equivalent @xcite .",
    "guo and miller conjectured that every lattice game possesses a rational strategy .",
    "the purpose of this note is to provide counterexamples to that conjecture .",
    "[ thm:1 ] there exist lattice games , with normal play on the board @xmath19 , with no rational strategy .",
    "an explicit example of a game with no rational strategy , with rule set of size 28 , is constructed in example  [ ex : xor realised ] .    in terms of the goals of  @xcite",
    ", the import of theorem  [ thm:1 ] is that lattice games are too broad a class of games for efficient computation of strategies to be possible ; that is to say , lattice games themselves retain too much computational power .",
    "it seems possible that the lattice game perspective may only prove fruitful in this regard for the _ squarefree lattice games _ of @xcite , which already contain the octal games , and which are proved in that work to have rational strategies in normal play .",
    "it is perhaps unsurprising that squarefree lattice games should be amenable to this approach , in view of the sprague - grundy theorem and the fact that it is exactly in the squarefree lattice games that for two positions @xmath20 , the position @xmath21 that is their sum in the semigroup @xmath11 is also their disjunctive sum . needless to say ,",
    "the lattice games we construct are not squarefree .",
    "the construction that underlies theorem  [ thm:1 ] works by arranging that the outcomes of a certain subset of the board should compute a given recursively - defined function @xmath22 on a rank 2 affine semigroup , i.e.  a function to a set @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 for some @xmath25 .",
    "( see section  [ sec : construction ] for a more careful statement . ) among the functions of this form are the functions recording the states of the cells of 1-dimensional cellular automata ; therefore , lattice games can realize any phenomenon that 1-dimensional cellular automata can .",
    "in particular , since cellular automata are known to be capable of universal computation ( see @xcite and several subsequent works ) , the same is true of lattice games .",
    "[ thm : universal ] the class of lattice games in @xmath19 is capable of universal computation",
    ".    we will describe variants of our construction allowing the input to the cellular automaton to be provided in either of the following ways :    1 .",
    "one ruleset which is computationally universal , with the input to the universal function encoded in the defeated positions ; 2 .   a family of rulesets which themselves encode the input , in normal play ( i.e.  with no defeated positions ) .    in both cases",
    "the output of the computation is given by the outcomes of certain positions .",
    "in particular we get the following corollary .    1 .",
    "there exists a ruleset for a lattice game on @xmath19 such that , given a set of defeated positions @xmath26 and and integers @xmath27 , it is undecidable whether there exist @xmath28 such that @xmath29 is a @xmath1-position .",
    "2 .   given a ruleset for a lattice game on @xmath30 with no defeated positions , and integers @xmath27 , it is undecidable whether there exist @xmath28 such that @xmath29 is a @xmath1-position .      for sets",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the minkowski sum , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "this last is not the set difference , which is written @xmath36 .    for lattice games , we follow the notation and definitions of  @xcite .",
    "we will supplement this by speaking of the outcome function @xmath37 from the positions @xmath38 of a lattice game to the set of two symbols @xmath39 ; this is defined by @xmath40 if @xmath15 is a @xmath1-position , and @xmath41 if @xmath15 is an @xmath0-position .",
    "( in  @xcite , the authors mostly speak of bipartitions ; they would write @xmath42 and @xmath43 to express these . )",
    "in this section , the remainder of the paper , we provide a construction proving theorems [ thm:1 ] and  [ thm : universal ] , and close with a concrete example of a lattice game without a rational strategy .",
    "in fact , we will describe three closely related variants of the construction at once .",
    "two of them , variants  a and  b , correspond to the two ways of providing the input of a computation mentioned just after theorem  [ thm : universal ] .",
    "the third , call it variant  c for completeness , will correspond to using neither of these and not providing for any sort of input .",
    "we first set up the recursively defined function @xmath22 which we will be arranging for the outcomes of our game to compute .",
    "let @xmath44 be a sublattice of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and let @xmath47 be an ideal in @xmath48 with finite complement .",
    "let @xmath49 be nonzero vectors in the same halfspace , which themselves satisfy the tangent cone axiom for  @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath23 be a finite set .",
    "let @xmath51 be a map of sets , and define @xmath52 as follows .",
    "if @xmath53 is a minimal @xmath48-module generator of @xmath47 , we may let @xmath54 take any value @xmath55 .",

    "if @xmath56 is not a generator , then we let @xmath57 for some fixed @xmath58 .    in outline , our construction will produce a periodic circuit of nor gates computing @xmath22 , and realize this on a union of dilates of @xmath47 inside the slice @xmath59 of the board @xmath19 .",
    "some of the moves in the ruleset will correspond to the wires in the circuit . at the heart of this",
    "is the fact that , if we identify @xmath1 with true and @xmath0 with false , then nor is the function that computes the outcome of a position from the outcomes of its options . the rest of the moves in the ruleset force the outcomes on @xmath60 to have the same period as the circuit construction , and the outcomes on @xmath59 minus the circuit to all be @xmath0 so as not to interfere with the circuit .",

    "thus , if @xmath257 is defined such that the outcome of @xmath255 is @xmath258 for all  @xmath239 , then @xmath259 satisfies ,    by the inductive hypothesis , the outcome of @xmath260 is @xmath261 , if @xmath262 . as noted above",
    ", the outcome of @xmath244 is @xmath1 if and only if some @xmath245 .",
    "thus @xmath257 also satisfies , and @xmath263 iff some @xmath245 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath259 must compute the function in . comparing to",
    ", we have completed the proof .",
    "[ ex : xor realised ] we present a lattice game without a rational strategy .",
    "this example deviates from the construction described above in some particulars , though the fundamental operation of the construction is the same .",
    "this is in the interest of minimality : our last ruleset @xmath264 is the result of some earnest effort to minimize its size .    of note among the deviations",
    "is that , instead of using a vertex @xmath96 and the vectors in to detect the initial conditions of the recurrence , we choose the positions of the gates so that @xmath93 itself plays the analogous role .",
    "in addition , we use variant  c , since we do not use the parts of the construction meant to allow for arbitrary input to computations .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath271 exactly if @xmath272 is odd , and in particular therefore that , for any natural @xmath3 , we have @xmath273 if @xmath274 or @xmath275 , but @xmath276 if @xmath277 while @xmath278 .",
    "therefore , this game has no affine stratification .",
    "if it had one , this would induce an affine stratification on the subset @xmath59 .",
    "in particular there would be some 2-dimensional cone @xmath279 such that the outcome function @xmath280 , @xmath281 factored through @xmath282 for some rank 2 lattice @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath174 meets the interior of either @xmath283 or @xmath284 , without loss of generality @xmath285 ; by intersecting it with @xmath285 , we can assume @xmath286 .",
    "let @xmath209 with @xmath287 .",
    "then , for large enough @xmath3 , there must exist a point @xmath288 such that @xmath289 , and @xmath290 .",
    "then @xmath223 is a @xmath1-position and @xmath291 is an @xmath0-position , contradiction .",
    "it is a routine check that this satisfies conditions ( a ) through  ( f ) and ( i ) .",
    "observe that @xmath295 mod @xmath115 , so that positions of @xmath59 corresponding to one of @xmath296 and @xmath297 will generally correspond to both in different translates ; this is not problematic .",
    "we must argue that our construction makes @xmath298 equal to @xmath299 when @xmath300 or @xmath301 , since our proof relied on the vertex @xmath96 for that .",
    "our proof still implies that @xmath302 exactly when there is no edge @xmath303 such that @xmath304 .",
    "but , if @xmath300 or @xmath301 , then @xmath305 is not in @xmath50 for any @xmath77 .",
    "therefore @xmath302 as desired .        , drawn in the two slices @xmath308 , @xmath309 .",
