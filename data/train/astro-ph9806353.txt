    "the relation between temperature @xmath13 and luminosity @xmath15 is a sensitive diagnostic of structural regularity in clusters of galaxies . because the luminosity is governed by the mass of gas in the intracluster medium ( icm ) while the temperature is determined by the total , gravitating cluster mass , the @xmath14 relation can be used as a tool to probe variations in gas fraction  the ratio of icm gas to total mass  in these systems .",
    "evidence for a correlation between these basic observational quantities has existed since the early days of astronomy ( mitchell 1977 , 1979 ; mushotzky 1978 ; edge & stewart 1991 , david 1993 ) . despite its relative maturity , a key characteristic of this relation was only recently established .",
    "fabian ( 1994 ) demonstrate that the departure of a cluster from the mean @xmath16 relation is correlated with the strength of the emission associated with its cooling flow core .",
    "the picture resulting from this work is of a mixed population which is likely to be time variable .",
    "fabian speculate that cooling flows are a recurrent phenomenon associated with a secular instability in the icm plasma which periodically is interrupted and reset by strong merging encounters .",
    "periodic mergers of varying strength are a natural feature of hierarchical clustering models of structure formation , and numerical simulations suggest that cooling flow features can be erased by mergers ( garasi , burns & loken 1997 ) .",
    "however , the theoretical picture remains incomplete because of the complexities of the physics operating in the cluster core .",
    "regardless of the exact physical mechanisms responsible , the empirical fact is that the cluster population can be broadly classed into two categories by making a cut in cooling flow strength @xmath17 .    in this paper , we present and analyze the luminosity  temperature relation from a nearly homogeneous data set of weak cooling flow clusters , where @xmath18 defines weak .",
    "the data set is described in  2 , with particular attention paid to systematic errors in determination of both @xmath15 and @xmath13 . in  3 , we present the @xmath14 relation and show that these data place stringent limits on gas fraction variations within this sub  population .",
    "imaging data taken from the literature allow us to estimate absolute values of the gas fraction at fixed density contrast in  4 .",
    "we compare results for two different binding mass estimation methods , and emphasize the systematic uncertainty introduced by this choice .",
    "hubble constant dependencies are displayed in the paper via @xmath19 and we assume @xmath20 when quoting numerical values throughout the paper .",
    "we analyse an archival data set , part of which was assembled and discussed by arnaud ( 1994 ) .",
    "a prime objective is to limit both statistical and systematic errors in @xmath21 and @xmath13 , in order to obtain an accurate assessment of the intrinsic dispersion about the mean @xmath16 relation .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the trend of rising gas fraction with increasing radius ( lower @xmath22 ) is apparent with both mass estimation methods , and reflects the more extended nature of the gas density compared to the assumed or inferred dark matter profiles .",
    "gas fraction values are consistently higher in the bm approach , due to the smaller , inferred total masses noted above . as a result , significantly different sample means can be quoted depending on the mass method and extent of radial coverage of the dataset .",
    "compare , for example , @xmath23 for the vt at @xmath9 with @xmath24 for the bm at @xmath25 .",
    "the range becomes wider when one considers subsets of the data defined by temperature .",
    "all the panels in figure  ( [ fbarplot ] ) display a trend of decreasing gas fraction at lower @xmath13 , but only the vt method at @xmath9 is deemed statistically significantly ( @xmath26 ) under our @xmath27 error hypothesis . due to the robustness of the bi ",
    "weight mean estimator , this conclusion is valid with or without the inclusion of the principal outlier a1060 .",
    "it is perhaps also worth noting that the discrepancy between a1060 and the mean of the cool subsample is smaller under the vt approach .",
    "the value of @xmath28 for the hot subsample in the vt case is consistent with the @xmath29 confidence region @xmath30 ( @xmath20 ) determined by evrard ( 1997 ) from the combined samples of white & fabian ( 1995 ) and david , jones & forman ( 1995 ) .",
    "only 3 of the 26 clusters in the combined study have @xmath8 ( and these have fairly uncertain gas fractions which make negligible contribution to the sample mean ) , so comparison with our high@xmath13 subsample is reasonable .",
    "the agreement between these two studies is not entirely trivial . although there is nearly @xmath31 overlap with our subsample",
    " 6 of our 14 are in common with white & fabian  we employ here different temperature estimates in many cases ( though all are consistent within the quoted errors ) and we normalize the gas mass differently .",
    "a less obvious trend in the data is the larger variance in gas fractions in the bm case compared to the vt .",
    "this is more apparent in the @xmath13dependent subsamples , since the trend of mean gas fraction with temperature mimics variance in the full vt sample .",
    "the lower scatter in the vt method confirms theoretical predictions that the @xmath5 parameter acts as an extra source of noise in the bm mass estimates ( emn ) .",
    "an increase in scatter is also seen at larger radii / lower densities , consistent with the numerical model predictions and interpreted simply as reflecting the longer relaxation timescales in the outer regions of clusters .",
    "there is strong evidence from the slope of the @xmath14 relation and from the behavior of the image fall - off parameter @xmath5 that cluster structure varies systematically with temperature .",
    "whether the virial gas fraction varies with cluster temperature is a question whose answer is both model and scale dependent .",
    "the model dependency we highlight is the choice of total mass estimation method , while the chosen density contrast sets the scale .",
    "for example , the applied at @xmath32 produces similar mean values in high and low temperature subsamples  @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively  whereas the virial theorem at @xmath35 yields significantly different values in these subsamples  @xmath36 against @xmath37 , respectively ( see table  2 and figure  [ fbarplot ] , all values scale as @xmath38 ) .",
    "that the implications of the observed luminosity  temperature relation are model dependent can be seen by considering the behavior of terms with temperature dependence contained in the defining relation , equation  ( [ lxmod2 ] ) .",
    "the structure factor @xmath39 appears to increase with temperature , but this effect is not solely responsible for the steepening of the @xmath14 relation .",
    "the dependence with @xmath13 of the other factors depends on the total mass estimation method . in the vt approach , while @xmath40 scales classically as @xmath41 , @xmath42 increases with @xmath13 . in the bm case , while @xmath43 is found to be nearly constant , the slope of the @xmath44 relation is steeper than @xmath45 , due to the extra @xmath5 factor and its increase with @xmath13 ( equation  ( [ massrat ] ) ) .",
    "both cases result in a steepening of the @xmath46 term to a slope greater than the canonical @xmath45 .",
    "the temperature dependence of this term contributes about equally with @xmath39 to the steepening of the @xmath14 relation .",
    "allan & fabian ( 1998 ) take a different approach in analysis of a cluster dataset combining asca spectroscopy with rosat imaging .",
    "they fit asca data to a multi - component spectral model which includes emission from a central cooling flow ( johnstone 1992 ) , absorption from galactic hydrogen , intrinsic hydrogen absorption , and a superimposed background plasma at temperature @xmath13 . compared to simpler fits without cooling flow and intrinsic absorption ,",
    "the best fit temperatures in their complex fits are higher , and the best fit slope of the @xmath14 relation is shallower , @xmath47 .",
    "allen & fabian emphasize that this slope is consistent with the straightforward theoretical expectation of @xmath48 ; however , note that the range of slopes allowed in our fit does overlap the error range quoted above ( derived from a change @xmath49 in their @xmath50 analysis ) .",
    "the approximate nature of our error analysis limits the conclusions which can be drawn regarding gas fraction variations .",
    "a definitive analysis awaits uniform treatment of a large , homogeneous dataset .",
    "there is some supporting evidence for deficient gas fractions in poor groups ( hickson , 1997 and references therein ) , but there also appears to be larger scatter at low temperatures ( , ponman 1996 ) and observational uncertainties on the icm mass remain large in these systems .",
    "in particular the separation of the icm emission from the x  ray emission linked to individual galaxies is ambiguous and difficult with present instruments ( mahdavi 1997 , mulchey and zabludoff 1998 ) .",
    "the narrow scatter in the @xmath14 relation of weak cooling flow clusters ( @xmath51 ) indicates that the structure of the intracluster medium in this majority sub  class is very regular . under a conservative assumption of no correlation between virial gas fraction and internal , structural variations ( @xmath52 )",
    ", we place upper limits on the _ rms _ percentage variation in virial gas fraction of @xmath53 for the entire sample of 24 clusters , and @xmath2 for the homogeneous ginga subset of 18 clusters .",
    "these limits are conservative because the imaging data supports the point of view that gas in low @xmath13 clusters is more extended than that of high @xmath13 clusters ( figure  [ betaplot ] ) .",
    "mohr & evrard ( 1997 ) find the same result with a non  parametric analysis of images .",
    "they also derive limits on gas fraction variations similar to those found here based on the tightness of the size  temperature ( st ) relation .",
    "the agreement is non  trivial because the st analysis is essentially _ local _ , being based on an differential isophotal area , while the @xmath14 relation analysis is _ global _ , based an the integrated emission of the entire cluster atmosphere .",
    "both analyses are consistent with idea that energy input from galactic winds has led to extended gas atmospheres in low @xmath13 clusters ( david , forman & jones 1990,1991 ; white 1991 ; metzler & evrard 1997 ; cavaliere 1997 ; ponman 1996 ) .    in wind models ,",
    "gas loss is correlated with structural extension of the gas , leading to @xmath54 . the inferred variance in gas fraction derived from equation  ( [ delta_f2 ] ) could be substantially smaller than the limits phrased above if winds have played an important evolutionary role .",
    "numerical simulations of clusters used by mohr & evrard ( 1997 ) exhibit less than 5% fractional variation in their virial gas fractions , and a similar value is seen in models with galactic winds ( metzler & evrard 1997 ) . the expected `` cosmic variance '' in virial gas fractions is thus quite small .",
    "comparison of a number of different simulation techniques paints a similar picture .",
    "frenk ( 1998 ) find agreement at the 5% level ( @xmath55 deviation ) for the virial gas fraction of a single cluster determined by twelve independent gas dynamic methods .",
    "this indicates that systematic uncertainties in the tested numerical simulation techniques are small for the simplest case of a single phase icm .",
    "however , it is important to note that the quoted simulations ignore galaxy formation and its attendant multi ",
    "phase , gas structure . introducing galaxy formation via cooling and",
    "star formation is likely to increase the scatter in icm gas fraction values , and it will be interesting to see whether viable models can do so without violating the observational limits presented here .",
    "evidence for trends in @xmath56 with cluster temperature is ambiguous .",
    "a key uncertainty lies in estimation of the total , binding mass .",
    "the approach produces masses which are characteristically smaller than the virial theorem method as currently calibrated by numerical simulations . for a cluster with @xmath57 ,",
    "the masses inferred at @xmath4 differ substantially , @xmath58 .",
    "this different behavior , coupled with the temperature dependence of @xmath5 , leads to differing conclusions on whether the mean gas fraction varies with cluster temperature .",
    "for the same reason there is some ambiguity in the origin of the steepening of the @xmath14 relation .",
    "the fact that the gas is more concentrated in high - kt cluster explains at least half of the effect , directly through the structure factor in the x  ray luminosity . in the approach ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the icm structure can fully account for the @xmath14 relation slope , via the additional dependence of the total mass with @xmath5 . on the other hand , in the vt approach",
    ", the gas mass fraction increases with @xmath13 and this effect contributes about equally to the @xmath14 relation slope increase .",
    "both effects , lower gas fraction and inflated gas distribution in low t systems , are expected in models incorporating the effects of galactic winds .",
    "independent methods for estimating virial masses are crucial , and weak gravitational lensing provides an important approach .",
    "allen ( 1997 ) provides evidence that weak lensing and mass estimates are consistent , but the present errors at radii between @xmath59 or @xmath60 are too large to discriminate between the bm and vt approaches .",
    "we suggest that weak lensing analysis of a small sample of moderate redshift clusters selected to have @xmath61 from imaging could settle the score , if individual measurement uncertainties could be kept below a few tens of percent at @xmath62 .",
    "future missions which provide simultaneous imaging and spectroscopic capability ( axaf , xmm , astro - e ) will provide improvements over the current dataset",
    ". the ideal analysis would be one of a flux limited sample with central , cooling flow regions excised ( markevitch 1998 ) , using a nearly homogeneous dataset of temperatures , luminosities and surface brightness maps derived from the same telescope .",
    "such data would minimize variance caused by instrumental uncertainties and open the door to very high precision measurements of intracluster gas fractions .",
    "finally , small scatter in virial gas fractions lends support to arguments against an einstein  desitter universe based on cluster baryon fractions and primordial nucleosynthesis ( white 1993 ; evrard 1997 ) . the standard counterargument to this idea",
    "has been that the physics of the icm is more complicated than is assumed in most analytic or numerical models",
    ". however , if additional physics beyond gravity , shock heating and galactic wind input is at work in cluster icm atmospheres , then the extra processes involved must conspire to keep the scatter in the observed @xmath14 and st relations small . since @xmath15 and @xmath63 ( the `` size '' in the st relation ) are manifestly different measures ( global _ vs. _ local ) , it is not obvious that interesting physical mechanisms , such as a strongly multi  phase icm ( gunn & thomas 1996 ) , can be added in such a way as to preserve the current agreement between observations and current models incorporating the effects of galactic winds on the icm .",
