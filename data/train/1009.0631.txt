    "the combined maxima-1 @xcite , boomerang @xcite , dasi @xcite and cobe / dmr cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations @xcite imply that the universe is flat @xcite and that most of the matter in the universe is dark @xcite , i.e. exotic .",
    "these results have been confirmed and improved by the recent wmap data @xcite . combining the the data of these quite precise experiments one finds : @xmath0 since any `` invisible '' non exotic component can not possibly exceed @xmath1 of the above @xmath2  @xcite , exotic ( non baryonic ) matter is required and there is room for cold dark matter candidates or wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) .    since the wimp s",
    "are expected to be very massive and extremely non relativistic , they are not likely to excite the nucleus .",
    "so they can be directly detected mainly via the recoiling of a nucleus ( a , z ) in elastic scattering . in the standard nuclear recoil experiments ,",
    "first proposed more than 30 years ago @xcite , one has to face the problem that the reaction of interest does not have a characteristic feature to distinguish it from the background .",
    "so for the expected low counting rates the background is a formidable problem . some special features of the wimp - nuclear interaction can be exploited to reduce the background problems .",
    "such are : i ) the modulation effect : this yields a periodic signal due to the motion of the earth around the sun .",
    "ii ) backward - forward asymmetry expected in directional experiments , i.e. experiments in which the direction of the recoiling nucleus is also observed .",
    "iii ) transitions to very low excited states , if present in the target : in this case one need not measure nuclear recoils , but the de - excitation @xmath3 rays .",
    "( iv ) detection of electrons produced during the wimp - nucleus collision or subsequent x - rays .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite we have found that the observed directional rate is characterized by a strong dependence on the angle between the direction of nuclear recoil and the direction of the sun s motion , with respect to the center of the galaxy .",
    "the apparatus will , of course , be oriented in a direction defined in the local frame , i.e. the line of observation will point to a point in the sky specified , in the equatorial system , by right ascension @xmath4 and inclination @xmath5 . thus due to the rotation of the earth in a directional experiment the angle between the direction of observation and",
    "the sun s direction of motion will change during the day .",
    "so , since the event rates sensitively depend on this angle , as we have recently suggested  @xcite one may be able to observe a diurnal variation . in the present paper",
    "we will explore this novel feature of directional experiments , i.e. the variation of the data with a period of 24 hours .",
    "this variation is independent of the earth s rotational velocity .",
    "its amplitude depends , in addition to some of the usual parameters specifying the standard wimp event rate , on the inclination of observation , i.e. the angle between the direction of observation and the axis of the earth s rotation .",
    "those features can not be masked by any known background .",
    "the event rate for a given wimp velocity @xmath6 is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of nuclei in a target of mass @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the mass number of the target , @xmath11 is the energy transfer in some convenient units , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 with @xmath14 the nuclear form factor",
    ". we must now fold @xmath15 with the velocity distribution @xmath16 in the local frame . here",
    "we use @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the sun s velocity with respect to the center of the galaxy , and @xmath19 is the cosine of the the wimp velocity with the polar axis ( chosen to be the sun s direction of motion )",
    ". we will assume in this work that the velocity distribution is maxwell - boltzmann in the galactic frame , namely @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the wimp velocity in the galactic frame . obviously to obtain the distribution in the local frame one must take into account the motion of the sun and earth : @xmath22 where @xmath23 with @xmath24 the velocity of the earth around the sun , @xmath25 the phase of the earth ( @xmath25=0 on june 3rd ) and @xmath26 .",
    "in the case where @xmath27 , we get for the differential ( with respect to the energy transfer ) rate @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 we note that the function @xmath31 , a decreasing function of the energy transfer , depends only on the velocity distribution and is independent of nuclear physics .",
    "an additional suppression as the energy transfer increases comes , of course , from the nuclear form factor @xmath32 .",
    "note that the nuclear dependence of the differential rate comes mainly from the form factor and , to some extent , via the parameter @xmath33 . integrating the differential event rate from @xmath34 , which depends on the energy threshold , to @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 since @xmath37 ) we obtain the total rate @xmath38    in the case where @xmath39 we proceed as above and finally get for the differential rate an expression similar to ( [ dr-1 ] ) where now one has to replace : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is obtained as the linear term in an expansion of the velocity distribution in powers od @xmath42 .",
    "thus one has to replace :    @xmath43    @xmath44    thus we finally get @xmath45     , entering in the coherent mode discussed in this work , is shown as a function of the wimp mass in gev for @xmath46 for a light system , @xmath47s ( left ) and @xmath48i or @xmath49xe ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ] , entering in the coherent mode discussed in this work , is shown as a function of the wimp mass in gev for @xmath46 for a light system , @xmath47s ( left ) and @xmath48i or @xmath49xe ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]   +   @xmath50 gev      @xmath51=@xmath52pb for @xmath46 for a light system , @xmath47s ( left ) and a heavy system , @xmath49xe ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]   @xmath51=@xmath52pb for @xmath46 for a light system , @xmath47s ( left ) and a heavy system , @xmath49xe ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]   +   @xmath50 gev",
    "in this instance the experiments will attempt to measure not only the energy , but the direction of the recoiling nucleus as well @xcite .",
    "let us indicate the direction of observation by : @xmath53 now eq .",
    "( [ eq : dtdu ] ) must be motified since no integration over the azimuthal angle specifying the direction of the outgoing nucleus is performed .",
    "thus eqs .",
    "( [ eq : drdu ] ) and ( [ eq : dtdu ] ) now become @xmath54 @xmath55 the factor @xmath56 enters since we are going to make use of the same nuclear cross section as in the non directional case .",
    "the total event rate is obtained after folding with the velocity distribution and integrating the above expression over the energy transfer .",
    "it can be cast in the form : @xmath57 we found it convenient to use a new relative parameter @xmath58 maybe of experimental interest . ] as well as the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 given by : @xmath61    these parameters depend , of course , on the reduced mass @xmath62 , the wimp velocity distribution and , to some extent , on the nuclear physics via the nuclear form factor .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 gives the retardation factor of the directional rate , over and above the factor of @xmath63 , compared to the standard rate .",
    "since , however , the unmodulated amplitude is independent of @xmath64 one can integrate over @xmath64 so that the suppression of @xmath63 drops out for this term . because of the existence of both @xmath65 and @xmath66 terms the time dependence will be of the form @xmath67 , with the phase @xmath68 being direction dependent .",
    "thus the time of the maximum and minimum will depend on the direction .",
    "in other words the seasonal dependence will depend on the direction of observation .",
    "so it can not be masked by irrelevant seasonal effects .    before concluding this section we like to consider the case connected with the partly directional experiments , i.e. experiments which can determine the line along which the nucleus is recoiling , but not the sense of direction on it .",
    "the results in this case can be obtained by summing up the events in both directions .",
    "i.e. those specified by @xmath69 as well as @xmath70",
    ". a given line of observation is now specified by @xmath71 , @xmath64 in the range : @xmath72    the parameter @xmath73 entering the non directional case is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : totalh ] . using the above parameters @xmath74 and employing eq .",
    "( [ eq : totalr ] ) we obtain the time independent total event rate .",
    "the obtained results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : totalr ] .",
    "the total modulation , since it is defined relative to the time independent part , is still given by fig .",
    "[ fig : totalh ] .    , between the line of observation and the sun s direction of motion , is changing as the earth rotates .",
    "we show the angle @xmath71 as a function of @xmath4 , essentially time , for various inclinations @xmath5 .",
    "the intermediate thickness , the short dash , the long dash , the fine line , the long - short dash , the short - long - short dash and the thick line correspond to inclination @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively .",
    "we see that , for negative inclinations , the angle @xmath71 can take values near @xmath77 , i.e. opposite to the direction of the sun s velocity , where the rate attains its maximum.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "up to now we have considered the event rate in a directional experiment in fixed direction with respect to the galaxy in the galactic system discussed above .",
    "the apparatus , of course , will be oriented in a direction specified in the local frame , e.g. by a point in the sky specified , in the equatorial system , by right ascension @xmath4 and inclination and @xmath5 instead of the standard notation @xmath25 and @xmath42 employed by the astronomers to avoid possible confusion stemming from the fact that @xmath25 has already been used to designate the phase of the earth and @xmath42 has been used for the ratio of the rotational velocity of the earth around the sun by the velocity of the sun around the center of the galaxy ] @xmath5 .",
    "this will lead to a diurnal variation of the event rate @xcite .",
    "the galactic frame , in the so called j2000 system , is defined by the galactic pole with ascension @xmath78 and inclination @xmath79 and the galactic center at @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "thus the galactic unit vector @xmath82 , specified by @xmath83 , and the unit vector @xmath84 , specified by @xmath85 , can be expressed in terms of the celestial unit vectors @xmath86 ( beginning of measuring the right ascension ) , @xmath87 ( the axis of the earth s rotation ) and @xmath88 .",
    "one finds @xmath89 note in our system the x - axis is opposite to the s - axis used by the astronomers .",
    "thus a vector oriented by @xmath90 in the laboratory is given in the galactic frame by a unit vector with components : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the right ascension of the equinox , @xmath93 was given above and @xmath94 is the angle the earth s north pole forms with the axis of the galaxy .",
    "+ due to the earth s rotation the unit vector @xmath95 , with a suitable choice of the initial time , @xmath96 , is changing as a function of time    the angle @xmath71 scanned by the direction of observation is shown , for various inclinations @xmath5 , in fig .  3 .",
    "we see that for negative inclinations , the angle @xmath71 can take values near @xmath77 , i.e. opposite to the direction of the sun s velocity , where the rate attains its maximum .",
    "the equipment scans different parts of the galactic sky , i.e. observes different angles @xmath71 . so the rate will change with time depending on whether the sense of the recoiling nucleus can be determined along the line of recoil .",
    "the results depend , of course , on the wimp mass and the target employed .",
    "we will consider a light ( the time dependence of @xmath58 is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdiurnal ] ) and an intermediate - heavy target ( the time dependence of @xmath58 is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : idiurnal ] ) .      for various inclinations",

    "in directional experiments one measures not only the energy of the recoiling nucleus but also the direction the nucleus is recoiling .",
    "some of the requirements that should be met by such detectors have recently been discussed @xcite . to fully exploit the advantages of such detectors one should be able to distinguish between recoils with momenta @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( sense of direction ) , which now appears to be feasible . some of the predicted interesting features of directional event rates persist , however , even if it turns out that the sense of motion of recoils along their line of motion can not be measured .",
    "such experiments , given a sufficient number of events , provide an excellent signature to discriminate against background .",
    "one expects , of course , a smaller rate by observing in a given direction . in the most favored direction ,",
    "opposite to the sun s direction of motion , the event rate is @xmath100 down from that of the standard non directional experiments , if a specific angle @xmath64 is chosen . since , however , @xmath58 is independent of the angle @xmath64 , one can integrate over all azimuthal angles and thus the retardation is only of order @xmath58 ( @xmath101 in the most favored direction).the parameter @xmath58 is essentially independent of any particle model parameters other than the wimp mass .",
    "it does depend , however , on the assumed velocity distribution and to the nuclear form factor .",
    "finally we have seen that in directional experiments the relative event rate for detecting wimps within our galaxy , as given by the parameter @xmath58 , will show a periodic diurnal variation due to the rotation of the earth .",
    "the time variation is larger in the case of light wimp and/or light target .",
    "so from this perspective the lighter target is preferred .",
    "the time variation arising after the inclusion of the modulation parameters ( @xmath102 ) or ( @xmath103 ) is expected to be even more complicated , since these parameters depend on both @xmath71 and @xmath64 .",
    "one expects a diurnal variation on top of the annual variation characteristic of the usual modulation effect entering both directional and non directional experiments .",
    "such effects will be discussed elsewhere .",
