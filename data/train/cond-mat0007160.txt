    "the damping of quantum effects in a system coupled to external degrees of freedom is a fundamental problem of atomic physics , condensed matter physics and quantum optics .",
    "there is great interest in understanding and controlling such damping in well characterised systems .",
    "here we study the damping of quantum effects in the transport properties of a two - dimensional electron gas deposited on the surface of a pool of liquid helium @xcite .",
    "electrons on the surface of helium are vertically confined by their image charges and an ( optional ) applied holding field .",
    "they constitute a two - dimensional electron gas similar to those in semiconductor devices @xcite but with different scattering and damping mechanisms .",
    "electrons may scatter off ripples on the surface of the helium pool ( `` ripplons '' ) or off helium vapour atoms above the liquid surface . above 1 k",
    ", gas atom scattering dominates @xcite , and we concentrate on this regime . on the electronic time - scale ,",
    "the helium vapour atoms are almost stationary and hence similar to impurities in a metal film or a semiconductor device .",
    "thus there are quantum interference corrections to the resistivity at low temperature familiar from studies of transport in metals and semiconductors @xcite .",
    "these corrections result from constructive interference between closed electron paths and their time - reversed counterparts , leading to a small enhancement of the resistance ( `` weak - localization correction '' ) .",
    "the slow movement of helium atoms leads to damping of weak - localization .",
    "there is an important distinction between the effect of vertical and horizontal motion of helium atoms .",
    "roughly , horizontal movement produces damping by scrambling the phase of the interfering paths ; vertical movement , by reducing the weight of contributing paths of long duration .",
    "the effect of horizontal movement has been analysed previously @xcite ; it is the purpose of this paper to study the effect of vertical motion .",
    "the central result is that due to vertical motion of the helium atoms the interference contribution of paths of duration @xmath0 is reduced by a factor @xmath2 .",
    "thus paths of duration greater than the damping time , @xmath3 , are effectively cutoff .",
    "an interesting feature is that damping due to both vertical and horizontal movement of helium atoms is not a simple exponential ; it cuts off more sharply as the exponential of @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions in metals and semiconductors are supposed to produce simple exponential damping .",
    "damping in atomic physics and nuclear magnetic resonance is also commonly a simple exponential ; this is indicated by the lorentzian shape of spectral and magnetic resonance lines @xcite is a lorentzian . ] . as emphasized by afonin _",
    "@xcite in context of quantum transport , the form of damping can be probed by measuring the magnetic field dependence of the weak - localization correction ( `` weak - localization lineshape '' ) . in section iii",
    "we exhibit some lineshapes corresponding to different forms of damping .    weak - localization has been observed in a related system , electrons on a surface of solid hydrogen @xcite . in this system helium vapour",
    "was deliberately introduced above the solid hydrogen to scatter electrons ; thus gas atom damping is relevant to this type of experiment .",
    "more recently , karakurt _ et al .",
    "_ have systematically studied the dependence of the damping rate on various experimental parameters ( electron density ; gas vapour pressure , controlled via temperature ; and holding field ) for electrons on helium @xcite . in this way they have obtained quantitative information on the contributions of different mechanisms to the damping rate .",
    "it is the experiment of karakurt _ et al .",
    "_ that prompted us to carry out the present investigation .    for orientation",
    "it is useful to recall some typical parameters for the experiment of karakurt _ et al .",
    "_ in the absence of a holding field , the electron is bound to the surface by its image .",
    "the charge of the image is reduced from the bare charge of the electron by a factor @xmath5 @xcite ; thus the vertical scale of the electronic wavefunction is 76 @xmath6 .",
    "the lowest vertical subband wavefunction is of the fang - howard form , @xmath7 , at zero holding field ; this form remains an excellent variational ansatz with @xmath8 an adjustable parameter when a holding field is applied . here",
    "@xmath9 denotes the distance of the electron above the helium pool .",
    "the subband spacing is 6 k ; hence for sufficiently low temperatures and electron densities below @xmath10 /m@xmath11 the surface electrons behave like a two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "much of the data of karakurt _ et al .",
    "_ is at temperatures around 2 k and at a typical density of @xmath12 /m@xmath11 corresponding to a fermi temperature of 0.6 mk .",
    "note that their two - dimensional electron gas is therefore non - degenerate in contrast to the situation in metal films and typical semiconductor devices .",
    "thus transport properties are not determined entirely by mono - energetic electrons on the fermi surface ; instead we must sum the boltzman - weighted contribution of electrons of all energies .",
    "the electron - atom collision time inferred from mobility measurements was typically a few ps .",
    "the longest relevant electronic time scale is @xmath13 , the time taken by a thermal electron to move a distance @xmath8 ( see eq 5 below ) . at 2 k and zero holding field @xmath14 ps . in comparison ,",
    "the atom - atom collision time is enormous , of the order of 10 ns .",
    "in this section we analyse the damping produced by the vertical motion of helium vapour atoms .",
    "first we analyse a simple model ( model i ) that captures some of the essential physics , but leads to the incorrect conclusion that the damping factor goes as the exponential of @xmath15 rather than @xmath4 , a result obtained earlier by stephen @xcite .",
    "we then identify a shortcoming of model i and in the next subsection introduce and analyse an improved version ( model ii ) that leads to the correct answer .",
    "in this model we assume that the helium atoms are able to scatter electrons only if they are within a certain distance ( denoted @xmath8 ) from the liquid helium surface .",
    "it is also assumed that the scattering is independent of the precise height of the atom so long as it lies within the prescribed distance .",
    "consider @xmath16 probability that an atom will remain within the scattering distance for a time @xmath0 .",
    "at first let us assume the probability decays exponentially , @xmath17 the numerical coefficient in the exponential is for later convenience . since the motion of vapour atoms is essentially independent the probability that @xmath18 atoms will remain within the scattering distance for time @xmath0 is @xmath19^n = \\exp \\left ( - \\frac { n t } { \\sqrt{\\pi } \\tau_z } \\right).\\ ] ]    weak - localization results from constructive interference between the history in which an electron traverses a particular closed path and the history in which it traverses the same path backwards .",
    "a path of duration @xmath0 involves @xmath20 collisions . for this path to contribute to weak - localization",
    "it is neccessary for all atoms to remain within the electron - scattering region for a duration of order @xmath0 .",
    "hence the fraction of paths of duration @xmath0 that contribute to weak - localization is @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the damping factor ; essentially this result is given in ref @xcite .",
    "this argument must be improved in two ways .",
    "first , it is not neccessary for all the atoms to remain in place for the entire duration of a closed path .",
    "in particular , atoms encountered by the electron in the middle of a closed path are encountered by both the forward and backward path at essentially the same time . at the other extreme",
    ", atoms encountered early on the forward path are encountered towards the end on the backward path , a time @xmath0 later .",
    "thus on average atoms need to remain in place for a time @xmath23 .",
    "hence the damping factor is really @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "a second improvement is needed because eq ( 1 ) is incorrect .",
    "@xmath26 is easily calculated and seen to not be exponential .",
    "here we mention only the relevant features of @xmath26 ; the details are relegated to appendix a. ( i ) as expected on dimensional grounds , @xmath26 is a function of @xmath27 alone , where @xmath28 here @xmath29 mass of a helium atom .",
    "physically , @xmath13 is the time taken by a thermal atom to move a distance @xmath8 .",
    "( ii ) for short times , @xmath30 , we find @xmath31 ( iii ) for long times , @xmath32 , @xmath26 vanishes in a manner not relevant to our purpose .",
    "now the probability that @xmath18 atoms remain near the surface is @xmath33^n & = & \\exp [ n \\ln p(t ) ] \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\exp \\left [ n \\ln \\left ( 1 - \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\tau_z } + \\ldots \\right )   \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & \\exp \\left ( - \\frac { n t } { \\sqrt{\\pi } \\tau_z } \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this shows that for large @xmath18 , @xmath34^n $ ] can be approximated as an exponential only for @xmath35 ; but since it becomes negligible in any case once @xmath36 , there is no significant error in taking @xmath37^n$ ] to be an exponential .",
    "the upshot of this discussion is that although @xmath26 is far from exponential , @xmath38^n$ ] is a simple exponential under appropriate circumstances ; eq ( 2 ) is valid , although eq ( 1 ) is not .",
    "similarly we see that eq ( 4 ) is also valid provided @xmath39 , a condition needed for weak - localization .    in summary , for model",
    "i the damping decays as the exponential of @xmath15 .",
    "provided @xmath40 , it is given by eq ( 4 ) . the atomic time constant @xmath13 is given by eq ( 5 ) .",
    "evidently , the three time scales are arranged in the hierarchy @xmath41 .",
    "the shortcoming of model i is the assumption stated in the first paragraph of the previous subsection .",
    "it is more realistic to assume that the ability of an atom to scatter electrons turns off smoothly as it moves away from the liquid helium surface .",
    "if we treat the atoms as hard core potentials , the contribution of a closed path to the return amplitude is a product of the amplitude for the electron to go to atom 1 , multiplied by the amplitude to scatter off atom 1 , multiplied by the amplitude to go to atom 2 , multiplied by the amplitude to scatter off atom 2 , and so on around the loop .",
    "let @xmath42 be the amplitude to scatter from an atom at height @xmath9 above the helium surface .",
    "model i can be described as the case in which @xmath42 is a step function . here",
    "we choose @xmath43 this is derived by taking the vertical subband wavefunction of the electrons to be of the fang - howard form and treating the helium atom as a short - ranged hard - core potential .",
    "if the helium atoms are only allowed to move vertically the forward and backward paths remain in phase ; however the interference contribution to the return probability is still modified because the forward and backward paths have different amplitudes to scatter from each atom .",
    "we must consider @xmath44 here @xmath0 is the difference in the times at which the atom is encountered on the forward and return path .",
    "the atom is assumed to move ballistically at vertical speed @xmath45 for this time .",
    "@xmath46 denotes an average over all possible configurations of the helium atom ( vertical position is assumed to be uniformly distributed and vertical speed is given by the maxwell - boltzmann formula ) .",
    "introduce the normalization factor @xmath47 defined by @xmath48 here the average over vertical position is performed as in eq ( 9 ) but the velocity distribution is assumed to be a delta function peaked about zero .",
    "@xmath47 is the value of @xmath49 when the atoms do nt move .",
    "let @xmath50 the contribution of paths of duration @xmath0 is then reduced roughly by the factor @xmath51 raised to the power @xmath20 , the number of atoms encountered .",
    "@xmath51 is analogous to @xmath26 for model i. again on dimensional grounds , @xmath51 depends only on the ratio @xmath27 and again we are interested only in the short time behaviour .",
    "this is evaluated in appendix b. the difference from the previous case is that @xmath52 for short times , @xmath53 . the behaviour is quadratic rather than linear ( compare eq 6 ) .",
    "quadratic behaviour is generic ; the linear behaviour for model i is an artifact of the discontinuous step in @xmath42 .",
    "hence @xmath51 raised to the power of @xmath18 is approximately gaussian rather than exponential @xmath54^n \\approx \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{n t^2 } { 3 \\tau_z^2 } \\right).\\ ] ] eq ( 13 ) should be contrasted with eq ( 7 ) above for model i.    to obtain the damping factor , roughly we must replace @xmath18 in eq ( 13 ) by @xmath20 , the number of atoms encountered in a path of duration @xmath0 . before that we must replace @xmath15 in eq ( 13 ) by @xmath55 , its value averaged over the interval from 0 to @xmath0 with uniform weight .",
    "this is to take into account the range in the difference of times at which an atom is encountered along the forward and reversed histories .",
    "the result for the damping factor is @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "eq ( 14 ) is the central result of this paper .",
    "it is valid provided @xmath58 .",
    "karakurt _ et al . _ observed damping by vapour atom motion at low electron density and by electron - electron interaction at high density @xcite . at intermediate densities , damping by both mechanisms was substantial .",
    "vapour atom scattering produces cubic exponential damping ; electron - electron interaction is presumably simple exponential .",
    "_ have pointed out that the weak - localization lineshape depends on the form of damping and they have given an expression for the lineshape in the extreme cases that the damping is entirely simple exponential or entirely cubic exponential .",
    "the purpose of this section is to study the lineshape in the intermediate regime and examine how it crosses over from one extreme form to the other .    for simplicity ,",
    "first let us consider a degenerate electronic system .",
    "assuming that the different damping mechanisms are independent the lineshape is given by @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the fermi energy ; @xmath61 , the sample width ; @xmath62 , the sample length ; @xmath63 the electron diffusion constant ; @xmath64 , the simple exponential damping rate ; and @xmath65 , the cubic exponential damping rate .",
    "energy dependence enters the integrand in eq ( 15 ) through the diffusion constant @xmath66 and through the energy dependence ( if any ) of the time constants @xmath67 and @xmath68 . the @xmath69 factor in eq ( 15 )",
    "may be recognised as the fourier transform of the directed area distribution for closed random walks on a plane @xcite .",
    "it is useful to manipulate eq ( 15 ) into a more revealing form . to this end",
    "introduce the dimensionless variable @xmath70 to obtain @xmath71 here @xmath72 . making use of the asymptotic formula @xmath73 we obtain @xmath74 \\nonumber",

    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eqs ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) constitute the generalisation of the standard weak - localisation lineshape to the case that both @xmath67 and @xmath68 damping are present . for the special case",
    "that there is no @xmath68 damping ( hence @xmath79 ) eqs ( 18,19 ) reduce to the familiar expression involving digamma functions by use of the integral representation @xcite @xmath80 a significant feature revealed by eqs ( 18,19 ) is that the lineshape is universal : @xmath81 does not depend on microscopic length scales .",
    "note that the magnetic field dependence is entirely in the second term of eq ( 18 ) ; the first term is an additive constant .",
    "a practical advantage of eq ( 19 ) over eq ( 15 ) is that the integrand is well behaved for both large and small @xmath82 . in contrast",
    ", the integrand in eq ( 15 ) diverges at the lower end .    to study the crossover in lineshape we fix the damping rate @xmath83 .",

    "we have approximated the fermi function by a boltzman factor and imposed a lower cutoff @xmath95 .",
    "below the cutoff energy the electrons are presumed to be strongly localized and to make an insignificant contribution to the conductance .",
    "these finite temperature considerations make it more difficult to extract the form of damping from the lineshape .",
