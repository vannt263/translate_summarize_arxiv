    "a rather large number of molecule - based magnets have been synthesized and investigated in the last few years@xcite .",
    "they correspond to low - dimensional magnetic systems , either quasi - one - dimensional@xcite or more recently , quasi - two - dimensional@xcite . the one - dimensional compounds are well modeled for equally - spaced magnetic chains , alternating chains involving a unique kind of spin carrier and two kinds of interaction pathways , mixed spin chains , ladder - type double chains , etc ...    this paper is devoted to two - dimensional heisenberg mixed spin compounds in which one of the spins is large enough to be treated as a classical spin and the other is normally treated as a quantum spin .",
    "this work is motivated by the synthesis of novel two - dimensional magnetic materials .",
    "so far , two types of two - dimensional magnetic lattices have been described .",
    "both have a honeycomb - like structure .",
    "the former type is obtained using oxamate as bridging ligand .",
    "mn@xmath0 ions in octahedral surroundings are located at the corners of the hexagons , and cu@xmath0 ions in elongated tetragonal surroundings are located at the middle of the edges .",
    "a strong antiferromagnetic interaction is propagated between the mn@xmath0 and cu@xmath1 ions through the oxamate bridge , so that the intralayer interaction is very large as compared to the interlayer interaction . in these compounds the layers",
    "are negatively charged , and the nature and magnitude of the interlayer interaction is governed by the size of the countercations situated between the layers . in the case of the nbu@xmath2 countercation",
    "a long range magnetic transition was observed at 15 k , probably due to the synergy between a very weak magnetic anisotropy and a ferromagnetic interlayer interaction@xcite .",
    "it has been shown in a previous paper@xcite that our model leads to an excellent interpretation of the magnetic properties of this material .",
    "the parameters were found as @xmath3 47.6 k , @xmath4 = 2.0 and @xmath5 = 2.2 .",
    "these values are very close to those obtained for both cu@xmath0mn@xmath0 pairs @xcite and chains @xcite involving the same bridge .",
    "the value of the interaction parameter essentially depends on the nature of the bridging network , and is not very sensitive to the spin geometry .",
    "the latter type of lattice is realised in a series of two - dimensional oxalate - bridged bimetallic compounds which have just been synthesized@xcite . in that case",
    "the two kinds of magnetic ions alternate at the corners of the hexagons .",
    "the layers which are again negatively charged are separated by countercations .",
    "the general formula of these componds is ( nbu@xmath6)[m@xmath7ru@xmath8(ox)@xmath9 where m@xmath7 is either mn@xmath7 ( @xmath105/2 ) or fe@xmath7 ( @xmath102 ) or cu@xmath7 ( @xmath101/2 ) and the spin carried by the high - field ru@xmath11 ion is @xmath12(ru ) = 1/2 .",
    "the interaction is ferromagnetic for mn and antiferromagnetic for cu and fe .  in the latter case",
    "a ferromagnetic transition occurs at @xmath13k .",
    "let us mention that other compounds with the same structure have been reported@xcite .",
    "the nature of the spin carriers , however , does not allow to use the classical - quantum spin approach .",
    "+    the aim of this paper is to study the influence of the geometry of the spin lattice on the thermodynamical properties of such systems . in this way",
    ", we derive from the mixed quantum - classical heisenberg model a purely classical one with an effective interaction which depends on the lattice geometry .",
    "this model is analysed by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "we investigate the different realisations of the hexagonal lattice described above , but also two configurations based on the square lattice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the model is developed in the first section , then the monte carlo analysis is presented , and the results are discussed in the last section .",
    "let us write down the heisenberg spin hamiltonian as : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the large spin operator ( 5/2 for mn , 2 for fe ) which will be approximated by a classical vector , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a unit vector and @xmath18.the @xmath19 spin quantum operator ( for cu or ru ) is denoted by @xmath20 with @xmath21 the pauli matrices .",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath22 is positive for an antiferromagnetic interaction ( in the following , we only consider this case ) ; @xmath23 is a weak magnetic field applied along the @xmath24 direction .",
    "@xmath25 stands for a pair of nearest neighbour spins , @xmath26 is the number of classical spins and @xmath27 is the number of quantum spins .",
    "two kinds of magnetic lattices are investigated , the hexagonal one , which has been realised experimentally , and the square one . for each lattice ,",
    "the spins can be arranged in two fashions : either the classical spins are attached at each vertex , and the quantum spins occupy the middle of the links , or the classical and quantum spins alternate at the vertices of the lattice .",
    "the structures are schematized in figure 1 ( a ) to ( d ) .    in all cases ,",
    "a quantum spin is surrounded only by classical ones .",
    "therefore , the partition function can be factorized with respect to the quantum spin operators : @xmath28\\right ) \\right\\ } ~\\exp \\left ( \\beta g_{1}\\mu _ { b}s\\,h{\\bf \\cdot } % \\sum_{j=1}^{n_{c}}s_{j}^{z}\\right)\\ ] ] in this expression , @xmath29 is the set of labels of the classical spins nearest neighbours of the quantum spin at site @xmath30 .",
    "let us call this set of classical spins a _ unit cell_. depending on the lattice , the unit cell is a link ( lattices ( a ) and ( c ) of figure 1 ) , a triangular plaquette ( lattice ( d ) ) or a square plaquette ( lattice ( b ) ) . due to the factorized form of @xmath31",
    ", the quantum spin dependence can be traced out to give a fully classical partition function : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the set of unit cells on the lattice .",
    "the original mixed spin system is then equivalent to a classical one with an effective ferromagnetic interaction between the classical spins on the plaquettes @xmath33 which becomes ( in zero field ) : @xmath34 in the following , we shall use the notations @xmath35    the various observables , like the heat capacity @xmath36 and the zero field suceptibility @xmath37 are simple generalisations of the ones defined in ref.@xcite and can be expressed as ensemble averages with respect to the boltzmann weight @xmath38 . by defining @xmath39 , we find that the internal energy and the specific heat are given by @xmath40 + k_{b}\\left\\langle \\phi \\right\\rangle _ { { \\cal h}_{{\\rm eff}}}\\quad \\text{with% } \\quad \\phi = \\sum_{\\{\\gamma \\}}\\left [ \\frac{k\\,w{(\\gamma ) } } { \\cosh ( k\\,w{% ( \\gamma ) } ) } \\right ] ^{2 }   \\label{cv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the molar magnetic susceptibility is obtained from eq.([zq ] ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of molecules and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 have the following expression , @xmath46 and @xmath47 as a function of the temperature for the four lattices can be provided on request . ] : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "these various thermodynamical quantities are determined by monte carlo sampling , with respect to the boltzmann weight @xmath51 .",
    "the simulations were first performed using the metropolis method @xcite .",
    "this method has been proved to be very useful at high temperature , far from the phase transition .",
    "however , it suffers from a severe slowing down near the phase transition , and therefore becomes rather inefficient at low temperature , since , for an isotropic two - dimensional system , the critical temperature is @xmath52k@xcite .",
    "a cluster flipping method developed by wolff @xcite drastically reduces the slowing down , and the wolff algorithm was used for high values of @xmath53 ( i.e. low values of @xmath54 ) . to overcome the finite size effects in the critical region",
    ", we increased the size of the systems as @xmath54 decreased .",
    "the number of cells is 2@xmath55 for @xmath56 , and increases up to 2@xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were imposed to the system , and a random spin configuration was taken as an initial spin configuration .",
    "the number of metropolis steps necessary to reach the termal equilibrium was found to be between 10@xmath59 and 10@xmath60 lattice sweeps depending on the temperature .",
    "the averaging of the various observables was stopped when @xmath61 .",
    "the relative uncertainty on the energy and the specific heat was then better than 10@xmath62 .",
    "these calculations were performed on a cray j916 .",
    "+      figure 2 shows the behaviour of @xmath63 ( in @xmath64 k mol@xmath65 units ) as a function of the temperature ( in units of @xmath22 ) for the four lattice configurations .",
    "the four curves present the same general trend characterised by the following features :    * a constant value at high temperature corresponding to the paramagnetic limit ; * a shallow minimum , characteristic of a ferrimagnetic system with antiferromagnetic couplings .",
    "it is due to the local ordering appearing as the temperature is lowered , and which causes a decrease of the local magnetisation ; * a rapid increase at low temperature due to the critical divergence at @xmath66 .",
    "it is interesting to determine the extent to which all these results can be described by the same universal trend , simply corrected by the lattice effects .",
    "actually , at high temperature , the susceptibility is given by the curie constant which depends in a simple way on the spin arrangement : @xmath67 \\label{curie}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the numbers of low spin ( quantum ) and high spin ( classical ) ions per molecule , respectively ( these numbers are given in table i for each lattice ) .",
    "in equation ( [ curie ] ) we have taken @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "for the curves of figure 2 we set @xmath72    .coefficients of the high temperature expansion for @xmath73 for the four lattices . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    by substracting the specific quantum contribution given by eq.([cvq ] ) and renormalising the temperature dependence of the residual specific heat by the factor defined in the preceding section , we should obtain a universal curve .",
    "this is what we can observe in figure 5 , where the dependence of the lattice has been washed out by comparison with figure 3 .",
    "in this paper we have determined the effect of the topology of the spin lattice on the thermodynamical properties of two - dimensional systems with alternating quantum - classical spins , modeling a wide family of magnetic molecular compounds .",
    "since the quantum spin dependence can be traced out , we can used the very powerful _",
    "classical _ monte - carlo techniques to analyse these systems .",
    "we found that the temperature dependence of both the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat can be described on the ground of general behaviours on which the lattice influence is explicited .",
    "this analysis allows one to predict in principle what would be the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility for other compounds with different spin geometry .",
    "alternatively , it can be used to determine the interaction parameters together with the zeeman factors out of experimental data@xcite .    in most cases@xcite",
    ", one observes experimentally at low temperature ( typically 10 to 15k ) a transition towards a ferromagnetic ordered phase which can not be accomodated within our isotropic interaction @xcite .",
    "therefore , the present analysis is only valid in the paramagnetic phase . at low temperature ,",
    "spin anisotropy@xcite and/or spatial anisotropy must be taken into account to explain this ferromagnetic phase transition .",
