    "the efficient use of energy in systems where a relative motion between a solid wall and a fluid takes place is perhaps the most important driving factor that supports the research effort into aerodynamic drag reduction .",
    "a significant body of literature is devoted to devising and testing methods for reducing the turbulent skin - friction drag , which arises from the interaction between turbulence and a wall even in the most simplified geometry ( plane channel flow ) , and is also a key source of aerodynamic drag in many important applications .",
    "several existing control strategies belong to the class of active methods , that are located midway between the interestingly simple passive methods , e.g. riblets @xcite , and the interestingly effective closed - loop ( feedback ) control methods @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the effectiveness of the former is still too limited to justify their deployment in applications , whereas the latter definitely lack simplicity , since the required large number of miniaturized sensors and actuators still prevents their near - future employment @xcite . within a third and intermediate category , other drag reduction techniques , referred to as open - loop , provide higher drag reduction than existing passive methods while being less complex than feedback - control methods . in particular , open - loop techniques that rely on the spanwise forcing of the near - wall turbulent flow have been shown to yield large reduction of friction drag and interestingly positive energy budgets in numerical simulations @xcite , and first laboratory experiments have already been carried out @xcite .",
    "the present paper deals with the spanwise oscillating - wall technique , i.e. the cyclic movement of the wall in the spanwise direction @xcite .",
    "although providing limited performance , especially in terms of net energy savings , the sinusoidal wall oscillation is representative of a larger group @xcite , and is one of the simplest available techniques , since only two control parameters exist , i.e. the oscillation period and the maximum wall velocity during the cycle ( also referred to as oscillation amplitude ) .",
    "most existing open - loop control strategies assume a sinusoidal waveform for a control input without a compelling theoretical basis .",
    "when attempting to verify these control strategies in experiments , however , various constraints are inevitably placed on the properties of the control input by the employed actuators , and the waveform is often non - sinusoidal by practical necessity .",
    "for example , the streamwise - traveling - wave in the milano pipe experiment @xcite had to deal with a streamwise distribution of the spanwise velocity which was not sinusoidal , but piecewise - constant .",
    "the experimental realization of the oscillating wall concept by gouder _",
    "@xcite was limited by the maximum displacement achievable by their actuator .",
    "the plasma actuators by k .-",
    "s.choi @xcite produced a localized forcing that was just an approximation of the sinusoidal distribution originally employed in the numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "hence , it is of particular importance to identify the optimal waveform to achieve best control performance among those realizable with a certain actuator .",
    "quadrio & ricco @xcite were the first to mention that , in flow control with wall oscillation , a third parameter besides oscillation period and amplitude enters the picture , i.e. the maximum displacement of the wall during the oscillation cycle .",
    "if the wall oscillates sinusoidally in time , however , only two of these three parameters are independent , and for example the maximum displacement can be deduced once period and amplitude are known . in the present paper , we intend to truly open up the third dimension in the parameters space , by investigating the behavior of the oscillating wall when the temporal waveform is considered as a free parameter , and the constraint of sinusoidal oscillation is lifted .",
    "given the highly non - linear process that in principle links the oscillation of the wall and the reduction of the turbulent drag , the control performance for arbitrary waveforms can not be predicted based on the present knowledge . as a starting point",
    ", we select a set of waveforms and study , via several numerical experiments , how the drag - reduction and energetic performances of the oscillating wall depend on the waveform as well as on the oscillation amplitude and period . in this process",
    ", we opt for comparing different periodic waveforms at the same oscillation amplitude and period .",
    "although different criteria could have been employed ( e.g. considering waveforms with the same period and displacement , or with the same power input ) , these two parameters characterize in a simple way the main features of a generic waveform and play a first - order role in determining the control performance .",
    "guided by our numerical experiments , in this paper we aim at obtaining results of general validity , so that a predictive tool for the control performance of non - sinusoidal wall oscillations can eventually be developed . in this process , we take advantage of the laminar solution that exists for the spanwise flow alone : the stokes oscillating boundary layer .",
    "this laminar solution has been shown @xcite to describe the average spanwise turbulent flow for sinusoidal wall oscillations and has been used @xcite to interpret some turbulent drag reduction properties of the oscillating wall .",
    "quadrio and ricco @xcite extended this solution to the case of streamwise - traveling waves , and introduced the analytical expression of the so - called generalized stokes oscillating layer . here ,",
    "we attempt a complementary generalization to account for a generic ( periodic ) temporal waveform .",
    "the performance of non - sinusoidal spanwise wall oscillations is assessed using direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of a turbulent channel flow .",
    "we employ a computer code @xcite that solves the incompressible navier ",
    "stokes equations written in terms of wall - normal velocity and vorticity .",
    "discretization is spectral ( dealiased fourier ) in the homogeneous @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions , whereas compact , explicit fourth - order finite differences are used in the wall - normal @xmath2 direction .",
    "time advancement is carried out with a partially implicit , third - order crank  nicholson / runge  kutta scheme .",
    "the reynolds number of the reference simulation without wall oscillation is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the bulk velocity , @xmath5 is half the channel gap and @xmath6 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "this corresponds to a value of the friction - based reynolds number @xmath7 . unless otherwise specified , @xmath5 and @xmath4 are chosen as length and velocity scales .",
    "the computational domain is @xmath8 along @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 directions , with a number of modes ( before dealiasing ) or grid points of @xmath9 respectively , which yields a spatial resolution ( for the reference case ) of @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; wall - normal resolution varies from @xmath12 near the wall to @xmath13 at the centerline ( the superscript @xmath14 as customary implies non - dimensionalization in viscous units , where the friction velocity @xmath15 of the reference flow is used ) .",
    "every simulation is started from the same initial condition of fully developed turbulent channel flow with stationary wall .",
    "when the wall moves , drag reduction takes place : since the flow rate is kept constant , the space - averaged streamwise pressure gradient and the friction drag decrease .",
    "the total integration time for each simulation is @xmath16 wash - out time units , corresponding to @xmath17 viscous time units . after the beginning of the oscillating movement of the walls at @xmath18 ,",

    "the investigated waveforms @xmath29 , which include the sinusoid , are sketched in figure [ fig : waveforms ] ; they are representative of the different features which may characterize non - sinuosidal oscillations in practice , featuring discontinuities in velocity and acceleration profiles , large and small accelerations , phase shifts and different fractions of the period with constant velocity and even zero velocity . for every waveform ,",

    "the alternating boundary layer created by a sinusoidally oscillating wall in a quiescent fluid is described by the solution of the so - called stokes second problem @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this laminar solution also describes well the spanwise component of a turbulent channel or pipe flow modified by the sinusoidally oscillating wall , when properly averaged in space and considered as a function of the oscillation phase .",

    "these data points correspond to cases at the largest oscillation periods , where it is known that drag reduction vanishes and the interaction between the streamwise turbulent flow and the slowly oscillating stokes layer trivially becomes a cyclic reorientation of the former by the latter . for forcing periods @xmath109 , the right panel of figure [ fig : prediction ] shows how data for all the waveforms show a linear scaling when @xmath110 is used as independent variable , where @xmath111 accounts for the physical process of diffusion .",

    "this implies that non - sinusoidal wall oscillations , at least for @xmath115 , can not yield better @xmath60 than the corresponding sinusoid with the same @xmath131 .",

    "along the same reasoning , however , locations in the @xmath136-space do exist where non - sinusoidal oscillations yield better @xmath60 than the sinusoid .",
    "for example , waveform @xmath70 is found to work better than the sinusoid in the high-@xmath34 regions of the @xmath137-space .",

    "at the same time the contributions of the higher modes @xmath82 for @xmath139 is rapidly decreasing , since @xmath140 .",
    "this means that this particular waveform has a carrier sinusoidal wave that works near the optimal conditions @xmath141 , and the decrease of performances due to the harmonics @xmath82 for @xmath139 is not large enough to worsen the overall net energy saving .",
    "this fact is potentially important for applications where technological constraints might force the wall movement within a suboptimal region of the @xmath137 space : using non - sinusoidal waveforms with carefully designed energy spectrum might help increasing the control performances . given the maximum value of @xmath60 fixed at @xmath141 , the distribution of @xmath60 in the parameter space around this optimum can be improved with non - sinusoidal oscillations . as an example , we designed a waveform aimed at optimizing performance within the reasonable practical constraint of remaining in the low-@xmath34 region .",
    "according to the previous arguments , in this region a waveform should be designed where the first mode is larger than the single sinusoid with the same amplitude . by considering only two modes ,",
    "we have used @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the resulting waveform is the solid line in the right plot of figure [ fig : r_scaling ] , where the two contributing modes are shown by dashed lines . by means of dns",

    "are first identified and then generalized thanks to analytical considerations .",
    "based on these findings a model is presented which allows predicting the flow control performance for the generic waveform .",
    "for sinusoidal wall oscillations it is already known that the stokes layer turns out to be basically insensitive to the background turbulence while it does strongly affect the physics of near - wall turbulence , resulting in significant reduction of the skin - friction drag . in this case",

    "to connect the laminar solution for the stokes layer to the turbulent drag - reduction properties , a key step is that of re - defining the penetration length @xmath98 of the stokes layer as the wall distance where the mean squared value of the oscillating velocity decreases below a threshold value . for @xmath115 ,",
    "properties of the laminar solution are shown to correlate well with the turbulent drag reduction rate .",
    "moreover , we propose a simple formula that predicts analytically with very good accuracy the global performance of the oscillating wall for the generic temporal waveform , and in particular its net energy saving @xmath60 .",
    "the present analytical considerations show that the sinusoidal waveform gives the overall best net energy saving in the single point @xmath147 of the parameter space .",
    "the developed model provides a new , simple criterion to design a waveform that allows outperforming the sinusoid in locations of the parameter space that differ from @xmath147 . in other words ,",
    "the present results are not the trivial superposition of well - known results for the sinusoidal components into which a general waveform can be decomposed . indeed , while the overall power consumption is the sum of the different harmonic contributions , the drag reduction and consequently the net energy saving are not . although the variance of the stokes profile depends linearly on the different harmonic contributions , the resulting penetration length @xmath98 , which is the scaling parameter that is linked to the turbulent drag reduction rate , is not the simple sum of the various penetration lengths from the different harmonics .    as a concluding note ,",
    "let us recall how it is now recognized that moving ahead from the temporal oscillation of the wall ( temporal stokes layer , tsl ) to the space - varying oscillation @xcite ( spatial stokes layer , ssl ) and then to the spatio - temporal oscillation , i.e. the streamwise - travelling waves by quadrio et al @xcite ( generalized stokes layer , gsl ) brings about significant improvements of performance , while the underlying physics is very much unaffected .",
    "the present work should thus be regarded as the first step towards the long - term aim of building a predictive tool that should be able to deal with the most general case . in this sense ,",
    "the ultimate goal of our research effort is considering a generalized stokes layer with the further generalization of letting the temporal and spatial waveform free to assume an arbitrary shape .    the authors would like to acknowledge the support of the german academic exchange service ( daad ) for andrea cimarelli , of the japan society for the promotion of science ( jsps ) postdoctoral fellowship for research abroad for yosuke hasegawa as well as the support of the german research foundation ( dfg ) through project fr2823/2 - 1 .",
    "the infrastructure for carrying out this project was provided by the center of smart interfaces at tu darmstadt which is greatly acknowledged .",
