    "in the last few years , an increasing attention has been paid to possible nonextensive effects in the fields of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics .",
    "the main motivation is the lack of a comprehensive treatment including gravitational and coulombian fields for which the assumed additivity of the entropy present in the standard approach is not valid [ 1 - 2 ] .",
    "inspired on such problems , as well as in the traditional ensemble theory , tsallis@xcite proposed a remarkable @xmath0-parameterized nonextensive entropic expression which reduces to the extensive gibbs - jaynes - shannon entropy in the limiting case @xmath4 ( see @xcite for a regularly updated bibliography on this subject ) .",
    "later on , the first attempts exploring the kinetic route associated to this nonextensive approach appeared in the literature[5 - 10 ] . the original kinetic derivation advanced by maxwell@xcite was generalized to include power law distributions as required by this enlarged framework .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the equilibrium velocity @xmath0-distribution @xmath5^{1/(1-q)},\\ ] ] is uniquely determined from two simple requirements@xcite : ( i ) isotropy of the velocity space , and ( ii ) a suitable nonextensive generalization of the maxwell factorizability condition , or equivalently , the assumption that @xmath6 .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 above denotes the @xmath0-dependent normalization constant whose expression on the interval @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the particle number density , @xmath11 is the mass and @xmath12 is the temperature . as expected , in the limiting case @xmath4 , such expressions reduce to the standard maxwellian ones@xcite .",
    "more recently , the kinetic foundations of the above distribution were investigated in a deeper level through the generalized boltzmann s transport equation@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the @xmath0-nonextensive integral source term measuring the change in @xmath15 due to collisions .",
    "this boltzmannian like approach incorporated the nonextensive effects using two different ingredients .",
    "first , a new functional form to the kinetic local gas entropy , and , second , a nonfactorizable distribution function for the colliding pairs of particles whose physical meaning is quite clear : the boltzmann chaos molecular hypothesis is not valid in this extended framework .",
    "it was also shown that the kinetic version of the tsallis entropy satisfies an @xmath16-theorem , and more important still , the @xmath0-parameterized class of power law velocity distributions emerged as the unique nonextensive solution describing the equilibrium states .    in this paper",
    "we go one step further by computing the basic nonextensive transport coefficients for dilute gases and plasmas . due to the intricate form of the new collisional term ,",
    "we adopt here the relaxation - time model proposed by bhatnager , gross and krook@xcite because it permits an exact mathematical treatment . in spite of its limitation , the relaxation - time model ( henceforth bgk model )",
    "has been proved quite useful from a methodological viewpoint because it yields the correct answer to the problem in a first approximation , and as such , it can guide us to the correct nonextensive results which must rigorously be obtained using the full @xmath0-transport equation .",
    "as we shall see , analytical expressions for the transport coefficients of a dilute gas are readily obtained with basis on the local @xmath0-nonextensive distribution . in particular , we show that the available experimental results to the ratio @xmath1/@xmath2 constrains the @xmath0-parameter on the interval @xmath3 . as expected , in the extensive limiting case , the classical expressions of the transport coefficients are readily recovered .",
    "however , due to a surprising cancellation , the standard electric conductivity of a dilute neutral plasma is not modified .",
    "the analysis presented here is also compared with independent calculations based on rather different approaches@xcite .",
    "let us now consider a dilute gas whose particles are acted by external forces",
    ". in the bgk approximation the @xmath0-transport equation ( [ beq ] ) reads : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the external force and @xmath11 is the mass of the particles . in this approximation",
    ", @xmath19 is the local equilibrium distribution function and @xmath20 is a relaxation time which is a number of the order of the collision time .",
    "we recall that under stationary conditions the distribution function does not depend on time , however , the concentration , and the temperature , are local quantities .",
    "the whole system is assumed to be out but close to the local stationary equilibrium state@xcite .",
    "in particular , this means that the resulting nonequilibrium distribution , @xmath21 , is only slightly different from the equilibrium unperturbed stationary distribution , @xmath22 , and can be approximated as latexmath:[\\[\\label{oi } f({\\bf r},{\\bf v})=f_0({\\bf v},{\\bf r})+g({\\bf v},{\\bf r}),\\quad    nonextensive distribution on the thermal conductivity @xmath1 .",
    "it will be assumed that the heat flux is macroscopically governed by the classical fourier law @xmath24 while , microscopically , it is expressed as the usual average value of the perturbed kinetic energy flow@xcite @xmath25 as one may check , in the absence of external forces , the bgk model leads to @xmath26 substituting ( [ g ] ) into ( [ eq17 ] ) , and rewriting the resulting expression in spherical coordinates @xmath27 , one obtains @xmath28 d\\phi.\\ ] ] before proceed further , we note that the orthogonality relation @xmath29 where @xmath30 , may be used to show that the angular integral can be written as @xmath31 d\\phi = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}v^2 \\frac{\\partial { \\it f_0}}{\\partial{\\bf r}},\\ ] ] with equation ( [ eq19 ] ) simplifying to @xmath32 as remarked earlier , the concentration @xmath10 and the temperature @xmath12 in the local @xmath0-distribution are spatially dependent while the pressure remains constant .",
    "thus , as a consequence of the extended virial theorem@xcite , one may write @xmath33 , and combining that with the spatial gradient of the unperturbed distribution , the heat flow can be rewritten as @xmath34^{q/(1-q)}\\frac{mv^2}{2k_bt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath35^{1/(1-q)}\\}\\frac{\\partial { \\it t}}{\\partial{\\bf r}}dv.\\ ] ] now , comparing with the fourier law ( [ eq26 ] ) , we obtain an integral expression for the nonextensive thermal conductivity @xmath36^{q/(1-q)}dv\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath37^{1/(1-q)}dv.\\ ] ]    the above integrals can easily be evaluated .",
    "we find @xmath38^{q/(1-q)}dv=\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath39 and , @xmath40^{1/(1-q)}dv=\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath41 as one may check , inserting these integrals and the normalization constant @xmath7 into equation ( [ eq27 ] ) , we obtain @xmath42.\\ ] ] the nonextensive parameter @xmath0 in the above expressions are restricted to positive values with @xmath43,@xmath44 .",
    "note also that expression ( [ eq30 ] ) reduces to standard value in the extensive limiting case@xcite @xmath45 it thus follows that the ratio between the nonextensive thermal conductivity and the extensive value , @xmath46 , is dependent on the tsallis thermostatistics through parameter @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . note that for values of @xmath0 smaller than unity , the corresponding coefficient @xmath1 can be much smaller than the standard result ( nearly @xmath47 for @xmath48 ) , while for @xmath49 it may increases without limit .",
    "let us now consider the nonextensive effects on the viscosity coefficient . in this case , the particles of the gas do not move with the same velocity . in a simplified treatment ,",
    "the particles have constant mean velocity @xmath50 in the @xmath51 direction with the magnitude of @xmath50 depending only on @xmath52 , that is , @xmath53 .",
    "thus , neglecting bulk viscosity , the navier - stokes stress reduces to    @xmath54    a complementary hypothesis is that the collisional state tend to produce a local equilibrium distribution relative to the moving gas with mean velocity @xmath50 . under such conditions ,",
    "the stationary @xmath0-distribution becomes @xmath55^{1/(1-q)},\\ ] ] where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "since the resulting distribution @xmath15 is stationary but also depends on @xmath52 ( the direction of the gradient velocity ) , the bgk equation ( [ eq1 ] ) now reads @xmath59 the perturbed distribution function obeys @xmath60 so that @xmath61 in order to calculate the component @xmath62 of the stress tensor , we consider its kinetic definition@xcite @xmath63 following standard lines we see that ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath64 and comparing this result with the macroscopic equation ( [ eq39 ] ) we find @xmath65 where @xmath66^{q/(1-q)}mu_x\\ ] ] replacing ( [ eq41 ] ) into ( [ eq40 ] ) it follows that @xmath67^{q/(1-q)}u_z^2u_x^2,\\ ] ] and performing the elementary integrals @xmath68 finally , substituting the expression of @xmath7 and cancelling out the common factors , the viscosity coefficient assumes the rather simple form @xmath69 this expression is valid only for @xmath70 , and as expected , in the limit @xmath71 it reduces to the standard extensive result@xcite @xmath72    in figure 2 we show the ratio @xmath73 as a function of the nonextensive parameter .",
    "this plot is similar to what happens with the thermal conductivity ( see fig.1 ) , and as expected , only for @xmath4 the standard maxwellian result is recovered . note also that combining equations ( [ eq30 ] ) and ( [ eq44 ] ) we also obtain a quite simple expression to the dimensionless ratio , @xmath74 , involving the transport coefficients , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , namely @xmath75 such a quantity ( sometimes called eucken s ratio@xcite ) plays an important experimental role because the unknown collision time appearing in both transport coefficients cancels out in this ratio . in figure 3 , we plot @xmath74 as a function of @xmath0 . note that @xmath74 does not depend on the temperature , and for @xmath4 it reduces to the extensive result @xmath76@xcite . as widely known , this pure number lies experimentally within the range @xmath77@xcite .",
    "therefore , the allowed values to the nonextensive parameter is restricted on the interval @xmath3 , thereby showing that the maxwellian result is only marginally compatible with such measurements .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the departure from standard maxwellian prediction is usually taken as an indication that the energy of the molecules must include another forms than mere kinetic energy of translation , or equivalently , an anomalous specific heat@xcite .",
    "however , as we have seen , a possible alternative explanation ( at least for monatomic gases ) is provided by the existence of nonextensive effects associated to tsallis thermostatistics .    for completeness",
    ", we now investigate the possible nonextensive effects on the electric conductivity of a dilute neutral plasma .",
    "as before , we consider the bgk approximation assuming that the external electric field is uniform and points to the positive @xmath52 direction , that is , @xmath78 .",
    "the relevant macroscopic equation is now the ohm s law @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the electric conductivity .",
    "microscopically , the electric current density is defined as the statistical average@xcite @xmath81 where the subscript @xmath10 means that the charge flow is directed along the normal to the corresponding surface element .",
    "note that only the component _",
    "j@xmath82 _ does not vanish since for an homogeneous and isotropic medium the current * j * is parallel to the electric field .",
    "as one may check , from equations ( [ eq0 ] ) , ( [ oi ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) it follows that @xmath83^{q/(1-q)}v_z^2.\\ ] ] performing the integration and comparing to the ohm s law the resulting electric conductivity is @xmath84 or still , inserting the value of @xmath7 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) ) @xmath85 therefore , within the bgk approximation , the above cancellation results that the electric conductivity does not depend on the nonextensive @xmath0-parameter .",
    "in this paper we discussed some possible nonextensive effects on the transport phenomena in gases and plasmas .",
    "it was shown that the theoretical analysis based on the relaxation - time approximation lead to simple analytic expressions to the heat conduction and viscosity coefficients , while the electric conductivity was not modified .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results ( and the overall approach ) with independent analyzes and some previous expressions to nonextensive transport coefficients appearing in the literature@xcite .",
    "we first notice that our main results are quite different from that ones obtained by boghosian@xcite .",
    "probably , the basic reason comes from the fact that in his paper it was advocated a different choice to the bgk operator , namely , @xmath86 .",
    "note that it depends nonlinearly on the nonextensive parameter and should be compared with the standard bgk operator assumed in the present paper ( see our equation ( [ eq1 ] ) ) . in the treatment adopted here , the nonextensive effects appear only implicitly through the power law equilibrium distribution . in addition ,",
    "boghosian ( and also the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite ) assumed that the pressure in the perturbed gas does not remain constant thereby giving rise to an anomalous heat conduction ( @xmath87 in their notation ) . in this concern ,",
    "our approach may be considered more conservative . as a matter of fact , using the extended virial theorem @xcite , we have assumed constant pressure as usually done in the bgk approximation so that the anomalous heat conduction coefficient , @xmath87 , is absent .",
    "another crucial difference among these works is that three kinds of averaging methods has been considered .",
    "boghosian@xcite and potiguar et al.@xcite employed unnormalized and normalized @xmath0-expectations values , respectively , while we have computed the averages in the usual manner . in this way , it is not surprising that although obtaining coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 proportional to the temperature , the behavior of the dimensionless ratio @xmath88 as a function of the @xmath0 parameter is quite different ( compare our equation ( [ ratio ] ) with equations ( 83 ) and ( 40 ) in the quoted papers ) .",
    "since this ratio can be measured in laboratory , hopefully , these different approaches , as well as their basic underlying assumptions will be experimentally confronted in the near future .",
