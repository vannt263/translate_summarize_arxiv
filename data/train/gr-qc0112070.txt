    "although a scalar field has not been observed in nature as a fundamental field its use as such is very frequent in the modern literature , particularly in elementary particles , field theory and cosmology . here",

    "remarkable in the discrete field is that it has none of the problems that plague the continuum one so that the meaning and origin of these problems can be left exposed on the passage from the discrete to the continuum formalism .",

    "we will see here that this can not be extended to gravity in the presence of massive sources ; a true second - order tensor field is required .",
    "the reader should be aware , however , that this is not a paper about a new theory of gravity ; it is about the meaning and implications of an assumed discreteness of all matter and interactions , particularly of the scalar ones .",

    "this demarcating point is for very large distances where @xmath78 may even become detectable so that the field asymptotic limit should reveal its discrete nature .",
    "actually this possibility is spoiled , in the case of a matter - polarizing field like the electromagnetic one , by the shielding effect : the field is cancelled before @xmath78 grows to the point of detectability .",
    "this , of course , does not happen to gravity and so effects of this expected discreteness must be observable , but this discussion will be deferred to section vi",
    ".    careful observation at such small and large distances should reveal that the intensity of the actual interaction , respectively , grows and decreases at a smaller rate than the theoretical prediction from a continuous interaction .",
    "when observed , in a context of continuous interactions , these effects may require the use of regularization and renormalization techniques or may give origin to various misleading interpretations like the existence of new form of fundamental continuous interactions or of strange and yet to be observed form of matter , for example . in practice a detailed strictly discrete calculus",
    "is not always necessary and in some cases may not even be feasible .",
    "calculus ( integration and differentiation ) in a discrete - interaction context becomes a useful approximation for a rigourous description of fundamental physical processes .",
    "what effectively counts is the scale determined by @xmath90 , the time interval between two consecutive interaction events , face the accuracy of the measuring apparatus .",
    "the question is if @xmath90 is large enough to be detectable , or how accurate is the measuring apparatus used to detect it .",
    "the density of interaction points on the worldline of a given point charge is proportional to the number of point charges with which it interacts .",
    "let us consider the most favourable case of a system made of just two point charges . as the argument is supposedly valid for all fundamental interactions one can take the hydrogen atom in its ground state for consideration , treating the proton , for simplicity , as if it were also an elementary point particle .",
    "the order of scale of @xmath90 for an electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom is can be taken en by the bohr radius divided by the speed of light @xmath92 which corresponds to a number of @xmath93 interactions per period ( @xmath94 is the fine - structure constant ) or @xmath95 interactions / cm .",
    "so , the electron world line is so densely packed with interaction events that one can , in an effectively good description for most of the cases , replace the graph of the figure 2 by a continuously smooth curve .",
    "the validity of calculus in physics is then fully re - established in the interval between the two critical points as a consequence of the limitations of the measuring apparatus .",
    "the wigner s questions@xcite about the unexpected effectiveness of mathematics in the physical description of the world is recalled .",
    "the answer lies on the huge number of point sources in interaction , the large value of the speed of light and the small ( in a manly scale ) size of atomic and sub - atomic systems , which indirectly is a consequence of h , the planck constant .    even in these situations where @xmath90 may not be measurable , at least with the present technology ,",
    "the discrete formalism is justified not for replacing the continuum one where it is best , which is confirmed by high precision experiments @xcite , but mostly for defining and explaining its limitations .",
    "there are , besides this very generic justification , many instances of one - interaction - event phenomena , like the compton effect , particle decay , radiation emission from bound - state systems , etc , where discrete interactions are the natural and the more appropriate approach .",
    "these are , of course , all examples of quantum phenomena , but primarily because quantum here implies discreteness .",
    "it would be interesting to have a framework where this change from continuum to discrete interaction and vice - versa could be formally realized in a simple and direct way .",
    "one can deal with it considering the behaviour under a derivative operator of @xmath96 which is the mathematical description of the interaction discreteness .",

    "this points to an overall picture where the so called matter fields are fermions which are described by first - order equations whilst the fundamental ( vectorial and tensorial ) bosons are gauge fields whose meaning and origin , as discrete fields , we discuss now .",
    "it is worthwhile , after seing eq .",
    "( [ dda ] ) , to recall how the discrete field concept enlightens @xcite the meaning and origin of gauge fields . what is behind a gauge symmetry ?",
    "a discrete field is characterized by its ( free ) propagation without a change between two consecutive interaction events .",
    "a  derivative \" of a discrete field @xmath101 , which is a derivative along the field straight line support , is , therefore , identically null in this time interval .",
    "it is then , by definition , as a local function at a point @xmath102 lim _ _",

    "@xmath103 are parameters on the @xmath13-straight line support of @xmath101 .",
    "see the figure 4 .",
    "this characterizes the field freedom , the absence of interaction in this time interval between two consecutive interaction events .",
    "the nullity on the rhs of the eq .",
    "( [ lim ] ) is not , of course , valid at an interaction event . in order to have a general expression of everywhere validity a ",
    "covariant derivative \" must replace this derivative ntod _ _ f(x)d__f(x):=__f(x)-a^f_(x)_f(x)0 .",
    "( [ ntod ] ) , that can easily be generalized for non - abelian fields , is a definition of the field @xmath104 as the change in @xmath101 attending the field conservation laws ( energy - momentum , charge , etc . ) .",
    "the product @xmath105 assures that this term is not null only at the interaction point , at the intersection of the straight lines @xmath13 and @xmath106 .",
    "see the figure 4 . -2cm-2.5 cm    1.5cm-.5 cm    7.5 cm",
    "-3.5 cm    the field @xmath104 is  gaugely\"associated to @xmath101 : either its creation is the consequence or its absorption is the cause of a change in @xmath101 ; more than that , actually it is the very change .",
    "this very intuitive picture is not possible without the discrete field concept .",
    "integration on the @xmath13 s replace the discrete fields by their continuum average fields retrieving the standard continuum field formalism .",
    "the effective continuum field @xmath107 , in contradistinction to @xmath108 , changes its amplitude in the course of its propagation , and therefore , the right - hand side of the corresponding equations to ( [ dda ] ) and ( [ lim ] ) are not identically null , as required in the continuum field formalism . a discrete field , according to eq . ( [ dphij ] )",
    ", is just like an instantaneous picture of its source at its retarded time ; a travelling picture .",
    "if @xmath109 is not a point of change in the source s state , the discrete field is not endowed with a physical meaning as its energy tensor is null .",
    "a physical discrete field always corresponds to a sudden change in its source s state at its retarded time .",
    "if there is no change the field is not real , in the sense of having zero energy , zero momentum , zero charge , etc . having no physical attribute it corresponds to the pure  gauge field \" of the continuum formalism .",
    "moreover , eqs .",
    "( [ lim ] ) and ( [ ntod ] ) imply that a gauge field can not be a scalar field except in a strictly unidimensional interaction , with collinear four - vectors @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 of figure 4 .",
    "it excludes the existence of fundamental scalar fields .",
    "in this section we discuss the unavoidable connections between the discrete scalar field and general relativity with its inherent notion of continuous interactions .",
    "that gravity be either totally @xcite or partially @xcite described by a scalar ( continuum ) field is an old idea@xcite .",
    "the exterior ( vacuum ) solutions of general relativity can be generated @xcite from a discrete scalar field in a metric theory but we will see now that this is not possible for solutions with massive sources as they do require a true metric field tensor .",
    "a positive change @xmath113 on the charge @xmath87 of a scalar source means that a scalar field @xmath29 has been , say , absorbed whereas a negative one means then an emission .",
    "therefore , a discrete scalar field carries itself a charge @xmath113 and can , consequently , interact with other charge carriers and be a source or a sink for other discrete scalar fields .",
    "it carries a bit of its very source , a scalar charge ; it is an abelian charged field . on the other hand a new look at equations ( [ psf ] ) and ( [ ac ] ) reveals that @xmath114 describes the energy - momentum content of the field .",
    "so , energy - momentum is the source of a discrete scalar field , whose charge is a scalar function of energy .",
    "energy , of course , is a component of a four - vector and not a lorentz scalar .",
    "its four - vector character comes from the @xmath14 factor in eq .",
    "( [ psf ] ) .",
    "so , @xmath29 is , in some way , associated to the gravitational field since they have a common source .",
    "but , according to general relativity , gravity is a metric field .",
    "it is a measure of the spacetime curvature , of how it deviates from a flat spacetime ; smoothness and continuity are inherent to general relativity . on the other hand , @xmath30 is a discrete ( pointlike ) field ; smooth and continuous is its spacetime average @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , regarding @xmath30 as a point - deformation in a minkowski spacetime , propagating on a null direction @xmath13 , the locally deformed geometry can be described by the following metric tensor gmn g_^f(x)=g_|_f=_- f_f__f(x , ) .",
    "this picture is validated if @xmath115 shows to be a solution of the einstein field equations eeq r_-12g_r = t _ and if its spacetime average , in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) reproduces the corresponding einstein solution @xmath116 . with eqs .",
    "( [ daj ] ) and ( [ gmn ] ) the harmonic coordinate condition @xmath117 is automatically satisfied and the ricci tensor is expressed as rmn r^f_:=r_|_f = f_f_^___f(x ) , which is meaningful , we remind , only in the sense of an approximation of dense set of interaction events .",
    "therefore , the equations ( [ eeq ] ) are reduced to reeq f_f_^___f(x,)=t_|_f .",
    "it is remarkable that the highly non - linear einstein equations are reduced to a linear wave - equation .",
    "this is a consequence of discrete fields and of @xmath118 .",
    "but eq . ( [ reeq ] )",
    "must be identified with eq .",
    "( [ dfe ] ) for the discrete scalar field with t_f^=f^f^_f(x ) , as , from eq .",
    "( [ reeq ] ) , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "there is no problem if @xmath121 describes a massless source .",
    "for example , it can be shown that the vaydia metric can be retrieved from a superposition of the discrete fields of a spherical distribution of massless dust @xcite . for a massive source @xmath121 could be , as discussed in @xcite , a projection of rom t^_m = v^v^_m on the local lightcone , where @xmath75 is a four - velocity and @xmath122 is a pointlike - mass ( a dust grain ) density , but then there would be a problem of consistency .",
    "the point is that @xmath32 carries a little bit of its very source density @xmath52 which can not be @xmath122 , as @xmath32 , being a gravity component , is a massless field . in other words ,",
    "the source of gravity is not the mass but its energy - momentum ; a graviton carries part of the energy - momentum but not of the mass of its source .",
    "this lets explicit a known symmetry of nature : the four fundamental interactions are described by gauge fields having vector currents for sources ( @xmath123 as they are pointlike sources ) , of their respective charges @xmath87 , including gravity since the energy tensor is just a current of its charge , the four - vector momentum .",
    "so , this symmetry is not broken with gravity being a second - rank tensor field and it has further consequences ( see eq .",
    "( [ emc ] ) ) that do not depend on the field tensor nature .",
    "we are not proposing , it is worth repeating , the replacement of general relativity in its domain of validity by a discrete field theory of gravity , and similar statements should be assumed for other field theories . the geometrical description of gravity as the curvature of a pseudo - riemannian spacetime has its validity , in the range of the ratio parameter ( [ ratio ] ) limited by the two critical points , always assured as an absolutely good approximation due to the high density of interaction points in any real measurement .",
    "the point is that in this domain , i.e. for @xmath82 between the two demarcating points , there is , by definition , no experimentally detectable difference between a continuum and a discrete interaction descriptions .",
    "considering the small strength of its coupling the gravitational interaction is irrelevant for physical systems involving relatively few fundamental elements .",
    "even a gravitational aharanov - bohm - like experiment @xcite would require the gravitational field of a macroscopically large object , like the earth .",
    "the sufficient condition for a high density of interaction points is assured and justifies continuous descriptions of gravity , of which general relativity seems to be the best proposal @xcite .",
    "moreover the undetectability of discrete gravity in this region is tantamount to the unobservability of the minkowski spacetime . at this level of approximation",
    "the minkowski spacetime becomes the local tangent space of a curved space - time and @xmath13 a generator of the local hypercone in the tangent space .",
    "this would lead to full general relativity in accordance to a general uniqueness result @xcite that any metric theory with field equations linear in second derivatives of the metric , without higher - order derivatives in the field equations , satisfying the newtonian limit for weak fields and without any prior geometry must be exactly einstein gravity itself .    the eq .",
    "( [ gmn ] ) reminds an old derivation @xcite of the field equations of general relativity by consistent re - iteration of reit g_(x)=_+h(x ) _ , as solution from a gauge invariant wave equation for the field @xmath116 in a minkowski spacetime .",
    "the non - linearity of the einstein s equations comes from contribution to @xmath116 from all terms of higher orders in @xmath124 . for @xmath125",
    "there is no higher order contribution essentially because @xmath118 .",
    "a discrete field has no self - interaction , a consequence of its definition ( [ df ] ) and that is explicitly exhibited in its green s function ( [ pr9 ] ) .",
    "discrete fields are solutions from linear equations . whereas this is true for @xmath126 of eq .",
    "( [ gmn ] ) it is not for its @xmath13-averaged @xmath127 of eq .",
    "( [ reit ] ) .",
    "the non - linearity of general relativity appears here then as a consequence of the averaging process of eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) that effectively smears the discrete field over the lightcone , erasing all the information contained in @xmath13 .",
    "the approach of starting from eq .",
    "( [ reit ] ) for deriving general relativity from flat spacetime receives now the distinctive aspect that the effective riemannian spacetime comes not from a consistency requirement but as an approximation validated by a recognized limitation on our experimental capacity , which can always be improved , be placed on more stringent limits , but never be totally eliminated .",
    "the thesis that all fundamental interactions are discrete is being developed .",
    "if this is the case there is no really compelling reason for excluding gravity from such a unifying idea .",
    "the knowledge of a supposedly true discrete character of all fundamental interactions is a permanent reminder of the limits of a continuum approximative description .",
    "there are many indications of possible theoretical and observational evidences of direct consequences of interaction discreteness , particularly in gravity , of which we can just make some brief comments , although they are full - attention deserving .",
    "discrete interactions imply on the ratio parameter ( [ ratio ] ) whose range is divided in three segments by its two ( the far and the near ) critical values .",
    "the interior segment , between these two values , defines the domain of validity of the continuous - interaction approximation where the polygonal worldline of the sources are so densely packed of interaction points that they can be effectively replaced by smoothly continuous curves where the concept of acceleration and of spacetime curvature at a point on the worldline make sense .    on the other hand , for values of the ratio parameter",
    "( [ ratio ] ) in the exterior segments , i.e. below or above the two critical points the discrepancies between a discrete and a continuous interaction can not be overlooked .",
    "these are the places where great riddles are associated to gravity .",
    "they are not easily fitted with a continuous interaction without evoking new forms of interaction or of ( dark ) matter and energy .",
    "this casts doubts on the results about asymptotical fields and their singularities of any continuum - field theory .",
    "gravity , in contradistinction to all other fundamental interactions has problems in the large distance limits where the field is extremely weak .",
    "the continuum asymptotically null fields are replaced by discrete interactions that become more and more sparse with the distance .",
    "this may be detectable for the gravitational field as it does not have shielding effects although it requires huge masses for detecting very weak gravitational fields and huge distances for producing a detectable @xmath90 ; both conditions found at and above galactic scales .",
    "therefore , a right place for checking for signs and applications of discreteness is on dynamics of galaxies and on cosmology .",
    "flat rotation curve of galaxies , inflation , accelerated expansion may be just manifestation of a discrete gravity .",
    "asymptotic flat rotation curves appear very naturally @xcite in a discrete - field context !",
    "it is therefore a real possibility that the critical point for gravity has already been detected in the flat rotation curves of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the flatness feature of a rotation curve of a galaxy , as remarked by milgrom @xcite , is determined not by its central mass @xmath128 alone nor just by the distance @xmath88 but by the acceleration which is equivalent to the ratio - parameter ( [ ratio ] ) as @xmath79 corresponds to a change of speed .",
    "therefore the existence of the critical point in the continuum / discrete physical description justify the introduction of a new fundamental scale for effective accelerations , and may put milgrom s mond on a sound physical basis .",
    "the actually prevailing wisdom that a flat rotation curves is the ( ad hoc ) indication of some strange , ubiquitous but still to be detected cold dark matter is not free of problems and is far from being unanimous@xcite",
    ".    a gravitational repulsion , instead of attraction may be just a residual correction of the excess committed in the continuum approximation . in a scale of distance where the effective attractive interaction is so weak that sub - dominant contributions to discrete gravity dominate @xcite .",
    "another possible evidence of discrepancy that must be considered is the apparent anomalous , weak , long - range acceleration observed in the pioneer 10/11 , galileu , and ulysses data @xcite . due to their spin - stabilization and to the great distance ( 30 t0 67 au ) from the sun the spacecraft are excellent for dynamical astronomy studies as they permit precise acceleration estimation to the level of @xmath129 the detected anomalous acceleration comes from neglected second largest contribution from those mentioned @xmath65-combinatorials , although it is still not clear if this anomaly is not a too large contributions from discrete interactions .      in the asymptotical short - distance limit , below the critical point , the fact that the discrete field is weaker than the continuum one suggests a natural explanation to inflation in cosmological theories .    other possible indication of discrete physics are the experimentally observed ( or just realized ) manifestations of low ( one- or two- ) dimension physics .",
    "it is an enormous difficulty for the continuum field formalism to explain a mechanism for restricting the interaction field to a one- or two - dimensional space instead of spreading over the whole three - dimensions .",
    "quantum chromodynamics faces similar problems for explaining quark - confinement .",
    "solid state physics is , in a discrete interaction context , a totally unexplored subject , rich of such possible manifestation of discrete physics .",
    "possible examples are the quantum hall effect and the high @xmath0 superconductivity where indications of two - dimensional physics have been observed .",
    "crystal or molecular structural arrangements constraining the movement of the relevant charges to layers ( subdimensional regions ) restrict , as a consequence , the discrete , but not the continuum , interaction fields to these sub - regions . whereas this is easily explained with discrete fields it does not work for the continuum one as it would require ultrarelativistic velocities for an approximate ( but in the wrong space direction ) dimensional reduction of the field 3-dimensional support .",
    "this same mechanism explains , in terms of discrete fields , light polarization and the action of a polaroid .",
    "these constraints may be dependent on the conditions of low temperatures with its consequent suppression of some thermal excitations .",
    "since there is no differential equations and neither integrations with discrete interactions , the evolution of any system is done through successive , sudden and discrete finite differences that are just super imposed . between two consecutive interaction",
    "points every pointlike component just moves freely on straight lines .",
    "it is then remarkable that the whole continuum - field physics is reproduced as an effective approximation after a large number of discrete interactions @xcite .",
    "any exact physical statement must be expressed as finite power series of combinatorials of the accumulated number of interaction events .",
    "so the world is surprisingly simpler and our standard vision of it is richer of such idealized , unreachable concepts than we had previously conceded .",
    "a whole paraphernalia of mathematical tools , so useful in physics - differential equations , integrations , differential geometry , topology , just for citing few - and also so many familiar and daily used mathematical functions like sine , exponential , harmonic and coulombian potentials , and circles , ellipse , etc , do not belong to the realm of the physical world ; they are just unreachable limiting concepts as much as an ideal gas and a reversible process .",
    "this is reflected in the tsallis s @xcite generalized one - parameter statistics based on a power - law distribution of probabilities .",
    "it is reduced to boltzmann statistics when its parameter is equal to one .",
    "this parameter is then a measure of how close the system is from its idealized asymptotic state , that rigorously , is reachable only after an infinite number of interactions",
    ". it may be an appropriate statistics for a world made of sets of discretely interacting pointlike objects .",
    "the idea of an essential continuity of any physical interaction allows unlimited speculations that will always go beyond any level of possible experimental verifications which brings then the risk of not being able of distinguishing the reign of possibly experimentally - grounded scientific research from plain philosophical speculation or even just fiction .",
    "regardless the possibility that some of its consequences have already been experimentally detected , a discrete gravitational interaction , even in other range where it is not experimentally detectable , still for a long time to come , may just make sense of existing theories for delimiting their domain of validity as it has historically happened with all new discreteness introduced in the past , like the ideas of molecules , atomic transitions , and quarks , for example .",
