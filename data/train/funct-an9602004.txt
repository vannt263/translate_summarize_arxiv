    "in applications of duality theory for crossed products one often has to know how common constructions such as induction and restriction of representations behave under duality .",
    "thus , after piecemeal results by several authors , echterhoff was led to prove that , for systems involving abelian groups , induction and restriction are dual to one another @xcite .",
    "he later used these results to great effect in his analysis of crossed products with continuous trace @xcite .    to state echterhoff s theorem precisely , we fix an action @xmath10 of a locally compact abelian group @xmath1 on a @xmath2-algebra @xmath3 , and a closed subgroup @xmath4 of @xmath1 .",
    "green s imprimitivity theorem gives an imprimitivity bimodule @xmath11 implementing a morita equivalence between @xmath12 and the imprimitivity algebra @xmath13 ; the latter algebra is naturally isomorphic to the crossed product @xmath14 by the dual action @xmath15 of the subgroup @xmath16 of @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the map on equivalence classes of representations given by induction of representations in the sense of green : if @xmath19 is a representation of @xmath12 on @xmath20 , then @xmath21 is by definition the natural left action on ( a completion of ) @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath23 denote the map given by restricting a covariant representation @xmath24 of @xmath25 to the representation @xmath26 of @xmath27 . then echterhoff s theorem says that we have commutative diagrams @xmath28 and @xmath29 in which the horizontal arrows on the bottom are the bijections induced by the imprimitivity bimodule @xmath11 .",
    "as it stands , this theorem only makes sense for abelian groups , because otherwise there is no dual action .",
    "however , as echterhoff himself observed , this is an obvious case of a theorem about abelian groups which should extend to an arbitrary locally compact group @xmath1 and a closed normal subgroup @xmath4 , replacing dual actions by dual coactions .",
    "( another such theorem is ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.4 ) , which was extended to non - abelian groups in ( * ? ? ? * theorem  4.4 ) . )",
    "this project has been carried through by echterhoff and the first and third authors @xcite , relating induction and restriction for @xmath30 to , respectively , the restriction and induction processes of mansfield @xcite   for crossed products by coactions .    here",
    "we study the dual situation in which we start with a coaction @xmath0 of a locally compact group @xmath1 on @xmath3 .",
    "our main theorems give ( in special cases ) commutative diagrams @xmath31 and @xmath32 similar to   and .",
    "this time , the horizontal arrows are the bijections given by mansfield s morita equivalence of @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "these theorems are potentially very useful , since they reduce questions about mansfield induction and restriction to questions about the much more familiar and manageable theory of green @xcite . indeed , in the special case @xmath35 , diagrams  and   reduce to results used by gootman and lazar @xcite  to study induced ideals and the primitive ideal space of crossed products by coactions .",
    "we begin with a preliminary section in which we discuss our conventions about hilbert modules , basic facts about induction of representations , and a version of green s imprimitivity theorem for reduced crossed products .",
    "this is necessary because we want to avoid unnecessary assumptions of amenability ; for the same reason , we shall use the version of mansfield induction given in @xcite .",
    "we stress , however , that for amenable groups , the only part of @xcite  needed here is the extension of mansfield s theorem to full coactions and twisted systems .",
    "a special case of this extension is in @xcite , and the general case is hinted at in @xcite .",
    "our first main results in section  [ res - ind - sec ]   concern the `` @xmath36-@xmath37 '' diagram .",
    "the result is more general than that stated above in three respects .",
    "first , we consider two normal subgroups @xmath38 .",
    "second , we consider also the twisted crossed products of @xcite , which introduces another normal subgroup @xmath39 containing @xmath40 ; our strategy , both here and in section  [ ind - res - sec ] , is to prove the untwisted version , and then check that the constructions respect the twists .",
    "third , we prove that the diagram commutes in a very strong sense : all the maps in the diagram are implemented by hilbert modules , so their compositions are given by tensor products of modules , and we prove that the tensor products corresponding to the two alternative routes are naturally isomorphic .",
    "this not only gives a stronger theorem than the corresponding result of @xcite , but also a distinctly shorter proof .",
    "thus we can claim that this is another example of a theorem about abelian groups which becomes much cleaner when seen from the point of view of coactions .",
    "( well , we would , would nt we . )    in section  [ ind - res - sec ]  we turn to the `` @xmath37-@xmath36 '' diagram . as in section  [ res - ind - sec ] , our main results are much more general than stated above .",
    "the overall pattern of this section is like that of section  [ res - ind - sec ] , but this time passing to twisted crossed products is harder . in echterhoff",
    "s paper , the second diagram amounts to the induction in stages of green @xcite .",
    "mansfield did not prove such a theorem for his induction process , so we are forced to do it here ( corollary  [ mansfield - stages - thm ] ) .    in section  [ me - infl - stab - sec ]",
    "we give some applications of our theorems .",
    "we prove that restriction and induction are compatible with morita equivalence in general , and in particular with the stabilization trick of @xcite , which allows us to replace twisted crossed products by ordinary ones .",
    "( this result for abelian groups was a fundamental tool in @xcite . ) along the way we deduce , from the corresponding properties of @xmath37 and @xmath36 for crossed products by actions , that both @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respected by morita equivalence of coactions .",
    "we feel that this is a good illustration of how our results might be used to deduce information about coactions from known properties of actions .",
    "finally , in the last section , we use our main theorems to study the maps @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 on ideals of crossed products by coactions , obtaining generalizations to the case of nonamenable @xmath1 of many of the results in @xcite . here",
    "we see the power not only of @xmath36-@xmath37 ( and @xmath42-@xmath41 ) duality , but also that of the hilbert module techniques , since our maps on spaces of representations automatically give rise , via the rieffel correspondence , to maps on spaces of ideals .",
    "this research was carried out while the second author was visiting the university of newcastle in 1994 and 1995 , and while the first author was visiting arizona state university in 1995 .",
