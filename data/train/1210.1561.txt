    "the success of effective field theories for studying physical systems comes from the fact that they allow to capture in a single picture the universal long distance ( low energy ) properties of models that are instead intrinsically different at much shorter scales .",
    "since cosmological problems are often characterized by well separated scales , the language of effective field theories provides a powerful tool for the study of cosmological evolution , in particular inflationary and dark energy dynamics .",
    "most of the works on cosmological evolution that are based on effective theories can be broadly classified in two different categories , depending on whether they aim to describe the full ( effective ) action @xcite or , conversely , focus on the dynamics of the perturbations around some background @xcite .",
    "the formalism we develop in this work pertains to the former class but , as we will see , gives a general and straightforward effective expansion for cosmological fluid perturbations on a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric ( and may also be extended to other backgrounds ) .",
    "there has recently been a renewed interest in the understanding of fluid dynamics from an effective field theory point of view @xcite .",
    "this general approach is based on the identification of the relevant long - distance degrees of freedom and their symmetries , possibly including spacetime symmetries such as galileo , poincar , or diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "the dynamics is organized in a systematic derivative expansion that makes the theory predictive at low energies .",
    "this formalism ( or variations of it ) has already been applied to describe some aspects of perfect fluids and superfluids @xcite . however , although fluids are ubiquitous in cosmology , the cosmological applications of this framework have been , to the best of our knowledge , largely neglected . in this work",
    "we describe the basic set - up for perfect fluids , adopting the general principles of effective field theory to describe long - distance relativistic dynamics in cosmology and their interplay with metric perturbations .    neglecting chemical potentials",
    ", we consider perfect ( dissipationless ) fluids that carry no conserved charge .",
    "we thus focus on _ minimal _ fluids that involve only three degrees of freedom associated with the position in space of a fluid element .",
    "these degrees of freedom can be identified with comoving coordinates and , as we will see , the symmetries of the fluid determine the operators that appear in the action . in particular , perfect fluids are invariant under internal spatial diffeomorphisms that preserve the volume . as a result",
    ", the relativistic dynamics is fully described at lowest order in derivatives by a single operator . by construction ,",
    "these fluids support both longitudinal ( compressional ) and transverse ( vortices ) excitations , each with its own dynamics .",
    "we discuss perturbation theory for a fluid with an arbitrary equation of state , and describe the coupling to scalar , vector and tensor metric perturbations .",
    "vector metric perturbations mix with vortices , while adiabatic perturbations correspond to the compressional modes of the fluid .",
    "our formalism can cover and extends other frameworks ( e.g. @xmath6 theories , where the dynamics of fluid vortices is instead absent ) .",
    "following the formulation developed in @xcite , which can be connected to earlier works @xcite , we extend the effective theory of perfect fluids to generic metric backgrounds in section  [ effective ] .",
    "we then focus on the flrw case in section  [ flrw ] , and move on to discuss matter and metric perturbations in sections  [ perturb1 ] and [ metricp ] .",
    "adiabatic perturbations are introduced in section  [ genad ] ; and the conclusions and future work directions are presented in [ conclusions ] . in the appendix [ appa ] we review perfect fluids in the context of relativistic hydrodynamics . in the appendix  [ appeulerlagrange ] we comment on the relation between eulerian and lagrangian formulations for fluids , which we both use through the text .",
    "we discuss vorticity conservation using adm variables @xcite in appendix [ vorticitymetric ] .",
    "in this section we will closely follow the formulation of perfect fluids of @xcite which recasts in the modern language of the effective field theories some earlier results of the pull - back approach @xcite which is based on the action formalism pioneered in @xcite .",
    "a perfect fluid is described by a functional of three spacetime scalar functions @xmath7 with @xmath8 , that define , at any time , an isomorphism between the three - dimensional coordinate space of an observer @xmath9 and a continuum of points @xmath10 ( the fluid ) @xcite .",

    ", the isomorphism can be chosen such that @xmath18 .    since",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are isomorphic to @xmath19 , there is always a change of spacetime coordinates @xmath20 such that @xmath21 so that @xmath11 can be naturally interpreted as the comoving coordinates of the fluid .",
    "this means that their variation along the fluid four - velocity @xmath22 ( being @xmath23 the proper time ) is zero @xmath24 as we will see next , these two conditions characterize completely the fluid four - velocity , once the symmetry properties of the system have been chosen .",
    "indeed , the whole structure of the effective theory is fully determined by the symmetries of the fluid .",
    "since the fluid must be homogeneous and isotropic , the internal coordinates have to satisfy the symmetries @xmath25 where @xmath26 and the matrix of elements @xmath27 are constant in space and time . in a homogeneous and isotropic model of the universe , even though the background solution @xmath28 , which represents the ground state of the system , spontaneously breaks spatial translations and rotations , the diagonal combination of internal ( acting on @xmath13 ) and space ( acting on @xmath17 ) symmetries is left unbroken @xcite .",
    "these diagonal symmetries ensure that the perturbations ( or in other words , the excitations of the fluid ) @xmath29 propagate in a homogeneous and isotropic background .",
    "in addition , we demand invariance under volume preserving spatial diffeomorphisms @xmath30 that distinguish a perfect fluid from a gel ( or jelly ) , which is a homogeneous and isotropic solid @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the spatial volume preserving diffeomorphisms ( [ diffs ] ) include the symmetry transformations ( [ homogeneity ] ) and ( [ isotropy ] ) , but we have highlighted the latter two because of their clear geometrical meaning .",
    "the low energy effective theory for a perfect fluid is given by a lagrangian @xmath31 organized in a derivative expansion .",
    "since the dynamics is invariant under spacetime diffeomorphisms and the transformations ( [ homogeneity ] ) , ( [ isotropy ] ) and ( [ diffs ] ) , the lowest order lagrangian must be a function of the determinant of the matrix @xmath32 , whose elements are given by @xcite @xmath33 the effective action that describes the low energy dynamics of the fluid is then @xmath34=\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g}\\,\\mathcal{l}_m \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the lagrangian ( density ) is a function of the determinant of @xmath32 @xmath35 that encodes the long distance properties of the fluid .",

    "otherwise , the low energy lagrangian would start at the next order in derivatives : @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an arbitrary function of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "however , this term can be recast into a higher derivative term by a field redefinition @xcite . in the following",

    "the poisson equation reads : @xmath224 where we sum over all fluid species and @xmath225 is the standard notation for the divergence of the velocity perturbation @xmath226 @xcite , as given in ( [ vgen ] ) : @xmath227 since for a perfect fluid , @xmath228 is given by ( [ mattmet ] ) , it turns out that the right - hand side of ( [ psnf ] ) contains a contribution that depends on the spatial metric perturbation @xmath211 .",
    "hence the expression ( [ psnf ] ) becomes a partial differential equation for @xmath211 with second and fourth order derivatives .",
    "we will use such a form of the poisson equation in section [ genad ] when discussing adiabatic perturbations , see equation  ( [ adiab3 ] ) .    before moving to the description of adiabatic modes ,",
    "it is interesting and useful to see how the equations of motion and ( [ eomtransverse2 ] ) and ( [ elongnew ] ) are related to the standard continuity and euler equations for generic fluids that have the following general form in the conformal newtonian gauge @xcite : @xmath229 notice that for these fluids , i.e. described by ( [ lagrangian ] ) , the euler equation ( [ euler ] ) with @xmath230 is precisely the divergence of ( [ elongnew ] ) , while the continuity equation ( [ continuity ] ) is just an identity .",
    "this follows from the fact that the velocity perturbations @xmath225 in ( [ theta ] ) are the time derivative of the longitudinal modes @xmath231 rather than independent variables .",
    "we have derived the equations of motion ( [ eomtransverse2 ] ) and ( [ elongnew ] ) for an ensemble of @xmath167 non - interacting fluids , each with its own @xmath232 field , assuming only scalar metric perturbations . however , since @xmath233 can be written for each fluid as the curl of a vector potential , we can expect its dynamics to be affected by metric vector perturbations .",
    "for the longitudinal component @xmath175 this can not occur because it has zero curl and hence it can be expressed as the gradient of a single scalar degree of freedom , which then couples only to @xmath211 and @xmath221 as we have already seen .",
    "the perturbed flrw metric in the poisson gauge @xcite generalizes the conformal newtonian gauge ( [ conformal ] ) to include vector and tensor degrees of freedom : @xmath234dx^idx^j\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath235 and @xmath236 are respectively pure vector and tensor perturbations that satisfy @xmath237 applying ( [ contains ] ) to the full set of metric perturbations ( transverse ) @xmath235 vector and ( transverse and traceless ) @xmath236 tensor metric degrees of freedom we find @xmath238\\\\ = & -a^4(\\bar\\rho+\\bar p)\\left[(\\psi+3c_s^2\\phi)\\,\\partial_i \\pi^i_l + \\dot{\\pi}^i_t \\nu^i\\right]+\\mbox{(total derivative)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where tensor perturbations do not appear because of the tracelessness condition .",
    "this confirms the known result that tensor metric perturbations do not couple , at the lowest order in perturbation theory , to perfect fluids . on the other hand , the transverse modes ( vortices ) mix with the vector metric perturbations",
    "the equations ( [ eomtransverse2 ] ) get now replaced by a conservation equation of the linear combination @xmath239 @xmath240 where , as before , the index @xmath180 lists the different perfect fluids from 1 to @xmath167 .",
    "this equation is nothing but the conservation of the charges associated with the vorticity , see ( [ qperturb ] ) .",
    "it corresponds also to the separate conservation of the three - momentum for each fluid @xcite : @xmath241 where @xmath242 are the three - momenta of the fluids .",
    "notice that , if the fluids were not perfect , the right - hand side of ( [ mcon ] ) ( or equivalently ( [ vecttrans ] ) ) would have an anisotropic stress source term .",
    "the equation ( [ mcon ] ) tells us that in absence of such a term , the three - momentum decays due to the hubble expansion .",
    "the equation for the evolution of the vector metric perturbations is @xcite @xmath243 consistent with the redshift of the three - momenta at large scales .    for completeness",
    "we include the equation for tensor modes , which in absence of any source of anisotropic stress reads : @xmath244 as it is well known , these modes do not couple to any fluid degree of freedom if there is no anisotropic stress .",
    "adiabatic perturbations correspond to modes associated with equal time shifts .",
    "they are therefore constructed by perturbing any homogeneous ( intensive ) fluid variable @xmath245 in the following way @xmath246 using the same @xmath247 for all @xmath245 , where the subscript @xmath248 lists any intensive variable pertaining to the fluid .",
    "therefore , we say that two intensive fluid variables @xmath249 and @xmath250 are adiabatically related if their perturbations can be constructed from the same time shift @xmath247 . if we focus on the energy density @xmath53 and the pressure @xmath52 of any fluid , at first order in @xmath247 this implies @xmath251 moreover , for several fluids , we have that adiabatic density modes satisfy @xmath252 for any pair of fluids @xmath180 and @xmath253 interacting only through gravity . describing the perturbations as in ( [ lcoord ] )",
    ", we get that the adiabatic mode is nothing but a common longitudinal degree of freedom @xmath254 in other words , the condition of adiabatic modes translates into `` flavour '' ( or species ) independence of the longitudinal modes @xmath255 in the next subsection we show how this result extends to imperfect fluids that have vanishing non - adiabatic pressure perturbations .    for convenience",
    ", we use the curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurfaces , which is defined to be @xcite @xmath256 remarkably , in our case this is just one third of the divergence of @xmath232 @xmath257 and taking its derivative with respect to conformal time , we get the following relation with the divergence of the velocity ( at first order in @xmath143 ) : @xmath258 defining the entropy perturbation between two species in the usual way @xcite @xmath259 we see that for the kind of fluids that we consider , the entropy perturbation among two species is zero if the coordinate perturbations @xmath232 @xmath260 ) of the two fluids differ by at most a divergenceless three - vector .",
    "this is exactly the condition ( [ adbc ] ) for adiabatic modes that we have found before .",
    "let us recall that for more general ( imperfect ) fluids entropy modes may come as well from an intrinsic non - adiabatic pressure perturbation .",
    "the total pressure perturbation of any species can be decomposed as @xmath261 where the second term is the product of the density perturbation and the usual adiabatic speed of sound . for perfect fluids like the ones we have studied in this work , @xmath262 ( the non - adiabatic part of the pressure perturbation )",
    "however , when a fluid has other internal degrees of freedom different from the @xmath13 coordinates for the general form of the energy - momentum tensor in this case . ] , an intrinsic non - adiabatic pressure will typically arise .",
    "nevertheless , there exists an interesting class of imperfect fluids that have vanishing non - adiabatic pressure perturbations .",
    "they fail to be perfect only because they have anisotropic stress @xmath263 @xmath264 that enters in the einstein equations for the scalar potentials @xmath265 at early times , neutrinos fall into this class of fluids : @xmath266 while @xmath267 .    as we are going to see next , in an adiabatic mode , the expressions that occur for the density and velocity perturbations of perfect fluids are also valid at first order in @xmath143 for imperfect fluids of that kind . from the equation ( [ cons ] ) we know that @xmath268 is a species independent ratio for all fluids involved in an adiabatic mode .",
    "since the definition ( [ zbard ] ) can be written as @xmath269 we have that @xmath270 for any two fluids in an adiabatic mode . moreover , if at least one perfect fluid is present , we have , thanks to equation ( [ mattmet ] ) , @xmath271 . for imperfect fluids with vanishing non - adiabatic pressure : @xmath272 where we have used the continuity equation  ( [ continuity ] ) in the last equality .",
    "we thus find that in this case the velocity perturbations are also flavor independent @xmath273 for any two fluids sharing an adiabatic mode .",
    "again , if at least one perfect fluid is present , then @xmath274 is proportional to the time derivative of the longitudinal mode : @xmath275 . effectively , in an adiabatic mode , the energy density and the velocity of an imperfect fluid with adiabatic speed of sound are like those of a perfect fluid .",
    "we now describe adiabatic modes in further depth using the variable @xmath276 introduced in ( [ zeta ] ) .",
    "since adiabatic modes are particularly important for the study of initial conditions in the early universe and at those times the anisotropic stress of neutrinos can not be neglected , we are led to consider the generic situation in which the metric potentials @xmath211 and @xmath221 can be different from each other , even at first order in the equations .",
    "armed with the knowledge of the previous sections , we can write the poisson equation ( [ psnf ] ) in the following way : @xmath277 where we introduce the `` effective mass '' ( squared ) @xmath278 in which the sum extends over all ( perfect and imperfect ) fluids that are present in the system .    according to the euler equation ( [ euler ] ) , for fluids with anisotropic stress but zero non - adiabatic pressure , the divergence of the equation ( [ elongnew ] ) must be replaced by @xmath279 which , together with equations ( [ adiab3 ] ) and ( [ adiab4 ] ) , form a close system for the perturbations . if photons ( which have @xmath150 and @xmath280 ) are present , recalling that for adiabatic modes the equation ( [ adiabmo ] ) holds , we obtain that the equation ( [ elongnewanis ] ) implies @xmath281+\\frac{1}{3}\\nabla^2\\sigma_\\alpha= & 0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these two equations are actually valid only approximately .",
    "the same happens for the condition ( [ adiabmo ] ) , which strictly holds just in the limit of large scales , @xmath282 . at early times ,",
    "when the universe is radiation dominated and the anisotropic stress of neutrinos can not be neglected , the equation ( [ secondeq ] ) implies that @xmath283 .",
    "using the equation ( [ adiab4 ] ) , one would then navely conclude that for an adiabatic mode @xmath284 .",
    "these two last conclusions have to be understood as approximately valid expressions in the limit @xmath282 .",
    "otherwise they would imply trivial solutions for @xmath285 and the difference of the metric potentials @xcite . in the limit of very large wavelengths , the poisson equation ( [ adiab3 ] ) simplifies to @xmath286",
    "if we plug ( [ poissapp ] ) into ( [ secondeq ] ) ( which assumes adiabaticity ) , we obtain @xmath287 , without having made any assumption about @xmath288 .",
    "this means that the approximation @xmath283 that we have found for adiabatic modes is valid at very large scales ( and early times , with the universe being radiation dominated ) .",
    "therefore , as we have anticipated , we conclude that adiabatic modes can only be defined at very large scales and , strictly speaking , there are no exact adiabatic modes .",
    "notice that if the perturbations are regular for very large wavelengths , the poisson equation helps us to write ( [ elongnewanis ] ) in the following way @xmath289 which is a simple equation for @xmath276 where no metric perturbations appear explicitly .",
    "if the condition of regularity at large distances would nt apply , the whole equation ( [ zetafinal ] ) takes an overall extra @xmath290 operator on both sides .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us recall and show that , as it is expected , the curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurfaces @xmath276 coincides with ( minus ) the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath291 in the limit of very large scales .",
    "the definition of @xmath291 is ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath292 where @xmath293 is a scalar potential that gives the longitudinal part of the fluid coordinate velocity , i.e. @xmath294 . taking the laplacian of ( [ comovcp ] ) and using ( [ zeta ] ) we get @xmath295 for perturbations of very large wavelength , we can use ( [ poissapp ] ) to eliminate the time derivative of @xmath276 in ( [ rela ] ) , obtaining @xmath296 assuming again regularity of the fluctuations at very large distances .",
    "we have shown how to obtain the fundamental equations for the cosmological evolution of perfect fluids from symmetries and action principles . although we have chosen to focus our analysis on the case of a flrw metric ( and its perturbations ) in general relativity and non - interacting fluids ,",
    "the method is of ample generality and can be easily applied to other geometries , theories of modified gravity and can be extended to describe systems which do not interact only via gravity .",
    "the formalism presented allows a straightforward description of the dynamics of the expansion both at the background and perturbation level , allowing us e.g. to easily recover standard results of fluid perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the method is based on an effective theory which is an expansion in spacetime derivatives of three scalar fields .",
    "the condition of invariance under spacetime diffeomorphisms and internal volume preserving spatial diffeomorphisms is sufficient to characterize completely the formal structure of the theory . at the lowest order in derivatives ,",
    "the action for perfect fluids is given by just an arbitrary function @xmath135 of a single operator that takes the form of a determinant because of symmetry requirements .",
    "identifying the various thermodynamical quantities , it turns out that @xmath135 is minus the energy density and is a function of the entropy density .",
    "its first and second derivatives are enough to characterize the pressure , the temperature and the speed of sound of the fluid .",
    "higher order derivatives enter in the self - interactions of the perturbations .",
    "different types of fluids can thus be described by adequate choices of the functional dependence of the energy density on the entropy density .",
    "standard cold dark matter and radiation , just to mention two simple important examples , are easily described by specific power functions .",
    "considering the high precision of ongoing ( e.g. @xcite ) and upcoming ( e.g @xcite ) observations , the need for an accurate theoretical understanding of the universe s content is more important than ever . in order to interpret the data appropriately , a framework that describes the cosmological dynamics of the matter ( energy - momentum tensor ) in wide generality",
    "can be a leap forward .",
    "a natural and widely popular approach has been that of using general fluids ( perfect or not ) @xcite in a phenomenological and quite ad - hoc fashion to fit different types of data . as an important example , many of the studies that try to determine the properties of dark energy are based on the choice of a fluid with a ( possibly time - varying ) equation of state close to @xmath297 and some model dependent assumptions for its perturbation properties .",
    "conversely , the flexibility of the formalism presented here can be relevant for model comparison and parameter estimation since the physical properties of a perfect fluid are encoded in a single function that defines the action . instead of the common phenomenological approach of fitting several parameters like relative densities , equations of state and speed of sounds of an ensemble of fluids , one could directly work with the functions @xmath135 s that define the fluids .",
    "therefore , we think that the framework presented in this paper can provide a first step towards a different useful approach in which the search is focused on functions @xmath135 that fully describe the energy momentum tensor .",
    "the interaction terms between matter ( at any order ) and metric ( at first order ) perturbations can be easily extracted from the gravitational energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this is the case for scalar modes but also for vector and tensor ones , see equations ( [ mixact ] ) and ( [ allperturbations ] ) .",
    "the knowledge of the function @xmath135 and its first two derivatives is enough to describe perfect fluids at first order in perturbations around the background solutions .",
    "higher derivatives of @xmath135 will appear at the next orders in matter perturbations , which can be easily incorporated by using the simple structure of ( [ mixact ] ) and ( [ allperturbations ] ) .",
    "the longitudinal ( compressional ) modes are found to be intimately related to the adiabatic modes at early times , @xmath298 , while the goldstone boson @xmath247 of the associated time shifts contains a piece that depends on the metric perturbations , @xmath299 .",
    "we have shown that the equations that govern the evolution of adiabatic modes ( [ firsteq])-([zetafinal ] ) remain true even for non - perfect fluids which have vanishing non - adiabatic pressure ( such as neutrinos at early times ) provided that at least one fluid species , e.g. photons , can be described by a perfect fluid .",
    "transverse modes ( vortices ) mix with the vector metric perturbations and evolve accordingly to the dilution of vorticity under hubble expansion .",
    "there are several directions that are worth exploring in further depth . among these",
    ", we find particularly interesting the possibility of adding more symmetry such that the system is more constrained and predictive .",
    "conversely , demanding less restrictive symmetries would allow to draw more general conclusions .",
    "below we discuss two such examples that are relevant for almost de sitter expansions .",
    "the condition of almost de  sitter expansion , either at early times ( inflation ) or at late times ( dark energy ) , is @xmath91 , that is @xmath300 , see equation ( [ wminus1 ] ) .",
    "it corresponds to the condition that the action is weakly depending on @xmath39 , suggesting the idea of adding extra ( approximate ) symmetries that could suppress @xmath36-type of actions in the derivative expansion is suppressed , then next order terms in the derivative expansion should generically be taken into account . ] .",
    "an example of such a symmetry is provided by internal scale transformations @xmath301 notice that the choice @xmath302 gives an action that is invariant only up to shifting the cosmological constant , @xmath303 .",
    "the dynamics associated with such an action would thus be symmetric under ( [ scaleinvariance ] ) only if @xmath304 or if gravity is switched - off .",
    "other symmetries may also be invoked to sort the desired lagrangian @xmath36 among all possible choices .",

    "such a fluid has indeed vanishing @xmath50 from the conservation of dilation current . notice that the diagonal ( internal and spacetime ) scale transformation @xmath312constant @xmath313 that gives @xmath314 leaves the action invariant when @xmath315 and @xmath36 is a homogeneous function of rank @xmath316 $ ] .",
    "radiation and matter are selected requiring invariance under ( [ diagonalscale ] ) with @xmath317 and @xmath318 respectively .",
    "it is interesting to consider the possibility of reducing the symmetry of the system by demoting the volume - preserving internal diffeomorphisms ( [ diffs ] ) to be an approximate symmetry .",
    "this would correspond to a homogeneous and isotropic solid , i.e. a jelly , with very small transverse speed of sound @xmath319 . for a jelly",
    "the dynamics is still invariant under translations ( [ homogeneity ] ) and rotations ( [ isotropy ] ) and the action depends not only on @xmath39 but also on the traces of @xmath32 and @xmath320 @xmath321 assuming e.g. @xmath322 one generates a @xmath323 speed of sound for the transverse modes @xmath324 .",
