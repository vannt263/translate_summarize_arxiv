    "various lines of evidence ( see  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* for a brief summary ) indicate these periods are orbital in origin and that ongoing mass - transfer from a low - mass , essentially pure - he donor onto a white dwarf ( wd ) accretor is taking place .",
    "thus , am cvn systems form the wd - accreting class of so - called ultracompact binaries : interacting stellar binaries with orbital periods , @xmath0 , below the minimum @xmath0 attainable by h - dominated objects ( @xmath117080 minutes , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at such short @xmath0 ,",
    "the binary evolution is driven by orbital angular momentum losses due to gravity - wave ( gw ) emission .",
    "the am cvn objects represent an extreme end - product of stellar - binary evolution and at least some of them are examples of wd - wd binaries that survived the transition from a detached phase of gw - driven in - spiral to their current state of stable mass - transfer .",
    "there are significant uncertainties concerning aspects of both the prior binary evolution ( most importantly the outcome of common - envelope events ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the outcomes of wd - wd binaries initiating mass transfer .",
    "the characteristics of the am cvn population can thus provide insights into the physics important to both these phases of their prior evolution .",
    "it is expected that space - based gw interferometers , such as the proposed _",
    "lisa _ mission , will detect essentially the entire galactic population of am cvns with @xmath12 minutes @xcite , providing an observational picture of unprecedented detail .",
    "future prospects for strong constraints from the am cvn population on our theories of binary formation and evolution are , thus , very bright .",
    "in the meantime , advances from electromagnetic observations and developing theory will begin addressing these same questions .",
    "there have been three distinct binary evolution channels proposed to form am cvn systems .",
    "two of these formation channels involve a series of two common - envelope ( ce ) events which bring the remnant cores of a main - sequence ( ms ) binary close enough for gw - emission to drive them into contact , initiating the am cvn phase .",
    "these channels are distinguished by the state of the proto - donor prior to contact @xcite . in what we ll call the he - star channel",
    ", the proto - donor is able to ignite he prior to contact . in the other , which we ll refer to as the wd channel",
    ", the donor is partially - to - very degenerate @xcite and has not undergone any he burning .",
    "the third channel involves an evolved ms star with a wd companion starting stable mass transfer just before it evolves up the red - giant branch @xcite .",
    "the star s core is dominated by he , allowing the binary to evolve to ultracompact configurations .",
    "we ll refer to this third channel as the evolved - ms channel .    in mass transferring binaries , the donor s structural response to mass loss plays a central role in determining the binary s evolution ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the extent to which the donors from each formation channel have been modelled varies considerably .",
    "he - star channel donors have only been modelled by a fit @xcite to a single relevant binary evolution calculation by @xcite .",
    "the wd channel donors have been considered more extensively .",
    "@xcite modelled these donors as fully - degenerate wds obeying the zero - temperature he wd mass - radius ( @xmath13-@xmath14 ) relation .",
    "later , @xcite , using donor structural models developed for ultracompact low - mass x - ray binaries @xcite , modelled the evolution of non - zero entropy donors from the wd - channel .",
    "@xcite has presented a detailed study of the evolved - ms star channel .    in this paper , we focus on the wd channel systems .",
    "the @xcite study had several limitations : they assumed the donors to be fully convective and to evolve adiabatically under mass loss due to the very large mass transfer rates , @xmath15 , produced in am cvns . with these assumptions ,",
    "the evolution is completely determined by the total mass of the two components and the donor s specific entropy , which determines the @xmath13-@xmath14 relation the donor follows and , amongst other system parameters , the binary s @xmath16 evolution .",
    "the inclusion of non - zero entropy donors in this population resulted in shifting systems to larger @xmath15 at fixed @xmath0 and allowed systems to evolve out to longer @xmath0 as compared to a population of zero - temperature donors .",
    "this provided an observational diagnostic of an am cvn system s initial conditions .",
    "the @xcite calculation also indicated that wd channel systems with hot donors and he - star channel systems would not be distinguishable based on @xmath15 determinations alone .",
    "since the entropy structure of the donor determines its response to mass loss ( see the discussion in  [ sec : donorev_prer2min ] and appendix [ app : r_response ] ) , assuming a fully convective structure will overestimate the binary s @xmath0 evolution rate if the donor s true structure in not adiabatic .",
    "further , while assuming the donor responds adiabatically to mass - loss is certainly valid at early stages of the am cvn phase when @xmath15 is very large , this assumption may break down as the binary evolves outward in @xmath0 to lower @xmath15 .    to rectify these shortcomings and",
    "provide predictions for the donor s luminosity and effective temperature , we undertook a study to model the donors within the context of a full stellar structural calculation coupled to the evolution of the am cvn binary .",
    "in particular , we sought to determine the donor s observational signatures as a function of initial system parameters and @xmath0 , as well as to determine how a complete treatment of the donor s structure alters the conclusions of earlier studies .",
    "we also sought to model accurately the critical phase of mass transfer turn - on , when the donor is coming into contact and a transition in the @xmath0-evolution from gw - dominated in - spiral to the mass - transfer dominated expansion occurs .",
    "this phase of wd channel system evolution has not been modelled in any detail prior to this study .",
    "to carry out the computations , we developed a new stellar evolution code to perform the coupled donor / binary calculations .",
    "a brief description of this code , detailing our numerical modelling of the donor and binary is provided in  [ sec : calcdetails ] . in  [",
    "sec : initial_models ] , we describe the procedure for determining the range of initial donor degeneracy and donor structural models used for our am cvn phase calculations .",
    "we present the results of our calculations in  [ sec : ev_general ] and discuss these results and several of their applications in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , we summarize in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "to achieve a necessary level of flexibility in terms of input physics and defining system of equations for this and related projects , we implemented a stellar evolution code capable of handling most 1d stellar evolution calculations expressed as boundary - value problems .",
    "this code is written in c++ and is comprised of a suite of abstract classes defining the necessary components of a stellar evolution calculation . at its core is a generalized 1d relaxation - method boundary - value problem ( bvp ) solver ( see , e.g ,  17.3 of * ? ? ?",

    "as shown in @xcite , evolution during the post - contact am cvn phase is strongly influenced by the state of the donor at contact . in this section ,",
    "we determine a set of initial donor models that encompass the range of donor properties at contact produced in wd channel am cvn systems and discuss the expected distribution of these properties based on the population synthesis calculation of @xcite .      to determine the range of parameters our initial donor models should cover , we utilize data from the @xcite population synthesis model and the methodology of @xcite .",

    "* ) predicts post - ce conditions where _ the donor is already in roche contact_. this is due to some systems having sufficiently hot proto - donors with @xmath50 significantly greater than the zero - temperature configuration . it is unclear whether such systems will cleanly exit the ce or simply be driven to a prompt merger .",
    "a realistic determination of this question is beyond the scope of this paper . instead , in order to examine how this issue could influence the distribution of donor contact parameters , we considered two different , _ rough _ criteria for determining which systems survive the ce .",
    "in one , we removed all such systems from the population . in the second , we looked at the evolution of @xmath50 ( based on the _ isolated _ he wd structures ) and @xmath66 to determine if @xmath94 was ever satisfied before the system was driven to @xmath95 due to gw emission .",
    "this could happen if the proto - donor is able to contract more rapidly than gw emission decreases @xmath66 .",

    "more importantly , the range of @xmath93 in the overall population is not affected by these border line systems , since donors with @xmath100 exhibit the full range of @xmath93 and these more massive donors all appear to exit the ce cleanly .",
    "this general conclusion also applies to concerns about donors with @xmath101 .",
    "the progenitors of these donors will not have developed a distinct core / envelope structure at the start of the ce , making it unlikely that they will survive the ce - event @xcite .",

    "this however may not be a significant issue given the source s variability .",
    "we also considered a model with accretor and donor contributions , but no disk .",
    "both components were modelled as single @xmath5 blackbodies . the observed spectra is well fit by the combination of a @xmath394 k accretor and a @xmath395 k donor at a distance of 293 pc ( upper panel of figure [ fig : j0926_spectra ] ) .",
    "the accretor s @xmath5 is a little below the range predicted by the @xcite theory (  [ sec : discussion_hot_donors ] ) , while the donor s @xmath5 is consistent with an @xmath254 somewhat below 0.5 .",
    "the fit in this case is somewhat better than the accretor+disk model .",
    "we should note that other acceptable fits can be found by collectively increasing or decreasing both components temperatures and the system s distance .",
    "thus , higher accretor @xmath5 require higher @xmath254 values for the donor to be hot enough to produce a good fit to the spectra .",
    "a parallax measurement for sdss j0926 + 3624 will clearly distinguish between the stable @xmath376-disk+accretor and the accretor+donor model ( as well as further constrain the component temperatures in this latter model ) . the better agreement between data and donor+accretor model and our expectation that the disk is not in a stable high - state already argues for the donor+accretor model .",
    "given our poor understanding of a low - state disk spectra and flux , however , one can only conclude that an accretor+donor model is fully consistent with both the observed spectrum and all theoretical expectations for sdss j0926 + 3624 .",
    "since this model does nt include any disk contributions , it does fail to explain the inferred disk properties of the @xcite results .",
    "it may be possible that it is a cool disk providing the long-@xmath396 flux in this system , possibly explaining both the sloan spectrum and the @xcite results .",
    "better understanding of quiescent he disks and phase - resolved spectral studies of this system may both be required to break this degeneracy between either a cold disk or donor as the source of long wavelength flux .",
    "we have implemented a new stellar evolution code in c++ that allows significant flexibility in use of input physics and defining systems of odes .",
    "this code has been used to model , for the first time , the full stellar structure of the donors in wd - channel am cvn binaries .",
    "specifically , the thermal and structural evolution of the donor has been calculated to determine how the donor s thermal evolution affects the evolution of the binary and to provide the first predictions for the donor s light in these systems .",
    "systems forming through the wd channel are expected to have a range of donor properties , most importantly a range of initial ( i.e. , at contact ) degeneracy @xcite .",
    "we modelled the pre - contact evolution of wd channel systems based on the @xcite population synthesis to determine suitable initial donor models for our subsequent calculations .",
    "the donors in this population have initial central degeneracy parameters between @xmath39710-@xmath81 , with the distribution in @xmath93 being rather flat between @xmath39725 - 4000 .",
    "most of these systems make contact at @xmath2362 - 11 minutes .",
    "this range of donor parameters is likely dependent on assumptions about the binary evolution leading to their formation ( in particular the ce - event prior to the am cvn phase ) and our assumptions about the donor s cooling during the pre - contact phase .",
    "quantifying the potential effects of these assumptions will require more extensive modelling of the proto - donors in this pre - contact phase .",
    "our evolutionary calculations show that wd - channel am cvn systems have three phases of evolution .",
    "an @xmath15 turn - on phase , during which @xmath15 grows to its maximum value while @xmath50 contracts under mass loss , and @xmath0 decreases .",
    "this behaviour produces a turn - on phase lasting significantly longer than previous estimates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath2-@xmath3 yrs depending on the donor s initial @xmath93 . in the second phase , the donor expands adiabatically under mass loss .",
    "the third phase begins once the mass loss rate and the donor s thermal time have have both decreased enough to allow , starting at @xmath398 minutes , the donor to cool and contract to a fully degenerate configuration .",
    "we discussed how the system s initial conditions influence the later evolution of @xmath220 and @xmath16 .",
    "we also revised the upper limit to the @xmath399 relation for wd - channel systems ( given our initial condition determinations ) .",
    "finally , we predicted the donor s intrinsic @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; during the adiabatic phase , @xmath23110@xmath23210@xmath233 @xmath234 , while @xmath40010001800 k.    the flux generated by the accretion flow in these systems can easily dominate the donor s intrinsic thermal output .",
    "we self - consistently modelled the impact of the accretion light on the donor s and binary s evolution in the grey approximation .",
    "the irradiation reduces the donor s intrinsic @xmath4 , producing a delay in the onset of cooling and slowing the donor s contraction once cooling does begin .",
    "this shifts the downturn in the @xmath16 relation seen in the non - irradiated donors to longer @xmath0 .",
    "irradiation also elevates the donor s photospheric temperature and surface luminosity ( up to 10,000 k and @xmath401 , respectively , during the adiabatic phase ) .",
    "the observational signatures of irradiation depend on the irradiating flux s spectra , the opacity sources in the donors atmosphere and the efficiency of day - to - night side energy flow , all considerations beyond this work s scope .",
    "our predictions for the irradiated donor s light are thus approximate and valid in the limit of complete redistribution of flux in a grey atmosphere with a bond albedo of zero .",
    "in comparison to prior predictions using simpler donor models , we find that previous assumptions of fully - convective donors and adiabatic evolution @xcite are not valid over much of the am cvn evolution .",
    "the donors only become fully convective at @xmath305 minutes and @xmath402 . prior to this",
    ", their shallower entropy profile leads to a slower expansion rate relative to fully convective models . due to this",
    ", we argue that prior to the onset of cooling , @xmath15 measurements could distinguish between systems formed in the he - star versus wd channels ( as opposed to the conclusions of * ? ? ?",
    ". after the cooling phase develops , all initial donor entropy information , including any that distinguishes formation channels , will be erased .",
    "a system s evolution about its @xmath0-minimum and the occurrence of donor cooling phase both leave diagnostic signatures on the am cvn population s @xmath0-distribution .",
    "most significantly , the evolution of @xmath339 at the @xmath0-minimum and the slowing of @xmath0 evolution that occurs during the cooling phase lead to peaks in the @xmath0-distribution whose location and size depend on initial parameters ( and @xmath254 in the case of the cooling peaks ) .",
    "these could provide observational diagnostics of the distribution of these parameters in the galactic am cvn population .",
    "finally , we showed that recent measurements of @xmath60 and @xmath49 in the eclipsing am cvn system , sdss j0926 + 3624 @xcite provide direct evidence that wd - channel systems contribute to the am cvn population and that this channel produces non - zero entropy donors as predicted by @xcite .",
    "we compared predictions for this system s light based on our models , showing that a composite spectrum consisting of donor and accretor contributions is fully consistent with this system s discovery spectra .",
    "based on this , we predict this system lies at a distance of @xmath403 pc .",
    "current investigations include applying this theory to interpret the improving observational constraints in many of the known am cvn systems ( e.g. , roelofs et al .",
    "2007 , submitted ) .",
    "in addition , we are considering how the physics relevant to the am cvn system formation and early contact - phase survival could be probed by future _ lisa _ observations of the @xmath0-distribution of sources at @xmath404 minutes .",
    "other indicated work includes proper non - grey , phase dependent modelling of the donor s irradiated atmosphere as well as progress on understanding the contribution of low - state he accretion disks to the system s emission .",

    "we thank susana barros , gijs roelofs , tom marsh , gijs nelemans , bart willems , and dean townsley for helpful discussions and encouragement during the preparation of this manuscript , as well as jason alexander for providing the low - temperature opacity tables needed in this work and for answering associated questions . for material support ,",
