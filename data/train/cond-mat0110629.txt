    "transport properties of electron systems strongly depend on dimensionality . in one dimension",
    "the coulomb interaction between carriers modifies the ground state and dramatically changes the transport properties . in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) metal , instead of a fermi liquid of electrons , a so - called luttinger liquid ( ll )",
    "is developed  @xcite .",
    "elementary excitations in a ll are collective charge and spin boson modes , rather than fermion quasiparticles as in 3d metals .",
    "the ground state of a ll is characterized by a power - law suppression of the tunneling density of states .",
    "impurities in a ll act as tunneling barriers .",
    "therefore , the conduction @xmath1 of impure lls is a power - law function of temperature , @xmath2 , and voltage , @xmath3  ( @xmath4 in current - voltage curves )  @xcite .",
    "these dependencies are considered as a fingerprint of 1d behavior .",
    "the experimental study of 1d effects in long nanowires remains a challenge .",
    "the main efforts are focused on developing a technology to fabricate metal or semiconductor quantum wires with transverse sizes on the order of 10 nm or less and attaching them to an external circuit . at the present ,",
    "both problems were successfully solved for a number of physical systems including single - wall carbon nanotubes  @xcite , mo@xmath5o@xmath5 molecular wires  @xcite , si whiskers  @xcite , insb nanowires in asbestos matrices  @xcite , bi nanowires in various matrixes ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , _ etc_. experimental observation of the power - law - supporting ll theories has been reported for single - wall carbon nanotubes  @xcite , mo@xmath5o@xmath5 nanowires  @xcite and insb nanowires  @xcite . in all cases the nanowire diameters",
    "do not exceed 10 nm .",
    "there is a wide class of materials suitable for experimental search and study of 1d effects : quasi - one dimensional ( quasi-1d ) conductors with a charge - density wave ( cdw ) ground state  @xcite . such materials consist of metallic chains connected in a crystal through the relatively weak van der waals interaction . at temperatures below the peierls transition temperature , @xmath6",
    ", the peierls instability leads to the development of the cdw , which is a 3d - ordered periodic modulation of the electron density accompanied by a periodic distortion of the crystalline lattice .",
    "an example of these materials is nbse@xmath0 .",
    "it has a monoclinic unit cell with lattice parameters @xmath7   , @xmath8   , @xmath9   , and @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the conducting chains are along the @xmath11 direction .",
    "nbse@xmath0 exhibits two peierls transitions leading to the partial dielectrization of the electron spectrum , at @xmath12  k and @xmath13  k. the remaining non - condensed electrons provide metallic conduction down to the lowest temperatures .    in some sense",
    ", the cdw state results from an instability of lls with respect to 3d coupling at low enough temperatures .",
    "it is also widely accepted that in quasi-1d conductors ll exists at temperatures above @xmath14 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "as @xmath6 decreases with the sample cross - section area  @xcite , one could expect the area of existence of ll to grow towards the low - temperature region for sufficiently thin crystals .",
    "transitions from quasi-1d to 1d behavior with reduction of the transverse sample sizes has recently been observed in the quasi-1d conductors nbse@xmath0 and tas@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "here we present the results of our observation of even more dramatic changes in the conduction of quasi-1d conductors found in two novel ( for quasi-1d conductors ) types of structures : cdw / normal - metal / cdw ( c / n / c ) junctions and nanoconstrictions .",
    "surprisingly , 1d behavior has been observed in samples with transverse sizes in the @xmath15m - range scale .",

    "for this purpose two platinum probes are deposited on top of the crystal surface by fib deposition 40  @xmath15 m apart of each other . at this",
    "stage temperature variations of the sample resistance have been measured to verify its character before junction fabrication .",
    "then a junction is fabricated on some distance @xmath38 outside this 40 @xmath15 m region .",
    "the platinum probes are used as voltage probes in a four - terminal setup .",
    "it has been found that for @xmath39  @xmath15 m the junction fabrication does not affect the sample properties , whereas for @xmath40 and 10  @xmath15 m a rapid increase in resistance is observed when going down in temperature .",
    "these measurements rule out the possibility that the resistance growth is solely an interface phenomena .",
    "it was also found that both etching alone and deposition of platinum on the top of the crystal alone do not dramatically change the cdw properties of crystals as measured by electric transport .",
    "thus , the resistance increase outside the junction region only occurs when the crystal has been etched through and platinum has subsequently been deposited .",
    "our results show that quasi - one dimensional conductors with a cdw can demonstrate the temperature and electric - field dependent conduction expected for 1d systems .",
    "the electric properties of nanoconstrictions in nbse@xmath0 reproduce quantitatively the results obtained for long thin crystals of nbse@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the electric properties of c / n / c junctions reveal qualitatively the same type of behavior , but for much bigger transverse sizes of samples : 1d behavior is observed even in samples with a width of the order of 10  @xmath15 m .    a quasi-1d conductor can be considered as a set of metallic chains with ll coupled by an interchain hopping @xmath41 . at @xmath42",
    "the lls are unstable towards 3d coupling  @xcite , and the 3d ordered cdw may be formed .",
    "reduction of the transverse sizes of quasi-1d conductors decreases the stiffness of the cdw .",
    "this results in growth of dynamic cdw fluctuations . in nbse@xmath0",
    "a growth of fluctuations is noticeable in thin samples with submicrometer transverse sizes  @xcite . at a critical transverse size , when the amplitude of fluctuation of a cdw phase difference between neighboring chains reaches a value of the order of @xmath43 , the stiffness of the shear deformation modes vanishes .",
    "this leads to destruction of the 3d order of the cdw , and the system starts to behave as a set of lls , like it is expected in a sliding ll phase at sufficiently small @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "an additional contribution may come from static cdw disorder .",
    "growth of static cdw fluctuations may result from an increase of the surface contribution , as well as from introduction of defects and impurities . in this case",
    "one can also expect frustration of the formation of a 3d - ordered cdw and recovery of ll properties .",
    "it has been argued that the power laws expected for lls , survive for the sliding ll phase formed in 2d and 3d ordered chains of coupled lls , at least in some range of @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "if the scenario described above is correct , one could expect that the measured temperature dependencies of the linear resistance , as well as i - v curves , can be fitted by ll - like equations . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , for a single - channel ll the temperature set of i - v curves collapses into a master curve described by : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the gamma - function , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the fitting parameters .",
    "one could expect that a similar equation , but with modified @xmath48 and @xmath49 , describes stacks of lls .",
    "[ master ] shows the best fit of the data of fig .",

    "the conduction exponents are @xmath50 for impurity barriers , and @xmath51 for interchain tunneling  @xcite .",
    "both conduction channels are connected in parallel .",
    "the relative contribution of each conduction channel depends also on the strength of impurities , temperature and the electric field . as the resistance along the chains grows faster upon cooling than the resistance across the chains , interchain tunneling dominates at low temperatures .",
    "it is interesting to compare the observed exponents with the predictions of ll theories .",
    "the biggest observed exponent is @xmath52 . in the case of intrachain tunneling",
    "we get 1/g=7 . taking @xmath53  @xcite ,",
    "where @xmath54 denotes the potential energy of electron - electron interaction and @xmath55 is the fermi energy , one gets @xmath56 . as @xmath57  ev in nbse@xmath0  @xcite , the respective @xmath58  ev is too big ( in the case of interchain tunneling , the discrepancy is even more dramatic ) .",
    "similar discrepancies are observed if we use a more accurate way of estimating @xmath59  @xcite . in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite , to get @xmath60 , we need @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the effective wire diameter , and @xmath63 is the fermi wave vector . as @xmath64   , where @xmath65 is the cdw wave vector , the diameter @xmath66   .",
    "such an effective wire diameter is too small .",
    "also for this estimation , an even more serious disagreement arises if we assume interchain tunneling as the dominant mechanism of conduction .",
    "the observed disagreement with predictions of ll theory for a single chain may be caused by a renormalization of exponents by interchain interactions  @xcite .",
    "we would like to note that the cdw - like component of the electron density  @xcite which is expected to be large in our quasi-1d crystals  can increase dielectrization .",
    "additional dielectrization ( especially for c / n / c junctions ) may come from friedel oscillations around impurity sites  @xcite .",
    "further study is necessary to clarify the origin of the observed behavior .",
    "our results show that quasi-1d conductors with a cdw ground state can demonstrate the temperature and electric - field dependent conduction expected for 1d systems . for fib - etched thin crystals we reproduced results obtained earlier on thin un - etched crystals @xcite . for c",
    "/ n / c structures , the ll features are more pronounced : we observed power laws up to 6 orders of magnitude in conduction .",
    "the observed behavior corresponds to the destruction of 3d cdw ordering by fluctuations and the recovery of the luttinger liquid features of metallic chains .",
