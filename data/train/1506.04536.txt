    "the index of the automorphism represented by a train track morphisms @xmath96 with respect to a gate structure @xmath66 depends on the intrinsic gate structure @xmath116 , which may well be strictly finer than @xmath66 .",
    "2 .   a map @xmath240 , which is a train track morphism with respect to two distinct gate structures @xmath66 and @xmath312 , may well be legalizing with respect to @xmath66 but not with respect @xmath312 .",

    "both potential problems are resolved as follows by the application of theorem  [ thm : quote-2 ] :    the train track morphism @xmath69 constructed in section  [ sec : map - iwip - but - inp ] may indeed well have an intrinsic gate structure @xmath314 that is strictly finer than the previously defined gate structure @xmath66 .",
    "however , in lemma  5.9 of  @xcite it has been shown that a train track morphisms @xmath247 with respect to a gate structure @xmath66 which is legalizing ( with respect to @xmath66 ) satisfies indeed @xmath315 .",
    "now , since the composition of any train track morphism with a legalizing train track morphism is again legalizing ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  5.8 ) ) , by the same argument as before we obtain automatically @xmath316 .",
    "we will now discuss some further aspects of the index of free group automorphisms :      handel and mosher  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , question  5 ) ask what values for the _ index deficit _",
    "@xmath317 for any ( iwip ) automorphism @xmath32 are possible , and whether for @xmath318 the maximal index deficit goes to @xmath319 .    from our theorem  [ thm : main ]",
    "it follows directly that for every @xmath320 every value @xmath321 in @xmath322 with @xmath323 is achieved as index deficit for some iwip @xmath24 .",
    "the maximal index deficit is hence equal to @xmath324 , which indeed tends to @xmath319 for @xmath325 .",
    "this result has independently been obtained also by sonya leibman  @xcite .",
    "we now consider in some detail the results of masur and smillie  @xcite , in particular their theorem  2 on p.  291 : the translation of the terminology used there for quadratic differentials and pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms to the usual terminology for free group automorphisms is not completely evident .",
    "we give here a bit of translation help :    in the absence of punctures on the surface @xmath105 , a @xmath326-pronged singularity in  @xcite translates into an isogredience class of automorphisms @xmath26 with @xmath327 . in this case",
    "we would have to translate the genus @xmath247 of @xmath105 , multiplied by 2 , into the rank @xmath272 of the free group , except that without punctures @xmath328 is not free , which explains the summand @xmath329 in the index equality in part ( a ) of theorem  2 of @xcite .",
    "now , the @xmath330 punctures which masur and smillie admit in their theorem  2 appear nowhere explicitly , but in fact they can be essentially anywhere : if a puncture lies outside of the singularities and outside the separatrices raying out from them , then it lies on some regular leaf of the stable foliation , and hence it becomes a `` @xmath73-prong singularity '' , thus contributing a value @xmath331 to the given list .",
    "the automorphisms @xmath26 in the corresponding isogredience class have two attracting fixed points on @xmath16 and @xmath332 , which adds up to @xmath333    if a puncture coincides with a singularity , say with @xmath326 prongs , then , by the analogous reasoning , we obtain @xmath334 .",
    "this explains also why a value @xmath335 , which they admit , does not lead to negative index of the corresponding isogredience class : any singularity with a single prong only must coincide with one of the punctures !",
    "however , in the context of the paper here we have to add a further restriction : a pseudo - anosov surface homeomorphism induces an iwip automorphism if and only if the surface has only one puncture , so that we have in our context always the condition @xmath336 .",
    "we come now to the 4 exceptional cases listed in part  ( c ) of their theorem  2 : the first case @xmath337 can not be realized by a pseudo - anosov map with non - orientable stable foliation , but according to their theorem  2 there must be a realization by a pseudo - anosov with orientable stable lamination .",
    "the last case , @xmath338 requires more than one puncture , so that it is ruled out by the previous paragraph .",
    "the third case , @xmath339 , adds up to @xmath340 , so that for @xmath341 one has @xmath342 : in this case all automorphisms are geometric , and hence there is no chance to realize the corresponding index list @xmath343 $ ] .",
    "however , in the paper here we always assume @xmath41 , so that this case does not occur .",
    "it remains the second exceptional case : @xmath344 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath345 . from @xmath336",
    "we deduce the following two possibilities for the index list : @xmath346 $ ] or @xmath347 $ ] , according to which of the two singularities coincides with the puncture .",
    "the former index list is alternatively realized by the case @xmath348 from  @xcite ( with the puncture at the singularity with only 1 prong ) , which satisfies all conditions of theorem  2 of  @xcite . the other index list , @xmath347 $ ] ,",
    "however , leads always back to their second exceptional case @xmath344 , and hence can not be realized by a geometric automorphism .",
    "it remains as last `` left - over mystery '' of the index realization problem for @xmath41 the question whether the index list @xmath349 $ ] can perhaps be realized by a parageometric automorphism of @xmath350 .",
    "our realization result naturally leads to the question of frequency of the different index lists .",
    "thanks to the program developped by the first author in python and sage we were able to do the following numerical experiments .",
    "fix a finite alphabet @xmath351 with @xmath272 letters and let @xmath352 be the free group on @xmath351 . with convention  [ convention : no - untouched - edges ] , an elementary nielsen automorphism is given by @xmath353 with @xmath354 , @xmath355 and @xmath356 .",
    "recall that elementary nielsen automorphisms form a generating set of @xmath357 and @xmath358 .",

    "computations were made at the math department in marseille , without compiling the sage code nor looking for serious optimization .",

    "different tests with the above data may lead to slightly different results .",
