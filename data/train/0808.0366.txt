    "<S> the photonuclear production of vector mesons in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions is investigated within the collinear approach using different parameterizations for the nuclear gluon distribution . the integrated cross section and the rapidity distribution for the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) process </S>",
    "<S> are computed for energies of rhic and lhc . a comparison with the recent phenix data on coherent production of @xmath2 mesons is also presented . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the study of the exclusive quarkonium photoproduction can be used to constrain the nuclear effects in the gluon distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> a systematic measurement of the nuclear gluon distribution is of fundamental interest in understanding the parton structure of nuclei and to determine the initial conditions of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) predicted to be formed in central heavy ion collisions ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> another important motivation for the determination of the nuclear gluon distribution is that the high density effects expected to occur in the high energy limit of qcd should be manifest in the modification of the gluon dynamics @xcite . at the moment </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of this distribution is completely undetermined by the fixed target experiments , with a possible improvement in the future electron - nucleus colliders ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the date of construction and start of operation of these colliders is still in debate , we need to obtain alternative searches to estimate the medium effects in the nuclear gluon distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it has motivated several authors to propose the study of different observables in distinct processes to constrain the nuclear gluon distribution ( for a recent review see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in particular , in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was proposed to study the vector meson production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc in order to constrain the nuclear medium effects present in the nuclear gluon distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is that in these collisions the high flux of quasi - real photons from one of the nucleus provides a copious source of photoproduced reactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a photon stemming from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding nuclei can penetrate into the other nucleus and interact with one or more of its hadrons , giving rise to photon - nucleus collisions to an energy region hitherto unexplored experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the interaction of quasi - real photons with protons has been studied extensively at the electron - proton collider at hera ( for a recent review see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained @xmath3 center of mass energies extends up to @xmath4 gev , an order of magnitude larger than those reached by fixed target experiments . due to the larger number of photons coming from one of the colliding nuclei in heavy ion collisions , a similar and more detailed study will be possible in these collisions , with @xmath5 reaching 950 gev for the large hadron collider ( lhc ) operating in its heavy ion mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the cross section for the diffractive vector meson production depends ( quadratically ) on the gluon distribution , it gives a unique opportunity to study the low @xmath6 behavior of the gluons inside the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the results from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite demonstrate that the study of photoproduction of vector mesons in ultraperipheral collisions determines the behavior of the nuclear gluon distribution in the full kinematic region , with the rapidity distribution allowing for the first time to estimate the emc , antishadowing and shadowing effects . </S>",
    "<S> however , these results were obtained considering several approximations for the calculations of the diffractive vector meson production , the grv95 parameterization @xcite for the nucleon parton distribution and the eks parameterization @xcite for the nuclear effects . </S>",
    "<S> all these models have been improved recently . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the phenix collaboration recently released the first ( preliminary ) data on the cross section of the coherent @xmath2 production in gold - gold ultraperipheral collisions at @xmath7 gev @xcite , providing the first opportunity to check the basic features and main approximations of the distinct approaches describing nuclear vector meson photoproduction . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in near future the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will start its experimental physics program and coherent hadron - hadron interactions should be studied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these facts motivate a revision of the estimates presented in ref . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in this paper we revise the predictions for @xmath2 production in coherent @xmath8 collisions and present , for the first time , predictions for the @xmath9 production in coherent collisions considering the collinear formalism .    </S>",
    "<S> over the past few years a comprehensive analysis of vector meson production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions was made considering different theoretical approaches @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , much effort has been devoted to obtain signatures of the qcd pomeron in such process @xcite , which can be used to constrain the qcd dynamics at high energies . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we restrict our study of vector meson production to the collinear formalism , based on the qcd factorization theorem @xcite , which predicts that at small-@xmath6 and for a sufficiently hard scale , the cross section of coherent production of vector mesons off any hadronic target , including a nucleus , is proportional to the square of the gluon parton density of the target . </S>",
    "<S> to lowest order , the @xmath10 @xmath11 amplitude can be factorized into the product of the @xmath12 transition @xmath13 , the scattering of the @xmath14 system on the target via ( colorless ) two - gluon exchange , and finally the formation of the quarkonium from the outgoing @xmath14 pair . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , which is in agreement with @xcite . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we assume the same value of @xmath34 for @xmath2 and @xmath9 production . </S>",
    "<S> it is a reasonable approximation , since the hera data shown that @xmath34 decreases to a universal value of about 4 - 5 gev@xmath36 as the scale @xmath37 increases , independently of the vector meson studied ( for a recent review see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we compare our results with the @xmath2 ( left panel ) and @xmath9 ( right panel ) hera data @xcite and demonstrate that it are reasonably described . in the case of @xmath9 production , our prediction is systematically somewhat below the scarce experimental data . in principle , the agreement could be improved by choosing a smaller value of @xmath34 . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we will assume that the corrections for the lo exclusive heavy vector meson production are independent of the target , i.e. we consider that it are the same in the proton and nuclear case . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we assume that in the case of nuclear targets , @xmath34 is dominated by the nuclear size , with @xmath38 and the non - forward differential cross section is dominated by the nuclear form factor , which is the fourier transform of the nuclear density profile . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we consider that the total cross section for vector meson production in @xmath31 interactions is given by @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the nuclear form factor for the distribution . here </S>",
    "<S> we use the analytical approximation of the woods - saxon distribution as a hard sphere , with radius @xmath41 , convoluted with a yukawa potential with range @xmath42 fm . </S>",

    "<S> the main input in the calculations of the quarkonium production cross section in photon - nucleus interactions is the nuclear gluon distribution . in the last years </S>",
    "<S> several groups has proposed parameterizations for the nuclear parton distributions ( npdf ) , which are based on different assumptions and techniques to perform a global fit of different sets of data using the dglap evolution equations @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> let s consider the eks parameterization @xcite which is based on the dglap evolution equations @xcite with adjusted initial parton distributions to describe experimental results @xcite presenting nuclear shadowing effects . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea of this framework is the same as in the global analyzes of parton distributions in the free proton : they determine the nuclear parton densities at a wide range of @xmath6 and @xmath49 gev@xmath47 through their perturbative dglap evolution by using the available experimental data from @xmath50 dis and drell - yan ( dy ) measurements in @xmath51 collisions as constraint . in this approach , </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear effects are taken into account in the initial parton distribution @xmath52 of the dglap evolution . </S>",
    "<S> eks have expressed the results in terms of the nuclear ratios @xmath53 for each parton flavor @xmath54 in a nucleus with @xmath55 nucleons ( @xmath56 ) , at @xmath57 and @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> other groups have considered different sets of data , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the dglap equation and uncertainty estimates , and have proposed distinct approaches to describe the nuclear effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the dglap evolution are taken into account in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , de florian and sassot ( ds ) @xcite proposed a framework where each nuclear parton distribution is described by a convolution of the corresponding free nucleon parton distribution with a simple flavor dependent weight function that takes into account the nuclear effects . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the authors of @xcite have calculated the npdf uncertainties by using the hessian method and have obtained lo @xcite and nlo @xcite nuclear parameterizations . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , an important step toward better constraining the gluon nuclear distributions was done in @xcite , where the authors include recent rhic data from high-@xmath59 hadron production at forward rapidities in d+au collisions , which probe small values of @xmath6 in the gluon distribution of the @xmath60 target , in their global analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the striking result is a much stronger gluon shadowing than in the previous parameterizations . due to the scarce experimental data in the small-@xmath6 region and/or for observables strongly dependent on the nuclear gluon distribution </S>",

    "<S> as we can see , these parameterizations predict very distinct magnitudes for the nuclear effects . for larger values of @xmath6 , the eks and </S>",
    "<S> the eps show antishadowing , while this effect is absent for the hkn and eps parameterizations in the @xmath62 domain . </S>",
    "<S> the more surprising feature is however the amount of shadowing in the different parameterizations . </S>",
    "<S> while the shadowing is moderate for ds and hkn parameterizations and somewhat bigger for eks one , the eps prediction has a much stronger suppression compared with the other parameterizations . for smaller @xmath6 around @xmath63 , </S>",
    "<S> while ds and hkn parameterizations have about @xmath64 suppression and eks one have about @xmath65 suppression , for the eps parameterization this effect goes to almost @xmath66 suppression in the nuclear gluon compared with the @xmath55 scaled gluon content in the proton ! for bigger values of @xmath6 the behavior is distinct for all parameterizations . as @xmath6 grows , the ds parameterization predicts that @xmath67 grows continuously to 1 , that means that the shadowing dies out when @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the same happens for the hkn one in this limit , but this growth starts only at @xmath69 , with @xmath67 being flat for @xmath70 . at @xmath71 , we have that behaviors predicted by the eks and eps parameterizations are similar , with @xmath67 exceeding 1.2 . the main distinction between these parameterizations </S>",
    "<S> is that in the eps parameterization one has a much steeper growth , from a much stronger suppression at smaller @xmath6 to the antishadowing behavior for larger values of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the distinct parameterizations observed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rg ] will be amplified in the exclusive quarkonium photoproduction in @xmath31 interactions due to the quadratic dependence on @xmath72 of the cross section . </S>",

    "<S> we extend this model for @xmath31 interactions and estimate the cross sections for the @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) process for rhic and lhc energies considering as input different parameterizations for the nuclear gluon distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the rapidity distribution and the integrated cross section are strongly dependent on the model considered for the nuclear effects . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that these quantities are powerful observables to discriminate among the different parton distributions in the nuclear medium . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the predicted shadowing by the eps parameterization is considerably larger than in the previous nuclear pdf s . </S>",
    "<S> this strong shadowing effect in the quarkonium photoproduction could be tested at the forthcoming lhc through the detection of two rapidity gaps with the lepton pair from the meson decay identified in the atlas , alice and cms detectors . </S>",
    "<S> our main conclusion it that the exclusive quarkonium photoproduction in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions is a useful tool to help in obtaining the correct gluon distribution in the nuclear medium . </S>"
