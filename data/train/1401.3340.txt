    "the absorption lines observed in the spectra of distant quasars ( qsos ) allow us to probe this tenuous cgm @xcite , which is otherwise not visible to us .",
    "however , the major drawback of absorption line spectroscopy is that one does not have any information about variations in the physical conditions of the absorbing gas in the direction transverse to the line of sight . closely spaced qso pairs ( or groups ) can provide useful information regarding transverse size and therefore the tomography of the absorber @xcite .",
    "the resonant transitions of five times ionized oxygen ( i.e. @xmath131031,1037 ) is a useful tracer of low density diffuse gas .",
    "the high cosmic abundance of oxygen and high ionization potential ( ip = 113.9 ev ) provide  doublets with immense diagnostic power .",
    "absorption is observed in a wide variety of astrophysical environments , e.g. igm @xcite , local ism and galaxy halo @xcite , hvc @xcite , cgm @xcite etc . in particular , in pioneering work , @xcite have shown that  absorption is ubiquitous in the cgm of isolated star forming galaxies .",

    "we use photoionization models to understand the physical conditions of the cgm of the galaxy as probed by the  absorption . moreover , we present a robust estimate of the cgm mass using the model predicted values of metallicity and ionization correction .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after presenting observations and data reduction in section  [ sec_obs ] , data analysis and photoionization models are presented in section  [ sec_ana ] . in section  [ sec_diss ]",

    "it is intriguing to note that this low ionization phase is detected only in system * 1a * but not seen in system * 1b*. therefore we put forward a scenario where the low ionization phase traces high density pockets , like hvcs , and the high ionization phase traces extended and diffuse cgm gas . the density difference between the two phases is more than two orders of magnitude .",
