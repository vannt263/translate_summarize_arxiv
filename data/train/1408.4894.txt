    "they observed , within a small range of the control parameter , a fast transition for the amplitude of the limit cycle varying suddenly from small amplitude to a large amplitude .",
    "due to the fact that the shape of the limit cycle in the phase plane looks as a duck they called it `` canard cycle '' .",
