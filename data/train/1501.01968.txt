    "the striking homogeneity in terms of iron abundance is usually considered as the main chemical signature of globular clusters ( gcs ) , indicating that these stellar systems were not able to retain the gas ejected by supernova ( sn ) explosions ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and this evidence brought to classify the system as the remnant core of a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy accreted by the milky way .",
    "in the last few years , deep and extensive spectroscopic and photometric investigations have revealed a more complex picture , with the discovery of other ( massive ) gcs harboring distinct sub - populations with different iron abundance , as terzan  5 @xcite and m2 @xcite , or with large but uni - modal iron distributions , as m54 @xcite and m22 @xcite .",
    "further suggestions of intrinsic iron spread are only tentative at the moment , either because based on ca  ii lines ( ngc5824 , * ? ? ?",

    "gcs , the case of ngc  3201 is controversial because different analyses provide conflicting results about its level of iron homogeneity . @xcite",
    "first analysed a sample of ctio high - resolution spectra of 18 cluster stars , finding large iron variations ( @xmath2\\sim0.4 $ ] dex ) .",
    "however , an evident trend between [ fe / h ] and the effective temperature casts doubts about the reliability of their [ fe / h ] distribution .",
    "the re - analysis of six of their targets performed by @xcite does not provide additional clues .",
    "further analyses by @xcite and @xcite , based on high - resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio spectra ( flames@vlt and mike@magellan , respectively ) , do not highlight similar spreads , ruling out large star - to - star variations . on the other hand , @xcite analysed uves@flames and mike@magellan high - resolution spectra of 24 giant stars of the cluster , revealing a metallicity distribution as large as 0.4 dex ( not explainable within the uncertainties ) and with an evident metal - poor tail ( 5 out 24 stars ) .",
    "this iron spread , qualitatively similar to that observed in m22 @xcite , would make ngc  3201 the least massive gc ( @xmath3 ; * ? ? ?",

    "recently , @xcite discovered effects due to the departure from local thermodynamical equilibrium ( nlte ) in a sample of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in the globular cluster 47  tucanae .",
    "such nlte effects affect the abundances derived from fe  i lines ( bringing to an under - estimate of 0.1 - 0.2 dex in [ fe / h ] ) , but leave the abundances from fe  ii lines unaltered .",
    "on the other hand , red giant branch ( rgb ) stars do not exhibit similar effects and the abundances from fe  i and fe  ii nicely match each other .    based on this finding , it is well reasonable to ask whether the star - to - star scatter measured in the fe content of ngc  3201 is genuine or it is due to such a spurious effect , because of the inclusion in the sample of some agb stars .",
    "note that the nlte effects can be easily unveiled by comparing the abundances derived from fe  i and fe  ii separately .    in this paper",
    "we re - analyse the spectra of the stars discussed in @xcite in light of the finding by @xcite .",
    "we limit the analysis to the uves - flames sample , including also the 5 stars populating the metal - poor tail of the @xcite distribution .",
    "high - resolution spectra taken with uves - flames@vlt @xcite for 21 giant stars members of ngc  3201 have been retrieved from the eso archive .",

    "for instance , the grid of nlte corrections computed by @xcite and @xcite predicts that the fe  i lines in agb and rgb stars should be affected in a very similar way at the metallicity of ngc  3201 .",
    "however , some additional effects / mechanisms could play a role in the agb photospheres , leading to the departure from the lte condition , which are not yet accounted for in the available theoretical calculations .",
    "we checked whether the mass assumed for agb stars could change our conclusions . the mass distribution of hb stars in ngc  3201 provided by @xcite ranges from 0.62 to 0.71 @xmath17 , with a median value of 0.68 @xmath17 .",
    "the minimum and maximum mass values correspond to a difference in log  g of 0.06 , leading to a variation in [ fe ii / h ] of only 0.02 - 0.025 dex ( and a variation in [ fe i / h ] of 0.002 - 0.005 dex ) . on the other hand , if we adopt the rgb mass ( 0.82 @xmath17 ) for all targets , as it is often done because of the difficulty to observationally distinguish between rgb and agb stars , the values of [ fe ii / h ] increase by only 0.03 dex with respect to estimate obtained assuming 0.68 @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the precise value of the adopted mass ( within a reasonable mass range ) can not reconcile the difference between [ fe i /h ] and [ fe ii / h ] .    as additional check , for each agb stars",
    ", the stellar mass has been varied until the ionization equilibrium was satisfied .",
    "the derived values range from @xmath00.2 and @xmath00.5 @xmath17 : such masses are too low with respect to the mass distribution of the hb stars derived by @xcite . in particular , for the stars # 89 , # 181 and # 240 , that exhibit the largest difference between [ fe i / h ] and [ fe ii / h ] ( @xmath00.2 dex ) , a satisfying ionization equilibrium can be reached only with masses smaller than 0.2 - 0.25 @xmath17 , which are very unlikely values for globular cluster agb stars .",
    "we demonstrated that the observed intrinsic star - to - star fe scatter in the gc ngc  3201 is due to unaccounted nlte effects in the spectroscopic analysis of some agb stars included in the sample .",
    "these stars suffer from nlte effects driven by the iron overionization , a mechanism that affects mainly the less abundant species like fe  i , but has no a significant effect on the dominant species ( e.g. fe  ii ) . when the gravity of these stars is obtained spectroscopically , forcing to have the same abundance from fe  i and fe  ii lines , the derived [ fe / h ] abundance turns out to be under - estimated .",
    "our findings confirm the conclusion by @xcite that the chemical analysis of samples of stars including both agb and rgb stars , and based on spectroscopic gravities , can lead to spurious broadening of the iron distribution .",
    "_ we conclude that ngc  3201 is a normal gc , without evidence of intrinsic iron scatter . _ in light of this result , it is not necessary to suppose that ngc  3201 was more massive in the past to retain the sn ejecta , as invoked by @xcite .",
