  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> we have investigated the step stiffness on cu(001 ) surfaces as a function of step orientation by two independent methods at several temperatures near 300 k. both sets of data agree well and show a substantial dependence of the stiffness on the angle of orientation . with the exception of steps oriented along @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the experimental stiffness is significantly larger than the stiffness calculated within the solid - on - solid ( sos ) model and the ising - model , even if next nearest - neighbor interactions are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> our results have considerable consequences for the understanding and for the theoretical modeling of equilibrium and growth phenomena , such as step meandering instabilities .    </S>",
    "<S> self - assembly of nanostructures is a key route on the roadmap of device technology at ever - shrinking lengths . </S>",
    "<S> several methods for self - assembly of nanostructures via kinetics , kinetic instabilities , or as equilibrium phenomena are associated with the properties of steps on solid surfaces @xcite . in the context of nanostructures </S>",
    "<S> the step stiffness @xmath1which describes the resistance of a step to meandering  is one of the key parameters in the widely applicable step continuum model @xcite . as the free energy cost per length ( along the macroscopic edge direction ) for elongating the microscopic length of a step due to fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath1 plays a central role in virtually all properties involving step excitations . for steps in equilibrium , the experimental and theoretical work focussed on spatial and temporal fluctuations and the repulsive or attractive interactions between fluctuating steps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when steps represent a growth front , stable step - flow growth occurs due to the presence of an ehrlich - schwoebel ( es ) barrier @xcite which hinders interlayer diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> this barrier , however , can also give rise to a step meandering instability : bales and zangwill @xcite showed that this form of instability selects a fastest - growing mode of meandering , which determines the morphology of the surface in the long - time limit . </S>",
    "<S> more recently it was shown that meandering can also be caused by a kink ehrlich - schwoebel barrier ( kese ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , a meandering instability was observed on cu(001 ) vicinals by maroutian et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the existing theories , while accounting qualitatively for the effect , fail to give such quantitative aspects as the temperature - dependence of the dominant wave length @xcite .    regardless of the precise cause of the instability , the forces driving the step into meandering compete against diffusion currents tending to smooth out gradients in the chemical potential @xmath2 along steps . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical potential is the product of @xmath1 and the curvature @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is the stiffness which keeps deviations from the mean direction low . for steps in equilibrium , such as on vicinal surfaces in the absence of growth </S>",
    "<S> , the stiffness determines the magnitude of the equilibrium fluctuations of steps and thereby the fluctuations in the terrace - width distribution .    unlike the surface stiffness , the step stiffness has a defined value for any orientation since a step is thermodynamically rough above temperature @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> present analytical theories of the meandering instabilities merely consider an angle independent (  isotropic \" ) stiffness @xcite and estimate @xmath5 as its value for a step orientation along the direction @xmath6 of close packing ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([eq : therm ] ) below ) . in monte - carlo simulations ( e.g. ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , where the modeling of the step meandering is based on the solid - on - solid ( sos ) model @xcite , a particular angular dependence of the stiffness is automatically built in by considering an angle dependent line tension ( step free energy per length ) @xmath7 ( since @xmath8 ) .    in this letter we show that not only the standard assumption of isotropic stiffness but even the angular - dependent step stiffness of the sos or ising model @xcite is far from reality for the much - studied @xcite cu(001 ) surface , typical of late - transition / noble metal surfaces and on which the meandering instability was observed @xcite : our experimentally determined stiffness varies by several orders of magnitude for orientations close to @xmath0 , in agreement with the sos and ising models . for larger angles , however , the experimental stiffness is about quadruple the value calculated in the two models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we will argue , this deviation can not be accounted for by including next - nearest - neighbor interactions . </S>",
    "<S> rather it must be attributed to many - body interactions such as kink - kink interactions and/or effective corner energies .    </S>",
    "<S> our step - stiffness data come from two independent experiments . </S>",
    "<S> one set of data is obtained by measuring the step - step distance correlation function for steps which are misoriented by an azimuthal angle @xmath9 from the high - symmetry , close - packed @xmath10 direction and therefore contain forced kinks . </S>",
    "<S> the second set is obtained by analyzing equilibrium shapes of two - dimensional islands @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 denotes the angle between the local island - edge orientation and the @xmath10 direction ( so that @xmath11 corresponds to the local slope ) rather than ( as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , e.g. ) the angle denoting the position on the perimeter @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiments were performed in a standard ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) chamber equipped with a variable - temperature microscope @xcite with high thermal drift stability . for the experiments on the step - step correlation function we used copper surfaces with miller indices ( 5,8,90 ) . hence , the surfaces are tilted relative to the ( 001 ) surface by the polar angle @xmath12= 5.98@xmath13 . the resulting monatomic steps on the surface </S>",
    "<S> are rotated with respect to the close - packed @xmath10 direction by a nominal angle @xmath14 , which corresponds to a density 0.23 of geometric kinks . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of orientation is naturally limited by the mosaic structure of the single crystal . </S>",
    "<S> crystal cleaning procedures followed established recipes @xcite after which the sample surfaces revealed clean parallel steps , which , however , merely on the average display the nominal rotation angle of 12.99@xmath13 of the ( 5,8,90 ) surface . </S>",
    "<S> the misalignment @xmath9 of the steps with respect to the @xmath15-direction varied locally between 0@xmath13 and 45@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the local area of constant angle was of order 10@xmath16 nm@xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 shows an stm image of the cu(5,8,90 ) surface at 301 k with @xmath18 , i.e. with an average concentration 0.13 of forced kinks . </S>",
    "<S> the mean value of @xmath9 of the steps was determined by averaging over all steps in the image . as is obvious from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , the @xmath10 direction ( black solid arrow in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) is easily defined in an stm image by the straight step segments between individual , monatomic kinks .    </S>",

    "<S> 1 ) @xcite , while @xmath23 is the atomic length unit ( along @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have measured the spatial correlation function @xmath19 for various angles @xmath9 on the cu(5,8,90 ) surface at temperatures between 293 and 328 k. for the highest temperature and larger angles @xmath9 , the plot of @xmath19 showed a small influence of the time dependence @xcite of the fluctuations by the curving of @xmath19 at small @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the slope in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) was determined for larger @xmath21 where @xmath19 was a linear . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting values for the dimensionless quantity @xmath24 are plotted in fig .  2 as gray symbols . </S>",
    "<S> the data points represent an average over 100 individual steps with a total step length of 1 - 2 @xmath2 m each . included as stars are data at @xmath9 = 0@xmath13 taken from previous work of our group for cu(11n ) surfaces , @xmath25=13 and 19 , for which @xmath26 = 0.019 and 0.0129 , respectively @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the step stiffness @xmath1 can also be determined experimentally by analyzing equilibrium shapes of islands @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> islands in equilibrium have a well - defined chemical potential which is the same all along the perimeter of an island . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical potential of the island is proportional to the product of the curvature @xmath27 of the island perimeter and the step stiffness @xmath5 ( via the gibbs - thomson equation ) .    for islands in equilibrium , as shown previously @xcite , the chemical potential can likewise be equated to the free energy per length @xmath28 of the densely packed steps oriented along @xmath10 divided by the distance of this step segment from the center of the island @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> then one obtains    @xmath30    since the absolute number for the step free energy @xmath28 for cu(001 ) is known from experiment , @xmath28 = 220 mev @xmath31 @xcite , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bt ] ) enables the calculation of the orientation dependence of @xmath32 from the equilibrium island shape . </S>",
    "<S> data were extracted from experiment by averaging over more than a thousand individual island shapes which were measured at temperatures between 287 and 313 k. the temperature dependence of the equilibrium shapes is small in the range of @xmath9 of interest here . using the mean shapes obtained for each temperature we have calculated the curvature as a function of the angle @xmath9 and furthermore , @xmath32 following eq.([eq : bt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature - averaged results are plotted in fig .  2 as solid diamonds . </S>",
    "<S> they agree quite well with the data from the correlation function @xmath19 , except for @xmath9 = 0 where it appears as if @xmath26 obtained from the island equilibrium shapes would be significantly higher . </S>",
    "<S> this is , however , an artifact of the island shape analysis . technically one can not determine the rapidly changing curvature of the island equilibrium shape near the @xmath10 direction .    </S>",
    "<S> dimensionless inverse stiffness @xmath32 measured via spatial step fluctuations ( gray symbols ) and via island equilibrium shapes ( solid diamonds ) . </S>",
    "<S> full squares represent eq.([eq : lowtstf ] ) and the dashed line is calculated from the temperature - dependent analytical solution of the island equilibrium shape in the nearest - neighbor ising model.,width=288 ]    the rapid descent of @xmath32 close to @xmath9 = 0 is a real effect . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that at @xmath9 = 0 and for moderate temperatures , @xmath26 equals twice the concentration of thermally excited kinks @xcite :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the kink energy . </S>",
    "<S> since the unit spacing @xmath35 between @xmath15 rows is the same as @xmath23 for an ( 001 ) fcc surface , we do not distinguish between them henceforth , calling both @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : therm ] ) is model independent and exact if @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to compare our experimental data for @xmath38 with theory , we make use of explicit exact expressions for @xmath7 for the nearest - neighbor ising and sos models @xcite , from which we obtain @xmath5 as @xmath39 . while the general expression can be readily handled numerically , @xmath40 in the present problem , permitting an expansion in @xmath41 ( which is of order @xmath42 when we specify @xmath34 below ) . for the ising model , rottman and wortis </S>",
    "<S> @xcite found    @xmath43    the energy - like first term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rwising ] ) makes no contribution to @xmath5 since it is canceled by its second derivative . we then obtain the following expansion for the stiffness :    @xmath44    the first term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : zlowt ] ) increases gradually but monotonically with @xmath9 , while the monotonically - decreasing coefficient of @xmath45 is sharply peaked at @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , except near @xmath46 ( specifically , so long as @xmath47 ) , the @xmath45 term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : zlowt ] ) can be neglected , leaving @xmath48    the result in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lowtstf ] ) can be obtained from a combinatorical analysis for the number of ways of arranging the kinks forced by the azimuthal misorientation @xmath9 @xcite . since we expect @xmath49 as @xmath50 , the expansion in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : zlowt ] ) evidently fails near this limit .    the temperature independent expression for @xmath38 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lowtstf ] ) is displayed in fig .  2 as solid squares . </S>",
    "<S> with the help of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bt ] ) @xmath38 can also be calculated for arbitrary temperatures from the analytical solution of the island equilibrium shape within the ising model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result is displayed as a dashed line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the ising parameter representing the kink energy as well as the step energy per atom was chosen as @xmath34=128 mev @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while experimental data and theory agree well for small @xmath9 , they disagree substantially for larger @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement for small @xmath9 is due to the fact that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) is independent of any assumption other than @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for the deviation at larger @xmath9 can be understood best by considering the special case @xmath9 = 45@xmath13 . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lowtstf ] ) one obtains    @xmath52    this result can be derived stragihtforwardly by considering the spatial correlation function @xmath19 for a freely meandering steps in the @xmath53 direction if overhangs are excluded and the statistical weight factors for microscopic paths take only nearest neighbor broken bonds into account . </S>",
    "<S> as overhangs are excluded the result is correct to terms of order @xmath54 which is an excellent approximation for the temperatures considered here . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath38 is lower than predicted by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : b45 ] ) must therefore mean that the @xmath55 oriented step ( @xmath9=45@xmath13 ; 100% kinked ) with one kink following another is energetically favored over paths which deviate from this orientation . </S>",
    "<S> this is in accord with the analysis of island equilibrium shapes @xcite , which found that the ratio of line tensions @xmath56 at @xmath57 k is 1.24 rather than @xmath58 as predicted in the ising model .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that diagonal , next - nearest neighbor interactions characterized by @xmath59 can not be the sole explanation . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to show that the experimentally observed line tensions for the @xmath55 and @xmath10-directions can not be fit simultaneously with the kink energy to a model with nnn - pair - potentials . </S>",
    "<S> as for the temperature dependence , nnn - interactions were considered , e.g. , in the akutsus study of si(001 ) @xcite . to leading order , their expansion factor @xmath60 becomes @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this change only affects the negligible @xmath45 term ; there is no change to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lowtstf ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the lower line tension of steps at larger angles @xmath9 and , in particular , that of a @xmath55-oriented step ( @xmath9=45@xmath13 ) and the lower corresponding spatial step fluctuations can therefore not be described by a nnn - pair potential . </S>",
    "<S> rather they must be attributed to many body interactions . </S>",
    "<S> such many body contributions might exist in the form of ( attractive ) kink - kink interactions and/or ( negative ) corner energies involved in the formation of kinks in a @xmath55-step . </S>",
    "<S> these interactions would keep a meandering step with a mean orientation along @xmath62 close to the central path which is also microscopically a @xmath55-direction and in which kinks follow immediately one after another . </S>",
    "<S> spatial fluctuations would therefore be smaller than in the ising model . models which might produce such behavior are under investigation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally comment on the consequences of the strong angle dependence of the stiffness on the step meandering instability @xcite . under plausible assumptions , </S>",
    "<S> the most unstable , fastest growing mode @xmath63 in a linear stability analysis . </S>",
    "<S> using then eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : therm ] ) for the calculation of @xmath64 not only overestimates the effective stiffness of the technically always slightly misoriented steps , it also introduces an unrealistic temperature dependence . </S>",
    "<S> a very recent theoretical study @xcite of the meandering instability of cu ( 001 ) did consider a step stiffness with angular dependence , but with behavior so different @xcite from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lowtstf ] ) to preclude useful comparison . recognition of the remarkable angular dependence of the stiffness is a crucial ingredient for attempts to account for the meandering instabilities @xcite and other statistical properties of vicinals and of single - layer islands . </S>"
