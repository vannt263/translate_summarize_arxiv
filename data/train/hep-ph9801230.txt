    "recent experimental work on the neutrino reconstruction technique , which has been used by cleo in the exclusive charmless semileptonic @xmath0 decay measurement @xcite , shows promise of measuring the hadronic invariant mass spectrum .",
    "a number of recent papers @xcite have renewed discussions on such possibility of determining @xmath1 . on the other hand , studies of the hadronic invariant mass spectra will also provide a testing ground for our understanding of the decay dynamics .    in this paper we will study the hadronic invariant mass spectrum and the decay width with a hadronic invariant mass cut in inclusive charmless semileptonic @xmath0 meson decays in a qcd - based approach @xcite .",

    "the approach has been described in [ 11 - 13,5 ] , which we refer to for a more complete exposition of the theory .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing the methods relevant to this analysis .",
    "because of the light - cone dominance , the nonperturbative qcd effects on the inclusive semileptonic @xmath0 meson decays can be disentangled and encoded in a distribution function : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the four - momentum of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "several important properties of the distribution function were derived from qcd . due to current conservation , it is exactly normalized to unity with a support @xmath29 : @xmath30 it obeys positivity",
    ". it contains the free quark decay as a limiting case with @xmath31 , where @xmath32 labels the @xmath13 quark mass .",
    "in addition , two sum rules for the distribution function can be obtained by using the operator product expansion and the hqet method @xcite .",
    "these two sum rules determine the mean value @xmath5 and the variance @xmath33 of the distribution function , which characterize the position of the maximum and the width of it , respectively : @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "the first matrix element @xmath39 measures the chromomagnetic energy due to the spin coupling between the @xmath13 quark and the light constituents in the @xmath0 meson and is determined by the mass splitting between @xmath40 and @xmath0 mesons . for the observed difference @xmath41 gev @xcite",
    ", one gets @xmath42 the second matrix element @xmath43 measures the kinetic energy of the @xmath13 quark in the b meson .",
    "a calculation using qcd sum rules yields @xcite @xmath44 taking @xmath45 gev , the mean value and the variance of the distribution function are estimated to be @xmath46 @xmath47 a non - zero value for @xmath33 indicates the deviation from @xmath31 , i.e. , the free quark decay , and is a measure of the amount of the nonperturbative qcd contribution .    to obtain the hadronic invariant mass distribution @xmath48 , it is technically convenient to start from the double differential decay rate @xmath49 , since the momentum transfer to the lepton pair , @xmath50 , is a quantity which has no distinction between the hadron level and the quark level .",
    "following @xcite , one can account for the nonperturbative and perturbative qcd effects on @xmath49 in a coherent way through the convolution of the quark - level decay rate and the distribution function .",
    "this double differential decay rate is then straightforwardly converted to @xmath48 . in the @xmath0 meson rest frame , the hadronic invariant mass spectrum in the inclusive charmless semileptonic @xmath0 decay",
    "is finally given by @xmath51_{p_b=\\xi p } , \\label{eq : spec}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 denotes the four - momentum of the @xmath13 quark .",
    "the detailed expressions of the quark - level double differential decay rate @xmath53 including the perturbative qcd corrections can be found in @xcite .",

    "however , since the distribution function has not yet been completely determined in qcd , for pratical calculations we shall adopt the following parametrization @xcite of the distribution function which incorporates all known properties : @xmath60^\\beta}\\theta(\\xi ) \\theta(1-\\xi ) \\ , \\label{eq : ansatz}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are four parameters , which are constrained by the sum rules ( [ eq : sum1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sum2 ] ) , and @xmath63 is the normalization constant . for @xmath64 , eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) becomes the ansatz of @xcite . in the following ,",

    "the value of the decay width is sensitive essentially only to the mean value of the distribution function whose value is known from hqet , and thereby the result is nearly model independent and the uncertainties in the calculation of the decay width are under control .",
    "however , the theoretical uncertainties in the partial decay width with a hadronic invariant mass cutoff less than 1.2 gev are very large , obscuring its usefulness for determining @xmath1 , since it is rather sensitive to the form of the distribution function .    we have observed the feature that for @xmath96 the decay width tends to show only little dependence on the invariant mass cut ( see fig .  5 ) and",
    "most of the @xmath12 events lie below @xmath97 ( see also figs .  1 , 2 , 4 ) .",
    "we have estimated the theoretical errors in determining @xmath1 in our approach . at the present time , the theoretical error on @xmath1 from the total semileptonic decay width for the @xmath3 decays is about @xmath89 . applying a hadronic invariant mass cutoff , the theoretical errors on @xmath1 are approximately @xmath90 for @xmath91 gev , @xmath92 for @xmath93 gev , and @xmath94 for @xmath95 gev , respectively .",

    ", the mean value of the distribution function is another key quantity for precise determination of @xmath1 , which requires as precise knowledge of the mean value as possible .",
    "based on this analysis and the previous one @xcite , a detailed fit to the measured charged - lepton energy spectrum and/or the hadronic invariant mass spectrum can be used to extract the parameters ( especially , the mean value of the distribution function ) experimentally .",
