    "the measurements of the deep - inelastic scattering structure function @xmath2 in hera @xcite have permitted the access to a very interesting kinematical range for testing the theoretical ideas on the behavior of quarks and gluons carrying a very low fraction of momentum of the proton , the so - called small @xmath1 region . in this limit one",
    "expects that non - perturbative effects may give essential contributions .",
    "however , the reasonable agreement between hera data and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) approximation of perturbative qcd that has been observed for @xmath3gev@xmath4 ( see the recent review in @xcite ) indicates that perturbative qcd could describe the evolution of structure functions up to very low @xmath0 values , traditionally explained by soft processes .",
    "it is of fundamental importance to find out the kinematical region where the well - established perturbative qcd formalism can be safely applied at small @xmath1 .",
    "the standard program to study the small @xmath1 behavior of quarks and gluons is carried out by comparison of data with the numerical solution of the dglap equations by fitting the parameters of the @xmath1 profile of partons at some initial @xmath5 and the qcd energy scale @xmath6 ( see , for example , @xcite ) . however ,",
    "if one is interested in analyzing exclusively the small @xmath1 region ( @xmath7 ) , there is the alternative of doing a simpler analysis by using some of the existing analytical solutions of dglap in the small @xmath1 limit ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "this was done so in ref .",
    "@xcite-@xcite where it was pointed out that the hera small @xmath1 data can be interpreted in terms of the so called doubled asymptotic scaling phenomenon related to the asymptotic behavior of the dglap evolution discovered in @xcite many years ago .    here",
    "we illustrate results obtained recently in @xcite .",
    "these results are the extension to the nlo qcd approximation of previous leading order ( lo ) studies @xcite .",
    "the main ingredients are :    * 1 . *",
    "both , the gluon and quark singlet densities are presented in terms of two components ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) which are obtained from the analytical @xmath0 dependent expressions of the corresponding ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) parton distributions moments .",
    "the @xmath9 component is constant at small @xmath1 , whereas the @xmath8 component grows at @xmath10 as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and the lo term @xmath13 and the nlo one @xmath14 with @xmath15 . here",
    "the coupling constant @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the first two coefficients of qcd @xmath21-function and @xmath22 is the number of active flavors .",
    "thus , our purpose is to demonstrate the small @xmath1 asymptotic form of parton distributions in the framework of the dglap equation starting at some @xmath23 with the flat function : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the parton distributions multiplied by @xmath1 and @xmath26 are unknown parameters that have to be determined from data . through this work at small @xmath1",
    "we neglect the non - singlet quark component .    in @xcite an effective method to reproduce",
    "the @xmath1-dependence of parton distributions has been developed .",
    "it is based on a separation of the singular and regular parts of the exact solution for the moments of parton distributions and on the method to replace mellin convolution by usual products @xcite .",
    "the method allows in simplest way to reproduce the lo results @xcite and to construct the @xmath1-dependence of parton densities at nlo : we use the notation @xmath27 for the coefficient in the front of the singular part when @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the corresponding regular part . ]",

    "the behaviour of eqs . ( [ 9.11 ] ) can mimic a power law shape over a limited region of @xmath43 : @xmath44 the quark and gluon effective slopes @xmath45 are reduced by the nlo terms that leads to the decreasing of the gluon distribution at small @xmath1 . for the quark case it is not the case , because the normalization factor @xmath46 of the `` @xmath47 '' component produces an additional contribution undampening as @xmath48 .",
    "-0.5 cm -0.5 cm    the gluon effective slope @xmath49 is larger than the quark slope @xmath50 , that is in excellent agreement with a recent mrs and grv analyses @xcite .",
    "+ indeed , the effective slopes have the asymptotical values ( at large @xmath0 ) : @xmath51 where symbol @xmath52 marks approximations obtained by expansions of modified bessel functions @xmath53 .",
    "the slope @xmath54 lies between quark and gluon ones but closely to quark slope @xmath55 ( see also fig .",
    "both slopes @xmath56 decrease with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "a @xmath1 dependence of the slope should not appear for a parton density with a regge type asymptotic ( @xmath57 ) and precise measurement of the slope @xmath56 may lead to the possibility to verify the type of small @xmath1 asymptotics of parton distributions .",
    "-0.7 cm    ( 0,70 ) ( -5,-5 )    -0.3 cm    with the help of the results obtained in the previous section we have analyzed @xmath2 hera data at small @xmath1 from the h1 collaboration ( first article in @xcite ) . in order to keep the analysis as simple as possible we have fixed @xmath58 mev which is a reasonable value extracted from the traditional ( higher @xmath1 ) experiments . the initial scale of the parton densities was also fixed into the fits to @xmath23 = 1 @xmath59 , although later it was released to study the sensitivity of the fit to the variation of this parameter .",
    "the analyzed data region was restricted to @xmath60 to remain within the kinematical range where our results are accurate .",
    "finally , the number of active flavors was fixed to @xmath22=4 .",
    "1 shows @xmath2 calculated from the fit with q@xmath4 @xmath61 1 gev@xmath4 in comparison with h1 data .",
    "only the lower @xmath0 bins are shown .",
    "one can observe that the nlo result ( dot - dashed line ) lies closer to the data than the lo curve ( dashed line ) .",
    "the lack of agreement between data and lines observed at the lowest @xmath1 and @xmath0 bins suggests that the flat behavior should occur at @xmath0 lower than 1 gev@xmath4 . in order to study this point",
    "we have done the analysis considering @xmath5 as a free parameter . comparing the results of the fits ( see @xcite )",
    "one can notice the better agreement with the experiment of the nlo curve at fitted @xmath62 ( solid curve ) is apparent at the lowest kinematical bins .    finally with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ 11.1 ] ) we have estimated the @xmath2 effective slope using the value of the parameters extracted from nlo fits to data . for h1 data we found @xmath63 .",
    "the lower ( upper ) limit corresponds we used the exact values of the slopes presented in @xcite . ] to @xmath64 gev@xmath4 ( @xmath65 gev@xmath4 ) .",
    "the dispersion in some of the limits is due to the @xmath1 dependence .",
    "2 shows that the three types of asymptotical slopes have similar values , which are in very good agreement with h1 data ( presented also in fig .",
    "the nlo values of @xmath66 lie between the quark and the gluon ones but closer to the quark slope @xmath67 .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with those obtained by others ( see the review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we have shown that the results developed recently in @xcite have quite simple form and reproduce many properties of parton distributions at small @xmath1 , that have been known from global fits .",
    "we found very good agreement between our approach based on qcd at nlo approximation and hera data , as it has been observed earlier with other approaches ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the nonperturbative contributions as shadowing effects , higher twist effects and others seems to be quite small or seems to be canceled between them and/or with @xmath68 terms containing by higher orders of perturbative theory ( see discussion also in @xcite ) . in our opinion , this very good agreement between approaches based on perturbative qcd and hera data may be explained also by the fact that at low @xmath1 values the real effective scale of coupling constant is like @xmath69 , where @xmath70 ( see @xcite ) . to clear up the correct contributions of nonperturbative dynamics and higher orders containing large @xmath68 terms , it is necessary more precise data and further efforts in developing of theoretical approaches .",
