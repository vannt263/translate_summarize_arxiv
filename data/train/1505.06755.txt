    "5(i ) where we see that most of the higher frequency components are reflected and most of the lower frequency components can transmit .",
    "this property may be used as a single photon frequency filter .",
    "there are multiple dips in the reflected spectrum due to fano - like interferences between multiple eigenstates @xcite .",
    "the reflectivity as a function of center frequency deviation for four different atomic separations are shown in fig .",
    "similar to the two - atom cases , the reflectivity is maximum if the center frequency of input photon is resonant with the atomic transition frequency for the cases when @xmath134 and @xmath127 , while the reflectivity is maximum if the center frequency of input photon is blue or red detuned from the resonant frequency for the cases when @xmath138 and @xmath143 due to asymmetric coupling .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the reflectivity curve when @xmath127 is about @xmath166 which is much broader than the one - atom and two - atom cases which is a superradiant effect of this collective many - body system @xcite .",
    "finally , we study how reflectivity changes as we increase the atom numbers in the chain .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) where we consider two atomic separations , i.e. , @xmath127 and @xmath134 .",
    "when @xmath127 , the reflectivity increases as the atom number increases and the reflectivity can approach @xmath0 if the atom number is large enough .",
    "however , when @xmath134 the reflectivity does not significantly change when we increase the atom number .",
    "therefore , to effectively reflect a photon , one way is by increasing the coupling strength and the other way is by increasing the collective coupling . to increase the collective coupling",
    ", we can increase the atom numbers but the separation between atoms need to be half integer of the wavelength .",
    "in previous sections , we have neglected the effects of the spontaneous decay to the free space . in this section",
    "we numerically study how the spontaneous decay of the atom to the free space affects the scattering properties .",
    "let us take @xmath167 atom for example . for two - atom system , eq .",
    "( 14 ) including @xmath6 becomes @xmath168 with @xmath169 , @xmath170 .",
    "it is readily to solve for @xmath171 and @xmath172 from eq .",
    "the spectra after the interaction can then be calculate from eqs .",
    "( 18 ) and ( 19 ) and they are given by @xmath173 where @xmath49 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "8(a ) and ( b ) where the black solid line is the spectrum of the input photon , the red dashed line is the spectrum of the reflected photon , the blue dotted line is the spectrum of the transmitted photon , and the green solid line is the summation of the reflected and transmitted photon in the waveguide .",
    "when there are only two atoms , the result for @xmath174 is shown in fig .",
    "8(a ) and the result if @xmath175 is shown fig .",
    "8(b ) . in both cases ,",
    "the total probability that the photon stays in the waveguide is reduced because the photon can leak out to the free space . however , we notice that the general features of the scattering spectrum do not change for smaller decay rate when @xmath174 , i.e. , there is a range of spectrum that can not transmit . in this case",
    "the photon has a probability about @xmath176 staying in the guided modes . for larger decay rate when @xmath175 , only about @xmath177 probability the photon can stay in the waveguide and the general features change where the photonic bandgap effect disappears .",
    "this is because the spontaneous decay can eliminate the interference of the emitted photon from the two atoms .",
    "however , if we increase the atom number such that @xmath163 the photonic bandgap effect appears again even if @xmath175 ( fig .",
    "this is because the collective coupling can be much larger than the spontaneous decay rate .    here",
    ", we should note that we have neglected the dipole - dipole interaction between the atoms induced by the vacuum modes in the free space .",
    "this is a good approximation if the atomic separation is not very small ( e. g. larger than @xmath178 ) @xcite .",
    "however , if the atomic separation is very small ( e. g. , smaller than @xmath178 ) , the dipole - dipole interaction between the atoms induced by the vacuum modes can be comparable with or even larger than the spontaneous decay rate @xmath6 and it should be included in the calculations . in this paper , we focus on the dipole - dipole interaction between the atoms induced by the guided modes which is a long - range effect and the smallest atomic separation used in the numerical calculations is @xmath179 where the dipole - dipole interaction induced by the vacuum modes in the free space can be safely neglected .",
    "in summary , we derive a time - dependent theory to study the dynamics of a single photon pulse propagates through a linear atomic chain which is coupled to a 1d single mode photonic waveguide .",
    "this theory allows us to study the real time evolution of a single photon transport and atomic excitations .",
    "the shape of the single photon pulses and the arrangements of the atoms can be both arbitrary .",
    "our result is consistent with the previous calculations when there is only one atom . for more atoms , the collective interactions can significantly modify the dynamics of the system .",
    "the reflectivity can approach @xmath0 for a photon with finite bandwidth by changing the ratio of coupling strength and the photon linewidth or by changing the number of atoms in the chain to increase the collective coupling strength .",
    "the spectrum of the reflected and transmitted photon can also be significantly different from that of the single atom case .",
    "we numerically show the photonic band gap effects where a bandwidth of frequency can not transmit and we can also tune this gap by changing @xmath102 or by changing the number of atoms",
    ". we can also reflect certain part of the frequency components but transmit the other part of frequency by controlling the collective coupling between the atoms .",
    "this may find important applications for single photon frequency filter .",
    "the quantum entanglement between distant atoms can also be created by the guided photon which may find important applications in quantum information and quantum computing . besides , we also demonstrate the fano - type interference and the supperradiant effects in this system .",
    "the spontaneous decay to the free space can reduce the photon amplitude that stays in the photonic waveguide .",
    "if the coupling strength between the atom and the waveguide mode is much larger than the spontaneous decay rate , the general feature is similar to the case when we neglect the spontaneous decay .",
    "however , when the spontaneous decay rate is comparable to the coupling strength between the atom and the waveguide mode , the feature of the reflected and transmitted spectrum can be quite different .",
    "however , if we increase the atom number to increase the collective coupling strength , the reflected and transmitted spectrum can have feature similar to the case without spontaneous decay rate .",
