    "deflagration - to - detonation transition ( ddt ) is one of the most important and least understood problems in combustion science .",
    "it is well known that a deflagration wave propagating from a closed tube end may spontaneously accelerate and trigger an explosion in the fresh fuel mixture , which goes over to detonation .",
    "the mechanism of ddt was described qualitatively already by shelkin @xcite . according to the shelkin explanation , thermal expansion in the burning process produces a strong flow in the unburnt fuel mixture , which becomes non - uniform because of non - slip at the tube walls .",
    "the non - uniform flow makes the flame curved , which increases the flame surface and hence the volumetric burning rate ; it makes the flow even stronger and leads to flame acceleration .",
    "an accelerating flame pushes compression waves and shocks , the temperature in the fuel mixture increases , the reaction goes even faster , until explosion happens ahead of the flame front and evolves into detonation .    for a long time it was a general belief that ddt is impossible without artificial turbulence generation . since turbulence and turbulent burning",
    "are not so well - understood yet , it presents a major obstacle in developing a theory of flame acceleration and ddt . only recently a constructive idea was suggested that ddt may be achieved even in a laminar flow in tubes with adiabatic walls .",
    "though it is difficult to obtain adiabatic walls in a real experiment , these conditions may be easily imitated in direct numerical simulations . starting with this idea ,",
    "the analytical theory of laminar flame acceleration was developed in @xcite ; the theory was quantified by extensive numerical simulations .",
    "the idea of laminar flame acceleration allowed also direct numerical simulations of ddt , e.g. see and a recent review .",
    "the simulations demonstrated many interesting details of the ddt ; at present it is not quite clear , which of them are intrinsic to ddt , making them the backbone of the process , and which are just supplementary effects of minor importance .",
    "one of these details is heating of the fuel mixture due to viscous stress , which makes the explosion preferential close to the walls .",
    "this is different from the classical shelkin scenario of ddt with heating produced mainly by the compression / shock waves .",
    "a quantitative analytical theory of explosion triggering by an isentropic compression wave ahead of an accelerating flame was developed recently in @xcite .",
    "this theory disregarded influence of the viscous stress .",
    "however , an important role for viscous stress is in line ( at least , ideologically ) with the model of the ddt , based on hydraulic resistance , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this model had another shortcoming ; it was one - dimensional and did not take into account shelkin acceleration , which is an intrinsic part of ddt .",
    "thus we came to the question , how strong the role of viscous stress is in heating of the fuel mixture and in ddt , taking into account the multi - dimensional shelkin mechanism of this process .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to answer this question .",
    "the paper considered only the geometry of smooth tubes , with no obstacles at the walls .",
    "we studied the role of viscous stress both analytically and numerically .",
    "the analytical study is based on the theory of laminar flame acceleration @xcite .",
    "the theory works excellently for low mach numbers , typical for the beginning of flame acceleration , about @xmath0 .",
    "we found temperature profile in the flow ahead of the flame front with maximal temperature increase achieved at the walls . we show that , at low values of the mach number , the role of viscous heating is extremely small",
    ", it scales as @xmath1 . by comparison , heating due to the compression wave scales as @xmath2 .",
    "however , temperature at the walls grows faster in time than at the axis . according to the theoretical estimates ,",
    "the heating effects of viscous stress and of the compression wave become comparable as soon as the mach number ( defined using total burning rate ) reaches values above 0.6 .",
    "another interesting point is that heating due to viscous stress does not depend on the reynolds number , at least as long as the mach number is sufficiently low .",
    "when the mach number becomes about 0.05 and higher , the theory @xcite works only qualitatively , providing order - of - magnitude estimates .    in that range of mach numbers we investigated the role of viscous heating by direct numerical simulations .",
    "the simulations were performed on the basis of compressible navier - stokes gas - dynamic equations taking into account chemical kinetics .",
    "it was again established that the fuel mixture is heated stronger at the walls than along the tube axis . in agreement with the analytical theory",
    ", we found that heating effects of viscous stress and compression wave become comparable at large values of the mach number ; viscous heating makes explosion of the fuel mixture preferential at the walls .",
    "the explosion develops in an essentially multi - dimensional way , with fast spontaneous reaction spreading along the walls and pushing rather strong shocks inclined with respect to the tube axis .",
    "eventually , the combination of explosive reaction and shocks evolves into detonation .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section ii we develop the analytical theory of heating due to viscous stress ; in section iii we describe the details of the numerical simulations ; in section iv we present and discuss the results obtained ; the paper is concluded with a short summary .",
    "we consider the same geometry as in @xcite : a laminar flame propagates in a two - dimensional ( 2-d ) tube of half - width @xmath3 with adiabatic walls and non - slip at the walls as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "burning matter expands as it passes the flame front ; density ratio of the fuel mixture @xmath4 and the burnt gas @xmath5 is typically rather large , @xmath6 . because of the thermal expansion , a flame propagating from the closed tube end pushes the unburnt fuel mixture and generates a flow .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the stream ahead of the flame may be closely approximated by a plane - parallel flow along the walls @xmath7 .",
    "the normal planar flame velocity @xmath8 provides a natural scaling of velocity dimension for the problem .",
    "however , the total burning rate @xmath9 is different from @xmath8 : it shows how much fuel mixture is consumed per unit time by the whole flame front and how much energy is produced . in the standard 2-d model of an infinitely thin flame front ,",
    "the relative increase in the burning rate is simply equal to the increase in the total length of the flame front .",
    "the propagating flame generates a flow , which is not uniform because of non - slip at the walls .",
    "friction retards the gas close to the walls , while flow velocity at the tube axis is larger than the average one .",
    "the non - uniform velocity profile distorts the flame shape , which leads to increase in @xmath9 and hence to flame acceleration . at sufficiently small values of the mach number , neglecting the starting transitional period ,",
    "the flame has been shown to accelerate exponentially @xcite @xmath10 for 2-d flow , the dimensionless acceleration rate @xmath11 was found to be @xcite @xmath12 where the value @xmath13 plays the role of the reynolds number for the problem . for large values of the reynolds number , eq .",

    "[ fig-2 ] .",
    "paper @xcite demonstrated a very good agreement of the theory with direct numerical simulations of acceleration flames .",
    "here we find the temperature increase in the fuel mixture ahead of the accelerating flame using the results above .",
    "similar to @xcite , we adopt the limit of incompressible flow , which holds in the case of a sufficiently small mach number . in that case the equation of thermal conduction in the fuel mixture is @xmath18 in the case of a shear flow @xmath19 , with @xmath20 , eq .",

    "in that case we separate heating in the compression wave ( at the axis ) , and the effect of viscous stress as temperature difference between the wall and the axis , @xmath164 .",
    "heating in the compression wave at the axis is shown by squares .",
    "temperature at the axis increases almost linearly with the mach number , in agreement with the theory , eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) , presented by the solid line .",
    "the theoretical prediction holds for a 1d isentropic flow ; small deviations of the theory and simulations indicate that the flow is not completely 1d and isentropic .",
    "two other solid lines show theoretical predictions for temperature increase due to viscous stress ahead of an exponentially accelerating flame , eq .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) , and in a stationary boundary layer , eq . ( [ eq24 ] ) .",
    "these two formulas present two limiting cases of strong acceleration and no acceleration at all .",
    "as we pointed out , at relatively high values of the mach number , the flame acceleration is much slower than exponential . by this reason it is natural to expect that the numerical points should be somewhere in between the predictions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig-7 ] shows that this is the case ; the numerical results come rather close to that of eq .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) , being a little above the theoretical curve . only at the end of the simulation run ,",
    "temperature at the wall increases drastically , which indicates the beginning of the explosion .",
    "it is also interesting to look at the temperature distribution in the channel .",
    "[ fig-8 ] compares temperature profiles at different distances ahead of the flame front at the time instant @xmath165 to the theoretical result eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) .",
    "the theoretical predictions look quite similar to the numerical results : all the time we observe the effect of viscous heating well - localized at the walls .",
    "still , the theory predicts a self - similar temperature profile independent of position , since it was developed for an exponentially accelerating flame in an incompressible flow . in the numerical simulations flame acceleration",
    "is not exponential , the flow is not incompressible , and the temperature profile changes in space and time . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig-8 ] , the transitional zone of viscous heating is wider close to the flame front , and it becomes more localized far away from the flame .    as we can see , heating due to viscous stress is not large in comparison with that in a compression wave , and , in principle , explosion theoretically could be possible even without viscous heating . fig .",
    "[ fig-9 ] presents temperature field snapshots in the area of the accelerating flame from beginning of the explosion till detonation .",
    "prior to the explosion , we can see light blue strips along the walls indicating regions of viscous heating . still",
    ", arrhenius reactions are extremely sensitive to temperature ; even this slight non - uniformity influences strongly the structure of the explosion . the explosion may be observed already at the second snapshot : it develops in the form of two narrow tongues spreading fast along the tube walls from the flame front to the fuel mixture .",
    "temperature in the explosion zone is noticeably higher than it was behind the flame front .",
    "the tongues grow in length and width , until the original flame front becomes engulfed in the explosion .",
    "however , even at that time the explosion front remains essentially multi - dimensional : a large amount of the unburned matter separates two explosion tongues .",
    "the explosion pushes inclined pressure waves , well seen in fig .",
    "[ fig-9 ] by the light blue color .",
    "intersection of the pressure waves increases temperature at the channel axis , reduces the reaction time , until a bridge is formed between two tongues of the explosion . as",
    "two tongues meet , they soon develop into detonation , which can be seen in the last two snapshots of fig .",
    "[ fig-9 ] .",
    "meeting of two explosion tongues may be also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] . as an extremely sharp peak in the velocity dependence . strictly speaking ,",
    "this peak is infinitely sharp and high , since it corresponds to a singularity of pocket formation . in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] , we cut down the peak to make the plot more illustrative . in the present calculations ,",
    "ddt distance is @xmath166 , but this value is , of course , sensitive to a particular chemical kinetics .",
    "the purpose of the present paper was to investigate the role of viscous heating in ddt .",
    "we solved this problem both analytically and by direct numerical simulations .",
    "the analytical theory was developed within the approximation of incompressible flow , which holds at sufficiently low values of the mach number .",
    "on the contrary , the numerical simulations were performed for relatively large mach numbers . both theory and",
    "numerical simulations demonstrated that the role of viscous heating increases with the mach number .",
    "viscous stress makes temperature higher at the channel walls in comparison with the axis .",
    "temperature profile in the channel is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) , temperature increase at the wall due to viscous stress is determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) .",
    "the theoretical results agree rather well with the numerical simulations , though , when making a comparison , one has to take into account much slower flame acceleration at larger values of the mach number . even just before the explosion",
    ", additional temperature increase due to viscous heating is noticeably smaller than the temperature increase in the compression wave .",
    "thus , viscous heating should be treated only as a supplementary process in ddt . in principle , ddt could be possible with heating provided by the compression wave only in line with the shelkin scenario @xcite .",
    "still , neglecting viscous heating in a theoretical model like @xcite may lead to considerable disagreement in the time and distance of detonation triggering predicted by the theory and obtained in experiments / numerical simulations .",
    "viscous heating makes explosion triggering easier and faster because of extreme sensitivity of arrhenius reactions to temperature variations . in a certain sense",
    ", it plays the same role as hot spots : it is not necessary , but helpful .",
    "non - uniform temperature distribution leads to an essentially multi - dimensional structure of the explosion , which pushes inclined pressure waves and eventually develops into detonation .",
