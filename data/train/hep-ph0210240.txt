    "there has been considerable interest lately in a new approach to model  building called `` dimensional deconstruction '' ( dd ) . in the beginning , there were two views of dd .",
    "the one we discuss in this paper is due to arkani - hamed , cohen and georgi ( acg )  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the fact that certain renormalizable , asymptotically free 4d field theories look , _ for a limited range of energies _ , like @xmath5dimensional theories in which the extra dimensions are compactified and discretized ( on a periodic lattice ) . here , the extra dimensions are a mirage .",
    "the other view is that of hill and his collaborators  @xcite who assume the extra dimensions are real .",
    "they discretize the extra dimensions too  to regulate the theory .",
    "both arkani - hamed _",
    "et al . _ and hill _",
    "_ use features of the higher dimensional model to deduce the form , magnitude , and sensitivity to high  scale ( @xmath2 ) physics of phenomenologically important operators such as mass terms ( generically , @xmath0 ) , self  interactions ( @xmath6 ) , and vevs ( @xmath1 ) of light _ composite",
    "_ higgs bosons ( lch )  @xcite .",
    "their lch models aim for @xmath7200  gev and @xmath8 , relevant to electroweak symmetry breaking .    to 7.5 cm",
    "the simplest dd example is the @xmath9 `` moose ring '' model  @xcite depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "this shows the full content ( `` uv  completed '' ) of the model at the high energy scale @xmath2 .",
    "it contains @xmath10 strong @xmath11 and weak @xmath12 ( coupling @xmath13 ) gauge groups , with matter fields that are the massless chiral fermions [ eq : fermionsa ] & & _ lk ( n , m,1 ) , _ rk ( n,1,m ) + & & ( su(n)_k , su(m)_k , su(m)_k+1 ) .",
    "the index @xmath14 is periodically identified with @xmath15 . as @xmath16 , these fermions have a large chiral symmetry , @xmath17^n$ ] . at @xmath2 ,",
    "the strong @xmath11 interactions cause them to condense , creating @xmath10 sets of @xmath18 _ composite _ goldstone bosons ( gbs ) , @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "their decay constant @xmath22 .",
    "below @xmath2 , this is a nonlinear sigma model , with fields @xmath23 interacting with the weakly  coupled @xmath24 gauge fields @xmath25 .",
    "they transform as @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "this low energy theory is represented by the `` condensed moose '' obtained from fig .  1 by erasing the @xmath11 squares and linking the @xmath24 and @xmath28 circles by @xmath29 .",
    "now , @xmath30 gauge boson multiplets eat @xmath30 sets of gbs and acquire the masses @xmath31 for @xmath20 . the massless gauge field",
    "@xmath32 couples with strength @xmath33 and the uneaten gb is @xmath34 . in the unitary gauge ,",
    "the 4d theory below @xmath2 is described by uniform link variables @xmath35 plus the massless and massive gauge fields .",
    "alternatively , at energies well below @xmath36 , this looks like a 5d gauge theory : the fifth dimension is compactified on a discretized circle , represented exactly by the _ condensed _ moose . for @xmath37 , there is a kaluza ",
    "klein tower of gauge excitations with masses @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "the circumference of the circle is @xmath39 where the lattice spacing @xmath40 and the 5dimensional gauge coupling is @xmath41 .",
    "the fifth component of the gauge boson @xmath42 .",
    "the geometrical connection is clear : @xmath43 is the zero mode associated with rotation about the circle of @xmath12 groups in four dimensions and it corresponds to the fifth  dimensional gauge freedom associated with @xmath44 . at higher energies , @xmath45 or @xmath2 ,",
    "the fifth dimension is deconstructed as the underlying asymptotically free 4d theory appears .",
    "but , @xmath43 is really a 4d pseudogoldstone boson ( pgb ) whose symmetry is explicitly broken by the weak @xmath24 interactions .",
    "so it might be a candidate for the lch of electroweak symmetry breaking . to be a truly _ natural _ lch , its vev @xmath4 also .",
    "this requires its quartic couplings @xmath46 or , at least , not @xmath47 .",
    "the idea of dd is that the magnitude and @xmath2dependence of @xmath48 and @xmath6 can be deduced from the higher dimensional theory .",
    "let s see .",
    "higher dimensional gauge invariance allows mass for @xmath49 from @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the nontrivial wilson loop around the fifth dimension  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath50 is a nonlocal operator , it can not be generated with a uv  divergent coefficient .",
    "on the discretized circle , @xmath52 $ ] . in the 4d theory",
    "this is just the gauge ",
    "invariant @xmath53 , and so this is what provides the mass for @xmath43 .",
    "standard power counting indicates that the strength of @xmath54 is @xmath55 .",
    "this is correct only for @xmath56 . for @xmath57 infrared singularities from the gauge boson masses at @xmath58 overcome this power counting .",
    "for @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a typical @xmath12 gauge boson mass . for @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "thus , for @xmath57 and @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 , as desired .",
    "dd predicts that @xmath43 will fail as an lch because the quartic interactions of @xmath49 are derivatively coupled and/or induced by weak @xmath12 interactions .",
    "this is true for @xmath43 as well .",
    "since @xmath66 , all quartic couplings of @xmath43 are @xmath67 .",
    "so , in this model , dd is a reliable guide . to achieve larger @xmath6 ,",
    "acg applied dd to a 6d model with nonderivative pgb interactions  @xcite .    to 7.0 cm",
    "consider a 4d theory described below its uv  completion scale @xmath2 by the condensed moose in fig .",
    "2 . this resembles a discretized torus with @xmath69 sites labeled periodically by integers @xmath70 . weakly  coupled ( @xmath71 ) gauge groups @xmath72 at the sites are linked by nonlinear sigma model fields @xmath73 and @xmath74 , transforming as [ eq : uvtransform ] & & u_kl = w_kl u_kl w^_k , l+1 , + & & v_kl = w_kl v_kl w^_k+1,l .",
    "the @xmath75 and @xmath76 comprise @xmath77 @xmath12 adjoints of composite goldstone bosons .",
    "the @xmath72 gauge bosons eat @xmath78 sets of gbs .",
    "the spectrum of massive gauge bosons , @xmath79 $ ] is kk  like for small @xmath80 .",
    "the massless gauge boson is @xmath81 and its coupling is @xmath82 . among the @xmath83 leftover pbs , two that acg proposed as light composite higgses are [ eq : piupiv ] _ u = 1_k , l _ u , kl , _",
    "v = 1_k , l _ v , kl .",
    "these are the zero modes associated with going around the torus in the @xmath84 and @xmath85directions .",
    "what does dd predict for the masses and couplings of @xmath86 ? viewing the condensed moose as the compactified and discretized dimensions 5,6 of a 6d gauge theory , the extra  dimensional gauge fields are @xmath87 . as before ,",
    "dd predicts small @xmath88 for @xmath59 and @xmath89 for @xmath62 .    in the 6d model , @xmath90",
    "have moderately strong nonderivative interactions  @xcite .",
    "they come from the term @xmath91 ^ 2 ) + \\cdots = \\lambda { \\hbox{\\rm tr}}([\\pi_u,\\pi_v]^2 ) + \\cdots$ ] which , in turn , arises from the `` plaquette '' hamiltonian [ eq : plaq ] _",
    "p = _ k , l _ kl f^4 ( u_kl v_k , l+1 u_k+1,l^v_kl^ ) + h.c .",
    "note that @xmath92 leaves @xmath86 massless .    in 6d",
    ", the quartic coupling may be shown to be @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "depending on the @xmath10dependence of the higgs masses , this may be large enough to give a higgs vev comparable to @xmath94 . in 4d , this prediction of dd fails .",
    "the strength of @xmath6 depends entirely on the nature of the toroidal moose model s uv completion .",
    "the most natural uv completion of this model is the analog of fig .  1 : at @xmath2 , there are @xmath77 massless fermions @xmath95 with strong @xmath11 interactions located midway between the weak @xmath12 s  @xcite .",
    "then , the plaquette interaction arises only from weak gauge interactions .",
    "it is of @xmath96 and , so , @xmath97 .",
    "it is possible to find uv completions of the toroidal moose that yield larger @xmath6 .",
    "they involve elementary scalars and , therefore , supersymmetry to avoid unnatural fine  tuning of parameters  @xcite .",
    "more generally , one can construct sigma models whose symmetries are tailored to give an effective lagrangian with _ arbitrarily and separately tunable _ @xmath48 and @xmath6at least at the one  loop level .",
    "this is the basis of an interesting new direction that has evolved from dd  @xcite . but",
    "this approach , called `` little higgs '' , has nothing to do with the original idea of deconstruction  that the strengths of a composite higgs mass and interactions may be deduced from corresponding terms in higher dimensional gauge theories .",
    "finding a truly dynamical , natural way of uv  completing little higgs models remains one of the greatest challenges to this new idea for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
