    ". however , the vast majority of stellar x - ray emitters cataloged in the rass are unlikely to be discovered from routine sdss spectroscopy .",
    "relative to their optical output , the most x - ray luminous normal stars ( i.e. , coronal emitters ) have log @xmath24  @xmath96 @xcite and so almost all are optically brighter than the @xmath97 mag sdss spectroscopic limit .        we have therefore combined the sdss photometric data with infrared data from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to select a sample of bright stars near bsc / fsc positions .",
    "when available , we used existing catalog data to classify the stars . in many cases , however , no spectral class is available , and we therefore used the apo @xmath3-m telescope to obtain spectra for objects in about @xmath98 of these rass error circles ( the total number of spectra collected is close to @xmath99 ) .",
    "we then used a spectral - template fitting code to classify the likely counterparts by spectral type .",
    "we also estimated @xmath24 ratios for all the stars based on their cataloged magnitudes and compared the ratios to those of known x - ray emitters of the same spectral type , thereby verifying that these stars are indeed plausible rass source counterparts .",

    "the output from sdssqa was matched to the rass sources in the dr1 footprint .",
    "this matching produced a list of @xmath108 rass sources with a bright / saturated sdss object within @xmath109 , roughly two - thirds of the total number of rass / dr1 sources .",
    "however , visual inspection of the sdss images for these sources revealed that a significant fraction did not have a nearby bright object .",
    "while a more conservative set of photometric cuts might eliminate many contaminants , it might also remove the real but saturated objects in which we are interested .",
    "we therefore used the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",

    "the initial spectrum suggested that we caught this m4 star flaring , and we returned to it regularly over the course of the next two years .",
    "all of the spectra include the balmer and caii h & k emission lines typical of m star spectra .",
    "however , these features are much stronger in the initial spectrum , as can be clearly seen in the bottom panel of figure  [ 0808_spec ] , where the spectra have been normalized to the value of their flux at @xmath522  .",
    "in addition , an emission feature at @xmath523   is evident in the initial spectrum and absent in the quiescent spectra . during a flare ,",
    "the amount of material emitting at chromospheric temperatures increases , and lines due to high - excitation species such as hei , which is responsible for this feature , appear @xcite .",

    "while the underlying spectrum corresponds to that of a k4 star , strong , persistent balmer emission is obvious ( see the top panel of figure  [ 1714_spec ] ) .",
    "the emission lines are broader than for the m star in figure  [ 0808_spec ] , suggesting that we are observing accretion rather than flaring , and there is therefore a currently invisible companion to the k4 star .",
    "on 2007 jul 16 , we obtained three more spectra of this star using dis in the high - resolution setup ( @xmath524   per pixel in the blue , @xmath525   in the red , with the gratings centered on @xmath522 and @xmath526   respectively ) .",
    "these spectra confirmed that the emission lines are broader than those of flaring stars , and also more structured than those typically seen in flares or in symbiotic systems ( see bottom panel of figure  [ 1714_spec ] ) .",
