    "the estimator which maximizes this quantity is equivalent to the estimator maximizing the following posterior average fidelity for every data set : @xmath12.\\ ] ] an estimator which maximizes this is called a _ _ bayes estimator__. bayes estimators are useful both to understand bayesian optimality and to provide upper bounds for the worst case performance .",
    "now here is the subtle and important point : the measurements performed , the data themselves and the distribution from which they were generated are not important once the posterior distribution has been calculated .",

    "in this work , we provide absolute benchmarks for the average fidelity performance of any tomographic estimation strategy by way of upper and lower bounds .",

    "up to date many options are available : linear inversion @xcite , maximum likelihood @xcite , bayesian mean @xcite , hedged maximum likelihood @xcite , and compressed sensing @xcite  to name a few . often estimators are compared by simulating measurements on ensembles of states drawn according to some measure and averaging the fidelity .",
    "this can only provide conclusions about the relative performance of estimators .",
    "thus , our bounds can be used to benchmark the fidelity performance of other candidate estimators .",
    "we complement our theoretical findings with numerical experiments .",
    "these demonstrate the relative tightness of our bounds and , in particular , reveal that the bayesian mean estimator is an excellent choice  owing to its near - optimal performance and ease of implementation .",

    "unfortunately , by making heavy use of the bloch representation of a qubit , the methods do not generalize .",

    "we first present the analytically soluble case of measures supported only on pure states .",
    "such a case is common in theoretical studies which average the performance of their protocols over the popular choice of the unique haar invariant measure on pure states .",

    "this solution also coincides with the one noted for a distribution supported on two states in @xcite .      for measures with support on mixed states , the situation is markedly different .",
    "our main technical contribution are new upper bounds for this case .",
    "we obtain them by replacing the fidelity function  which is notoriously difficult to grasp  in the main optimization problem by quantities that are easier to handle in full generality .",

    "having already outlined the main ideas necessary to establish such a result , we refer to for a complete proof .",
    "another way of establishing upper bounds on the average fidelity involves the concept of _ super - fidelity _ , which provides the following upper bound on the fidelity @xcite : @xmath32 although more involved , we shall see that such an approach yields strictly better bounds than the ones presented in . for brevity , we define @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 $ ] , such that inequality assures @xmath35 \\leq \\max_{\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{s } }   \\left ( \\mathrm{tr } \\left ( \\hat{\\rho } \\sigma \\right ) + p_{\\rho } \\sqrt{1- \\mathrm{tr } \\left ( \\sigma^2 \\right ) } \\right ) , \\label{eq : super_fidelity_maximization}\\ ] ] for any distribution @xmath15 .",

    "@xmath42 . as we shall show in",

    "that since we relaxed the maximization constraints , @xmath46 in general fails to be positive - semidefinite and is thus not a valid density operator , though we do not use it as such . in particular , the bound is not tight when @xmath47 is supported only on pure states  as might be evident from the possibility of non - positive states arising from the @xmath48 term in . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution is known and thus in the case of a distribution supported only on pure states , one should consult the exact solution in .",
    "conversely , if @xmath46 happens to be a state , it also solves the optimization and the analytical bound exactly reproduces an a priori tighter one . in all of our numerical experiments ,",

    "consequently the bound reproduces one of the main results in @xcite :    [ cor : bagan ] in the single - qubit case ( i.e. @xmath49 ) the bound exactly reproduces the maximum average fidelity in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 2.9 ) ) and @xmath46 is the optimal estimator .    finally , we want to emphasize that establishing bounds on the average fidelity by using the super - fidelity instead of the fuchs - van de graaf inequalities leads to strictly better results :    [ cor : majorization ] let the dimension @xmath0 and the distribution @xmath47 over states be arbitrary .",
    "then , the bound presented in is either trivial  i.e . equal to one  or it strictly majorizes the one presented .",
    "note that fidelity achieved by _ any _ estimator is a lower bound on the one achieved by the optimal estimator . a particularly convenient and generally well motivated @xcite estimator is the mean of the distribution @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "our findings underline that for distributions of states relevant to tomography , the mean is very near - optimal . in the context of tomography",
    "the mean is furthermore arguably the most convenient estimator , since every other quantity of interest requires its calculation anyway .",
    "finding an analytical expression for the posterior distribution is a very challenging problem , let alone performing the multidimensional integrals required for the calculation of the expectations above .",
    "thus , we turn to numerics . in particular",
    ", we use the sequential monte carlo ( smc ) algorithm , which has been successfully applied to quantum statistical problems in the context of dynamical parameter estimation @xcite and quantum state estimation @xcite . also , this algorithm is available as an open - source implementation in python @xcite .",
    "employing smc allows us to perform the bayesian updating and averaging .",
    "a complete and detailed discussion of the algorithm appears in ref .",
    "@xcite and thus we will not repeat the details here , but we will sketch the idea .",
    "the algorithm starts with a set of quantum states @xmath51 , the elements of which are called _",
    "particles_. here , @xmath52 is the number of particles and controls the accuracy of the approximation . by approximating the prior distribution by a weighted sum of dirac delta - functions ,",
    "@xmath53 bayes rule then becomes @xmath54 followed by a normalization step .",

    "the smc algorithm allows us to efficiently compute the multidimensional integrals with respect to the measure defined by the posterior probability distribution .",
    "we use this algorithm , as implemented by @xcite , to numerically compute averages arising in simulated tomography experiments . by doing so",
    ", we explore the efficacy of our claims for a variety of distributions relevant to practice and found natural in experimentation .     the average fidelity as a function of the number of single - shot measurements of the haar uniform measurement .",
    "the prior distribution is here is also the haar uniform measure on two qubits .",
    "the lines are the medians and shaded areas the interquartile ranges over 100 trials . ]    recall the sharp distinction between measures supported on pure states and those with full support .",
    "we use the fact that provides us with the optimal estimator in the former case to lend support to the claim that the mean estimator is a good candidate for a computationally simple , yet still near - optimal , alternative to solving the optimization problem in general . in , we present the results of numerical simulations on two qubits . plotted is the average fidelity achieved by the optimal estimator ( see ) and the mean estimator @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the average is taken with respect to a distribution that begins as the haar invariant measure on pure states and is updated through simulated measurement data , where the measurement is the `` uniform povm '' consisting of all pure states , distributed uniformly according to the haar measure .",
    "for independent measurements ",
    "local , non - adaptive ones  this measurement is optimal ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) .",
    "we see that the mean estimator s fidelity tracks the optimal fidelity quite well .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in , we plot the average fidelity of the mean estimator against our bound for measures supported also on mixed quantum states . again",
    ", we simulate measurement data to get an accurate sense of how well the average fidelity of the mean estimator performs with respect to our bound for distributions relevant to tomography . in this case , the _ prior _ distribution is either the hilbert - schmidt measure ( left column ) , or the _ arcsine _ and _ bures _ distributions @xcite for two qubits ( right column ) . in each case , many other natural distributions appear as we update our prior through bayes rule .",
    "we see again that the mean estimator is a `` good '' estimator in that it comes close to the bound on the optimal fidelity and is the easiest non - trivial average quantity to evaluate .",
    "in this section we provide detailed derivations and proofs of the statements presented in .      recall",

    "adding and subtracting @xmath163 in the last square root and once more invoking monotonicity allows us to continue via @xmath167 where we have used @xmath164 in the last line to obtain strict inequality .",
    "since the square root is a concave function , the inequality @xmath168 is valid for any @xmath169 and consequently @xmath170 is true .",
    "finally , we use the simple fact that @xmath171 holds for any @xmath172 to arrive at @xmath173 which is just the fuchs - van de graaf bound . since a strict inequality sign connects the expressions in , the claimed strict majorization follows .",

    "this assures @xmath191 by construction .",
    "one way to establish that @xmath184 is furthermore itself an euclidean ball , is using `` generalized cylindrical coordinates '' for the euclidean unit ball @xmath192 : such coordinates use the fact that @xmath193 is equivalent to the union of a family of @xmath183-dimensional unit balls . more concretely : let @xmath194 be an arbitrary unit vector and let @xmath195 denote a parameter .",
