    "if @xmath6 is not a tree then some component @xmath57 of some @xmath37 is non - separating and clearly such a component can be made disjoint from any finite collection of horizontal circles in @xmath1 . if @xmath1 could be imbedded in @xmath4 so that the complement consisted of handlebodies @xmath22 in which a complete collection of meridian boundaries were horizontal with respect to @xmath2 , then @xmath57 could be capped off in @xmath22 by adding disks to @xmath85 . the result would be a non - separating closed surface in @xmath4 , and this of course is impossible .",
    "conversely , suppose @xmath84 is a finite collection of horizontal circles in @xmath26 chosen so large that any horizontal circle in @xmath26 is parallel to an element of @xmath84 in @xmath26 .",

    "then replacing a vertical collar of @xmath89 in @xmath48 with two parallel horizontal copies of @xmath91 gives a surface which has fewer components of intersection with @xmath92 but which still contains a non - separating component , since the number of intersections with @xmath59 is increased by @xmath93 and so remains odd . since the boundary of @xmath91 is horizontal , generically it is disjoint from @xmath84 .",
