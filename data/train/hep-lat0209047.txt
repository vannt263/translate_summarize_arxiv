    "since we are computing a thermal trace , the worldlines from @xmath11 to @xmath12 define a permutation of identical fermions .",

    "in one spatial dimension , the pauli exclusion principle inhibits fermion permutations except in cases where the fermions wrap around the lattice boundary .  for the remainder of our discussion , therefore , we consider systems with two or more dimensions .  the first question we address is how far fermion worldlines can wander from start time @xmath11 to end time @xmath17 .",
    "we can put an upper bound on this wandering distance by considering the special case with no on - site potential and only nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "let us consider motion in the @xmath18-direction .",
    "for each factor of @xmath19 in ( [ 2d ] ) a given fermion may remain at the same @xmath18 value , move one lattice space to the left , or move one lattice space to the right .  if @xmath20 is the hopping parameter , then for large @xmath6 the relative weights for these possibilities are approximately @xmath21 for remaining at the same @xmath18 value , @xmath22 for one move to the left , and @xmath23 for one move to the right .  in ( [ 2d ] )",
    "we see that there are @xmath6 factors of @xmath24 .  therefore for a typical worldline configuration at low filling fraction , @xmath25",
    "we expect @xmath26 hops to the left and @xmath26 hops to the right .  for",
    "non - negligible @xmath27 some of the hops are forbidden by the exclusion principle .",

    "the expected wandering length , @xmath31 is therefore given by @xmath32    in cases with on - site potentials , fermion hopping is dampened by differences in potential energy .",
    "hence the estimate ( @xmath33 ) serves as an upper bound for the general case .",

    "in other words there are no permutations for worldlines starting outside of @xmath42 .",
    "we note that @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the logarithm of the restricted partition function with no worldline permutations at all .  since the zones are much larger than the length scale @xmath38 , the worldline permutations in one zone has little or no effect on the worldline permutations in another zones .  therefore @xmath45 using a telescoping series , we obtain @xmath46    @xmath47    for translationally invariant systems tiled with congruent zones we find @xmath48 where @xmath49 , the number of zones",
    ".  for general zone shapes one can imagine partitioning the zones themselves into smaller congruent tiles",

    "we will refer to @xmath51 as the zone size of @xmath52 .",
    "this is just one choice for zone extrapolation .",
    "a more precise and complicated scheme could be devised which takes into account the circumscribed volume , number of included lattice points , and other geometric quantities .    as an example of the permutation zone method",
