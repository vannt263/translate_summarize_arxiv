    "as a very good technique , the matching method can provide us an analytic understanding of the holographic superconductors in a straightforward way and help to confirm the numerical result . in this work ,",
    "we have used the matching method to investigate the holographic superconductors with lifshitz scaling and discussed the effectiveness of this analytic method . for the cases @xmath161 considered here , we found that the critical temperature decreases with the increase of the dynamical exponent @xmath0 , which shows that lifshitz scaling makes the condensation harder to occur .",

    "furthermore , we analytically studied the holographic superconductor with lifshitz scaling in an external magnetic field .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for the case of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in order to avoid a breakdown of the matching method we have to choose the matching point in an appropriate range which depends on lifshitz scaling , spacetime dimension and scalar mass .",
    "we argued that the physical conditions lead to the matching range in the analytic treatment . in this case",
    "we observed that a larger @xmath0 results in a smaller upper critical magnetic field , which is consistent with the numerical results .",
    "this shows that the dynamical exponent @xmath0 does have effects on the upper critical magnetic field .",
    "we also reproduced the well - known relation @xmath7 from the ginzburg - landau theory even in lifshitz black hole , which shows that the lifshitz scaling can not modify this relation .",
    "the result may be natural since we are working in the large @xmath159 limit .",
    "however , for other cases , i.e. , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , the matching method can not ensure the ginzburg - landau relation and the correctness of physical solutions @xmath79 and @xmath80 simultaneously , and fails to give the correct expression of the critical magnetic field of the holographic superconductor with lifshitz scaling .",
    "the fact implies that the matching method is not always powerful to explore the effect of the external magnetic field on the holographic superconductors .",
    "the extension of this work to the fully backreacted spacetime would be interesting .",
