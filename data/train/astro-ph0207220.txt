    "if it is due to neutrino conversions after all , something fundamentally new is going on in the neutrino sector . in that case",
    "much of the current thinking in this field will have to be revised .",

    "conversely , if the solar lma solution is indeed correct , the cosmic neutrino number density is well constrained by big - bang nucleosynthesis so that a laboratory measurement of the absolute neutrino masses , for example in the katrin tritium experiment @xcite , would directly establish the cosmic neutrino mass fraction . moreover",

    "7 summarizes the status of neutrino masses in astroparticle physics .",
    "the cosmic number density of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos per flavor is @xmath20 with @xmath21 the number density of cosmic microwave photons , and assuming that there is no neutrino chemical potential . with @xmath22",
    "this translates into @xmath23 .",
    "if neutrinos have masses one finds a cosmic mass  fraction @xmath24 where as usual @xmath25 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath26 .",
    "the requirement that neutrinos do not overclose the universe then leads to the traditional mass limit @xmath27 , an argument that was first advanced in a classic paper by @xcite .",
    "later @xcite speculated that massive neutrinos could actually constitute the dark matter of the universe .",
    "however , it soon became clear that neutrinos were not a good dark matter candidate for two reasons .",
    "the first argument is based on the limited phase space for neutrinos gravitationally bound to a galaxy @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "if massive neutrinos are supposed to be the dark matter in galaxies , they must obey a _",
    "lower _ mass limit of some 30  ev for typical spirals , and even 100200  ev for dwarf galaxies .    today",
    "the most restrictive laboratory limits on the overall neutrino mass scale arise from the mainz @xcite and troitsk @xcite tritium end - point experiments .",
    "the current limit is @xcite @xmath28 this limit applies to all mass eigenstates if we accept that the mass differences are as small as indicated by the atmospheric and solar oscillation interpretation .",
    "this limit is so restrictive that neutrinos as galactic dark matter are completely out of the question , even without any further appeal to cosmic structure formation arguments .",
    "however , cosmic structure formation does place powerful limits on the neutrino mass .",
    "the observed structure in the distribution of galaxies is thought to arise from the gravitational instability of primordial density fluctuations .",
    "the small masses of neutrinos imply that they stay relativistic for a long time after their decoupling ( `` hot dark matter '' ) , allowing them to stream freely , thereby erasing the primordial density fluctuations on small scales @xcite . while this effect does not preclude neutrino dark matter , it implies a top - down scenario for structure formation where large structures form first , later fragmenting into smaller ones .",
    "it was soon realized that the predicted properties of the large - scale matter distribution did not seem to agree with observations and that neutrino dark matter was apparently ruled out @xcite .    today",
    "it is widely accepted that the universe has critical density and that its matter inventory sports several nontrivial components .",
    "besides some 5% baryonic matter ( most of it dark ) there are some 25% cold dark matter in an unidentified physical form and some 70% of a negative - pressure component ( `` dark energy '' ) . and because neutrinos do have mass , they contribute at least 0.1% of the critical density .",
    "this fraction is based on a hierarchical mass scenario with @xmath29 , the smallest value consistent with atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "an upper limit on the neutrino dark matter fraction can be derived from the measured power spectrum @xmath30 of the cosmic matter distribution .",
    "neutrino free streaming suppresses the small - scale structure by an approximate amount @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the cosmic mass fraction in matter , i.e.excluding the dark energy .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] where @xmath30 measured by the 2df galaxy redshift survey is shown and compared with the predictions for a cold dark matter cosmology with neutrino fractions @xmath33 , 0.01 , and 0.05 , respectively @xcite . when the theoretical curves are normalized to the power at large scales , neutrinos indeed suppress @xmath30 at large @xmath34 .    based on the 2dfgrs data , @xcite and @xcite",
    "find limits on @xmath35 in the range 1.83.0  ev , depending on the assumed priors for other cosmological parameters , notably the hubble constant , the overall matter fraction @xmath32 , and the tilt of the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations .",
    "for a reasonable set of priors one may adopt @xmath36 at a statistical confidence level of 95% .",
    "this limit corresponds approximately to the dot - dashed ( @xmath37 ) curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , i.e.  neutrinos may still contribute as much as 5% of the critical density , about as much as baryons .    within the framework of the standard theory of structure formation , the largest systematic uncertainty comes from the unknown biasing parameter @xmath38 which relates the power spectrum of the galaxy distribution to that of the true underlying matter distribution , @xmath39 .",
    "the biasing parameter is one of the quantities which must be taken into account when fitting all large - scale structure data to observations of the galaxy distribution and of the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation . in future",
    "the sloan digital sky survey will have greater sensitivity to the overall shape of @xmath40 on the relevant scales , allowing one to disentangle more reliably the impact of @xmath38 and @xmath3 on @xmath30 .",
    "it is foreseen that one can then reach a sensitivity of @xmath41 @xcite .    for a degenerate neutrino mass scenario the limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cosmicmasslimit ] ) corresponds to a limit on the overall mass scale of @xmath1 , far more restrictive than the laboratory limit eq .",
    "( [ eq : tritiumlimits ] ) .",
    "however , the katrin project for improving the tritium endpoint sensitivity is foreseen to reach the 0.3  ev level @xcite , similar to the anticipated sensitivity of future cosmological observations .",
    "if both methods yield a positive signature , they will mutually re - enforce each other .",
    "if they both find upper limits , again they will be able to cross - check each other s constraints .",
    "the laboratory limits or future measurements of @xmath0 and the cosmological limits or future discovery of a hot dark matter component can be related to each other if the cosmic neutrino density @xmath2 is known .",
    "however , the cosmic neutrino background can not be measured with foreseeable methods so that one depends on indirect arguments for determining @xmath2 .",
    "even if we accept that there are exactly three neutrino flavors as indicated by the @xmath42 decay width and that they were once in thermal equilibrium does not fix @xmath2 .",
    "each flavor is characterized by an unknown chemical potential @xmath43 or a degeneracy parameter @xmath44 , the latter being a quantity invariant under cosmic expansion .",
    "while the observed baryon - to - photon ratio suggests that the degeneracy parameters of all fermions are very small , for neutrinos this is an assumption and not an established fact .    in the presence of a degeneracy parameter",

    "the structure formation limits on the hot dark matter fraction provide a conservative limit on the neutrino mass scale @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , a laboratory limit on @xmath0 does not limit the hot dark matter fraction while a positive future laboratory measurement of @xmath0 provides only a lower limit on @xmath3 .",
    "big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is affected by @xmath47 in that a larger neutrino density increases the primordial expansion rate , thereby increasing the neutron - to - proton freeze - out ratio @xmath48 and thus the cosmic helium abundance .",
    "therefore , the observed helium abundance provides a limit on @xmath47 which corresponds to some fraction of an effective extra neutrino species .",
    "in addition , however , an electron neutrino chemical potential modifies @xmath49 . depending on the sign of @xmath50 this effect can increase or decrease the helium abundance and",
    "can compensate for the @xmath47 effect of other flavors @xcite .",
    "if @xmath50 is the only chemical potential , bbn provides the limit @xmath51 including the compensation effect , the only upper limit on the radiation density comes from precision measurements of the power spectrum of the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and from large - scale structure measurements . a recent analysis yields the allowed regions @xcite @xmath52 in agreement with similar results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the observed neutrino oscillations imply that the individual flavor lepton numbers are not conserved and that in true thermal equilibrium all neutrinos are characterized by one single chemical potential @xmath45 .",
    "if flavor equilibrium is achieved before @xmath48 freeze - out the restrictive bbn limit on @xmath50 applies to all flavors , i.e.  @xmath53 , implying that the cosmic number density of neutrinos is fixed to within about 1% . in that case",
    "the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath0 is uniquely given by the standard expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : oega_nu ] ) .",
    "the approach to flavor equilibrium in the early universe by neutrino oscillations and collisions was recently studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "assuming the atmospheric and solar lma solutions , an example for the cosmic flavor evolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the detailed treatment is rather complicated and involves a number of subtleties related to the large weak potential caused by the neutrinos themselves as they oscillate .",
    "the intriguing phenomenon of synchronized flavor oscillations @xcite plays an important and subtle role .",
    "the practical bottom line , however , is rather simple .",
    "effective flavor equilibrium before @xmath48 freeze - out is reliably achieved if the solar oscillation parameters are in the favored lma region . in the low region",
    ", the result depends sensitively on the value of the small but unknown third mixing angle @xmath54 . in the sma and vac regions , which are now heavily disfavored ,",
    "equilibrium is not achieved .",
    "therefore , establishing lma as the correct solution of the solar neutrino problem amounts in our context to counting the number of cosmological neutrinos and thus to establishing a unique relationship between the neutrino mass scale @xmath0 and the cosmic neutrino density @xmath3 . a final confirmation of lma is expected by the kamland reactor experiment @xcite within the next few months of this writing .",
    "the number density and mass of cosmic background neutrinos is also relevant for the propagation of extremely high - energy ( ehe ) neutrinos that may be produced by hitherto unknown astrophysical sources at cosmological distances . assuming that neutrinos with energies in the @xmath55@xmath56  ev range are somewhere injected in the universe , and assuming that the cosmic background neutrinos have masses in the neighborhood of 1  ev , the center - of - momentum energy is in the neighborhood of the @xmath42 boson mass .",
    "put another way , the required neutrino energy for the @xmath42-resonance is @xmath57 the subsequent decay of the @xmath42-bosons on average produces two nucleons , 10  @xmath58 mesons which subsequently decay into photons , and 17  @xmath59 mesons which subsequently decay into @xmath60 and neutrinos . these @xmath19-bursts would be a source for cosmic rays at the upper end of the observed spectrum , i.e.  with energies at and above @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the motivation for considering this sort of scenario is the difficulty of explaining the observed highest - energy cosmic rays which exceed the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff , i.e.  which can not reach us from large distances because the cosmic microwave background renders the universe opaque for protons around and above @xmath61 .",
    "no compelling explanation for the super - gzk cosmic rays exists , leaving much room and motivation for speculations and exotic scenarios @xcite .",
    "of course , the @xmath19-burst scenario is not a real explanation because it appeals to unknown ehe neutrino sources producing huge fluxes and with rather exotic properties @xcite .",
    "however , one should view this scenario as an opportunity .",
    "the required ehe neutrino fluxes are below current limits , but are accessible to future experiments such as the icecube neutrino telescope at the south pole or the auger air shower array in argentina ( fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) . therefore ,",
    "if such fluxes are detected they provide a handle on sub - ev masses of the cosmic background neutrinos by virtue of the @xmath19-burst production of super - gzk cosmic rays .",
    "this would be the only evidence for the cosmic neutrino background and its properties other than provided by big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "neutrino masses in the sub - ev range can play an interesting albeit indirect role for creating the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) in the framework of leptogenesis scenarios @xcite .",
    "the main ingredients are those of the usual see - saw scenario for small neutrino masses . restricting ourselves to a single family ,",
    "the relevant parameters are the heavy majorana mass @xmath62 of the ordinary neutrino s right - handed partner and a yukawa coupling @xmath63 between the neutrinos and the higgs field @xmath64 .",
    "the observed neutrino then has a majorana mass @xmath65 that can be very small if @xmath62 is large , even if the yukawa coupling @xmath63 is comparable to that for other fermions . here , @xmath66 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field which also gives masses to the other fermions .",
    "the heavy majorana neutrinos will be in thermal equilibrium in the early universe .",
    "when the temperature falls below their mass , their density is boltzmann suppressed . however ,",
    "if at that time they are no longer in thermal equilibrium , their abundance will exceed the equilibrium distribution .",
    "the subsequent out - of - equilibrium decays can lead to the net generation of lepton number .",
    "cp - violating decays are possible by the usual interference of tree - level with one - loop diagrams with suitably adjusted phases of the various couplings . the generated lepton number excess will be re - processed by standard - model sphaleron effects which respect @xmath67 but violate @xmath68 .",
    "it is straightforward to generate the observed bau by this mechanism .",
    "the requirement that the heavy majorana neutrinos freeze out before they get boltzmann suppressed implies an upper limit on the combination of parameters @xmath69 that also appears in the see - saw formula for @xmath0 .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium condition thus implies an upper limit on @xmath0 .",
    "detailed scenarios for generic neutrino mass and mixing schemes have been worked out , see @xcite for a recent review and citations of the large body of pertinent literature .",
    "the bottom line is that neutrino mass and mixing schemes suggested by the atmospheric and solar oscillation data are nicely consistent with plausible leptogenesis scenarios . of course",
    ", it is an open question of how one would go about to verify or falsify leptogenesis as the correct baryogenesis scenario .",
    "still , it is intriguing that massive neutrinos may have a lot more to do with the baryons than with the dark matter of the universe !",
    "in principle , neutrino masses can be measured by the dispersion of a neutrino burst from a pulsed astrophysical source , notably a supernova ( sn ) .",
    "the time - of - flight delay of massive neutrinos with energy @xmath70 is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the distance to the source .",
    "therefore , if a neutrino burst has the intrinsic duration @xmath73 and the energies are broadly distributed around some typical energy @xmath70 , one is approximately sensitive to masses @xmath74 the measured @xmath75 burst of sn  1987a had @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , leading to the well - known limit @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "in a recent re - analysis @xcite find a somewhat more restrictive limit .",
    "either way , these results are only of historical interest because the tritium and cosmological limits are now much more restrictive .",
    "the neutrino burst from a future galactic sn could yield more restrictive limits because one would expect up to 8000 events in a detector like super - kamiokande for a typical galactic distance of around 10  kpc .",
    "with such a high - statistics signal the relevant time - scale @xmath73 is the fast rise - time of around 100  ms rather than the overall burst duration of several seconds .",
    "therefore , one is sensitive to smaller masses than the sn  1987a burst , despite the shorter baseline . from detailed monte - carlo simulations",
    "@xcite infers that super - kamiokande would be sensitive to about @xmath80 , almost independently of the exact distance .",
    "( at a larger distance one gains baseline but loses statistics , two effects that cancel for a given detector size . )",
    "conceivably this sensitivity could be improved if a gravitational wave signal could be detected preceding the neutrinos , signifying the instant of the stellar collapse @xcite . in this case",
    "one may be sensitive to about 1  ev .",
    "it is also conceivable that a sn collapses to a black hole some short time after the original collapse . in this case",
    "the neutrino signal would abruptly terminate ( within @xmath81 ) , thereby defining a very short time scale .",
    "@xcite found that super - kamiokande would be sensitive to @xmath82 .    in the foreseeable future megatonne neutrino detectors",
    "may be constructed to search for proton decay and to perform precision long - baseline oscillation measurements with neutrino beams .",
    "such detectors would have about 30 times the fiducial volume of super - kamiokande .",
    "the exact @xmath0 sensitivity for such an instrument has not been worked out . with a megatonne detector",
    "one could measure sn neutrinos throughout the local group of galaxies .",
    "from andromeda at a distance of 750  kpc one would get around 50 events . using the overall signal duration for @xmath73 yields a sensitivity in the few ev range .",
    "the only conceivable time - of - flight technique that could probe the sub - ev range involves gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) which have been speculated to be strong neutrino sources .",
    "if the neutrino emission shows time structure on the millisecond scale , and assuming a cosmological distance of 1  gpc , one would be sensitive to neutrino masses @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , observing millisecond time structure in sub - gev neutrinos from a grb would be sensitive to the sub - ev mass scale @xcite .",
    "the compelling detection of flavor oscillations in the solar and atmospheric neutrino data have triggered a new era in neutrino physics . in the laboratory one",
    "will proceed with precision experiments aimed at measuring the details of the mixing matrix .",
    "future tritium decay experiments may well be able to probe the overall neutrino mass scale down to the 0.3  ev range , but if the absolute masses are smaller , it will be very difficult to measure them , and the overall mass scale may remain the most important unknown quantity in neutrino physics for a long time to come .    unfortunately , it is unlikely that astrophysical time - of - flight methods will help much .",
    "foreseeable sn neutrino detectors are sensitive to ev masses , but not the sub - ev range . on the bright side",
    "this means that the measured neutrino light - curve of a future galactic sn will faithfully represent the source without much modifications by neutrino dispersion .",
    "cosmological large - scale structure data at present provide the most restrictive limit on neutrino masses of @xmath84 , corresponding to @xmath1 in a degenerate mass scenario .",
    "a rigorous relationship between the cosmic hot dark matter fraction @xmath3 and @xmath0 depends on the cosmic neutrino density  @xmath2 .",
    "if the solar lma solution is correct , big - bang nucleosynthesis constrains @xmath2 without further assumptions about the neutrino chemical potentials . in the lma case",
    "neutrinos reach de - facto flavor equilibrium before the epoch of weak - interaction freeze out .    while neutrinos do not play a dominant role for dark matter or structure formation , the mass and mixing schemes suggested by the oscillation experiments are nicely consistent with leptogenesis scenarios for creating the cosmic baryon asymmetry .",
    "therefore , massive neutrinos may be closely related to the baryons in the universe , not the dark matter .",
    "if extremely - high energy neutrinos will be observed in future , the @xmath19-burst scenario provides a handle on the cosmic background neutrinos and their mass through the observed cosmic rays near the gzk cutoff .    the great advance in our knowledge of neutrino properties together with the cosmological precision information has rendered the question of neutrino masses in astrophysics and cosmology far more subtle than it looked only a few years ago .",
    "we will not know if the accumulation of new results would have persuaded dennis sciama that nature has used massive neutrinos perhaps in different ways for cosmology than he himself had imagined for so long .",
