    "@xcite reported the discovery of the most massive ( 1.2@xmath5 ) , hydrogen- and metal - rich daz white dwarf ever found ; gd362 ( wd 1729 + 371 ) .",
    "in addition to balmer lines , they detected , , , and lines in the optical spectra of this star with estimated @xmath6 9740 k and @xmath7 g = 9.1 .",
    "they measured nearly - solar abundances for these metals .",
    "the discovery of infrared excess @xcite and a silicate emission feature at @xmath8 m @xcite demonstrated that gd 362 hosts a circumstellar dust disk and the metals are likely to be accreted from this disk .",
    "the discovery of debris disks around other normal mass white dwarfs ( @xmath9 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the lack of disks around massive white dwarfs with @xmath10 @xcite showed that , if gd 362 is as massive as 1.2@xmath5 , it is unique .",
    "@xcite proposed to explain the high mass of gd 362 by a merger of two lower mass white dwarfs , a rare event in our galaxy ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they also suggested that the merger scenario is able to explain the observed photospheric composition of metals and the infrared excess of the surrounding debris disk .",
    "a caveat in the model atmosphere analysis , and therefore surface gravity and mass determinations , of gd 362 is the presence of helium .",
    "helium lines become invisible below @xmath11 11,000 k , and weak lines can only be seen if helium is present in significant amounts .",
    "@xcite found that the balmer line profiles in the optical spectrum of gd 362 are equally well reproduced even if there is a significant amount of helium in the atmosphere .",
    "no helium lines were visible in the low resolution spectrum of @xcite .",
    "however , a high resolution and high signal - to - noise spectrum of gd 362 obtained by @xcite revealed a helium absorption line at 5876  , demonstrating that helium is present in significant amounts . a detailed model atmosphere analysis of this spectrum implied that gd 362 has @xmath6 10,540 @xmath12 200 k ,",
    "@xmath7 g = 8.24 @xmath12 0.04 , @xmath7 [ he / h ] = 1.14 @xmath12 0.10 , and @xmath13 ; gd 362 may not be unique ( in terms of its mass ) after all .",
    "the high mass measurement for gd 362 implies a distance of 22 - 26 pc @xcite , whereas the lower mass solution found by @xcite implies twice the distance .",
    "discriminating between these two solutions requires parallax observations . in this letter",
    ", we present trigonometric parallax observations of gd 362 .",
    "our observations and reduction procedures are discussed in  2 , while the observed parallax and its implications are discussed in  3 and  4 .",
    "our parallax images are from the 2.4 m hiltner reflector at mdm observatory on kitt peak , arizona .",
    "we used a total of 117 images taken on seven observing runs spanning two seasons ; table 1 summarizes the observations . the instrumentation , observing protocols , and reduction techniques used were very similar to those described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used a 2048@xmath14 site ccd detector at the f7.5 focus ; each 24 @xmath15 m pixel subtended @xmath16 . at each epoch",
    "we took many exposures in the kron - cousins @xmath17-band , as near to the meridian as we could to minimize differential color refraction ( dcr ) effects @xcite .",
    "there were some differences from the earlier work , namely ( 1 ) we used a 4-inch filter , which allowed us to use the full imaging area of the detector ; and ( 2 ) the chip was oriented with the columns east - west rather than north - south .",
    "the parallax reduction and analysis pipeline was unchanged from the previous work . in the gd362 field , we measured 83 stars , and used 43 of them to define the reference frame .",
    "standardized magnitudes and colors are used in the parallax analysis , to correct for dcr effects and also to estimate the correction from relative to absolute parallax @xcite .",
    "we took images of gd362 in @xmath18 ( as well as the @xmath17 used for astrometry ) on two observing runs ( 2008 june and september ) , and calibrated the instrumental magnitudes from these images with numerous observations of @xcite standard star fields from the same runs .",
    "the photometry of the gd362 field from the two runs agreed within a few hundredths of a magnitude in @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "to arrive at a final distance estimate we use procedures detailed in @xcite .",
    "for gd362 , we measure a proper motion of @xmath20 mas ( milli - arcsec ) yr@xmath21 with an angle @xmath22 , and we find a relative parallax and formal error of @xmath23 mas .",
    "our proper motion measurement is relative to the chosen reference stars , and is not reduced to an absolute reference frame .",
    "corrections to absolute proper motions are generally of order @xmath24 10 mas yr@xmath21 @xcite , and our measurement is consistent with @xmath25 mas yr@xmath21 found by @xcite .",
    "figure 1 displays the trajectory of gd 362 on the sky , and the same trajectory with proper motion component taken out .",
    "this figure shows that our observations cover a large range of parallax factor for gd 362 , and the parallax is well constrained . using the scatter observed among the parallaxes of comparably bright field stars located near the program star we estimate an external error of 1.3 mas .",
    "the magnitudes and colors of the reference stars yield a correction to absolute parallax of 0.9 mas . combining these",
    "gives an absolute parallax and external uncertainty @xmath26 mas , corresponding to @xmath27 pc .",
    "the parallax accuracy is good enough that further corrections have only a small effect on the distance .",
    "nonetheless , the full bayesian formalism described in @xcite adjusts this slightly , to @xmath0 pc .",
    "this formalism includes ( 1 ) the lutz - kelker correction @xcite , which increase the inferred distance to 51.0 pc , and ( 2 ) prior information from the proper motion and very liberal limits on the luminosity , which work to decrease the distance slightly .",
    "our parallax measurement shows that gd 362 is further away , and therefore more luminous and less massive , than predicted from the pure hydrogen atmosphere fits by @xcite .",
    "we now compare our result to the distance implied by the model atmosphere fits by @xcite .",
    "gd 362 is included in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 6 imaging area .",
    "we converted the sdss photometry into the ab system using the offsets given in @xcite .",
    "gd 362 has @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ab mag . using the @xmath30 , @xmath7 g , and mass measurements from @xcite and the model atmospheres from @xcite",
    ", we estimate the theoretical colors for gd 362 and use these to constrain the solid angle @xmath31 , which relates the flux at the surface of the star to that received at earth .",
    "the mass radius relation of @xcite gives a radius of 0.0109 @xmath32 for a 0.73 @xmath3 white dwarf with thin hydrogen layers ( thin layers because gd 362 is helium - rich ) . using this radius ,",
    "the distance for the model atmosphere fit parameters presented in @xcite is 52.2 pc , entirely consistent with our parallax observations .    instead ,",
    "if we use our parallax measurement directly to constrain the radius of the star , we can use the surface gravity and the radius to constrain the mass . replacing the distance in the solid angle @xmath31 with 50.6 pc",
    ", we find a radius of 7.357 @xmath33 cm , or 0.0106 @xmath32 for gd 362 .",
    "using the surface gravity of @xmath7 g = 8.24 , we estimate a mass of 0.71 @xmath3 . again this mass estimate is entirely consistent with the mass estimate of 0.73 @xmath12 0.02 @xmath3 by @xcite .",
    "gd 362 is only slightly more massive than the average mass for the field da ( 0.60 @xmath12 0.13 @xmath3 * ? ? ? * ) and db ( 0.60 @xmath12 0.07 @xmath3 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) white dwarfs .",
    "therefore , there is no evidence of and no need to invoke a binary merger scenario to explain this star and its surrounding debris disk .",
    "the photospheric abundances of metals in gd 362 are also several orders of magnitude different from the nucleosynthetic predictions of a merger event @xcite .",
    "dropping gd 362 from the list of massive stars , there are no known white dwarfs with @xmath34 that host dust disks .",
    "however , massive stars comprise only about 15% of the local white dwarf population @xcite , and only a small number of these stars have been searched for excess infrared radiation from dust disks",
    ". a large survey of massive white dwarfs will be useful to constrain the fraction with debris disks .",
    "using the initial - final mass relations by @xcite , we estimate the progenitor of gd 362 to be a @xmath35 star .",
    "the main sequence lifetime of a solar - metallicity @xmath36 star is 320 - 650 myr , depending on the assumptions on convecting overshooting ( m. h. pinsonneault 2008 , priv .",
    ". the white dwarf cooling age of gd 362 is @xmath11 700 - 800 myr , therefore the total main sequence plus white dwarf age of gd 362 is 1 - 1.5 gyr . using the proper motion and distance",
    ", we estimate that gd 362 has a tangential velocity of 51 km s@xmath21 . including the radial velocity measurement from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* after subtracting the gravitational redshift component ) , we estimate that gd 362 has u , v , and w velocities of 57.7 , 0.5 , and @xmath375.3 km s@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "these velocities are consistent with thin disk membership .",
    "gd 362 seems just like all the other known white dwarfs with debris disks @xcite , except that it has a mixed h / he atmosphere , and it has more metals than the rest of them .",
    "@xcite modelled the mid - infrared spectral energy distribution of gd 362 with a flat disk between 12 and 50 stellar radii and warped disk between 50 and 70 stellar radii . using our radius estimate of 0.0106 @xmath32",
    ", we can convert these numbers into observables .",
    "the dust disk lies between 0.13 and 0.74 @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , based on a distance of 25 pc , the mass of circumstellar dust was estimated to be 3 @xmath38 g. since the real distance to gd 362 is about twice as large , the actual dust mass is four times higher , or @xmath39 g. of course , this is only a tiny fraction of the metals ( @xmath40 g , * ? ? ? * ) present in the convective envelope of the star .",
    "we obtained trigonometric parallax observations of gd 362 over seven epochs separated by 1.3 years .",
    "our direct distance measurement of @xmath0 pc is incompatible with gd 362 being as massive as 1.2@xmath3 . using the parallax to constrain the radius and the mass ,",
    "we find that gd 362 has a mass @xmath11 0.71 @xmath3 .",
    "the model atmosphere analysis presented in @xcite demonstrated that gd 362 has significant amounts of helium in its photosphere and it has @xmath41 .",
    "our parallax observations confirm their result .",
