    "modern society features an increasing degree of interaction between cultures ( `` cultural contact '' ) owing to , e.g. , communication technologies , immigration and other socio - political forces @xcite . in many countries cultural contact",
    "is perceived as both an opportunity and a threat and is related to important public issues such as immigration management and the need to `` protect '' national culture @xcite .",
    "our understanding of these phenomena is , however , limited : we can not predict the outcome of cultural contact , nor make plausible conjectures that can be used in policy making . within this context ,",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold : we first describe a general mathematical framework for modeling social interactions , then we make specific assumptions relevant to studying immigration , i.e. , social contact between two groups that , typically , differ both in culture and relative size .",
    "for simplicity , we focus on a single _ cultural trait _ , which may represent an idea , an opinion or a behavior that has two mutually exclusive forms .",
    "a useful example to keep in mind is being in favor or against an issue such as the death penalty , or any other issue that might be the subject of a yes / no referendum vote .",
    "our framework allows to consider multiple traits without conceptual differences , although model analysis may in general be much more difficult .",
    "we consider a population of @xmath0 individuals , labeled by an index @xmath1 ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath0 .",
    "we associate to the @xmath1-th individual the variable @xmath3 , which may take values @xmath4 or @xmath5 representing the two possible trait values .",
    "for instance , @xmath4 might represent a yes vote in a referendum , and @xmath5 a no vote .",
    "the state of the whole population is thus encoded in an array @xmath6 of @xmath0 numbers , such as @xmath7 .",
    "the hallmark of social interactions is that individuals may change their opinions or behavior owing to interactions with others .",
    "a given couple @xmath8 can in principle be in one of the four states @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , but these outcomes , in general , do not have the same probability .",
    "which one is more likely will depend on the characteristics of individuals such as their culture and personality .",
    "our starting assumption is that individuals have no particular bias towards @xmath4 or @xmath5 opinions : what matters most is whether , by adopting one or the other value , an individual is in agreement or disagreement with others .",
    "there are two reasons for this assumptions .",
    "first , social psychologists have shown that , in most cultures , agreement or disagreement with others is a powerful determinant of individual opinions and behavior , often more important than holding a particular opinion @xcite ; we will expand on this point in our model of immigration below .",
    "second , our framework allows to introduce biases that favor a particular trait value , if needed .",
    "indeed , any model in which individuals are biased can be recast as a model with unbiased individuals , plus an additional `` force '' that orients individual opinions .",
    "thus our starting assumption of unbiased individuals does not reduce the generality of the framework .",
    "again , we will make a specific example for the case of immigration below .    to formalize these notions",
    ", we assume that individuals take on the trait that minimizes a _",
    "cost function_. we define the cost @xmath13 for individual @xmath1 to agree or disagree with individual @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a number that summarizes the nature of the interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath14 , as follows .",
    "when @xmath1 and @xmath14 agree ( @xmath17 ) we have a cost @xmath18 , while when @xmath1 and @xmath14 disagree ( @xmath19 ) we have @xmath20 .",
    "thus whether agreement or disagreement carries the lesser cost depends on the sign of @xmath16 : @xmath21 favors agreement while @xmath22 favors disagreement .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath16 gives how important it is for @xmath1 to agree or disagree with @xmath23 .",
    "if , for instance , @xmath24 then it is more important for @xmath1 to agree with @xmath14 than with @xmath25 , while @xmath26 means that agreement with @xmath14 is not relevant to @xmath1 .",
    "the signs and magnitudes of the @xmath16 s become important when we consider that an individual interacts with many others . in this case , we assume that the costs @xmath13 relative to each interaction sum up to a total cost @xmath27 @xmath28 as anticipated above , we can take into account additional factors that may influence individuals modifying equation ( [ eq : hi ] ) as follows : @xmath29 meaning that individual @xmath1 is subject to an additional `` force '' that favors @xmath30 if @xmath31 and @xmath32 if @xmath33 .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 may represent any factor that is not explicitly taken into account by the direct interaction with other individuals .",
    "for instance , it may summarize the influence of media , government campaigns or existing culture ( see below ) .",
    "we can now write a population - level cost function as the sum of individual cost functions : @xmath35 we stress that the cost function is a theoretical computational aid to track which trait values are favored by the interactions @xmath16 and the external forces @xmath34 .",
    "we do not assume that individuals explicitly compute or are aware of such costs .",
    "rather , @xmath36 should be designed so that its minima correspond to those trait values that are favored by the mechanisms with which individuals interact .",
    "once a cost function has been specified , it is possible to calculate population level quantities such as the average trait value using the methods of statistical mechanics , a branch of theoretical physics .",
    "statistical mechanics was originally concerned with deriving the laws of thermodynamics from the behaviour of atoms and molecules @xcite , but can actually be applied to understand the macroscopic ( population level ) properties of any system composed of many parts that interact according to given microscopic ( individual level ) rules .",
    "more recently its methods have found application in fields as diverse as biology @xcite , neuroscience @xcite , economy and finance @xcite and also social science @xcite .",
    "the starting point is to assign to each system configuration @xmath6 a probability @xmath37 according to the boltzmann - gibbs formula @xcite @xmath38 where the sum runs over all possible configurations of the system .    by means of ( [ eq : bg ] ) a given configuration",
    "is considered more or less likely according to whether it is more or less costly : a low value of @xmath36 results in a high probability of @xmath6 , and vice - versa .",
    "assigning probabilities based on a given cost function is the heart of statistical mechanics and is inspired by the principles of thermodynamics ( see the appendix for a short discussion , and , for a fuller treatment ) .    once a probability is assigned to system configurations , it is possible to compute the expected values of quantities of interest and to relate them to the parameters that describe the system .",
    "for instance the average cultural trait defined by @xmath39 would have an expected value given by @xmath40 note that , while @xmath41 is the average trait value in a given configuration , @xmath42 is the average trait value over all possible system configurations , each one weighted according to its probability of occurrence .",
    "these probabilities depend on the cost function @xmath43 and thus on the parameters that appear in its expression , i.e. , the @xmath16 s and @xmath34 s .    rather than directly attempting to compute",
    "expected values such as ( [ eq : av ] ) , statistical mechanics aims to compute the so - called _ free energy _ of a system , defined as @xmath44 the rationale for this strategy is that important quantities such as ( [ eq : av ] ) can be easily computed from knowledge of the free energy function , typically by taking suitable derivatives with respect to system parameters ( see appendix ) .",
    "the basic task of statistical mechanics is thus , after the cost function @xmath43 has been specified , to calculate the free energy function for a given system .",
    "we stress that _ the form of the cost function is not given by statistical mechanics ; rather , it is the outcome of a modeling effort relative to a specific problem .",
    "_ we now make an example of how one may proceed .",
    "we illustrate here the potentials of our framework considering the impact of immigration on culture .",
    "we consider a large and a small population , which will be referred to , respectively , as _ residents _ ( @xmath45 ) and _ immigrants _ ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "we let @xmath47 be the number of residents , and @xmath48 of immigrants , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 the total number of individuals .",
    "we are interested in how cultural contact changes the average trait values in the two populations , with the aim of understanding the effect of one culture upon the other .",
    "our main assumption regarding how residents and immigrants interact is that people , generally speaking , tend to agree with those who are perceived as similar to oneself and to disagree with those perceived as different . in social psychology",
    "this is known as the _ similarity - attraction _ hypothesis .",
    "it has received ample support , although the details of how we interact with others often depend on social context @xcite .",
    "we consider this assumption a general guideline , and in modeling a specific case it can be modified without difficulty .",
    "we formalize the similarity - attraction hypothesis by assuming that high perceived similarity corresponds to positive values of @xmath16 , and low perceived similarity to negative values .",
    "since residents and immigrants have generally different cultures , we may assume the following structure for the interaction coefficients @xmath16 .",
    "we let the interaction between any two residents be @xmath51 ; the similarity - attraction hypothesis suggests that this be a positive number , whose magnitude reflects how strongly residents prefer to agree among themselves .",
    "likewise , we let the interactions between immigrants be @xmath52 .",
    "the mutual interactions @xmath53 and @xmath54 should model whether residents prefer to agree or disagree with immigrants , and vice - versa , and how strongly so .",
    "if resident and immigrant cultures are very different , the similarity - attraction hypothesis suggests to take both @xmath53 and @xmath54 as negative , but the best choice of values depends on the specific case one intends to model .",
    "note that we are assuming that @xmath16 depends only on population membership and not on the particular individuals @xmath1 and @xmath14 ( the so - called _ mean field _ assumption in statistical mechanics ) .",
    "this assumption greatly simplifies mathematical analysis but is not wholly realistic .",
    "it can capture the average variation in interactions across population but not the variation that exists within each population .",
    "for instance , a more realistic assumption would be to take the @xmath16 s as random variables whose mean and variance depend on population membership .",
    "we plan to return on that model ( which would represent the two - population generalization of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model in statistical mechanics , ) in future studies .",
    "when modeling interactions , a technical requirement is that the value of the cost function be proportional to total population size @xmath0 .",
    "this guarantees that the free - energy function and important quantities such as average trait value , equation ( [ eq : av ] ) , scale appropriately with @xmath0 . in our case",
    "the appropriate scaling is @xmath55 , hence the interactions are : @xmath56      before the two populations start to interact , residents and immigrants are each characterized by a given average trait value , say @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "we consider @xmath59 and @xmath58 as experimental data about the beliefs or behavior of each population , which could be obtained from , say , a referendum vote on a particular issue ( e.g. , the death penalty ) or from statistical sampling of the population .    that a population is characterized by a given average value @xmath60 means that the two forms of the trait are not equally common .",
    "specifically , the individuals with the @xmath4 form are @xmath61 , while @xmath62 individuals have the @xmath5 form .",
    "pre - existing culture , in other words , is like a bias or force that favors one trait value over the other .",
    "for modeling purposes , it is convenient to describe pre - existing culture as a `` cultural force '' that acts to orient the opinion of otherwise unbiased individuals",
    ". this is possible including a force term in the cost function , as shown in ( [ eq : hh ] ) . by standard methods of statistical mechanics ( see appendix ) it is possible to show that the force term corresponding to a particular average opinion @xmath63 is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the inverse hyperbolic tangent function . to summarize , a model in which individuals are biased so that the average opinion is @xmath63 is equivalent to a model with unbiased individuals subject to a force given by ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "so far we have specified interaction terms @xmath16 to model cultural contact between two populations and we have introduced equation ( [ eq : h ] ) to represent the pre - existing culture in the two populations .",
    "the next step is to compute the average trait values @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the two populations after immigration has taken place . the same method that allows to derive equation ( [ eq : h ] ) enables us to derive the following equations for @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( see appendix ) :    [ eq : m1m2 ] @xmath68 @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the fraction of immigrants in the total population and @xmath71 is the hyperbolic tangent function .",
    "the values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 predicted by ( [ eq : m1m2 ] ) depend of course on values of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 parameters , and on @xmath74 .",
    "we give here a qualitative description of the different regimes that one can observe varying these parameters .",
    "we refer to for a proof of the following statements , in the context of an analogous model from condensed matter physics .",
    "the two key parameters are @xmath74 , the fraction of immigrants , and the overall scale of the interactions @xmath16 , which we label @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath72 is below a critical value @xmath75 , equation ( [ eq : m1m2 ] ) has always one pair of solutions , for all values of @xmath74 . in this case",
    "the two populations are essentially merging into a homogeneous one , with average cultural trait in between the two initial ones  more toward one or the other according to the value of @xmath76 .",
    "this regime is not surprising and corresponds to the nave prediction that one could have made a priori without applying statistical mechanics .",
    "if the interaction scale is large ( @xmath77 ) , however , model predictions are highly non - trivial , suggesting that the outcome of cultural contact can be surprising . depending on @xmath72 there are two critical values for @xmath76 : @xmath78 and @xmath79 that delimit qualitatively different behavior . for @xmath80",
    "the resident culture dominates dominant and the immigrant culture disappears , i.e. , @xmath67 is close to @xmath66 irrespective of the initial value @xmath81 .",
    "the converse happens when @xmath82 , i.e. , immigrant culture dominates .",
    "the most interesting case occurs when @xmath83 . in this regime ( [ eq : m1m2 ] ) has two distinct solutions in which either of the two cultures dominates .",
    "that is , both cultures may survive the immigration process , generally with a different probability determined by system parameters .",
    "the parameter values that favor the resident or immigrant culture , have still to be worked out and will be the topic of future work . here",
    "we analyze the case in which the intensity of the interactions is uniform both within and between groups , @xmath84 .",
    "this is interpreted as two groups that do not really discriminate between themselves , so that disagreement with any particular individual carries the same cost independent of which group the individual belongs to .",
    "we assume , however , that the two groups have initially a very different average trait value : @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in figure",
    "[ fig : jalpha ] we explore this system by plotting the average trait value after the interaction , @xmath87 , for @xmath74 between 0 and 10% and for @xmath88 . for @xmath89 ( no interaction )",
    "@xmath25 is simply the weighted sum of pre - existing trait values , @xmath90 , where each group contributes according to its size . as a function of @xmath74",
    ", this is a straight line .",
    "as the interaction increases the line slowly bends and for higher values of @xmath76 we see a slight exaggeration of the pre - existing opinion @xmath91 ( the surface in figure  [ fig : jalpha ] rises slightly over the level @xmath92 ) .",
    "when @xmath72 crosses a critical value @xmath93 , however , a dramatic phenomenon occurs : the population undergoes a sudden change of opinion , switching to a value of @xmath25 that is closer to , and indeed exaggerates , the initial value in the immigrant population , @xmath94 .",
    "note that this sudden transition occurs for all values of @xmath76 , i.e. , irrespective of the proportion of immigrants .",
    "the solution with @xmath25 closer to @xmath66 is still available to the system ( not plotted in figure[fig : jalpha ] ) , but as @xmath72 grows past @xmath75 it is less and less likely that the system remains in such state ( technically , for @xmath95 the solution with @xmath96 has a higher free - energy than the solution with @xmath97 and thus becomes metastable , allowing fluctuations to cause a transition between the two solutions ) .",
    "thus , according to this model , to prevent dramatic changes in resident culture , it would do little to restrict immigration ( the effect of @xmath74 is small in the graph ) .",
    "rather , one should concentrate in reducing the scale of the interaction @xmath72 , i.e. , the strength of attitudes within and between groups .",
    "attempts to apply mathematical - physics methods to social sciences have appeared in the litterature since the pioneering work of . in this paper",
    "we have focused on statistical mechanics as a tool to bridge the gap from individual - level psychology and behavior to population - level outcomes .",
    "our framework prescribes that researchers build a cost function that embodies knowledge of what trait values ( opinions , behaviors , etc . )",
    "are favored by individual interactions under given social conditions . the cost function , equation ( [ eq : h ] ) ,",
    "is defined by a choice for the interactions @xmath16 and the fields @xmath34 that represent social forces influencing individual opinions and behavior .",
    "this modeling effort , of course , requires specific knowledge of the social issue to be modeled .",
    "after a cost function has been specified , the machinery of statistical mechanics can be used to compute population - level quantities and study how they depend on system parameters .",
    "we have demonstrated our framework with an attempt to understand the possible outcomes of contact between two cultures .",
    "even the simple case we studied in some detail the model suggests that cultural contact may have dramatic outcomes ( figure [ fig : jalpha ] ) . how to tailor our framework to specific cases , and what scenarios such models predict , is open to future research .",
