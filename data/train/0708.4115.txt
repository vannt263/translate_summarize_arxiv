    "in a disintegration scenario , the products drop out of equilibrium roughly when their interaction rate falls below the expansion rate . a thermal freeze - out",
    "is commonly defined as occurring when scattering processes cease to be effective in redistributing the particle momenta . from that time on , apart from sequential decays , only the long - range coulomb forces continue to modify the otherwise frozen momenta of the disintegration products .",
    "observables depending on the relative momenta , such as two - particle correlation functions , are sensitive to the source properties at the thermal freeze - out time @xcite .",
    "the relative population of two - particle resonances , in an equilibrium situation , will therefore reflect the temperature at that stage @xcite .",
    "chemical freeze - out , on the other hand , is reached once the partitioning into particles and fragments is completed , and mutual scatterings are no longer sufficiently energetic to significantly modify the channel composition by transfer , breakup or capture - type processes .",
    "the statistical multifragmentation models assume global equilibrium and thus coinciding thermal and chemical freeze - out times @xcite .",
    "the question to what extent this is found to be realized in nuclear fragmentation reactions has been addressed by several groups .",
    "for example , by explicitly taking into account the effects of sequential decay , huang et al . were able to demonstrate that in central @xmath3au on @xmath3au collisions at 35 mev per nucleon the temperatures of the thermal and chemical freeze - out stages are @xmath4 4.3 mev and identical to within 200 kev @xcite .",
    "a similar observation had earlier been made for @xmath5ar on @xmath3au at the same energy per nucleon @xcite .    in the central @xmath3au on @xmath3au reactions , however , when the bombarding energy is increased , temperatures derived from the population of two - particle resonances and from double ratios of isotopic yields start to diverge significantly @xcite .",
    "the excited - state temperatures saturate at values near @xmath6 = 5 mev while the isotope temperatures increase to more than 10 mev at 200 mev per nucleon , the latter behavior being more in line with what is expected from the increasing system excitation .",
    "differences of similar magnitude have also been reported for @xmath7kr on @xmath8nb reactions , studied at incident energies up to 120 mev per nucleon @xcite .",
    "calculations showed that sequential decay should alter the two types of temperatures in a coherent fashion and , therefore , can not account for the observed effect @xcite .",
    "the divergence of isotope and excited - state temperatures in central @xmath3au on @xmath3au collisions develops at bombarding energies at which collective radial flow becomes a significant part of the kinetic energies of light particles and fragments @xcite .",
    "this coincidence was interpreted as indicating a connection with the loss of global equilibrium resulting from the collective expansion .",
    "radial expansion is accompanied by a local cooling which favors cluster formation by coalescence @xcite , as also demonstrated with nuclear molecular dynamics calculations @xcite , a process terminated by the rapid rarefaction of the outstreaming material . in this non - equilibrium scenario ,",
    "the higher temperatures of earlier reaction stages may thus manifest themselves not only in the higher kinetic energies of the fragments but also in partitions representing higher chemical temperatures .",
    "it will be shown in this work that a saturation of excited - state temperatures , while the isotope temperatures rise to higher values , is also observed in spectator fragmentations in which flow effects are less prominent @xcite .",
    "the divergence starts when the residue formation prevailing at lower excitation energies gives way to the multiple production of intermediate - mass fragments as more energy is deposited in the spectator system .",
    "this suggests that it is the more general condition of a bulk breakup , independent of the magnitude of the collective motion accompanying it , which leads to a separation between the chemical and thermal freeze - outs .",
    "apart from this main conclusion , the paper is also meant to provide a summary of different temperature measurements performed for spectator decays , here specifically for collisions of @xmath3au nuclei at incident energies of 600 and 1000 mev per nucleon .",
    "some of the results are already published @xcite .",
    "questions addressed in the following , but not necessarily discussed exhaustively , include the @xmath9-scaling of spectator decays , the validity of the chemical freeze - out picture , the reliability of sequential - decay corrections , and the magnitude of the internal fragment excitation .",
    "the temperature measurements reported here were performed in two experiments devoted to spectator decays following collisions of @xmath3au projectiles with a variety of targets ranging from c to au at bombarding energies of 600 and 1000 mev per nucleon . in the first experiment ,",
    "the aladin spectrometer was used to detect and identify the products of the projectile - spectator decay @xcite .",
    "the masses of light fragments were determined by measuring their charge , magnetic - rigidity and velocity . in the second experiment which concentrated on the @xmath3au on @xmath3au system at 1000 mev per nucleon ,",
    "the target - spectator decay was studied at backward angles with two multi - detector hodoscopes covering the angular range @xmath10 and with three high - resolution telescopes placed at @xmath11 , and 150@xmath12 .",
    "these detectors were used to measure the yields and correlations of isotopically resolved light charged particles and fragments .",
    "the hodoscopes consisted of a total of 160 si - csi(tl ) telescopes in closely - packed geometry while the telescopes each consisted of three si detectors with thickness 50 , 300 , and 1000 @xmath13 m and of a 4-cm long csi(tl ) scintillator with photodiode readout .",

    "it reflects the variation of the charge of the primary spectator system and is monotonically correlated with the impact parameter of the reaction @xcite . in the second experiment , when the decay of the target spectator was studied , the impact - parameter selection with the @xmath9 of the projectile took advantage of the symmetry of the @xmath3au on @xmath3au system @xcite .",

    "in addition , correlated yields of p - t , p-@xmath20li , and @xmath16he-@xmath16he coincidences and @xmath16he single yields were used to deduce temperatures from the relative populations of states or groups of states in @xmath16he ( g.s . ; 21.21 mev and higher ) and in @xmath18be ( 3.04 mev ; 17.64 and 18.15 mev ) .",

    "they are between 11 and 19 mev and thus fulfill the requirement that this quantity should be large compared to the anticipated temperatures @xcite .",

    "of these only the @xmath21 temperature exhibited a rise with the bombarding energy which suggested the conclusion that differences in the production environment of @xmath19he may be responsible for the singular behavior of @xmath21 .",
    "while this can not explain the common behavior of @xmath46 and @xmath21 observed in this work , it also points toward a more general scenario of different freeze - out conditions for different products , possibly also connected with the cooling prior to and during the freeze - out process  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to central collisions of symmetric systems , there is no strong indication of collective radial flow in spectator decays , neither in the mass dependence of the kinetic energies of particles and fragments @xcite nor in their absolute magnitude @xcite , as discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "therefore , if the different behavior of the excited - state and isotope temperatures for light fragments is assumed to have a common cause in both types of reactions , the collective flow by itself is not a very likely candidate for it .",
    "a more general common property of the two types of reactions is the disintegration of the whole system into many fragments and particles as the collisions become more violent .",
    "the maximum multiplicities of intermediate - mass fragments , after normalization with respect to the mass of the system , are of similar magnitude in central @xmath3au on @xmath3au collisions at 100 mev per nucleon and in the spectator decays discussed here @xcite .",
    "a rise of the temperature with decreasing @xmath9 can be expected because the collisions become more violent .",
    "the fragment mass spectra change rapidly and become increasingly steep @xcite .",

    "the neutron energies measured with land were taken as representative also for the proton kinetic energies in this analysis .",
    "preequilibrium nucleons from earlier reaction stages , apparently , contribute at the highest excitation energies which , therefore , have to be considered as upper limits .",
    "lower excitation energies , consistent with the invariance of the fragment decays with respect to the incident energy , were obtained from the analysis with the statistical multifragmentation model with input parameters derived from the fragment observables alone @xcite . in this so - called backtracing procedure ( see also refs .",

    "the predicted plateau of the breakup temperature @xmath88  mev for excitation energies between 4 and about 8 mev is thus consistent with the observed smooth rise of the chemical temperatures of light fragments in this interval .    in these calculations ,",
    "the channels with smaller @xmath9 are populated by the decay of spectator sources of smaller mass and higher excitation , in accordance with the geometrical participant - spectator scenario .",
    "the rise of the breakup temperature with decreasing @xmath9 , in this way , translates into a mass dependence which is found to be rather generally obeyed in multifragment decays @xcite . in data from several experiments ,",
    "temperatures @xmath88  mev are associated with heavy systems of mass @xmath89 while higher temperatures up to @xmath90  mev are observed for lighter systems with @xmath91 .",
    "the steady rise of the temperature with excitation energy for the very small systems has even been interpreted as indicating a breakup at conditions close to the critical point @xcite .",
    "this systematic dependence has been associated with the concept of the limiting temperature at which excited homogeneous systems become unbound @xcite . according to these finite - temperature hartree - fock calculations ,",
    "the limiting temperature should not only depend on the mass of the system but , because of the changing coulomb pressure , also on its isotopic composition .",
    "this prediction , however , has so far not been confirmed experimentally . the @xmath21 temperatures for target spectator decays initiated by @xmath55c projectiles of 300 and 600 mev per nucleon on @xmath92sn and @xmath93sn targets differ by not more than 0.5 mev for similarly violent collisions @xcite , while a difference of about 1.5 mev would be expected according to the calculations @xcite .",
    "however , in accordance with the predictions , the more proton - rich @xmath92sn system exhibits the lower temperature on average .",
    "= 7.0 cm      the measured excited - state temperatures of 5 to 6 mev reflecting the internal excitation of the observed he , li and be isotopes are in good agreement with other measurements performed with the same method and for reaction channels characterized by multiple fragment production  @xcite .",
    "higher temperatures of 7 to 9 mev have been reported for excited @xmath94li fragments in @xmath95n on @xmath3au reactions at 35 mev per nucleon after selecting the d-@xmath75 pairs with the highest pair momenta while typical temperatures were 3 to 5 mev also for this reaction  @xcite .",
    "lower temperature values measured in compound reactions were found to be of the expected magnitude which confirms the sensitivity of the excited - state populations to the thermal characteristics of the reaction process @xcite .",
    "the internal excitation of heavier fragments at freeze - out in reactions at intermediate energies has been studied by measuring the correlations between light particles and fragments @xcite . for the reaction @xmath93xe on sn at 50 mev per nucleon",
    ", the excitation energies of fragments over a wide range of @xmath36 have been found to saturate at @xmath96  mev @xcite while a slightly lower value of 2.5 mev has been reported for central @xmath97kr on @xmath8nb at 45 mev @xcite ( for a review , see ref .",
    "the corresponding temperatures of not more than 5 mev compare well with the present results and confirm their universal character as representing the internal excitation in fragment emissions . translated into time scales of evaporation processes , temperatures between 4 and 6 mev correspond rather generally to nuclear life times of the order of 50 to 200 fm / c @xcite which cover the range of time scales deduced for fragmentation reactions  @xcite .",
    "these experimental methods probe the excitation of the fragments when they are sufficiently separated from the rest of the system , so that the correlations of the decay products are not disturbed by further collisions .",
    "similarly , the particle - unstable resonances will have to acquire their asymptotic quantum structure before they can be recognized .",
    "this is not likely to occur as long as they are connected to the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "the typical widths of about 1 mev define very similar time scales of the order of 200 fm / c for their formation and decay .",
    "the obtained temperatures thus refer to a late stage in the reaction process whereas the chemical temperatures may reflect properties of earlier stages at which the fragments are still in contact and their chemical compositions are still being established . in a disintegration scenario associated with cooling , an observed difference of these temperatures does not necessarily rule out that the two degrees of freedom are in equilibrium up to the time when one of them freezes out ( cf . refs .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", molecular dynamics calculations consistently predict differences between the internal product temperatures and those of the surrounding environment . according to quantum molecular dynamics calculations for the @xmath3au on @xmath3au reaction between 60 and 150 mev per nucleon , the relative motion of the constituents of asymptotically identified light fragments ,",
    "e.g. @xmath98 , corresponds to a nearly constant @xmath99  mev during most of the reaction time up to 200 fm / c @xcite .",
    "the environment , at the same time , cools from about 15 mev to temperatures much below 5 mev .",
    "also in classical molecular dynamics calculations , the internal temperatures evolve differently from those of the hot environment @xcite",
    ".    these arguments may be sufficient to conclude that differences between the temperatures representing the chemical composition of the fragments and the internal excitation after their release have to be expected .",
    "the observed saturation of the latter may , in fact , represent another and rather obvious evidence for the existence of a limit up to which a nucleus can be excited @xcite . in the case of surface emissions from hot residues , this limit is evidently not yet reached by the system itself which then can act as the heat reservoir determining both , the composition and internal excitation of the fragments . when the system becomes unstable with respect to bulk disintegration at higher excitations",
    ", composite products will still have to obey this limit in order to be recognized as such entities in the final partitions .",
    "it is , nevertheless , a rather intriguing result that internal temperatures of 5 mev are universally observed in the fragmentation channels throughout the wide range of reactions covered by the many experiments , including , e.g. , also the measurement of bremsstrahlung photons  @xcite .",
    "the question arises whether this would have to be directly connected to the process of fragment formation in order to exhibit this generality .",
    "the problems associated with predicting internal fragment excitations at freeze - out in an expansion scenario have been recognized early on @xcite after the first data on excited - state temperatures had become available @xcite .",
    "values near @xmath99  mev have been very consistently obtained even though remarkably different theoretical approaches were followed .",
    "the presented reasons are numerous and of different origin as , e.g. , coalescence heating @xcite or the onset of instabilities @xcite .    a mechanism leading to invariant internal excitations is also constituted by the goldhaber model @xcite which has been found to provide a basis for the understanding of the fragment kinetic energies in reactions at relativistic and also intermediate energies @xcite .",
    "as an example , the clusterization mechanism proposed for the production of fragments of mass number @xmath100 in peripheral collisions at intermediate energies involves a random picking of @xmath100 nucleons from a cold fermi sphere @xcite .",
    "their momenta in the center - of - mass system of the formed fragment correspond to those of an excited system .",
    "this has been tested by fitting finite - temperature fermi distributions to the mean momentum distributions obtained with a monte carlo procedure following this prescription .",
    "the resulting temperatures drop , approximately like @xmath101 , from about 7 mev for @xmath102 to smaller values for larger clusters @xcite . for intermediate - mass fragments , this is of the order of magnitude that is observed .",
    "more importantly , this mechanism is fairly independent of the global course of the reaction and of the excitation of the emitting system .",
    "a summary has been presented of a series of temperature measurements for spectator decays following the excitation of @xmath3au nuclei in relativistic collisions at energies up to 1 gev per nucleon .",
    "the methods used permit the determination of the temperature representing the assumed thermal population of the considered degrees of freedom .",
    "they are model independent except for the assessment of the effects of sequential decay which , however , are important , in particular for temperatures derived from double isotope - yield ratios . kinetic energies and the kinetic temperatures associated with them were only briefly addressed . rather than collective motion ,",
    "the fermi motion of nucleons in the colliding nuclei are evidently responsible for their high values which considerably exceed the thermal and chemical breakup temperatures in the reactions studied here .",
    "the main observation derived from the data and discussed in detail is the divergence of the isotope and excited - state temperatures with increasing excitation of the spectator system . the chemical and thermal freeze - outs cease to coincide if bulk disintegrations of major parts of the excited intermediate system start to become important , i.e. , at the point of transition from residue formation to multifragment production .",
    "the higher values of temperatures derived from double - isotope ratios suggest that the chemical compositions are established prior to the thermal freeze - out stage when the products finally disconnect from the system .",
    "the thermal freeze - out temperatures deduced from excited - state populations of particle - unstable resonances saturate around @xmath6 = 5 mev , a value common to several classes of fragmentation reactions .",
    "in particular , the patterns observed in explosive fragmentations following central collisions of heavy systems and in the largely equilibrated spectator decays studied here are rather similar .",
    "the chemical freeze - out temperatures have characteristic properties in common with the partitions themselves as , e.g. , the invariance properties of @xmath9-sorted observables . here",
    ", the invariance with respect to the mass of the collision partner and the invariance with the bombarding energy in the studied range of 600 to 1000 mev per nucleon have been explicitly demonstrated .",
    "as a new result , it is found that the @xmath46 thermometer based on fragments with @xmath50 follows the results obtained with the frequently used @xmath21 thermometer .",
    "also the single ratios of isotope yields exhibit the @xmath9 dependence that is expected from the binding - energy difference in chemical equilibrium . only the double ratios containing carbon isotopes do not consistently support the general trend to higher temperatures at smaller @xmath9 . with the present data , it has not been possible to firmly resolve whether this is caused by nuclear - structure effects in particular combinations of isotopes or whether , more likely , it indicates some restriction in the validity of a concept of global chemical equilibrium at breakup .",
    "heavier products , unable to survive in very hot environments , can only come from cooler regions of the system .",
    "the uncertainty of secondary - decay corrections remains the limiting factor in the quantitative analysis .",
    "the corrections are well under control at the lower temperatures of up to about 4 mev and , in particular , in the case of emissions from excited residue nuclei .",
    "the uncertainties increase with the temperature and approach the mev order of magnitude once typical breakup temperatures of 6 mev are reached or exceeded .",
    "this was illustrated by comparing several different correction methods .",
    "while it is highly desirable to improve this situation , it has , nevertheless , been possible to establish important trends , in good agreement with results from other experiments .",
    "a remaining open problem is constituted by the somewhat unclear role of limiting temperatures which seem to influence the internal fragment excitations but not the dependence of the chemical temperatures on the isotopic composition of the system , at least not in the predicted magnitude .",
