    "dusty plasmas play an important role in planetary as well as in astrophysical systems @xcite",
    ". however , many prominent astrophysical environments in which dusty plasmas can be found are highly energetic and strongly magnetized , such as supernovae , neutron stars , and young stellar objects ( yso ) .",
    "there are important new wave modes is such dusty plasmas @xcite , and the dust grain speeds may even become relativistic @xcite .",
    "supernovae , in which extreme energy scales are reached , allow for many exotic phenomena .",
    "in these violent events , neutron stars , yso and pulsars are formed .",
    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is an indispensable explanatory model for much of the observed phenomena around these highly condensed objects .",
    "scattering of photons off photons is predicted by qed , and it can be a prominent component of pulsar physics , since pulsars offer the necessary energy scales for such scattering to occur .",
    "related to the scattering of photons is the concept of photon splitting in strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that this effect could be important in explaining the radio silence of magnetars @xcite .",
    "moreover , the propagation of intense electromagnetic waves in plasmas gives rise to many interesting phenomena @xcite .",
    "the existence of new plasma modes due to qed effects has been noted recently @xcite . in the present letter",
    ", we point out the existence of a different electromagnetic wave that may exist due to the interaction of charged dust and photons with the nonlinear quantum vacuum .",
    "first , let us consider the classical propagation of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave in a multi - component plasma embedded in an external magnetic field @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the strength of the external magnetic field and @xmath2 is the unit vector along the @xmath3 axis .",
    "the dispersion relation for a circularly polarized wave with frequency @xmath4 and wavevector @xmath5 is then given by ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) @xmath6 where the sum is over all particle species @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the gyrofrequency and plasma frequency , respectively , @xmath10 is the relativistic gamma factor of species @xmath7 , and the upper ( lower ) sign in the denominator corresponds to left ( right ) hand polarization . here , @xmath11 denotes particle density in the laboratory frame , @xmath12 charge , @xmath13 particle rest mass , and @xmath14 the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the plasma is assumed to consist of an admixture of electrons ( @xmath15 ) , positrons ( @xmath16 ) , ions ( @xmath17 ) , and charged dust particles ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we note that the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disprel ] ) has been derived without applying the usual small amplitude linearization . for a given @xmath19 ,",
    "the polarization is determined by the sign of @xmath4 . in the background state ,",
    "the plasma is close to equilibrium , and we have approximate charge neutrality , @xmath20 .",
    "thus , for strongly magnetized relativistic electrons , positrons and ions , a low - frequency ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) wave will satisfy the dispersion relation @xmath23 which is appropriate for large amplitude electromagnetic waves in supernova . here , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ^ 2 } , \\ ] ] gives the relativistic gamma factor for dust with charge @xmath26 , where @xmath15 is the magnitude of the electron charge .",
    "henceforth we will allow @xmath27 , thus incorporating the left hand polarization as negative frequencies , and removing the @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : classical ] ) .    next , we investigate the effects of the nonlinear quantum vacuum on the dispersion relation ( [ eq : classical ] ) of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave in a dusty magnetoplasma .",

    "for right - hand circularly polarized electromagnetic waves propagating in a magnetized cold dusty pair - ion plasma , the matter effects can be absorbed in the wave operator on the left - hand side by the replacement @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the plasma dispersion function , given by ( see , e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite , and eq .  ( [ eq : classical ] ) ) @xmath48 we stress that the application of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) requires field strengths smaller than the schwinger critical field @xmath49",

    "\\label{eq : transverse2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : transverse2 ] ) is the main result of our calculations .",
    "due to their large mass , the dust particles can under most circumstances be considered non - relativistic , i.e.  @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we note the following for the dispersion relation ( [ eq : transverse2 ] ) : in the classical case , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : classical ] ) we must have @xmath52 . this requirement is obviously not necessary for the qed case , where @xmath53 is allowed .",
    "thus , new low frequency waves are expected in the strong field regime .",
    "in order to gain a better understanding of the dispersion relation ( [ eq : transverse2 ] ) we introduce the dimensionless variables and parameters @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the dispersion relation ( [ eq : transverse2 ] ) then reads @xmath59\\left(\\frac{k}{\\omega}\\right)^2 + \\frac{\\gamma_d}{1            - \\omega\\gamma_d } , \\ ] ] where the relativistic gamma factor can be found from the relation @xmath60    we may now discern between the following cases :    \\(a ) @xmath61 : if we let @xmath62 , i.e. neglect the qed correction , we only have mode propagation for @xmath63 . when @xmath64 , this is no longer a necessary condition for mode propagation , and we can therefore have @xmath65 .",
    "a special case here is the strongly magnetized dusty plasma , @xmath66 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : transverse2 ] ) then yields @xmath67 for which the qed effects act only as a small correction .",
    "\\(b ) @xmath68 : from eqs .",

    "( [ eq : new1 ] ) has new branches which is not present in the classical theory .",
    "moreover , it will be further pronounced for low frequency waves , and we therefore expect the qed effects to play an important role in the propagation of such modes . in the limit of large @xmath72 , i.e.   weak external magnetic field @xmath1 , we can simplify the dispersion relation to @xmath73 in order to further elucidate the character of the new qed mode . in the limit @xmath62",
    ", we obtain the whistler - like dispersion relation @xmath74 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in astrophysical environments , such as supernovae , it is believed that charged dust grains can affect the plasma dynamics in crucial ways @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that supernovae can be a significant source of dust particles @xcite , although this claim is under debate @xcite . at the same time",
    "the plasma may be highly magnetized , thus altering the behavior of the dusty plasma significantly @xcite .",
    "in fact , the fields can reach amplitudes such that the vacuum will be excited , making it nonlinear due to qed effects . in this perspective , it is thus natural that the mode structure presented here is more complex than that of linear theory . in fig .  1",
    ", we have plotted the dispersion curves , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : new2 ] ) , for different values of the qed parameter @xmath75 .",
    "we note that for @xmath76 larger than a critical value ( which depends on @xmath75 ) , there are three branches of the dispersion relation ( [ eq : new2 ] ) , in contrast to the single branch present in the classical limit .",
    "it should be stressed that the values of @xmath75 used in fig .",
    "1 by no means require unrealistic astrophysical conditions , as the following example will show : in interstellar clouds , the dust density is expected to be @xmath77 @xcite , with a typical dust mass @xmath78 @xcite . for the circularly polarized wave ,",
    "we take the amplitude to satisfy @xmath79 , a value appropriate at a distance of 1au from a supernova . in this case , a value @xmath80 ( well within the limits for such environments ) results in @xmath81 . for higher dust mass densities we note that even lower wave intensities will give values of @xmath75 close to one .",
    "such dense dusty plasmas are likely to be found closer to the core of a supernova remnant .",
    "it should also be noted that we have neglected radiative - resonant interactions on our new electromagnetic wave mode .",
    "however , in many cases such interactions can dominate @xcite , thus altering the behavior of the mode .",
    "this is a phenomenon that has to be considered in future research .",
    "in addition , an important problem of the physics of supernova explosions is the relation between the layer of dust behind the supernova shock and the process of dust - wave condensation behind the shock wave front @xcite",
    ". our new nonlinear wave mode may thus play a role from the viewpoint of supernova shock propagation .",
    "we have presented an analysis regarding the propagation of intense circularly polarized waves in a magnetized dusty plasma .",
    "it is found that corrections due to qed modify the mode structure , giving rise to novel low frequency waves with no classical counterpart .",
    "our main result is the dispersion relation ( [ eq : transverse2 ] ) , in which the effects of charged dust and qed are taken into account .",
    "the result should be of interest in astrophysical environments , such as supernova remnants and interstellar clouds .",
