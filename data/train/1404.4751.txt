    "the material is a monolayer of carbon crystal forming a two dimensional hexagonal geometric lattice @xcite .",
    "energy spectrum of this material has a particular structure where the valence and the conduction bands intersect at dirac points producing a semi - metal . in this way",
    ", low - energy excitations are described by a pair of two - component fermions , equivalently , a four - component dirac fermion @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been many attempts to bluid a bridge between high energy physics and the graphene using different methods including the btz black hole physics and the ads / cft correspondence explored in string theory and related topics@xcite .",
    "more precisely , a stringy description in terms of the ( d3,d7 ) brane system embedded in type iib superstring has been proposed in @xcite . in the corresponding brane representation ,",
    "each d3-d7 pair produces a complex massless two - component spinor living in the three dimensional space - time . in connection with these activities , a brane realization of the quantum hall effect , based on the calabi - yau singularities classified by lie symmetries ,",
    "has been proposed in @xcite . in particular , it has been suggested a possible link between the graphene and a special class of lie symmetries called indefinite .",
    "more recently , lie symmetries has been used to investigate a class of materials engineered from the hexagonal structure .",
    "it is recalled that this geometry can be considered as the most stable one in nature which has been explored in many physical applications , including particle physics , string theory and nano - technology .",
    "indeed , an experimental treatment on the hexagonal materials by the scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) has been elaborated producing a @xmath3 supercell configuration on the graphene and the silicene surfaces , in contrast to the usual structure known by the ( 1@xmath41 ) geometry@xcite .",
    "a close inspection in rank two lie symmetries has showed that the @xmath3 structure appears naturally in the construction of the root system of the @xmath1 exceptional lie symmetry @xcite .",
    "based on this observation , a combination of @xmath3 and @xmath5 geometries has been developed to engineer new materials relaying on a double hexagonal structure arising in the root system of the @xmath1 lie symmetry @xcite .    motivated by",
    "the above works , we establish a correspondence between 2d material physics and lie symmetries . in this way",
    ", we interpret the material unit cells as root systems of lie symmetries .",
    "this may offer a new take on the geometrical elaboration of 2d materials .",
    "our focus is on rank two lie symmetries . in particular , we consider the hexagonal structure , and we find that it is linked to @xmath0 and @xmath1 root systems .",
    "this method can be applied to lie supersymmetries associated with fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "we expect that this class of symmetries can offer a new way to approach doping material geometries .",
    "supported by the role placed by lie symmetries in high energy physics , we speculate on a possible connection with @xmath2 brane webs used in the string theory compactification on toric calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a short overview on lie symmetries .",
    "section 3 concerns a dictionary between the root systems of rank two lie symmetries and 2d material physics .",
    "extension to lie supersymmetries is discussed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 contains concluding remarks and a speculation from string theory .",
    "we start by recalling that symmetry is one of the most important ingredient in physics .",
    "precisely , one remarks the crucial role placed by lie symmetries in standard model and higher dimensional physical models including superstrings , m and f - theories . in this way",
    ", the root systems have been explored to partially solve many problems arising in such theories . a particular emphasis put on the hexagonal geometry appearing in lie symmetries used in string theory compactification .",
    "it has been analyzed that many geometrical background relevant to particle physics and string theory are associated with the hexagonal symmetries appearing in the root systems @xcite .",
    "the hexagonal structure arises also in lower dimensional theories including solid state physics dealing with the graphene - like models . in the investigation of such materials",
    ", it has been found the appearance of new structures shearing similarities with the hexagonal root systems of lie symmetries @xcite .",
    "armed by these works , we establish a dictionary between lie symmetries and 2d material physics . before going ahead ,",
    "let us note that the present study assumes some basic knowledge on lie symmetries and their root systems@xcite .",
    "more precisely , we give a flash review on such mathematical backgrounds , used in many physical area including high energy and condensed matter physics .",
    "indeed , a lie symmetry @xmath6 is a vector space together with an antisymmetric bilinear bracket @xmath7 : g \\times   g \\to g$ ] satisfying the jacobi identity ( @xmath8 + [ c , [ a , b ] ] + [ b , [ c , a ] ] = 0 $ ] ) .",
    "it is realized that any semi - simple lie symmetry can be viewed as a direct sum of simple lie symmetries .",
    "the cartan subalgebra @xmath9 is generated by the all semi - simple elements , being the maximal abelian lie sub - algebra .",
    "it is observed that @xmath6 may then be written as the direct sum of @xmath9 and the subspaces @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12=\\alpha(x)x\\}$ ] for @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 ranges over all elements of the dual of @xmath9 . in lie theory ,",
    "these vectors @xmath14 are called roots .    having discussed the lie structure , we now recall some basic concepts of the root systems which will be explored later on in the discussion of the desired correspondence . following @xcite , a root system @xmath15 of a lie symmetry",
    "is defined as a subset of an euclidean space @xmath16 satisfying the following constraints :    1 .",
    "@xmath15 is finite and spans @xmath16 , @xmath17 is an element of @xmath18 2 .",
    "if @xmath14 is an element of @xmath18 , then @xmath19 is also but only for @xmath20 3 .   for any @xmath21 in @xmath15",
    ", @xmath22 is invariant under reflection @xmath23 , where @xmath24 4 .",
    "if @xmath25 et @xmath26 are two elements of @xmath15 , the quantity @xmath27    note by the way that the root system @xmath15 contains several information about the associated lie symmetry structure",
    ". these information will be relevant in the present discussion . in lie theory",
    ", it has been shown that there is a nice classification of rank two lie symmetries .",
    "taking two root elements @xmath25 and @xmath26 of @xmath15 , it is evident to show the equation @xmath28where @xmath29 is the angle between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to the following constraint @xmath30the possible values of @xmath29 are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , leading to a nice classification .",
    "this generates four different lie symmetries with the following dimensions @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the number of the roots associated with @xmath6 . the number 2",
    "is called the rank identified with the number of the simple roots , being the dimension of the corresponding cartan subalgebra .",
    "these four symmetries , classified in terms of the angle between simple roots @xmath35 , are listed in table 1 .",
    ".classification of the rank two lie symmetries in terms of @xmath35 angle [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]",
    "on the basis of the above correspondence , it is natural to think about models based on other lie symmetries . in this section ,",
    "we consider the lie supersymmeries associated with fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "these symmetries have been explored in many context in physics and can be thought as a possible extension of the one discussed in the previous section @xcite .",
    "in fact , we expect that lie supersymmeries can be used to engineer a new class of materials .",
    "this may support the physical application of these symmetries not only in string theory and related models but also in nano - science technology .    in higher dimensional theories",
    ", there are many examples of such lie symmetries .",
    "the general study is beyond the scope of the present work , though we will consider an explicit example a(1,0 ) which can be thought of as a particular extension of the @xmath0 lie bosonic symmetry .",
    "this symmetry which has been developed to study aspects of supersymmetric integrable conformal models is quite similar to @xmath0 but with some differences .",
    "it is an eight dimensional lie symmetry with rank 2 .",
    "the corresponding root system has been extensively studied involving fermmionic and bosonic roots .",
    "in fact , it is shown that this symmetry involves two different root systems .",
    "the first one has two fermionic nonzero roots @xmath36 and @xmath37 having a length square zero , and a normalized bosonic nonzero root @xmath38 with a length square 2 . in this case , the total root system is given by @xmath39 .",
    "the second root system involves one fermionic simple nonzero root @xmath36 having length square zero and a simple bosonic root @xmath40 with length square 2 .",
    "the normalized fermionic one nonzero root with length square 0 is @xmath41 .",
    "the total root system is given by @xmath42 .",
    "it has been shown that both of them has a hexagonal geometry involving fermionic and bosonic roots .",
    "this indicates that the theory of lie superalgebras differs from the theory of lie symmetries .",
    "this difference in nature of roots drives us to think that such symmetries could be associated with magnetic doping hexagonal materials . in the study",
    "graphene interacting with metal atoms , it has been observed that there are three adsorption sites named by hollow h , bridge b and top t. in fact , the hollow h site is placed at the center of a hexagon . in connection with lie symmetries ,",
    "these sites should be associated with zero roots corresponding to the cartan sub - algebras .",
    "the bridge b site is located at the midpoint of a carbon - carbon bond .",
    "indeed , this can be associated with the length of simple roots via the the generalized pythagorean theorem .",
    "however , the top t site is placed directly above a carbon atom .",
    "considering atoms preferring the t sites , the corresponding structures could be interpreted as geometries of the root system .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that in the hexagonal unit cell material contains atoms with different nature . in this way",
    ", the metal atom positions could be associated with fermionic roots , while the ordinary atoms are associated with the bosonic roots .",
    "this observation could be explored further to give a complete picture of the dictionary presented in table 3 .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a new method to approach to 2d material physics .",
    "in particular , we have presented a dictionary between rank two lie symmetries and the geometry of 2d material physics . in this way",
    ", the material unit cell has been interpreted as a root system .",
    "more precisely , we have analyzed in some details the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lie symmetries and found they are linked to hexagonal materials .",
    "this approach could be applied to lie supersymmetries corresponding to fermionic degrees of freedom providing a new way to investigate doping material geometries .",
    "we intend to investigated elsewhere other symmetries to complete the table 3 by introducing other lie symmetries used in modern physics .",
    "this work comes up with the opening of many windows .",
    "we would like to stress that a possible connection with string theory can be given .",
    "in fact , the correspondence presented here shears many similarities with the link between singularity theory and lie symmetries .",
    "this link based on a correspondence between the ade roots and the two - cycles used in in the deformation of ade singularities of ale spaces considered as local versions of the k3 surface . in fact , to each simple root one associates a complex projective space @xmath43 used in the blowing up of singular points .",
    "this connection has been considered as an important development in the string theory compactification supported by the string - string duality in six dimensions and d - brane configurations on which gauge theories live .",
    "this has been controlled by the root systems including the hexagonal one explored in particle physics@xcite .",
    "inspired from these connections , one can speculate on string theory interpretation in terms of @xmath2 string junctions associated with root systems of simply and non simply laved lie symmetries developed in @xcite . in this picture",
    ", we anticipate that the material physics can be studied using brane physics .",
    "it is recalled that a brane is an extended object upon which open strings can end with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0 material unit cell can be represented by open strings stretched on branes with similar behaviors . indeed , writing the two simple roots in terms of a real basis @xmath44 of the orthonormal vectors of @xmath45 @xmath46 it",
    "is possible to give an interpretation in terms of three branes associated with the basis @xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath48 brane charge webs should satisfy the vanishing charge condition @xmath49 required by the @xmath0 root system .",
    "the total six @xmath48 open strings can be obtained from the mirror branes with the opposed charges .",
    "a possible charge vector can given by solving the above equations .",
    "we expect that the corresponding physics content can be determined explicitly from the geometry of the @xmath50 networks .",
    "this formulation is quite similar to toric realization of the @xmath51 projective space @xcite .",
    "it is a complex two dimensional manifold having an @xmath52 toric action exhibiting three fixed points associated with an equation similar to ( [ charge ] ) .",
    "it would therefore be of interest to try to extract information on material physics based on such mathematical backgrounds .",
    "we believe that these questions deserve to be investigated further .",
