    "in this paper are presented a selection of searches of new physics beyond the standard model performed by the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations , with proton - proton collision data recorded in 2011 and 2012 at and .",
    "physics model covered by this paper are various , from extra - dimensions searches to black holes , dark matter , high mass resonances involving top quarks , generation quark and leptoquarks searches .",
    "supersymmetry and other exotic physics searches are discussed in other proceedings of the moriond ewk 2013 conference .",
    "the search for large compactified extra - dimensions ( eds ) , as proposed by the arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) model @xcite , is motivated by the solve of the hierarchy problem of the sm referring to the large difference between the electroweak scale ( @xmath1 tev ) and the gravity scale ( @xmath2 tev ) . in the add model",
    ", the gravity propagates into a 3 + 1+dimension space , where @xmath3 is the number of eds , while the standard model particles are confined into a 3 + 1 dimension space . in this framework the gravitational flux is diluted in this multidimensional space and the effective planck scale @xmath4 can be reduced to a scale similar to @xmath5 and gravitons can be produced at the lhc .",
    "several experimental signatures indicating the presence of eds have been studied by the atlas and cms collaboration .      since the graviton is able to propagate in the extra - dimensions , the first type of signature indicating the presence of eds is a large amount of missing transverse energy ( ) .",
    "the final state jet+has been performed by the atlas experiment with a sample of data at corresponding to 10 @xcite .",
    "the offline event selection requires a large amount of , one high - jet and no additional lepton or jet in the event .",
    "several filters are applied to reject beam - related backgrounds , cosmic rays and anomalous electronic - noise events .",
    "[ fig : extradim].a shows the spectrum for the selected events .",
    "the number of observed events in the data is in good agreement with the sm expectations and lower limits are set on the add model variable , as a function of : values of are excluded below 2.58 ( @xmath6 ) to 2.88 ( @xmath7 ) tev at 95% c.l .. + other studies have been performed by looking for an excess of data at high dilepton masses , indicating the presence of gravitons decaying into a lepton - antilepton pair .",
    "the cms collaboration studied both and decay channels with data corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 20 @xcite .",
    "events are selected by requiring the presence of two well - identified , opposite charge , same flavor , isolated leptons . since no excess at high masses",
    "have been noticed in both channels , limits are set on , related to by the formula @xmath8^{1/(\\delta+2 ) } \\md$ ] .",
    "[ fig : extradim].b illustrates a summary of the lower limits set on by several experiments for @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "a consequence of the presence of extra - dimensions is the production of microscopic black - holes in collisions at the lhc .",
    "the experimental signature of a microscopic black hole is a large transverse energy carried by physical objects ( charged leptons , jets , photons or invisible particles ) .",
    "such signatures have been studied by the cms collaboration with 3.7 of collisions data at @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 variable is used to separate black hole candidate events from sm backgrounds , dominated by qcd multijet production , for several physical object multiplicities . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bh].a , data are in agreement with the sm expectations and lower limits are set on black hole masses for several theoretical models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bh].b ) .",
    "an interesting feature of the graviton production searches is their sensitivity to the production of dark matter particles @xmath11 , also called wimps : instead of a graviton , a pair of wimps is produced in association with a jet or a photon . therefore the monojet / monophoton results presented in section [ sec : edgrav ] can be interpreted as limits on the effective theory cut - off mass scale @xmath12 and as limit on the wimp - nucleons scattering cross section @xcite .",
    "several @xmath13 interaction operators , spin - dependent or spin - independent have been considered .",
    "[ fig : dm ] shows the upper limit on wimp - nucleon inelastic cross section , for several experiments .",
    "one can notice that limits from collider experiments are the most stringent for low @xmath11 masses and are complementary to dedicated experiments .",
    "the study of dilepton signatures allow the experimentalists to probe also the presence of contact interaction .",
    "since no excess in data have been observed ( see section [ sec : edgrav ] ) , lower limits are set on the contact interaction energy scale @xmath14 by the atlas experiment @xcite with a data sample of 5 at .",
    "values of @xmath14 are excluded below 13.9 tev at 95% c.l . for constructive interferences while destructive interferences are excluded for @xmath15 tev at 95% c.l ..",
    "several searches for high masses resonances , produced by the decay of a high mass z boson or a kaluza - klein gluon , have been performed by the atlas and cms collaboration with collision data at corresponding to 5 in both semileptonic and full hadronic channels @xcite .",
    "no evidence of beyond standard model resonances have been seen so far with data .",
    "the most stringent limits have been set in the semileptonic channel ( table [ tab : ttbar ] ) .",
    ".more stringent limits on z and kk gluon masses from the search for resonances set by atlas and cms . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "various models of physics beyond the standard model have been probed in various final states , and no evidence of new physics have been seen so far , with data collected by the atlas and cms experiment at or .",
    "limits were set on key observables of the different models .",
    "further searches for new physics signatures are still ongoing with the full dataset recorded with , corresponding to an total integrated luminosity of 20 .",
