    "the experimental observation by the naval architect scott russel of solitary waves propagating in channels at different speeds , and interacting in a nonlinear way before recovering their initial shape , motivated the studies on the mathematical modelling of water wave motion at the end of the xix century .",
    "the first works can be retraced back to boussinesq , rayleigh , korteweg and de vries .",
    "the celebrated kdv equation allows for a first mathematical description of such phenomena .",
    "this equation can be derived as an asymptotic model from the free surface euler equations in the so called shallow water regime @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote respectively the average elevation of the liquid over the bottom and the characteristic wavelengt .",
    "it models small amplitude waves , _",
    "i.e. _ waves such that the dimensionless amplitude parameter @xmath9 satisfies @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the typical amplitude .",
    "such small amplitude waves feature both nonlinear and dispersive effects . for larger amplitude waves",
    "nonlinear effects become preponderant and wave breaking can eventually occur . as the kdv equation is no longer suitable for the description of breaking mechanisms  its solutions remain smooth for all time  a considerable effort was made toward the modelling of larger amplitude , possibly breaking waves , see , _ e.g. _ , the monograph  @xcite .",
    "such studies culminated with the derivation in 1993 , by camassa and holm ,  @xcite of an equation obtained from the vertically averaged water wave system , written in lie - poisson hamiltonian form , by an asymptotic expansion preserving the hamiltonian structure .",
    "the scaling of validity of the camassa ",
    "holm equation is @xmath12 and @xmath13 : such scaling includes that of kdv allowing higher order accuracy .",
    "alternative rigorous derivations of the camassa ",
    "holm equation are also available , see  @xcite .",
    "such equation attracted a considerable interest in the past 20 years , not only due its hydrodynamical relevance ( it was the first equation capturing both soliton - type solitary waves as well as breaking waves ) but also because of its extremely rich mathematical structure .",
    "in fact , the camassa  holm equation was written for the first time in a different context , as one of the 12 integrable equations classified by fokas and fuchsteiner  @xcite and obtained from a nonlinear operator satisfying suitable defining properties , applying a recursive operator that is an hereditary symmetry .",
    "the camassa ",
    "holm equation is usually written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 can be interpreted as an horizontal velocity of the water at a certain depth and @xmath16 is the dispersion parameter .",
    "the dispertionless case  @xmath17 is of mathematical interest as in this case the equation possess soliton solutions ( often named _ peakons _ ) peaked at their crest , of the form @xmath18 .",
    "multi - peakon interactions is studied in @xcite . for @xmath19",
    "the equation admits smooth solitons .    in the shallow water interpretation ,",
    "however , @xmath16 is proportional to the square root of the water depth and can not be zero .",
    "on the other hand , the same equation , with  @xmath17 appears , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the study of the dynamics of a class of non - newtonian , second - grade fluids ( see @xcite ) , or when modelling vibrations inside hyper - elastic rods . in the latter case peakons",
    "correspond to physical solutions .",
    "more in general , the propagation of nonlinear waves inside cylindrical hyper - elastic rods , assuming that the diameter is small when compared to the axial length scale , is described by the one dimensional equation ( see @xcite ) , @xmath20 here @xmath21 represents the radial stretch relative to a pre - stressed state , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are physical constants depending on the material .",
    "the scaling transformations @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , allow us to reduce the above equation to @xmath28 notice that when the physical parameter @xmath29 ( related to the finger deformation tensor ) is equal to  @xmath30 , one recovers the dispersionless camassa ",
    "holm equation .",
    "several positive or negative values of  @xmath29 correspond to known hyper - elastic materials .",
    "common important features of the camassa  holm and the rod equation include :    * the conservation of the energy integral @xmath31 for classical and sufficiently decaying solutions . * the local well - posedness theory : the cauchy problems for equation   and   are well - posed in the sobolev space @xmath32 for @xmath33 ( or in suitable besov spaces ) , locally in time .",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite . *",
    "wave breaking scenario : the maximal existence time @xmath34 such that the solution belongs to @xmath35 is finite if and only if @xmath36 is unbounded from below ( or from above when @xmath37 ) near the blowup time .",
    "up to the time @xmath34 , the solution remains uniformly bounded .",
    "see @xcite . * finite time blowup criteria on the initial data and upper bound estimates on @xmath34 .",
    "see @xcite . * exponentially decaying solitary wave solutions .",

    "see @xcite . *",
    "the existence of global conservative or dissipative weak solutions .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "beside such common features , the camassa ",
    "holm equation is considerably better understood than the rod equation . indeed , contrary to the rod equation with @xmath38 , equation   possess a bi - hamiltonian structure that makes the equation formally integrable via the inverse scattering method .",
    "elegant geometric interpretations ( see @xcite ) are available : for example , equation   gives rise to a geodesic flow of a right invariant metric on the bott - virasoro group .",
    "this equation also admits infinitely many conservation laws .",
    "moreover , it has solitary waves interacting like solitons that are orbitally stable , see  @xcite .",
    "the global existence of strong solutions of the camassa ",
    "holm equation can be obtained putting suitable sign conditions on the associated initial potential @xmath39 , see @xcite .",
    "when @xmath38 , as the sign of the potential is no longer conserved by the flow , such global existence criterion is no longer valid .",
    "in fact , we know of no general condition on the initial datum guaranteeing that the corresponding solution of the rod equation remains in  @xmath40 ( @xmath33 ) for all time .",
    "the value of the parameter  @xmath29 plays a crucial role : two limit situations occur when  @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in the latter case _",
    "any _ non - zero solution eventually develops a singularity ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when  @xmath41 , no blowup can occur .",
    "( when @xmath41 , the rod equation boils down to the bbm equation , a model for the unidirectional evolution of long waves , @xcite )",
    ". physically , the formation of a singularity corresponds to a formation of a crack inside the rod .",
    "both behaviors in the two limit cases @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not physically realistic for real rods , but it is interesting to observe that there are known materials such that  @xmath29 is indeed close to  @xmath43 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath44 ) and others such that  @xmath29 is close to zero ( _ e.g. _ @xmath45 ) .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a list of physically acceptable values of  @xmath29 ( ranging from  @xmath46 to @xmath47 ) .",
    "in this paper we will consider the cauchy problem for a nonlinear dispersive wave equation including both   and as a particular case : @xmath48_x-[f(u)]_{xxx}+\\bigl[g(u)+\\frac{f''(u)}{2}u_x^2\\bigr]_x=0.\\ ] ] equation   is often referred as the _ generalized hyper - elastic rod wave equation _",
