    "to first approximation , electronic and vibrational properties can be treated separately in condensed matter due to the large mass ratio between electrons and ions , e.g. , within the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "however , corrections to this approximation , which depend on the strength of the electron - phonon interaction , are of considerable importance both theoretically and experimentally . here",
    "we investigate the effects of electron - phonon interactions on the quasiparticle properties of electrons .",
    "due to such interactions , the electron energy levels @xmath0 are not sharply defined , but have finite lifetimes characterized by the electron self - energy @xmath1 , which lead to broadening of the associated spectral function .",
    "such effects are visible experimentally , e.g. , in high resolution arpes spectra at low temperatures.@xcite    in general , the electron spectral function is dominated by a sharp quasiparticle peak , but it can also exhibit satellites due to phonon excitations .",
    "according to migdal s theorem,@xcite only the leading order electron - phonon interaction contributions to the self - energy are important , due to the large mass ratio between electrons and nuclei . in that case",
    ", the electron self - energy can be approximated by the simplest diagram , and vertex corrections can be neglected .",
    "this approximation has been investigated in detail @xcite and extended to finite temperature , e.g. , by allen .",
    "@xcite the migdal approximation is analogous to the @xmath2 approximation of hedin @xcite for electrons coupled to plasmons where @xmath3 is the electron green s function and @xmath4 the screened coulomb interaction .",
    "since a similar formalism applies to phonons , electron - hole pairs and other neutral bosonic excitations , we will refer to this leading order diagram as the gw approximation .",
    "the gw theory leads to spectral functions with a quasiparticle peak and two satellite features originating from single - boson excitations , one on each side of the main quasiparticle peak .",
    "in contrast to the gw approximation , however , systems of electrons coupled to neutral bosonic excitations generally exhibit multiple satellites , as observed in photoemission experiments .",
    "@xcite moreover , the gw approximation is known to be unsatisfactory for describing satellite structures , as the satellite peaks typically appear at the wrong energies and with the wrong intensities compared to experiment .",
    "thus , it is of interest to investigate possible corrections to migdal s theorem , i.e. , the effects of higher order terms in an expansion in powers of the electron - phonon coupling.@xcite one approach to this end is to investigate contributions to the self - energy from the vertex function @xmath5 , as in the formal identity @xmath6 .",
    "however , direct calculations of @xmath5 have been formidably challenging , and there has been little progress along these lines . an attractive alternative that overcomes some of the shortcomings of gw",
    "is provided by the cumulant expansion , @xcite which is an exponential representation of the electron green s function in the time domain .",
    "the cumulant expansion is exact for the case of a deep core - level coupled to bosons , and generalizations have been developed for valence electrons coupled to plasmons .",
    "@xcite the approach has been applied with considerable success in many cases , ranging from multiple plasmon satellites in photoemission@xcite to dynamical mean field theory.@xcite nevertheless , the conventional approach based on the time - ordered green s function is only strictly applicable for the hole- _ or _ particle - branch of the spectral function depending on whether the state is above or below the fermi level .",
    "this limitation is particularly problematic in systems with particle - hole symmetry , such as electrons coupled to phonons . to overcome this difficulty , we utilize here the recently developed retarded cumulant ( rc ) approach , which is based on a particle / hole cumulant and a _ retarded _ green s function formalism.@xcite a further goal of the present work is to develop a practical approach for calculations of phonon contributions to properties of condensed matter .",

    "the generalization to insulators or molecular systems with discrete spectra near @xmath19 is straightforward , but will not be treated here .",
    "schematically , the gw approximation for the self - energy is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath3 is the one - electron green s function and @xmath4 is an approximation for the screened coulomb interaction . within gw ,",
    "the usual strategy is to calculate the spectral function @xmath23 from the imaginary part of the one - electron green s function in frequency space,@xcite @xmath24 the spectral function is comprised of two main features  a dominant quasiparticle peak at @xmath25 with width @xmath26 and phonon satellites at @xmath27 , consistent with ref .",
    "other physical properties such as the quasiparticle lifetime and energy levels can be obtained from the properties of @xmath23 and @xmath28 .",
