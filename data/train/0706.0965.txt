    "transient events in the solar atmosphere can often be explained only with models of fast reconnection . while the petschek ( 1964 ) model of reconnection has long been invoked to account for fast reconnection , simulations as well as experiments ( e.g. , biskamp 1986 ; kulsrud 2001 ; ji et al .",
    "1998 ) seem to indicate that the reconnection geometry might be of the sweet - parker kind ( sweet 1958 ; parker 1963 ) .",
    "anomalous resistivity has been often invoked to explain fast reconnection ( e.g. , biskamp and welter 1980 ; yokoyama and shibata 1994 ) .",
    "nakariakov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have invoked an anomalous resistivity that is as much as 6 orders of magnitude larger than the classical value in order to explain the damping of coronal waves ( see , however , klimchuk , tanner & demoortel 2004 for an alternative explanation ) . based on observations of a variety of dynamic events , dere ( 1996 )",
    "concluded that the solar atmosphere is much more resistive than what can be accounted for by classical resistivity .",
    "tsiklauri ( 2005 ) has invoked a novel mechanism to account for heating of coronal loops .",
    "however , it requires the loops to be comprised of extremely small sub - threads , with dimensions as small as a few proton larmor radii .",
    "if the resistivity is larger than the classical value , it might alleviate this severe requirement on the thickness of the individual strands comprising coronal loops .",
    "several candidate mechanisms have been proposed for the microscopic origin of anomalous resistivity , such as that due to ion - acoustic turbulence ( bychenkov , silin & uryupin 1988 ; uzdensky 2003 ) , due to the kinetic alfvn wave ( kaw ) instability ( voitekno 1995 ; bellan 1999 ; bellan 2001 ) , and that arising from chaotic particle motion near the null region ( numata & yoshida 2002 ; 2003 ) . in this paper ,",
    "one mechanism we will examine in detail is that due to numata & yoshida ( 2002 ; 2003 ) , where the chaotic motion of particles in the relatively unmagnetized null region mimics collisions and can therefore be used as a basis for deriving an effective anomalous resistivity .",
    "the other one we will consider is the current - driven kaw instability .",
    "one of the important bases used for invoking current - driven instabilities such as the ion - acoustic instability or the kaw instability is the presence of magnetic field - aligned currents . in turn",
    ", the presence of field - aligned currents is inferred from the fact that solar flares are usually produced from active regions with significant shear , and that there is often a significant change in shear following the occurrence of a flare ( e.g. , sivaraman , rausaria & aleem 1992 ) .",
    "the premise is that since the reconnecting fields are highly sheared , the classical reconnection geometry with antiparallel fields annhilating is no longer applicable , and there could well be significant magnetic field components along the reconnection - induced currents .",
    "however , such observational inferences arising from two - dimensional pictures of filaments should be treated with caution .",
    "firstly , as venkatakrishnan ( 1993 ) demonstrates , redeployment of magnetic flux sources relative to the main sunspot(s ) and/or emergence of new flux is a more satisfactory explanation for the observations of sivaraman , rausaria & aleem ( 1992 ) .",
    "furthermore , extensive vector magnetogram observations of flare producing active regions have revealed that apparent photospheric magnetic shear is not really an essential condition for flare production ( wang 1997 ) .",
    "their in - depth study shows that the photospheric magnetic shear does not change after several m - class flares , and it even _ increases _ after the occurrence of large , x - class flares ( in fact , it does so for all the x - class flares in their sample ) .",
    "these paradoxes can be understood only in the context of a three - dimensional reconnection process , of which photospheric shear provides only a partial , two - dimensional picture .",
    "the crucial difference between a scenario where the resistivity arising out of the current - driven kaw instability would be dominant and one where the chaos - induced resistivity would be so is that the former mechanism can proceed even when the reconnecting magnetic fields are not strictly antiparallel , and magnetic field - aligned currents can therefore be present . as discussed above , the three - dimensional geometry of reconnecting fields",
    "is not immediately obvious from current observations .",
    "however , although the direct connection to observations of sheared filaments might be simplistic , it is possible that field - aligned currents will exist in reconnection regions .",
    "it therefore stands to reason that we should consider a general scenario where the reconnecting magnetic fields need not be exactly antiparallel , where the anomalous resistivity arises out of a current - induced instability . of the two current induced instabilities we have mentioned , bellan ( 2001 ) has shown that the kaw instability has a lower threshold than the ion - acoustic one .",
    "in addition to the chaos - induced resistivity model of numata & yoshida ( 2002 ; 2003 ) , we will therefore also examine the viability of the kaw instability - induced anomalous resistivity using the approach taken by voitenko ( 1995 ) .",
    "the lundquist number gives the ratio of the lorentz ( @xmath0 ) force to the force due to resistive magnetic diffusion .",
    "we take this to be the figure of merit for evaluating the efficacy of the anomalous resistivity mechanisms we consider .",
    "we will derive lundquist numbers for solar flare events reported in isobe et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and nagashima & yokoyama ( 2006 ) .",
    "we will compare these observationally mandated lundquist numbers with those derived using the anomalous resistivity mechanisms of numata & yoshida ( 2002 ; 2003 ) and voitenko ( 1995 ) .",
    "the macroscopic lundquist number is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the alfvn velocity , @xmath3 is a suitable macroscopic scale length and @xmath4 is the magnetic diffusivity . in mks units ,",
    "the magnetic diffusivity is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the resistivity and @xmath7 is the magnetic permeability of free space . using eq  ( [ eq2 ] ) in eq  ( [ eq1 ] ) gives @xmath8    for a given transient event in the solar atmosphere , the _ observed _ diffusivity is @xmath9 where @xmath3 is the observed lengthscale and @xmath10 is the observed timescale .",
    "this gives the _ required _ lundquist number as mandated by the observations , @xmath11      we now turn our attention to the lundquist number that can be realised by using the chaos - induced resistivity @xmath12 defined in numata & yoshida ( 2002 ) . using their anomalous resistivity prescription @xmath13 in eq  ( [ eq3 ] ) we get @xmath14 where we have used the following expression for the ion skin depth @xmath15 : @xmath16 using the expression @xmath17 for the ion cyclotron frequency , we can rewrite eq  ( [ eq4 ] ) as @xmath18 the quantity @xmath19 is the effective collision frequency in units of the ion cyclotron frequency .",
    "numata & yoshida ( 2002 ) show that , in effect , @xmath19 is equal to the alfvn mach number @xmath20 of the flow outside the reconnection region .",
    "this yields @xmath21    the expression for the lundquist number @xmath22 given by eq  ( [ eq6a ] ) arises out of using the chaos - induced resistivity @xmath12 and assuming that the resistivity is operative over a _ macroscopic _",
    "lengthscale @xmath3 .",
    "however , malyshkin , linde & kulsrud ( 2005 ) and malyshkin & kulsrud ( 2006 ) suggest that it is not enough for the resistivity to be enhanced for the reconnection to occur at a fast rate ; the resistivity also needs to be _ localized _ over small lengthscales . if the resistivity is spatially localized over a lengthscale @xmath23 , the resulting lundquist number is obtained by simply using @xmath24 in eq  ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "numata & yoshida s ( 2002 ) treatment suggests that the enhanced resistivity might be localized over lengthscales comparable to the ion skin depth @xmath15 .",
    "using @xmath25 in ( eq  [ eq4 ] ) yields the following expression for the lundquist number resulting from chaos - induced resistivity localized over an ion skin depth : @xmath26 as mentioned earlier , @xmath19 can be taken to equal to the alfvn mach number @xmath20 ( numata & yoshida 2002 ) , which yields @xmath27 in writing equation  ( [ eq8 ] ) it may be noted that we have used the macroscopic alfvn mach number @xmath20 , whereas numata & yoshida ( 2002 ) have referred to the microscopic alfvn mach number . on the other hand , lin et al . ( 2007 ) , have related a microscopic definition of the lundquist number ( the ratio of the resistive diffusion and alfvn timescales , which is equal to the ratio of the width to thickness of the current sheet ) , to the macroscopic alfvn mach number .",
    "the use of the macroscopic alfvn number is primarily because it is the only one that can be observationally estimated .",
    "we follow the approach of voitenko ( 1995 ) in evaluating the lundquist number @xmath28 arising out of the kaw instability . for conditions applicable to the solar corona ( in particular",
    ", we note that the alfvn speed they use is similar to the values in table 1 ) , voitenko ( 1995 ) quotes the following approximate value for the magnetic diffusion coefficient @xmath29 arising from this mechanism : @xmath30 following equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) , and since the kaw anomalous resistivity is naturally localized over a thickness of the order of an ion skin depth ( voitenko 1995 ) , we write the lundquist number @xmath28 as @xmath31 where we have used @xmath32 .",
    "equations ( [ eq9 ] ) , ( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eq5 ] ) , ( [ eq3b ] ) and @xmath33 yields @xmath34",
    "we use the formalism developed in the previous section to derive the ratios @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 for several reconnection events , using observational data given in nagashima & yokoyama ( 2006 ) .",
    "they have compiled a statistical study of flares observed with the soft x - ray telescope aboard the yohkoh spacecraft .",
    "we have listed the observed lengthscale @xmath3 and timescale @xmath10 , inferred magnetic field @xmath38 , and reconnection inflow speed @xmath39 for each of these events in table 1 .",
    "the inferred ambient density for each of the events is @xmath40 . using these quantities",
    ", we have derived the alfvn speed @xmath2 and the alfvn mach number @xmath41 .",
    "we have compared @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 for each of these events using equations  ( [ eq3b ] ) , ( [ eq6a ] ) , ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "@xmath42 is the lundquist number mandated by the observations , while @xmath22 is the lundquist number obtained by assuming that the resistivity is due to the numata - yoshida mechanism ( numata & yoshida 2002 ; 2003 ) .",
    "@xmath43 is the lundquist number obtained by assuming that the resistivity is due to the numata - yoshida mechanism , and that it is localized over a lengthscale equal to the ion skin depth @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath28 is the lundquist number arising from the kaw instability , and is naturally localized over an ion skin depth .",
    "for all the events , it is evident from table 1 that @xmath43 is much closer to @xmath42 than @xmath22 is . unlike nagashima & yokoyama ( 2006 ) ,",
    "dere ( 1996 ) does not explicitly list an inflow velocity @xmath39 for the events he has considered . using @xmath44 , the alfvn mach number is @xmath45 . for each of the events listed in dere ( 1996 ) , this yields values of @xmath35 which are similar to those for the events listed in table 1 .",
    "however , when this definition of @xmath20 is used in the definition of @xmath43 ( equation  [ eq8 ] ) , it works out to be exactly the same as @xmath42 ( equation  [ eq3b ] ) .",
    "the numbers in table 1 show that the lundquist number arising from the numata - yoshida resistivity localized over an ion skin depth ( @xmath43 ) as well as that from the kaw instability ( @xmath28 ) are fairly close to the lundquist number @xmath42 mandated by observations .",
    "it is also evident that the resistivity needs not only to be enhanced , but also well localized in order to explain the observations .",
