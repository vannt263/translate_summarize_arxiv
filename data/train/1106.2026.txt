    "three component antiferromagnets in three spatial dimensions in an external magnetic field in @xmath0 direction contain in their phase diagram two second order transition lines : ( i ) between the paramagnetic and the spin flop phase and ( ii ) between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phase .",
    "the point where these two lines meet is a multicritical point which turned out to be either bicritical or tetracritical . within the renormalization group ( rg )",
    "theory the stability and attraction region of the static fixed point ( fp ) of the rg transformation determines , which kind of multicritical behavior is realized . for the bicritical point",
    "it is the heisenberg fp , for the tetracritical point it is the biconical one .",
    "the stabilty of a fp depends on the system s global features as the space and order parameter ( op ) dimensions @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in @xmath3 , the case considered here ,",
    "the biconical fp is stable apart from a restricted attraction region of the heisenberg fp .",
    "the static phase transition on each of the phase transition lines belongs for ( i ) to an isotropic heisenberg model with @xmath4 and for ( ii ) to heisenberg model with @xmath5 @xcite .    concerning the dynamical universality classes the transition ( i ) belongs to the class described by model f and ( ii ) belongs to the model c class ( for the notation see @xcite ) .",
    "at the multicritical point the critical behavior is described by a new universality class both in statics and dynamics .",
    "the interesting feature of these systems is that all the different ops characterizing the ordered phase are physically accessible .",
    "this is most important for the dynamical behavior since the only other example belonging to model f is the superfluid transition in @xmath6he where the op ( the complex macroscopic wave function of the condensate @xcite ) is experimentally not accessible @xcite . here",
    "the ops are the components of the staggered magnetization .",
    "their correlations ( static and dynamical ) can be measured by neutron scattering .",
    "a complete description of the critical dynamics near the multicritical point mentioned above has to take into account the slow dynamical densities which are the ops and the conserved densities present in the system . due to the external magnetic field",
    "the only conserved density which has to be taken into account is the magnetization in direction of the external field .",
    "a derivation of the dynamical equations follows along the usual steps calculating the reversible terms from the non - zero poisson brackets , introducing irreversible terms present also in the hydrodynamic limit , dropping irrelevant terms and taking into account terms arising in the renormalization procedure ( see e.g. the review @xcite ) .",
    "such a dynamical model has already been considered in @xcite by rg theory and it was argued that due to nonanalytic terms in @xmath7 a fp in two loop order qualitative different from the one loop fp is found .",
    "the result of the one loop calculations is that the time scales of the parallel and perpendicular components of the staggered magnetization scale differently whereas calculated in two loop order they scale similar although the fp value of the timescale ratio of the two components can not be found by @xmath8 expansion and might be very small in @xmath3 namely of @xmath9 .",
    "it was argued that the terms leading to the singular behavior in @xmath8 do not contribute to the fp value of the mode coupling .",
    "the calculations of the rg - functions in @xcite where not complete in two loop order ( they took into account only the terms which lead to the nonanalytic behavior in @xmath8 ) . at that time also",
    "the heisenberg fp ( named @xmath10 ) was considered to be the stable static one , whereas it turned out in two loop order ( resummed ) that it is the biconical fp ( named @xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    ".dynamical fp values ( zeros of the corresponding dynamical @xmath12-functions ) at @xmath3 of different models for the time scale ratios @xmath13 and the mode coupling constant @xmath14 .",

    "they are compared with the two loop results found in the model c multicritical point @xcite as well as in the critical points of model c for the one component op @xcite and of model f for the two component order parameter @xcite .",

    "weak scaling , as discussed in section [ generalbehavior ] , is fulfilled .",
    "the difference to the one loop result is now that the dynamic exponents @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the ops are equal in the asymptotic region , while @xmath35 stays different .",
    "moreover the transient exponents in two loop order are very small compared to one loop .",
    "there the effective exponents reach their asymptotic values about @xmath36 as can be seen from fig.[z1loop ] . in two loop order",
    "the asymptotic region is of magnitudes smaller . from fig.[zetasub ] one can see that at the heisenberg fp the flow parameter has to be of the order @xmath37 to obtain the asymptotic values of the dynamic exponents . at the biconical fp @xmath38",
    "has to be even of the order @xmath39 ( note that there is a factor @xmath40 between the @xmath41-scales in fig.[zetasub ] ) to reach asymptotic values .",
    "however as will be seen in the next section the subspace will not be reached by the flow in the complete parameter space for reasonable values of @xmath38 .",
    "although in general the dynamic flow equations have to be solved in the full parameter space , the results for the effective exponents presented in the previous subsection are obtained from the flow equations which already have been reduced to the subspace @xmath42 .",
    "the reason to do this is that the flow and the @xmath19-functions in the full parameter space shows some peculiar behavior .    in the non - asymptotic region",
    "the flow is generated by the system of equations for four parameters which are @xmath43 , @xmath16 , @xmath44 and @xmath17 obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ dw1dl ] ) - ( [ df1dl ] ) and ( [ sq ] ) .",

    "[ tab3 ] . due to the presence of the static asymmetric couplings @xmath45 and the mode coupling @xmath17 an imaginary part of @xmath46 is produced even if one starts with a zero initial value .",
    "starting with a typical set of initial values , i.e. @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 at the flow parameter value @xmath51 , the effective exponents in the complete parameter space have been calculated in @xmath3 .",
    "the result is presented in fig.[vgl ] for both static fixed points , where the solid lines are the results of the two loop calculation and the dashed line is a result of a complete ( flow and effective exponent ) one loop calculation .",
    "however the static fp values from tab .",
    "[ tab3 ] have been used also in the dynamic one loop flow .",
    "there it seems that in two loop order the same results as in the one loop calculation are obtained .",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 are getting close together ( solid lines ) for flow parameters @xmath54 and seem to coincide even numerically with the corresponding results in one loop order ( dashed line ) .",
    "this is the type of weak scaling in one loop order , which also can be seen from fig.[z1loop ] and in qualitative contradiction to the discussion in the previous sections ( see fig.[zetasub ] ) .",
    "but the examination of the flow of the dynamic parameters reveals a fundamental difference between the one and two loop calculation .",
    "in one loop order the dynamic parameters @xmath43 , @xmath16 , @xmath44 and @xmath17 merge to the fp values when the effective exponents turns over in their constant asymptotic values , which is presented in fig.[flow1loop ]",
    ". this happens in the region about @xmath55 and the dynamic parameters stay constant for all lower flow parameter values . in two loop order",
    "the situation is different .",
    "although the two loop results for the effective exponents look like one has reached the asymptotic region ( the exponents seem to be constant ) , the dynamic parameters in contrast are far from their asymptotic fp values .",
    "this is presented in fig.[naflow ] .",
    "the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath16 are still increasing and obviously have not reached a fp value . at the first glance the flow of @xmath17 seems to have reached a fp value ( see lowest plot in fig.[naflow ] ) . but",
    "a closer examination shows that this is not the case .",
    "@xmath17 is constantly increasing with a very small slope as can be seen from the inserted small figure , where both axes has been enlarged .",
    "actually the set of two loop @xmath12-functions does not have a zero for finite @xmath46 and @xmath44 , and therefore no fp exists in the parameter region of fig.[naflow ] .",
    "thus the effective exponents in two loop order in fig.[vgl ] only show a pseudo - asymptotic behavior completely different from real asymptotic behavior ( there @xmath52 and @xmath56 have to be equal ) discussed in section [ assub ] ( see fig .",
    "[ zetasub ] ) . even if one draws the @xmath41-axis in fig.[vgl ] down to @xmath57 , as done for the flow in fig.[naflow ] , the picture remains to be the same , that is the effective exponents seem to be constant , with the exception that the background behavior is not longer visible because the region is too small .",
    "also if one changes initial conditions of the parameters the qualitative result remains the same .",
    "the different flows merge within a region of @xmath58 to the same result .    in order to get some insight how",
    "this pseudo - asymptotic behavior is possible , in fig.[flow ] the relative slopes @xmath59 for the parameters @xmath60 chosen to be @xmath43 and @xmath17 have been calculated .",
    "one can see that the relative changes in these parameters drop down to very small values . as a first consequence one has to calculate down to extremely small flow parameter values @xmath61 where one can expect to leave the pseudo - asymptotic region .",
    "but although the @xmath12-functions can not be zero in the considered parameter range they may reach values which are so small that they can not longer be separated numerically from zero .",
    "this means that coming from the background it is impossible to pass the pseudo - asymptotic region numerically into the real asymptotic region .",
    "this is the reason why in the previous section the flow has been started in an asymptotic subspace .",
    "due to the presence of logarithmic terms in the timescale ratio @xmath62 the fp value of @xmath62 has to be finite . as follows from tab .",
    "[ tablei ] via eq .",
    "( [ vperpv ] ) it turns out to be very small leading to very large ( negative ) values of @xmath63 .",
    "so one expects that the @xmath63-terms begin to dominate @xmath64 in a certain region of @xmath65 near the asymptotics .",
    "making the @xmath63-terms explicit one may rewrite @xmath64 , given in eq .",
    "( [ zetagammape ] ) , as @xmath66 inserting eq .",
    "( [ vperpv ] ) , the essential term is the real part @xmath67 of the prefactor of @xmath68 .",

    "although the @xmath68 term already reaches very large negative values ( @xmath15 is very small ) , as expected , this is compensated by the prefactor @xmath67 which has very small values in the considered region . in the upper part of fig.[qterms ] the decadic logarithm of @xmath67 and @xmath73 have been plotted .",
    "both curves show a similar behavior and a small difference . in the lower part @xmath74",
    "is calculated from ( [ vprime ] ) - ( [ vprimeb ] ) . as a consequence of the results in the upper part of the figure the numerical values are about @xmath75 and one",
    "can see that the term is far away from being the leading one .",
    "there are other contributions to @xmath64 which have the same magnitude .",
    "thus the @xmath19-function is not in the asymptotic region as has been also indicated by the flow in fig.[naflow ] .",
    "thus one expects in the experimentally accessible region non - universal effective dynamical critical behavior .",
    "this is described in the crossover region to the background by the flow equations together with a suitable matching condition related to the temperature distance , the wave vector modulus etc .",
    "the initial conditions have to be found by comparison with experiment .",
    "our two loop calculation for the dynamics at the multicritical point in anisotropic antiferromagnets in an external magnetic field leads to a fp where the ops characterizing the parallel and perpendicular ordering with respect to the external field scale in the same way ( strong dynamic scaling ) .",
    "this holds independent wether the heisenberg fp or the biconical fp in statics is the stable one .",
    "the non - asymptotic analysis of the dynamic flow equations show that due to cancelation effects the critical behavior is described - in distances from the critical point accessible to experiments - by the critical behavior qualitatively found in one loop order .",
    "that means the time scales of the two op components become almost constant in a so called pseudo - asymptotic region and scale differently .",
    "so far we have not included the non - asymptotic flow of the static parameters which are expected to lead to minor deviations from the overall picture .",
    "another item would be the study of the decoupled fp since in the non - asymptotic region the ops remain statically and dynamically coupled and the behavior depend on the stability exponents how fast these effects decay .",
    "this in turn depends on the distance of the system in dimensional space and the space of the op components from the stability border line to other fps than the decoupled fp ( see fig . 1 in paper i ) .    the numerical results presented in this series of papers have been calculated for dimension @xmath3 .",
    "one might speculate that the peculiar behavior found is specific to the dimension of the physical space rather than to the multicritical character of the specific point .",
    "this aspect was out of the scope of this series of papers .",
    "we note that the two critical lines meet at the multicritical point ( bicritical or tetracritical ) tangential .",
    "this has been taken into account for the nonsaymptotic behavior by choosing a path approaching the multicritical point without meeting one of the two critical lines @xcite .",
    "the nonasymptotic behavior in fact is more complicated since two critical length scales are present in the system .",
    "this has to be taken into account when studying the crossover behavior in approaching one of the critical lines @xcite .",
    "only recently a bicritical point has been identified by computer simulation @xcite .",
    "the corresponding fp has been identified as the heisenberg fp which corresponds to the type of phase diagram obtained .",
    "it seems to be difficult to look for situations where a phase diagram containing a tetracritical point is present .",
    "even more complicated would it be to identify the dynamical characteristic of this multicritical point , where - coming from the disordered phase - two lines belonging to different dynamic universality classes meet .",
    "the dynamical universality class of the case with a @xmath76 op ( model c ) has been studied in @xcite with different results leading to critical exponents larger than expected .",
    "the dynamical universality class of the case with a @xmath77 op ( model f ) case has been studied by computer simulations in @xcite .",

    "<S> the non - asymptotic analysis of the dynamic flow equations shows that due to cancelation effects the critical behavior is described - in distances from the critical point accessible to experiments - by the critical behavior qualitatively found in one loop order . </S>",
    "<S> although one may conclude from the effective dynamic exponents ( taking almost their one loop values ) that weak scaling for the order parameter components is valid , the flow of the time scale ratios is quite different and they do not reach their asymptotic values . </S>"
