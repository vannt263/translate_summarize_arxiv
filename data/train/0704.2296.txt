    "a remarkable aspect of strong coupling field theory is the possibility that masses can be largely , or even entirely , created by interactions .",

    "indeed , the mass gap generated far exceeds the scale of the current quark masses present in the lagrangian .",
    "the strong coupling induces long range @xmath1 correlations that polarise the vacuum .",
    "it is the scale of these condensates that determines the mass generated , and this gap persists even in the chiral limit .",
    "as long known this underpins much of qcd phenomenology . in this paper",
    "we investigate this mass generation using the schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "the aim is to extract the behaviour of the @xmath2 condensate beyond the limit of zero quark mass .",
    "the interest in the value of such a condensate arises in the context of qcd sum - rules .",
    "there the operator product expansion ( ope ) is used to approximate the short distance behaviour of qcd . in studying currents like that of @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 ,",

    "the value of the @xmath2 condensate for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks is well determined to be @xmath11 by experiment  in particular from the low energy behaviour of @xmath12 scattering  @xcite .",
    "however , in the ope it is the value of the condensates away from the chiral limit that actually enters .",
    "since the current masses of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks are only a few mev , the resulting condensate is expected to be close to its value in the chiral limit , but how close ? for the first 20 years of qcd sum - rules their accuracy was never sufficient for it to matter whether this difference was a few percent , 10% or even 20% effect .",
    "this equally applied to the estimate by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov  @xcite that the @xmath13 condensate was @xmath14 of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 values .",

    "since the continuum schwinger - dyson equations can be solved for any value of the quark mass , they also provide a natural way to bridge the gap between lattice data at larger masses and the chiral limit of phenomenological importance .",
