    "one of the most promising applications of quantum science lies in the field of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "quantum optics provides an extremely convenient test bed for quantum information ideas because quantum effects dominate even at room temperatures and non - classical states are relatively easy to achieve in the laboratory .",
    "this has been most impressively illustrated with recent small - scale experimental demonstrations of quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "photon - number resolving detectors , as well as the ability to characterise quantum optical states using such detectors , are a key element in the further development of quantum optical information processing systems @xcite . due to the low energies carried by photons , contemporary detectors are incapable of resolving photon number with high fidelity .",
    "typically linear pin photodiodes used as direct detectors of the optical field are limited to mesoscopic photon - number regimes @xcite .",
    "recent results show promise at telecommunications wavelengths using liquid - he cooled diodes @xcite , bolometric devices @xcite and super - conducting nano - structures @xcite although such solutions are not yet widespread due to their inherent cost and/or cryogenic cooling complexities .",
    "consequently , use is commonly made of single photon detector modules ( spdms ) , based on avalanche photo - diodes ( apds ) .",
    "a number of techniques have been developed for approximating number - resolving detection using these inherently non - number - resolving detectors @xcite , all of which are variations on the idea that the optical field is distributed across multiple modes which are measured independently",
    ". the experiment is arranged so that the probability of any given mode being populated by more than one photon approaches zero .",
    "thus in the absence of dark counts , afterpulsing or imperfect quantum efficiency , the sum of the detection events across the modes closely approximates the number of photons in the incident state .    in the case of the ideal @xmath0-port multiplexer with ideal binary photon detectors ,",
    "the maximum number of photons able to be resolved is equal to the number of output modes .",
    "this limit arises due to excess input photons resulting in @xmath1 photons in the output modes , which are not distinguishable from the single photon case . in a realistic detector",
    ", however , the presence of loss means that @xmath2 input photons may result in @xmath3 clicks where @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath6 then it can be seen that the loss gives rise to a useable increase in the detector s dynamic range . in general",
    "though , the accuracy of the reconstruction degrades and the statistical errors increase with increasing amounts of loss .",
    "similarly , fragile non - classical effects are washed out by increased losses , as quantified in @xcite .",
    "this situation is further complicated by the presence of dark counts and afterpulsing .",
    "there have been many demonstrated solutions to the reconstruction of the photostatistics ( photon number distribution ) of an input field using binary ( on / off ) detectors , but they may each be loosely grouped into one of three categories . all realistic photodetectors exhibit loss , which is modelled by preceding an otherwise ideal detector with a beamsplitter of transmission @xmath7 .",
    "the photostatistics of the input state are thus convolved with the bernoulli ( binomial ) distribution arising from the stochastic photon selection process performed at the beamsplitter @xcite .",
    "this relationship forms the basis of the first category of reconstruction techniques - those involving inversion of the bernoulli distribution .",
    "the analytic inversion is cumbersome and requires @xmath8 @xcite , an impossible constraint on n - ports with @xmath9 which is further exaggerated at telecommunications wavelengths due to the very small quantum efficiencies .",
    "numerical approaches such as maximum likelihood techniques permit more realistic values of @xmath10 and have been successfully applied in @xcite .",
    "the second category involves reconstruction of the input density matrix , @xmath11 , via conditional probabilities and appears the most common contemporary approach .",
    "an n - port detector may be completely described by the corresponding conditional probability matrix @xmath12 which quantifies the probability of observing @xmath3 clicks , given @xmath2 incident photons .",
    "the experiments of @xcite perform a large number of measurements of an unknown input state , and record the number of clicks obtained from each measurement . by applying either the inverted matrix of @xmath12 values to the observed `` number of click '' statistics or utilising maximum likelihood techniques , the input photon number distribution may be obtained .    finally , as observed by @xcite ,",
    "an improvement in the accuracy of the reconstruction is possible by noting the coincidences of the @xmath3 detection events of the @xmath0 detectors .",
    "this is equivalent to recording detection signatures for each measurement and forms the basis of our reconstruction implementation . to date , experimental work in this third category has considered only @xmath13 distinct output modes @xcite for a number of detection efficiencies @xmath10 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present experimental results for @xmath14 time - domain modes with a fixed ( small ) value of @xmath10 for each mode .",
    "irrespective of the reconstruction category , the three approaches share the same goal common to all tomography problems - the calculation of the input state from a large data set of marginal distributions .",
    "although the analytic relationship between the measured marginal probability distributions is usually a known function of the input state , this is not the case for the inverse in general .",
    "even if an inverse analytic solution exists it is generally of no use as experimental and measurement uncertainties create an _ overcomplete _ data set for which there is no unique solution for @xmath11 .",
    "the problem may thus be restated as the determination of the best _ estimate _ @xmath15 for @xmath11 given the measured data set .",
    "the estimation of @xmath15 is significantly simplified by _ a priori _ assumptions of aspects of the statistics of the input state .",
    "if it may be assumed that the input state consists of negligible contributions from higher order fock states , i.e. @xmath16 , then the reconstructed hilbert space may be restricted to dimension @xmath17 .",
    "additional constraints such as the expected distribution ( e.g. poissonian ) and physicality via @xmath18 = 1 $ ] and @xmath19 further aid the reconstruction process .",
    "detection with on / off photodetectors will result in a particular pattern of detector clicks , which we call a _ signature_. the probability , @xmath20 , of the detection signature occurring whereby each of the detectors in vector @xmath21 trigger , and all others do not is given by @xcite @xmath22 \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\prod_{l\\notin \\vec{d } } \\left[(1 - p_\\mathrm{dc } ) p_\\mathrm{loss}(l)^{n_l } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 represents the probability of an input photon being coupled out of the @xmath24 port .",
    "similarly , @xmath25 indicates the probability of photon loss associated with port @xmath26 .",
    "both of these parameters are a function of the detector architecture and are detailed in @xcite . the dark count probability @xmath27 depends upon the particular on / off detector employed .",
    "the net probability of detecting @xmath3 photons , given by summing over all combinations of detection signatures where @xmath28 , for @xmath29 is total number of clicks , is thus @xmath30    it is worth noting that @xmath20 is not necessarily the same for all @xmath21 where @xmath28 .",
    "that is , different signatures corresponding to the same measured number of photons need nt have equal probabilities of occurring .",
    "for the three scenarios above , the measured data set is reduced to a vector of observed probabilities for a detection in the relevant basis . in the binomial reconstruction approach",
    ", this corresponds to the probability of a click @xmath31 for each of the experimental values of detection efficiency @xmath32 .",
    "the probability @xmath33 of obtaining @xmath3 output photons depends on the @xmath34 _ and subsequent _ terms of the input state density matrix @xmath11 .",
    "i.e.    @xmath35    incorporating the independent dark count statistics and assuming a binary on / off detector ( typically an spdm ) with a linear response to photon number , eq .",
    "[ eq : pphoton ] may be integrated over the truncated hilbert space to give    @xmath36    corresponding expressions can be obtained for the photon counting and signature approaches from eqs .",

    "the statistical distance between the predicted and measured data sets is quantified .",
    "a correction is thus determined and applied to the current state prediction to create a new estimate .",
    "this process is repeated until either the desired degree of convergence between the datasets is achieved or the incremental changes to the estimated state fall below an arbitrary threshold .",
    "the determination of the optimal means of quantifying the statistical distance between the data sets is an area of ongoing research .",
    "similarly , the calculation of the corresponding amendment to the estimated state is also a non - trivial exercise .",
    "a comparison of the popular contemporary methods of maximum likelihood and maximum entropy approaches are discussed in the context of the inversion of photostatistics data in @xcite .    for our purposes ,",
    "we quantify the distance between the theoretical and measured data sets via the mean square error between the distributions used as a measure of convergence by @xcite . if @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the calculated and observed marginal probability distributions in the basis applicable to the reconstruction category , and @xmath41 is the total data set size ,    @xmath42    the problem may hence be expressed as a multidimensional numerical minimisation problem , where the goal is the minimisation of @xmath43 by appropriate selection of the @xmath44 diagonal coefficients of @xmath11 . for this task , the simplex method of nelder and mead @xcite was chosen for ease of implementation @xcite and the requirement for evaluation of @xmath43 only , and not its derivatives .",
    "although convergence of the algorithm to a global minimum is not guaranteed @xcite , in practice its convergence was found to be fast and entirely adequate for a wide range of expressions for @xmath43 .",
    "the tdm loop detector architecture of @xcite was selected because of its inherent flexibility in permitting a variable number @xmath0 of output modes . the architecture is shown in fig .  [ fig : loopexpt ] .",
    "the experiment allows the various reconstruction methods to be assessed against the poissonian photostatistics of the coherent output of the diode laser .",
    "the laser is biased below threshold , and pulsed briefly into operation by the application of a variable amplitude 20 ns pulse .",
    "95% of the laser output is directed to a nist - traceable newport 3227 power meter for calibration / renormalisation purposes .",
    "the remaining 5% is then transferred via a series of calibrated fibre attenuators providing @xmath45 db of attenuation into the loop detector .",
    "the loop detector comprises the input switch , output coupler and fibre delay loop .",
    "the switch was provided by civcom inc . and provides a remarkably low insertion loss ( 1.2 db ) combined with fast ( 270 ns ) switching speed .",
    "as the fibre provides @xmath46s of delay , the switch thus has adequate time to settle in the alternative state ( shown by the dotted line of fig .",
    "[ fig : loopexpt ] ) after admitting the pulse to the detector .",
    "the loop consists of 2 km of corning smf-28 fibre , exhibiting only 0.8 db loss at 1550 nm , with each coupler exhibiting 0.5db of loss .",
    "the long delay allows for the recovery of the apd used in the spdm following a gate pulse , in order to minimise the detrimental effects of afterpulsing .",
    "a portion of the beam is tapped off from the circulating field via the fibre coupler at each pass and directed onto an id - quantique id-200 spdm operating with a 20 ns gate window and a 100 khz clock rate .",
    "this detector had a quantum efficiency of 10 % and a dark count probability per gate @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 bins was selected with a coupling coefficient @xmath49 , yielding a possible truncation error of @xmath50% @xcite . in practice , this error is not observed due to the excess loop losses preventing photons making it into the last few bins for the range of input intensities employed .",
