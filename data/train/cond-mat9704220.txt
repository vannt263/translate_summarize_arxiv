    "the problem of layered magnetic systems is of interest both from theoretical and practical point of view . here belong , e.g. , quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) perovskites@xcite , ferromagnetic monolayers and ultrathin films@xcite .",
    "such systems possess magnetic transition temperatures which are low in comparison with the intralayer exchange parameter @xmath10 and are determined by magnetic anisotropy and/or interlayer coupling .",
    "the crucial role in the systems with small interlayer coupling ( or anisotropy ) belongs to the temperature crossover from a `` 2d - like '' ( isotropic ) regime to the critical 3d ( or 2d ising ) regime respectively ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) . in the general case",
    "where both interlayer coupling and anisotropy parameter are present , the situation is more complicated : with increasing temperature the 2d - like heisenberg behavior changes to the 2d - ising or 3d - heisenberg one depending on that anisotropy or interlayer coupling dominate , and finally system passes to the 3d ising behavior .",
    "there exist a number of approximations which treat thermodynamics of layered systems .",
    "the standard spin - wave theory ( swt ) describes satisfactorily the region of rather low temperatures only .",
    "somewhat better results can be obtained by taking into account the temperature renormalization of the interlayer coupling parameter and the anisotropy parameter .",
    "the temperature dependence of the anisotropy parameter within the spin - wave theory was considered in refs.@xcite . more systematic way to consider such renormalizations",
    "is the self - consistent spin - wave theory ( sswt)@xcite which was applied to quasi-2d and anisotropic 2d magnets in refs.@xcite .",
    "sswt takes into account the interaction between spin waves in the lowest born approximation .",
    "however , at not too low temperatures this approximation is insufficient . in particular , the values of the ordering temperature in sswt are still too high in comparison with experimental ones , and the critical behavior is quite incorrect .",
    "thus the summation of leading contributions in all orders of perturbation theory should be performed . at the same time , to describe the behavior of the order parameter in the critical region one has to take into consideration fluctuation ( non - spin - wave ) contribution to thermodynamic quantities . ising - like excitations in a classical anisotropic model",
    "were considered in ref.@xcite . at the same time , in the quantum anisotropic case this treatment meets with difficulties@xcite , and 3d fluctuations in the critical region of quasi-2d magnets can not be considered in the approach @xcite too .",
    "a possible way to sum up an infinite sequence of perturbation contributions is the renormalization group ( rg ) analysis .",
    "the rg approach was successfully used to consider the classical isotropic magnets with the space dimensionality @xmath11 @xcite . in this case",
    "the fixed point is small , @xmath12 @xmath13 is the exchange parameter ) , and the standard technique of the @xmath14-expansion can be applied .",
    "physically , this means that the excitation - spectrum picture differs somewhat from the spin - wave one ( as discussed in ref.@xcite , the fluctuation corrections to the excitation spectrum read @xmath15 ) .",
    "the rg method was applied also to quantum 2d isotropic magnets in ref.@xcite .",
    "the scaling behavior in the quasi-2d or anisotropic 2d systems is expected to differ from the isotropic @xmath11 magnet . in these cases",
    "the renormalized value of @xmath16 at the stability point of the rg transformation is not small , which corresponds to above - discussed crossover from the 2d - like heisenberg to 3d heisenberg ( or 2d ising ) critical regime .",
    "thus the rg method does not work when passing to the true critical region .",
    "the latter region should to be considered with account of essentially non - spin - wave ( fluctuation ) excitations .    to take into account non - spin - wave ( fluctuation ) effects it is convenient to use , instead of the original heisenberg model , models with large degeneracy , which enables one to introduce a formall small parameter in the theory . in ref.@xcite",
    "an isotropic quantum quasi-2d antiferromagnet was investigated within the @xmath5 expansion in the quantum @xmath0 model@xcite ( in the heisenberg model , @xmath1 ) .",
    "it was demonstrated that the renormalizations of the interlayer coupling parameter in comparison with the usual spin - wave theory ( or sswt ) determine considerable lowering of the transition point .",
    "the same situation should be expected for 2d anisotropic magnets . at the same time",
    ", the @xmath5 expansion meets with some difficulties at the description of the 2d - like fluctuations in the renormalized - classical temperature region near @xmath17 where the series expansion is performed in powers of @xmath18 rather than @xmath5 @xcite .    thus the rg approach and @xmath5 expansion in the @xmath0 model",
    "are expected to have advantages in different temperature regions .",
    "whereas the first method describes well the 2d - like regime , the @xmath5 expansion treats satisfactorily the critical region .",
    "an advantage of the rg approach in comparison with the technique of the @xmath5 expansion in the @xmath0 model is that it enables one to consider the quantum ferromagnet case where the partition function can not be generalized to arbitrary @xmath19 the rg analysis permits also to treat the classical case , which is difficult within the @xmath5 expansion .",
    "( in the classical case , there is no natural upper cutoff for quasimomenta , which is the temperature in the quantum case , and the original lattice version of the partition function should be considered . )",
    "the heisenberg model can be also considered as a particular case of the @xmath20 model ( or of its continual analog , @xmath21 model ) with @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the @xmath22 limit corresponds to sswt ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , at finite @xmath23 thermodynamics is described in terms of spin - wave picture of the excitation spectrum .",
    "the corresponding @xmath2-expansion contains in the 2d case infrared - divergent terms @xcite and is rather inconvenient . for @xmath24",
    "not close to @xmath25 , this expansion does not enable one to obtain correct values of the critical exponents@xcite .",
    "thus , as well as in rg approach , only the 2d - like isotropic heisenberg region can be considered within the @xmath2-expansion .",
    "furthermore , the results of @xmath21 model to @xmath26-th order in @xmath2 are expected to coincide at @xmath4 with the @xmath27-loop rg analysis for @xmath28 or , equivalently , @xmath29 model ( we do not know a general proof of this statement , but this is true in the @xmath11 case for @xmath30 see ref.@xcite ) .    the simplest one - loop rg analysis was applied earlier to calculation of the curie temperature of anisotropic 2d ferromagnets @xcite . as we shall see below , the results of this work become considerably modified by the two - loop corrections which were not taken into account in ref.@xcite .",
    "the momentum - shell version of the one - loop rg approach in the classical quasi-2d magnets was considered in @xcite .",
    "however , the authors of this paper passed to continual limit in the direction perpendicular to layers , so that results of ref.@xcite at small interlayer coupling have qualitative rather quantitative character .    in the present paper",
    "we consider thermodynamics of the quantum and classical layered magnets with small interlayer coupling and anisotropy within the consistent two - loop rg approach and first - order @xmath5 expansion in the @xmath0 model .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we consider the continual and lattice versions of the @xmath0 model for anisotropic layered ferro- and antiferromagnets . in sect .",
    "3 we apply the renormalization group approach @xcite to the quantum @xmath0 model in the ( isotropic ) 2d - like region ( the classical case is considered in appendix b ) . in sect .",
    "4 we investigate the same problem within the @xmath5 expansion in the @xmath0 model up to the first - order and treat the crossover from the 2d - like to 3d heisenberg ( or 2d ising ) behavior . in sect.5",
    "we summarize our results and compare them with experimental data on layered antiferromagnets .",
    "we consider the heisenberg model with small interlayer coupling and easy - axis anisotropy @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 for a ferromagnet , @xmath34 for an antiferromagnet , @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote nearest neighbors within a layer and for different layers,@xmath37 is the interlayer coupling parameter , @xmath38 are the parameters of the exchange anisotropy and single - site anisotropy respectively .",
    "the partition function of the model ( [ h ] ) can be represented in terms of a path integral over coherent states ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) : @xmath39 \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath40 the three - component unit - length vector field , @xmath41 the vector potential of the unit magnetic monopole , which satisfies the equation @xmath42 @xmath43 and the summation over @xmath44 in ( [ zp ] ) is assumed .",
    "we have also introduced in ( [ zp ] ) the external magnetic field @xmath45 to perform the calculation of spin correlation functions .",
    "the term with the time derivative corresponds to the berry - phase contribution @xcite .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath46 two cases are possible : ( a ) the classical case @xmath47 and ( b ) the quantum case @xmath48 .",

    "the partition function ( [ zcl ] ) coincides with that of the well - known classical nonlinear - sigma model @xcite .",
    "however , if one is interested in thermodynamics in a wide temperature interval ( not only in the critical region ) , the continual limit can not be used since not only long - wave excitations contribute thermodynamic properties .",
    "now we treat the quantum case .",
    "then the temperature plays the role of a natural upper limit cutoff for frequencies of the fluctuations .",
    "thus we may pass to the continual limit within each layer .",
