    "at the american institute of mathematics we often play a lunch time game of bocce in a nearby park .",
    "each round begins with the winner of the previous round tossing the pallino , a small white marker ball , out onto the lawn somewhere . then each player takes turns throwing larger balls as close as possible to the pallino .",
    "winners like to think their good fortune is a result of skill , but we see a lot of variability in the results leading us to conclude that chance plays a major role .",
    "usually the balls cluster around the pallino , but from time to time they do not , and once , when all eight of them were off to one side  so that the pallino was not contained in their convex hull ",
    "i became intrigued with the possibility of figuring out the probability of that occurring .",
    "answering this question leads naturally into other questions that can be answered with the same approach .",
    "one of these questions is about positive solutions of systems of linear equations",
    ". we might be especially interested in positive solutions because the equations are a model for some real world problem where negative values of the variables do not make sense .",
    "suppose that a system of liner equations is drawn out of a hat  that is , the coefficients of the system are random .",
    "what is the probability that there is a positive solution ?",
    "a third question concerns random two - person zero - sum games .",
    "the payoff matrix for such a game is an @xmath0 rectangular matrix of real numbers .",
    "one player chooses a row , the other player a column , and the column player pays the row player the amount of the corresponding matrix entry  a negative number meaning that the row player actually pays the column player .",
    "most of the time players do not have unique best choices , but they do have optimal probabilistic strategies specifying the probabilities for choosing among their options .",
    "it stands to reason that the player having more options is more likely to have the advantage , but can we quantify that ? more precisely , assuming the game matrix has random entries as likely to be positive as negative , what is the probability that the row player expects a positive payoff ?",
    "for each question some special cases are easy to answer , and we begin with those .",
    "\\(1 ) bocce as it is played in this world is a two - dimensional game , but imagine playing bocce in @xmath1 dimensions for any @xmath2 .",
    "the special case of @xmath3 we ll take care of now . place the pallino at the origin on the real line , and assume that the @xmath4 players balls are independent random points with equal probability to be on either side of the origin and zero probability to be exactly at the origin .",
    "then the origin fails to be in the convex hull of the random points exactly when all the points are on the same side of the origin .",
    "the first point can be on either side with the remaining @xmath5 points on the same side as the first point , an event that has probability @xmath6 .",
    "\\(2 ) let s start with a single linear equation in two variables @xmath7 so that the set of solutions is a line in the plane  as long as @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not both 0 .",
    "assume that the @xmath8 and @xmath9 are independent random variables each having probability @xmath10 of being positive , probability @xmath10 of being negative , and probability zero of being 0 .",
    "when @xmath11 , there are two intercepts , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and four possibilities for the signs of the intercepts , each having probability @xmath14 . unless both intercepts are negative , the line will meet the first quadrant and there will be positive solutions",
    ". therefore the probability of a positive solution is @xmath15 .",
    "however , when @xmath16 the solution set is a line through the origin with slope @xmath17 .",
    "the sign of the slope is equally likely to be positive as negative , and so the probability is @xmath10 that the line meets the first quadrant , giving a positive solution .    a similar analysis works for one equation in @xmath4 variables @xmath18 for @xmath11 the probability of a positive solution is @xmath19 , while for @xmath20 the probability is @xmath21 .",
    "\\(3 ) let s consider the game with @xmath22 and arbitrary @xmath4 .",
    "the row player has only one choice , and the column player just picks the smallest entry since he wants to minimize what he pays",
    ". the minimum value will be positive when all @xmath4 entries are positive .",
    "hence , if we assume that the entries are independent and just as likely to be positive as negative and with no chance of being zero , then the probability that they are all positive is @xmath23 , and that is the probability that the row player has the advantage .",
    "we return to the original bocce game as it is played on a two - dimensional surface .",
    "the pallino is at the origin and the players balls are random points @xmath24 in @xmath25 . in actual play , especially with skilled players , the locations of the balls are not independent , because players attempt to knock opponents balls out of the way or to set up blocking positions in front of the pallino . however , our casual game is not played on a smooth bocce court but rather in a park with bumpy terrain , patches of dead lawn , trees , hills , sidewalks , and playground equipment .",
    "the player with the nearest ball on each round begins the next round by throwing the pallino wherever he or she chooses , and so all the irregularities of the terrain make it reasonable to assume that the location of the players balls are independent random points .",
    "the second key assumption is that the probability distribution for each ball has a density function symmetric with respect to the origin . for a probability density function",
    "@xmath26 this means that @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "( we are not requiring that the random points be identically distributed . )",
    "common examples include bivariate normal distributions centered at the origin and uniform distributions on regions such as disks or rectangles centered at the origin .",
    "it follows from this assumption that for any line through the origin , the probability is @xmath10 to be in each of the open half - planes on either side of the line .    with our assumptions in place",
    "let s define @xmath29 to be the event that the origin does not lie within the convex hull of @xmath4 random points @xmath24 .",
    "for such a configuration there is a unique distinguished point among the @xmath4 points with the property that all the remaining points are in the half - plane described by starting at that point and going @xmath30 radians counter - clockwise .",
    "this shows that @xmath29 is the disjoint union of events @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the event that @xmath33 is the distinguished point .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 but @xmath35 because @xmath33 can be anywhere and the other @xmath5 points must be in the correct half - plane .",
    "therefore , @xmath36    this result is consistent with the informal observations in our bocce games in the park .",
    "we usually have four players , each throwing two balls , and so @xmath37 , in which case @xmath38 .",
    "the two - dimensional analysis does not seem to work in three dimensions because there is not a natural way to associate to each nonzero point in @xmath39 a half - space with that point on the separating plane .",
    "the same goes for higher dimensions . but",
    "in 1962 j. g. wendel @xcite found an elegant solution relying fundamentally on an old theorem of l. schlfli that counts the number of regions in @xmath40 created by @xmath4 generic hyperplanes through the origin .",
    "schlfli s result is in _ theorie der vielfachen kontinuitt _ , written between 1850 and 1852 , which is one of the seminal contributions to the development of higher dimensional geometry in the nineteenth century . despite repeated efforts by schlfli and others it was almost 50 years before it was eventually published in 1901 , six years after his death .",
    "schlfli s result can be found in the free google books edition @xcite or in his collected works @xcite .    as wendel puts it , there are @xmath4 points `` scattered at random on the surface of the unit sphere '' in @xmath40 , and the problem is to evaluate the probability that all the points lie on some hemisphere . but this is just what we want , because the origin is not in the convex hull of nonzero points @xmath24 in @xmath40 if and only if the points all lie in some half - space , or equivalently that @xmath41 all lie on some hemisphere of the unit sphere .",
    "what follows is a modified version of wendel s solution .",
    "let @xmath42 be the probability that the convex hull of @xmath4 random points in @xmath40 does not contain the origin ( equivalently , that the points lie in some half - space ) .",
    "we assume that the points @xmath24 are independent and the probability distributions of the points are symmetric with respect to the origin and that they have density functions . for each of the @xmath43 sign vectors @xmath44 ,",
    "we define a random variable @xmath45 .",
    "the value of @xmath45 is @xmath46 if the points @xmath47 all lie in a half - space ; otherwise the value is @xmath48 .",
    "then @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "because the distributions are symmetric with respect to the origin , @xmath51 is independent of @xmath52 , and so @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , @xmath54    the next step is showing that the sum @xmath55 is constant almost surely and that the value of the constant is the number of connected regions in @xmath40 created by the @xmath4 hyperplanes through the origin that are orthogonal to the @xmath33 .",
    "each of the regions corresponds to a sign vector @xmath52 which describes that region as a particular intersection of half - spaces .",
    "that is , two points @xmath56 and @xmath57 are in the same region if and only if the inner products @xmath58 and @xmath59 have the same sign for @xmath60 .",
    "but not all sign vectors correspond to regions because the intersection of half - spaces described by a sign vector can be empty .",
    "now for each @xmath52 that does come from a region , let @xmath56 be a point in the region .",
    "then @xmath61 all lie in the half - space of points @xmath62 such that @xmath63 , and so @xmath64 for the random points @xmath24 . summing over @xmath52",
    "we conclude that @xmath55 is equal to the number of regions .",
    "( there are configurations of the points for which the sum @xmath55 does not achieve this value but is something less .",
    "this occurs when there is some unexpected linear dependence among the @xmath33 . to be precise ,",
    "the exceptional configurations for @xmath65 are those for which @xmath24 are linearly dependent ; for @xmath66 they are those for which some @xmath1 of the points are linearly dependent .",
    "for example , if @xmath67 in @xmath39 all lie in a plane , then the planes normal to them divide space into only 6 regions rather than 8 . )",
    "the last ingredient we need is schlfli s formula for the number of regions . letting @xmath68 denote",
    "the number of regions created by @xmath4 hyperplanes through the origin in @xmath40 , what schlfli proved is that @xmath69 how could you discover this formula ?",
    "well , @xmath68 satisfies the recurrence relation @xmath70 with boundary conditions @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath65 .",
    "the boundary conditions are straightforward , but the recurrence relation is more subtle and is explained in the appendix . with this information",
    "you can compute several values of @xmath68 and then hope to notice that the difference @xmath73 is always twice a binomial coefficient ; in fact , it is @xmath74 . from",
    "that you build the formula , which can then be proved rigorously by showing it satisfies the recurrence relation and boundary conditions .    with this",
    "we have everything we need to see that @xmath75    .values of @xmath76 for @xmath77 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ defaulttable ]     for @xmath77.,width=384 ]    with a little more work we can see that the location of the first ball does not really matter for the result .",
    "that is , you can specify the point @xmath78 , while the other points are random , and the probability that they all lie in a half - space is still @xmath42 . to understand this ,",
    "consider the sum of the @xmath79 random variables @xmath45 where @xmath52 ranges over the sign vectors in @xmath80 such that @xmath81 .",
    "then this sum is equal to the number of sign vectors corresponding to the regions that have @xmath81 .",
    "but there is a one - to - one correspondence between those regions and the regions whose sign vectors have @xmath82 , where the correspondence just pairs a region @xmath83 with its negative @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the sum we want is @xmath85 .",
    "now we divide this by @xmath79 to get the expectation of @xmath86 , which is the probability that we want , but this gives us exactly @xmath87 .",
    "we end this section with the intriguing observation that @xmath88 that is , @xmath42 and @xmath89 are complementary probabilities .",
    "this identity holds for @xmath90 and all integer values of @xmath1 with the understanding that @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "although it is easy to verify algebraically , we will return to it with a geometric proof in the section on random subspaces .",
    "we can use what we already know about convex hulls in order to find the probability that a random system of linear equations has a positive solution .",
    "the key is that the existence of a positive solution for a homogeneous system of linear equations is equivalent to the property that the origin is in the convex hull of the column vectors of the coefficient matrix . here",
    "are the details .",
    "consider an @xmath0 matrix @xmath93 and the system of linear equations written as @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath62 is a solution and @xmath95 are the columns of @xmath93 , then @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath62 is a _ positive _ vector ( meaning that @xmath97 for all @xmath98 and at least one of the @xmath99 is positive ) , then we can multiply @xmath62 by the scalar @xmath100 to get a solution vector @xmath101 with the property that @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and thus @xmath48 is in the convex hull of the @xmath33 .    therefore , if the columns of the matrix @xmath93 are random points in @xmath104 that satisfy the assumptions in the bocce problem , then the probability that @xmath105 has a positive solution is the probability that @xmath4 points in @xmath104 contain the origin in their convex hull , which is @xmath106",
    ". those assumptions are satisfied if the entries of @xmath93 are independent random variables distributed with probability densities that are even functions .",
    "examples include normal distributions and uniform distributions in balanced intervals of the form @xmath107 $ ] .    turning to the random system of equations @xmath108 where @xmath11",
    ", we may consider @xmath109 as a random vector or as a fixed vector , because both lead to the same probability that there is a positive solution .",
    "now suppose there is a positive solution @xmath62 , and let @xmath24 be the columns of @xmath93 . then @xmath110 . move @xmath109 to the other side and scale by @xmath111 to see that @xmath48 is a convex combination of @xmath112 and the @xmath33 .",
    "now we are in the situation of @xmath113 points with one fixed and the rest random , and in the previous section we determined that the probability that they lie in a half - space is @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , the complementary probability @xmath115 is the probability that the origin is in the convex hull .",
    "when the origin is in the convex hull we have an expression of the form @xmath116 with @xmath102 , and we can move @xmath109 back to the right side to show a positive solution for @xmath117 as long as @xmath118 .    let s consider the possibility that @xmath119 in such a convex combination .",
    "then @xmath48 is in the convex hull of the @xmath33 alone .",
    "because any @xmath120 of the @xmath33 are linearly independent and @xmath121 , the convex hull does not lie in a lower dimensional subspace and so it has non - empty interior .",
    "since the probability is zero that the origin is on the boundary of the convex hull , it must be in the interior and so there is an open ball containing the origin and lying within the convex hull . for a sufficiently small @xmath122 ,",
    "the point @xmath123 is in the ball and hence in the convex hull of the @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , there exist @xmath124 such that @xmath125 . multiplying both sides by @xmath126",
    "gives a positive solution of @xmath108 .    in summary ,",
    "the probability of a positive solution of @xmath105 is @xmath127 .",
    "the probability of a positive solution of @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is a fixed or random nonzero vector , is @xmath128 . as a partial check",
    "let s look back at the case of one equation and two unknowns ( @xmath22 and @xmath129 ) for which @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "those values are just what we found earlier . in general , just as in this special case , it is more likely that there is a positive solution when @xmath11 .",
    "since the solutions of the equation @xmath105 form the null space of the matrix @xmath93 , the question about positive solutions becomes a question about the probability that a random subspace of @xmath132 contains a positive vector .",
    "we can assume that the subspaces have a fixed dimension @xmath133 , because the assumptions about the distribution of the entries of @xmath93 imply that @xmath134 , almost surely , so that the null space has dimension @xmath133 .",
    "the orthogonal complement to the null space of @xmath93 is the row space of @xmath93 or the range of @xmath135 , and so it is a subspace of dimension @xmath120 .",
    "that is , a random @xmath120-dimensional subspace of @xmath132 , for @xmath136 , is generated by taking the span of @xmath120 random vectors in @xmath132 . with reasonable assumptions",
    "the vectors will be linearly independent with probability one , thus giving a span of dimension @xmath120 .",
    "what is the probability that a random @xmath120-dimensional subspace of @xmath132 contains a positive vector ?",
    "we ll see that the answer is @xmath137 .",
    "let the random subspace be the row space of the random @xmath0 matrix @xmath93 as before ( the columns are independent random vectors having probability densities symmetric with respect to the origin )",
    ". in particular , the individual entries in @xmath93 could be independent random variables whose probability density functions are even .",
    "now we apply the theorem from linear algebra known as gordan s theorem of the alternative @xcite : a subspace @xmath138 of @xmath132 contains a positive vector if and only if its orthogonal complement @xmath139 does not contain a strictly positive vector .",
    "let @xmath138 be the row space of @xmath93 so that @xmath139 is the null space of @xmath93 .",
    "then the probability that @xmath139 does not contain a strictly positive vector is the same as the probability that it does not contain a positive vector , namely , @xmath140 , which is @xmath137 .",
    "this , then , gives us a geometric explanation for the complementary probability identity mentioned earlier @xmath141 we can understand the result as a _ probabilistic theorem of the alternative _ : with probability one , a random subspace either contains a positive vector or its orthogonal complement contains a positive vector , but not both . in short , complementary subspaces define complementary events .     for @xmath142.,width=288",
    "]    figure 2 shows that for large @xmath4 the value of @xmath137 rises quickly from nearly 0 to nearly 1 as @xmath120 passes through @xmath143 .",
    "as @xmath4 increases the plot becomes more and more like a step function .",
    "note that for @xmath4 even @xmath144 is always @xmath10 .",
    "we end this section with an explanation for the individual binomial probabilities @xmath145 that we see in the sums for @xmath137 .",
    "this , of course , is the probability of exactly @xmath146 heads occurring in a sequence of @xmath5 tosses of a fair coin .",

    "the rows represent the pure strategies of the row player and the columns the pure strategies of the column player , and the convention is that when the row player chooses row @xmath98 and the column player chooses column @xmath146 , the result is that the column player pays the row player the amount @xmath151 .",
    "( if @xmath151 is negative , then the column player receives @xmath152 from the row player . )",

    "in order for the value of the game to be positive , the row player must have a mixed strategy that gives a positive payoff no matter which column the opponent chooses .",

    "what is the probability that there is a positive input with positive output ?",
    "it turns out that we already have the answer to that question from the game theory situation , although in transposed form . asking for a strictly positive output , rather than just a positive ouput , does nt change the probability . for @xmath193 to be strictly positive means that the inner product of @xmath62 with each row of @xmath93 is positive .",
    "if @xmath62 is also positive , then we have the conditions for the game with matrix @xmath135 to have a positive value , and so we conclude that the probability of that occurring is @xmath194 .",

    "<S> a question in geometric probability about the location of the balls in a game of bocce leads to related questions about the probability that a system of linear equations has a positive solution and the probability that a random zero - sum game favors the row player . under reasonable assumptions we are able to find these probabilities </S>"
