    "no significant amount of primordial antimatter is found in the present universe and any initial matter - antimatter asymmetry would have been eliminated by inflation .",
    "these facts lead to the problem of baryon asymmetry in the universe ( bau ) .",
    "we need a baryogenesis mechanism to dynamically generate this bau .",
    "there have been a number of successful baryogenesis scenarios , all of which require new physics beyond the minimal standard model ( sm ) .",
    "furthermore , the phenomena of neutrino oscillations implies that three neutrinos should have different masses and mix with each other .",
    "this again calls for new physics since the neutrinos are massless in the sm .",
    "it would be an interesting progress if the generation of bau and the origin of small neutrino masses can be simultaneously understood in a unified framework .",
    "this actually has been achieved by the so - called seesaw @xcite and leptogenesis @xcite schemes where the lepton number is violated by two units and the neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that the majorana nature of neutrinos has not been confirmed by any experiments .",
    "it has been shown that even if the neutrinos turn out to be dirac particles , one can realize the seesaw and leptogensis mechanisms by introducing additional symmetries besides some heavy degrees of freedom to the theory @xcite .",
    "compared with majorana neutrino models , dirac neutrino models usually do not violate the lepton number , but need more unknown parameters .",
    "in general , for both of majorana and dirac seesaw - leptogenesis scenarios , one does not know much about the texture of the masses and couplings involving the new heavy fields , and hence can not give an unambiguous relation between the bau and the information reside in the neutrino mass matrix , such as mass hierarchy and cp phase(s ) .",
    "the predictive power is quite limited @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall develop a novel scenario where the dirac neutrinos have a seesaw - suppressed hermitian mass matrix and up to an overall scale factor , the baryon asymmetry is determined by the neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices . to construct a realistic model we also aim at the strong cp problem which is another big challenge to the sm .",
    "specifically we shall consider an @xmath0 left - right symmetric @xcite model with a softly broken parity symmetry to solve the strong cp problem without an unobserved axion @xcite .",
    "our leptogenesis also requires the existence of a lepton number violation which , however , is not allowed to contribute any majorana neutrino masses . for this purpose we shall impose an unbroken @xmath1 discrete symmetry . to produce the bau ,",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is required to satisfy a normal hierarchy pattern and contain a sizable dirac cp phase .",
    "our model can be tested in the running and forthcoming neutrino oscillation experiments such as no@xmath2a and juno , and can be excluded by any observations of neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "in this model three generations of fermions and their corresponding @xmath3 quantum numbers are as the following , @xmath4 where the components of the @xmath5 doublets are @xmath6,~ l_{l}^{}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\nu_{l}^{}\\\\ e_{l}^{}\\end{array}\\right],~l_{r}^{}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\nu_{r}^{}\\\\ e_{r}^{}\\end{array}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as we will show later that the new particles @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are heavy .",
    "the scalars in this model are @xmath10 symmetry breaking is driven by nonzero vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of scalars .",
    "one can write down the full renormalizable scalar potential to analyze the breaking pattern in details . here",
    "we will , instead , write down a few of the terms which play some special roles , @xmath11\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when the @xmath12 scalar develops its vev , the @xmath13 symmetry will be broken down to a @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 . naively , if the @xmath16 scalar takes a positive mass @xmath17 , its vev should be zero .",
    "however , due to the @xmath18-term in the above potential , one can get an induced vev , @xmath19 .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath20 and @xmath21 scalars will respectively drive the left - right symmetry breaking @xmath22 and the electroweak symmetry breaking @xmath23 . in order to separate the left - right and electroweak symmetry breaking scales",
    ", we softly break the parity symmetry by taking @xmath24 . as a result of the softly broken parity",
    ", the left - right symmetry breaking scale can be much higher than the electroweak one , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "after the left - right symmetry breaking , the higgs bidoublet @xmath26 can be conveniently treated as two @xmath27 doublets , @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath30 scalars can have a large mass split because of the @xmath31-terms in the potential ( [ potential ] ) . by choosing the masses @xmath32 of @xmath33 positive and very large",
    ", the @xmath34-term and the @xmath35-term in the potential will lead to the induced small vevs for @xmath36 as below , @xmath37 as we will show later a successful leptogenesis requires the vev @xmath38 below the ev scale .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath39 discrete symmetry will not be broken at any scales .",
    "accordingly , the real singlet scalar @xmath40 and the @xmath41$]-triplet scalars @xmath42 will not have any nonzero vevs and the neutrinos will not develop nonzero majorana masses .",
    "fermion masses can be generated at tree level through the yukawa couplings as follows , @xmath43 the parity symmetry , although softly broken , still enforce @xmath44 .",

    "@xmath48 is from the qcd @xmath48-vacuum and should have been removed by the parity symmetry .",
    "the loop - level contribution from the quark mass matrices to the strong cp phase can be below the experimental limit when the new quarks are heavy enough @xcite .",
    "therefore , the strong cp problem can be solved without introducing an unobserved axion .",
    "the lepton mass matrices are very different from those for quarks .",

    "as for the left - handed neutrinos @xmath54 and the right - handed neutrinos @xmath55 , they can form dirac pairs and acquire a hermitian mass matrix , @xmath56 with @xmath57 being the pmns @xcite matrix which now does not contain any majorana cp phases . taking into account the perturbation requirement @xmath58 , the vev @xmath59 should have a low limit .",
    "for the neutrino mass spectrum being normal hierarchy ( nh ) @xmath60 , or inverted hierarchy ( ih ) @xmath61 , we can constrain @xmath62 by inputting the best fitting values @xcite .",
    "after the left - right symmetry is broken down to the electroweak symmetry , the yukawa interactions in eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) will result in @xmath63 therefore , the mirror charged leptons @xmath64 can decay into the ordinary leptons @xmath65 and the heavy higgs scalar @xmath30 if kinematically allowed . evaluating the diagrams in fig .",

    "we find that the above expression is proportional to the jarlskog parameter @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath72 can be written as @xmath73 with @xmath74 note @xmath75 and @xmath76 have the same sign and are sensitive to whether the neutrino masses satisfy the nh or ih pattern .",
    "although these lepton number conserving decays do not generate a net lepton number , they can produce three individual lepton asymmetries @xmath77 stored in the ordinary electron , muon and tau lepton flavors .",
    "since the mirror electron is much lighter than the mirror muon and tau , the decays of the mirror electron - positron pairs can be expected to determine the individual lepton asymmetries @xmath77 .",
    "if the mirror electron and positron are heavy enough , their decays can produce the lepton asymmetries @xmath77 before the sphaleron @xcite processes stop working .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath78$]-triplet scalar @xmath79 can mediate some lepton number violating processes , such as the lepton number violating annihilation shown in fig .",
    "[ scattering ] . for a proper choice of the couplings and mass of the @xmath79 scalar ,",
    "only the lepton number violating interactions of certain lepton flavor(s ) can keep in equilibrium when the individual lepton asymmetries @xmath77 are produced . for this reason a nonzero lepton asymmetry , i.e. @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 or @xmath85 , can survive from the lepton number violating processes .",
    "if this remaining lepton asymmetry is induced before the sphaleron epoch , it can be partially converted to a baryon asymmetry .    the interaction rate of the flavor - dependent lepton number violating processes , from fig .",
    "[ scattering ] , is given by , @xmath86 as an example , we consider the case where only the @xmath82 asymmetry can be quickly washed out once they are produced , if the following conditions are satisfied @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the hubble constant with @xmath89 being the planck mass and @xmath90 being the relativistic degrees of freedom ( the sm fields , the real singlet scalar , the heavy higgs doublet @xmath30 , the right - handed neutrinos ) .",
    "this means that for @xmath91 , the yukawa couplings @xmath92 should take the structure , @xmath93 which may be induced by some symmetry arrangements like the froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite .",
    "the mirror electron mass is above the sphaleron temperature but much below the high left - right symmetry breaking scale .",
    "therefore , the gauge interactions of the mirror electron and positron can go out of equilibrium before the efficient decays of the mirror electron - positron pairs . in the weak washout region ,",
    "the out - of - equilibrium condition of the mirror electron and positron can be simply described by @xmath94 .",
    "the individual lepton asymmetries induced by the decays of the mirror electron - positron pairs then can approximate to @xcite @xmath95 from the out - of - equilibrium condition and the neutrino oscillation data @xcite , we can constrain the vev @xmath59 by @xmath96 \\!\\!2.01\\times 10^{-4}_{}\\,\\textrm{ev}^2_{}\\left(\\frac{1.62\\times 10^{17}_{}\\textrm{gev}}{m_{e_e}^{}}\\right)\\ , , \\textrm{ih with } \\ , m_3^{}=0\\,,\\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is allowed to match the perturbation condition for a large mirror electron mass @xmath97 . in the above , for definitiveness we have taken @xmath98 and @xmath99 for nh and ih , respectively .",
    "these choices give the lower bounds for @xmath100 , and also the upper bounds for @xmath101 which will be shown later in eq .",

    "the final baryon asymmetry then should be @xcite @xmath102 here the factor @xmath103 is the lepton - to - baryon conversion coefficient @xcite . by inputting the known neutrino oscillation data @xcite into the cp asymmetries ( [ cpae ] ) , which do not have any cancellations between @xmath75 and @xmath76",
