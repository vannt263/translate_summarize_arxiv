    "anomalous x - ray pulsars are an unusual class of astrophysical objects .",
    "there are currently only five confirmed axps : 4u  0142 + 61 , 1e  1048.15937 , 1e  1841045 , rxs  j170849.0400910  ( hereafter 1rxs  17084009 ) , and 1e  2259.1 + 586 .",
    "all five are located in the galactic plane and two ( 1e  2259.1 + 586  and 1e  1841045 ) are coincident with supernova remnants . a sixth axp candidate , ax  j1845.00258 , is also coincident with a supernova remnant @xcite .    the observational properties of axps ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) are generally quite different from those of conventional accreting binary x - ray pulsars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein for a compendium of accreting x - ray pulsar properties ) . in particular , axps have spin periods in the narrow 612  s range , while accreting x - ray pulsars have periods that span 0.0021400  s. axps have luminosities in the narrow range @xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 . by comparison , typical accreting x - ray pulsars",
    "are extremely variable , with luminosities spanning a much broader range ( @xmath7  erg  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "axp spectra are considerably softer than those of the typical accreting pulsar . accreting pulsar spectra",
    "are generally well described as a power law with a cut - off in the 1020  kev range .",
    "axp spectra , by contrast , are generally characterized by a blackbody spectrum of energy @xmath8  kev , with a hard energy excess that can be characterized by a steep power law of index @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "the timing properties of axps also contrast sharply with those of most accreting pulsars .",
    "all of the known axps , as we show in this paper , appear to be undergoing steady , prolonged spin - down , though some are more steady than others . by comparison",
    ", most accreting pulsars are spinning up ( on average ) , or alternating between spin - up and spin - down , and have poor rotational stability .",
    "most importantly , the axps show no evidence for a binary companion .",
    "specifically , the limits on the x - ray / optical flux ratio in axps rule out the presence of massive companions as in the conventional high - mass x - ray binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , careful pulse timing of axps has failed to detect any evidence for binary motion of the neutron star on time scales of a few minutes to several days @xcite .",
    "the limits imply that only extremely low - mass companions are allowed in these systems , unless we are observing all axps face - on , which is unlikely .",
    "furthermore , mass - transferring low - mass companions are also unlikely because the supernova remnant associations imply youth , and because these systems rarely survive the supernova .",
    "currently , models for axps fall into two distinct categories .",
    "one class of models is that axps are young , isolated , ultra - magnetized neutron stars or `` magnetars '' @xcite . if the spin - down of the pulsar is primarily due to magnetic dipole radiation , then the axps have enormous surface magnetic dipolar fields , in the range @xmath11  g. the identification with magnetars is further strongly motivated by the similarity of the axp emission to that of the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) in quiescence .",
    "specifically , the latter have similar pulse periods , are spinning down @xcite , and have x - ray spectra that are comparable to , though somewhat harder than , those of the axps , at least when not in outburst @xcite .",
    "independent evidence for the ultra - high magnetic fields exists in sgrs ; for example , a @xmath12  g magnetic field is required to contain the radiation that is seen following major outbursts @xcite .",
    "the second category of model proposed to explain axp emission is that they are accreting from a disk of material leftover from the supernova explosion that created the neutron star @xcite .",
    "fall - back disks around neutron stars have been proposed in other contexts @xcite ; here , the axps represent a single , short - lived phase in the evolution of a neutron star having magnetic field only slightly larger than those of radio pulsars . in this phase ,",
    "the neutron star is in a propeller mode in which the inner edge of the accretion radius lies between the magnetospheric and corotation radii .",
    "this model , in its original version @xcite , significantly overpredicted the expected optical / ir flux from the fall - back disk @xcite .",
    "a more recent version includes the effects of a thermal disk instability which may prevent the disk from expanding radially , hence allowing it to remain sufficiently dim to be consistent with the optical / ir limits @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , difficulties remain with the accretion model . in particular , although the noise properties of a fall - back disk are currently unknown , the extremely steady spin down of two axps ( kaspi , chakrabarty & steinberger 1999 ) is at odds with that seen in most x - ray pulsars that definitely have accretion disks ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , very noisy timing behavior seen in one axp ( 1e  1048.15937 ) shows no evidence for correlated flux variations , as are expected in fall - back disk accretion models @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we present a variety of observational results from our program of regular monitoring observations of axps with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer . _",
    "we make use of dedicated as well as archival monitoring observations spanning several years for three axps .",
    "initial results from this program were presented elsewhere ( kaspi et al .",
    "1999 , kaspi , lackey & chakrabarty 2000 ) and focused on the timing properties of 1rxs  17084009  and 1e  2259.1 + 586 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite present results for axps 1e  1048.15937  and 1e  1841045 , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we report for the first time on 4u  0142 + 61 , and update timing results for 1rxs  17084009  and 1e  2259.1 + 586 .",
    "in addition , we use the same data sets to study pulse morphology variability and energy dependence , as well as the stability of the pulsed flux .",
    "our goal is to clarify important observational properties of axps in the hope of offering new , quantitative data for use in testing axp models .",
    "the results presented here were obtained using the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "the pca consists of an array of five collimated xenon / methane multi - anode proportional counter units operating in the 2    60  kev range , with a total effective area of approximately @xmath13 and a field of view of @xmath14  fwhm .",
    "our observations consist primarily of short snapshots taken on a monthly basis ( see table  [ ta : exposures ] ) .",
    "in addition , we used a handful of archival observations ; the exposures in these observations vary from very short ( @xmath15  ks ) to very long ( @xmath16  ks ; see table  [ ta : exposures ] ) .",
    "we used the ` goodxenonwithpropane ` data mode , which records photon arrival times with 1-@xmath17s resolution and bins energies into one of 256 channels . due to the soft spectrum of these sources",
    ", we analyzed only events from the top xenon layer of each pcu .",
    "photon arrival times at each epoch were adjusted to the solar system barycenter , and binned with 31.25-ms time resolution .",
    "in the timing analysis , we included only those events having energies in a predetermined range so as to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio of the pulse .",
    "the energy cuts used were 2.5    9.0  kev for 4u  0142 + 61  and 1e  2259.1 + 586  and 2.2    5.5  kev for 1rxs  17084009 .",
    "each binned time series was epoch - folded using the best estimate frequency determined initially from either a periodogram or fourier transform ( though later folding was done using the timing ephemeris determined by maintaining phase coherence ; see below ) .",
    "resulting pulse profiles were cross - correlated in the fourier domain with a high signal - to - noise template created by adding phase - aligned profiles from previous observations .",
    "the templates are shown in figure  [ fig : templates ] along with their respective fourier transforms in figure  [ fig : fft_templates ] .",
    "the cross - correlation returns an average pulse time - of - arrival ( toa ) for each observation corresponding to a fixed pulse phase .",
    "the pulse phase @xmath18 at any time @xmath19 can be expressed as a taylor expansion ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the pulse frequency , @xmath22 , etc . , and subscript ` @xmath23 ' denotes a parameter evaluated at the reference epoch @xmath24 .",
    "the toas were fit to the above polynomial using the pulsar timing software package ` tempo ` .",
    "unambiguous pulse numbering is made possible by obtaining monitoring observations spaced so that the best - fit model parameters have a small enough uncertainty to allow prediction of the phase of the next observation to within @xmath25 .",
    "typically this requires two closely spaced observations ( within a few of hours of each other ) followed by one spaced a few days later , and regular monitoring thereafter , as long as phase coherence can be maintained .    to minimize use of telescope time while maximizing precision , our monitoring data consisted of frequent brief snapshots of each pulsar ( table  [ ta : exposures ] ) .",
    "these snapshots suffice to measure toas to good precision .",
    "however , at each epoch , the period as determined by a fourier transform or epoch - folding has typical uncertainty of a few milliseconds .",
    "thus , snapshots can determine spin parameters with high precision only when phase coherence can be maintained .    for 4u  0142 + 61 , we report here for the first time a phase - coherent timing solution that indicates that this axp has been an extremely stable rotator over 4.4  yr of _ rxte _ monitoring",
    ". however , a 2-yr gap in the data precludes unambiguous absolute pulse numbering ; we find two equally viable phase - connections that differ by one pulse .",
    "unambiguous phase count can be maintained in 1.3 and 1.4-yr segments at the beginning and end of the 4.4-yr span , respectively .",
    "phase residuals after subtraction of spin - down models that include @xmath0 and @xmath1 only in the first and second segments have rms of 2.7% and 1% of the pulse period , respectively , and are featureless .",
    "the best - fit model parameters for each segment , as well as the two indistinguishable models for the entire 4.4-yr span , are given in table  [ ta : timing0142 ] .",
    "timing residuals for solution `` a '' ( see table  [ ta : timing0142 ] ) are shown in figure  [ fig : res0142 ] ; those for solution `` b '' are qualitatively similar .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with frequency measurements made for this pulsar with various x - ray telescopes over the past @xmath420  yr . figure  [ fig : freq0142 ] shows these data ( taken from @xcite @xcite ) along with our _ rxte _ ephemeris .",
    "the top panel shows @xmath0 versus time ; the thick solid line is our phase - connected ephemeris ( the distinction between a and b is not visible on this plot ) over the 4.4-yr span _ rxte _ has monitored it , while the thin line is the extrapolation of our ephemeris backward .",
    "the uncertainties are smaller than the thickness of the lines .",
    "the bottom panel shows the same data but with the linear and offset trend removed .",
    "all but one data point ( taken with exosat ) agree with the back - extrapolation .",
    "that one point suggests that the pulsar may exhibit deviations from a simple spin - down law ; these could be due to random noise processes or glitches .",
    "further observations can test this .    for 1rxs  17084009",
    ", phase coherent timing has been accomplished in the 1.4  yr since the glitch reported by @xcite . in these data",
    ", we find a significant positive @xmath2 ( see table  [ ta : timing ] ) .",
    "this indicates a decay of the negative @xmath1 , expected for long - term glitch recovery , as seen in glitching radio pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "phase residuals after subtraction of the best fit model are shown in figure  [ fig : res1708 ] .",
    "we note that the value for @xmath1 reported in table  2 is different by @xmath26 from that reported by @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to the unmodeled influence of @xmath2 in the earlier , shorter data set .",
    "the rotational stability of 1e  2259.1 + 586 , first reported by @xcite , has now persisted over 4.5  yr , although the inclusion of @xmath2 has been necessary .",
    "phase residuals after subtraction of a simple model that includes only @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 have rms under 1% of the pulse period ( see table  [ ta : timing ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : res1708 ] ) .",
    "we note the presence of very low - level systematic trends in the most recent data ; their origin is unknown .      to search for pulse profile changes ,",
    "the profiles were first phase aligned using the templates and the same cross - correlation procedure used for timing .",
    "each data profile ( @xmath27 ) was fit to the template ( @xmath28 ) by adjusting two parameters , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , to minimize a @xmath31 statistic , where    @xmath32    here @xmath33 is the number phase bins , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the errors associated with @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the resulting data profile was subtracted from the template to yield `` profile residuals '' for each observation .    to search for pulse profile variations , using the optimal @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    ", we calculated the probability of each @xmath36 statistic given their expected distribution and the number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the procedure was repeated for each pulsar with @xmath38 in order to have sensitivity to a variety of types of pulse profile changes .",
    "we have not detected any large pulse profile variations .",
    "this justifies our other analysis procedures which assume a fixed profile .",
    "however , in a handful of observations , we have found evidence for low - level pulse profile changes , at the @xmath39 level for all three sources .",
    "these are intriguing ; however at this level , they require confirmation using longer monitoring observations .",
    "it is difficult to set quantitative upper limits on the amplitude of pulse profile changes to which we were sensitive , as these depend on the shape of the change , and vary depending on the length of the observation .",
    "typically , rms profile residuals are @xmath420% of the pulse peak , although this varied from 440% .",
    "@xcite reported a significant change in the pulse morphology of 1e  2259.1 + 586  in 1.214  kev _ ginga _ observations obtained in 1990 , such that the leading pulse had amplitude roughly half that of the trailing pulse ( compare with fig .",
    "[ fig : templates]c ) .",
    "if correct , this has important implications for the magnetar model , which only predicts such pulse morphology changes in the event of a restructuring of the magnetic field , as might occur following a major sgr - like outburst .",
    "although it is difficult to quantify upper limits on the amplitude of pulse profile changes generally , we have done monte carlo simulations to see whether we were sensitive to the same change observed by @xcite .",
    "in particular , using the original 1990 _ ginga _ pulse profile ( kindly supplied to us by b. paul and f. nagase ) with random poisson - deviated noise added , we repeated our pulse change morphology analysis as described above .",
    "our simulations show that we would have detected the change with high ( @xmath4099% ) confidence in 25% of our observations ( those with integration times @xmath4110  ks ) , and with moderate ( @xmath4090% ) confidence in 45% of our observations ( those with integration times of @xmath417  ks ; see table  [ ta : exposures ] ) .",
    "axp spectra are generally best fit by a two - component model consisting of a photoelectrically absorbed blackbody with a hard power - law tail @xcite .",
    "whether these two components are physically distinct is an open question . to investigate this , we compared the pulse profile morphology in two energy bands , 24  kev and 68  kev .",
    "these were chosen because the 24  kev band has a significant blackbody component ( @xmath42 of total flux , depending on source and model ) and the 68  kev band is greatly dominated by the power - law component ( @xmath43  of total flux ) .",

    "note that the scaling in these plots was chosen to minimize the @xmath31 of the difference between the soft and hard profiles .",
    "thus the only information that these plots convey is the relative amplitudes of the features of the profile .",
    "the minimization of the @xmath31 statistic ( eq .  [ eq : chi ] ) between profiles in the two energy bands was done in the same manner as for the pulse morphology changes ( see  [ sec : morph ] ) .",

    "fig : energy ]  and  [ fig : fft_energy ] it is clear that all three of the axp pulse profiles vary significantly as a function of energy , but to different degrees .      given the large field - of - view of the pca , the low count rates for the sources relative to the background , and the fact that , for example , 1e  2259.1 + 586  is in a supernova remnant , total flux measurements are difficult with our _ rxte _  data .",
    "instead , we have determined the pulsed component of the flux , by using the off - pulse emission as a background estimator .",
    "data from each observing epoch were folded at the expected pulse period as was done for the timing analysis . however , for the flux analysis , 16 phase bins were used across the pulse .",
    "for each phase bin , we maintained a spectral resolution of 128 bins over the pca range .",
    "given the broad morphologies of the average pulse profile , only one phase bin could be used as a background estimator .",
    "the pulse profiles were then phase aligned , so that the same off - pulse bin was used for background in every case .",
    "the remaining phase bins were summed , and their spectral bins regrouped using the ` ftool ` ` grppha ` , such that no bin had fewer than 20 counts after background subtraction .",

    ". in particular , in @xmath60  g magnetic fields , the emission from a surface patch can be highly and non - radially beamed .",
    "furthermore , if the surface distribution itself is non - isotropic , axp profiles may be reproduceable .",
    "indeed , zel , psaltis & kaspi ( 2001 ) show that axp pulsed fractions and luminosities can only be reproduced , assuming thermal emission from the surface of a magnetar propagating through a hydrogen atmosphere , with a single hot spot .",
    "in addition , thompson , lyutikov & kulkarni ( 2001 ) argue that axp pulse profiles can be accounted for even if the surface emission were isotropic , because of resonant scattering off charged particles in the magnetosphere , which has anisotropic optical depth .",

    "there is a possible rough trend in which sources with the least harmonic content ( 1e  1048.15937 , 1e  1841045 ) show the least energy dependence . however the lack of strong pulse morphology evolution with energy in 1e  2259.1 + 586  compared with 1rxs  17084009  does not obviously support this .",
    "another possibly interesting trend is that for the sources in which the ratio of the fourier amplitudes of the second and first harmonics is large ( 1e  2259.1 + 586 ,",
    "4u  0142 + 61 ) , the ratio is largest at low energies .",
    "this manifests itself in the profile plots as the ratio of peak heights being closer to unity in the hard band than in the soft , which is true of 1rxs  17084009  as well .    whether and how these observations can constrain models remains to be seen .",
    "@xcite shows that , when photon propagation through a magnetar atmosphere is properly modeled , the angular dependence of the emission has two components : a narrow pencil beam at small angles with respect to the surface normal , and a broad fan beam at large angles .",
    "she shows that the importance and opening angle of the pencil beam increases with increasing photon energy .",
    "this may be able explain the observed change in the relative peak amplitudes as a function of photon energy , especially in 1rxs  17084009 , if part of the pulse is from a fan beam and part from a pencil beam . however detailed pulse profile modeling is required .",
    "the pulsed fluxes of all known axps are roughly constant , with rms fluctuations of at most @xmath42030% of the mean ( @xmath3 ) ( see table  [ ta : flux ] , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) . past studies of the flux stability of two axps , 1e  2259.1 + 586  and 1e  1048.15937 , have suggested that their phase - averaged fluxes are highly variable , with fluctuations possibly as large as a factor of ten @xcite .",
    "large flux variations , particularly on time scales under a year and in the absence of torque variations , are unexpected in the magnetar model .",
    "this is because in this model , x - rays come from the hot surface where the heat is maintained by the decay of the interior magnetic field . as the thermal conduction time from core to surface",
    "is roughly a year @xcite , flux variations on shorter time scales are hard to explain in the absence of burst activity as is seen in the sgrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with the caveat that we measure pulsed flux while other studies",
    "measured total flux , it is surprising that we find such flux stability in our observations given past claims .",
    "@xcite argued that the flux stability of 1e  2259.1 + 586  is a result of its currently being in a quiescent accreting state that is also characterized by timing stability ( see also ",
    "[ sec : disc_timing ] ) . though we can not rule this out , we point out that ( i ) the same coincidence would have to be true of 1e  1048.15937  for flux stability , ( ii ) the pulsed fluxes of 4u  0142 + 61 , 1rxs  17084009  and 1e",
    "1841045  are also stable , and ( iii ) the pulsed flux of 1e  1048.15937  is stable even though it shows unstable timing behavior , which argues that the flux stability is independent of spin - down behavior .",
    "we note that our flux measurements , in contrast to past studies , have been made using a single instrument , single bandpass , and analysis method , which eliminates the difficulty in comparing measurements made with different instruments , different spectral ranges , and different analysis methods .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the variable x - ray pulsar ax  j1845.00258  which is at the center of the supernova remnant g29.6 + 0.1 may also be an axp .",
    "this source has shown variations in its x - ray luminosity by a factor of @xmath410 between observations taken 6  yr apart .",
    "given that the pulsed fluxes of all known axps are stable , the interpretation of ax  j1845.00258  as a _",
    "bona fide _",
    "axp is therefore questionable .",
    "we have presented a variety of observational results for three anomalous x - ray pulsars , 4u  0142 + 61 , 1rxs  17084009  and 1e  2259.1 + 586 , obtained using regular monitoring observations and archival observations from the pca aboard _",
    "rxte_. our results , combined with those for 1e  1048.15937  and 1e  1841045  @xcite , provide significantly improved descriptions of axp x - ray properties that can be used to test models for the nature of these sources .",
    "specifically , with our successful phase - coherent timing of 4u  0142 + 61 , the detailed timing properties of all known axps are now established and can be compared .",
    "we find a wide variety of timing behaviors , ranging from high stability ( in 1e  2259.1 + 586  and 4u  0142 + 61 ) , to instabilities so severe that phase - coherent timing is not possible ( in 1e  1048.15937 ) .",
    "we note that timing stability appears correlated with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "if this trend is real , it suggests a continuum of timing properties between the axp and sgr populations , lending additional support to the connection between them .",
    "we note that a correlation between timing instability and spin - down rate has long been recognized among radio pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting a connection between all three populations .",
    "we have also used the _ rxte _",
    "data to investigate a variety of other axp properties .",
    "motivated by a report of a significant change in pulse morphology in 1e  2259.1 + 586  in 1990 @xcite , we searched for changes in the pulse morphology at each epoch for all targets .",
    "we find no significant pulse morphology variations .",
    "typically , we rule out variations in features having amplitude @xmath4120% of the peak amplitude at the @xmath3 level , although the limit depends on source and integration time .    we have presented high signal - to - noise average pulse profiles for each axp , and considered them as a function of energy .",
    "we show that , as in the timing properties , there is a variety of different behaviors for the energy dependence .",
    "possible trends include a greater energy dependence for pulses profiles having greater harmonic content , and , for the latter sources , relative peak amplitudes tending closer to unity as photon energy increases .",
    "detailed modeling of axp pulse profiles , in addition to their pulsed fractions and luminosities @xcite can test models in which the emission is from the surface of a cooling magnetar @xcite .",
    "finally , we use the monitoring and archival data to obtain pulsed flux time series for each source .",
    "we have found no large changes in pulsed flux for any source , and have set @xmath3 upper limits on variations @xmath42030% ( depending on the source ) .",
    "this is surprising given previous reports of large ( factor of 510 ) total flux variations in 1e  2259.1 + 586  and 1e  1048.15937  @xcite .",
    "assuming a constant pulsed fraction , this suggests that more than one of the axps happen to be much more quiescent during the _ rxte _ monitoring than in the past .",
