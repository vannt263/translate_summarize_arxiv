    "the use of symanzik improvement  @xcite of lattice actions and matrix elements is widespread and very effective .",
    "however , with each improvement term added the corresponding coefficient must be determined to enable discretisation effects to be reduced to the desired level .",
    "considering the light hadron spectrum and matrix elements , the relevant @xmath0 improvement coefficients are , for the most part , only known to @xmath6-loop in perturbation theory , leaving residual @xmath7 discretisation terms .",
    "a nonperturbative determination of these coefficients is desirable to completely remove @xmath0 effects .",
    "such a determination is possible through the imposition of the axial ward identities  ( awi ) on the lattice .",
    "central to a programme of determining @xmath0 improvement coefficients nonperturbatively is the calculation of @xmath1 , the improvement coefficient of the axial - vector current ; the improved current appears in the expression for the generic axial ward identity and @xmath1 must be determined before other operator improvement coefficients can be calculated  @xcite .",
    "so far , two groups , the lanl group  @xcite and the alpha collaboration  @xcite , have calculated @xmath1 along with several other improvement coefficients .",
    "their results for @xmath1 at @xmath4 and @xmath8 are summarised in figure  [ falpha ] and compared with 1-loop perturbation theory  ( using @xmath9  @xcite ) .",
    "while the results are compatible on the finer lattice , there is a big difference in the values for @xmath4 .",
    "this difference can be explained by the @xmath0 ambiguity which exists in nonperturbative determinations of @xmath0 improvement coefficients .",
    "as long as the improvement conditions for each determination are applied consistently as @xmath2 changes , differences in the value of @xmath1 are not important in principle ; the difference will disappear in the continuum limit .    in practice , different values of @xmath1 can have a large effect away from the continuum limit .",
    "this is because the matrix elements appearing at @xmath0 for @xmath5 and the renormalised quark mass are numerically large compared to the leading order term . @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "an @xmath0 ambiguity in @xmath1 therefore appears at @xmath12 but multiplied by a large matrix element and it is undesirable to have large @xmath12 scaling violations , even if @xmath0 errors have been removed .",
    "our aim is to investigate how well @xmath1 is determined using the lanl method .",
    "the latter only requires a conventional analysis , which is available from simulations performed for spectroscopic calculations , compared to using the schrdinger functional techniques of the alpha collaboration . with significantly higher statistics than those of reference  @xcite we are able to improve on the lanl analysis by performing correlated fits , investigating the choice of lattice derivatives employed more widely and determining the stability of the lanl results to changes in the fitting range .",
    "in addition , we study the scaling behaviour of @xmath5 and the renormalised quark mass with respect to the choice made for @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ capcac ] we outline how to extract @xmath1 from the pcac relation and in particular the method employed by the lanl group .",
    "results are presented in section  [ caresults ] , which includes a comparison of our results with those of the lanl group and the alpha collaboration .",
    "the scaling of @xmath5 and the renormalised quark mass is dealt with in section  [ scalingsec ] , followed by the conclusions in section  [ conc ] .",
    "technical details not directly related to the method of calculating @xmath1 - the simulation details , extracting meson masses and decay constants , the renormalisation factors used to obtain @xmath5 and @xmath13 and the chiral extrapolations are all given in the appendix .",
    "the pcac relation in euclidean space can be written as @xmath14 and should hold on the lattice for all @xmath15 not coincident with @xmath16 up to discretisation terms .",
    "the axial - vector current , @xmath17 , is given by @xmath18 , the pseudoscalar operator @xmath19 and @xmath16 is any operator with the pseudoscalar quantum numbers .",
    "@xmath20 is the bare current quark mass . for simplicity we sum over position space , restricting ourselves to zero momentum , and",
    "define @xmath21 thus , equation  [ pcac ] becomes @xmath22 this relation holds for all states  ( ground and radial excitations ) of the pseudoscalar meson . in the limit of large times , when only the ground state contributes to @xmath23 , then @xmath24 is a constant given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the discretisation errors associated with the ground state . at earlier times , when excited states make a significant contribution  ( with different discretisation errors ) , @xmath24 becomes time dependent , as can be seen in figure  [ mfig ] .",
    "the size of the discretisation terms  ( and the time dependence of @xmath24 ) are reduced to @xmath12 when we improve the axial - vector current   using the sheikholeslami - wohlert term with the value of @xmath27 determined nonperturbatively . ]",
    "@xmath28 then @xmath29 with @xmath30 clearly , changing @xmath16 or the time @xmath31 changes the size of the contribution of each state to @xmath23 , and the size of @xmath0 terms .",
    "the improvement term must still cancel these terms , however , giving rise to a quark mass which differs from @xmath32 only in @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath33 or @xmath34 by forcing @xmath35 and @xmath36 to be equal we can solve for @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath37 a suitable choice for @xmath31 and @xmath38 is to set @xmath39 in the region where the ground state dominates @xmath23 and @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the region where there is significant contribution from excited states .    in order to illuminate the @xmath0 ambiguity in @xmath1 ,",

    "thus , the @xmath0 ambiguity in @xmath1 depends on the difference of the @xmath12  ( and @xmath0 ) terms between @xmath44 at @xmath45 and @xmath46 rather than the absolute values",
    ". obviously if @xmath47\\sim\\delta r_j[o(a)]$ ] , the error in @xmath1 will be as large as @xmath1 itself  ( and the above expansion will not be valid ) .",
    "the lanl method is equivalent to using equation  [ calanl ] .",
    "it involves performing a fit to @xmath48 and @xmath49 such that @xmath50 is equal to a constant  ( @xmath51 ) , where @xmath1 and @xmath51 are parameters in the fit .",
    "the fitting range is chosen to be from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "the advantage of performing a fit over calculating the ratio in equation  [ calanl ] is that one can test the ansatz that the value of @xmath1 reduces the time dependence of @xmath48  ( and hence the discretisation errors ) with the @xmath52 .",
    "we note that the alpha collaboration employs a slightly different method to calculate @xmath1 . within the schrdinger functional approach it is possible to simply work in the region when the ground state dominates and @xmath23 and @xmath40",
    "have plateaued .",
    "the boundary fields are varied and this changes the discretisation errors in the ground state .",
    "a ratio similar to equation  [ calanl ] is built up from @xmath23 and @xmath40 from different boundary fields .",
    "a feature of using the schrdinger functional technique is that the analysis can be performed at directly zero quark mass .",
    "the unknown @xmath0 ambiguity in @xmath1 is due to @xmath12 errors in the axial - vector current , the pseudoscalar current and the light quark action .",
    "the improvement scheme which we have chosen defines @xmath1 in the limit of zero quark mass , however , @xmath1 is calculated at finite @xmath53 and then extrapolated . there is an additional @xmath0 ambiguity due to the discretisation chosen for the temporal derivatives in equations  [ er ] and  [ es ] , which is proportional to @xmath53 and vanishes in the chiral limit . as part of our analysis we investigated two different choices for the lattice derivatives in the determination of @xmath1 : `` standard '' symmetric lattice derivatives @xmath54 which contain @xmath12 errors , and `` improved '' @xmath55 derivatives @xmath56 ^ 2\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "two points should be taken into account when choosing the form for the derivatives .",
    "as one improves the derivatives then the minimum value that @xmath45 can take becomes larger since there must be no overlap with the origin .",
    "in addition , noise rapidly dominates the determination of @xmath1 as @xmath45 increases and there is only a small window of timeslices from which to extract @xmath1 .",
    "the lanl group considered another form of @xmath12 lattice derivative  @xcite which has smaller @xmath12 terms compared to eqns  [ norm ] but uses fewer timeslices than the @xmath55 derivatives . while the different definitions give consistent results for @xmath1 in the chiral limit , we found using improved derivatives helped in extracting @xmath1 .",
    "this point is discussed in the next section .",
    "in addition to the lanl method and equation  [ calanl ] we considered extracting @xmath1 by changing @xmath16 from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "the change in @xmath16 does not give rise to significantly different discretisation effects and the determination of @xmath1 was not improved . in the following we set @xmath61 and drop the subscript on @xmath44 and @xmath62 .",
    "we also used the lanl method with finite momentum correlators in @xmath44 and @xmath62  ( including the additional spatial derivative terms ) .",
    "however , at finite momentum the @xmath0 errors in @xmath1 are increased and no additional constraint on the coefficient is obtained compared to the zero momentum results .",
    "we have tested the lanl method using the ukqcd quenched data set .",
    "the simulation details are given in table  [ sim ] and discussed in the appendix .",
    "the best analysis was possible at @xmath63 .      to implement the lanl method we first fix @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ fexp1 ] shows the fractional contribution of the ground state to the correlators which appear in @xmath44 and @xmath62 with @xmath64 for the two types of correlators , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , that are available for this data set  ( see appendix  [ multifits ] ) .",
    "the ground state dominates by approximately timeslice 12 for all correlators .",
    "we use @xmath67 and as a check also @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath45 is allowed to vary in the region @xmath69 while being careful to avoid any overlap with the origin .",
    "we present the details of the calculation of @xmath1 for the heaviest @xmath70 using standard , @xmath12 , derivatives in table  [ tone ] .",
    "the differences , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , are well determined for @xmath45 close to the origin , but rapidly decrease and become dominated by noise as @xmath45 increases to around timeslice 8 .",
    "the ratio of equation  [ calanl ] agrees with the results obtained using a fit apart from @xmath73 .",
    "however , the lanl fit does not give a reasonable @xmath74  ( defined as @xmath75 ) until timeslice @xmath76 for @xmath66 correlators and @xmath77 for @xmath65 correlators .",
    "the lanl method is expected to achieve good fits in a region where the @xmath12 errors in @xmath35  ( equation  [ pcacimp ] ) are not rapidly changing . in this region ,",

    "any difference between the results from the @xmath65 or @xmath66 correlators means that @xmath12 contributions to @xmath44 and @xmath62 are appearing in @xmath1 .",
    "the results from the lanl fits , with reasonable @xmath74s , are shown in figure  [ figt ] .",
    "@xmath1 is stable with @xmath45  ( possibly excluding @xmath80 for @xmath66 correlators ) , although noise rapidly dominates as the fitting range becomes smaller .",
    "there is agreement between the values obtained using @xmath66 and @xmath65 correlators , and @xmath67 and @xmath81 .",
    "we can compare the range over which a good fit is found with the fractional contribution of the sum of the ground and first excited state to the correlators which make up @xmath44 and @xmath62 , shown in figure  [ fexp1 ] .",
    "roughly , the earliest @xmath45 with @xmath75 corresponds to the timeslice when all but the first excited state and the ground state dominate the correlators ; since the @xmath66 correlators have a lower contribution from excited states , the ground state plus first excited state dominate at an earlier timeslice compared to the @xmath65 correlators and a smaller @xmath45 can be used .",
    "the results change quite significantly when we switch to improved derivatives .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the effects of changing the derivatives on @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath65 correlators .",
    "clearly , the time dependence of @xmath24 is much reduced in the range @xmath84 when improved lattice derivatives are used , indicating that most of the discretisation effects seen when using the standard derivatives are due to the @xmath12 error in @xmath79 associated with this derivative and not the @xmath0 errors which we are trying to cancel with @xmath78 .",
    "a similar but much less dramatic effect is seen for @xmath83 .",
    "this translates into much smaller values for @xmath72 , @xmath71 and @xmath1 , as seen in table  [ ttwo ] and figure  [ figt ] .    for both @xmath65 and @xmath66 correlators ,",
    "reasonable fits can be obtained with slightly smaller @xmath45 than with standard derivatives , suggesting @xmath85 $ ] in this region is not large . as figure  [ figt ] shows ,",
    "there is agreement to within @xmath86 between the @xmath65 and @xmath66 results , with the exception of the fit to @xmath65 correlators with @xmath87 , which disagrees significantly with the @xmath66 result over the same fitting range .",
    "this is presumably due to a larger @xmath0 in @xmath1 for the @xmath65 result , since these correlators have a larger contribution from first excited  ( and higher ) states .",
    "this fit is on the borderline of being considered reasonable ; changing @xmath46 to @xmath81 , the @xmath74 drops further .",
    "we demonstrate the effect of @xmath0 improvement on @xmath88 , for various values of @xmath1 for @xmath65 correlators in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the discretisation errors in @xmath24 can be reduced using either standard or improved lattice derivatives , however , the latter requires a smaller value of @xmath1 .",
    "as expected @xmath35 is constant over the time range used in our fit , with the plateau being one timeslice longer in the case of improved derivatives .",
    "our improvement condition is defined in the chiral limit and the results for @xmath1 must be extrapolated to zero quark mass .",
    "details of this procedure are given in appendix  [ secchiralca ] and the results are presented in figure  [ figc ] and in table  [ chiralttwo ] . in general , @xmath1 from using standard derivatives has a bigger statistical error than that obtained using improved derivatives since @xmath45 is larger and the chiral extrapolation is usually more severe .",
    "the latter point is illustrated in figure  [ figd ] . from the discussion above",
    ", the large value of @xmath1 from standard derivatives is due to a large contribution to @xmath35 from the @xmath12 errors associated with these derivatives .",
    "these errors are @xmath53 dependent and should disappear in the chiral limit .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath1 drops significantly with quark mass , agreeing with the result from the improved derivatives in the chiral limit .",
    "in contrast @xmath1 from improved derivatives is much less dependent on the quark mass .",
    "comparing all results in figure  [ figc ] we find @xmath89 from different derivatives , smearing and from different @xmath45 and @xmath46 are consistent in the chiral limit  ( with the exception of @xmath80 for @xmath66 correlators ) .",
    "we also implemented the lanl lattice derivatives  @xcite and found consistent results in the chiral limit .",
    "@xmath90 from @xmath65 correlators , fitting @xmath91 , using improved derivatives is taken as the final value for @xmath1 at this @xmath2 .",
    "the error reflects the spread in values for @xmath1 and indicates the uncertainty from some of the associated @xmath0 effects .",
    "we now consider applying the @xmath92 method at different @xmath2s . in principle",
    ", one should ensure , as accurately as possible , that the same improvement conditions are applied to determine @xmath1 as @xmath2 is changed .",
    "this ensures the systematic errors are correlated between different determinations and @xmath1 smoothly extrapolates to zero in the continuum limit .",
    "for example , we need to keep the proportion of the excited states to ground state contributing to @xmath93 fixed .",
    "this requires a tuning of the smearing function   changes . ] , which was not possible in this study  ( and was not attempted in reference  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we have chosen a fairly conservative error for @xmath1 to take into account the difficulty in applying the same improvement conditions for the other simulations . in principle",
    "any value of @xmath1 in figure  [ figc ] is a valid estimate of the coefficient for a particular simulation . a more aggressive choice for @xmath1 would be , for example @xmath94 from @xmath66 correlators with @xmath95 . in the following , to keep the systematic errors as correlated as possible we extract final numbers for @xmath1 from @xmath65 correlators and improved lattice derivatives  ( as used for our choice of @xmath1 above ) .",
    "in addition , the physical volume of the simulation should also be kept fixed when determining @xmath1 .",
    "we comment on this in the next section .      considering the analysis at @xmath4 first , we present the results for @xmath1 in figure  [ fig2 ] and table  [ chiraltthree ] .",
    "in addition to the simulations on the @xmath97 volume with @xmath66 and @xmath65 correlators , @xmath1 was also calculated on a small ensemble of large volume  ( @xmath98 ) configurations with @xmath99 smearing  ( unfortunately no @xmath65 correlators were available ) . as discussed in appendix  [ multifits ] , the fuzzed smearing was optimised for the ground state and hence the first excited state amplitude for the @xmath66 correlators is very small ; an estimate for @xmath1 could only be extracted for one value of @xmath45 .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath66 and @xmath65 results are consistent and there is no significant variation with @xmath46 .",
    "a discrepancy was found , however , when comparing to the @xmath99 results on the larger volume .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig2 ] for @xmath1 at finite @xmath53 around the strange quark mass .",
    "there is a @xmath100 disagreement between the @xmath66 value for @xmath101 and the @xmath99 value at @xmath95  ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the results could be due to @xmath0 terms arising from the use of different smearings or it may indicate a finite volume effect .",
    "the @xmath97 lattice corresponds to a physical volume of approximately @xmath103 , which is probably too small to accommodate excited pseudoscalar states .",
    "@xmath1 itself is an ultra - violet quantity but may be affected by finite volume effects because of the matrix elements being used to determine it .",
    "we attempted to investigate finite volume effects by comparing masses and decay constants  ( the matrix element @xmath104 , in @xmath79 , is related to @xmath105 ) on the two volumes .",
    "unfortunately , we were only able to extract these quantities for the ground state on the large volume .",
    "we found an @xmath106 or @xmath107 decrease in @xmath108 changing from the small to large volume and no significant change in @xmath105  ( this is in agreement with the results in reference  @xcite ) .",
    "a more thorough investigation of finite volume effects is needed .",
    "if the physical volume was the same as at @xmath63 , it would not matter how dependent @xmath1 is on the size of the lattice , since it is a higher order effect .",
    "however , the finer lattice is @xmath109 smaller than that at @xmath63 .",
    "this must be considered when quoting an error on @xmath1 .    the chiral extrapolations of at @xmath4 proved difficult for @xmath1 from the @xmath65 and @xmath66 correlators .",
    "apart from the @xmath65 result for @xmath110 , the errors on the extrapolated values are very large due to having to use a fit function quadratic in @xmath111 and/or only being able to fit to the lightest data points .",
    "the discrepancy of the @xmath112 result with the @xmath113 @xmath99 value is approximately @xmath107 .    as noted in the previous section , to keep the same improvement conditions @xmath1",
    "should be extracted using a @xmath45 with the same relative proportion of ground state to excited states as that used at @xmath63 .",
    "one possibility , concentrating on @xmath65 correlators , is to fix @xmath45 to correspond to the same physical time ; @xmath101 chosen at @xmath63 corresponds to approximately timeslice @xmath77 for @xmath4 .",

    "if we choose @xmath101 then the errors do not reflect the unresolved @xmath0 or finite volume effects mentioned above .",
    "these problems motivate us to discard the results for @xmath1 at this @xmath2 .    at @xmath96",
    "the situation is more straightforward as displayed in figure  [ fig2b ] and table  [ chiraltfour ]",
    ". there is consistency between the results from different smearings , where the fuzzed smearing is optimised in a similar way to that at @xmath4 , and also as @xmath45 is varied .",
    "we also found no change in the results if @xmath46 is increased and there was no difficulty with chiral extrapolation . keeping the same physical @xmath45 as at @xmath63 corresponds to using timeslice @xmath114 .",
    "unfortunately , the estimates of @xmath1 have fallen into noise at this point .",
    "however , given the stability of the results with @xmath45 we are unlikely to introduce significant systematic errors if we choose a fitting range of @xmath115 .",
    "thus , our final result at this @xmath2 is @xmath116 .",
    "the lattice volumes at @xmath63 and @xmath8 are fairly close in physical size , and we assume that the error on @xmath1 is sufficient to compensate for the small discrepancy .",

    "unfortunately , our errors on @xmath1 are quite large after chiral extrapolation . nevertheless , we obtained consistency with the lanl results , in particular at coarser lattice spacings .",
    "the lanl results are split up into those extracted using standard @xmath12 derivatives and those obtained using modified @xmath117 derivatives , mentioned in section  [ capcac ] .",
    "the latter is closer to the choice of derivatives employed here and we find greater consistency with our results , at @xmath96 , in this case .",
    "the lanl results have smaller errors compared to our values even though our study has much higher statistics .",
    "we believe this is due in part to our more conservative error estimates to take into account the difficulty in applying the improvement conditions consistently as @xmath2 changes .",
    "in addition , the lanl group employed much heavier light quark masses , over a wider range , than in our analysis , and this led to lower statistical errors after chiral extrapolation .",
    "the results from the lanl method are very slowly varying with @xmath2 and do not change significantly from @xmath118 to @xmath8 .",
    "this is in agreement with the 1-loop perturbative results , also shown in the figure for @xmath9  @xcite , where @xmath119  @xcite .",

    "this discrepancy indicates how large the @xmath0 ambiguity in @xmath1 can be .",
    "in addition , the lanl group using new results at @xmath125 have found that the difference between their results and that of the alpha collaboration requires @xmath12 terms as well as @xmath0  @xcite .",
