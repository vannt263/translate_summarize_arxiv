    "recent _ hst _ and ground - based optical observations provided strong evidence that many nearby galaxies harbor supermassive black holes ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ) , possibly accreting at sub - eddington luminosities ( fabian & rees 1995 ) . about 40% of nearby early - type galaxies exhibit signs of mild nuclear activity , in the form of weak non - thermal radio cores ( sadler et al .",
    "1989 ) and low ionization emission lines ( liners ; heckman 1986 ; ho , fillippenko , & sargent 1997a ) .",
    "these results collectively suggest that many nearby galaxies may harbor weak nuclear activity in the form of a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ; e.g. , ho 1999a ) .",
    "thanks to their high penetrating power , x - rays provide an optimal window to search for weak nuclear activity . indeed , previous x - ray   images of a handful of galaxies show the presence of a central unresolved nucleus within the 5   hri resolution ( e.g. , fabbiano 1996 ) .",
    "indirect clues are provided by   spectral constraints : a heavily absorbed power law component is often measured at energies @xmath6 kev , with intrinsic luminosities l@xmath7  , photon indices @xmath8 , and a narrow fe emission line at 67 kev in a few cases , suggestive of a llagn ( makishima et al .",
    "1994 ; ptak et al .",
    "1999 ; sambruna , eracleous , & mushotzky 1999 ; terashima et al . 1999 ) . within the coarse angular resolution of these detectors ,",
    "alternative scenarios can not be ruled out in many cases ( e.g. , a starburst or x - ray binaries ) .",
    "unambiguous evidence for nuclear activity would be provided by the detection of a point source at the galaxy center . with its unprecedented angular resolution ( 0.5 ) ,",
    "wide - band coverage ( 0.210 kev ) , and high sensitivity ,   is uniquely suited to this task .    in this letter",
    ", using recent  calibration observations we discover a llagn in the liner harbored by the nearby cd galaxy hydra  a ( @xmath0=0.0537 ) .",
    "host of the powerful fr  i radio source 3c  218 , hydra  a is the dominant member of the poor cluster of galaxies a780 , and famous for its twin - jet radio morphology ( taylor et al .",
    "the nuclear region contains a @xmath9 6  emission - line nebula ( baum et al . 1989 ; heckman et al . 1989 ) and a disk of star formation ( mcnamara 1995 ; melnick , gopal - krishna , & terlevich 1997 ) . at the position of the nucleus ,",
    "a liner - like optical and uv spectrum is observed ( hansen , jrgensen , & nrgaard - nielsen 1995 ) , which , together with the powerful lobe radio emission , led to the classification of hydra  a as a weak line radio galaxy ( tadhunter et al .",
    "the x - ray emission from hydra  a in previous _ einstein _ , , and   images is dominated by the cluster and the inner ( @xmath10 1.5 ) cooling flow , with @xmath11   ( david et al . 1990 ; ikebe et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in the following ,",
    "we assume a friedman cosmology with @xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 and @xmath14 . at the luminosity distance of hydra",
    "a ( 217.46 mpc ) , 1=0.95 kpc .",
    "hydra  a was observed with   acis - s for 20 ks on 1999 november 11 at the aimpoint of s3 in faint telemetry mode with 5 ccds turned on .",
    "the data were analyzed using the ` eventbrowser ` tool at penn state , and the ` ciao ` software provided by the  x - ray center .",
    "only events for   grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 were accepted .",
    "the s3 background was rather stable during the observation .",
    "spectral analysis was performed within ` xspec ` v.10.0 using response files appropriate for the s3 aimpoint and for the epoch of the present observation ( ` ccd7_c0.7.15.32.rmf ` , ` s3_c1_middle.arf ` ) .",
    "the spectra were rebinned over the energy range 0.26 kev to have a minimum of 20 counts in each bin , to validate the use of the @xmath15 statistics . with a total count rate of @xmath9 0.02 c / s ,",
    "pileup is not a concern . at this time of writing , there appears to be an uncertainty of the order of 10% in the total effective area of the telescope mirror in the 12 kev energy range .",
    "fortunately , for the present analysis the energy range of interest for the nuclear properties is restricted to energies above 2 kev , where the agn component dominates .",
    "the errors in the on - axis effective area above 2 kev are of the order of 5% ( jerius et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "hydra  a was also observed with acis - i for 20 ks in 1999 october 30 , after the ccds suffered radiation damage resulting in a degradation of the gain and spectral resolution . to improve the signal - to - noise ratio we extracted the acis - i spectrum of the nucleus in a region of similar size as for the acis - s data , and analyzed the data using a position - dependent spectral response including an empirical cti correction .",
    "the 26 kev acis - i spectrum of the nucleus was fitted simultaneously to the acis - s data leaving the intercalibration factors free to vary , giving a ratio of the two normalizations of @xmath16 .",
    "figure 1 shows the s3 image of the central regions of hydra  a in 0.210 kev , with the vla radio contours overlayed ( taylor et al . 1990 ) .",
    "the acis - s data were adaptively smoothed using a gaussian function with a kernel of 3.5  , and shifted by 3.6  to align the x - ray and radio core and the other x - ray / radio morphology to better than 0.5 .",
    "this shift is well within the range of uncertainties on the astrometry ( 0.5 5 ) measured in several other acis observations during the orbital activation and check - out phases .",
    "x - ray emission from the compact radio core is readily apparent , embedded in diffuse soft x - ray emission . in the 0.210 kev band , @xmath9",
    "900 counts are detected within 2.5  from the position of the radio core and the radial profile of the x - ray source is extended . at energies",
    "@xmath1 2 kev , the radial profile is point - like and a total of @xmath9 150 counts are collected in 210 kev within 1.5   ( or 80% of the total encircled energy ) .",
    "the hard x - ray point source is also present in the 20 ks acis - i exposure .",
    "thus , with  we were able to detect a point - like x - ray source for the first time in hydra  a at hard energies , indicating that the core radio emission is due to a hidden agn .",
    "interestingly , no x - ray emission is detected from either the jets or lobes ( fig .",
    "1 ) . on the contrary",
    ", the extended radio structures appear to occupy regions relatively deficient in x - ray photons .",
    "this is opposite to what recently detected with   in the fr  ii radio galaxy 3c  295 ( harris et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the inner 10   region around the nucleus in contour form , in 3.74.3 kev .",
    "the nuclear point source is apparent , together with extended faint emission elongated by @xmath9 3   in a n - w direction .",
    "note the extension in the same direction in the radio contours ( fig .",
    "1 ) . at roughly this distance ,",
    "a spot of enhanced blue emission was observed in previous @xmath17 and @xmath18 band images , identified as the bluest edge of a star forming disk ( mcnamara 1995 ; melnick et al .",
    "a total of @xmath9 260 counts are detected within 2   over the 0.210 kev band for this region .",
    "the study of the starburst and of the large - scale x - ray emission in hydra  a are beyond the scope of this paper , and will not be discussed any further ( see mcnamara et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the nuclear x - ray spectrum was extracted from a circular region with radius 1.5 .",
    "the background was extracted in an annulus centered on the nucleus with inner and outer radii 1   and 1.3 , respectively .",
    "the cluster contribution in an area similar to the nuclear region is small , @xmath9 6% , while the instrumental and cosmic background is negligible , @xmath19 ph s@xmath13 arcsec@xmath20 . the spectrum was fitted with a two - component model , including an absorbed power law at energies @xmath1 2 kev , and a raymond - smith thermal plasma at softer energies .",
    "this model is a very good description of the acis - s data , with @xmath15=17 for 23 degrees of freedom .",
    "the data and residuals are shown in figure 3 .",
    "all spectral components in the fit were absorbed by the galactic column density , n@xmath21 cm@xmath20 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the fitted parameters of the absorbed power law are rest - frame column density n@xmath23   and photon index @xmath24 ( uncertainties are 90% confidence for one parameter of interest , @xmath25=2.7 ) .",
    "this is the spectrum of the hard x - ray point source coincident with the radio core in figure 1 .",
    "the slope is consistent within 1@xmath26 with the average value measured with  for other weak line radio galaxies ( wlrgs ) , @xmath27 and dispersion @xmath28 ( sambruna et al .",
    ". the observed fluxes are f@xmath29 and f@xmath30 .",
    "the intrinsic ( absorption - corrected ) luminosity is l@xmath31 , at the high - end of the distribution for wlrgs and liners .",
    "the data require a thermal component at soft energies , with fitted temperature @xmath32 kev , consistent with the value measured for other radio sources with  and   ( worrall & birkinshaw 1994 ; sambruna et al .",
    "the abundance was fixed to the best - fit value , 0.1 solar",
    ". the observed fluxes are f@xmath33 and f@xmath34 .",
    "a possible origin of the thermal component is the halo of the host galaxy .",
    "indeed , the intrinsic luminosity is l@xmath35 , consistent with the values measured for elliptical galaxies .",
    "alternatively , the thermal component could be due to the cooling flow .",
    "hydra  a is the second powerful radio galaxy observed with , and the second instance where a nuclear x - ray point source is detected .",
    "a luminous agn was also discovered in an acis - s 20 ks image of the fr  ii radio galaxy 3c  295 ( harris et al .",
    "2000 ) , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 . as in hydra",
    "a , the agn in 3c  295 resides in a cooling flow .",
    "these results confirm that optically - weak , narrow - emission line radio sources harbor true agns as their brighter , broad - emission line seyfert - like counterparts .",
    "thanks to , a detailed study of the central engines of these systems becomes possible for the first time .",
    "the large x - ray column density we measure in the nucleus of hydra  a , n@xmath38 , implies an optical extinction @xmath39 , assuming galactic gas - to - dust ratios ( bohlin , savage , & drake 1978 ) .",
    "this means that the optical and uv continuum from the agn are strongly ( factor @xmath40 ) suppressed , accounting for why the agn was not previously detected at these wavelengths .",
    "the weak uv continuum detected in archival iue spectra ( hansen et al .",
    "1995 and our own inspection of an unpublished spectrum ) can not be due to the agn ; most likely candidates are the starburst and/or the cooling flow .",
    "hst _ observations should detect only an extended thermal component to the uv light .",
    "we now turn to the issue of whether the llagn is capable of photoionizing the emission - line nebula identified with the nucleus ( baum et al .",
    "1989 ; heckman et al .",
    "1989 ) . to make this assessment we first evaluate the total reddening to the nuclear emission - line source , @xmath41 .",
    "since the nuclear spectrum resembles that of liners , we assume that the intrinsic balmer decrement is h@xmath42/h@xmath43 ( e.g. , ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997b ) , leading to an estimate of @xmath44 given by hansen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) based on the ly@xmath42/h@xmath45 ratio .",
    "hansen et al .",
    "have probably underestimated the reddening because the ly@xmath42 flux was measured in the large iue aperture which very likely includes a contribution from the circumnuclear starburst region . ] . with this value of the reddening and the h@xmath45 flux measured by hansen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) we obtain the rate of emission of h@xmath45 photons from the nebula as @xmath46  s@xmath13 .",
    "if the h@xmath45 emission is the result of case  b recombination , then atomic physics implies @xmath47 ( osterbrock 1989 ) , where @xmath48 is the ionizing photon rate from the active nucleus .",
    "thus , the observed h@xmath45 flux requires that @xmath49  s@xmath13 , where @xmath50 is the covering fraction of the source by the nebula .",
    "in contrast , the observed ionizing photon rate , assuming that the x - ray power - law spectrum extends all the way through the uv band , is @xmath51  s@xmath13 , which falls short of the required rate by a considerable factor , even if @xmath52 ! in fact , if we model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of hydra a after those observed in liners and other llagn , some of which are radio - loud ( ho 1999b ) , the problem persists .    in order to balance the photon budget of the nebula",
    ", we must either postulate that the ionizing spectrum includes a uv bump or invoke and additional power source .",
    "if we assume there is a uv bump , we can parameterize it following mathews & ferland ( 1987 ) and normalize the sed according to the   x - ray spectrum .",
    "we then find an ionizing photon output rate of @xmath53  s@xmath13 , which is more than enough to power the emission lines . on the other hand , one or more other power sources may contribute to the ionization of the nebula .",
    "x - rays from shocks in the cooling flow are plausible ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "another possibility is mechanical interaction of the emission - line gas with the radio jets , which is particularly relevant since the images of hansen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) show superpositions of radio and emission - line knots .    to get a handle on the nature of the accretion flow",
    ", we compared the x - ray luminosity to the limiting eddington luminosity through a rough estimate of the central black hole mass in hydra  a , @xmath54 .",
    "the apparent @xmath55 magnitude of the host galaxy in hydra  a , @xmath56 ( sandage 1973 ) , and figure 8 of magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) imply @xmath57 , consistent with the values dynamically measured in other giant ellipticals ( e.g. , ford et al .",
    "the eddington luminosity is thus @xmath58 . assuming @xmath59 , the luminosity relative to eddington is @xmath60 .",
    "this places hydra  a in the regime of an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; e.g. , narayan , mahadevan , & quataert 1998 ) , similar to other wlrgs ( sambruna et al .",
    "a powerful diagnostic of the accretion flow structure in hydra  a will be afforded by future higher - sensitivity x - ray observations , such as delivered by _",
    "the epic spectrum will allow us to study in more detail the nuclear x - ray properties , in particular whether an fe line is present at 67 kev .",
    "the line energy and profile could allow us to discriminate between a standard seyfert - like disk and an adaf ( e.g. , sambruna & eracleous 1999 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the nuclear x - ray absorption in hydra  a is much larger ( factor 10 ) than the optical / uv extinction to the emission - line nebula ( see above ) , and consistent with the column measured in the radio toward the core ( taylor 1996 ) .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray absorber lies further in than the emission - line regions , close to the central black hole .",
    "a possible candidate is the molecular torus on parsec scales postulated by unification models ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "indeed , the radio and optical observations indicate an edge - on geometry for hydra  a ( taylor et al . 1990 ; baum et al . 1989 ) , such that the torus intercepts the line of sight to the nucleus .",
    "our results thus support current unification models for radio - loud sources and in particular the presence of an obscuring torus in fr  i radio galaxies .",
