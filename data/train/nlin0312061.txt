    "first , one may find relations between different non - integrable models , hoping that for certain questions a problem will be more tractable than another .",
    "second , one considers , instead of exact quantities , the calculation of their smoothed values . in many cases such coarse",
    "graining appears naturally in experimental settings and , usually , it is more easy to treat . third , one tries to understand statistical properties of quantum quantities by organizing them in suitable ensembles .",
    "an advantage of such approach is that many different models may statistically be indistinguishable which leads to the notion of statistical universality .",
    "the ideas and methods of quantum chaos are not restricted only to quantum models .",
    "they can equally well be applied to any problem whose analytical solution either is not possible or is very complicated .",
    "one of the most spectacular examples of such interrelations is the application of quantum chaos to number theory , in particular , to the zeros of the riemann zeta function .",
    "though a hypothetical quantum - like system whose eigenvalues coincide with the imaginary part of riemann zeta function zeros is not ( yet ! ) found , the riemann zeta function is , in many aspects , similar to dynamical zeta functions and the investigation of such relations already mutually enriched both quantum chaos and number theory ( see e.g. the calculation by keating and snaith moments of the riemann zeta function using the random matrix theory @xcite ) .",
    "the topics of these lectures were chosen specially to emphasize the interplay between physics and mathematics which is typical for quantum chaos .    in chap .",
    "[ trace ] different types of trace formulas are discussed .",
    "the main attention is given to the derivation of the selberg trace formula which relates the spectral density of automorphic laplacian on hyperbolic surfaces generated by discrete groups with classical periodic orbits for the free motion on these surfaces .",
    "this question is rarely discussed in the physical literature but is of general interest because it is the only case where the trace formula is exact and not only a leading semiclassical contribution as for general dynamical systems .",
    "short derivations of trace formulas for dynamical systems and for the riemann zeta function zeros are also presented in this chapter .    according to the well - known conjecture @xcite statistical properties of eigenvalues of energies of quantum chaotic systems",

    "different types of trace formula are the cornerstone of quantum chaos .",
    "trace formulas relate quantum properties of a system with its classical counterparts . in the simplest and widely used case",
    "the trace formula expresses the quantum density of states through a sum over periodic orbits and each term in this sum can be calculated from pure classical mechanics .    in general ,",
    "dynamical trace formulas represent only the leading term of the semiclassical expansion in powers of @xmath1 .",

    "the exact green function has to obey @xmath93 and the periodic boundary conditions @xmath94 for all integer @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the fact important for us later is that the rectangular billiard with periodic boundary conditions can be considered as the result of the factorization of the whole plane @xmath97 with respect to the group of integer translations @xmath98 with integer @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the factorization of the plan @xmath97 with respect to these transformations means two things .",
    "first , any two points connected by a group transformation is considered as one point . hence ( [ greenperiodic ] ) fulfilled .",
    "second , inside the rectangle there is no points which are connected by these transformations . in mathematical language",
    "the rectangle with sizes @xmath99 is the fundamental domain of the group ( [ translations ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , the exact green function for the rectangular billiard with periodic boundary conditions equals the sum of the free green function over all elements of the group of integer translations ( [ translations ] ) @xmath100 here @xmath101 is the green function corresponding to the free motion without periodic boundary conditions . to prove formally that it is",
    "really the exact green function one has to note that ( i ) it obeys ( [ greenequation ] ) because each term in the sum obeys it , ( ii ) it obeys boundary conditions ( [ greenperiodic ] ) by construction ( provided the sum converges ) , and ( iii ) inside the initial rectangle only identity term can produce a @xmath16-function contribution required in ( [ greenequation ] ) because all other terms will give @xmath16-functions outside the rectangle .",
    "the next steps are straightforward .",
    "the free green function for the two - dimensional euclidean plane has the form ( [ gfree ] ) . from ( [ imgreen ] )",
    "it follows that the eigenvalue density for the rectangular billiard is @xmath102 which coincides exactly with ( [ smooth ] ) and ( [ osc ] ) obtained directly from the knowledge of the eigenvalues .",
    "the principal drawback of all trace formulas is that the sum over periodic orbits does not converge .",
    "even the sum of the squares diverges .",
    "the simplest way to treat this problem is to multiply both sides of ( [ tracerectangle ] ) by a suitable test function @xmath103 and integrate them over @xmath104 . in this manner one",
    "obtains @xmath105 when the fourier harmonics of @xmath103 decrease quickly the sum over periodic orbits converges and this expression constitutes a mathematically well defined trace formula .",
    "nevertheless for approximate calculations of eigenvalues of energies one can still use ` naive ' trace formulas by introducing a cut - off on periodic orbit sum .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ example ] the result of numerical application of the above trace formula is presented .    in performing this calculation",
    "one uses the asymptotic form of the oscillating part of the density of state ( [ asymptotic ] ) with only 250 first periodic orbits .",
    "though additional oscillations are clearly seen , one can read off this figure the positions of first energy levels for the problem considered . in the literature",
    "many different methods of resummation of trace formulas were discussed ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .      the crucial point in the second method of derivation of the trace formula for the rectangular billiard with periodic boundary conditions was a representation of the exact green function as a sum of a free green function over all images of the initial point .",

    "for any models generated by discrete groups the summation over all periodic orbits is asymptotically equals the integration with the following measure @xmath938 taking into account that when @xmath939 the term with @xmath292 dominates and ( see ( [ apn ] ) ) @xmath940 one obtains that in the diagonal approximation @xmath941 it means that the correlation form factor @xmath942 for arithmetic systems grows much faster than was usually assumed and that for time of order of the ehrenfest time it becomes of the order of 1 .",

    "hecke triangles one gets similar pictures .",
    "it is clearly seen that numerics agrees very well with the predictions of the gaussian orthogonal ensembles of random matrices as it should be for generic chaotic models .",
    "but what are the multiplicities of periodic orbit lengths for non - arithmetic hecke triangles ? as these model are not - arithmetic , one would expect that their length multiplicities should be equal to two as for generic time - reversal invariant systems .",
    "nevertheless numerical calculations ( see @xcite for details ) demonstrated that this is not always the case .    at fig .",
    "[ pl ] we present the numerically computed mean length multiplicities for the hecke triangles with @xmath1136 for lengths @xmath1137 .",
    "white lines indicate a two - parameter fit to these data in the form @xmath1138 @xmath1139 these expressions fit numerical data in the given interval of lengths quite well and indicate that for , at least , certain hecke triangles mean length multiplicity increases exponentially . we stress that ( [ fits ] ) are only the best least - square numerical fits and no attempts were made to determine the accuracy of coefficients .",
    "the discussion of the origin of such unexpected multiplicities for non - arithmetic triangles is beyond the scope of these lectures ( on this subject see @xcite ) .",
    "however it is of interest to understand why exponentially large multiplicities of periodic orbit lengths do not contradict the observed goe behaviour of spectral statistics ( cf .",
    "[ hecke5 ] ) .",
    "let us repeat the arguments of sect .",
    "[ criterion ] for this case with exact degeneracicies . in sect .",
    "[ criterion ] it was demonstrated that periodic orbits with different lengths can be treated in the diagonal approximation if @xmath1142 where @xmath62 is the momentum and @xmath554 is the width of the energy average inherent in the definition of correlation functions of dynamical systems .    as the density of orbits with _",
    "different _ lengths is @xmath1143 it follows that the inequality ( [ lp1lp2 ] ) is valid till maximal length @xmath1144 notice that due to assumed large multiplicity @xmath1145 is different from ( [ lmax ] ) .    from ( [ diagk ] )",
    "it follows that the two - point correlation form factor in the diagonal approximation up to numerical factor is @xmath1146 where @xmath1147 and @xmath1148 . combining all terms together",
    "one obtains that during the maximal time of applicability of the diagonal approximation @xmath1149 with @xmath1150 from ( [ maxl ] ) the form factor increases till @xmath1151 hence , if @xmath1152 as for arithmetic systems the two - point correlation form factor during the time of validity of the diagonal approximation increases till a constant value of the order of 1 .",
    "but if @xmath1153 the form factor for the time of validity can reach only a value of the order of @xmath1154 with @xmath1155 .",
    "as @xmath35 this value tends to zero and no apparent contradiction with standard random matrix ensembles can be derived within the diagonal approximation .",
    "arithmetic groups are a special sub - class of discrete groups characterized by the existence of a representation by matrices with integer elements .",
    "a readable mathematical review of such groups is given in @xcite .",
    "there are two types of arithmetic groups .",
    "the first includes groups commensurable with the modular group and having non - compact fundamental domains with infinite cusps .",
    "the second type of compact arithmetic groups combines groups commensurable with groups derived from quaternion algebras with division .",
    "these groups have finite fundamental domains .    from classical viewpoint the free motion on surfaces generated by arithmetic groupes",
    "is as chaotic as for any hyperbolic surfaces .",
    "but quantum mechanics on these arithmetic surfaces is very special . in particular",
    ", spectral statistics of the laplace  beltrami operator automorphic with respect to arithmetic group is described by the poisson statistics typical for integrable systems and not by the random matrix statistics typical for chaotic models .",
    "the origin of this peculiarity can be traced to the existence in arithmetic systems of a very large number of periodic orbits with exactly the same length .",
    "for all arithmetic groups the mean multiplicity of periodic orbits with length @xmath744 behaves like @xmath1156 .",
    "this has to be compared with the total density of periodic orbits which for all discrete groups is @xmath1157 .",

    "the two - point correlation form factor @xmath942 for arithmetic systems at small @xmath542 increases exponentially like @xmath1158 and during the ehrenfest time ( which is the limit of applicability of the diagonal approximation ) reaches a constant value .",
    "more detailed information can be obtained for the modular group where it is possible to compute the two - point correlation form factor analytically .",
