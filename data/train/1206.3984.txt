    "( [ eq : lin_rad_damping ] ) has been obtained under the assumption  ( [ eq : slowpart ] ) , thus it is expected to be valid only when the particle does not move too fast with respect to the phonons .",
    "this can be quantified by considering a small value for the ratio @xmath209 between the maximum velocity of the impurity distribution when it expands , @xmath210 ( here @xmath211 is the harmonic oscillator length ) , and the velocity of sound @xmath103 .",
    "such ratio is independent of the trap frequency , and is fixed only by the initial squeezing through the uncertainty principle  if the uncertainty in position is @xmath55 then the uncertainty in velocity is @xmath212 .    in our simulations",
    "this parameter is actually not so small .",
    "an estimate can be given as follows : the velocity of sound @xmath99 is a fraction of the fermi velocity for a gas of free fermions at the same density , say @xmath213 , the initial squeezing is @xmath214 and the density @xmath215 , so @xmath216",
    "so we expect corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin_rad_damping ] ) due to retardation effects embodied in eq .  ( [ eq : rad_damping_first ] ) .",
    "in this section we derive the function used to fit the tdmrg data [ see eq .",
    "( 3 ) in the main text ] .",
    "we show how it can be obtained starting both from the quantum langevin equation for an _ ohmic _ bath  @xcite : @xmath217 with noise correlator @xmath218 \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and from the langevin equation  ( [ eq : lin_rad_damping ] ) in the previous section , with a noise correlator given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : noise_corr ] ) that describes a _ superohmic _ bath  @xcite .",
    "the predictions for the oscillation frequency and the damping coefficient are different in the two cases .",
    "however it is possible to treat both equations in the same way , because their respective green functions @xmath219 have a similar pole structure in the frequency domain .",
    "both have two poles at complex frequencies @xmath220 with negative imaginary part ( @xmath221 ) : @xmath222 these are the physically relevant ones and correspond to exponentially decaying solutions .",
    "it is essential for our purposes that @xmath223 .",
    "we point out that eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin_rad_damping ] ) is of third order and its green function has a third pole in the upper half of the complex plane that corresponds to an unphysical diverging solution , also called `` run - away '' solution  @xcite , which will be discarded in the following .",
    "note that , while for the ohmic case @xmath53 is equal to the trap frequency @xmath71 , and @xmath54 is exactly the coefficient that appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : langevin_ohmic ] ) , for the langevin equation in  ( [ eq : lin_rad_damping ] ) one has a more complex dependence on the trap frequency @xmath71 and on the time scale @xmath83 . in the specific , the three roots of the _ cubic _ characteristic equation @xmath224 read @xmath225\\,,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath226 note that @xmath220 have always negative imaginary part , while @xmath227 has positive imaginary part and zero real part .",
    "using eq .  , and the fact that @xmath231 , we can evaluate some asymptotic averages which turn out to be useful to calculate the impurity breathing mode .",
    "some of them are null : @xmath232 while other ones , such as @xmath233 and @xmath234 , can be implicitly written in terms of the spectral function  @xcite , whose form depends on the nature of the bath . finally , call @xmath235 and note that",
    "@xmath236    with all these results at hand , the average of @xmath237 can be calculated at an arbitrary time @xmath3 .",
    "suppose that the particle starts its motion at @xmath238 in a squeezed harmonic potential .",
    "at @xmath239 it will have equilibrated with the bath , and expectation values are taken on the equilibrium state of the _ whole _",
    "system , with the particle at rest in the squeezed harmonic potential .",
    "then the frequency of the harmonic confinement is suddenly quenched to a new value @xmath71 .",
    "the width of the impurity density distribution as a function of time , for @xmath240 , can be explicitly calculated by taking the square of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sol ] ) on the global state : @xmath241 . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : avgzero1])- , one ends up with the following expression : @xmath242 \\,,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath243 .",
    "it is not necessary to calculate explicitly the average @xmath244 , since it has to cancel exactly the other terms in eq .   when @xmath245 and @xmath246",
    ". therefore the final result is @xmath247 \\bigg\\ } \\",
    ", , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the definitions below have been used : @xmath248    we employ eq .   in our fitting procedure as follows .",
    "@xmath249 and @xmath250 are fixed to their non - interacting values @xmath251 while @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 are used as fitting parameters .",
    "the initial width @xmath55 is provided directly by the numerical data .",
    "this choice allows reliable fits that smoothly interpolate with the exact non - interacting result : @xmath252    surprisingly , the same functional form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion2 ] ) holds for two quite different models .",
    "this is due to the form of the two relevant complex frequencies [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : roots ] ) ] that applies to both of them",
    ". however the two models provide distinct predictions for the modulus @xmath253 and the damping coefficient @xmath54 , with some appreciable differences . for an ohmic bath one",
    "has @xmath254 , so that the frequency is not renormalized in this case .",
    "moreover @xmath54 is a fixed time constant independent of the trap frequency .",
    "for the superohmic case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin_rad_damping ] ) , for @xmath255 it can be shown that @xmath256 is a function of @xmath257 , the same holds for @xmath258 ( see fig .  [ varpi - gamma ] ) . notice also that @xmath220 always has a non - zero real part , therefore there is no overdamped solution for any value of @xmath83 .",
    "finally we emphasize that the functional form given in eq .",
    "is essential to extract the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath52 from the numerical data .",
    "indeed we have verified that the numerical fits performed using the functional form  @xcite @xmath259 with @xmath260 being the oscillation amplitude ( grey lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : two_bis ] ) , are significantly different from the ones that are obtained employing eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion2 ] ) ( black lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : two_bis ] ) .",
    "for example , the fit done with eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) often overestimates the asymptotic with @xmath52 .",
