    "his proof is relatively long .",
    "bondy and hemminger @xcite have proposed another proof for this fact by employing counting theorem . here , a new proof is given for trees to be reconstructible .    [ ] trees are reconstructible .",
    "@xcite    _ proof _ : let @xmath108 be a tree and @xmath133 be the induced subgraph on the vertices which are not tree leaves .",
    "we show @xmath3 is an anchor or a connective anchor which is distinguishable .",
    "if @xmath3 is a unique subgraph , then it is an anchor .",
    "otherwise , @xmath3 is unique due to its connection , because the number of edges between @xmath3 and @xmath134 is maximum possible value .",
    "if @xmath108 has @xmath70 leaves , in any card that a leaf is deleted from , we have @xmath135 or @xmath70 leaves . if there are @xmath135 leaves , @xmath3 can be obtained by deletion of @xmath135 leaves and if there are @xmath70 leaves , deletion of any subset of @xmath135 leaves that results in a subgraph isomorphic to @xmath3 gives @xmath3 . because , if deletion of two leaves of a tree results in two isomorphic subgraph , then those two leaves are similar . therefore , @xmath3 is distinguishable in any card containing it . + any tree has at least two leaves .",
    "thus , @xmath134 has at least two vertices .",
    "if @xmath136 has two vertices or is an orbit with at least three vertices , then @xmath108 is reconstructible , respectively , due to corollary [ tree2 ] and theorem [ thm : twob ] . otherwise , we enlarge the anchor until we reach to two vertices out of the anchor or a maximal anchor with at most @xmath2 vertices . if we reach to a maximal anchor , the shadow graph established on the anchor is balanced due to lemma [ maximal ] .",
    "if only one vertex remains in @xmath137 , we come back one step , and have a quasi - balanced shadow graph .",
    "+ we show this balanced or quasi - balanced shadow graph is reconstructible and , consequently , @xmath108 is reconstructible .",
    "if the vertices of the shadow graph belong to two or more classes of isomorphism , then the induced sub shadow graph on one class make an anchor .",
    "thus , all vertices of the shadow graph are isomorphic .",
    "let @xmath138 be the center of @xmath3 .",
    "we assign to each vertex @xmath139 , the number of vertices in @xmath140 which their path to @xmath138 pass through the vertex @xmath15 . in any depth , all non - zero values should be the same ( or at most there is just one vertex with value of 1 and other are the same when shadow graph is quasi - balanced ) . because otherwise , vertices with maximum values enables us to have an anchor .",
    "therefor , we can find the location of a vertex of shadow graph from disequilibrium of the assigned values in a card that a vertex of shadow graph is omitted from .",
    "in fact , in this case the shadow graph is vertex transitive or there is a vertex which its deletion reveals a vertex transitive shadow graph.@xmath45",
    "we saw that any graph which is not vertex - transitive has either an anchor or a connective anchor .",
    "we extend the anchor ( or distinguishable connective anchor ) as far as we reach an orbit with at least three vertices or two vertices out of the anchor .",
    "then , we use the following result to show that the graph is reconstructible .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph which is not vertex - transitive with @xmath1 vertices .",
    "if @xmath0 has an orbit @xmath4 with at least three vertices such that @xmath84 is an anchor ( connective anchor ) or has an anchor ( connective anchor ) with ( @xmath2 ) vertices such that it satisfies in the condition of theorem [ fix ] or lemma [ z2 ] or lemma [ distance_anchor ] , then @xmath0 is reconstructible .",
    "the above statement , in spite of being simple , is sufficient to show that considerable families of graphs are reconstructible from their deck .",
    "for instance , using the above statement , we have shown that trees and small graphs are reconstructible . until now , we have not found any graph that does not satisfy in the condition of the above statement .",
