    "a very crucial tool in the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations is a comparison with solutions to linear problems .",
    "this powerful idea firstly appears in the work of de giorgi @xcite in the context of minimal surfaces . roughly speaking we consider the nonlinear problem locally as a perturbation of a linear partial differential equation and try to transfer qualitative properties from the linear theory .",
    "solutions to linear problems typically are smooth so we are hoping to approximate solutions to nonlinear problems by solutions to linear ones in an appropriate way in order to establish regularity properties ( of the solutions to nonlinear equations ) . + let @xmath10 be an elliptic tensor , i.e. @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 open and bounded with lipschitz boundary ( for instance a ball ) .",
    "we call a function @xmath14 with @xmath15 @xmath0-harmonic on @xmath16 . on the other ,",
    "if we have for some @xmath17 @xmath18 i.e. the integral @xmath19 is small ( compared to some norms of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) we call @xmath20 almost @xmath0-harmonic . de giorgi s observation in @xcite was the fact that almost harmonic functions can be approximated by harmonic ones .",
    "precisely , if @xmath22 is almost harmonic it can be approximated with respect to the @xmath23-norm . since this",
    "usually does not suffice to show regularity one needs in addition a caccioppoli inequality .",
    "it bounds the @xmath23-norm of the gradient in terms of the @xmath24-norm of the function itself .",
    "both together - harmonic approximation and caccioppoli - inequality - finally yield local @xmath25-estimates .",
    "+ since the pioneering work of de giorgi a lot of improvement and generalizations have been done ( see @xcite for an overview ) . for instance",
    "the @xmath26-harmonic approximation was introduced in @xcite and gives a nonlinear variant considering the @xmath26-laplace equation @xmath27 here almost solutions in @xmath28 can be approximated by solutions in the @xmath29-sense .",
    "this technique has been improved in @xcite where an approximation in @xmath30 for all @xmath9 is possible .",
    "moreover , it applies also to the more general setting of orlicz spaces .",
    "a crucial tool for the approximation result in @xcite is the lipschitz truncation method ( originally developed in @xcite ; it allows to approximate a sobolev function by a lipschitz continuous function in a way that they are equal on a large set whose size can be controlled ) .",
    "based on the @xmath0-harmonic approximation and its generalizations a lot of ( partial- ) regularity results for nonlinear pde s have been shown . a nice overview about regularity regularity and irregularity for elliptic problems is given in @xcite .",
    "+ let us turn to fluid mechanics .",
    "the @xmath26-stokes problem - describing the slow stationary flow of a non - newtonian fluid @xcite,@xcite - reads as follows : for a given volume force @xmath31 find @xmath32 such that @xmath33 here the nonlinear tensor @xmath34 satisfies the @xmath26-growth condition @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "the problem firstly appears in the mathematical literature in the work of ladyshenskaya and lions ( see @xcite-@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "regularity results are shown in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite and others .",
    "in contrast to classical problems in nonlinear pdes like the @xmath26-laplace equation we have only control over the symmetric part @xmath37 of the gradient and more important we have the side condition @xmath38 . a corresponding approximation theory is developed in @xcite and approximates an almost solutions @xmath39 to the @xmath0-stokes problem by a solution in the @xmath40-sense for all @xmath9 .",
    "let us consider the function spaces @xmath41 where @xmath42 has to be understood in the @xmath43-sense ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a function @xmath44 is a solution to the @xmath2-stokes problem iff @xmath45 it is an almost solution if we have @xmath46 with some @xmath17 .",
    "note that the formulation above is the weakest possible as it only requires @xmath47 .",
    "the approximation result in @xcite is based on the solenoidal lipschitz truncation combined with results developed in @xcite for the @xmath0-harmonic approximation in orlicz spaces .",
    "+ in order to study regularity properties of nonlinear parabolic equations duzaar and mingione @xcite introduce the @xmath0-caloric approximation which compares almost solutions to the @xmath0-heat equation with its solutions .",
    "we call a function @xmath48 with @xmath49 @xmath0-caloric on @xmath4 , where @xmath50 is a bounded interval .",
    "if the left hand side is small we talk about an almost @xmath0-caloric function . in @xcite it is shown that every almost @xmath0-caloric function @xmath51 can be approximated by a @xmath0-caloric function in the parabolic @xmath52-sense .",
    "this is used to establish partial regularity results for nonlinear parabolic systems ( see @xcite for an overview ) . despite the elliptic setting",
    "there is not so much literature available .",
    "+ the aim of the present paper is to develop an approximation theory for non - stationary problems in fluid mechanics in the fashion of the @xmath0-caloric approximation .",
    "let us be a little bit more precise : a function @xmath1 is a solution to the non - stationary @xmath2-stokes problem iff @xmath53 it is an almost solution if we have @xmath54 for all @xmath55 with some @xmath17 .",
    "the main results of this paper ( see theorem [ astokes ] in section 4 ) states that every almost solution @xmath56 to the non - stationary @xmath0-stokes problem can be approximated by a solution in the @xmath8-sense for all @xmath9 .",
    "so , it extend the result from @xcite to non - stationary flows .",
    "again we are able to work with the weakest formulation of almost solutions .",
    "the main tool is the solenoidal lipschitz truncation for parabolic pde s which was recently developed in @xcite .",
    "we present a version of it which is appropriate for our purposes in section 3 .",
    "in addition to the results from @xcite we show an approximation result for the distributional time derivative of the lipschitz truncation ( see thm . [",
    "cor : appl ] d ) ) . in section 2",
    "we present an @xmath57-theory for the non - stationary @xmath0-stokes problem in divergence form .",
    "it might not be surprising for experts but it is hard to find a reference in literature .",
    "+ the investigation of the parabolic @xmath0-stokes approximation is a first step towards a partial regularity theory for nonlinear stokes systems ( results for the nonstationary @xmath26-navier - stokes are shown in @xcite under certain restrictions on @xmath26 ) . however the second step is still missing : an appropriate caccioppoli - type inequality . for the heat equation ( and also for parabolic systems with quadratic growth ) it can be shown that solutions satisfy @xmath58 here @xmath59 is a parabolic cube with radius @xmath60 .",
    "a corresping version for parabolic systems with @xmath26-growth also exsists ( see @xcite ) . due to the appearance of the pressure term it seems to be not possible to show such an estimate for stokes systems - not even in the linear case .",
    "some modifications of ( [ cacc ] ) can be proven , but the known versions do not suffice to show partial regularity .",
    "the aim of this section is to present regularity results for the ( non - stationary ) @xmath0-stokes system depending on the right hand side ( in divergence form ) .",
    "let us fix for this section a bounded domain @xmath61 with @xmath62-boundary and a time interval @xmath63 the @xmath0-stokes problem ( in the pressure - free formulation ) with right hand side @xmath64 reads as : find @xmath65 such that @xmath66 the right hand side can also be given in divergence form , i.e. @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "for certain purposes it is convenient to discuss the problem with a fixed divergence . to be precise for @xmath69 , where @xmath70 we are seeking for a function @xmath71 with @xmath72 satisfying ( [ eq : af ] ) or ( [ eq : af ] ) .",

    "both parts follow from @xcite , thm 4.1 .",
    "however , the main tool in @xcite is the theory from @xcite where very general linear systems are investigated .",
    "hence it is clear that the results also hold in case of an arbitrary elliptic tensor @xmath0 .",
    "now we turn to the parabolic problem and the first result is a local @xmath57-estimate for weak solutions . in case of the @xmath0-heat system this follows from the continuity of the corresponding semigroup ( see @xcite ) .",
