    "compact groups ( hereafter cgs ) have been puzzling astronomers for a number of years . how can a few bright galaxies coexist within less than 100 kpc ?",
    "cgs may have formed early , and have managed to survive the merging instability ( @xcite ; athanassoula , in these proceedings ) or else formed just recently @xcite . alternatively",
    ", cgs may be not be truly dense in 3d , but caused instead by chance alignments of galaxies along the line of sight within larger loose groups @xcite , clusters @xcite and cosmological filaments ( @xcite , hereafter hkw ) .    in this contribution",
    ", we provide new light on this debate by studying the group velocity dispersions , x - ray , optical and continuum radio emission , and by predicting the frequency of dense groups as compact as @xcite s ( @xcite , hereafter hcgs ) appear to be , using the @xcite cosmological formalism .",
    "we conclude on the nature of hcgs .",
    "for near spherical virialized systems , mass increases with some power ( near 3 , as is easily shown by combining the virial theorem with a critical mean density for virialization ) of the velocity dispersion of virialized systems .",
    "one therefore expects that _ there must be a minimum velocity dispersion for a virialized galaxy system to be more massive than the sum of the masses of its member galaxies_. systems near full collapse should have even larger velocity dispersions .    for a tighter constraint , within a given radius @xmath1 , the sum of the masses of the galaxies _ before they they got close to one another _ must be smaller or equal to the mass within the same radius that the group would have _ once it virializes _ : @xmath2 .",
    "assuming @xcite profiles for groups and halos of galaxies , one can show @xcite that the velocity dispersion @xmath3 of a given dense group must satisfy : @xmath4 where the sums are over the deprojected maximum rotation velocities of spirals and the internal velocity dispersions of ellipticals .",
    ".hickson compact group minimum velocity dispersions [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     columns ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) : number of spirals and ellipticals used ; columns ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) : minimum group velocity dispersion ( in @xmath5 ) from spirals and from ellipticals ; column ( 6 ) : global minimum group velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 ) , _",
    "@xmath7 ; column ( 7 ) number of accordant redshift galaxies in group ; column ( 8) measured group velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "although there is still little data on the internal kinematics of hcg galaxies , table 1 above shows that 5 hcgs out of 12 ( hcgs 16 , 40 , 44 , 88 and 89 ) have abnormally low velocity dispersions , and two others ( hcgs 57 and 90 ) have just marginal velocity dispersions .",
    "we expect to measure by chance low velocity dispersions in roughly 20% of dense groups ( those with chance tangential velocity vectors ) .",
    "still , most of the 5 hcgs mentioned above have too low velocity dispersions to be dense systems near virialization .",
    "the simplest alternative is that they are chance alignments within loose groups near turnaround , since at turnaround the velocity dispersion of galaxy systems is expected to be small .",
    "another possibility is that _ tidal friction _ has been effective in slowing down the galaxies , although this is only expected in much more compact groups near full coalescence ( @xcite ; temporin , in these proceedings ) .",
    "the two groups with @xmath8 may simply have little intergalactic matter .",
    "given that the internal kinematics data on hcg galaxies is very incomplete ( only one group has data for all its members , _",
    "@xmath9 ) , some of the groups with high velocity dispersions may turn out to have only marginal velocity dispersions and thus possess little intergalactic matter , while some of the marginal ones may in fact be non - real . in any event , _ there seems to be 3 classes of compact groups , following decreasing velocity dispersion : groups with substantial intergalactic matter , groups will little intergalactic matter and chance alignments within loose groups ( or clusters or cosmological filaments)_.    finally one may be tempted to secure more precise velocity dispersions by including the galaxies from the environment of hcgs with the data of @xcite and @xcite , but these spectroscopic surveys show that the velocity dispersion usually increases with inclusion of the environment galaxies , and it is not clear that one is not increasingly affected by interlopers .",
    "we now focus on hcg  16 , the prime , example of a low velocity dispersion , spiral - rich compact group",
    ".      the x - ray properties of hcg  16 are controversial and possibly extreme . in their rosat / pspc",
    "x - ray survey of hcgs , @xcite ( hereafter pbeb ) , hcg  16 was the coldest detected group ( @xmath10 ) , and there are no other spiral - only compact groups with diffuse x - ray emission ( mulchaey in these proceedings ; see also pbeb ) .",
    "moreover , whereas diffuse x - rays were clearly detected by pbeb , @xcite failed to detect such diffuse emission at an upper limit 16 times lower , , their quoted upper limit for their luminosities were underestimated by a factor 2 for all undetected groups in their table  4 except hcg 3 . ] whereas only a factor 2.3 is attributable to the wider ( `` bolometric '' ) energy range in which pbeb compute their luminosities .",
    "given the low temperature that pbeb derive for hcg  16 , their derived x - ray luminosity places it two orders of magnitude above their compact group luminosity - temperature relation and roughly a factor of two above the extrapolation of the cluster trend .",
    "it thus seems difficult to reconcile hcg  16 with a low temperature extrapolation of regular x - ray emitting compact groups . @xcite",
    "have re - analyzed the rosat / pspc observations of hcg  16 with the hopes of resolving the discrepancy between @xcite and pbeb and establishing if an irregular morphology is caused by clumpiness or fluctuations in signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "figure  [ h16]a below shows the x - ray emission of hcg  16 as contours overlayed on a greyscale map of the group .",
    "the emission beyond the galaxies is indeed significant in a few compact regions : around the galaxies a&b , c and d , as well as a few clumpy regions outside the galaxies denoted c1 ( comprised of 4 sub - clumps ) , c4 and c5 .",
    "figure  [ h16]b shows the 20 cm continuum radio contours , measured with the nvss survey , and illustrates _ the similarity between the x - ray and 20  cm continuum radio morphologies of hcg  16_. a closer look @xcite reveals that c1a is connected with a radio - galaxy , which turns out to have a redshift @xcite that clearly places it in the background , c1b is connected with a radio - source , c1c is related to a foreground star , and c5 is connected to a radio - source and to a background group or cluster .",
    "this reduces the x - ray luminosity of the diffuse hot gas connected with hcg  16 by 50% to @xmath11 . in the regions without significant x - ray emission , the upper limits to the counts correspond to at most 1/4 the the space density of hot gas in the detected regions .",
    "hence , _ the hot gas in hcg  16 is clumpy_.      if hcg  16 is part a cosmological filament viewed nearly end - on ( hkw ) , one should see this filament in its large - scale environment .",
    "we have searched with ned a roughly cubical region around hcg  16 of @xmath12 size .",
    "hcg  16 is close enough ( @xmath13 ) that ned should be fairly complete around it .",
    "the projected environment of hcg  16 within @xmath14 from the group distance ( fig .",
    "[ envmt]a ) suggests concentration of galaxies along 4 projection angles .",
    "figure [ envmt]b shows the wedge diagrams in each of these position angles , and one can guess a filament at @xmath15 , stopping at hcg  16 and a wide sheet visible at @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "_ there are no filaments closely aligned to the line - of - sight _ as would have been favored by hkw .",
    "although loose groups have generally not yet collapsed , one can apply the @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter , ps ) formalism to these systems , assuming that when they will collapse , their mass is what we infer today ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we then obtain @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the rate of formation of structures derived by @xcite from the ps formalism .",
    "@xmath21-body simulations suggest that compact groups can not survive ( with at least 4 members ) for over @xmath22 ( @xcite ; athanassoula in these proceedings ) , the fraction increasing with mass .",
    "assume therefore that compact groups must have undergone their cosmological collapse within that time .",
    "one then obtains @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the probability that a dense group of mass @xmath25 exists today given that it collapsed with a mass @xmath26 at time @xmath27 ( given by @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ ndglgps ] shows the resulting loose and dense group mass functions , both normalized to the ps cosmic mass function , for a @xmath28cdm cosmology ( scdm and ocdm with reasonable values for @xmath29 yield roughly similar curves ) .",
    "massive dense groups survive longer simply because they have more galaxies , so the figure should be interpreted by adopting the recent collapse ( _ solid curve _ ) for the lower mass end and the earlier collapse for the high mass end .",
    "the ratio of dense to loose groups then varies with increasing group mass from 12 to 20% .",
    "if compact groups are replenished by infalling galaxies @xcite , they collapse even earlier and we would predict even more compact groups today .    in contrast , the estimates of the ratio of hcgs to loose groups range from 0.58% ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "comparison of the hcg sample with a similar compact group sample automatically selected from cosmos / edsgc galaxies ( @xcite ; iovino in these proceedings ) shows that the hcg sample is severely incomplete : inspection of @xcite s fig .",
    "7 suggests that the incompleteness of the hcg sample is a factor of 3 at the bright - end and increasingly worse at fainter magnitudes .",
    "now if dense groups represent only a few percent of the cosmic mass function , where are the remaining virialized cosmic structures with masses near @xmath30 ?",
    "the answer is simple : _ the remaining structures collapsed too early to be visible as compact groups today , and must then be in different stages of the final coalescence of groups_. this includes quartets with massive dominant members ( thus failing @xcite s @xcite magnitude concordance criterion : @xmath31 ) , as well as triplets , and binaries .",
    "but since the cosmic multiplicity function decreases with increasing galaxy number , one is led to conclude that most of the missing structures are fully coalesced , single galaxies , which harbor large x - ray halos , as discovered by @xcite ( @xcite , see mulchaey , in these proceedings ) and @xcite . therefore , we predict that _ x - ray over - luminous ellipticals should be more common than compact groups_.",
    "it is very difficult to decide whether the numerous signatures of galaxy interactions in cgs are proofs of their reality or alternatively simply binary interactions within binary - rich chance alignments of galaxies within the line of sight @xcite .",
    "the high fraction of hcgs with diffuse x - ray emission ( pbeb ) should be reduced when only considers groups with _ regular _ diffuse x - rays (   3.1 ) .",
    "however , the combination of hi ( verdes - montenegro , in these proceedings ) and optical ( mendes de oliveira , in these proceedings ) data on hcgs suggests that most of these are real interacting systems . in view of this beautiful data ,",
    "the arguments spelled out by @xcite against the reality of hcgs must be reappraised .    the large predicted cosmic rate of production of dense groups (  4 above ) implies that the low survival time of dense groups is no longer a good argument against the reality of most compact groups .",
    "moreover , the end products of dense groups  isolated bright elliptical galaxies with huge x - ray halos  are now being seen @xcite .    whereas mergers tend to increase rapidly the difference in first and second ranked magnitudes , the low @xmath32 of hcgs @xcite is simply caused by @xcite s strong bias @xcite against groups with dominant members still satisfying the magnitude concordance criterion .",
    "this bias probably also causes the absence of significant luminosity segregation in comparison with simulated groups @xcite .",
    "the morphology - density relation of hcgs is offset @xcite relative to the cluster / loose group / field morphology - density relation ( measured by @xcite ) : at a given galaxy number density , hcgs have too many spirals .",
    "however , hcgs have too _ few _ spirals given their velocity dispersions in comparison with the cluster morphology - velocity dispersion trend ( pbeb ) .",
    "there happens to be virtually no low velocity dispersion hcgs beyond 10,@xmath33 , therefore the number of hcgs whose low velocity dispersion (  2 ) suggests they are non - real is limited to roughly 10 out of 69 accordant redshift hcgs with at least 4 members .",
    "therefore , _ there are few arguments left against the reality of hcgs_. however , the samples of automatically defined compact groups ( iovino , in these proceedings ) will be much looser on average ( given the same compactness criterion as originally used by @xcite ) , since the hcg sample is severely incomplete for marginally compact groups @xcite , hence one would expect that _ automatically selected compact groups will be more prone to chance alignments _ ( see @xcite ) ."
