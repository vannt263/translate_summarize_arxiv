    "will increase the density of the motional states used for the two - qubit interaction .",
    "consequently , it will become even harder to implement clean two - qubit gates . scaling ion trap quantum computers much further",
    "therefore seems to require some form of distributed quantum information processing , possibly involving ion transport @xcite .",
    "the schemes mentioned above are based on manipulating _",
    "stationary _ qubits such as atoms , molecules , or trapped ions .",
    "an alternative route to finding a feasible and scalable technology for building quantum computers is based on _ flying _ qubits , such as photons .",
    "the main advantage of photons is their extremely long coherence time : in vacuum and in simple dielectric media , photons do not interact with their environment , and hence do not lose their quantum information .",
    "this is why photons are usually the qubits of choice for quantum communication @xcite .",
    "however , at the same time this lack of interaction means that it is very hard to create two - photon entangling gates .",
    "it therefore came as a surprise that the bosonic symmetry requirement of the electromagnetic field , together with photon counting and proper single - photon sources , is sufficient for implementing scalable quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the overhead cost for linear optical quantum computing ( loqc ) has subsequently been brought down significantly . in particular , the one - way or cluster - state model for quantum computing @xcite",
    "has allowed for drastic improvements in the scalability @xcite .",
    "recently , a four - qubit cluster state was realized experimentally by walther _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "the main drawbacks of loqc are the difficulties of maintaining interferometric stability , the lack of practical ` on demand ' single - photon sources and the lack of quantum memories for photonic qubits @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the practical advantage of combining stationary and flying qubits for the realisation of scalable quantum computing .",
    "the stationary qubits ( single photon sources ) are arranged in a network of nodes with each node processing and storing a small number of qubits . to achieve scalability ,",
    "the concept of distributed quantum computing was introduced and it was proposed that distant qubits communicate with each other through the means of flying qubits ( i.e.  photons ) @xcite .",
    "initial schemes for the implementation of this idea relied on entangled ancillas as a resource @xcite .",
    "others required that the photon from one source is fed into another source @xcite or a photon - mediated interaction between two fiber - coupled distant cavities needed to be established @xcite .",
    "more hybrid approaches to quantum computing can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "other authors developed schemes for the probabilistic generation of highly entangled states between distant single photon sources @xcite . in these schemes ,",
    "one generates a photon in each of the sources and then performs an entangling photon measurement . by virtue of entanglement swapping , this results in entangled stationary qubits .",
    "it has been shown that similar ideas can also result in the implementation of probabilistic remote two - qubit gates @xcite . at this point , it was believed that scalable quantum computing with distant photon sources requires additional resources such as local entangling gates @xcite or entangled ancillas in order to become deterministic .    the concrete setup that we consider in this paper has recently been introduced by lim _",
    "_ @xcite and allows for the more efficient implementation of universal two - qubit gates than previous proposals .",
    "the presented scheme consists of a network of single stationary qubits ( like trapped atoms , molecules , ions , quantum dots and nitrogen vacancy color centers ) inside optical cavities , which act as a source for the generation of single photons on demand .",
    "read - out measurements and single qubit rotations can be performed on the stationary qubits using laser pulses and standard quantum optics techniques as employed in the recent ion trap experiments in innsbruck and boulder @xcite .",
    "the main building block for the realization of a two - qubit gate , which qualifies the setup for universal quantum computing , is shown in figure [ moon ] .",
    "it requires the simultaneous generation of a photon in each source involved in the operation .",
    "afterwards the photons should pass through a linear optics setup , where a pair measurement is performed in the output ports .",
    "this photon pair measurement results either in the completion of the gate or indicates the presence of the original qubits . in the later event",
    ", the gate should be repeated .",
    "the qubits are never lost in the computation and the presented scheme has therefore been called _ repeat - until - success _ quantum computing @xcite .    under realistic conditions , i.e.  in the presence of finite detector efficiencies and finite success rates for the generation of a single photon on demand , the setup in figure 1 can still be used for the implementation of probabilistic gates with a very high fidelity . as shown recently by barrett and kok @xcite , it is possible to use probabilistic gates to efficiently generate graph states for one - way quantum computing @xcite . both schemes , @xcite and @xcite overcome the limitations to scalable quantum computing faced before when using the same resources . in ref .",
    "@xcite this is achieved with an eventually deterministic gate .",
    "@xcite introduced a so - called double - heralding scheme , in which the entangling photo - detection stage was employed twice to eliminate unwanted separable contributions to the density matrix .    in this paper , we combine the ideas presented in our previous work @xcite . in this way , we obtain a truly scalable design for quantum computing , i.e.  even in the presence of imperfect components , with several key advantages :    1",
    ".   since our system uses _ no direct qubit - qubit interactions _ , the qubits can be well isolated .",
    "not only does this allow us to address the individual qubits easily , it also means that there are fewer decoherence channels and hence fewer errors in the computation .",
    "we achieve _ robustness to photon loss_. in the presence of photon loss , the two qubit gates become non - deterministic .",
    "however , the gate failures are heralded , and so the gates can still be used to build high - fidelity entangled states , albeit in a non - deterministic manner .",
    "photon loss thus increases the overall overhead cost associated with the scheme , but does not directly reduce the fidelity of the computation .",
    "when realistic photo - detectors and optical elements are used , photon loss is inevitable and this built - in robustness is essential .",
    "our scheme largely relies only on _ components that have been demonstrated in experiments _ like atom - photon entanglement @xcite .",
    "apart from linear optics , we require only relatively good sources for the generation of single photons on demand @xcite , preferrably at a high rate @xcite , and relatively efficient but not necessarily number resolving photon detectors @xcite . combining these in a working quantum computer will be challenging , but the basic physics has been shown to be correct .",
    "4 .   the photon pair measurement is _ interferometrically stable_. since each generated photon contributes equally to the detection of a photon in the linear optics setup , fluctuations in the length between the photon source and the detectors can at most result in an overall phase factor with no physical consequences .",
    "this constitutes a significant advantage compared to previous schemes based on one - photon measurements ( the only interferometrically stable schemes are @xcite ) , since the photons do not need to arrive simultaneously in the detectors as long as they overlap within their coherence time in the setup .",
    "the basic ideas presented in this paper are _ implementation independent _ and the stationary qubits can be realised in a variety of ways . any system with the right energy - level structure and able to produce encoded flying qubits may be used .",
    "our scheme is inherently _",
    "distributed_. hence , it can be used in applications which integrate both quantum computation and quantum communication .",
    "we show that entanglement can be generated directly between any two stationary qubits in the physical quantum computer .",
    "this significantly reduces the computational cost compared to architectures involving only nearest - neighbor interactions between the qubits @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give an overview on the basic principles of measurement - based quantum computing , since the described hybrid approach to quantum computing constitutes a novel implementation of these ideas .",
    "section iii details the general principle of a remote two - qubit gate implementation . in section [ rea",
    "] , we discuss possible gate implementations with polarization and time - bin encoded photons . in section [ cluster ] , we describe how to overcome imperfections of inefficient photon generation and detection with the help of pre - fabricated graph states .",
    "finally , we state our conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
    "one condition for the successful implementation of a measurement - based quantum gate is that the measurement outcome is _ mutually unbiased _",
    "@xcite with respect to the computational basis . in this way",
    ", an observer does not learn anything about the state of the qubits and the information might remain stored inside the computer . to avoid the destruction of qubits",
    ", it is not allowed to measure on the qubits directly .",
    "measurements should only be performed on ancillas , which have interacted and therefore share entanglement with the qubits .",
    "these ancillas can be of the same physical realisation as the computational qubits @xcite but they might also be realised differently . if the stationary qubits are atoms , the ancilla can be the quantised field mode inside an optical cavity @xcite , a common vibrational mode @xcite or newly generated photons , as in the setup considered here .",
    "vice versa , it has been found advantageous to use collective atomic states as ancillas for photonic qubits @xcite .",
    "let us now briefly describe the principles of measurement - based quantum computing in a more formal way . using the terms ` qubits ' and ` ancillas '",
    "provides a convenient picture , which is especially suited for the description of hybrid approaches , where the qubits may remain encoded in the same physical qubits instead of being assigned dynamically as the computation proceeds . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider two systems , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , that are initially in the state ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 after some interaction , the joint system evolves into @xmath5 where the @xmath6 are the eigenstates of an observable @xmath7 .",
    "we can then measure @xmath7 , which will reveal the state of the system @xmath1 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a quantum non - demolition measurement of @xmath1 but this is not what we are interested in here .    in this article",
    "we will instead consider measurements of an observable @xmath8 , as shown in figure [ minkslevel ] , that is complementary to @xmath7 .",
    "in other words , the eigenvectors of @xmath7 and @xmath8 form a so - called mutually unbiased basis of the hilbert space of system @xmath2 . a specific outcome labelled @xmath9 of such a measurement corresponds to the application of the projection operator @xmath10 ( associated with the @xmath11 eigenvector of @xmath8 ) , and the state of system @xmath1",
    "is then given by @xmath12}{\\text{tr}_{sa } \\left [    \\langle\\phi| \\unity \\otimes \\hat{b}_k |\\phi\\rangle \\right ] } \\ , .\\ ] ] this can be generalized to situations where @xmath10 is a multi - rank projector or a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) .",
    "the conditions for the evolution @xmath13 to be a unitary transformation on system @xmath1 are presented in lapaire _",
    "if @xmath1 describes the qubits and @xmath2 the ancilla , they guarantee , as mentioned above , that the detection of @xmath10 does not reveal any information about the qubits .    especially ,",
    "in the setup considered in this paper the system @xmath1 consists of a set of @xmath14 stationary qubits occupying a hilbert space of size @xmath15 , and system @xmath2 consists of @xmath14 flying quantum systems occupying a hilbert space of dimension @xmath16 .",
    "a measurement of the observable @xmath8 on the flying qubits will result in a multi - qubit ( entangling ) operation on the stationary qubits .",
    "we are interested in the case where the projector @xmath10 induces a _ unitary _ transformation on the stationary qubits , @xmath17 which means that @xmath10 is a proper projector .",
    "there are two interesting cases to consider :    1",
    ".   the set @xmath18 corresponds to a basis of states that induces a complete set @xmath19 of entangling quantum gates . as a result ,",
    "finding any measurement outcome @xmath9 will induce a unitary entangling gate operation on the stationary qubits .",
    "the set @xmath18 corresponds to a basis that can be divided into two sets of states : some of the projectors will induce a unitary entangling gate @xmath20 on the stationary qubits , while the remaining projectors induce a transformation that is locally equivalent to the identity map @xmath21 .",
    "[ r]@xmath22 [ r]@xmath23    the second setup is interesting for the following reason : suppose that system @xmath1 consists of @xmath14 non - interacting ( e.g. , well - separated ) stationary qubits with long decoherence times .",
    "if this system can generate flying qubits in the manner described above , we can perform a measurement of the observable @xmath8 and entangle the non - interacting stationary qubits .",
    "when not all measurement outcomes produce an entangling gate on the stationary qubits ( some yield instead the identity operator ) , then the unitary gate is applied only part of the time . however , due to the fact that a gate failure corresponds to an identity operation ( or something locally equivalent ) , we can again prepare the flying qubits in the state @xmath23 .",
    "this allows us to repeat the protocol until the entangling gate is applied successfully , which is why we called this idea repeat - until - success quantum computing @xcite .",
    "one of the requirements for universal quantum computing is the ability to perform an entangling two - qubit gate operation , like a controlled phase gate @xcite . in this section",
    "we describe the general concept for the implementation of this gate between two distant single photon sources .",
    "note that our method of distributed quantum computing allows to realize entangling operations , since the measurement on a photon pair can imprint a phase on the state of its sources although it can not change the distribution of their populations .",
    "the first step for the implementation of a two - qubit gate is the generation of a photon within each respective source , which encodes the information of the stationary qubit .",
    "let us denote the states of the photon sources , which encode the logical qubits @xmath24 and @xmath25 as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "an arbitrary pure state of two stationary qubits can then be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are complex coefficients with @xmath33 leads to the creation of one photon in state @xmath34 , while source 2 prepared in @xmath35 leads to the creation of one photon in state @xmath36 , @xmath37 the simultaneous creation of a photon in both sources then transfers the initial state ( [ original ] ) into @xmath38 note that the generation of photons whose state depends on the states of the stationary qubits is a highly non - linear process .",
    "the preparation of the generally entangled state ( [ theencoding ] ) is indeed the key step which allows the completion of an eventually deterministic two - qubit gate with otherwise nothing else than linear optics and photon pair measurements . the way the encoding step ( [ enc ] ) can be realized",
    "experimentally is discussed in section [ rea ] . in this section",
    "we focus on the general ideas underlying repeat - until - success quantum computing .",
    "once the photons have been created , an entangling phase gate can be implemented by performing an absorbing measurement on the photon pair .",
    "thereby , it is important to choose the photon measurement such that none of the possible outcomes reveals any information about the coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , as mentioned in section ii .",
    "this can be achieved with a photon pair measurements in a basis mutually unbiased @xcite with respect to the computational basis given by the states @xmath39 .",
    "more concretely , all possible outcomes of the photon measurement should be of the form @xmath40 \\ , .\\ ] ] as we see below , a complete set of basis states of this form can be found .",
    "any bias in the amplitudes would yield information about @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , and would therefore not induce a unitary gate on the stationary qubits . detecting the state ( [ unbiased ] ) and absorbing the two photons in the process transfers the encoded state ( [ theencoding ] ) into @xmath41 note that the output state ( [ out ] ) differs from the initial state ( [ original ] ) by a two - qubit phase gate .",
    "let us now consider the angle @xmath42 in this case , the state @xmath43 is a product state and the output ( [ out ] ) differs from the initial state ( [ original ] ) only by local operations .",

    "furthermore , our system relies on components that have been demonstrated in experiment , and is largely implementation independent . despite the no - go theorem for optical bell - state measurements , it is in principle possible to implement a deterministic gate between distant qubits .",
    "however , when losses are taken into account , the gate becomes necessarily probabilistic . in order to achieve robustness against general decoherence and to guarantee high fidelities",
    ", we showed how to construct cluster- or graph - states using the two - qubit gate .",
    "our entangling operation , which produces the bonds in the graph states , is not limited to physically adjacent matter qubits . as a consequence , no extensive swapping operations need to be taken into account in the production of nontrivial graph states .",
    "this architecture for quantum computation is inherently distributed , and hence can be used for integrated quantum computation and communication purposes .",
