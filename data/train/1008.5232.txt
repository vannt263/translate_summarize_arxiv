    "extrasolar planet detections are inexorably pushing toward ever - lower masses , and it seems that each new mass threshold spawns an unavoidably anthropocentric moniker .",
    "first , in 1995 , were the `` hot jupiters '' ( or `` roasters '' ; sudarsky et al .",
    "2000 ) , with minimum masses m  sin  @xmath6 greater than the mass of jupiter @xcite .",
    "the earliest planet discoveries fell into this category due to the well - known radial - velocity selection bias toward detecting massive planets in short - period orbits ( @xmath710 days ) .",
    "the discovery of several neptune - mass ( = 17.4 ) planets in 2004 @xcite brought the `` hot neptune '' into common parlance .",
    "most recently , the discovery of planets with m  sin  @xmath6 less than 10 earth masses has prompted the somewhat misleading appellation of `` super - earth . ''",
    "these planets , of course , are not likely to bear any resemblance to earth , and models of the composition of such objects strongly suggest that almost all of these worlds possess thick atmospheres surrounding a core of rock and ice @xcite .",
    "the anglo - australian planet search ( aaps ) has been in operation at the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope for 11 years , and has published 36 exoplanet discoveries . by integrating for at least 20 minutes on each target in order to average over the stellar p - mode oscillations @xcite , the aaps now achieves velocity precision approaching 1  for bright , inactive stars @xcite . since 2005  june ,",
    "the aaps has been routinely implementing this observing strategy , which has ( together with long continuous observing blocks ) proven instrumental in our recent discovery of a super - earth and two neptune - mass planets orbiting 61  vir @xcite .    in @xcite , we explored the frequency of planets with periods less than @xmath820 days . in that work , we derived detection sensitivities from a continuous 48-night observing campaign targeting 24 bright , stable stars .",
    "the stars have spectral types between g0 and k5 , and they range in mass from 0.77 - 1.28 ; complete details are given in table  1 of @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we consider periods ranging up to 300 days , now making use of nearly 4 years of high - quality data on these 24 stars from the aaps .",
    "the observational data are summarised in table  1 , and the parameters of the five planets which have been found in this sample are given in table  [ planets ] .",
    "we also bring two independent simulation algorithms to bear on these data to derive extremely tight limits on planetary companions in the range @xmath9 . the planetary periods and masses probed by these data",
    "are interesting for two reasons .",
    "first , this region includes the `` period valley '' noted by @xcite and @xcite  a lack of planets with orbital periods of 10 - 100 days .",
    "second , the large amount of high - precision data used here enables the detection of potentially terrestrial - mass planets .",
    "core - accretion simulations which include type  i migration @xcite predict an abundance of planets with masses less than about 10  orbiting within 1  au , and a lack of planets with higher masses in that region ( the `` planet desert '' ) . the large , extremely high - precision data set analysed here represents one of the first able to test these predictions .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the two methods used to derive detection limits from these data .",
    "section  3 presents the results and discusses differences between the two methods . in section  4",
    ", we further discuss the implications of our results with regards to the underlying distribution of exoplanets .",
    "there are two ways to approach the input data for a detection - limit computation : using the actual radial - velocity data @xcite , or creating simulated data sets using the observation dates and uncertainties of the real data @xcite .",
    "we have employed independent methods using each of these approaches to determine the types of planets to which these data were sensitive .",
    "the first simulation technique , described fully in @xcite , seeks to recover simulated keplerian signals ( with appropriate noise terms arising from measurement uncertainties and stellar jitter ) sampled at the epochs of the actual data and retaining the original uncertainties of the actual data .",
    "the simulated velocity curves are analysed using the two - dimensional lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite which extends the standard lomb - scargle periodogram to search eccentricity as well as period space .",
    "the simulated observations for this study were constructed in the following way .",
    "we used a grid of periods , eccentricities and planet masses as input in the same way as @xcite , with periods in the range 2320 days , eccentricities from 0.0 to 0.6 in steps of 0.1 and masses of 0.005 , 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 and 1.0 m@xmath10 .",
    "each set of parameters was simulated 100 times , leading to 72800 simulated velocity curves for each of the 24 stars .",
    "this approach does not use the standard @xmath11-test to determine the reliability of a detection .",
    "instead , it uses four detection criteria as follows @xcite .",
    "first , the rms of the simulated observations must be greater than or equal to the rms of the residuals of the best - fitting model to those data .",
    "that is , the scatter should decrease after the subtraction of a keplerian model .",
    "second , the measured semi - amplitude must be greater than or equal to twice the measured semi - amplitude uncertainty plus the rms of the residuals of the best - fitting model .",
    "third , the measured period must be greater than or equal to twice the measured period uncertainty .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath12 must be less than or equal to three .",
    "the last criterion is only useful when stellar jitter is not included , as discussed by @xcite ; in this paper and @xcite  where jitter is included  it is somewhat redundant .",
    "the other three criteria are a gauge of the reliability of a fit .    with these criteria ,",
    "the method does not rely on the assumptions of the @xmath11-test .",
    "its chief strengths lie in its ability to recover significantly eccentric orbits @xcite which would be undetectable using a standard lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "in addition , because this method performs a full keplerian fit to the simulated data , the distribution of orbital parameters derived from the fits provides valuable information on the biases inherent in fitting radial - velocity data @xcite . for the rest of this paper we will refer to this algorithm as method  1 .",
    "the second technique , described fully in @xcite , adds the keplerian signal of a simulated planet to the original data , and then attempts to recover that signal using a lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite .",
    "previous work using similar methodology includes @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this algorithm as method  2 . in this work",
    ", we required that the recovered period be within 5% of the injected period , and that its false - alarm probability ( fap ) be less than 0.1% .",
    "as the null hypothesis of this method is that the data are purely noise and contain no signals due to real planets , the known planets hd  4308b @xcite and hd  16417b @xcite must be treated differently .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the velocity signature of an unknown planet can be altered by the presence of an additional ( known ) planet .",
    "hence , we have determined the detection limits for hd  4308 and hd  16417 using the method of @xcite wherein the simulated planet is added prior to fitting for and removing the known planet s signal . for the alpha centauri system ( hd  128620/1 ) , we removed a quadratic fit to the data , which provided a satisfactory approximation of the binary orbit over the short time period considered here .",
    "we also removed linear trends from the long - period binaries hd  10360 and hd  10361 .",
    "each star received 7 trials at the 99% recovery level , for trial signals with @xmath130.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , and 0.6 .",
    "in addition , simulations at 90% , 70% , 50% , and 10% recovery were performed at @xmath14 for each star .",
    "this method is computationally faster than method  1 , since each trial only requires the computation of a simple periodogram , and there are considerably fewer such trials .",
    "method  2 also has the advantage that the noise characteristics of the real data are preserved , whereas for simulated data , additional assumptions must be made about the noise term .",
    "however , it breaks down when there are fewer than @xmath1530 data points , as the reliability of the fap calculation is strongly dependent on the number of data points . with limited data ,",
    "even a very strong periodogram peak may fail to reach the 0.1% fap level .",
    "this is less relevant for the current work , as all 24 stars considered here have at least 31 observations ( table  [ rvdata1 ] ) .",
    "we note that @xcite in their appendix give formulae for the fap calculation in the regime of small @xmath16 . for future work , the fap calculations in method",
    "1 can be modified in this manner to better handle small @xmath16 .",
    "for the purpose of this study , we define `` detectability '' as the fraction of simulated planets which were successfully recovered by the detection criteria employed by each method . to obtain a `` big - picture '' view of the types of planets detectable with our current data set , we have averaged the results over all stars and all eccentricities .",
    "figure  [ means ] shows the detectabilities from method  1 ; the contours indicate the fraction of simulated planets that were recovered .",
    "the 99% detection limits obtained in this manner from method  2 are overplotted as a dashed line .",
    "results for each individual star are shown in figures  [ results1][results12 ] .",
    "the detectabilities obtained in this work are highly dependent on the characteristics of the data set ; hd  20794 ( figure  [ results4 ] ) has a large number of observations with little scatter ( @xmath17 , rms=3.43 ) , whereas hd  28255a ( figure  [ results5 ] ) has few data points and considerable scatter ( @xmath18 , rms=7.57 ) .",
    "these results highlight the need to perform detection - limit computations on a star - by - star basis @xcite rather than `` whole of sample . ''",
    "table  [ limitstable ] summarises the results from both methods for each star .",
    "we list the mean velocity amplitude @xmath19 ( averaged over all periods 2 - 300 days ) which was recovered at the 99% and 50% levels for each method .      in general , the results from the two methods are in agreement , though for @xmath20 days , method  1 gives mass limits higher than method  2 by a factor of 2 - 4 ( cf .",
    "[ means ] ) .",
    "the reason for this difference is that method  1 incorporates the added criterion that the semi - amplitude @xmath19 of the recovered keplerian orbit must satisfy @xmath21 . removing this criterion results in an extremely high proportion of false positives ( incorrect detections ) .",
    "method  2 , with a periodogram recovery , has no such constraint on the amplitude , only on the period . both are more conservative than a human would be in analysing an individual observed data set by hand . on the other hand",
    ", they have a quantitative selection process which means that , given their detection criteria and a set of data , one can use these algorithms to draw robust conclusions about planetary frequency and orbital parameter distribution .",
    "both methods  1 and 2 address the question of `` what planets could have been detected by these data ? '' in any such detection - limit determination , the aim is to automate and perform thousands of times what a human investigator would reasonably do to detect a signal @xcite .",
    "this process necessarily involves some sacrifices .",
    "for example , method  2 attempts to detect an injected signal using the standard lomb - scargle periodogram , an extremely fast computation .",
    "however , the lomb - scargle periodogram is most efficient at detecting sinusoidal signals ; when keplerian orbits become moderately eccentric , their shapes can become significantly non - sinusoidal @xcite . to work around this issue ,",
    "@xcite restricted the eccentricities of the injected planets to @xmath22 , a range which includes about 90% of known exoplanets .",
    "the effects of eccentricity remain evident , however , in the `` blind spots '' where method  2 indicates that planets at certain periods are completely undetectable ( figure  [ blindspots ] ) . for each star ,",
    "there are certain trial periods where the data sampling conspires with an injected eccentric signal , such that an ordinary lomb - scargle periodogram does _ not _ exhibit a significant peak at that period .",
    "method  2 would then reject the trial signal , even at a large amplitude ( @xmath23 ) , and these situations result in allegedly undetectable trial signals .",
    "method  1 , however , using the 2dkls periodogram which is much more effective at detecting eccentric signals , would not fall victim to this pathology .",
    "the significance of a periodogram peak obtained by method  2 is computed using the analytic formula given in @xcite .",
    "however , the false - alarm probability ( fap ) obtained by this formula tends to be smaller ( i.e.  more significant ) than that obtained by a bootstrap randomisation procedure @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that noise in radial - velocity data tends to be non - gaussian .",
    "thus , a human would visually inspect the periodogram , then perform a bootstrap fap calculation to obtain an accurate estimate of the believability of any peaks .",
    "the bootstrap fap method , however , requires hours to calculate , rather than the milliseconds it takes for the analytic method , and can therefore not be usefully employed in the analysis of tens of thousands of simulations .",
    "another necessary concession is the requirement that the recovered period be within 5% of the injected period .",
    "the purpose of this constraint is to exclude significant periodogram peaks at aliases of the true period .",
    "spurious periods were also often produced by the lunar cycle ( @xmath830 days ) , and the duration of the densely sampled `` rocky planet search '' ( 48 days ) .",
    "all previously published work using this method @xcite has used this 5% criterion .",
    "this has the effect of preventing incorrect detections ( false positives ) .",
    "method  1 does not have an explicit criterion of this sort , but the four criteria outlined in   2.1 serve to keep the rate of false positives below @xmath81 - 2% ; a detailed discussion of false positives is given in @xcite .",
    "to summarise , method  1 seems to be most appropriate for significantly eccentric orbits because the simulated planets are fitted with a full keplerian model .",
    "since a value of stellar velocity noise ( jitter ) is added to the simulated data in method  1 , that method is more effective when the radial - velocity noise is well - understood .",
    "if the stellar jitter is not well - understood , it is more appropriate to use method  2 since the actual velocity data ( which include all noise sources ) are used .",
    "@xcite and @xcite noted an emerging `` period valley '' between 10 and 100 days ; the @xmath8250 additional planets discovered since then have continued this trend .",
    "@xcite also showed that this feature is mainly attributable to the lack of massive ( m sin @xmath25 2 ) planets in that period range .",
    "our results support this claim , since the 24-star sample contains three low - mass planets with periods between 10 - 100 days ( hd  4308b , hd  16417b , hd  115617c ) , and the data can exclude planets with m sin @xmath25 0.5  at the 99% level for all of this region ( figure  [ means ] ) .",
    "the deficit of higher - mass planets with @xmath26 days is readily apparent , suggesting that the period valley is not a selection effect ; this is consistent with the conclusions reached by @xcite .      at lower masses ( 10 - 100 )",
    "however , the situation is far less clear .",
    "this is an extremely interesting mass range , as core - accretion theory , and numerical simulations based on it , predict a `` planet desert '' to arise from rapid gas accretion by cores once they reach about 10  @xcite .",
    "recent simulations by @xcite showed a pile - up of planets at 0.2 - 0.3  au ( @xmath2830 - 50 days ) .",
    "this is a mass range , then , which _ should _ show detectable features in the structure of the period distribution .",
    "however , this is also a mass range at which serious selection effects impact on the detectability of low - mass planets , and most especially in the critical 15 - 60d orbital period range .",
    "this is why @xcite noted that the predicted pile - up had not yet been observed .",
    "figure  [ lowmass ] shows the period distribution of planets with @xmath29100 .",
    "a steep fall - off in the distribution is evident at @xmath305 days .",
    "this can be understood as arising from two selection effects .",
    "first and most obviously , longer - period planets have weaker radial - velocity signals .",
    "second , planet search observing runs are almost exclusively scheduled on large telescopes during bright time , resulting in a large peaks in the window function at 28d .",
    "the only means to mitigate this sampling problem is to observe through dark lunations .",
    "this is a strategy that only the aaps is currently employing in its `` rocky planet search '' observing campaigns and which ( as demonstrated by the discovery of 61  vir  c , @xmath31d , @xmath32 ) has proven successful in finding low - mass planets in this period range .",
    "when observing strategies are employed which mitigate selection effects in this period regime , we do indeed find low - mass planets ( e.g.  vogt et al .",
    "2010 , otoole et al .",
    "these discoveries indicate that the observed fall - off in the distribution of such planets ( figure  [ lowmass ] ) may  contrary to what is seen at higher masses  indeed merely be a result of observational biases .",
    "if we look at the results of our simulations , they indicate that 10% of planets with @xmath332.7  could have been detected in our sample of 24 stars .",
    "one such planet with an even smaller radial - velocity amplitude has atually been discovered in our sample ( 61  vir  b , @xmath34 ) , suggesting that at least a further nine more such planets could have been missed , and will remain below the detection threshold until additional data are obtained .",
    "in addition , the solar - type dwarf stars typically observed by precision radial - velocity programs have typical rotation periods in the 20 - 50 day range .",
    "hence , emergent periodicities are not usually believed until sufficient data are in hand to be confident that the periodicity is planetary in origin rather than due to rotational modulation by starspots .",
    "this selection bias suggests that low - mass planets with @xmath2830 - 50 days may be present in extant radial - velocity data sets , but as yet not believed and unpublished .",
    "the importance of planetary migration has been appreciated for some time @xcite .",
    "the modelling work of @xcite and @xcite has provided evidence that observational data for exoplanets are consistent with a model where planets are formed at around 5  au and then undergo migration .",
    "this leads to a distribution of planetary semimajor axis @xmath35 that depends on log(@xmath35 ) .",
    "although this scenario provides a good match to observations ( e.g.  armitage 2007 ) , migration rates at short orbital periods are expected to be different for different mass planets .",
    "the simulations of @xcite indicate three regimes : ( 1 ) low - mass planets ( @xmath360.5 ) migrate inwards and stall at approximately half the rotation period of the star , ( 2 ) high - mass planets ( 10 ) should collide with the star , and ( 3 ) the intermediate - mass ( 1 ) planet population should have an inner edge located at twice the roche - limit @xcite . for the purposes of our models , we implement a distribution of planetary semimajor axis that depends on log(@xmath35 ) , referred to here as ",
    "logarithmic migration .",
    "    although our target star sample and number of detections is small , we can use the fact that it is well - characterised in an attempt to understand the features of the larger inhomogenous data set of radial velocity exoplanets . following the work of @xcite and using our computed detectabilities and a simplistic logarithmic migration @xcite , figure  [ newfig7 ]",
    "shows the expected number of planets for different underlying mass functions as a function of semi - major axis for the case of equal numbers of exoplanets in each bin .",
    "the bold asterisks represent the planets detected from this sample ( table  [ planets ] ) .",
    "we find that the total expected number of detections for different assumed mass functions observed with our sample varies by a factor of about two for the mass functions shown , with all giving a smooth fall - off in the number of detections toward longer periods .",
    "thus , although the peak of the histogram serves to approximately characterise our detection of two exoplanets in the 10 - 20 day period bin and is consistent with those below the threshold , the clear rise at longer periods in the observed distribution in figure  [ newfig7 ] is not reproduced .",
    "however , it must be noted that the sample of all radial velocity exoplanets shown in figure  [ newfig7 ] is highly inhomogeneous and represents an observed sample of a higher mass range .    although figure  [ newfig7 ] indicates that the distribution in period space is relatively insensitive to different mass functions , we find greater sensitivity when detectability is plotted as a function of mass .",
    "following @xcite , we show in figure  [ rob4 ] the expected detections for our sample as a function of mass for a variety of assumed mass functions .",
    "we find that the peak in the expected number of _ observed _ exoplanets moves for different mass functions .",
    "@xmath37=@xmath38 leads to a peak in the number of detected planets around 0.02  ( 6.3 ) , the @xmath37=@xmath39 expected detections peak at around 0.05  ( 16 ) while the flatter @xmath37=@xmath40 mass function produces an expected detection peak at around 0.10  ( 32 ) .",
    "given that we have found two exoplanet signals in the 16 - 25   minimum mass range ( corresponding to the 0.05  or 16   bin in figure  [ rob4 ] we may consider these as providing rough limits on the underlying mass function as determined by how changes in the mass function cause the peak of detections to move toward and away from the 0.05  ( 16 ) bin .",
    "we find the peak moves from the 0.02 to the 0.05  bin for @xmath37 values shallower than @xmath37=@xmath41 and from 0.05  to 0.1  at @xmath37=@xmath42 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the peak mass for different mass functions is sensitive to migration .",
    "if no migration is employed then the mass function peak moves away from the 0.05  ( 16 ) bin when 0.6 @xmath43 @xmath37 @xmath43 1.2 .",
    "based on poisson - counting statistics of two detections our simulations indicate a normalisation of 0.17@xmath440.12 ( corresponding to the f value presented in @xcite ) .",
    "our estimate of the underlying mass function shown in figure  [ rob4 ] is consistent with the first attempt presented in @xcite .",
    "that is , the additional planet detections in this sample and the comprehensive detection limits presented here serve to strengthen the case for an underlying planet mass function of the form @xmath45 .",
    "given that we robustly do not detect more massive planets in this sample , flatter mass functions are not favoured .",
    "we have shown , using two independent simulation algorithms , that recent data from the aaps are capable of placing meaningful limits on the population of potentially terrestrial , sub - neptune - mass planets orbiting nearby stars . as we are able to have detected all planets with at least a saturn mass in the period range @xmath26 days",
    ", we conclude that the observed lack of massive planets ( @xmath24100 ) with periods 10 - 100 days is real and not due to selection effects .",
    "however , we conclude that the shortage of lower - mass planets ( @xmath27100 ) predicted by core - accretion theory in this period range may arise from observational selection biases against detecting such planets .",

    "<S> both methods are more conservative than a human analysing an individual observed data set , as is demonstrated by the fact that both techniques would detect the radial velocity signals announced as exoplanets for the 61  vir system in 50% of trials . </S>",
    "<S> there are modest differences between the methods which can be recognised as arising from particular criteria that they adopt . </S>",
    "<S> what both processes deliver is a _ quantitative _ selection process such that one can use them to draw quantitative conclusions about planetary frequency and orbital parameter distribution from a given data set . </S>",
    "<S> averaging over all 24 stars , in the period range @xmath1300 days and the eccentricity range @xmath2 , we could have detected 99% of planets with velocity amplitudes @xmath37.1 . </S>",
