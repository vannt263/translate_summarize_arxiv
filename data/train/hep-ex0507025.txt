    "the decay of @xmath9 mesons to a three - body charmless final state offers the possibility of investigating the properties of the weak interaction and provides information on the complex quark couplings described in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements  @xcite , as well as on models of hadronic decays .",
    "measurements of direct -violating asymmetries and constraints on the magnitudes and the phases of the ckm matrix elements can be obtained from individual decay channels in  @xcite , which are dominated by decays through intermediate resonances .",
    "for example , the ckm angle  @xmath10 can be extracted from the interference between the decay @xmath6 , which has no -violating phase , and other modes such as @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "studies of these decays can also help to clarify the nature of the resonances involved , not all of which are well understood .",
    "of particular interest is whether the @xmath13 resonance , which has been observed in other experiments  @xcite , is also present in  decays .",
    "an analysis of the full three - body kinematic space is necessary to model the interference and extract branching fractions .",
    "observations of -meson decays to the  three - body final states have already been reported by the belle and  collaborations using a method that treats each intermediate decay incoherently  @xcite .",
    "these studies have only observed @xmath14 , in which other possible resonance contributions are treated as background .",
    "the first measurement of the total branching fraction for  was found to be @xmath15  @xcite . here , we present results from a full amplitude analysis for  decay modes based on a  data sample containing  pairs collected with the  detector  @xcite at the slac pep - ii asymmetric - energy  storage ring  @xcite operating at the @xmath16 resonance at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath17  @xmath18 .",

    "details of the  detector are described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "charged particles are measured with the combination of a silicon vertex tracker ( svt ) , which consists of five layers of double - sided detectors , and a 40-layer central drift chamber ( dch ) in a 1.5-t solenoidal magnetic field .",
    "this provides a transverse momentum resolution for the combined tracking system of @xmath21 , where the sum is in quadrature and @xmath22 is measured in @xmath23 .",
    "charged - particle identification is accomplished by combining information on the specific ionization @xmath24 in the two tracking devices and the angle of emission of cherenkov radiation in an internally reflecting ring - imaging cherenkov detector ( dirc ) covering the central region .",
    "the @xmath25 resolution from the drift chamber is typically about @xmath26 for pions .",
    "the cherenkov angle resolution of the dirc is measured to be 2.4 mrad , for the quartz refractive index of 1.473 , which provides better than 3  @xmath13 separation between charged kaons and pions over the full kinematic range of this analysis .",
    "the dirc is surrounded by an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) , comprising 6580 csi(tl ) crystals , which is used to measure the energies and angular positions of photons and electrons .",
    "the emc is used to veto electrons in this analysis .",
    "hadronic events are selected based on track multiplicity and event topology . backgrounds from non - hadronic events are reduced by requiring the ratio of fox - wolfram moments @xmath27  @xcite to be less than 0.98 .",
    "-meson candidates are reconstructed from events that have four or more charged tracks .",
    "each track is required to be well measured and originate from the beam spot .",
    "they must have at least 12 hits in the dch , a minimum transverse momentum of 100 @xmath28 , and a distance of closest approach to the beam spot of less than 1.5  in the transverse plane and less than 10  along the beam axis .",
    "charged tracks identified as electrons are rejected .",
    "the -meson candidates are formed from three - charged - track combinations and particle identification criteria are applied .",
    "the efficiency of selecting pions is approximately 95% , while the probability of misidentifying kaons as pions is 15% .",
    "the -meson candidates energies and momenta are required to satisfy the kinematic constraints detailed in section  [ sec : finalsel ] .",
    "backgrounds from @xmath29 are high and are suppressed by imposing requirements on event - shape variables calculated in the @xmath30 rest frame .",
    "the first discriminating variable is , the cosine of the angle between the thrust axis of the selected  candidate and the thrust axis of the rest of the event ( all remaining charged and neutral candidates ) .",

    "these ranges are asymmetric about the nominal masses  @xcite in order to remove decays in which a lepton ( @xmath45 ) or kaon has been misidentified as a pion .",
    "we study the remaining backgrounds from charmless  decays and from charm decays that escape the vetoes using a large sample of monte carlo ( mc ) simulated  decays equivalent to approximately five times the integrated luminosity for the data .",
    "any events that pass the selection criteria are further studied using exclusive mc samples to estimate reconstruction efficiency and yields .",
    "we find that the only significant background arises from  decays , in which the kaon has been misidentified as a pion .",
    "we also consider the decay ,  to be a background , since the  candidates decay weakly and do not interfere with other @xmath46 resonances in .",
    "we suppress this background by fitting two oppositely charged pions from each  candidate to a common vertex when the invariant mass of the pair is below 0.6  @xmath47 .",
    "this vertex corresponds to the  decay point for true  candidates .",
    "we remove  decays that have fitted  candidates with masses between 476 and 519  @xmath48(@xmath49 ) .",
    "a further background in this analysis comes from signal events that have been misreconstructed by switching one or more particles from the decay of the signal  meson with particles from the other  meson in the event .",
    "the amount of this background is estimated from mc studies and is found to be very small ; it accounts for 0.6% of the final data sample in the signal region ( defined in section  [ sec : finalsel ] ) and is therefore neglected in this analysis .",
