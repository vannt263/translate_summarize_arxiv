    "the gulf plains bioregion of northern australia is a large area of tropical savanna on extensive alluvial plains and coastal areas @xcite .",
    "the region experiences a monsoonal climate with a winter dry season and a summer wet season , with the wet season typically extending from october to april . a monsoon season from december",
    "to march brings significant rainfall , often causing flooding throughout the region .",
    "flooding can be extensive , and floodwaters can remain on pasture for several weeks . in general , the floodplains are resilient ecosystems , adapted to the wet and dry seasons , with grasslands responding rapidly after the wet season .",
    "however , periods of extended inundation can have an adverse lasting effect on pasture , resulting in the death of grasses and seed bank .",
    "the summer of 2008/2009 in this region experienced one of the most severe floods on record , with widespread prolonged flooding from january to march @xcite .",
    "there was widespread reports of death of grasses , and a lack of recovery the following year .",
    "the region is remote with limited infrastructure , so a remotely sensed approach to monitor the extent and the timing of the event is desirable . in this paper",
    ", we use the normalized difference vegetation index ( ndvi ) from nasa s moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer ( modis ) to determine the timing , effect size and recovery time following an extended flood event .",
    "modis data is used extensively to identify disturbance from time series data , though this typically uses image difference techniques using only a small number of image dates ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , or uses univariate time series models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the former approach is not suitable as it ignores the time series structure present in the problem , while the latter method ignores the information available through common trends , as well as any spatial correlation present in the data . unlike these methods",
    "the approach presented in this paper , uses all of the data and takes account of both the temporal and spatial correlation structure in the data .",
    "specifically , we propose a method for analysing data with an unknown number of changepoints that is applicable to high - dimensional multivariate time series and space - time data .",
    "the detection of change in time series and space - time data sets is of paramount importance in many areas of statistics , and as a consequence it has been the focus of much recent research ; see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "mixture innovation models , cast in a conditionally gaussian state space framework , provide an intuitive and flexible approach for modeling non - linear effects , and furthermore they can be used for models that allow for an unknown number of changepoints .",
    "the idea behind this approach is to account for change by modeling the state innovation using a mixture distribution .",
    "while approximate methods have been developed for this class of models , see for example @xcite and @xcite , it has been the advent of modern simulation methods that has facilitated the development of exact methods .",
    "early methods utilizing markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) include @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a drawback of these approaches is that sampling the auxiliary discrete variables , used to define the mixture on the innovations , is done conditionally on the states .",
    "this often results in a poorly mixing mcmc sampler because of the high dependence between the states and the auxiliary discrete variables . for the univariate conditionally gaussian state space model , @xcite propose an algorithm that generates the auxiliary discrete variables in @xmath0 operations , without conditioning on the states , where @xmath1 is the sample size .",
    "this is an important development because it overcomes the potentially high dependence between the auxiliary discrete variables and the states inherent in the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "our article makes four major methodological contributions to the bayesian literature .",
    "first , the methodology of @xcite is extended to multivariate conditionally gaussian state space models .",
    "second , let @xmath2 be the dimension of the observation vector in any time period . then for a fairly general class of @xmath3dimensional state space models , which apply to both multivariate time series and space - time analysis , we show how to sample from the posterior distribution of interest using @xmath4 operations , rather than @xmath5 operations , in the case of a naive implementation of the algorithm .",
    "we show that this results in a increase in the speed that is of practical significance ( possibly millions of times faster ) for the size of data that is of interest to us .",
    "third , the structure of the prior for the model and the mcmc methodology allows us to average over the model space generated by the common components in , possibly high dimensional , multivariate time series and space - time models .",
    "this feature of our approach is very important at a practical level , as well as being theoretically attractive , particularly as the number of common components increase in the specified model .",
    "fourth , we propose a general approach for sampling candidates in the latent state process of our model that is efficient with respect to both computation and simulation .",
    "in particular , we show how to draw in order @xmath6 operations any parameter that enters the model only through the state transition equation . here , generating the parameter is done from its conditional distribution with the states integrated out .",
    "we believe that each of these contributions is necessary in producing a method , which contains an adequately rich model structure and can be feasibly used to analyze data sets of the size that are of interest to fields such as remote sensing .",
    "the new methodology is used to detect change in the ndvi that is measured from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellite .",
    "the space - time data set consists of nearly 18000 spatial locations at 268 time points .",
    "the article is organised as follows . section  [ sec : condionally - gaussian - multivariat ] describes the conditionally gaussian multivariate state space model and the new sampling algorithm",
    ". section  [ sec : dynamic - factor - model ] describes the hierarchical multivariate time series and space - time model , its efficient implementation , a computational comparison of the efficient implementation and a naive implementation and a description of an mcmc algorithm for the model .",
    "section  [ sec : analysis - of - simulated ] demonstrates the methodology on simulated data .",
    "section  [ sec : modelling - ndvi ] utilizes the new methodology to analyze structural change in the ndvi for the gulf plains bioregion in northern australia . data .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes the article .",
    "all proofs of the results in the article are in the appendix .",
    "the observation vector @xmath7 for @xmath8 for the conditionally gaussian state space model ( cgssm ) is generated by @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are system matrices and @xmath13 is independently and normally distributed , with mean @xmath14 and a covariance @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes an identity matrix of order @xmath2 .",
    "the state vector , @xmath17 for @xmath18 is generated by the difference equation @xmath19 with @xmath20 the transition matrix @xmath21 @xmath22 and the disturbance vector @xmath23 is defined to be serially uncorrelated and normally distributed with a mean @xmath24 and a covariance matrix @xmath25 .",
    "the system matrices in ( [ eq : meas ] ) and ( [ eq : state ] ) are functions of the unknown parameters @xmath26 and also depend on a sequence of discrete random variables @xmath27 which can be used to model non - linear effects in an intuitive manner .",
    "the state space model is completed by specifying the distribution of the initial state @xmath28 as @xmath29 with mean @xmath30 and covariance @xmath31 . for notational convenience throughout , denote @xmath32 and @xmath33 where this convention extends to any vector or matrix .",
    "algorithm  [ alg : mcmc ] provides a general way of estimating the model described in ( [ eq : meas])([eq : init_state ] ) .    1 .",
    "sample @xmath34 from @xmath35 2 .",
    "sample @xmath36 from @xmath37 .",
    "sample @xmath38 from @xmath39 .",
    "step 3 of algorithm  [ alg : mcmc ] is model specific .",
    "steps 1 and 2 can be completed using algorithms that are applicable to the general state space model .",
    "specifically , in step 1 , @xmath40 is sampled from @xmath41 by sampling each @xmath42 for @xmath8 from @xmath43 the algorithm used in this computation is described below . in step 2 , @xmath44 is drawn from @xmath45 this step , which involves sampling the state from its full conditional posterior distribution , can be achieved using any of the algorithms developed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "sampling @xmath40 is the most difficult step , and is achieved through a generalization of results presented by @xcite who propose an algorithm to efficiently sample @xmath46 for the univariate state space model , i.e.  when @xmath47 is a scalar .",
    "their contribution is to show that @xmath40 can be sampled in @xmath48 operations , without needing to condition on the states @xmath49 the idea builds on the relation @xmath50 where the term @xmath51 is obtained from the prior , and may depend on unknown parameters , the term @xmath52 is obtained using one step of the kalman filter and the term @xmath53 is obtained by one forward step after initially doing a set of backward recursions .    given lemmas [ lemma1 ] , [ lemma2 ] and [ lemma3 ] ( see the appendix ) , an algorithm for sampling @xmath40 from @xmath54 is defined as follows :    1 .",
    "given the current value of @xmath46 for @xmath55 compute @xmath56 and @xmath57 using the recursion given in [ lemma1 ] .",
    "2 .   for @xmath8 1 .   compute @xmath58 using [ lemma2 ] , 2 .   compute @xmath53 using [ lemma3 ] , 3 .",
    "for all values of @xmath59 compute @xmath60 and form a probability mass function and use it to sample @xmath61 4 .",
    "re - run one step of the kalman filter , defined in [ lemma2 ] , based on the sample @xmath61",
    "we consider a general modeling framework that applies to both multivariate time series and space - time analysis . in particular , the observation equation at time @xmath62 for @xmath8 for the observations , @xmath7 is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a matrix of basis functions , which is possibly spatially referenced , @xmath65 is a vector of common components and @xmath13 is a vector of serially uncorrelated , normally distributed disturbances , with diagonal covariance matrices @xmath66 .",
    "the matrix of basis functions , @xmath67 in the case of multivariate time series analysis is typically taken as unknown and the model in ( [ eq : dfm ] ) is commonly referred to as a dynamic factor model ( dfm ) . in space - time analysis a wide variety of basis functions",
    "have been used in its specification , including empirical orthogonal functions eof , fourier and wavelet bases , amongst many other methods ; see @xcite for a thorough review .",
    "when @xmath68 is unknown , it is assumed to be a function of a vector of parameters , @xmath69 which needs to be estimated .",
    "we specify the structure of @xmath68 when applying the model in sections  [ sec : analysis - of - simulated ] and  [ sec : modelling - ndvi ] .",
    "regardless of the specification of the matrix of basis functions , its purpose is the same : to provide a mapping between the high dimensional set of observations and a low dimensional system that aims to capture the dynamic characteristics in the data generating process .",
    "this method of dimension reduction is necessary computationally and practically sensible .",
    "for example , in remotely sensed data one may expect that observations in woodlands might exhibit a common temporal signature , and data points in grasslands exhibit a different but also common temporal signature .",
    "our models can take advantage of such features present in the data .",
    "typically the common terms , @xmath70 are sums of a number of components such as trend , regression and autoregressive components . to estimate the model in a state space framework , it is convenient to define @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a selection matrix that is used so that the model in ( [ eq : dfm ] ) can be written in state space form .",
    "it follows that , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a matrix of regressors , @xmath75 is a vector of regression coefficients , @xmath76 and @xmath77 is a random vector that is normally distributed with a covariance matrix @xmath78 .",
    "it is immediately apparent that ( [ eq : meas_dfm ] ) and @xmath79 can be expressed as the cgssm in ( [ eq : meas ] ) and ( [ eq : state ] ) , by defining @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83 note that for certain classes of basis functions , it may be necessary to impose identification restrictions on the model .",
    "modeling multiple change points , using a variation of algorithm  [ alg : mcmc ] , is accomplished by defining @xmath84 to be a function of @xmath61 specifying a model to handle changepoints in this way is simple and flexible .",
    "for example , we can specify each common component to consist of an autoregressive process and a level that allows for shifts in the conditional mean and slope of the process .",
    "this is achieved , for @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the set @xmath87 by defining @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an autoregressive cyclical process , @xmath90 is the level , @xmath91 is a vector of regressors and @xmath92 is a vector of regression coefficients .",
    "specifically , we define @xmath89 as a damped stochastic cycle , such that @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a persistence parameter , @xmath95 is a hyperparameter that defines the period of the cycle , @xmath96 is an auxiliary variable defined by @xmath97 @xmath98 is a scale parameter and @xmath99 and @xmath100 are standard normal random variables .",
    "the stochastic cycle reverts to a standard first order autoregressive process when @xmath101 for further details on stochastic cycles , see @xcite .",
    "the cycle is used to capture seasonal effects in the analysis in this paper .",
    "the level @xmath90 is modeled as @xmath102 where @xmath103 captures the slope for the @xmath104 common component , @xmath105 is a discrete random variable that is used to accommodate change in the level , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are independent standard normal random variables ; @xmath108 is a discrete random variable that is used to model changes in the slope .    for @xmath85 the prior for @xmath94 is a beta distribution , @xmath109 , which ensures that @xmath110 is a stationary process , with a positive autocorrelation function .",
    "the prior for @xmath95 is a _ stretched _ beta distribution , @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a beta distribution that has been translated and stretched over the open set @xmath113 , i.e. , if @xmath114 then @xmath115 .",
    "let @xmath116 be the @xmath117 element of @xmath118 then , the @xmath116 are _ a priori _ independent , i.e. , @xmath119@xmath120 and @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a bernoulli auxiliary random variable , such that @xmath123 for @xmath85 the prior for @xmath98 is an inverted gamma distribution , i.e. , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the degrees of freedom parameter and @xmath126 is the scale parameter .    in our article , the discrete random variables for the @xmath104 common component , @xmath127 and @xmath128 are used to capture changes in the level and slope , respectively .",
    "the elements of @xmath129 are assumed independent _ a priori _ with prior distributions that are inverted gamma , where for @xmath130 @xmath131 and @xmath132 it is assumed that @xmath133 is multinomial , where at each time point only one change point ( in either the level or the slope ) is allowed for all @xmath134 while we can specify a more general prior , we found that this prior works well for the data sets we have analyzed .",
    "the multinomial prior distribution for @xmath59 is defined assuming that we are in the null state , i.e. @xmath135 with probability @xmath136 it is further assumed that @xmath59 takes any other possible values with equal probability .",
    ".[tab : prior_k]prior distribution for @xmath59 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the mcmc analysis using algorithm  [ alg : mcmc_dfm ] is run for 5000 iterations , with the first one thousand iterations are discarded as burnin .",
    "table  [ tab : mcmc_output ] reports the estimated output for some of the parameters from the mcmc analysis of the modis data set .",
    "it is clear that for each factor there is a moderate to high level of persistence in the stochastic cycle and for each case the estimated period of the cycle is close to a year , which can be expected .",
    "note that for a period of one year we expect @xmath137 from the inefficiency factors it is evident that the mcmc estimates are extremely efficient , and in fact for all , of the nearly 18000 parameters , are smaller than nine ; see @xcite for further details on inefficiency factors .",

    "the trend is the marginal posterior mean estimate of @xmath138 for @xmath8 and can be interpreted as the longer term trend in the data .",
    "the seasonal component is the marginal posterior mean estimate of @xmath139 for @xmath140 and for @xmath141 is @xmath142 the image plots highlight where each particular component has most impact .",
    "essentially the lighter the area the more influence the particular trend has over the data of the corresponding region .",
    "visual inspection of the image plot for the first component , ( a ) , reveals that the corresponding common component in the data is least influential where the water feature is present . for this region , examination of the trend",
    ", suggests that ndvi was initially decreasing , but has recovered in more recent years .",
    "a moderate el nio in 2002/2003 resulted in well below average rainfall in this area , and the impact on vegetation is clear in the trend .",
    "la nia events in 2007/2008 and again in 2008/2009 produced above average rainfall , and , as shown in the trend , resulted in a general increase in vegetation in the region . from the image plot",
    "we can see that the second component , ( b ) , is most influential in areas close to the river and its tributaries .",
    "structural change is clearly present in the trend for this component .",
    "in particular , the trend suggests a substantial drop in ndvi in 2009 , corresponding to a known period of prolonged inundation in the region . while periodic inundation is common in much of the lower lying areas in the region , the floods in 2008/2009 were unusual in that areas were under water for a much longer period .",
    "visual interpretation of the trend suggests that for this region the level of ndvi does not immediately recover to previous levels , adding weight to the theory that the prolonged period of inundation caused long term damage to the vegetation .",
    "the third and fourth components are less interesting .",
    "the calculation of the eof bases suggest that they account for far less variation in the data .",
    "arguably , component three , ( c ) , seems to have most influence in the outer tributaries of the water system .",
    "the trend suggests an overall increase of ndvi over time for this region , at least above and beyond that of what is explained by components ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the fourth component , ( d ) , arguably shows an increase in ndvi over time as well , up until the point of the inundation , where it drops and flattens off .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the seasonal pattern is most regular away from the river and tributaries .",
    "this is not unexpected as this region is less susceptible to flooding , in which case we can expect a more uniform response to climatic factors .",
    "this article introduces a bayesian methodology for the detection of structural change in multivariate time series and space - time data .",
    "remotely sensed data is used in the analysis of the gulf plains bioregion , where , using the proposed methodology , we found evidence of structural change in a region that had been inundated for an extended period of time .",
    "areas most affected by the 2009 flood have not recovered to pre - flood levels in over two and a half years .",
