    "a quite general class of long range potentials is the inverse power law potentials .",
    "generally , these potentials are defined as pseudo - potentials or as effective potentials ; the lattice sums with these potentials are used in solids state physics for the computation of structural integrals @xcite ; for instance , in the computation of the energy needed to permit the formation of an atomic vacancy in metals @xcite or also to study the effect of a piezoelectric medium on structural properties of electronic bilayers in heterogeneous junctions algaas - gaas @xcite . the dependence of the liquid - gas transition for inverse power law interactions with @xmath1 has also been studied in reference @xcite .",
    "although , the analytical form of pseudo - potentials or effective potentials used are more complicated than a simple inverse power law , but rather like @xmath2 , in the following , we will restrict ourselves to @xmath3 .",
    "+ for a system with periodic boundary conditions in the three dimensions of the space , lattice sums of pseudo - potentials are @xmath4 with @xmath5 a symbolic notation for the @xmath6 dimensional periodic images of the basic cell that contains the system ; the basic cell is noted @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 for tridimensional periodicities , or @xmath9 for two dimensional periodicities ) .",
    "+ for @xmath10 , this class of potential corresponds to the coulomb interactions which lattice summations have been derived in various ways including ewald methods @xcite , lekner @xcite or plane - wise summations@xcite .",
    "+ the case @xmath11 is also of a large interest in liquids and condensed matter physics , especially when dipolar interactions between particles are present in the systems @xcite .",
    "+ the limit @xmath12 corresponds to the hard sphere model ; indeed , one has @xmath13 the limit @xmath14 corresponds to an interaction potential that do not depend on the distance between the particles ( @xmath15 ) ; thus , from the point of view of computer simulations , the limit @xmath14 corresponds to the ideal monoatomic gas .",
    "logarithmic interactions or coulomb interaction in two dimensional systems can not be obtained in the limit @xmath14 of inverse power law interactions of eq.([powl_1 ] ) .",
    "however , it may be obtained with the help of the relation @xmath16=-\\ln r\\ ] ] the ewald method for logarithmic interactions has been derived by perram and de leeuw @xcite .",
    "one has to take into account eq.([powl_log ] ) to recover their results from the ewald sums for inverse power - law interactions developed in this paper .",
    "+ inverse power law interactions are also used in long - range dispersion force in lennard - jones fluids ( @xmath17 ) ; some significant corrections are obtained by using ewald summations in lennard - jones fluid rather than using a truncation of the potential @xcite .",
    "+ the lattice sum ( [ powl_1 ] ) for arbitrary @xmath0 has been obtained by misra , born and bradburn @xcite for tridimensional systems .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to compute this lattice sum for quasi - two dimensional systems ( systems with spatial periodicities in only two directions of the space ) .",
    "+ there are mainly two ways to obtain ewald methods for quasi - two dimensional systems .",
    "first , one may obtain this formulation by taking the so - called parry s limit @xcite ; it consists in assuming that one of the spatial periodicity ( say @xmath18 ) is extremely large compared to the other , the ewald summations for tridimensional systems in the limit @xmath19 are ewald summations for quasi - two dimensional systems .",
    "this derivation has been applied successfully to coulomb , yukawa and dipolar interactions @xcite .",
    "the second method consists in the application of poisson - jacobi identities ( discrete fourier transforms ) to the two dimensional periodicities of the quasi - two dimensional systems .",
    "both derivations are fully equivalent and they provide exactly the same results , this was shown extensively for coulomb , yukawa and dipolar interactions @xcite .",
    "+ another method is based on a decomposition of the charge distributions with the help of different screening functions @xcite .",
    "this method has been applied to coulomb interactions @xcite , to yukawa potentials @xcite and inverse power - law interactions @xcite .",
    "the screening of charges is frequently taken as a gaussian function , but this choice is not restrictive @xcite .",
    "+ the poisson - jacobi identity for lattice sums reads as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the volume of the basic cell , @xmath22 the reciprocal lattice associated with the lattice made of the periodic images of the system and @xmath23 the fourier transform of @xmath24 defined as @xmath25 in this paper , we will derive ewald summations for inverse power - law interactions in quasi - two dimensional systems by using both methods ; then , using the equivalence between both derivations , we will obtain a new analytical relation for a fourier transform involving the incomplete gamma function .",
    "this fourier transform is expressed in term of the generalized incomplete gamma function or incomplete bessel function @xcite .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a short derivation of the ewald method for the lattice summations with inverse power - law interactions in three dimensional systems .",
    "then , using the result of section 2 , in section 3 we derive the ewald method for quasi - two dimensional systems by taking the parry s limit and also by using the poisson - jacobi identity ; the equivalence between both derivations of the ewald method for quasi - two dimensional systems then allows us to obtain a new fourier transform for incomplete gamma function . in section 4 ,",
    "energies of the generalized restrictive primitive model of electrolytes ( @xmath0-rpm ) and of the generalized one component plasma model ( @xmath0-ocp ) are given for the tridimensional , quasi - two dimensional and monolayers systems .",
    "several numerical results , using monte - carlo simulations for @xmath0-rpm and @xmath0-ocp monolayers systems are reported .",
    "to apply the ewald method to inverse power - law potentials , we begin as it is done for coulomb interaction , by using the relation @xmath26 then we split the lattice sum into two summations using a convergence parameter @xmath27 .",
    "one of the summations is on the periodic images of the system and the other one is transformed by using poisson - jacobi identity , both being rapidly convergent .",
    "we have @xmath28 for the second contribution , we use the poisson - jacobi relation written as @xmath29    .analytical formulas for the real and reciprocal space contributions in tridimensional ewald summations for inverse power law interactions @xmath30 for some integer values of @xmath0 . @xmath31 and",
