    "thus , it is observed that variation in the value of @xmath68 has a significant impact on the extent of separation of the current viscous ehrde and increase in @xmath68 takes the model away from @xmath0cdm , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are fixed at @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively .",

    "<S> in the present work we report a study on the viscous extended holographic ricci dark energy ( ehrde ) model under the assumption of existence of bulk viscosity in the linear barotropic fluid and the ehrde in the framework of standard eckart theory of relativistic irreversible thermodynamics and it has been observed that the non - equilibrium bulk viscous pressure is significantly smaller than the local equilibrium pressure . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the equation of state ( eos ) parameter and observed that the eos behaves like  quintom \" and is consistent with the constraints set by observational data sets from snls3 , bao and planck + wmap9 + wigglez measurements in the reference s. kumar and l. xu , _ phys . </S>",

    "<S> analysis of statefinder parameters has shown the possibility of attainment of @xmath0cdm phase under current model and at the same time it has been pointed out that the for @xmath1 i.e. current universe , the statefinder pair is different from that of @xmath0cdm and the @xmath0cdm can be attained in a later stage of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of stability has shown that although the viscous ehrde along with viscous barotropic is classically unstable in the present epoch , it can lead to a stable universe in very late stage . </S>",
    "<S> considering an universe enveloped by event horizon we have observed validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics . </S>"
