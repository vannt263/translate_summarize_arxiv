    "it has become clear in recent years that transiting extrasolar planets ( teps ) , especially those around bright stars , are extremely valuable for understanding the physical properties of planetary bodies .",
    "the transit itself is a periodic event , which  together with high precision spectroscopic observations and radial velocity ( rv ) follow - up  reveals a number of key parameters , notably the relative radius of the planet with respect to the star , and the true mass of the planet without the inclination ambiguity .",
    "these allow determination of the mean density of the planet , and an insight into its basic structural properties .",
    "these advantages have been realized early on , and the recent rise in the detection of teps is due to a number of dedicated transit searches , such as tres @xcite , xo @xcite , superwasp @xcite , ogle ( targeting fainter stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hatnet @xcite .",
    "at the time of this writing , the number of published teps with a unique identification is @xmath12 , with @xmath13 of these due to systematic searches .",
    "the properties of known teps already span a wide range , from the hot neptune gj436b with a mass of @xmath14 @xcite to xo-3 with @xmath15 @xcite , from short period orbits like ogle - tr-56b with @xmath16days @xcite to @xmath17days of b @xcite .",
    "although most of these planets have circular orbits , some planets with significant eccentricities , such as hat - p-2b @xcite , have also been reported .",
    "teps have been discovered in a wide range of environments , from orbiting m dwarfs ( gj436b ) up to mid f - dwarfs , such as hat - p-7b @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations have been thriving during this vigorous discovery era , some focusing on the radius of these planets @xcite , and others on the atmospheres ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to mention two of the key observable properties of transiting planets .",
    "when confronting theory with observations , it is also essential to use accurate observational values , along with proper error estimates .",
    "the recent compilation of tep parameters by @xcite represents a step forward in this sense .",
    "it was also noted throughout these works that a much larger sample is required for better understanding of the underlying physics , i.e.  more planets are needed to populate the mass  radius ( or other ) parameter space , to improve the statistical significance of correlations between planetary and stellar parameters , and to reveal any previously undetected correlations that may shed light on the physical processes governing the formation and evolution of teps .",
    "the hatnet survey has been a major contributor to tep discoveries .",
    "operational since 2003 , it has covered approximately 7% of the northern sky , searching for teps around bright stars ( @xmath18mag ) .",
    "hatnet operates six wide field instruments : four at the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) in arizona , and two on the roof of the submillimeter array hangar ( sma ) of sao . since 2006",
    ", hatnet has announced and published 9 teps . in this work",
    "we report on the tenth such discovery ..",
    "the transits of hat - p-10b were detected with one of the hatnet telescopes , , located at flwo .",
    "the region around gsc  02340 - 01714 , a field internally labeled as g213 , was observed on a nightly basis between 2005 october 3 and 2006 march 14 , whenever weather conditions permitted .",
    "we gathered 2870 exposures of 5 minutes at a 5.5-minute cadence .",
    "each image contained approximately @xmath19 stars down to @xmath20 .",
    "for the brightest stars in the field we achieved a per - image photometric precision of 4mmag .",
    "the calibration of the hatnet frames was done utilizing standard procedures .",
    "the calibrated frames were then subject to star detection and astrometry , as described in @xcite .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on each image at the stellar centroids derived from the 2mass catalog @xcite and the individual astrometrical solutions .",
    "the resulting light curves  were decorrelated against trends using the external parameter decorrelation technique ( epd , see * ? ? ? * ) and the trend filtering algorithm ( tfa , see * ? ? ?",
    "the light curves were searched for periodic box - like signals using the box least squares method ( bls , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we detected a significant signal in the light curve of gsc  02340 - 01714 ( also known as 2mass  03092855 + 3040249 ; @xmath21 , @xmath22 ; j2000 ) , with a depth of @xmath23mmag , and a period of @xmath24days .",
    "the dip had a relative duration ( first to last contact ) of @xmath25 , equivalent to a total duration of @xmath26  hours ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hatnet ] ) .",
    "all hatnet candidates are subject to thorough investigation before using more precious time on large telescopes , such as keck i , to observe them .",
    "one of the important tools for establishing whether the transit - feature in the light curve of a candidate is due to astrophysical phenomena other than a planet transiting a star is the cfa digital speedometer ( ds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mounted on the  telescope .",
    "high - resolution spectra with low signal - to - noise ratio from this facility have been used routinely in the past to derive radial velocities with moderate precision ( roughly 1@xmath27 ) and to classify the effective temperature and surface gravity of the host star , to weed out false alarms , such as f dwarfs orbited by m dwarfs , grazing eclipsing binaries , triple and quadruple star systems , or giant stars where the transit signal is either false , or comes from a nearby , blended eclipsing binary .",
    "the rv measurements of hat - p-10 showed an rms residual of 0.43@xmath27 , consistent with no detectable rv variation .",
    "atmospheric parameters for the star , including the effective temperature @xmath28 , surface gravity @xmath29 , and projected rotational velocity @xmath30 , were derived as described by @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature and surface gravity corresponds to an early k dwarf .",
    "given the significant detection by hatnet , and the positive ds results that exclude the usual suspects , we proceeded with the follow - up of this candidate by obtaining high - resolution and high s / n spectra to characterize the radial velocity variations and to determine the stellar parameters with higher precision .",
    "we obtained 6 exposures with an iodine cell , plus one iodine - free template , using the hires instrument @xcite on the keck  i telescope located on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the observations were made on the nights of 2008 march 21 - 22 , july 27 and on three nights between september 13 and 17 .",
