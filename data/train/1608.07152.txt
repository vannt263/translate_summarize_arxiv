    "studies of cold atoms contribute to many different areas of physics .",
    "one example is the investigation of strongly interacting fermi gases in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer to bose - einstein condensation ( bcs - bec ) crossover using feshbach resonances @xcite , where fermions interact with an @xmath3-wave scattering length at ultracold temperatures .",
    "such a fermi system is an ideal simulator for dilute neutron matter , which exists in neutron stars , neutron - rich nuclei , and heavy ion collisions .",
    "when the equation of state ( eos ) of such interacting fermions is determined using cold atoms , it will provide information regarding many - body physics in dilute nuclear matter .",
    "one of the important parameters to characterize the low temperature properties of fermi systems is @xmath4 , which is temperature normalized according to the fermi temperature .",
    "it is advantageous to use light fermions with high density for the investigation of many - body physics at the zero - temperature limit because @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the mass of the fermion and the number density , respectively .",
    "however , there are some technical issues when we would like to observe such light and dense fermions confined in a small trap potential .",
    "one standard technique used to observe atomic density is absorption imaging @xcite .",
    "when a probe laser with intensity @xmath8 is applied to atoms along the @xmath9 direction , the probe intensity decreases according to the beer - lambert law : @xmath10 where @xmath1 and @xmath11 are respectively the absorption cross - section and saturation intensity , and it is assumed that the atoms maintain a resonant condition and constant density during measurement .",
    "here we define the incident and output probe intensities as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the saturation parameter as @xmath14 , the transmittance as @xmath15 , and the column density as @xmath16 .",
    "the column density is derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) as @xmath17 therefore , a set of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath1 is required to obtain a spatial distribution of the column density . in this paper , optical depth ( od )",
    "is defined as @xmath20 .",
    "it is straightforward to evaluate @xmath21 ; however , the beer - lambert law can be violated under inappropriate probe conditions . during irradiation with a probe pulse , atoms repeat cycles of absorption and spontaneous emission , whereby atoms accumulate velocity changes caused by photon recoils .",
    "this induces detuning of the probe laser due to the doppler shift and blurring induced by random walk .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 and @xmath1 often have values different from their theoretical values for various reasons , such as the line width and polarization of the probe laser , and stray light .    a weak probe pulse ( @xmath22 ) is typically applied to atoms with a short pulse duration to suppress the influence of the doppler shift and random walk . in this case ,",
    "od can be approximated by the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , and the value of @xmath11 does not have to be evaluated .",
    "however , this condition is not suitable for imaging a dense cloud with a large magnification , because a small number of photons per charge - coupled device ( ccd ) pixel gives a poor signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "imaging of a dense cloud of @xmath23rb with an intense probe pulse ( @xmath24 ) has been previously demonstrated  @xcite",
    ". however , the issues of doppler shift and random walk due to frequent photon recoils during the intense probe pulse irradiation were not discussed . while the influence of photon recoils is almost negligible for heavy atomic species such as @xmath23rb , it becomes significant for light @xmath0li due to a larger recoil velocity . @xmath11 and @xmath1 were also calibrated using a common calibration coefficient  @xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the accuracy of the calibration coefficient depends on the accuracy of determining the probe laser intensity applied to the atoms .",

    "an external cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) is used as the light source for the hf - image .",

    "this magnetic trap works mainly along the @xmath48 direction because the odt provides much stronger confinement than the magnetic trap along the @xmath54 and @xmath9 directions .",
