    "in the last decade , tests of the electroweak model at accelerators give indirect evidence that the standard model is the correct description of physics below 1 tev and that it contains a higgs boson with a mass not too far above current limits @xcite .",
    "the higgs boson itself has not been seen @xcite . assuming the standard model is correct for scattering energies beyond 1 tev , we know to reasonable precision the production cross section , decay width and branching ratios for any given higgs mass .",
    "thus search strategies can be optimized for such a higgs .",
    "however , higgs phenomenology can be very sensitive to physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the higgs width , at a mass of 115 gev , is about a thousandth of the @xmath1 boson width .",
    "therefore , if there were neutral particles lighter than half the higgs mass with any reasonable coupling to the higgs , then the higgs could decay dominantly into those particles , and the @xmath1 width would not necessarily be significantly affected . here",
    "we assume that a decay into a pair of new light scalars dominates the higgs width .",
    "the scalar , @xmath2 , subsequently decays to a pair of bottom quarks , producing the signal @xmath3 .",
    "such phenomenology has been discussed in the context of the nmssm @xcite and could also be possible in little higgs or composite higgs theories or any other such model where new light scalars ( or pseudo - scalars ) are coupled to the higgs .",
    "this signal has in fact been searched for at lep ii , with a bound on the mass of the higgs of 110 gev assuming a 100% branching ratio to the light scalars and assume the scalars always decay to a pair of @xmath0 quarks , with weaker bounds for smaller branching ratios @xcite .",
    "searches at hadron colliders are considered very difficult due to the large irreducible background from qcd production of 4 @xmath0 jets .",
    "it may be especially difficult at the atlas and cms experiments @xcite where triggers require high transverse momentum jets and/or leptons and thus the signal efficiency for what makes it to disk may be quite low .",
    "the strategy usually suggested is thus to look at higgs production in association with a @xmath4 boson decaying leptonically , even though the cross section is significantly lower than resonant production @xcite . in this note , we study the possibility of seeing the higgs decay to 4 bottom quarks at the lhcb experiment @xcite .",
    "its lower running luminosity allows for less stringent trigger requirements and its smaller solid angle coverage allows for a higher rate of events written to disk than other lhc experiments .",
    "we find that for @xmath2 masses below 20 gev there are simple kinematic cuts after which the signal approaches the size of the 4@xmath0 qcd background .",
    "for these lighter @xmath2 masses , one is required to find two @xmath0 decay vertices within a single cone , or two almost merged jets .",
    "the hope is that using non - standard vertexing techniques , such as topological vertexing @xcite one may be able to seed calorimeter clusters with secondary vertices themselves with a reasonable efficiency . in the next section",
    ", we estimate the total efficiency required , at different points in parameter space , to see evidence at 3 @xmath5 for such a signal after one year of running ( assuming 2 fb@xmath6 of data collected ) at lhcb . in principle , with the right triggers , atlas and cms may do as well or better than lhcb for this signal .",
    "we study lhcb because their planned inclusive muon trigger acts as an  existence proof \" that this data will be written to disk .",
    "also , in inclusive production , the higgs is typically produced with a significant boost along the beam at the lhc , and thus at least one @xmath0 quark often lives at large pseudo - rapidity , and therefore excellent tracking and vertexing in the forward region may be crucial for this signal . finally , the possibility of doing useful energy frontier physics studies at the lhcb experiment could complement the atlas and cms programs and should be explored . to mock up the large number of theories which contain this physics ,",
    "the ` model ' we are studying is simply the standard model with an additional real uncharged scalar @xmath2 .",
    "the new scalar can couple to the higgs doublet via , for example , @xmath7 after electroweak symmetry breaking , this term will generate a tree - level mass squared for @xmath2 of @xmath8 and the trilinear coupling @xmath9 , where @xmath10 gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "the cubic coupling allows ( for a light enough @xmath2 ) the higgs to decay into a pair of scalars , with a rate @xmath11 when compared to the total decay rate of a ( _ e.g. _ , 115 gev ) standard model higgs , we see that for the above partial width to dominate the higgs decay , the coupling to the scalar should be @xmath12 .",
    "if the physical mass of @xmath2 is nt a fine - tuned combination of different contributions ( _ i.e. _ , a cancellation to no less than 10% ) , then we should expect its mass to be above roughly 10 gev if it is to dominate the higgs width .",
    "the most natural way for the singlet to decay is in the same way as a standard model higgs boson of the same mass .",
    "this would occur if the singlet mixes with the higgs via a singlet vev or an operator @xmath13 .",
    "the singlet could also be higgs - like if it mixes with other higgs - like states .",
    "in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , a pseudo - scalar can be naturally light and mix with the heavier cp - odd part of the uneaten higgs doublet . in any case",
    ", even a tiny mixing of this type would allow a , say , 20 gev scalar a prompt decay rate , dominantly into @xmath14 .",
    "we study precisely this signal setting the cross section of higgs production to that of the standard model ( at leading order ) and the decay branching ratios of @xmath15 to unity .",
    "the significances we quote scale with these quantities , for fixed backgrounds . other decay options can be generated with additional new physics at the electroweak scale .",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "the signal we studied was higgs production with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "signal events were produced and showered using pythia v6.409 @xcite .",
    "our analysis was performed for a number of different masses for @xmath18 and @xmath2 .",
    "the study was done for @xmath19 at 115 , 130 and 145 gev with @xmath20 between 15 and 35 gev in 5 gev steps .",
    "pythia generates the signal at leading order plus showering . at this order ,",
    "the integrated cross - section for higgs production at lhc energies is @xmath21pb for @xmath22 gev , @xmath23pb for @xmath24 gev , and @xmath25pb for @xmath26 gev .",
    "next - to - leading - order and higher corrections add @xmath27% to this @xcite , though we do not include the enhancement as we also run the background at leading order .",
    "we assume branching ratios of unity for both the @xmath28 and @xmath17 decays .",
    "the background we include in this study is qcd production of four @xmath0 quarks . qcd 2@xmath0 production does not contribute significantly after double - counting of events is taken into account .",
    "background events were produced in alpgen v2.10 @xcite and then showered through pythia v6.325 .",
    "backgrounds not considered were those in which only three @xmath0 quarks or fewer are produced in the acceptance region ( important when a @xmath29 or light quark or gluon is mistagged as a @xmath0 quark ) . jets are partially merged .",
    "] we do not study these channels as their importance depends sensitively on mistag rates , and using estimates of jet mistagging at the tevatron suggests that these contributions will not dominate the background @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 qcd background is potentially more significant in the kinematic region where the pairs of @xmath0 jets from the individual scalar decays merge ( _ i.e. _ , when the scalars are light ) .",
    "qcd production of two @xmath0 jets will be enormous at the lhc , with a cross section on the order of 1 mb ",
    "roughly a factor of 1000 larger than 4@xmath0 production .",
    "thus the technique for tagging two merged @xmath0 jets better include a very small 1 @xmath0 to 2 @xmath0 fake rate ( less than a few percent ) .",
    "it is expected that signal and background events will pass the level zero ( l0 ) trigger at lhcb with high efficiency , while the recent upgrade of the lhcb read out rate to @xmath30 khz has permitted the addition of an inclusive high - level muon trigger",
    ". the inclusive branching ratio of @xmath0 hadrons to muons is @xmath31 , so given 4 @xmath0 s per event , there is a @xmath32 probability that a given event will see the decay of at least one @xmath0 hadron to a muon .",
    "the @xmath0 s from signal events are expected to be fairly hard for the forward acceptance range of lhcb @xmath33 ( @xmath34 @xmath35 gev ) given the large invariant mass of the higgs boson , so it seems reasonable to assume that @xmath36 of these muon decays will be triggered on .",
    "this trigger path by itself therefore gives an expected trigger efficiency of order or better than @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "other high - level triggers which are already in place or could be designed for this purpose may increase this efficiency significantly and are worthy of study . to avoid generic qcd backgrounds",
    ", we require the tagging of all four @xmath0 quarks . however , rather than first reconstructing jets and then applying a b - tag ( the usual method ) , we assume the four @xmath0 vertices are found first using a method such as topological vertexing @xcite .",
    "then , the @xmath0-hadrons are used as seeds of jets with cone - size @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the spread in pseudo rapidity and azimuthal angle ) .",
    "when the jets overlap , we divide up the momenta of particles in the overlapping region between the two jets based on a smooth function of distance from the seeds , though in practice this detail is unimportant ; pairs of overlapping jets are reconstructed into scalars , and only information about these reconstructed scalars is used as a kinematic discriminant . as a rough approximation , we take the triggering and tagging efficiencies as equal for signal and background and independent of kinematic configuration . we define @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the significance , @xmath43 is the efficiency to tag all four @xmath0 jets , @xmath44 is the trigger efficiency and @xmath45 is the significance ( described below ) assuming @xmath46 .",
    "our results are described as an estimate the efficiencies required to generate a significance @xmath42 of @xmath47 .    beyond @xmath0-tagging , we require all @xmath0 jets to have @xmath48 gev , and of course for all of them to live within the detector acceptance .",
    "lhcb s nominal acceptance range in pseudorapidity @xmath49 on the vertical axis and @xmath50 on the horizontal axis .",
    "once these four @xmath0 jets have been reconstructed , there are three possible ways to combine them into two pairs of jets in order to reconstruct the two @xmath2 particles . requiring the two pairs to have the same invariant mass within detector resolution turns out not to be a useful discriminant .",
    "the combination which is chosen is that which minimizes the quantity @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the previously - defined distance in @xmath53-@xmath54 space between the first pair of jets and @xmath55 is the distance between the second pair .",
    "it should be noted that this technique limits us to the study of relatively light scalars whose decay products tend to be collimated .",
    "our method chooses the correct combination of jets @xmath56% of the time for all the previously mentioned sets of parameters other than with @xmath24 gev , @xmath57 gev and @xmath22 gev , @xmath57 gev where the proper combination was recreated @xmath58% and @xmath59% of the time , respectively .",
    "for scalar masses closer to the upper kinematic limit ( @xmath60 ) it is possible to recreate the proper jet combination moderately well ( up to @xmath61% when @xmath62 ) by choosing the combination which maximizes @xmath51 .",
    "unfortunately , this method does not significantly reduce the background once an overall invariant mass cut is placed on the four jets .    from each event , we have therefore reconstructed a higgs mass and two @xmath2 masses .",
    "the mean of these two @xmath2 masses is taken as the @xmath2 mass in all further analyses .",
    "when @xmath63 is plotted against @xmath64 as in figure  [ fig : scatterplot ] signal events generated by different sets of parameters tend to group into elongated ellipses .",
    "events generated with a lower @xmath64 tend to be more tightly grouped than those with a higher mass , but the slope of the long axis of the ellipse seems to be independent of the location in parameter space and is @xmath65 .",
    "see the appendix for details . this spread in invariant masses is a result of the jet ( cone ) algorithm we have chosen but does not take into account general smearing due to detector effects .",
    "it would be interesting to see if a nearly constant slope is maintained in a full simulation .",
    "the fact that this slope is fairly constant across parameter space allows us to perform the following transformation : @xmath66 the resulting quantities @xmath67 and",
    "@xmath68 are therefore roughly uncorrelated for a set of signal events from any point in a large region of parameter space .",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath67 for such a set is of the order of @xmath69 gev , while that of @xmath68 is of the order of @xmath70 gev .",
    ".efficiency required , @xmath71 to see a @xmath47 significance with 2 fb@xmath6 of data for various values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 along with the point ( in @xmath68 and @xmath67 ) at which the greatest significance is seen .",
    "the ratio of signal to background , @xmath72 , included in this significance is also provided .",
