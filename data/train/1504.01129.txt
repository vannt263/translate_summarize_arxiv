    "since the temporal property of the large - scale magnetic field also changes from the oscillatory to the stationary across @xmath2 as was described in  3.4 , this suggests that the dynamo mechanism would be associated in some way with the kinetic helicity in the convection zone .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the net kinetic helicity , which shows a peak at moderate rotation rate , is deeply related to the formation of the convective column .",
    "since the angular velocity is lower in the regime of the anti - solar type dr or @xmath125 , the up - down asymmetry of the convective motion is lower , leading to less preference for one sign of the kinetic helicity . on the other hand , in the regime of the solar - type dr or @xmath124 ,",

    ".    it would be trivial that the kinetic helicity has an antisymmetric profile with respect to the equator in the model with a sufficiently fast rotation . in the northern ( southern ) hemisphere , the negative ( positive ) helicity",
    "becomes predominant .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the weaker equatorial antisymmetry of the kinetic helicity profile in the model with the smallest rotation ( mr00625 ) would be a result of a weaker coriolis force which provides less impact on the convective motion .",
    "the peak amplitude of the kinetic helicity is little dependent on the rotation rate ( within factor 2 ) .",
    "however , we can find from figure 12 that the latitude for the peak of the kinetic helicity decreases as the rotation rate increases : while the higher latitudinal region has a larger helicity in the models with the anti - solar type dr ( mr00625 , 025 , and 030 ) , the lower latitudinal region has a larger helicity in the models with the solar - type dr ( mr050 , 060 , and 150 ) .",
    "it is the most remarkable that both the hemispheric and inter - hemispheric latitudinal gradients of the kinetic helicity become larger around the equator with the increase of the rotation rate . in the models with the solar - type dr and the oscillatory large - scale magnetic field , the kinetic helicity concentrates on around the equatorial plane and has strong hemispheric and inter - hemispheric latitudinal gradients there .",
    "in contrast , the models with the anti - solar type dr and the stationary large - scale magnetic field do not show the significant latitudinal gradient of the kinetic helicity around the equatorial region .",
    "since , when comparing figures 9 and 11 , the latitude providing the stronger large - scale magnetic field overlaps with that with the larger kinetic helicity , it is expected that the latitudinal distribution of the kinetic helicity is a key to distinguish the dynamo mechanisms .",
    "the larger the latitudinal gradient of the kinetic helicity around the equator becomes , the more the oscillatory large - scale magnetic field would be developed .",
    "recently , @xcite reported an intriguing finding in their dynamo simulation by a forced helical turbulence in a wedge - shaped spherical shell that the oscillatory large - scale magnetic field with equatorial migration can be organized , even without the @xmath3-effect , essentially due to an inter - hemispheric gradient of the kinetic helicity .",
    "they argued that the @xmath130-dynamo mode excited by the helical turbulence with the equatorial antisymmetry is responsible for the oscillatory property .",

    "when considering the latitudinal gradient of the kinetic helicity around the equator as an important ingredient of the oscillatory property of the dynamo even in our simulations , we can speculate the reason why there exists a difference of the dynamo property depending on the regime of the rotation profile .",
    "since the model with the smaller rotation rate and thus the anti - solar type dr does not have a sufficient latitudinal gradient of the kinetic helicity around the equator to excite the oscillatory @xmath130-dynamo mode , the @xmath3-effect solely works to build up the large - scale magnetic field and thus yields a stationary solution .",
    "in contrast , the model with the faster rotation and thus the solar - type dr has a sufficient concentration and strong latitudinal gradient of the kinetic helicity around the equator , yielding the oscillatory large - scale magnetic component sustained by the @xmath130-effect in addition to the @xmath3-effect .",
    "the detailed analysis with mode expansion by legendre polynomials on kinetic helicity and magnetic field will be presented in a subsequent paper in which we focus on the magnetic dynamo activity and its dependences on the rotation rate and stratification level .",
    "although a quantitative description of the dynamo mechanism is beyond the scope of this paper , we can speculate from our simulation results that accurate numerical modeling of the kinetic helicity profile in the actual solar interior will offer a way to unveil the mystery of the solar magnetism .",
    "in this paper , the effect of the magnetic field on the mean dr profile established in the convection zone was systematically studied by comparing the mhd and hd models of the rotating spherical shell convection in the broad range of the initial rotation rate .",

    "the magnetic field had a crucial role in suppressing the dr and facilitated to produce the solar - type rotation profile . since the lorentz force of the dynamo - generated magnetic field reduced the convective velocity ,",
    "the mhd model became more rotationally - constrained than the hd model .",
    "this would be the reason why the magnetic field facilitated to produce the solar - type dr .",
    "the transition from the solar to anti - solar type rotation profiles occurred at @xmath99 both in the mhd and hd models .",

    "<S> effects of magnetic field on stellar differential rotation are studied by comparing magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models and their hydrodynamic ( hd ) counterparts in the broad range of rotation rate and in varying initial rotation profile . </S>",
    "<S> fully - compressible mhd simulations of rotating penetrative convection are performed in a full - spherical shell geometry . </S>",
    "<S> critical conditions for the transition of the differential rotation between faster equator ( solar - type ) and slower equator ( anti - solar type ) are explored with focusing on the  rossby number ( @xmath0 ) \" and the  convective rossby number ( @xmath1 ) \" . </S>",
    "<S> it is confirmed that the transition is more gradual and the critical value for it is higher in the mhd model than the hd model in the view of the @xmath1-dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation profile shows , as observed in earlier studies , the bistability near the transition in the hd model , while it disappears when allowing the growth of magnetic fields except for the model with taking anti - solar type solution as the initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the transition occurs at @xmath2 both in the mhd and hd models independently of the hysteresis . </S>",
    "<S> not only the critical value , the sharpness of the transition is also similar between the two models in the view of the @xmath0-dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the influences of the dynamo - generated magnetic field and/or the hysteresis on convective motion are reflected in the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this would be the reason why the transition is unified in the view of the @xmath0-dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we finally discuss the @xmath0-dependence of magnetic dynamo activities with emphasis on its possible relation to the kinetic helicity profile . </S>"
