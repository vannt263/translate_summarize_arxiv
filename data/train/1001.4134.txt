    "coherent control of atomic and molecular processes is a subject of considerable ongoing interest@xcite . specifically , a number of successful control scenarios have been theoretically proposed and experimentally implemented . the vast majority of well characterized scenarios are , however , based upon molecules treated in isolation , with the understanding that systems in an external environment are subject to decoherence effects@xcite that can be deleterious to control@xcite .",
    "decoherence effects of this kind are also detrimental to  quantum technologies \" , such as quantum information processing and quantum computing@xcite insofar as they cause the loss of the essential quantum characteristics that make these research areas interesting .    as a consequence",
    ", efforts are ongoing to find suitable mechanisms to reduce or compensate for decoherence effects .",
    "for example , several techniques , such as quantum dynamical decoupling ( qdd ) @xcite and the use of decoherence free subspace ( dfs ) @xcite , have been proposed in the quantum information community .",
    "however , the qdd method is quite challenging to implement using the present technology , and the dfs requires explicit symmetries in the hamiltonian , which are not generic .",
    "hence , methods for identifying conditions for states that are resistant to decoherence is of great interest .    indeed , considerable effort has gone into identifying characteristic features of particular system states , interacting with different environments , that lead to stability against decoherence .",
    "sample approaches include the general predictability sieve approach of zurek _ _ e__t al .",
    "@xcite , and predictions of the unusual stability of coherent matter states , low lying eigenstates , and localized states @xcite for typical environmental coupling .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new perspective , based on overlapping resonances , to understanding and optimize the resistance of system superposition states to decoherence .",
    "the approach applies in the important regime where system - environment coupling is large .",
    "specifically , we show that interference between the overlapping resonances that exist in this regime can be used to build system superposition states that are relatively resistant to decoherence . the extent to which such states are stable against decoherence",
    "is shown to directly correlate with the degree to which the system - environment hamiltonian displays overlapping resonances .",
    "thus , even if the system does not possess symmetry properties such as decoherence free subspaces ( dfs ) , states can be constructed which are more resistant to decoherence than are others .    from a formal viewpoint ,",
    "the approach described herein constitutes a major extension , to product hilbert spaces characteristic of open quantum systems , of our work on controlling radiationless transitions in large molecules @xcite . there , population transfer between a @xmath0-subspace and the remainder of the hilbert space , the @xmath1-subspace , was minimized by preparing initial superpositions in the @xmath2-subspace , relying on the presence of overlapping resonances .",
    "this approach was applicable to the case where the full hilbert space was partitioned into the _ sum _ of two subspaces .",
    "by contrast , decoherence involves the effect of an environment on the system , i.e. _ a product _ of two hilbert spaces .",
    "the difference is substantial and significant .",
    "the inter - relationship between overlapping resonances and the ability to design states that are resistant to decoherence is general .",
    "it proves useful , however , to introduce the approach via a specific generic example . for this reason",
    "we choose a particular class of spin - boson problems .",
    "note that system decoherence is a manifestation of the loss of quantum information when one neglects the environment with which the system is entangled@xcite .",
    "as such , decoherence can occur effectively even with a small environment@xcite as is manifest in the example below .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a generic system that describes a spin system interacting with a environment , providing a specific example for this general approach .",
    "section iii , considers the nature of decoherence in this system , and its relationship to overlapping resonance .",
    "some specific numerical examples are provided in sect .",
    "iv to demonstrate correlations between overlapping resonances and reduced state decoherence .",
    "v provides a summary .",
    "the spin - boson problem has been extensively studied in chemistry in various scenarios and for a wide variety of applications@xcite .",
    "here we consider , as a specific example , the control of decoherence in a simple spin system interacting with a small thermal environment , i.e. a single spin - half system and an environment comprising a single - mode oscillator .",
    "the most general system - environment hamiltonian for this case is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the environment annihilation and creation operators , @xmath6 is the frequency of the environment mode , @xmath7 is the energy difference between the two spin - half states @xmath8 , and the spin operators are defined as @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "note that the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) has not been invoked : the @xmath11 term in the hamiltonian is the spin - environment interaction that is retained under the rwa , whereas the @xmath12 term is that which would be neglected in the rwa .",
    "the @xmath13 term corresponds to decoherence of the spin due to the operator @xmath14 , which induces a relative phase between the spin states @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 terms mediate energy exchange between the spin and the environment .",
    "our focus below is in the region of strong coupling , where @xmath12 and @xmath11 are both greater than @xmath17 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , although the environment is small ( a single oscillator ) its coupling to the system does induce significant system decoherence .    the class of hamiltonians [ eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) ] possesses a plane defined by @xmath18 in the three dimensional @xmath19 parameter space upon which the system displays a decoherence free subspace ( dfs ) .",
    "that is , in these special cases the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) leads to a dfs due to a lie algebraic symmetry .",
    "in these cases , the interaction part of the total hamiltonian can be written as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the environment operator , and the spin operator @xmath22 can be written in a closed matrix form in the @xmath23 spin basis : @xmath24 the dfs corresponds to the eigenstates of the @xmath22 matrix . for other values of @xmath12 and @xmath11 , of primary interest here , the system does not have a dfs .",
    "we consider the stability against decoherence of an initial spin superposition state @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are complex amplitudes and the environment is in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath27 .",
    "the latter is described in terms of the oscillator eigenstates @xmath28 by the environment density matrix @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in order to follow the temporal evolution of the system",
    "we expand the total ( system+environment ) evolution operator @xmath32 in terms of @xmath33 the eigenstates of the full hamiltonian [ i.e. , @xmath34 . expanding the eigenstates @xmath35 in the zeroth order basis of  bare \" spin+environment states @xmath36 ( i.e. the eigenstates of @xmath37 without the spin - environment interaction ) gives , for the time - evolved density matrix of the total spin+environment system : @xmath38u^\\dag=\\sum_{\\gamma,\\gamma',n}p_ne^{-i(e_\\gamma - e_{\\gamma'})t}|\\gamma\\rangle\\langle \\gamma'|\\langle \\gamma|\\psi , n\\rangle\\langle \\psi , n|\\gamma'\\rangle\\;.\\ ] ] further , tracing over the environment states ,",
    "gives the following reduced system density matrix elements @xmath39 in the basis of spin states @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 denote either the plus or minus state : @xmath43 expanding @xmath44 as @xmath45 , we can rewrite the above expression as @xmath46 where @xmath47,@xmath48,@xmath49,@xmath50 are complex matrices with elements @xmath51    consider the decoherence of the spin state , quantified in terms of the purity @xcite @xmath52 of the spin , where @xmath53 . given the above results , @xmath52 can be evaluated via @xmath54 so that , using @xmath55 : @xmath56\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2 { \\rm re } \\left[\\sum_{k , l\\in + , -}\\left[c_+^2c_-^{*2}p_{kl}p_{lk } + |c_+|^2c_+^*c_-[q_{kl}p_{kl}^*+p_{lk}^*q_{kl}^ * ] + |c_-|^2c_+^*c_-[r_{kl}p_{kl}^*+p_{lk}^*r_{kl}^*]\\right]\\right ] . \\label{mix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first three of these terms depend solely on the magnitude of the @xmath57 coefficients , whereas the remainder of the terms depend upon the phases of the coefficients as well .",
    "the latter are clearly contributions to @xmath52 that rely upon quantum interference between the spin states .",
    "note , for comparison later below , that @xmath58 denotes a pure state .",
    "if the state is completely decohered in the spin basis then @xmath59 so that the purity , by eq . ( [ purity ] ) , is @xmath60 .    with the @xmath61 matrices known , one can optimize @xmath52 with respect to @xmath62 and @xmath63 to determine the state with maximum purity @xmath52 at a fixed time .",
    "in particular , the relative phase of @xmath62 and @xmath63 is important if either @xmath64 or @xmath65 is non - zero , and @xmath66 is non - zero . although not evident from eq .",
    "( [ mix ] ) , numerical results below clearly demonstrate a reliance on this relative phase to maximize @xmath52 .",
    "as noted above , the bare states @xmath67 are not eigenstates of @xmath37 , and will evolve in the presence of the system - environment coupling .",
    "insight into the nature of this time evolution is afforded by expanding the zeroth order state in the exact eigenstates @xmath35 .",
    "for example , a bare state such as @xmath68 expands as @xmath69 and evolves as @xmath70 the @xmath71 dependence of the square of the expansion coefficient , i.e. @xmath72 provides the energy width over which the zeroth order state @xmath68 is spread due to the system - environment interaction . in the simplest cases",
    "the inverse of this width provides a qualitative measure of the time scale for the evolution of @xmath68 .",
    "hence , the zero order states are indeed resonances with a characteristic width @xmath73 .",
    "this is the analog , in a bound state spectrum , of the well known resonance in the continuum .",
    "similarly , by analogy to the continuum case , we can define _ overlapping resonances _ , as resonances that overlap in energy space , i.e. resonances that share a common @xmath35 in their respective eigenstate expansions .",
    "these are the precise bound state analogues to overlapping resonances in the continuum [ e.g. fig 1 , ref .",
    "examples of bound state overlapping resonances in molecular systems have also been previously reported@xcite .    in the case of the spin - boson hamiltonians given by eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) , overlapping resonances were clearly evident in , but not limited to , the strong coupling regime characterized by @xmath11 and @xmath12 greater than @xmath17 .",
    "they occur as two states @xmath74 and @xmath75 with @xmath76 and/or @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) that have non - zero overlap with the same eigenstate @xmath35 .",
    "examples of such overlapping resonances are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : overlapping ] .",
    "quite clearly the overlap between the resonances can be significant , enhanced by the fact that the overall width of each resonances can be significantly larger than the energy spacing between the zeroth order states .",
    "the resonances are also seen to be rather highly structured .",
    "+   +   +      consider then the role of these overlapping resonances in the dynamical evolution of @xmath80 given in eq .",
    "( [ timeevolution ] ) .",
    "specifically , note that all the matrices @xmath47,@xmath48,@xmath49,@xmath50 depend on overlapping resonance contributions .",
    "their dependences differ , however , in the important case where @xmath81 . in that case",
    "overlapping resonances contribute to @xmath82 and @xmath66 , but not to @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "that is , the terms in @xmath39 that are sensitive to the relative phase of @xmath62 and @xmath63 [ see eq .",
    "( [ timeevolution ] ) ] , and are hence associated with phase control over the dynamics , are directly dependent on overlapping resonances contributions .",
    "> from eq .",
    "( [ mix ] ) , it is apparent that the purity is strongly affected by overlapping resonances through the matrix elements @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath82 . to quantify this dependence , we explicitly identify overlapping resonances contributions associated with the plus and minus spin states .",
    "that is , we define @xmath83\\;.\\ ] ] for a pair of the oscillator states @xmath84 and @xmath28 , @xmath85 determines the overlap ( summed over all eigenstates @xmath35 ) between the bare states @xmath86 and @xmath87 , when the spin state is @xmath15 .",
    "if , for the same pair of @xmath84 and @xmath28 , there exists non - zero overlap @xmath88 between the bare state @xmath89 and @xmath90 , then @xmath91 provides a measure of the overlap between states @xmath15 and @xmath16 , that arises through the overlap between states @xmath92 and @xmath67 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ overlap ] ) is somewhat similar to the off diagonal @xmath93 and @xmath94 terms at @xmath95 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     note that the number and character of the overlapping resonances are functions of the parameters in the total hamiltonian , e.g. , here @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath6 , and @xmath17 .",
    "for example , in the extreme case where there is no system - environment coupling ( i.e. @xmath96 ) , the total hamiltonian is diagonal in the spin - boson bare state basis .",
    "the overlap between the spin - boson bare states then vanishes , and in turn , so does the overlap between the states @xmath8 .",
    "that is , as expected , in absence the system of coupling to the environment , the spin states are not broadened and thus do not overlap .",
    "consider then the relationship between overlapping resonances as reflected in @xmath91 and decoherence as embodied in the system purity @xmath52 .",
    "as an example , we examine dynamics where the environment temperature t = 25 mk and choose to vary @xmath11 , keeping the other hamiltonian parameters fixed .    numerical results",

    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ oldfigure1 ] where both @xmath102 and the overlapping resonance measure @xmath91 are plotted as a function of @xmath11 at @xmath103 ns .",
    "the correspondence between the behavior of these two functions is evident , with larger @xmath91 correlating well with larger @xmath100 .",
    "that is , the greater the overlapping resonances contribution , the more resistant is the optimal superposition to decoherence .",
    "note , significantly , that the optimally resistant state need not be , and is often not , an eigenstate of the spin hamiltonian , but is rather a superposition of @xmath15 and @xmath16 eigenstates .",
    "prominent in the graph ( and some presented below ) is the dfs point @xmath18 , where the @xmath91 curve displays a sharp peak , commensurate with @xmath102 reaching its maximum value of unity .",
    "that is , maximal purity clearly correlates with the maximum @xmath91 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath102 from unity as one moves away from this point is significant , particularly in scenarios such as quantum computation , where extremely high degrees of coherence are necessary .",
    "the results clearly show that states take advantage of overlapping resonances ( and hence of quantum interference ) to increase the state purity .",

    "we have introduced a new unifying approach to considering the resistance to decoherence of system superposition states .",
