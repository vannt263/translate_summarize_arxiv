    "the de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) effect is perhaps the most significant of the quantum oscillatory phenomena in metals ; as the magnetization @xmath0 is a thermodynamic state function , it can be directly related to the density of states and fermi - dirac distribution of electrons in a metal . in order to measure this effect",
    ", one observes the oscillatory magnetization with swept field of an electrically conducting single crystal at a low temperature and high - magnetic field .",
    "in the course of measuring the fermi surfaces of the elements , copper , silver , and gold oscillations came late because both higher fields and better samples were required@xcite .",
    "the large spheres of their fermi surfaces barely touch each other in reciprocal space and in turn give rise to closely spaced belly oscillations .",
    "although the periods seemed correct , the oscillations were distorted by harmonic content .",
    "an explanation was provided by shoenberg and pippard who realized that if the magnetization @xmath1 was swinging by more than the period of the oscillation , the internal field _",
    "b _ = _ h _",
    "+ 4@xmath2 must be used to modify the oscillatory equation to obtain @xcite @xmath3 where the variables are as in shoenberg@xcite .",
    "this description seemed to be in favorable agreement with experiment , and then pippard realized that the effective free energy became multi - valued at high enough fields@xcite .",
    "consequently , this result leads to coexisting phases as in the pressure - volume isotherms in gas - liquid phase equilibria , and in the case of silver , it is condon domains with slightly different magnetizations .",
    "nmr experiments indicated that such domains differ , for example , by about a mt at 9 t. this observation led to the name condon domains@xcite .",
    "motivated by recent review articles on this subject@xcite , we describe the thesis work of one of the authors ( jls ) under the direction of george seidel@xcite .",
    "k. the inset , typical trace is at 0.10 k , 80 @xmath4t / s sweep , and 0.33 @xmath4t@xmath5 modulation .",
    "the modulation frequencies were 24 hz.,height=240 ]    the home - built dilution refrigerator was capable of 20 mk in an 8 t superconducting magnet , which had a homogeneity of one part in 10@xmath6 over a 25 mm sphere .",
    "for this field - modulation measurement a sample holder was used that rotated in two directions .",
    "the silver single crystal was cut into a shape approximating an ellipsoid with principal axes lengths of 11 mm , 4.6 mm , and 0.61 mm , which were the @xmath7100@xmath8 directions of the sample .",
    "the measurements described here are only for the orientation of the long axis 13.5@xmath9 away from the field direction and in a @xmath7100@xmath8 plane , which yields a single dhva oscillation from the belly of the sphere of the fermi surface .",
    "the results for the @xmath7100@xmath8 orientation , which has two orbits , are covered in detail elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the crystal had a residual resistivity ratio of 660 and a dingle temperature of 0.8 k.",
    "in the situation under investigation we show a rate - dependent hysteresis effect in fig .",
    "the evolution of the signal amplitude divided by the modulation level is shown over four decades of modulation levels .",
    "the amplitude for different sweep rates , ranging from 5 @xmath4t / s to 320 @xmath4t / s , show similar hysteretic behavior .",
    "one can see the existence of the van der waals field - induction diagram for condon domains , a topic covered in detail by gordon and coworkers@xcite . if no nonlinearities were present , all of the data would collapse to one horizontal line . in ref .",
    "this was explained as likely due to domain - wall pinning , which was described as an _ ad hoc _ model@xcite .",
    "now it is clear that the domain state must result from a first - order phase transition and that the nonlinearities arise from the hysteresis of forming and moving the domains .",
    "because the domains are formed and moved , it is reasonable to draw parallels between pressure or magnetization versus volume or field work , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "the discontinuous appearance in the dhva data is similar to experimental pressure - volume isotherms observed in gas - liquid phase equilibria .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "2 illustrate magnetic work and pressure - volume work . at the discontinuity",
    "there is a similarity to the double - valued response of the amplitude with the applied external field .",
    "the derivatives are plotted in fig . 2 to illustrate the rate dependence of the data .",
    "in general we observe the maximum value of the derivative with the lowest modulation level . in many respects",
    "this is similar to measuring the height of the specific - heat peak through a first - order transition@xcite .",
    "generally one will take small increments of temperature to obtain the total height of the transition .",
    "we conclude that the nonlinear dhva effect can be used as a tool to unambiguously identify a first - order transition . the multi - valued amplitude as a function of field is a hallmark of the hysteresis , and we speculate that the dampening of the amplitude is related to the latent heat as observed independently in specific - heat measurements@xcite .",
    "when this work was underway , mara elena de la cruz , as a postdoc , was instrumental to its completion .",
    "her husband paco , a postdoc with manuel cardona across the hall , simply could not keep away from that work .",
    "so mara elena and paco were crucial to making the work described here possible and have never been forgotten .",
    "this work was supported by nsf , darpa , and the u.s . dept . of energy ."
