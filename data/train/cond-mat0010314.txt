    "the nature of the interlayer coupling between two adjacent cuo@xmath4 planes in the cuprates is an important issue that remains unresolved .",

    "by contrast for impurity - mediated incoherent coupling , the in - plane momentum is not constraint .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath0-axis conductivity sum rule depends on the nature of interlayer coupling.@xcite coherent coupling obeys the conventional sum rule@xcite regardless of the angular dependence of the interlayer hopping amplitude .",
    "on the other hand , incoherent coupling violates the sum rule even if the in - plane dynamics can be described by a fermi liquid .",

    "a method for observing the quasiparticle current is to measure the hysteretic @xmath0-axis tunneling current - voltage characteristics of layered cuprates.@xcite for measurements of the optical conductivity which includes the pair tunneling , see ref.@xcite for coherent coupling with a constant hopping amplitude @xmath1 , the @xmath0-axis quasiparticle conductivity @xmath8 shows a residual value independent of the in - plane scattering rate @xmath9 ( gap ) to leading order @xcite with the correction @xmath10 .",
    "the underlying physics in this case is the same as for the in - plane quasiparticle conductivity;@xcite namely , the impurity - induced density of states at @xmath11 is canceled by the decrease of quasiparticle lifetime .",
    "a universal value has been observed in yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath12 for the in - plane thermal conductivity.@xcite in some sense the thermal conductivity is an ideal probe of universal behavior since , as opposed to the electrical conductivity , it is not renormalized by vertex and by fermi - liquid corrections,@xcite and so there is less ambiguity in its identification .",
