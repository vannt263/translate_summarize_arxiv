    "the so - called relativistic theory of gravity ( rtg ) , which was inspired by a.a .",
    "logunov with co - authors @xcite , is the alternative to einstein s general theory of relativity ( gr ) and differs from it in the cardinal point : the gravitation is considered as the tensor field of the faraday - maxwell s type in the flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "the existence of the flat reference background metric in rtg allows of the unambiguity and clarity of the obtained solutions , which are similar to ones in gr but to have the property of the trivial extendibility and topological simplicity .",
    "the lasts exclude the existence of the singularity , black holes , wormholes , topological defects etc . the structure of the theory is tougher due to existence of the additional field equation on background metric , which is analog of the harmonic coordinate equation in gr and",
    "is introduced in order to exclude the spins 1 and 0 for gravitons .",
    "the additional advantages of rtg are the existence of the conservation lows and the possibility of the canonical quantization .",
    "all experimental consequences of rtg are the same as ones in gr for experiments in solar system . but",
    "derived in @xcite cosmological scenario differs essentially : rtg permits only flat global spacetime universe , critical density of the matter and recollapse of universe in the case of nonzero mass of graviton .",
    "the predictions of the universe s flatness as well as the absence of the cosmological singularity in the case of nonzero mass of graviton are the advantages of the theory .",
    "but the decelerated character of the cosmological expansion and critical density of matter do nt agree with the modern observational data .",
    "the modern estimations of the basic cosmological parameters are presented in the table 1 ( @xmath1 is the hubble constant in _ _ km s__@xmath2 _ _ mps__@xmath2 , _ _ @xmath3__@xmath4 are the normalized density parameters for the curvature , matter and cosmological constant , respectively , @xmath5 is the minimal estimation of the universe s age corresponding to age of oldest globular clusters in _ gyr _ , @xmath6 is the parameter of the equation of state for the dominant energy ( see below ) ) .",

    "the introducing of the @xmath7-term in the lagrangian of rtg demands @xmath8 that contributes to the deceleration of the universe s expansion . however , modern observations suggest the accelerated expansion at the present epoch .",
    "we showed that without modification of the field equation @xcite the insertion of x - matter with the equation of the state , which is close to the extremal weak energy condition @xmath9 extends the class of the cosmological models in framework of rtg .",
    "as result , there exist the cosmological scenarios , which agree with the observational data . we demonstrated , that in the case of @xmath10 and @xmath11 the minimal size of the universe , its age and acceleration at the present epoch do nt contradict with the models considered in the framework of gr .",
    "but the existing data do nt allow to choose between different scenarios because the similar present behavior results in the essential difference in the future : eternal expansion for @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 ) , and recollapse for @xmath14 . moreover , the evolution , as rule , behaves the complicated loitering character with alternation of the acceleration and deceleration . that demands the additional investigations in this direction , especially , the search of rtg consequences for the universe s structure formation .",
    "this work was carried out by the use of the computer algebra system maple 6 .",
    "we suppose , that the algorithmization of the rtg basics can stimulate the investigations in this direction .",
    "the corresponding commented program can be found and downloaded on @xcite ."
