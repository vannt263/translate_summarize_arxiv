    "the fireball model has been extensively employed to explain the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) phenomenon ( mszros 2002 ; zhang & mszros 2004 ; piran 2004 ) .",
    "the observed prompt gamma - ray emission is explained by synchrotron ( or inverse compton ) emission from the internal shocks in an erratic , unsteady , relativistic fireball ( rees & mszros 1994 ) , and broadband afterglow emission is attributed to synchrotron emission from the external shock when the fireball is decelerated by a circum - burst medium ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "1998 ) . in order to avoid the  compactness problem \" of high energy non - thermal photons detected from grbs",
    ", the grb fireball is required to move relativistically towards earth .",
    "after the initial radiation - dominated acceleration phase , the fireball enters the matter - dominated  coasting \" phase .",
    "the fireball keeps an approximately same lorentz factor until it sweeps up a considerable amount mass from the ambient medium at the so - called deceleration radius , after which @xmath15 decreases with @xmath16 ( and the observer time @xmath17 ) as a power law .",
    "the factor lorentz factor during the coasting phase is called the initial lorentz factor ( @xmath11 ) , which is a crucial parameter to understand grb physics , but is poorly known for most grbs .",
    "three methods have been proposed to measure the initial lorentz factor @xmath11 .",
    "the first method is to apply the  compactness \" argument to use the high energy photon cutoff energy in the grb prompt emission spectrum to estimate @xmath11 .",
    "since so far no clear cutoff feature is observed , the common practice is to use the observed maximum photon energy to set a lower limit on @xmath11 ( fenimore et al .",
    "1993 ; woods & loeb 1995 ; baring & harding 1997 ; lithwick & sari 2001 ) .",
    "this method suffers several uncertainties .",
    "first , the cutoff energy depends on both @xmath11 and the emission radius @xmath18 ( gupta & zhang 2008 ) .",
    "the method therefore relies on the assumption of @xmath19 , the internal shock radius . such an assumption is not necessarily correct .",
    "second , the minimum variability time scale @xmath20 is subject to large uncertainty , since the grb lightcurves are chaotic and do not have a characteristic time scale .",
    "finally , fermi observations ( abdo et al . 2009b , c ) indicate that some grbs have a distinct high energy component in the gev range , which may come from a different emission region .",
    "a straightforward usage of the method may lead to erroneous conclusions .",
    "the second method to measure @xmath11 is to use the blackbody component detected in some grb spectra ( peer et al .",
    "the limitation of the method is the difficulty of identifying blackbody components from the grb spectra .",
    "so far the only case that this method is securely applied is grb 090902b ( ryde et al .",
    "the third , but most commonly adopted , method is to use the early afterglow lightcurve .",
    "the fireball model predicts that at the onset of deceleration , the emission from the forward shock would display a smooth bump in the lightcurve , the peak of which corresponds to the epoch when essentially half of the fireball energy is transferred to the medium ( sari & piran 1999 ; kobayashi & zhang 2007 ) .",
    "the most relevant case is the thin shell regime , defined by that the thickness of the fireball shell satisfies @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the kinetic energy of the fireball , @xmath23 is the medium density , @xmath24 the mass of proton , @xmath25 speed of light ( kobayashi et al . 1999 ; sari & piran 1999 ) . within this regime , the deceleration time ( the peak time at the lightcurve bump , @xmath26 , mszros & rees 1993 ) is sensitive depends on the initial lorentz factor but insensitive to other parameters .",
    "the detection of this time can be then used to infer @xmath11 . in the optical band",
    ", early emission may be contaminated by the emission from the reverse shock ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari & piran 1999 ; kobayashi 2000 ; zhang et al .",
    "however , under certain conditions ( either a poynting flux dominated flow , zhang & kobayashi 2005 ; or a relatively low typical synchrotron frequency in the reverse shock , jin & fan 2007 ) , the reverse shock component would not show up in the optical band . in these bursts ,",
    "a smooth onset bump can be detected , which signals the deceleration feature of the fireball , and hence , can be used to constrain the initial lorentz factor and the deceleration radius ( sari  piran 1999 , zhang et al .",
    "2003 ; molinari et al .",
    "2007 ; xue et al . 2009 ; zou & piran 2009 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we constrain @xmath11 with the early grb afterglows that show the deceleration signature , and investigate the possible correlations among deceleration parameters ( including @xmath11 ) as well as the prompt gamma - ray emission properties .",
    "we make an extensive search for the onset of afterglow signature in the optical and x - ray lightcurves . our sample selection is presented in section 2 .",
    "the temporal characteristics and their correlations are presented in section 3 , and the relation between the prompt gamma - ray properties and the deceleration properties are investigated in section 4 . in particular , we constrain @xmath11 and the deceleration radius of the fireball for the @xmath0-known sample , and discover a tight correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath27 .",
    "discussion and conclusions are presented in sections 5 and 6 , respectively .",
    "a concordance cosmology with parameters @xmath28 km s@xmath29 mpc@xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are adopted .",
    "notation @xmath32 denotes @xmath33 in the cgs units throughout the paper .",
    "we make an extensive search for the smooth  bump \" feature as the onset of grb afterglow .",
    "the flares or the reversed shock emission component introduce confusion to identify the onset feature , especially in the x - ray band .",
    "we therefore employ the following two criteria to selection the samples .",
    "first , the bump is smooth without superimposing significant flares around the bump .",
    "second , the decay slopes post the peak time is shallower than @xmath34 . through literature search ,",
    "we obtain 20 optical - selected grbs that show the afterglow onset feature .",
    "we also go through the swift xrt lightcurve archive that has been processed by our group in the past ( from january 2005 to september 2009 ) , and identify 12 x - ray selected sample with afterglow onset signature .",

    "only few cases have simultaneous optical observation .",
    "nineteen out of 20 grbs in the optical - selected sample have simultaneously x - ray observations .",
    "we find only one case , grb 080319c , that shows a clear achromatic onset bump in both the optical and x - ray bands .",
    "this suggests that the external shock emission indeed contributes to both the optical and the x - ray band . for",
    "most optical - selected sample grbs , on the other hand , the early x - ray lightcurves either show erratic x - ray flares or internal plateaus that are believed to be powered by the grb central engine , or the x - ray observations started only after the optical bump peak . inspecting the two samples shown in figures 1 and 2",
    ", we find that the onset bumps in the optical - selected sample are usually smoother than those observed in the x - ray - selected sample .",
    "seventeen out of the 20 grbs in the optical - selected sample and two out of 12 grbs in the x - ray - selected sample have redshift measurements . in the following ,",
    "we mostly use only the @xmath0-known optical - selected sample in our analysis but will use the @xmath0-known x - ray - selected sample to confirm the findings .",
    "we fit the lightcurves with an empirical model proposed by kocevski & liang ( 2001 ) , @xmath35^{-\\frac{r+d}{r+1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the maximum flux at _ @xmath4 _ , _ @xmath37 _ is a reference time , and _",
    "r _ and _ d _ are the rising and decaying power - law indices , respectively .",

    "_ is employed for our fitting .",
    "this routine performs levenberg - marquardt least - square fit to the data for a given model .",
    "it optimizes the model parameters so that the sum of the squares of the deviations between the data and the model becomes minimal .",
    "the time interval and the fitting curve for each grb are shown in figures 1 and 2 , and the fitting parameters are summarized in tables 1 and 2 . of our fits for some optical lightcurves are large .",
    "this is due to the fluctuations in the lightcurves and small observational errors in the optical data . ]",
    "notice that the lightcurves of some grbs , such as 050820a , 060607a , 070411 , 071031 , 080330 , show significant energy injection or re - brightening features after the deceleration bump .",
    "we make our fits only around the bump .",
    "our fits are also shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "for each fitting lightcurve , we take the full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) as a characteristic width ( @xmath1 ) of the bump , and measure the rising and decaying timescales ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) at fwhm .",

    "the following statistics applies to the optical - selected sample .",
    "as shown in figure [ dis_time ] , the rising index @xmath38 of most bursts are in the range of @xmath40 , with three exceptional cases , i.e. , grbs 080330 ( @xmath41 ) , 060607a ( @xmath42 ) , and 050820a ( @xmath43 ) . inspecting the optical lightcurve of grb 080330 , the optical flux increases slowly , keeping almost a constant in @xmath44 seconds post the grb trigger .",
    "this feature is similar to that observed in grb 060614 . for grbs 060607a , and 050820a ,",
    "their optical lightcurves show a similar behavior , with rapid increase prior to the peak and a normal decay post the peak .",
    "the decaying index @xmath39 is distributed in the range of @xmath45 , with a mean value @xmath46 . except for grbs 080330 and 061007 ,",
    "the decay indices are well consistent with the isotropic forward shock models in a constant density medium .",
    "the decay indices of the two exceptions are @xmath47 , slightly steeper than the normal decay slope predicted by the isotropic forward shock models .",

    "no correlation of the decay index @xmath39 with the other parameters is found .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation of blastwave model , in which the decay slope is dictated by the density profile and the electron spectral index @xmath61 but has nothing to do with the afterglow onset details . on the other hand ,",

    ", the fermi team recently sets the lower limits of @xmath11 for a number of bright lat grbs , e.g. @xmath97 for grb 080916c ( abdo et al .",

    "for grb 080916c , one has @xmath100 erg ( abdo et al .",
    "2009a ) , which corresponds to @xmath101 according to the @xmath66 relation ( eq.[[gam - eiso ] ] ) .",

    "however , as discussed in the introduction , we believe that this is due to that the fermi team did not use the most conservative method to derive @xmath104 . since grb 090902b clearly shows a distinct non - thermal component extending to high energy which clearly has a different origin from the mev component ( and very likely from different emission regions , a. peer et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "one should have used the maximum photon energy of the mev component to estimate @xmath104 , which would lead to a consistent result with the prediction of the @xmath105 relation . for the lat short grb 090510 , one has @xmath106 , which corresponds to @xmath107 from the @xmath66 relation .",
    "this is significantly smaller than @xmath108 set by the 31 gev photon detected during the first second .",

    "( 2009 ) even derived @xmath109 for this burst .",
    "the inconsistency is significant .",
    "this can be again due to the non - conservative approach of the fermi team ( since the 31 gev photon is from a different component ) , but more probably it could be that short grbs do not satisfy the @xmath66 relation derived for long grbs .    with @xmath110",
    "derived from the @xmath111 relation , we expect that the corresponding observed @xmath4 is in the range of @xmath112 seconds for a typical redshift @xmath113 according to the @xmath114 correlation ( eq.[[gamma_0-tp ] ] ) . in this time period ,",
    "the observed x - rays are generally dominated by the grb tail emission or flares .",
    "this may be , at least partially , the reason why not many early x - ray lightcurves show the clear afterglow onset bump signature .",
    "the @xmath66 relation is very useful to pin down the prompt emission physics of grbs .",
    "one interesting observational correlation is the amati relation , i.e. @xmath115 ( or @xmath116 , with @xmath117 , both as a bulk correlation among bursts and an internal correlation within a burst ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ; wei et al . 2003",
    "; liang et al . 2004 ; yonetoku et al . 2004 ; lu & liang 2009 ) .",
    "however , all the prompt grb emission models predict @xmath118 as a function of both @xmath27 ( or @xmath119 ) and @xmath11 ( e.g. table 1 of zhang & mszros 2002 ) .",
    "there is no straightforward theory that predicts the relationship between @xmath11 and @xmath27 ( or @xmath119 ) . as a result",
    ", any theoretical model can be argued to interpret the amati relation , given a designed @xmath120 correlation .",
    "the @xmath105 correlation discovered here therefore poses great constraints on many prompt emission models .",
    "for example , the internal shock synchrotron model predicts @xmath121 ( zhang & mszros 2002 ) .",
    "the amati relation essentially requires that @xmath122 .",
    "the @xmath123 relation , combined with the trivial proportionality @xmath124 ( a non - correlation between grb duration and luminosity ) , would lead to @xmath125 , which means that @xmath118 is essentially constant for different @xmath27 values .",
    "this is in contradiction with the amati relation , which can be regarded as another argument against the internal shock synchrotron emission model of grb prompt emission ( see also kumar & mcmahon 2008 ; zhang & peer 2009 ) .",
    "the simultaneous observations in the optical and x - ray bands during the early afterglow phase also hold the key to address whether the broad band emission is from the same emission component . with the prompt slewing capability , the x - ray telescope ( xrt , burrows et al .",
    "2004 ) on board swift has established a large sample of x - ray afterglow of grbs . generally , the xrt lightcurves are composed of a few power - law decaying segments and some erratic flares .",
    "although the x - ray lightcurves are diverse among bursts , they can be roughly classified into three groups with a large , uniform sample established by xrt .",
    "the majority is the so - called canonical xrt lightcurves characterized by a steep - shallow - normal - steep decay pattern ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; obrien et al .",
    "2006 ) , although not all the segments show up in every burst ( evans et al .",
    "the second group is composed of those lightcurves that show a single power - law decay from early to late epochs ( liang et al . 2009 ; evans et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the third group includes some grbs that show an `` internal plateau '' that is followed by a rapid drop with a decay slope steeped than -3 ( liang et al . 2007 ;",
    "troja et al .",
    "2007 ; lyons et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the physics origin of the x - ray emission is still a mystery ( e.g. zhang 2007 for a review ) , although the consensus is that there might be diverse origins ( liang et al .",
    "it is clear that the x - ray flares and internal plateaus are of an internal origin .",
    "however the origin of the canonical lightcurve is still subject to debate . ",
    "closure``-relation analyses suggest that the normal decay segment following the shallow decay one in the canonical xrt lightcurves are roughly consistent with the forward shock models ( willingale et al . 2007 ; liang et al .",
    "2007 ) , favoring the long lasting energy injection models for the shallow - decay segment .",
    "however , the optical / x - ray chromatic behavior around the shallow and normal decay transition time ( panaitescu et al .",
    "2006 ; fan & piran 2006 ; liang et al .",
    "2007 ) suggests that the x - ray and optical emissions are two independent components .",
    "some models attribute the entire x - ray emission to the late emission from the central engine , probably related to the long - term accretion history of the central engine ( ghisellini et al . 2007 ; kumar et al . 2008 ; cui et al .",
    "2009 ; cannizzo & gehrels 2009 ) , but the consistency with the ' ' closure - relation \" of the external shock model predictions is not naturally explained in these models .",
    "interestingly , yamazaki ( 2009 ) recently suggested that the x - ray emission might be an independent component prior to the grb trigger , and that the apparent shallow - to - normal transition is merely reference time effect .",
    "liang et al . ( 2009 ) systematically studied the swift canonical grb lightcurves and confirm that shifting the reference time can indeed stretch the canonical lightcurves to single power law lightcurves , and proposed a unified picture for the physical origin of both the canonical and the single power - law decaying xrt lightcurves .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , the optical and x - ray lightcurve behaviors are dramatically different at the early epoch , i.e. , @xmath126 seconds post the grb trigger .",
    "this strongly suggests that the radiations from the two energy bands are not from the same component .",
    "the tight correlations between the observables of the prompt gamma - rays and early optical afterglows shown in fig .",
    "[ corr_eiso_lp ] strongly suggest that the optical emission is likely the  afterglow \" of the grb fireball ( external shock component ) .",
    "this is consistent with the smooth afterglow onset feature observed in the optical band for these grbs .",
    "on the other hand , it also suggests that the early bright x - ray emission is not from the external shock .",
    "one natural question would be : where is the external shock x - ray component ? inspecting the details of the x - ray and optical afterglow lightcurves in figure 1",
    ", we can see that this component is very likely hidden underneath some brighter x - ray emission components in the early epochs ( e.g. flares , internal plateaus , or even normal plateaus ) .",
    "interestingly , one can find an x - ray decay slope similar to that of optical in the late epochs in half of grbs in our sample , including grbs 050820a , 060418 , 060605 , 061007 , 070318 , 070411 , 071031 , 080319c , 080810 , 081203 , and 090102 .",
    "we therefore can not exclude the possibility that the late x - ray and optical emissions share the same external shock origin .    the mixture of different emission components in the x - ray observations ( willingale et al . 2007 ; liang et al .",
    "2007 ; liang et al . 2009 ; nardini et al . 2009 ) also naturally interprets the fact that the rarity of the onset afterglow feature observed in the x - ray band .",
    "this requires that other early x - ray components are not bright enough to outshine the external shock component . in fact , we find only 13 out of @xmath127 cases in the current xrt lightcurve sample .",
    "they are shown in figure 2 .",
    "since the optical band is less affected by the other emission components related to the central engine , one naively expects that the x - ray onset cases should have achromatic optical onset feature as well .",
    "unfortunately , the optical / x - ray joint observations in this sample are rare : only grb 080507 and grb 080319c have early optical observations .",
    "the optical lightcurve of grb 080507 is sparse",
    ". for grb 080319c one indeed observes an achromatic onset feature .",
    "there is an earlier decay feature in the optical lightcurve of grb 080319c .",
    "it may be associated with an internal emission component within such an interpretation .",
    "we have made an extensively search for the afterglow onset  bump \" feature from early afterglow lightcurves , both in the optical band ( through literature survey ) and in the x - ray band ( through systematically analyzing the swift xrt data ) .",
