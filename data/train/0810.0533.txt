    "the nemo  3 has been taking data since 2003 in the modane underground laboratory located in the frejus tunnel at the depth of 4800 m w.e .",
    "its method of @xmath5-decay study is based on the detection of the electron tracks in a tracking device and the energy measurement in a calorimeter .",
    "the detector  @xcite has a cylindrical shape .",
    "thin source foils ( @xmath6 ) are located in the middle of the tracking volume surrounded by the calorimeter .",
    "almost 10 kg of enriched @xmath5 isotopes ( listed in table  [ tab : t12 ] ) were used to produce the source foils .",
    "the tracking chamber contains 6180 open drift cells operating in the geiger mode .",
    "it provides a vertex resolution of about 1 cm . the calorimeter consists of 1940 plastic scintillator blocks with photomultiplier readout .",
    "the energy resolution is 14 - 17%/@xmath7 fwhm .",
    "the time resolution of 250 ps allows excellect suppression of the crossing electron background .",
    "a 25  g magnetic field is used for charge identification .",
    "the detector is capable of identifying e@xmath8 , e@xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 particles and allows good discrimination between signal and background events .",
    "measurements of the @xmath13 decay half - lives were performed for 7 isotopes available in nemo  3 ( see table  [ tab : t12 ] ) .",
    "new preliminary results based on higher statistics than previously are presented here for two of these isotopes : @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    ".nemo  3 results of half - life measurement.[tab : t12 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a possible design for the supernemo detector @xcite could be planar and modular : the 100 kg of enriched isotopes could be placed in 20 modules each containing 5 kg of isotopes .",
    "each source could have a thickness of 40 @xmath16 and a surface of 4 x 3 @xmath17 .",
    "for each module , the tracking device could be a drift chamber made of around 3000 cells , operating in geiger mode .",
    "for each module , the calorimeter could either be made of around 1000 scintillators blocks coupled to low - radioactivity pmts , or of scintillators bars , coupled to around 100 pmts ( see figure [ module ] ) .",
    "the best sensitivity for the high - purity germanium detectors used for nemo-3 is 60  @xmath18bq / kg for @xmath19 and 200 @xmath18bq / kg for @xmath20 .",
    "the goal of the r@xmath4d phase is to improve the sensitivity by developping 800 @xmath21 high purity germaniun ( with canberra - eurisys ) with shields improvment and a new ultra - pure cryostat .",
    "a new planar germanium detector with a resolution of 0.5 kev at 40 kev is also in development .",
    "the bipo detector @xcite has been developped to measure the radiopurity in @xmath19 and in @xmath20 of the source foils before their installation in the supernemo detector .",
    "the goal is to measure 5 kg of foils in 1 month with a sensitivity of 2 @xmath18bq / kg in @xmath19 and of 10  @xmath18bq / kg in @xmath20 .",
    "the principle is to tag the electron emitted by the beta desintegration of @xmath22 or of @xmath20 , then to tag the alpha emitted by the desintegration of @xmath23 or of @xmath24 ( with a decay half - time of 300 ns or of 164 @xmath18s ) .",
    "the thin source can be put in a sandwich of scintillators . for the measurement of the source contained in one module of the supernemo detector ( 12 @xmath17 ) , the background has to be very low , less than 1 event per month .",
    "already , a prototype using 20 cm x 20 cm x 3 mm plastic scintillators has been developped and installed in the frejus underground laboratory ; with the measured background , the expected sensitivity extrapolated for the full bipo detector is of the order of 5 @xmath18bq / kg in @xmath19 .",
    "the goal of the calorimeter r@xmath4d is to reach a fwhm energy resolution of 4@xmath25 for 3 mev electrons ( 7@xmath25 for 1 mev electrons ) and to optimize the number of channels and the detector geometry .",
    "the goal of the r@xmath4d for scintillators is to improve the light yield and the homogeneity .",
    "plastic scintillators are developped in collaboration with kharkhov and dubna , trying to improve the performances of polystyrene and to develop polyvinylxylene .",
    "already , a fwhm of ( 8.2 @xmath26 0.1 ) @xmath25 for 1 mev electrons has been obtained for 10 cm thick plastic scintillator coupled to a @xmath27 pmt .",
    "tests with different wrappings of the scintillators are also proceeded in kharkhov .",
    "liquid scintillators are also studied : their advantages are the high light yield , the very good uniformity and transparency ; the challenge is to satisfy the mechanical constraints , especially for the entrance window , which has to be as thin as possible , in order not to degrade the electron energy .    the aim of the r@xmath4d for pmts is to improve the quantum efficiency , the collection efficiency and to develop low radioactivity pmts : an agreement between photonis and in2p3 has been signed , tests are also done with hamamatsu and etl . already , pmts with very high quantum efficiencies ( 43@xmath25 for 3 inches and 35@xmath25 for 8 inches ) have been developped .",
    "slow and fast pmts are also studied .",
    "the goal is also to have a higher compacity by reducing the number of channels , without reducing too much the light collection .",
    "the energy measurement with scintillator bars with 2 pmts or with optical fibers is also studied .",
