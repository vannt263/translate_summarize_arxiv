    "we shall consider the situation where an otherwise relativistic theory is not unitary .",
    "the lack of unitarity at a fundamental level will be postulated as due to space - time foam @xcite . in the decoherence scenario",
    "the s - matrix of the effective low - energy field theory would then have to be replaced by a linear non - factorisable superscattering operator @xmath5 relating initial and final - state density matrices @xmath6  @xcite @xmath7 if this is correct then the usual formulation of quantum mechanics has to be modified ; from the theory of open systems ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) we know that , on tracing over the environmental degrees of freedom , a system can be described by a master equation @xmath8   + \\lambda\\rho \\label{liouvqm}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is a liovillian superoperator .",
    "the foam can be regarded as an environment and so the open systems point of view is also a natural one .",
    "it should be pointed out that this suggestion may be invalid if there is _ holography _ in quantum gravity  @xcite , such that any information on quantum numbers of matter , that at first sight appears to be lost into the horizon , is somehow reflected back from the horizon surface , thereby maintaining quantum coherence .",
    "this may happen , for instance , in some highly supersymmetric effective theories of strings @xcite , which however do not represent realistic low - energy theories of quantum gravity .",
    "supersymmetry breaking complicates the issue , thus spoiling complete holography .",
    "recently , s. hawking , inspired by the above recent ideas in string theory , has also argued against the loss of coherence in a _",
    "euclidean _ quantum theory of gravity .",
    "in such a model , summation over trivial and non - trivial ( black - hole ) space - time topologies in the path over histories makes an asymptotic observer unsure  as to the existence of the microscopic black hole fluctuation thus resulting in no loss of quantum coherence .",
    "however , this sort of argument is plagued not only by the euclidean formalism , with its concomitant problems of analytic continuation , but also by a lack of a concrete proof , at least up to now .",
    "hence the hypothesis of non - unitary evolution deserves further investigation .",
    "we shall consider  two approaches to space - time which represent distinct ontologies .",
    "the first , d - particle foam , depends on a picture and partial description in terms of capture and emission of stringy matter by d - particles @xcite based on non - critical strings . at late times after this process the induced space - time metric has interesting stochastic off - diagonal structure @xcite due to d - particle recoil which has an effect on correlated meson flavour pairs compatible with the earlier conjectured @xmath10 effect @xcite,@xcite.the second picture of space - time foam @xcite that we will consider is based on a heuristic non - local effective theory approach to gravitational fluctuations .",
    "the non - locality arises because the the fluctuation scale is taken to be intermediate between the planck scale and the low energy scale .",
    "furthermore the dominant non - locality was assumed to be bilocal , and , from similarities to quantum brownian motion @xcite,@xcite plausible arguments can be given for a thermal bath model for space - time foam @xcite .",
    "it is rare to have a test which can qualitativley distinguish space - time foams and we will show that the study of correlations in neutral flavoured mesons can provide one .",
    "earlier work has suggested that this may be the case @xcite but the analysis for the thermal bath case although suggestive was quite incomplete . in this paper",
    "we will show that the two foams have qualitatively different behaviour even allowing for non - thermal states of the bath .",
    "neutral mesons such as the @xmath11 mesons have in the past been pivotal in the study of discrete symmetries @xcite.the decay of a ( generic ) meson ( e.g. the @xmath12 meson ) with quantum numbers @xmath13 @xcite , leads to a pair state @xmath14 of neutral mesons ( @xmath15 ) which has the form of the entangled state@xmath16 this state has @xmath17 .",

    "are believed to be inherently unobservable delocalised modes which fail to decouple from light ( i.e. the observed ) states .",
    "the effective theory of the light states which are measured by local scattering experiments can be described by a non - critical liouville string .",
    "this results in an irreversible temporal evolution in target space with decoherence and associated entropy production .",

    "these new non - perturbative objects are known as d - branes and their inclusion leads to a scattering picture of space - time fluctuations .",
    "the study of d - brane dynamics has been made possible by polchinski s realization  @xcite that such solitonic string backgrounds can be described in a conformally invariant way in terms of world sheets with boundaries . on these boundaries",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions for the collective target - space coordinates of the soliton are imposed .",
    "heuristically , when low energy matter given by a closed ( or open ) string propagating in a @xmath62-dimensional space - time collides with a very massive d - particle embedded in this space - time , the d - particle recoils as a result ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : recoil ] ) . since there are no rigid bodies in general relativity the recoil fluctuations of the brane and their effectively stochastic back - reaction on space - time can not be neglected .",
    "a concrete model in the form of a supersymmetric space - time foam has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "it is based on parallel brane worlds ( with three large spatial dimensions ) , moving in a bulk space - time which contains a gas  of d - particles .",
    "the number of parallel branes used is dictated by the requirements of target - space supersymmetry in the limit of zero - velocity branes .",
    "one of these branes represents allegedly our observable universe .",
    "as the brane moves in the bulk space , d - particles cross the brane in a random way . from the point of view of an observer in the brane the crossing d",
    "- particles will appear as space - time defects which flash on and off , i.e. microscopic space - time fluctuations .",
    "this will give the four - dimensional brane world a d - foamy  structure.using this model for space - time fluctuations we will obtain an expression for the _ induced _ space - time distortion as a result of d - particle recoil .",
    "in the weakly coupled string limit , using logarithmic conformal field theory , it can be shown that @xcite : @xmath63 where the suffix @xmath64 denotes temporal ( liouville ) components and @xmath65 is a regularised heavyside function with integral representation @xmath66 with @xmath67 the momentum of the propagating closed - string state before ( after ) the recoil ; @xmath68 are the spatial collective coordinates of the d particle and @xmath69 is identified with the target minkowski time @xmath49 for @xmath70 after the collision  @xcite ( in units where the string slope @xmath71 is taken to be @xmath72 ) .",
    "these relations have been calculated for non - relativistic branes where @xmath73 is small . to leading order for large @xmath49 , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is",
    "the momentum transfer during a collision and @xmath76 is the planck mass ( actually , to be more precise , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the ( weak ) string coupling , and @xmath79 is a string mass scale ) ; so @xmath80 is constant in space - time but depends on the energy content of the low energy particle .",
    "the operator @xmath75 is complicated to treat but on considering many collisions it can be regarded , in some sense , as random ; consequently in @xcite this transfer process was modelled by a classical gaussian random variable @xmath81 ( for an isotropic foam ) which multiplies the momentum operator @xmath82 for the particle : @xmath83 moreover the mean and variance of @xmath81 are given by @xmath84 the process of capture and emission does not have to conserve flavour .",
    "consequently we need to generalise the stochastic structure to allow for this.the fluctuations of each component of the metric tensor @xmath85 will then not be just given by the simple recoil distortion ( [ recoil ] ) , but instead will be taken to have a @xmath86 ( flavour ) structure @xcite : @xmath87 where @xmath88 , is the identity and @xmath89 are  the pauli matrices .",
    "the above parametrisation has been taken for simplicity and we will also consider motion to be in the @xmath90- direction which is natural since the meson pairs move collinearly . in",
    "any given realisation of the random variables for a gravitational background ,  the system evolution can be considered to be given by the klein - gordon equation for a two component spinless neutral meson field @xmath91{c}\\phi_{1}\\\\ \\phi_{2}\\end{array } \\right )   $ ] ( corresponding to the two flavours ) with mass matrix @xmath92 @xmath93 .",
    "we thus have @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the covariant derivative . since the christoffel symbols vanish ( as the @xmath96 are independent of space - time ) the @xmath95 coincide with @xmath97 .",
    "hence within this flavour changing background ( [ kleingordon ] ) becomes @xmath98 we shall consider the two particle tensor product states made from the single particle states @xmath43 and @xmath99 @xmath45 .",
    "this includes the correlated states which include the state of the @xmath10 effect . in view of ( [ kg2 ] )",
    "the evolution of this state is governed by a hamiltonian @xmath100 @xmath101 which is the natural generalisation of the standard klein gordon hamiltonian in a one particle situation where @xmath102 with @xmath103 or @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath100 is a single particle hamiltonian and in order to study two particle states associated with @xmath45 we can define @xmath105 in the natural way ( in terms of @xmath100 ) and then the total hamiltonian is @xmath106 @xmath105 .",
    "the effect of space - time foam on the initial entangled state of two neutral mesons is conceptually difficult to isolate , given that the meson state is itself entangled with the bath .",
    "nevertheless , in the context of our specific model , which is written as a stochastic hamiltonian , one can estimate the order of the associated @xmath10-effect of @xcite by applying non - degenerate perturbation theory to the states @xmath107 , @xmath99 , @xmath45 ( where the label @xmath108 is redundant since @xmath56 already determines it ) .",

    "owing to the form of the hamiltonian ( [ genkg ] ) the gravitationally perturbed states will still be momentum eigenstates .",

    "garay @xcite has argued that the effect of non - trivial topologies related to space - time foam and a non - zero minimum length can be modelled by a field theory with non - local interactions on a flat background in terms of a complete set of local functions @xmath142 of the fields @xmath12 at a space - time point @xmath90 .",
    "his argument is based on general arguments related to problems of measurement @xcite .",
    "also , by considering the infinite redhshifting near the horizon for an observer far away from the horizon of a black hole , padmanabhan @xcite has argued that a foam consisting of virtual black holes would magnify planck scale physics for observers asymptotically far from the horizon and thus an effective non - local field theory description would be appropriate .",

    "there is no dissipation which might be expected from the fluctuation diffusion theorem because the noise is classical .  since the energy scales for typical experiments are much smaller than those associated with gravitational quantum fluctuations garay considered @xmath154 to be proportional to a dirac delta function and argued that the master equation was that for a thermal bath .",
    "a thermal field represents a bath about which there is minimal information since only the mean energy of the bath is known , a situation which maybe valid also for space - time foam . in applications of quantum information",
    "it has been shown that a system of two qubits ( or two - level systems ) initially in a separable state ( and interacting with a thermal bath ) can actually be entangled by such a single mode bath @xcite . as the system evolves the degree of entanglement is sensitive to the initial state .",
