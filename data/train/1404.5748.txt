    "during the eternal inflation @xcite , an infinite number of bubble universes with different ds and ads vacua will spawn .",
    "the bubble universe with a ds minimum will arrive at a ds regime asymptotically , while the universe with ads minimum will collapse rapidly . inside an observational bubble universe ,",
    "a phase of the slow - roll inflation and reheating is required , which will set the initial conditions of the  big bang \" evolution , i.e. a homogeneous hot universe with the scale invariant primordial perturbation .",
    "the slow roll inflation should occur in a high energy scale , which is required to insure that the amplitude of primordial perturbation is consistent with the observations and the reheating temperature is suitable for a hot big bang evolution after inflation .",
    "however , if the scale of the eternally inflating background is very low , the spawning of observational universe will be island - like , which is exponentially unfavored , since it requires a large upward tunneling , e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and also @xcite,@xcite,@xcite for an alternative study .",
    "recently , it has been argued that the nonsingular bounce in the eternally inflating background might significantly alter this result @xcite , and also @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the crunch of ads bubble will be followed by a bounce , which makes the field inside bubble be able to finally land at a ds minimum , thus we actually may have a transition from ads to ds @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the introduction of ads bounce insures that the timelike geodesics in the eternally inflating spacetime dose not end at the big crunch singularity inside ads bubbles , which may make the eternally inflating spacetime allow for a well - defined watcher measure @xcite , in which what is counted is the observations made by a single observer at a timelike geodesic , and also close related refs.@xcite,@xcite .",
    "in addition , ads bounce also brings an efficient route to the slow - roll inflation .",
    "the bounce inflation may explain not only the power deficit on large angular scales , but also a large dipole power asymmetry in cmb @xcite,@xcite,@xcite observed by the planck collaboration , see also @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    however , if the field inside bubble lands at a ads minimum of its effective potential , the bubble universe will collapse and bounce again .",
    "thus the bubble universe may go through a sequence of ads crunches , during which it is cyclic , until the field inside bubble finally arrives at a ds minimum . here ,",
    "for convenience we call such a cyclic evolution as ads cycles .",
    "recently , the cosmological cyclic scenario , in which the universe goes through the periodic sequence of contraction and expansion @xcite , has been rewaked @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , which has leaded to significant insights for the origin of the observable universe . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it is showed that during different cycles in cyclic universe , the universe may be in different vacua of a landscape , in which the inflation after bounce is responsible for the emergence of observational universe . in ref.@xcite , it is showed that the inflation after bounce causes the cosmological hysteresis , which will lead to the increase of the amplitude of cycles .",
    "the cyclic or oscillating universe model also have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it is generally thought that the background of cyclic universe is homogeneous cycle by cycle all along .",
    "however , when the perturbation is considered , the case will be altered @xcite,@xcite , and also @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the amplitude of curvature perturbation on large scale is increasing in the contracting phase , while it is almost constant in the expanding phase .",
    "thus the net result of one cycle is that the amplitude of perturbation is amplified .",
    "this amplification of perturbation will be multiplied cycle by cycle , which will eventually lead that the homogeneity of background is destroyed .",
    "thus it is hardly possible that the ads cycles of the bubble universe will continue all along until the field inside the bubble finally arrives at a ds minimum .",
    "how the amplification of perturbation affects the evolution of bubble universe in eternally inflating background is still interesting to study in details .",
    "recently , the amplification of field perturbation , which is induced by the self - interaction of field , has been studied in ref.@xcite . here ,",
    "we will concentrate on the amplification of field perturbation induced by the amplification of the curvature perturbation , which will generally arise when the bubble universe goes through ads cycles .",
    "we will show that due to the amplification of field fluctuation , the bubble universe going through ads cycles will inevitably fragment within two or three cycles , and a number of new ",
    "bubble \" universes will come into being from these fragments . in the eternally inflating scenario , compared to the nucleation of bubbles in ds background , the proliferation of bubble universe during ads cycles is obviously more rapid , which will help the eternal inflation to more rapidly populate the whole landscape , wherever initially it happens .",
    "we will firstly review the main result of the classical evolution of field during the ads bounce , see also @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    in eternally inflating background , the ads bubble universe nucleated will inevitably collapse .",
    "the initial conditions of the bubble universe is set by the instanton .",
    "we follow @xcite .",
    "initially the bubble universe is in a phase dominated by the curvature @xmath0 , in which @xmath1 and @xmath2 is overdamped and approximately constant .",
    "when @xmath3 , the field @xmath2 begins to oscillate around its minimum with @xmath4 , which is equivalent to the matter with the state equation @xmath5 . here , _",
    "mat0<_cur [ mc]is assumed .",
    "this implies that the evolution is approximately that of a ads universe with the negative curvature , asin ( h_t ) , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the depth of ads minimum .",
    "the expansion ends at @xmath8 and is followed by the contraction dominated by @xmath9 , i.e. the curvature phase . before the bounce , the bubble universe may be still in a curvature phase , or a kinetic phase dominated by @xmath10 .",
    "when the bounce scale is larger than the potential barrier , the field will be able to stride over the barrier .",
    "after the bounce , @xmath11 will be rapidly diluted and the field will eventually land at a different place of its effective potential .",
    "thus the field @xmath2 will walk certain distance during the ads bounce , i.e. one single ads cycle . here , ",
    "land \" means that the effective potential of field begins to become dominated again .",
    "we define this displacement of @xmath2 as @xmath12 , and have @xcite,@xcite & & m_p(h_b^4h^2_kinh^2 _ land ) , [ de]where ` kin ' defines the beginning of the kinetic phase , which is the end of the matter contracting phase , and @xmath13 is defined . the result is consistent with that of ref.@xcite .",
    "we may assume @xmath14 , both which are generally smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "thus we have m_p .",
    "[ de]during this period the number of hills and valleys the field flies over is determined by the detail of the landscape .    when the field lands at the ds minimum , the bubble universe will be in a ds state .",
    "however , if the field lands at a ads minimum of its effective potential , the universe will collapse again , which will be followed by the ads bounce again .",
    "the bubble universe may go through a sequence of ads crunches , during which it is cyclic , called as ads cycles , until the field finally lands at a ds minimum . in appendix , a  toy \" model of ads cycles",
    "is introduced .        during the contraction of ads cycles , the amplification of @xmath16 is faster than @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath17 , the bubble universe may be in a phase dominated by @xmath18 , i.e. the matter contraction .",
    "we will see that the matter contracting phase is significant to rapidly amplify the perturbation . however , when @xmath19 , we have @xmath20 , which implies the oscillating phase ends .",
    "thus it seems hardly possible that we have the matter contracting phase in the @xmath21 cycle @xcite .",
    "however , after the @xmath21 cycle the initial conditions of the field evolution will be set not by the instanton , but by the details of previous cycle . in this case , the oscillating energy @xmath18 of field will may be large , thus we may have the matter contracting phase in the cycles after the @xmath21 cycle .",
    "however , we may also have the matter contracting phase in the @xmath21 cycle when relaxing the assumption ( [ mc ] ) .",
    "in fig.[fig : potential3 ] , we plot a potential , for which after the bubble nucleates , the field may be placed in a plain of its potential . in this case , the bubble universe may has a short inflationary phase , which will rapidly dilute @xmath9 .",
    "hereafter , the field rolls toward ads minimum , and begins to oscillate around it",
    ". the evolution will be that of a ads universe with the oscillating energy @xmath18 .",
    "it is generally thought that the ads cycles will continue all the time until the bubble universe finally  transits \" to a ds state .",
    "however , if the perturbation of field is considered , the scenario will be altered .",
    "we will investigate the evolution of the scalar field perturbation through cycles . here , the mode spectrum of the perturbation may involve some supercurvature modes , see e.g.@xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , for simplicity , we will only concentrate on modes whose initial wavelength is smaller than the radius of curvature , and also on almost flat case . in this case",
    ", the calculation of the perturbation may be similar to that in flat case .    in the perturbation equation of scalar field @xmath2",
    ", the terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 , coupling to the metric perturbation @xmath24 , should be not negligible during the contraction , since both @xmath25 and @xmath24 are rapidly increasing .",
    "the equations of perturbations are a set of coupling equations between @xmath24 and @xmath26 , thus solving the equation of @xmath26 has to simultaneously solve the equation of the metric perturbation , which will complicate the calculations . however , noting that the field perturbation is related to the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath27 = r- , [ rp]thus we might firstly calculate @xmath27 and then apply eq.([rp ] ) to obtain @xmath26 .",
    "the equation of @xmath28 in momentum space is @xcite,@xcite u_k^ + ( k^2-z^z ) u_k = 0 , [ uk]after @xmath29 is defined , where @xmath30 is the derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    when @xmath34 , the perturbation mode is leaving the horizon .",
    "when @xmath35 , the solution of @xmath28 given by eq.([uk ] ) is _ k & ~ & c isconstant mode[c ] + & or & d isdecaying / growing mode , [ d]where the @xmath36 mode is decaying or growing is dependent on the behavior of @xmath37 .",
    "the contraction phase may be regarded as a~(t_b - t)^n , [ a]where @xmath38 is negative , and the parameter @xmath39 is constant , which is set only for the convenience of discussion .",
    "thus during the contraction with @xmath40 , the amplitude of @xmath28 will be dominated by the growing mode , @xmath41 in principle , @xmath42 will increase up to the end of this contracting phase .",
    "the amplitude of growing mode before the bounce may inherited by the constant mode after the bounce @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , which is actually the requirement that the curvature perturbation continuously comes through the bounce . while in the expanding phase",
    ", the constant mode is dominated , thus @xmath42 will be unchanged until the beginning of next contraction .    we will regard the beginning time of contracting phase as the beginning of a cycle , and in one single cycle the universe will orderly experience the contraction , bounce and expansion . in the @xmath43 cycle , after the bounce , we have @xmath44 , which will be constant up to the beginning of the @xmath45 cycle . during the contraction of the @xmath45 cycle",

    "the spectrum on small scale is also scale invariant , since the corresponding modes are newly generated in the @xmath87 cycle .",
    "the spectrum of the modes on middle scale will redshift .",
    "the result is consistent with eq.([multip ] ) .    when @xmath72 , it is hardly possible that the background inside the bubble universe is still homogeneous .",
    "the effect of the perturbation on background is plotted in fig.[fig : g4 ] by transforming @xmath42 into @xmath88 in position space .",
    "we see that in the @xmath87 cycle , the increase of the perturbation will eventually make the initially homogeneous background become highly inhomogeneous , i.e. fragment , thus the global cycle of the universe will inevitably terminate .    here , the existence of the matter contracting phase is crucial for the amplification of perturbation .",
    "thus based on the discussions in ii , we may conclude that the bubble universe going through ads cycles will become highly inhomogeneous , or fragment , within two or three cycles , dependent on the details of landscape .     in position space , which reflects the inhomogeneity of background when @xmath89 on large scale.,width=264 ]      we have showed that the bubble universe going through ads cycles will fragment at certain time @xmath90 within the @xmath87 or @xmath91 .",
    "we will see what is the resulting scenario .",

    "thus at this moment it is inevitable that the fields in different causal regions with length @xmath93 will randomly jumps , in which @xmath94 is the hubble parameter at @xmath90 , which generally satisfies @xmath95 .",

    "[ frag]when the matter contraction begins , i.e. @xmath97 , the length @xmath98 of the homogeneous region inside the bubble should at least satisfy @xmath99 . thus noting @xmath100 and @xmath101 , at @xmath90 we have ( l_frag1/h_frag)^3~m_ph_kin 1 , where eq.([frag ] ) is used .",

    "it is conceivable that in different local regions with the radius @xmath102 , the field will jump to a different place of its effective potential . in some regions , the field jumps to certain place of its effective potential , which leads to @xmath103 , thus < 1/ h_frag < l_local , in which @xmath104 is the hubble length of the corresponding region",
    "this implies that the trapped surface has got formed inside these regions . in this sense",

    "thus the friedmann equation is 3m_p^2(aa)^2 -c_a^12.[f]we may integrate it and have t - t_b = m_p .",
    "[ aa]there is a bounce at @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",

    "the field , which is initially in a ads minimum of its effective potential , goes through two ads cycles and finally lands at the ds minimum.,width=264 ]    we plot the evolution of @xmath2 in fig.[fig : pah ] for the potential in the upper panel of fig.[fig : v ] , as well as the kinetic energy and the potential energy in fig.[fig : tv1 ] , and the evolution of @xmath2 in fig.[fig : phi ] for the potential in the lower panel of fig.[fig : v ] . during the contraction , the field @xmath2 oscillates around a ads minimum of its potential , we have sin(m_(t_b - t ) ) , [ osci]where @xmath137 is the integral constant . in light of eq.([osci ] ) , this oscillation lasts for a period corresponds to @xmath138 , which equals to 1 , since we generally have @xmath139 . thus noting @xmath140 , in which @xmath141 is the depth of ads minimum , we have |_*|m_^2 m_p^2 v_bar , [ condition]where the width of the potential barrier is not larger than @xmath142 is required .",
