    "the study of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) of electrons in semi - conductor materials @xcite and , potentially , of bosons in rotating bose gasses @xcite or in artificial gauge fields @xcite has been a fertile ground for the conception of topological phases of matter , which exhibit exotic and exciting theoretical properties .",
    "@xcite in this paper we shall discuss the construction of a fqhe wave function exhibiting a `` multicomponent '' degree of freedom such as a spin , @xcite valley , @xcite isospin , @xcite layer , @xcite or subband . @xcite the wave function describes the low - energy behaviour of a system possessing a vanishing energy gap to quasihole excitations in the thermodynamic limit , and is thus not itself a candidate to describe a topological phase .",
    "nevertheless the study of this wave function is an interesting exploration that enhances the understanding of the construction of `` multicomponent '' fqhe wave functions in general .",
    "an ideal theoretical description of a fqhe state comprises at least the following three ingredients : a local hamiltonian which describes the ground state and excitation spectrum of the hilbert space ; relatively simple analytic wave functions which are the highest density zero energy states corresponding to the hilbert space of that hamiltonian ; and a ( rational ) two - dimensional ( 2d ) conformal field theory ( cft ) which generates these wave functions .",
    "if a plasma analogy is available , then a gapped state is associated with the analogous plasma being in a screening phase .",

    "rezayi series , the gaffnian and haffnian wave functions , the halperin wave functions and the non - abelian spin - singlet ( nass ) states @xcite it has been possible to i ) determine simple analytical expressions for the polynomial wave functions , and ii ) construct a local hamiltonian whose zero energy eigenstates are in one - to - one correspondence with those polynomial wave functions .",
    "a key feature in each of these special cases is that the wave functions are uniquely defined by their vanishing properties .",
    "changing wave functions describing a fqhe state in a seemingly innocuous way , may in fact have severe consequences .",
    "the wave function of the moore  read state for spinless bosons vanishes quadratically when three of the constituent bosons are coincident .",
    "the gaffnian wave function is obtained by changing this behaviour , such that the wave function vanishes as a third power , when three constituent particles are coincident .",
    "@xcite this simple change , however , results in a nonunitary , compressible wave function , which does not describe a topological phase .",
    "nevertheless nonunitary wave functions such as the gaffnian are still of interest as they are thought to correspond to critical points between other unitary , incompressible topological phases .",
    "this scenario is well understood in the case of the haldane ",

    "@xcite similar scenarios have been suggested for the gaffnian.@xcite it is noteworthy that the gaffnian wave function has large overlap with an incompressible composite fermion state thus suggesting that the gaffnian is a critical point between the composite fermion phase and some other phase .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we present evidence for a quantum hall wave function , which inherits properties from both the nass state  a unitary , spin - singlet quantum hall state  and the nonunitary gaffnian .",
    "such a wave function has also been considered in ref .  .",
    "most notably , we argue that the wave function can be written as a special polynomial and that it also corresponds to the highest density zero energy state of a certain local hamiltonian .",
    "we christen it the `` spin - singlet gaffnian '' ( ssg ) .",
    "( throughout this work , we shall describe how the wave function corresponds to a `` spin '' degree of freedom , however , note that all of what follows applies equally well to any other type of multicomponent degree of freedom such as valley or layer index . )",

    "we have determined that the counting of zero energy eigenstates in the quasihole spectrum and also the entanglement spectrum @xcite matches the counting predicted by the squeezing algorithm .",
    "the counting of zero energy eigenstates is also found to be identical to the result generated by the spinful version of the generalized pauli principle .",
    "our second key result is an analytic form for the ground - state wave function .",

    "the ssg ground state occurs at filling factor @xmath3 ( and on the sphere , it has a shift @xmath4 ) .",
    "the proposed analytic construction for the ssg is consistent with the vanishing properties required by the cft and the ground state of the hilbert space generated by squeezing .",

    "[ secnumerics ] we shall present numerical evidence demonstrating that the zero modes generated by diagonalizing the local hamiltonian presented here are in precise agreement with the zero modes generated by the squeezing algorithm and the counting obtained from the generalized pauli principle .      in prior investigations , most notably for the laughlin and moore",
    " read wave functions , it has been determined that trial quantum hall wave functions correspond to unique , zero energy ground states of certain model hamiltonians .",
    "@xcite often , these model hamiltonians are most simply expressible in terms of haldane pseudopotentials @xcite and their generalizations .",
    "@xcite given a system with a certain @xmath5-body interaction potential @xmath6 , the action of a pseudopotential is to project out a particular component of that interaction .",
    "those components are labelled by a convenient set of quantum numbers , which describe all possible few - particle interactions .",
    "the vector space of few - particle interactions is spanned by specifying both the relative angular momentum @xmath7 and , if we consider a spin degree of freedom as well , the spin quantum number @xmath8 also .",
    "( note that in general it is necessary to further distinguish between distinct interaction components with the same @xmath9 .",
    "in other words , there exists in general a subvector space of dimension @xmath10 for each @xmath7 and @xmath8 sector .",
    "@xcite in this paper , however , we shall only be concerned with subspaces of dimension @xmath10=1 or 0 , and so , for clarity , we omit any additional notation . ) pseudopotentials specify projection operators in the hamiltonian and are thus labelled by two distinct sets of such quantum numbers .",
    "the pseudopotential @xmath11 is expressed in terms of the vector space @xmath12 and the @xmath5-body interaction potential @xmath6 as @xmath13 the general form of the hamiltonian is then given by @xmath14 such a basis of pseudopotentials is particularly convenient when the interaction potential is rotationally and/or spin rotationally invariant , since in that case the pseudopotentials are diagonal in @xmath7 , @xmath8 , or both .    at our convenience , we can pick certain special many - body interactions ( such as @xmath15-function - type interactions ) for which only a small set of pseudopotentials remain nonzero .",
    "the impact of specifying a positive value of a given pseudopotential in a model hamiltonian is to assign energy to the corresponding component of the interaction , therefore , if such a component is present in a given trial wave function , then that wave function will not be a zero energy state of our hamiltonian .",
    "conversely , if a component is not present in a given trial wave function , then we can include the corresponding pseudopotential in the hamiltonian without introducing an extra energy cost . in this way we can tailor the hamiltonian to correspond to the desired properties of a given trial ground - state wave function ( these properties might come , for instance , from a cft description of the state ;",
    "[ seccft ] ) .    to give an example , briefly",
    ", it is known that the moore  read",
    "wave function for bosons at @xmath16 is the unique , highest density zero energy ground state of a spin - polarized three - body contact interaction .",
    "@xcite the space of pseudopotentials for spin - polarized three - body interactions is spanned by a relative angular momentum @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 takes only its maximal value for a three - body interaction , @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite ( note a slight abuse of notation here : we are denoting bosons as if they are spin-1/2 objects , e.g. , three bosons can have @xmath17 and @xmath18 interaction channels . in actual fact",
    "we are describing systems such as cold atomic gasses for which bosons can be engineered to have internal two - state degrees of freedom , and we have simply mapped that two - state degree of freedom onto a spin degree of freedom . ) in the language of pseudopotentials , the moore  read state corresponds to @xmath19 being positive and all other pseudopotentials being zero and ,",
    "in addition , the corresponding hilbert space is restricted to only spin - polarized sectors .",
    "along similar lines , the spin - polarized gaffnian wave function for bosons corresponds to @xmath20 and @xmath21 being positive and all other pseudopotentials being zero , and again the hilbert space is restricted to spin - polarized sectors ( note that for @xmath22 , @xmath17 , and @xmath23 , we have a 0-dimensional vector space of wave functions , so no corresponding @xmath22 , @xmath17 , and @xmath23 pseudopotential can occur ) . in these examples",
    "we observe that the pseudopotentials are in fact diagonal in the @xmath9 sectors .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the interaction being , respectively , rotationally and spin - rotationally invariant .",
    "this feature will remain present in our application of pseudopotentials to the ssg wave function , and so at this point we shall drop the repeated indices and denote diagonal pseudopotentials by @xmath24 .",
    "the bosonic nass state , like the moore  read state , corresponds to a spin - polarized three - body contact interaction , however the hilbert space now includes additional spin sectors ( not just the spin - polarized sector ) . in the language of pseudopotentials , the bosonic nass state is the highest density zero energy ground state of a hamiltonian with the positive , diagonal pseudopotential @xmath25 .",
    "motivated by the generalization of the moore ",
    "read hamiltonian to the gaffnian hamiltonian , our proposal for the ssg hamiltonian is to keep @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 positive .",
    "the proposed hamiltonian for the ssg wave function is thus expressed as @xmath28    from this pseudopotential hamiltonian , we can already infer some properties of its zero energy eigenstates . because the three - body interaction in the @xmath17 channel is identical to the hamiltonian generating the ( polarized ) gaffnian",
    ", the zero energy eigenstates will vanish as at least a third power when three particles with the same spin are brought to the same point .",
    "in addition , when three particles have overall spin @xmath18 , the wave functions vanish at least quadratically .",
    "these are indeed the vanishing properties consistent with the cft description of the ssg , as we shall describe in sec .",
    "[ seccft ] .",
    "it is worth stating here that the ssg wave function likely also corresponds to the ground state of other , more complicated , local hamiltonians involving @xmath5-body terms with @xmath29 , following the line of reasoning discussed in ref .  .",
    "there is another way to characterize the spin - singlet gaffnian , apart from by means of the hamiltonian we introduced above .",
    "this method is the so - called `` squeezing method '' .",
    "the idea underlying the method is that for many model states , the wave functions have a large number of zero coefficients if expressed in terms of the space of all possible monomials .",
    "these zeros are closely related to the vanishing properties of the wave functions .",
    "the method was pioneered in ref .   .",
    "the spinful case , which we will employ here , was described in great detail in ref .  .",
    "we consider quantum hall states on the sphere , @xcite in the presence of @xmath30 flux quanta . in the lowest landau level",
    ", this construction gives rise to @xmath31 orbitals , whose occupation numbers will be denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "these orbitals have angular momentum @xmath33 .",
    "we will use the orbital occupation numbers to label the states in the hilbert space .",
    "because total angular momentum is a good quantum number , we can split the hilbert space into sectors with different values of total @xmath34 , and we will always consider the number of particles @xmath35 to be fixed . for spinless fermions , the pauli principle specifies that the occupation of any orbital @xmath36 can be 0 or 1 , while for bosons , there is no constraint .    to obtain all states in a particular @xmath34 sector ,",
    "we divide the @xmath35 particles over the orbitals , such that one obtains the correct value of total @xmath34 , and such that the particles are `` desqueezed '' as much as possible .",
    "this means that for an even number of bosons in the @xmath37 sector , one considers the occupation @xmath38 . to obtain the other states in this sector",
    ", one generates all possible pairwise rearrangements of particles occupying orbitals , keeping the total @xmath34 fixed . in the general case ,",
    "this entails @xmath39 transforming into @xmath40 , where all the other occupation numbers remain unchanged . in this way",
    ", one obtains the _ full _ hilbert space in each total @xmath34 sector .",
    "as we alluded to above , the wave functions of many model states have a large number of zero components , if expressed in the hilbert space described above .",
    "for instance , if one considers the @xmath41 bosonic laughlin state , it suffices to construct a _ reduced _ hilbert space , by starting to squeeze from the following so - called _ root configuration _ , @xmath42 , instead of the completely desqueezed configuration @xmath38 .",
    "all states in the _ full _ hilbert space which do not appear in the _ reduced _ hilbert space have zero coefficient in the laughlin state .",
    "moreover , it turns out that there is only one @xmath43 state one can construct in the _ reduced _ hilbert space .",
    "thus , to obtain the laughlin state for a certain number of particles , one constructs the reduced hilbert space from the root configuration @xmath42 , and demands that @xmath44 on a general state in this reduced hilbert space gives zero .",
    "this procedure gives a set of equations for the coefficients , whose solution gives the laughlin state , expressed in the monomial basis on the sphere . in a similar way",
    ", many other model states can be obtained .",
    "for instance , to obtain the level-@xmath45 read - rezayi states @xcite , one only has to change the root configuration to @xmath46 .",
    "interestingly , the root configurations correspond to the `` thin - torus '' limit of the states .",
    "@xcite    to describe spinful wave functions , the squeezing method was augmented in ref .  .",
    "the idea is to start with a root configuration , for which one at first ignores the spin degrees of freedom . to construct the reduced hilbert space ,",
    "one creates a set of orbital occupations , by squeezing in all possible ways . finally , one assigns spin to all the particles , in all possible ways .",
    "we will be interested in spin - singlet states , for which total @xmath8 is a good quantum number .",
    "so to construct the ground state , we work in the total @xmath47 sector . after distributing the spin in all possible ways for each configuration ,",
    "we have constructed the reduced hilbert space .",
    "the spinful orbital occupations are now denoted by @xmath48 .    we still have to specify how to obtain the correct wave function in the reduced hilbert space . in general , we will be interested in ground - state wave functions which have @xmath49 , so to obtain those , we work in the @xmath50 subsectors , and demand that the action of @xmath44 and @xmath51 on the state gives zero .",
    "it turns out that this is in general not enough to completely specify the wave functions .",
    "in addition , one has to demand that certain states in the reduced hilbert space have zero coefficient .",
    "the ssg is an example where this happens , as we shall presently describe .",
    "let us now discuss how the squeezing algorithm applies to the construction of the ssg hilbert space .",
    "we have already seen , in the construction of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eqhamiltonian ] ) , that the zero energy eigenstates of the ssg wave function vanish as at least a third power when three particles with the same spin are brought to the same point and , in addition , when three particles have overall spin @xmath18 , the wave functions vanish at least quadratically .",
    "these observations motivate the use of the root configurations based on the pattern @xmath52 , because like the moore ",
    "read state , the resulting wave function will vanish at least quadratically when three particles are at the same location .",
    "these root configurations have the property that two neighbouring orbitals can maximally be occupied by two particles , while five consecutive orbitals can be occupied by at most four particles .",
    "we note in advance that these root configurations satisfy the spinful generalized pauli principle , which we discuss in the next subsection .",
    "to construct the ground - state wave function , we start with the root configuration described above , and then construct the reduced hilbert space . to obtain the ground state",
    ", we then demand that both @xmath44 and @xmath51 act to give zero on all states in the reduced hilbert . this construction , however , only guarantees that the obtained wave function vanishes as a second power when three particles of the same spin are coincident ; but we really wanted the wave function to vanish as a third power in that case .",
    "we therefore enforce an additional constraint : that all basis states in the reduced hilbert space have zero coefficient , on the condition that either one has for spin - up particles @xmath53 and @xmath54 , or similarly , for spin - down particles , one has @xmath55 and @xmath56 . with that additional constraint",
    ", the wave function now vanishes as a third power when three particles are coincident with total @xmath17 .      a further method to characterize the zero energy space of the ssg hamiltonian is to use the generalized pauli principle for quantum hall wave functions .",
    "@xcite the generalized pauli principle is most readily expressed in terms of partitions ( or occupied orbitals ) .",
    "a partition @xmath57 is defined to be an ordered set of @xmath35 integers , \\{@xmath58 } , where @xmath59 .    to describe the hilbert space of spinless particles in flux @xmath30 , we restrict the integers to the set @xmath60 . we then have the following relation between the orbital occupation numbers @xmath61 , which were introduced in the previous subsection , and the @xmath62 forming the partition @xmath63 : namely , @xmath64 is the number of @xmath65 such that @xmath66 etc .",
    "thus in general , @xmath67 is the number of @xmath65 such that @xmath68 .    to characterize the quasiholes of the @xmath69 clustered states@xcite",
    "we introduce the notion of @xmath69-admissible partitions , which are partitions obeying the following condition for all @xmath65 : @xmath70    for given fixed values of @xmath35 and @xmath30 , one identifies the number of admissible partitions with the number of quasihole states in the corresponding spectrum . for instance",
    ", the @xmath71 series corresponds to the level-@xmath45 read  rezayi states , the laughlin state @xmath72 , and the moore  read state @xmath73 being the simplest cases .",
    "the gaffnian wave function is associated with the @xmath74 generalized pauli principle .    in order to generalize this method to the spinful case",
    ", we follow the argument presented in ref .  .",
    "first , the partition is replaced by a spinful partition that mixes momentum and spin .",
    "a spinful partition @xmath75 is specified by @xmath35 integers , \\{@xmath58 } , and now in addition , a set of spin indices @xmath76 , where @xmath77 . if either the condition @xmath78 or @xmath79 and @xmath80 holds , we say that @xmath75 constitutes a spinful partition .",
    "the spinful generalization of the @xmath69 admissible partitions is given by the following conditions , which have to hold for all @xmath65 : @xmath81    in ref .",
    "it is shown that the densest bosonic state that leads to a spinful @xmath69 admissible possible corresponds to a filling factor @xmath82 and a shift @xmath83 .",
    "note that on the sphere , the relation between the filling factor @xmath84 and shift @xmath15 is @xmath85    it has been proposed @xcite that nonsymmetric jack polynomials can represent spin - singlet states that are the spin generalization of the spinless clustered states . in that case , the root partition is chosen to be a spinful @xmath69 admissible partition .",
    "the number of quasihole states can be obtained in a similar way as the spinless case , counting the number of admissible partitions .",
    "indeed , these properties have been checked for the halperin spin - singlet states @xmath86 and the nass state @xmath87 . in our application of the spinful generalized pauli principle to the ssg",
    ", we employ the @xmath74 pauli principle ( as for the spin - polarized gaffnian ) , but now using the spinful partitions .",
    "in this section we shall present numerical evidence demonstrating that the zero energy states of the local hamiltonian presented in sec .",

    "[ secmethods ] .",

    "wave functions of this type were also considered in ref .  .",
    "presently we lack a corresponding cft description with which to conduct the same checks as for the ssg .",
    "it is also unclear at the present time whether that hilbert space could identically be constructed by a squeezing algorithm or generalized pauli principle approach .",
    "concerning cft coset constructions , it is noteworthy that we were able to derive a self - consistent cft from the product of two nonunitary minimal models by constructing a nondiagonal modular invariant .",
    "specifically , the nonunitary models in the product can be thought of as cosets of fractional level affine lie algebras .",

    "@xcite for nonunitary cosets , no such general procedure exists , and each cft must be constructed on a case - by - case basis . @xcite in the cft construction presented in this work , we have provided a further example of a case where the construction of non - diagonal modular invariants for nonunitary cfts is possible .",
    "another powerful tool for the analysis of the quantum hall wave functions has been the concept of jack polynomials .",
    "@xcite the jack polynomials provide a convenient basis in which to describe polynomial wave functions with precisely defined vanishing properties .",

    ", we will construct a modular invariant partition function of the product theory , using the boson condensation as a guiding principle .",
    "the first step of the procedure is to find a boson which can be condensed and to find the fields local with respect to that boson .",
    "such fields will be present in the final cft .",
    "upon acting with the boson on these fields , we obtain the fields ( in the original product theory ) which are identified with those fields which are local with respect to the boson . in this way",
    ", we can construct the modular invariant partition functions .",
    "we refer to refs .   for more details .",
    "we start with those cfts corresponding to wave functions with @xmath284 components , i.e. , the generalizations of the nass state , where the condensate particles have spin @xmath179 .",
    "the cft describing these states consists of a product of two minimal models , which , for @xmath285 , are nonunitary ( the case @xmath71 is the nass state ) .",
    "we already argued that for @xmath286 , the starting point is the product theory @xmath287 . for general @xmath288",
    ", we instead find that we need @xmath289 as the starting product theory .",
    "we note that for the minimal model theory @xmath115 to be well defined , @xmath290 and @xmath201 have to be co - prime , which means that @xmath291 .",
    "we will assume that this relation is satisfied from now on .",
    "the fields of the product theory will be labeled by @xmath292 , with the usual field identifications , coming from the field identifications present in the minimal model @xmath115 . in the product theory",
    ", the field @xmath293 always has scaling dimension @xmath294 , and hence is a boson . for @xmath71 , we find @xmath295 , the identity . for @xmath286",
    ", we have @xmath296 . for @xmath297",
    "( but @xmath291 ) , we find the general result @xmath298 .",
    "we now describe the field content of the cfts we employ in this paper , by specifying the relevant modular invariant partition functions . in general ,",
    "these are given in terms of the characters of the holomorphic and antiholomoriphic part of the cft .",
    "we will denote these characters by @xmath299 and @xmath300 , respectively , where both @xmath288 are @xmath301 are labels of the fields in the product cft .",
    "the putative partition functions take the form @xmath302 , where the @xmath303 are non - negative integers denoting the multiplicities of the holomorphic - antiholomorphic combination @xmath304",
    ". the identity field should be present and nondegenerate , @xmath305 . in order that the partition function is modular invariant ,",
    "the matrix @xmath5 should commute with both @xmath8 and @xmath306 , the generators of modular transformations .",
    "the commutation condition can be seen to enforce that the only combinations @xmath307 which can occur have @xmath308 .    the so - called diagonal invariant , @xmath309 always exists , but this is not the invariant we are interested in here .",
    "we are interested in the invariant , which contains @xmath310 fields , which are `` composed '' out of several fields , which are identified via the condensation of the boson present in the original product theory . to specify the invariants",
    ", we have to distinguish two cases separately .",
    "we start with @xmath288 odd . in this case",
    ", the fields in the final theory can be labeled by @xmath311 , for @xmath312 , and @xmath313 , for a total of @xmath310 fields .",
    "these fields are identified with the fields @xmath314 , with @xmath315 , i.e. , all possible odd values of the labels @xmath316 and @xmath317 . in particular",
    ", the modular invariant partition function takes the form      in the case that @xmath288 is even , the new theory still contains the fields which are labeled by @xmath319 , but the fields with labels @xmath320 are absent .",
    "instead , the fields with labels @xmath321 are now present . these are identified with the fields @xmath322 , where @xmath323 is even .",
    "the partition function reads @xmath324    we will now consider the case where the particles have @xmath325 internal states rather than 2 internal states as they do for spin @xmath179 . let us focus on the case @xmath326 , which would correspond to three - component states , such as the spin-1 states considered in refs .   .",
    "the generalization to higher @xmath325 will be clear after that . for @xmath326 ,",
    "the starting product theory is @xmath327 .",
    "the bosonic field which one can take as the field which condenses is @xmath328 , which has scaling dimension @xmath329 . as was the case for @xmath284",
    ", we need that @xmath291 , such that the factors in the product theory are well defined .",
    "starting with @xmath288 odd again , we can label the fields of the new ( block - diagonal ) modular invariant as follows .",
    "there are a few different groups , namely @xmath330 , with @xmath331 and @xmath332 , in addition to @xmath333 , also with @xmath331 and @xmath332 .",
    "the fields appearing in the blocks labeled by @xmath330 are @xmath334 , where @xmath335 . in the case of the blocks labeled by @xmath333 , the fields appearing in these blocks are @xmath334 , but now with @xmath336 and @xmath337 .    in the case that @xmath288 is even , the labels of the blocks are slightly different , in the same way as was the case for @xmath71 .",
    "there are for different types of labels , namely @xmath338 , @xmath339 , @xmath340 , and @xmath341 , all with @xmath332 .",
    "the fields appearing in these blocks are of the form @xmath334 , where @xmath342 and @xmath343 are either even or odd , depending on the type of block they belong to . in either case @xmath288 even or odd , the number of fields in the block - diagonal modular invariant is given by @xmath344 .    a few remarks about the case of general @xmath325 .",
    "the product theory one starts with is @xmath345 , where @xmath346 .",
    "the boson with scaling dimension @xmath347 has the labels @xmath348 .",
    "the number of different blocks , i.e. , the number of fields in the new modular invariant , is @xmath349 $ ] .",
    "the precise form of the labels of these blocks , and the fields appearing in them , depends on @xmath288 being even or odd , in a way which should be clear from the case @xmath326 above .",
    "the general form of the fields in the blocks is given by @xmath350 , where @xmath331 , @xmath351 $ ] , and @xmath352 can either be even or odd . for @xmath288 odd , @xmath342 is always odd , while for @xmath288 even we find that @xmath65 and @xmath342 have the same parity , @xmath353 .",
    "the invariants we discussed above are relevant for paired states with @xmath113 , based on particles with spin @xmath354 , with the property that the wave function vanishes as @xmath288 powers when three particles with the same @xmath355 come together .",
    "it is possible to generalize this construction to arbitrary clustered states with @xmath356 , but these will be based on cosets of the type @xmath357 , etc .",
    ", making the structure of the modular invariants somewhat more involved .",
