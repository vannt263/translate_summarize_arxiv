    "evolutionary game theory is nowadays a well established approach to model and study complex biological and ecological systems @xcite . of special importance",
    "are thereby spatial systems , as they give rise to novel and rich phenomena , ranging from the formation of complicated space - time patterns , in the form of spirals or cluster coarsening , to the emergence of nested ecological niches @xcite .",
    "most studies published in this context focused on spatial cyclic games with three @xcite or four species @xcite , but there have also been some attempts to generalize this to more complex networks with a larger number of species @xcite . in general ,",
    "these competition models assume that an agent will play a single strategy when confronted by another agent .",
    "the act of playing a single strategy is known in classical game theory as a pure strategy @xcite . in the literature on population and evolutionary dynamics a strategy is associated with a single species and/or genotype . depending upon the model dynamics a losing agent will either be removed completely or it will replace the losing strategy with the winning pure strategy .    in game theory , other than pure strategies",
    ", there is also the notion of mixed strategies @xcite .",
    "a mixed strategy is when at every interaction an agent picks and plays one of the possible pure strategies using a probability distribution .",
    "mixed strategies are sometimes encountered in nature @xcite , but can be seen most readily in social systems where decision making is important @xcite .",
    "economics is another area where game theory with either pure or mixed strategies has been studied .",
    "a series of economics papers focus on modifications of the three - species rock - paper - scissors model ( see , for example , @xcite ) , whereas others tie three - strategy cyclic domination to the public goods game @xcite .",
    "some papers discuss spatial games in an economics setting , but usually only games with two pure strategies ( prisoner s dilemma , snowdrift , hawk and dove ) are considered @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study versions of the cyclic three- and four - strategy games where agents are selecting a strategy from a time - dependent probability distribution .",
    "learning from a recent loss , an agent changes their probability distribution in such a way that it becomes less likely to play the losing strategy at the next interaction .",
    "as the emerging space - time properties in a spatial setting are of special interest , we focus in this work on agents that live on a one - dimensional lattice and only interact with their two nearest neighbors .",
    "some results are also presented for the well - mixed situation without an underlying spatial system .    in our implementation",
    "we describe every agent as an urn that contains @xmath0 balls of three respectively four different types , corresponding to the different pure strategies . at every interaction one of these @xmath0 balls",
    "is chosen randomly and the related strategy is played .",
    "if that strategy loses , the ball is replaced by a different ball representing the winning strategy . in that way",
    "the losing agent is less likely to play at the next interaction the losing strategy again .",
    "it should be noted that the value of @xmath0 is a measure of discretization of the probability distribution , with the limit @xmath1 yielding a continuous distribution . as we discuss in the following",
    ", changing the value of @xmath0 has a strong impact on the properties of systems with cyclic domination .",
    "for example , for the three - species strategies we observe a transition from a neutrally stable system to a stable system when increasing @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , in the limit of @xmath2 the system synchronizes , yielding spatially extended coherent temporal waves . when considering four strategies , one always has a neutrally stable system , but the average time for strategy extinction displays different regimes , depending on the value of @xmath0 and on the system size .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . in the next section we present our models in more detail .",
    "sections iii and iv are devoted to our results , first for the three - strategy case and then for the four - strategy model . in order to elucidate the properties of our mixed - strategy spatial systems with cyclic domination and a time - dependent probability distribution we study a range of quantities : time - dependent densities , space - time covariances and related length scales , and average times for strategy extinction .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section v.",
    "in the symmetric lotka - volterra model reactions are taking place with rate @xmath3 in a cyclic way between @xmath4 different species @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an agent of species @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and the cyclic identification @xmath9 . in the language of population dynamics , every species has one prey and is the prey of a single other species .",
    "the three - species case is special , as a reaction takes place whenever two agents of different types are selected . for cases with more than three species",
    "one has mutually neutral species that do not interact @xcite .",
    "cyclic lotka - volterra games can be played in the well - mixed case as well as on lattices where a variety of situations have been considered .",
    "for example , one can impose a strict site restriction with exactly one agent occupying each lattice site and reactions taking place between neighboring sites @xcite .",
    "this can be coupled with exchanges of agents sitting on nearest neighbor sites , in order to provide a mechanism for mobility @xcite .",
    "sometimes the site restriction is dropped so that every site can hold a variable number of agents that can diffuse and interact with agents on neighboring sites @xcite . in the related systems with may - leonard dynamics ,",
    "the reaction ( [ eq : lv ] ) is replaced by two separate reactions @xcite ( usually with different rates ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 indicates an empty site . in this scheme",
    "the number of agents in the system is a stochastic quantity that is only conserved on average .",
    "we consider in the following versions of the three- and four - strategy cyclic lotka - volterra game with mixed strategies where at every interaction agents play one of the possible strategies using a time - dependent probability distribution .",
    "imagine an agent as an urn that contains @xmath0 balls of three ( for the three - strategy version ) or four ( for the four - strategy case ) different types . for a well - mixed system without a lattice structure",
    "we first choose two agents / urns at random out of a total of @xmath12 agents / urns before choosing randomly a ball out of each selected urn . depending on the types of balls selected",
    ", a reaction may take place with rate @xmath13 following the scheme ( [ eq : lv ] ) .",
    "if the strategy played by one of the agents is beaten , then the losing ball is replaced by a ball of the winning type before the balls are put back into the urns .",
    "the losing agent therefore changes the probability distribution as a result of the loss by increasing ( decreasing ) the probability to play the winning ( losing ) strategy at the next interaction . for a spatial game",
    "we only consider the case with exactly one agent at every lattice site . in order to start an interaction we select an agent and one of their neighbors at random and then proceed as for the well - mixed case . in our simulations",
    "we define one time step to be @xmath14 proposed updates .",
    "one can view this scheme in a spatial setting as a version of the spatial cyclic lotka - volterra model with multiple occupancy of each site , but there are important differences . in the model discussed in @xcite in the context of population dynamics ,",
    "individuals not only interact with agents on other lattice sites , they also diffuse by jumping with a given probability to one of the neighboring sites . as a result",
    "the number of individuals at each site fluctuates and only the average spatial density is constant . in our case ,",
    "only interactions take place so that the number of balls at each site ( which corresponds to the number of individuals at a given site in the model of @xcite ) is strictly conserved .",
    "as we will see in the following , this additional conservation law has a huge impact on the properties of our system .",
    "as already mentioned , the situation with three strategies is rather special , as every time two different strategies are played , there will be a losing and a winning strategy . in the following",
    "we show , both in the well - mixed case as well as on the ring , that for continuous probability distributions a synchronization of the strategies played by the different agents takes place . for small number of balls per agent a transition in the stability properties of the lattice system",
    "is observed .",
    "we first consider the mixed three - strategies game in a well - mixed system without spatial structure .",
    "agent @xmath15 is characterized by the number of balls of each type at their possession : @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of balls of type @xmath19 .",
    "the state of the system of @xmath12 agents is then given by the number of balls of each type in possession of each agent , i.e. by the configuration @xmath20    the interaction scheme ( [ eq : lv ] ) rates @xmath21 directly translates into the following master equation for the probability that the system is in state @xmath22 at time @xmath23 .",

    "this is adequate as the percentage of @xmath97 is readily obtained from the fact that the sum over all four densities is 1 .",

    "[ fig6 ] . for @xmath101",
    "we see the formation of regions dominated by neutral pairs ( red and blue vs green and black ) . as there is no mechanism for mobility , red and blue ( green and black ) single - species regions become stuck within one another , forming superdomains of neutral partners @xcite . as a result",
    "a winning strategy can invade the region of a losing strategy only until it hits a patch occupied by the partner strategy of the losing strategy .",
    "this results in the zig - zag like structures where the different strategies ( in the order red , black , blue , green ) dominate one after the other over a region of the lattice .",
    "these regions grow in extent after each change of strategy , yielding ultimately a lattice occupied by only one of the partnerships ( either red and blue or green and black ) .",
    "as we increase @xmath0 , domains of neutral pairs become effectively mixed , and a third strategy has a higher probability to invade a superdomain occupied by a given alliance .",
    "this results in a much slower growth of the neutral pair domains . further increasing @xmath0",
    "causes the neutral species pairs to become very well mixed , resulting in two types of neutral - species domains that overall look purple and dark green .",
    "these neutral - species domains continue to compete against each other , yielding a slow coarsening process . within these coarsening domains",
    "cyclic processes continue unabated , as revealed by the appearance of localized wave patterns for very large @xmath0 , see fig .",
    "these waves are very much like those encountered in the three - species case , albeit of smaller extent , only that now one cycles through four types of balls instead of three .    for a more quantitative discussion we turn again to the space - time covariance of the form @xmath102 which yields the self - covariance if the species @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the same ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : cov ] ) ) and the cross - covariance otherwise .",
    "we then define an _",
    "individual _ spatial covariance through the equation @xmath105 a different spatial covariance can be obtained when we do not distinguish anymore between neutral strategies but consider them to form a unique group , i.e. strategies @xmath19 and @xmath30 together form the group denoted by @xmath106 , whereas @xmath29 and @xmath97 make up the group @xmath107 .",
    "we call the space - time covariance for these larger groups @xmath108 the _ neutral _ spatial covariance . from these two quantities",
    "we can extract two different time - dependent length scales , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , that provide some insights into the ordering of the superdomains formed by neutral partners .",

    "title=\"fig : \" ]    fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the time evolution of these two lengths for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "let us first look at the pure case with @xmath121 , as we can compare for this case our lengths with those discussed previously in the literature . as shown by frachebourg",
    "et al @xcite one needs to consider two different types of domains for the four - species lotka - volterra model with immobile particles on a one - dimensional chain : the pure domains occupied by a single species and the superdomains shared by two non - interacting species .",
    "starting from a fully disordered state , the pure domains increase as @xmath122 , whereas the superdomain size , i.e. the distance between active interfaces , is proportional to @xmath123 . as seen in panel ( a ) , for the case @xmath121 both lengths @xmath109 and @xmath110 provide essentially the same information on the superdomains : they are proportional and both display an algebraic increase with an exponent 2/3 before saturating due to finite - size effects .",
    "increasing @xmath0 yields a slowing down of the coarsening process as manifested by a gradual decrease of the exponent governing the growth of the two lengths . for @xmath115 , for example , the effective exponent before the transition to the saturation regime is close to 0.45 , see panel ( b ) .",
    "this decrease of the exponent describing the long - time regime before saturation continues when further increasing @xmath0 , with a value of 0.14 for @xmath124 and 0.05 for @xmath125 , see panels ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "this very slow increase for large @xmath0 is not size - dependent and should therefore not be confused with the finite - size plateau seen for example in ( a ) for @xmath101 .",
    "the very weak increase of the correlation length for large @xmath0 and large @xmath126 instead indicates that domain growth almost comes to a standstill due to strong mixing effects . interestingly , for large @xmath0 this long - term regime is preceded by another regime where @xmath119 increases as a square - root of time ( indicated by the red segments in ( c ) and ( d ) ) , whereas @xmath118 displays some non - trivial features that reflect the complicated ordering processes seen in the space - time plots .",
    "we tentatively identify this regime with the initial formation and growth of the neutral - species superdomains followed by a coarsening process where essentially only two types of domains compete against each other .",
    "[ h ]   ( color online ) average lattice domination time as a function of the total number of balls @xmath64 in the system .",
    "each data point results from an average over 2000 runs , the standard error being smaller than the sizes of the symbols . , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "another way to characterize these systems is through the study of lattice domination events . the lattice domination time shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] is the mean number of time steps needed until only one neutral species pair remains in the system .",
    "interestingly , different regimes also show up in the lattice domination time when changing the value of @xmath0 . for @xmath101 ,",
    "i.e. the case of pure strategies , the lattice domination time increases with the system size as @xmath127 @xcite , making this a neutrally stable system . increasing @xmath0",
    "slightly changes the exponent ( for @xmath55 its value is 1.68 ) , but has no other effect on the lattice domination time . for @xmath128 ,",
    "however , different regimes emerge as a function of the system size , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8]a . plotting the lattice domination time against the total number of balls in the system , @xmath14 , reveals a first regime where the lattice domination time increases algebraically with an exponent close to 2 .",
    "this is followed by a crossover to a second algebraic regime with a much larger exponent ( for example , for @xmath117 the exponent is 5.60 ) . for @xmath0",
    "not too large , this crossover takes place at rather similar values of @xmath14 , i.e. the larger @xmath0 is , the smaller the needed system size is to enter the second algebraic regime . fig .",
    "[ fig8]b displays another change of behavior for values of @xmath129 , as the crossover is then shifted to larger values of @xmath14 when increasing @xmath0 .",
    "for the smaller sizes , i.e. before the crossover , the data for different @xmath0 values fall on one common curve with an exponent of approximately 1.5 .",
    "the emergence of two regimes in the lattice domination time for @xmath128 can be related to different types of extinction events linked to the prevailing domain structure . on the one hand , in small systems",
    "extinction can take place at rather short times since the preparation of the system , due to the formation of a few superdomains followed by a coarsening of these domains . for larger @xmath12",
    "many such domains are formed , resulting in complicated processes dominated by triangular ( zig - zag ) space - time patterns as those seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6]b for @xmath130 .",
    "this periodic cycling through triangles of all four ball types yields a very slow coarsening process .",
    "a further increase of @xmath0 results in the replacement in this second regime of the triangular structures by very long - lived wave patterns , due to some spatially localized synchronization , that dominate the purplish and dark green domains in fig .",
    "domains grow very slowly in that regime , see the late - time behavior of the growth length shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7]d , and extinction events are only encountered at very late times .    in @xcite we showed for the four - species model with pure strategies ( @xmath121 ) that much can be learned about extinction events when studying the probability distribution of the lattice domination time .",
    "we expect this to be also true for the more complicated cases with @xmath0 large .",
    "however , the extremely large values of the domination times make it impossible with the resources at our disposal to perform enough runs for a reliable computation of this probability distribution .",
    "systems composed of multiple species that interact in a cyclic way have been at the center of a multitude of studies in recent years . mostly discussed in the context of evolutionary game theory and population dynamics ,",
    "these systems allow to understand some of the generic properties arising from non - trivial interactions in ecological systems .",
    "in this paper we discussed a version of the three- and four - species lotka - volterra model where the agents are using a mixed strategy , i.e. agents play a pure strategy using a probability distribution every time they interact .",
    "taking into account that agents , both in ecology and economics , tend to learn from past experience , we consider time - dependent probability distributions where a losing agent decreases the probability to play a losing strategy at the next interaction . in order to do so , we treat an agent as an urn containing @xmath0 balls of three respectively four types , where each type corresponds to one of the three respectively four strategies .",
    "if a strategy loses , a ball of the corresponding type is replaced by a ball with the winning strategy .",
    "the number of balls @xmath0 in the urn therefore measures the level of discretization of the probability distribution , with the limit @xmath1 corresponding to a continuous distribution .",
    "as our study revealed , some remarkable changes take place when changing the level of discretization .",
    "for the three - strategy case on a one - dimensional lattice we observe a transition between neutrally stable for @xmath131 , where the average time needed for one strategy to completely pervade the system grows algebraically with the system size due to coarsening of single domains , to stable for @xmath132 , where this time increases exponentially with the extent of the system , thus indicating the existence of a stable attractor in the coexistence region .",
    "this transition gives rise to a change of space - time patterns and the emergence of a tiling structure where strategies dominate for a finite amount of time over certain regions of the lattice . in the limit @xmath2 ,",
    "when the probability distribution approximates a continuous distribution , this tiling structure evolves into spatially extended waves where the dominating strategies changes periodically .",
    "synchronization throughout the system is also encountered in the case without spatial dependence and can be understood in the mean - field limit of an infinite number of agents using continuous probability distributions by analyzing the corresponding rate equations . comparing our three strategy results to those found in @xcite for a related multi occupancy model , we find much richer dynamics and a transition in the stability properties of fully occupied lattices when changing the occupancy parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the four - strategy case is characterized by the existence of pairs of non - interacting strategies . as a result agents in a spatial setting with @xmath121 want to ally themselves with agents that play the complementary strategy in order to fight off the competing pair of strategies .",
    "a direct consequence of this rivalry between competing alliances is the formation and coarsening of superdomains occupied by a single alliance .",
    "in contrast to the three - strategy case , an increase of @xmath0 does not yield a stable system .",
    "instead , the mean lattice domination time , i.e. the average time needed for one alliance to completely fill the system , always increases algebraically with @xmath14 .",
    "still , different regimes can be identified as a function of @xmath12 and @xmath0 .",
    "for example for large values of these parameters a very slow coarsening process is observed , with local synchronized waves within the competing domains .    besides some results for the well - mixed case without spatial setting , we focus in this paper on the one - dimensional lattice . it is well known from cases with @xmath121 that the dimensionality of the lattice can have a huge impact on the properties of the system .",
    "taking into account the already complex behavior observed in our study of the ring , we expect the appearance of additional intriguing features , especially for the four - strategy case , when considering systems with time - dependent probability distributions in two space dimensions .",
    "in our paper we only considered immobile agents .",
    "this is of course not a realistic description for ecological systems . for the lotka - volterra type models considered here",
    ", mobility can be implemented through the swapping of agents occupying neighboring lattice sites .",
    "it would be interesting to see how the different regimes are modified when allowing for exchanges of agents .",
    "we expect to come back to that question in the future .",
    "we have restricted us to the simple three- and four - species lotka - volterra models with time - dependent probability distribution , as for these situations the properties for the case @xmath101 are well understood and provide a case against which we can study changes that emerge when using a time - dependent probability distribution to play a strategy .",
    "recently there has been a strong focus on more complicated situations , with more species and/or more complex interaction schemes .",
    "it is an interesting question how the properties of these systems change when considering a mixed strategy game with a time - dependent probability distribution .",
