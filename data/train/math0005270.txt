    "the notions of @xmath0-hemimetrics and @xmath0-partition hemimetrics are generalizations of the notions of metrics and cuts , which are well - known and central objects in graph theory , combinatorial optimization and , more generally , discrete mathematics .",
    "obviously the @xmath0-hemimetrics on an @xmath1-element set @xmath4 form a cone .",
    "what are its facets and extreme rays ?",
    "the calculations are rather complex due to the high dimension , @xmath5 , of the cone even for small @xmath1 ; moreover , matrices can no longer be used .",
    "recall that a _",
    "metric _ or a _ metric space _ is a pair @xmath6 where @xmath4 is a nonvoid set and @xmath7(the set of nonnegative reals ) satisfies for all @xmath8 : + ( d1 ) @xmath9 , + ( d2 ) @xmath10(symmetry ) , + ( d3 ) @xmath11(the triangle inequality ) .",
    "a basic example is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the euclidean distance of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; i.e. , the length of the segment joining @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "an immediate extension is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the area of the triangle with vertices @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this leads to the following definition ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a 2-_metric _ is a pair @xmath6 , where @xmath4 is a nonempty set and @xmath20 satisfies for all @xmath21 + ( d1@xmath22 ) @xmath23 , + ( d1@xmath24 ) @xmath25 for some @xmath26 , + ( d2 ) @xmath17 is totally symmetric , + ( d3 ) @xmath27  ( the tetrahedron inequality ) .",
    "the axiom ( d2 ) means that the value of @xmath28 is independent of the order of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the axiom ( d3 ) captures that fact that in @xmath29 the area of a triangle face of a tetrahedron does not exceed the sum of the areas of the remaining three faces .",
    "a 2-metric allows the introduction of several geometrical and topological concepts ",
    "e.g. the betweenness , convexity , line and neighborhood  which lead to interesting results",
    ".    for finite 2-metrics ( the object of this study ) , for their polyhedral aspects and for applications , the axiom ( d1@xmath22 ) and ( d1@xmath24 ) seem to be too restrictive and so we drop them . the definition given below",
    "is formulated for an arbitrary positive integer @xmath0 .",
    "a map @xmath30 is _ totally symmetric _ if for all @xmath31 and every permutation @xmath32 of @xmath33@xmath34    * definition .",
    "* let @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath0-hemimetric _ is a pair @xmath6 , where @xmath36 is totally symmetric and satisfies the _ simplex inequality _ : for all @xmath37@xmath38@xmath39    call a @xmath0-hemimetric @xmath13 _ nonnegative _ if @xmath13 takes only nonnegative values .",
    "the notion of a @xmath0-hemimetric is new , but it is closely related to the notion of a @xmath0-metric , considered in about 200 references collected in @xcite .",
    "the study of @xmath0-hemimetrics is motivated ( apart , of course , that it represents an extension of metrics ) by applications in statistics and data analysis ( see @xcite for some relevant references ) .",
    "notice the following immediate :    * fact 1 .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath47 is a nonnegative @xmath0-hemimetric and for @xmath53 it is the usual _ cut _ semimetric ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    for small values of @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    "we consider the cone of all @xmath0-hemimetrics , the cone of all nonnegative @xmath0-hemimetrics and the cone , generated by all partition @xmath0-hemimetrics on @xmath54 .",
    "using computer search we list facets and generators for these cones and tables of their adjacencies and incidences .",
    "the different orbits were determined manually , using symmetries .",
    "we study two graphs , the @xmath55-skeleton and the ridge graph , of these polyhedra : the number of their nodes and edges , their diameters , conditions of adjacency , inclusions among the graphs and their restrictions on some orbits of nodes .",
    "in fact , we would like to describe two graphs @xmath56 for our three cones as fully as possible , but in the cases , when it is too difficult , we will give some partial information on adjacencies in those graphs .",
    "especially we are interested in the diameters of the graphs , in a good criterion of adjacency , in their local graphs ( i.e. in the subgraphs induced by all neighbors of a given vertex ) and in their restrictions on some orbits .",
    "finally , we compare obtained results with similar results for metric case ( see  @xcite ) and quasi - metric case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "all computation was done using the programs _ cdd _ of  @xcite .",
    "the following notation will be used below :    * the _",
    "( m+1)-simplex _ inequality ( 1 ) and , in particular , for @xmath57 , the _ tetrahedron _ inequality + @xmath58 ; * the _ nonnegativity _ inequality @xmath59 ; * the _ cone @xmath60 of partition m - hemimetrics _ , generated by all @xmath44-partitions of @xmath54 ; * the _ cone @xmath61 of nonnegative m - hemimetrics _ , defined by all + @xmath62@xmath5 @xmath44-simplex inequalities and all @xmath5 nonnegativity inequalities on @xmath54 ; * the _ cone of all m - hemimetrics _ , @xmath63 , defined by all @xmath44-simplex inequalities on @xmath54",
    ".    clearly , @xmath64 and these 3 cones are of full dimension @xmath5 each .",
    "for @xmath53 the last two cones coincide and the first two cones are the _ cut cone @xmath65 _ and the _ semimetric cone @xmath66 _ , considered in detail in @xcite and in the references listed there .",
    "the cone @xmath67 has @xmath68 orbits of extreme rays ( represented by the cuts @xmath69 ) .    to simplify the notation we keep @xmath1 fixed and",
    "denote by @xmath70 the family of all @xmath71-element subsets of @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "let @xmath13 be a semimetric on the set @xmath72 .",
    "because of symmetry ( d2 ) and since @xmath74 for all @xmath75 , we can view the semimetric @xmath13 as a vector @xmath76 . in the same way , we can view the @xmath0-hemimetric @xmath13 on the set @xmath72 as a vector @xmath77 . in particular , each extreme ray of the cones , considered below , will be represented by an integer vector on the ray with relatively prime coordinates .",
    "we also will represent the facets of cones by such vectors .",
    "any such vector @xmath78 can be represented by the following vertex - labeled induced subgraph @xmath79 of the johnson graph @xmath80 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath79 are all unordered @xmath44-tuples @xmath81 such that @xmath82 is not zero",
    ". this value will be the label of the vertex ; we will omit the label when it is 1 .",
    "two vertices of the johnson graph ( and also of its induced subgraph @xmath79 ) are adjacent if the corresponding @xmath44-tuples have @xmath0 common elements .    for example",
    ", @xmath83 is the complement to the hamming graph @xmath84 , i.e. the direct ( cartesian ) product of the cliques @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "another example : the graph @xmath87 of the vector defining a nonnegativity facet is a vertex and , for a @xmath44-simplex facet , it is the complete graph @xmath88 with one vertex labeled @xmath89 .",
    "recall that for a partition @xmath90 of @xmath54 the cut semimetric @xmath91 satisfies @xmath92 if @xmath93 is a singleton and @xmath94 otherwise . we extend it as follows .",
    "let @xmath95 be an integer and let @xmath96 be pairwise disjoint nonvoid subsets of @xmath72 , forming a partition of @xmath72 .",

    "the cone generated by all multicut semimetrics @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) on @xmath72 , is called _ the multicut cone _ and denoted by @xmath111 ; it coincides with @xmath112 ( see @xcite , proposition 4.2.9 ) .",
    "the convex hull of the cut semimetrics ( multicut semimetrics ) on @xmath72 , is called the _ cut polytope _ ( _ multicut polytope _ ) and is denoted by @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) ; the two polytopes not coincide .",
    "we recall some terminology .",
    "let @xmath115 be a polyhedral cone in @xmath116 .",
    "given @xmath117 , the inequality @xmath118 is said to be _",
    "valid _ for @xmath115 , if it holds for all @xmath119 .",
    "then the set @xmath120 is called the _ face of @xmath115 , induced by the valid inequality @xmath121_. a face of dimension @xmath122 is called a _ facet _ of @xmath115 ; a face of dimension @xmath55 is called an _ extreme ray _ of @xmath115 . a face of dimension @xmath123 is called a _ ridge_.    two vertices @xmath18 of @xmath115 are said to be _ adjacent _ , if they generate a face of dimension 2 of @xmath115 .",

    "denote by @xmath125 the dual cone of @xmath115 .",
    "the _ ridge graph _ of @xmath115 is the graph whose nodes are the facets of @xmath115 and with an edge between two facets if they are adjacent on @xmath115 .",
    "so , the ridge graph of a cone @xmath115 is the @xmath55-skeleton @xmath126 of its dual cone .",
    "a mapping @xmath127 is called a _ symmetry _ of a cone @xmath115 ( or a polytope @xmath128 ) , if it is an isometry , satisfying @xmath129 ( or @xmath130 ) .",
    "( _ an isometry _ of @xmath116 is a linear mapping preserving the euclidean distance . ) given a face @xmath131 , the _ orbit _ @xmath132 of @xmath131 consists of all faces , that can be obtained from @xmath131 by the group of all symmetries of @xmath115 .",
    "clearly , all the faces of @xmath112 and @xmath113 are preserved by any permutation of @xmath54 . for @xmath133",
    "all orbits of faces of @xmath0-hemimetric cones @xmath134 on @xmath72 are also preserved under any permutation of the set @xmath135 .",
    "we conjecture that the symmetry group consists only of permutations of @xmath54 , i.e. it is the group @xmath136 of all permutations on @xmath54 ( see theorem 3.3 in @xcite stating that the symmetry group of a truncated multicut polytope is @xmath136 ) .",
    "the minimal @xmath1 for which the three cones are nontrivial is @xmath138 ; the dimension of the cones is also @xmath138 for @xmath137 .",

    "it turns out that @xmath140 .",

    "each extreme ray ( say , @xmath150 ) is incident to 2 tetrahedron and to 2 nonnegativity facets ( namely , to @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) .",
    "the ridge graph @xmath126 is the cube .",
    "adjacencies of facets of @xmath153 are shown in table [ tab : tabl1 ] .",
    "for each orbit a representative and the number of adjacent facets from other orbits are given , as well as the total number of adjacent ones , the number of incident extreme rays and the cardinality of orbits .",
