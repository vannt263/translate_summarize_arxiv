    "the recent observations of large elliptic flow  @xcite and energy loss of high energy partons in the medium  @xcite strongly suggest the formation of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , a hot and dense state of quarks and gluons , in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions . the results from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) during the last decade as well as the recent results from the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite are consistent with theoretical calculations which assume early thermalization and a nearly ideal fluid behaviour of the system .",
    "the evolution of the system from initial formation to final breakup is reflected in various different observables .",
    "electromagnetic radiation has long been proposed as the most promising and efficient probe to characterize the initial state of the hot and dense matter produced in the collisions  @xcite . unlike bulk hadrons , which are emitted from the freeze - out hyper - surface , photons come out from every phase of the expanding fireball , suffer negligible final state interactions ( since electromagnetic coupling @xmath2 strong coupling @xmath3 ) , and carry undistorted information about the medium conditions at their production points .",
    "the thermal emission of photons from the evolving system shows a very strong temperature dependence : the high @xmath4 photons are emitted mostly from the hot and dense early stages of matter when the hydrodynamic flow is weak , whereas those at lower @xmath4 are emitted from the relatively cold later parts of the system where a large build - up of radial flow boosts their transverse momentum .",
    "thermal photons with @xmath5@xmath1 , are therefore expected to provide a glimpse of the early part of the expansion history when the fireball is in the plasma phase , complementary to the spectra of bulk hadrons which reflect the late conditions close to decoupling .",
    "initially direct photon spectra were studied mostly to extract the temperature of the system . in recent times ,",
    "several other photon observables have shown significantly more potential to understand the dynamics of the system , for example , intensity interferometry of photons for space time information of the evolving system  @xcite , momentum anisotropy of the initial partons as well as formation time of qgp from elliptic flow of thermal photons  @xcite , study of jet - quenching through photons produced from jet medium interaction  @xcite etc .",
    "in addition to that , a higher level of sophistication has been reached in the estimation of prompt photons from next to leading order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd calculations  @xcite where the result explains the direct photon spectrum from p+p collisions at rhic quite well for @xmath6 gev/@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "also photons from jet - plasma interaction , investigated in detail recently  @xcite , have been suggested as an important contribution to the direct photon yield at @xmath7 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "ideal hydrodynamics with a smooth initial density profile has been used successfully to model the evolution of the system at rhic where the experimental data for hadron spectra and elliptic flow are well reproduced up to @xmath8 gev/@xmath1 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . however , for any given event there are inhomogeneities in the initial energy density profile and therefore event - by - event fluctuating density profiles are more realistic than a smooth initial density distribution .",
    "thus , the important question is whether these event - by - event fluctuating initial conditions ( ic ) have any sizable effect on the physical observables if they are computed by averaging over many final states rather than considering an averaged initial density profile .",
    "it has been shown recently that hydrodynamics with event - by - event fluctuating ic reproduces the experimental charged particle elliptic flow even for the most central collisions at rhic  @xcite which was underestimated by all earlier hydrodynamic calculations using smooth ic .",
    "several other studies have shown that fluctuating ic give a better agreement with the experimental charged particle spectra at high @xmath4 by increasing the number of particles there  @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations may also help to understand the various structures observed in two - particle correlations  @xcite .",
    "since thermal photons are sensitive to the initial temperature , they are especially suitable for probing fluctuations in the ic .    thermal radiation is predicted to be the dominant source of direct photons in the range @xmath9 gev/@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "photon results using smooth profile and latest rates  @xcite fall , however , well below the experimental data points ( see fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) in this @xmath4 range . in the present work we report a substantial @xmath4 dependent enhancement in the production of thermal photons for @xmath10 gev/@xmath1 with an event - by - event fluctuating ic relative to a smooth initial - state averaged profile in the ideal hydrodynamic calculation . consequently",
    ", our results with fluctuating density profile show a better agreement with the phenix experimental data for @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "however it is to be noted that the main aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of initial state fluctuations on the production of thermal photons rather than explaining the experimental direct photon spectrum , which contains significant contributions from other sources apart from thermal radiation . also importantly",
    ", we find that the enhancement scales with the initial fluctuation size .",
    "we use the event - by - event hydrodynamical model developed in  @xcite , which has been applied successfully to study the elliptic flow with fluctuating initial states .",
    "the standard two - parameter woods - saxon nuclear density profile is used to randomly distribute the nucleons in the colliding nuclei .",
    "two nucleons @xmath11 and @xmath12 from different nuclei are then assumed to collide whenever they satisfy the relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section at @xmath15 gev , and @xmath16 denote the positions of the nucleons in the transverse plane .",
    "the initial density profile is taken to be proportional to the number of wounded nucleons ( wn ) , where entropy density @xmath17 ( or the energy density @xmath18 ) is distributed in the @xmath19 plane around the wounded nucleons using a 2d gaussian as a size function , @xmath20 ( x , y ) = \\frac{k}{2 \\pi \\sigma^2 } \\sum_{i=1}^{\\ n_{\\rm wn } } \\exp \\big ( -\\frac{(x - x_i)^2+(y - y_i)^2}{2 \\sigma^2 } \\big ) .",

    "the parameter @xmath21 is a fixed overall normalization constant and @xmath22 is a free parameter determining the size of the fluctuations .",
    "the effective interaction radius for the colliding nucleons , @xmath23 0.6  fm , sets a natural order of magnitude for the size parameter . similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite , the default value of @xmath22 is taken as 0.4 fm , however we test the sensitivity of the results to @xmath22 by varying @xmath22 from 0.4 to 1.0 fm .",
    "we consider the 020% most central au+au collisions where the value of @xmath24 fluctuates from 391 to 197 according to the monte carlo glauber model .",
    "this corresponds to an average impact parameter of about 4.4 fm .    using this procedure we thus find intra - event fluctuations ( i.e. hotspots and holes ) in the ic in a given event , as well as inter - event fluctuations in the total entropy between any two events .",
    "we call events with larger than average entropy production `` hot events '' and those with smaller than average entropy production `` cold events '' .    for au+au collisions at @xmath15",
    "gev the constant @xmath21 is taken as @xmath25 for the swn ( ewn ) profile , which reproduces the initial total entropy of ref .",
    "@xcite when averaging over many initial states in central collisions for @xmath26 . as in  @xcite , the initial time",
    "is fixed at @xmath27 fm/@xmath1 motivated by the ekrt minijet saturation model  @xcite for all the events .",
    "assuming longitudinal boost invariance , we solve the ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional ideal hydrodynamic equations using the shasta algorithm @xcite which is able to propagate shock waves possible with the irregular ic .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) which shows a sharp crossover transition from plasma phase to hadronic matter is taken from  @xcite . the temperature for freeze - out",
    "is taken as 160 mev , which reproduces the measured @xmath4 spectrum of pions  @xcite well for both the profiles ewn and swn .",
    "the rate of thermal photon production in the qgp depends on the momentum distribution of the partons which are governed by the thermodynamical conditions of the matter .",
    "the quark - gluon compton scattering and quark - anti - quark annihilation are the leading order processes for photon production in the partonic phase , whereas in next to leading order , bremsstrahlung process contributes significantly to the production  @xcite . in a hot hadronic gas at a temperature of the order of pion mass , @xmath28 and @xmath29 mesons",
    "contribute dominantly to the photon production because of the low mass of pions and the large spin iso - spin degeneracy of @xmath29 mesons , making them the most easily accessible particles in the medium  @xcite .",
    "the leading photon producing channels involving @xmath28 and @xmath29 mesons are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "we use the rates @xmath33 of  @xcite for the plasma and those of  @xcite for the hadronic matter which at present can be considered as the state of the art .",
    "the transition from the plasma rates to the hadronic rates is assumed to happen at a temperature of 170 mev in this study .",
    "the total thermal emission from the quark and hadronic matter phases are obtained by integrating the emission rates over the space - time history of the fireball as @xmath34\\,d^4x\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 .",

    "fm here . also shown",
    "are the hadronic contributions for the smooth ic cases.,width=287 ]",
    "we compare our results from smooth and fluctuating swn initial density profiles with phenix data for 020% centrality bin in fig .",
    "the smooth initial density profile here is obtained by taking an average of 1000 fluctuating initial profiles which is enough to remove essentially all fluctuations . to test whether there is a residual dependence on the ic averaging procedure we vary the value of @xmath22 from 0.4 to 1.0 fm .",
    "the thermal photon spectrum from the resulting smooth initial density profiles is almost independent of @xmath22 in the low @xmath4 region . only at high @xmath4 ( @xmath46 gev/@xmath1 )",
    ", a change in the value of @xmath22 from 0.4 to 1.0 decreases the photon production there by 2030% .",
    "photons from the fluctuating ic scenario are estimated by averaging photon spectra from sufficiently large number of random events .",
    "we make sure that addition of another very hot or very cold event does not change the results significantly .",
    "we find that in the entire @xmath4 range the spectra are dominated by the qgp radiation both for the smooth as well as for the fluctuating ic .",
    "this is not due to our choice of large freeze - out temperature @xmath47 ( 160 mev ) : we have checked that a prolonged hydro evolution towards a smaller value like @xmath48 120 mev contributes significantly below 1.5 gev/@xmath1 but is not substantial for @xmath49 2 gev/@xmath1 , as shown by the brown dashed dotted line in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "photons from ( only ) the hadronic phase are shown by dotted and short dashed gray lines for @xmath47 values of 160 and 120 mev respectively for the smooth ic .",
    "both these lines fall well below the plasma and the total contribution .",
    "it is to be noted that a bag model eos produces more hadronic photons near the transition region compared to a lattice based eos , however the contribution from the hadronic phase is not significant for @xmath7 gev/@xmath1 even for a bag model eos .",
    "we also note that the bag model yield of photons at high @xmath4 is about 50 % smaller than the results shown in here .     as a function of the fluctuation size parameter @xmath22.,width=272 ]    the slope of the photon spectrum from the fluctuating ic is about 10% flatter compared to the slope from the smooth one in the region @xmath50 gev/@xmath1 and the two results differ almost by a factor of 2 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) for @xmath7 gev/@xmath1 . in the region",
    "@xmath51 gev/@xmath1 , the fluctuating case produces 2040% more photons than the smooth profile . the thermal emission of photons is exponential in temperature and linear in radiating volume . as a result , the hotspots in the fluctuating events produce more high @xmath4 photons compared to the smooth profile . on the other hand ,",
    "the low @xmath4 part of the spectrum comes from the relatively cold more volume - dominated later plasma stage , where the emission is not affected significantly due to the change in the ic .",
    "thus the difference between the two profiles is small near @xmath52 gev/@xmath1 and enhanced towards higher @xmath4 .",
    "it may be noted that a similar enhancement of the thermal photon production by a factor @xmath53 in the region @xmath54 gev/@xmath1 using the same smooth ic can also be obtained by choosing a smaller initial time @xmath55 . in this case , one needs to reduce the the value of @xmath55 to half of its original value  @xcite .",
    "a systematic study of thermal photons at different centrality bins has the potential to distinguish between the effects of fluctuations in the initial state and the formation time .",
    "similar to the photon results , hardening of the spectra is observed also for hadrons where the fluctuation - driven radial flow makes their spectra harder compared to the spectra obtained from a smooth ic .",
    "this is because the hadrons are emitted from the much later stage of the system expansion , i.e. the surface of freeze - out  @xcite . for photons , the difference between the fluctuating and the smooth ic is an early time effect ( due to the presence of hotspots ) when the radial flow is still very small .",
    "although the photons from the late hadronic phase are affected significantly due to the increased radial flow in the fluctuating ic , the sum spectrum , which is dominated by plasma radiation in the entire @xmath4 range , remains almost unaffected .",
    "thus , the production of thermal photons shows a very strong dependence on the averaging procedure . we observe that the results for fluctuating ic show better agreement with the experimental data compared to earlier studies with smooth initial profile while leaving enough space for the prompt contribution and jet conversion photons",
    "this may also affect the photon elliptic flow results  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the results to the fluctuation size parameter @xmath22 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the ratio of the results from fluctuating and smooth ic are plotted as a function of @xmath22 for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "the enhancement is maximal for higher values of @xmath4 and lower values of @xmath22 which clearly shows the dominance of the hotspots in high @xmath4 photon production . for @xmath56 fm , profiles with fluctuating ic do not show pronounced differences to the smooth case as the ratio approaches 1 .    , ( b ) 3 gev/@xmath1 , and ( c ) 5 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "results are compared with an initial state averaged event and four different random events.,width=272 ]    we also notice that the photon results are quite sensitive to the initial profiles ; the results for swn are harder than those with the ewn .",
    "the entropy initialization leads to more pronounced maxima in the energy density distribution ( causing hotter initial state and harder spectra ) than their energy initialization counterparts which was observed in some earlier studies also  @xcite .",
    "however , the photon spectrum from fluctuating ic considering the ewn profile shows a similar enhancement relative to the smooth profile as observed for swn in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the time evolution of the photon results for smooth ( solid lines ) and fluctuating ( dashed lines ) ic are shown at @xmath4 values of 1 , 3 , and 5 gev/@xmath1 , to illustrate the dynamics leading to the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for the fluctuating ic we choose two very hot events ( red and orange dashed lines ) and two relatively cold events ( blue and green dotted lines ) whereas the smooth ic event is shown by the solid black lines in the figure .",
    "the @xmath57 results clearly demonstrate that most of the high @xmath4 photons are emitted quite early where the photon emission rate drops by two orders of magnitude within a time period of about 2 fm/@xmath1 for @xmath58 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the cold events reflect a relatively smaller system lifetime .",
    "the most interesting observation is that the cold events produce more photons at @xmath58 gev/@xmath1 compared to the smooth profile due to the presence of a few hotspots .",
    "in conclusion , we find a large enhancement in the production of thermal photons for event - by - event fluctuating ic compared to a smooth profile in the ideal hydrodynamic calculation . for @xmath59 gev/@xmath1 , the production is increased by 2040% for the fluctuating initial conditions , whereas for @xmath7 gev/@xmath1 , it increases by about a factor of 2 , which gives better agreement with phenix data in the region @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "a small value of the plasma formation time ( 0.17 fm/@xmath1 ) ensures that a fraction of the pre - equilibrium photons is accounted for which is an important source of direct photons at large values of transverse momentum and hard to estimate separately .",
    "the contributions from the initial hard processes and jet - matter interactions are significant for @xmath7 gev/@xmath1 , and should be added with the thermal radiation in order to explain the data in the entire @xmath4 range shown in fig .",
    "this enhancement is a result of the strong temperature dependence of the thermal photon emission rates which specifically probe the hotspots .",
    "we checked that the photon spectra for the swn profile are harder than the spectra for ewn profile , however the quantitative difference between the fluctuating and smooth ic remains similar for both the cases .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the wounded nucleons and binary collision profiles for both entropy and energy initializations combined with photon elliptic flow from the fluctuating ic would be very valuable .",
    "the difference between the smooth and fluctuating ic is expected to increase for peripheral collisions as well as for lower collision energies .",
    "we postpone these issues for a future study .",
