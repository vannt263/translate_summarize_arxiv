    "nonlinear sigma models ( nlsm ) are of great interest since they appear as effective models for many quantum systems in various branches of physics , ranging from solid state physics ( e.g. quantum hall effect ) to particle physics ( e.g. theory of light mesons ) @xcite .",
    "they are particularly useful in the description of theories whose symmetries are broken below a certain scale . from a perturbative point of view , nlsm are considered as fundamental theories only in two dimensions , while in higher dimensions they are mainly used as effective theories , since the coupling constant has negative mass dimension and the theories are not perturbatively renormalizable .",
    "however , there is the possibility that in @xmath2 dimensions these models are non - perturbatively renormalizable , i.e. `` asymptotically safe '' @xcite .",
    "the concept of asymptotic safety has mainly been applied in order to provide a non - perturbative renormalization of gravity @xcite .",
    "it is known that nlsm and gravity exhibit many structural similarities , since both are described by non - polynomial interactions and have the same power counting behavior .",
    "further , both have been shown to be non - perturbatively renormalizable in a large-@xmath1 expansion ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nlsm can therefore serve as interesting laboratory to test and develop techniques for the more involved theory of gravity .    a promising approach to explore the non - perturbative quantization of asymptotically safe theories",
    "is provided by the `` functional renormalization group '' ( frg ) @xcite .",
    "it describes the scale dependence of a quantum field theory and in particular of its effective action by means of an exact functional equation . in order to treat theories with nontrivial target spaces like the nlsm",
    ", some advanced background techniques have been developed within the frg framework , which still require a deeper understanding .",
    "nonlinear o(@xmath1 ) models provide a useful testing ground for these conceptual issues , because they attracted a lot of attention within statistical field theory and , as a result , their critical properties are well - known .    the frg approach is a suitable tool to investigate the phase structure of physical systems . a second order phase transition , for instance , is related to a fixed point of the renormalization group flow .",
    "while we will explicitly study the nonlinear o(@xmath1 ) model , it is expected that they possess the same critical properties as their linear counterparts .",
    "the hypothesis of universality states that two short - range theories with the same dimension and the same symmetries belong to the same universality class .",
    "this expectation is strongly supported by many explicit computations for @xmath2 , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "while monte carlo simulations yield the critical exponents within an o(@xmath1)-invariant formulation , there is further need of non - perturbative analytical studies that are manifestly covariant and can confirm the critical properties of the nonlinear models .    understanding the phase structure of field theories with curved target spaces and advancing the techniques developed to deal with such theories within the frg are the main motivations for the present work .",
    "we will study the nonlinear o(@xmath1)-models in a background field expansion @xcite and compute the effective action in a truncation that includes all terms of fourth order in the derivatives ( see also @xcite for some related computation ) .",
    "we will derive the flow in arbitrary dimensions and then focus on the interesting case @xmath2 .",
    "we will employ a manifestly covariant background field method and improve the formalism used in @xcite by taking care of the specific scaling of the fluctuation fields in a fully non - perturbative way .",
    "the three dimensional linear sigma model has been examined in the frg framework for a truncation that contains all operators up to the fourth order in the derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "the results in @xcite confirm the existence of a second order phase transition corresponding to a fixed point of the rg flow , and show that the fourth order truncation provides a significant improvement over the second order ( local potential ) approximation , in terms of precision with which the critical exponents and the anomalous dimension are computed , as compared to other methods . in our computations of the nonlinear model",
    ", the inclusion of fourth order operators also improves the sensitivity to the critical properties in comparison to the second order truncation studied in @xcite , such that the critical exponent of the correlation length at the nontrivial fixed point qualitatively agrees with the expectation for the o@xmath3 universality class .",
    "however , one particular operator of fourth order destabilizes the system and no fixed point can be found for the full fourth order truncation . whether this represents a physical property of the nonlinear model is a delicate question , since it would imply a departure of the critical behavior of the nonlinear model from that of the linear one .",
    "it is not yet possible to give a conclusive answer to this issue , but we will argue that the nontrivial fixed point may reappear , once higher order operators are taken into account .    another important motivation of this article is to provide explicit results for a direct comparison between the frg approach and the widely used ab - initio lattice approach to field theories .",
    "an accompanying analysis of the renormalization group flow of various nonlinear o(@xmath1 ) models on the lattice by means of the monte carlo renormalization group ( mcrg ) method will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to see how these two non - perturbative methods complement each other with respect to the fp structure and critical properties .",
    "this article is structured in the following way : section [ background field method ] is devoted to a covariant description of the o(@xmath1 ) models with curved target spaces and the development of the background field expansion . in section [ functional rg ]",
    "we will recall the frg approach and show how to implement the background field method .",
    "our truncation of the effective action is discussed in section [ higher derivative model and beta functions ] and the running of the remaining couplings is derived .",
    "section [ on phase transition ] presents an analysis of the renormalization flow and the critical properties of the model .",
    "the conclusions are contained in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "a field of the @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model is a map @xmath4 from spacetime @xmath5 to the unit - sphere in @xmath6 . in the present work we will choose for @xmath5 the euclidean space @xmath7 .",
    "it is convenient to regard the components @xmath8 as coordinates on the target space @xmath9 .",
    "the field space of all these maps is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the target space is the homogeneous space @xmath11 with @xmath0 as its isometry group .",
    "it is equipped with a unique riemannian metric @xmath12 that is @xmath0-invariant .",

    "the action is invariant under arbitrary reparametrizations @xmath16 of the fields , provided that the metric @xmath12 transforms as a symmetric @xmath17-tensor . in addition the model admits the @xmath0 isometries on the sphere as symmetries .",
    "these isometries are generated by vector fields @xmath18 which satisfy a generalized angular momentum algebra , @xmath19=-f_{ij\\ell } k_\\ell\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 are the structure constants of the lie algebra of the rotation group .",
    "the infinitesimal symmetries generated by the @xmath21 are nonlinear @xmath22    from the invariant metric @xmath12 on the sphere one obtains the unique levi - civita connection @xmath23 and the corresponding riemann tensor @xmath24 , ricci tensor @xmath25 and scalar curvature @xmath26 .",
    "the levi - civita connection on the sphere is used to construct @xmath0-covariant derivatives of the pull - backs of tensors on the sphere .",
    "for example , given a pull - back of a vector on the sphere , its covariant derivative is @xmath27 the pull - back covariant derivative @xmath28 will be used extensively throughout this work .",
    "note that @xmath29 transform as vectors , while the coordinates @xmath30 are scalars .",
    "we also define the square of the covariant derivative @xmath31 and its laplacian @xmath32 .    in order to construct expansions of invariant functionals like such that the nonlinear symmetries are maintained",
    ", we will employ a covariant background field expansion .",
    "we therefore promote the metric @xmath33 on the sphere to a metric @xmath33 on field space @xmath34 where trivial spacetime indices have been suppressed for brevity . in a similar manner , the levi - civita connection , the curvature tensors and the laplacian can be promoted to @xmath34 as well @xcite .",
    "it is emphasized that the expansion variable ought to possess well - defined transformation properties both in the background field @xmath8 and in the field @xmath35 .",
    "it would for instance be a particularly hard task to construct @xmath0 covariant functionals in terms of the difference @xmath36 of two points in field space , as it transforms neither like a scalar , nor like a vector under isometries .    for @xmath37 being in a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath38",
    ", there exists a unique geodesic in @xmath34 connecting @xmath38 and @xmath37 .",
    "we then construct the `` exponential map '' @xmath39 here @xmath40 is an implicitly defined vector that belongs to the tangent space of @xmath34 at @xmath38 . also , @xmath40 is a bi - tensor , in the sense that it has definite transformation properties under both @xmath8 and @xmath35 transformations and for this reason we shall write it often as @xmath41 .",

    ", the norm of @xmath40 equals the distance between @xmath38 and @xmath37 in @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the definite transformation properties make @xmath40 a candidate to parametrize any expansion of functionals like around a background @xmath38 .",
    "the correspondence is invertible , therefore in we introduced the notation @xmath42 to be used when @xmath35 is understood as a function of @xmath43 .",
    "one always has to keep in mind that the relation between @xmath43 and @xmath35 is nonlinear .",
    "this background field expansion can easily be applied to any functional @xmath44 $ ] , @xmath45= f[\\phi(\\varphi,\\xi ) ] = f[\\varphi,\\xi]\\,,\\ ] ] where by abuse of notation we indicated with the same symbol the functional when it is a function of the single field @xmath37 , or of the couple @xmath46 . even though it may not be evident from the way the r.h.s . of is written , a functional like @xmath44 $ ]",
    "will never be a genuine function of two fields , but rather a function of the single combination @xmath47 , and thus is called `` single - field '' functional .",
    "there may be , however , functionals of @xmath38 and @xmath40 independently , and those are called `` bi - field '' functionals . as an example , we define the `` cutoff - action '' @xmath48 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int d^dx ~ \\xi^a { \\cal r}^k_{ab}(\\varphi ) \\xi^b\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is some symmetric @xmath17-tensor operator constructed with @xmath8",
    ". the cutoff action will play an important role in the next section , where we will also specify its properties .",
    "the functional is still invariant under transformations of the background field @xmath8 as well as the field @xmath35 ; however , for general @xmath49 , there is no evident way to recast it as a functional of the single field @xmath35 @xcite .",

    "however , it is very likely that an extension of the truncation to the sixth order in derivatives and an inclusion of operators like e.g. @xmath225 will affect the running of @xmath213 and shift the position of the fixed point .",

    "it increases with @xmath1 such that it approaches a linear function with a slope of roughly @xmath243 for large @xmath1 .",
    "similarly as for the leading order truncation the flow diagram has qualitatively the same structure as the diagram obtained by the mcrg @xcite .",
    "the operator corresponding to @xmath169 is irrelevant in both approaches and its critical value @xmath244 is small in comparison to @xmath241 .",

    "for this purpose , the effects of higher - order terms in @xmath260 $ ] ought to be studied .",
    "let us finally include the remaining operator with four derivatives @xmath263 .",
    "although it is of the same order as the operators with couplings @xmath169 and @xmath213 , it changes the flow such that there is no nontrivial fixed point for the system with couplings @xmath264 .",

    "in fact , already in the cruder truncation @xmath265 there is no nontrivial fixed point and it seems as if the renormalization of the coupling @xmath170 is not well - balanced .    one may wonder why the operator corresponding to @xmath170 destabilizes the renormalization group flow . in the computation of the full effective action , the renormalization of an operator of a given order is always affected by operators of higher order .",

    "the beta functions of @xmath169 and @xmath170 are quadratic functions , see in the appendix , and the coefficients of the polynomials must be fine - tuned such that both beta functions vanish .",

    "thus we expect that the inclusion of higher order terms will slightly modify the flow in a way that one recovers the fixed point and the information about the phase transition of the @xmath0 model , that we already detected in the truncation @xmath246",
    ".    however , there could be more subtle explanations why the flow of the operator @xmath266 does not lead to a stable fixed point .",
    "we only want to mention two possibilities : there were arguments brought forward recently @xcite that the regularization procedure of the functional renormalization group given by the introduction of @xmath76 may naturally require a corresponding modification of the path integral measure , which in turn provides an additional term to the flow equation of the average effective action .",
    "while this term yields only a renormalization of the vacuum energy in theories with linearly realized symmetries , it can affect the renormalization of nontrivial operators in theories whose path integral measure is field - dependent .",
    "the second possibility is that , in order to find a stable fixed point for the full system , one has to enlarge the truncation as dictated by hidden symmetries involving the background and the fluctuation fields . to this day",
    "the background field method is the most effective way to deal with nontrivial field - space geometries in the framework of the frg . nevertheless , further studies maybe needed to understand better which truncations in terms of background and fluctuation fields ought to be chosen in order to maintain the full reparametrization invariance of the theory .",

    "it exhibits one relevant direction , which is already present in an one - parameter truncation , and it is such that the inclusion of further couplings ( @xmath169 and @xmath213 ) only adds irrelevant directions .",
    "the critical value of the coupling @xmath213 is identically zero in a fourth - order expansion .",
    "however , the one - parameter truncation is not sensitive to the @xmath1-dependence of the critical exponent @xmath232 , which requires higher - order operators .",
    "the results we obtain for @xmath232 in the truncation @xmath246 agree qualitatively with the pre - existing literature , but show some numerical difference that is likely due to the limited truncation ansatz .",
    "we tested the presence of this fixed point against various approximations and choices of the coarse - graining scheme , to find that it is a very stable result .",
    "the renormalization properties of the nonlinear @xmath0 model have also been studied by means of the monte carlo renormalization group and will be presented in detail elsewhere @xcite , where a discretized version of the action is considered as lattice action . the quantitative comparison of the results of frg and mcrg is a delicate topic that has to be addressed with care .",
    "in fact , one must bear in mind that our truncation ansatz is _ not _ a bare action @xcite .",
    "the nature of the `` mass '' regularization of frg , as opposed to that of the lattice which is mass - independent , is expected to produce a nontrivial relation between the renormalized couplings of the two methods @xcite .",
    "however , we do expect the phase diagrams of frg and mcrg to share the same qualitative properties ( namely the existence of a fixed point with one uv - attractive direction ) .",
    "the mcrg flows that are computed for the fourth - order expansion of the model are ( apart from the coupling @xmath170 ) in good qualitative agreement with the results presented here @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , a nontrivial fixed point appears in our calculations only if one coupling , @xmath277 , is neglected .",
    "we strongly believe that this is not a pathology of the computation , but rather it is due to the limited truncation considered and the quadratic structure of the computed beta functions .",
    "however , we also admit the possibility that the operator corresponding to the coupling @xmath277 may have a special role in the nature of this phase transition . therefore further investigations are required in order to obtain a deeper understanding .",
    "we would like to thank holger gies , jan pawlowski , martin reuter , bjrn wellegehausen and daniel krner for useful discussions and the latter two for the collaboration on an accompanying numerical project on the renormalization group flow of sigma models .",
    "rf and oz benefited from discussions with alessandro codello , maximilian demmel and roberto percacci .",
    "this work has been supported by the dfg research training group `` quantum and gravitational fields '' grk 1523 .",
    "the research of oz is supported by the dfg within the emmy - noether program ( grant sa/1975 1 - 1 ) .",
    "in this appendix we give the explicit form of the beta functions of the couplings @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "these have been omitted from the main text because of their size . together with they",
