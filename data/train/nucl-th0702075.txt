    "<S> we present a new direct simulation monte - carlo method for solving the relativistic boltzmann equation . </S>",
    "<S> we solve numerically the 2-dimensional boltzmann equation using this new algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we find that elliptic flow from this transport calculation smoothly converges towards the value from ideal hydrodynamics as the number of collisions per particle increases , as expected on general theoretical grounds , but in contrast with previous transport calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have been argued to create a `` perfect liquid '' , with an extremely low viscosity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the essential piece of evidence is the large magnitude of elliptic flow at rhic  @xcite , which is as large as predicted by ideal - fluid models ( which assume zero viscosity ) . </S>",
    "<S> elliptic flow is an azimuthal asymmetry in the momentum distribution of particles , projected onto the plane transverse to the beam direction ( @xmath0 axis ) : in a collision between two nuclei with non - zero impact parameter , more particles are emitted parallel to impact parameter ( @xmath1 axis ) than perpendicular to it ( @xmath2 axis ) . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry results from the almond shape of the overlap region between the colliding nuclei , which is transformed into a momentum asymmetry by pressure gradients  @xcite : microscopically , elliptic flow results from the interactions between the produced particles , and is therefore a key observable of the dense matter produced at rhic .    in the microscopic language of particle physics , </S>",
    "<S> ideal fluid and low viscosity translate into small mean free path of a particle between two collisions or , equivalently , large rescattering cross sections between the `` partons '' created in a collision . </S>",
    "<S> the description of the system in terms of partons is itself questionable at the early , dense stage of the collision , but it is nevertheless a helpful , intuitive picture . the natural question which arises then is : how large must the partonic cross section be in order to achieve ideal - fluid behavior , i.e. , local thermal equilibirum ? how many partonic collisions are needed ?    in this paper , we address this issue by solving numerically a relativistic boltzmann equation , and comparing the results with relativistic hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the boltzmann equation reduces to hydrodynamics when the mean free path is small ( see  @xcite for a rigorous proof in the relativistic case ) . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , however , it has been found  @xcite that hydrodynamics produces larger elliptic flow ( by 30 - 40% ) than the boltzmann equation . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we address this issue using a different method . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation for the discrepancy found in  @xcite is suggested at the end of this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> the primary limitation of the boltzmann equation is that it only applies to a dilute system , where the mean free path of a particle is much larger than the distance between particles , so that one need only consider two - body collisions , many - body collisions occurring at a much lower rate . </S>",
    "<S> there is no reason to believe that the rhic liquid is dilute : interactions are nonperturbative , so that both the mean free path and the distance between particles are of order @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the boltzmann equation can not be used to directly simulate a heavy - ion collision ; nevertheless , it has the potential of giving us a grasp on deviations to thermalization .    </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic formula for the collision rate between two beams of particle densities @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and arbitrary velocities @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be written as  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scattering cross section . </S>",
    "<S> there are several methods for implementing this collision rate in monte - carlo algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> the most widely used method @xcite is the zpc algorithm  @xcite : this algorithm treats particles as hard spheres , which collide when their distance in the center - of - mass frame is smaller than @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative method is the stochastic collision algorithm proposed by xu and greiner  @xcite .    here , </S>",
    "<S> we implement a new algorithm , where relativistic effects are incorporated in a physically transparent way . </S>",
    "<S> the second term under the square root in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ relativistic ] ) is the relativistic correction . </S>",
    "<S> it is simply understood , in the case of colliding hard spheres , as a geometrical effect resulting from the lorentz contraction of the spheres . </S>",
    "<S> we take this contraction into account , in the monte - carlo simulation , by replacing spheres with oblate spheroids , whose polar axis is the direction of motion . as with the other algorithms , lorentz covariance and locality </S>",
    "<S> are broken in the sense that collisions occur instantaneously at a finite distance . however , these violations are small if the system is dilute  @xcite , which is required by the boltzmann equation . </S>",
    "<S> the difference with the zpc algorithm is that the collision time is determined directly in the laboratory frame , not in the center - of - mass frame .    for sake of simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a two - dimensional gas of massless particles in the transverse plane @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus neglect an important feature of the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions , the fast longitudinal expansion . </S>",
    "<S> as will be shown below , this is not crucial for elliptic flow , which is essentially unaffected by the longitudinal expansion . </S>",
    "<S> initial conditions for the @xmath13 particles are generated randomly according to a gaussian distribution in coordinate space , and an isotropic , thermal distribution in momentum space : @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature @xmath17 is determined as a function of the local particle density per unit area , @xmath18 according to @xmath19 , the equation of state of a massless ideal gas in 2 dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> particles interact via @xmath20 elastic collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we assume for simplicity that the total elastic cross section @xmath21 is independent of the center - of - mass energy @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> ( in 2 dimensions , the cross section has the dimension of a length . ) </S>",
    "<S> this is implemented in a monte - carlo calculation by treating each particle as a rod ( due to lorentz contraction ) of length @xmath23 perpendicular to the velocity . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , for each pair of colliding particles , one can assume that particle 1 has length @xmath24 and particle 2 is pointlike ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : impact ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the impact parameter of the collision is @xmath25     and a pointlike particle @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the impact parameter @xmath27 , as defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ defimpact ] ) , is negative . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : impact ] ]    this quantity is lorentz invariant . </S>",
    "<S> our collision algorithm is deterministic : the scattering angle in the center - of - mass frame @xmath28 is determined as a function of @xmath27 , as in classical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here are obtained with an isotropic differential cross section , i.e. , @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this prescription ensures that particles move away from each other after the collision and do not collide again . </S>",
    "<S> we now define two dimensionless numbers relevant to this problem . </S>",
    "<S> the average particle density per unit surface @xmath18 is   @xmath30 the typical distance between two particles is @xmath31 , while the mean free path of a particle between two collisions is @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of these two lengths is the dilution parameter @xmath33 : @xmath34 as explained above , applicability of boltzmann theory requires @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , locality and covariance require that the interaction length be much smaller than the mean free path  @xcite . in two dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the interaction length is @xmath21 , and @xmath36 : locality and covariance are thus recovered in the limit @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> the second dimensionless number is the knudsen number @xmath38 , which characterizes the degree of equilibration by comparing @xmath39 with the system size @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter quantity can be measured by any average of @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> a natural choice for elliptic flow is  @xcite @xmath43 the knudsen number is then defined as @xmath44 hydrodynamics is the limit @xmath45 , while the limit @xmath46 corresponds to free - streaming particles . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath33 and @xmath38 can be tuned by varying the cross section @xmath21 and the number of particles @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the mean free path is a local quantity , which depends on space - time coordinates : in particular , it increases as the system expands . </S>",
    "<S> strictly speaking , @xmath33 and @xmath38 defined by eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ defd ] ) and ( [ defk ] ) are initial values . </S>",
    "<S> dimensional analysis suggests that they are the relevant control parameters for this problem .    </S>",
    "<S> solving the boltzmann equation in the hydrodynamic limit requires both @xmath37 and @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn requires a huge number of particles @xmath13 in the monte - carlo simulation : inverting the above equations , one obtains ( assuming @xmath47 for simplicity ) @xmath48 since the computing time scales grows with @xmath13 like @xmath49 , one can not implement arbitrarily small values of @xmath33 and @xmath38 . instead , we choose to study numerically the dependence of elliptic flow on @xmath33 and @xmath38 , and extrapolate to the hydro limit @xmath50 .     with the knudsen number , @xmath38 , for several values of the dilution parameter @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical error on each point is @xmath51 . for each value of @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> , monte - carlo results are fitted using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ simpleformula ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : v2vsk ] ]    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : v2vsk ] presents our results for the average elliptic flow @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the aspect ratio of the initial distribution is @xmath53 , and the monte - carlo simulation has been pushed to very large times ( @xmath54 ) , so that all collisions are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> quite naturally , @xmath55 decreases monotonically to 0 as @xmath38 increases towards the free - streaming limit @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> for a given value of @xmath33 , the variation with @xmath38 is very well described by the simple formula proposed in  @xcite : @xmath57 where the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 are fit to our monte - carlo results . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 is the limiting value of @xmath55 when @xmath60 , expected to coincide with @xmath55 from hydrodynamics in the limit @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the value of @xmath62 depends very little on @xmath33 : @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the hydrodynamic limit is more general than the boltzmann equation and applies even if the system is not dilute . unlike @xmath62 , </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath59 strongly depends on @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> we do not have a simple explanation for this dependence . </S>",
    "<S> however , only the limit @xmath37 has a well - defined physical interpretation , as it corresponds to the boltzmann equation . for larger values of @xmath33 , locality and causality are broken , and the physical interpretation of the results is less clear . for @xmath37 , </S>",
    "<S> our fit gives @xmath64 .    </S>",
    "<S> an independent hydro calculation with the same initial conditions was done using the same code as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . for sake of consistency  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the equation of state of the fluid is that of a two - dimensional ideal gas ( i.e. , the equation of state of a dilute gas , as modeled by the boltzmann equation ) , whose velocity of sound is @xmath65  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the average @xmath55 at @xmath54 is @xmath66  ( the error bar in the hydro calculation is due to the fact that the calculation is pushed to very large times ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is compatible with the value @xmath62 obtained from the boltzmann calculation : boltzmann transport theory and ideal hydrodynamics agree in the limit @xmath60 , as expected .    the knudsen number is closely related to the average number of collisions per particle @xmath67 . from the definition , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ defk ] ) , one expects that the number of collisions per particle is @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the proportionality constant can be computed exactly for a gaussian distribution in the limit @xmath46  @xcite , which yields the relation @xmath69 where the factor 2 means that each collision involves 2 particles , @xmath70 is the initial eccentricity , and @xmath71 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . </S>",
    "<S> we used this formula to check numerically that our algorithm produces the right number of collisions for large @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our numerical results show that the product @xmath72 is remarkably constant for all values of @xmath38 , so that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ncollpart ] ) holds within a few percent . using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ simpleformula ] ) , this shows that an average of @xmath73 ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath74 ) collisions per particle are required to achieve 50% ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> 80% ) of the hydrodynamic `` limit '' on @xmath55 .     from the transport model , from the corresponding 2-dimensional hydro calculation , and from usual 3-dimensional hydro with bjorken longitudinal expansion . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : v2vst ] ]    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : v2vst ] compares the time - dependence of elliptic flow in hydro and in the transport model . </S>",
    "<S> the subtle point is that the convergence of @xmath75 towards hydro as @xmath60 is not uniform : for a given value of @xmath38 , deviations from hydro are large at early times , and tend to decrease afterwards . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , it can be shown , following the same methods as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , that the early - time behavior is @xmath76 in the transport model , and @xmath77 in hydro . </S>",
    "<S> this is compensated by the late - time behavior : @xmath55 decreases slowly at large times in hydro ( not seen in the figure ) , while @xmath55 from the transport model stays constant after the last collision has occurred .    </S>",
    "<S> can our 2-dimensional results be used in the context of heavy - ion collisions ? </S>",
    "<S> the essential difference in 3 dimensions is the fast longitudinal expansion due to the strong lorentz contraction of the colliding nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> elliptic flow , however , is a purely transverse observable which is little affected by the longitudinal expansion : fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : v2vst ] displays a comparison between the average elliptic flow computed in 2-dimensional hydro and in 3-dimensional hydro with bjorken longitudinal expansion ( the initial time in this calculation is @xmath78 , corresponding to @xmath79  fm / c in a semicentral au - au collision )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both yield similar results for the magnitude and the time - dependence of @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> one can reasonably expect that deviations from hydro are similar in 2 dimensions and in 3 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the number of collisions per particle , @xmath67 , is not the right quantity for carrying out the comparison ( neither the transport opacity  @xcite ) : in 3 dimensions , @xmath67 is large at early times ( with a fixed partonic cross section , @xmath67 diverges like @xmath80 as the initial time @xmath81 goes to 0 ) , but these collisions do not produce much elliptic flow ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : v2vst ] ) . as argued in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the knudsen number should be evaluated at the time when elliptic flow develops @xmath82 , with @xmath83 in the quark - gluon plasma phase . </S>",
    "<S> the mean free path is @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 , hence @xmath87 @xmath88 is the total ( charged+neutral ) multiplicity . </S>",
    "<S> for a semi - central au - au collision at rhic , @xmath89  mb@xmath90 . with this definition of @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ simpleformula ] ) should hold approximately in 3 dimensions , with @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> table  [ tab : sigma ] gathers numerical estimates obtained using the same values of @xmath10 as in ref.@xcite . for @xmath92  mb , corresponding to a qcd cross - section of 47  mb , the transport result should be only @xmath93 below hydro .    </S>",
    "<S> .expected values of @xmath55 for semi - central au - au collisions at rhic . for each value of the cross section , </S>",
    "<S> we quote the value of the equivalent debye - screened , leading order qcd cross section @xcite.[tab : sigma ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for this value of the cross section , molnar and huovinen find that @xmath55 from the transport calculation is lower by 30% than @xmath55 from hydro @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the dependence of their results on @xmath10 is at variance with our results . using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ simpleformula ] ) and ( [ kexp ] ) , the deviations from ideal hydro should decrease as @xmath94 as @xmath10 increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is very general : dissipative effects are expected to be linear in the viscosity @xmath95 , which scales like @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy with hydro should be at least twice smaller with @xmath96  mb than with @xmath92  mb , which is clearly not the case in fig .  1 of ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite . in our opinion , this can not be attributed to dissipative effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the problem may be the dilution condition @xmath37 , which is not satisfied in previous transport calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the trick to reduce @xmath33 in the zpc cascade algorithm is the `` parton subdivision technique '' : one multiplies the number of particles @xmath13 by a large number @xmath97 , and one divides the partonic cross section @xmath10 by @xmath97 , so that the knudsen number @xmath38 is unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between particles in three dimensions is @xmath98 , which replaces @xmath31 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ defd ] ) . taking parton subdivision into account </S>",
    "<S> , one obtains @xmath99 . the average particle density in a semicentral au - au collision at time @xmath100 is @xmath101  @xmath102  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> with @xmath92  mb and @xmath103  @xcite , @xmath104 , which is not very small compared to unity . the situation is worse at early times due to the longitudinal expansion : @xmath105 at @xmath106  fm / c . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath107 , carrying out the calculation with @xmath108 leads to overestimate the deviation from hydro by at least a factor of 2 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : v2vsk ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reason why previous calculations were done with such large values of @xmath33 is that small values are hard to achieve numerically : in 3 dimensions , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ npart2d ] ) is replaced with @xmath109 , and the computing time grows like @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> this was our motivation for studying first the 2-dimensional case .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have implemented a new algorithm for solving the relativistic boltzmann equation . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the convergence of the relativistic boltzmann equation to relativistic hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> since this requires both a dilute system ( @xmath37 ) and a small mean free path ( @xmath45 ) , which is costly in terms of computer time , we have restricted our study to two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this preliminary study has only addressed the average value of the elliptic flow ; differential results as a function of @xmath111 , as well as results on @xmath112 , will be presented in a forthcoming publication . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the average elliptic flow computed in the transport algorithm converges smoothly towards the hydrodynamics value as the strength of final - state interactions increases . </S>",
    "<S> isotropic partonic cross sections of 3  mb and 20  mb should produce respectively @xmath113 and @xmath114 of the hydro value for @xmath55 . </S>"
