    "the original penrose process @xcite ( see fig . [ fig : penrose ] ) involved particle disintegration in a kerr black hole ergosphere .",
    "one of the resulting particles falls into the black hole on a negative orbit , while the other escapes to infinity with energy larger than the original energy of the infalling particle .",
    "the energy gain arises , of course , from the rotational energy of the kerr black hole that absorbs the negative energy particle .",
    "shortly after this process was proposed , it was shown @xcite that a significant fraction of the infalling particle s rest mass must be converted to energy in its rest frame , in order that the positive energy particle escapes to infinity .",
    "the energy gain from the black hole is not very significant in this case compared with the energy conversion in the particle s rest frame , making this process  somewhat uninteresting \" from an astrophysical or technological point of view .",
    "subsequently piran , shaham and katz @xcite have shown that a collisional penrose process ( see fig . [ fig : penrose ] ) could work . in a collision between two infalling particles that takes place within the ergosphere",
    ", the energy in the cm frame can be large ( in fact , it can be infinitely large under suitable conditions ) , and as such , it is possible that a penrose process could take place with positive energy gain for a particle that escapes to infinity .",
    "detailed analysis @xcite , however , has shown that even though the energy in the cm can grow infinitely large , when imposing the condition that one of the particles escapes to infinity , the energy gain would still be modest ( of order unity ) .",
    "recent interest in this idea arose when banados et al .",
    ", banados+09 rediscovered that a collision near a kerr black hole s horizon can have infinitely large energy in the cm frame .",
    "it was suggested that this infinite energy could be utilized to accelerate particles to extremely large energies . however , detailed studies @xcite refined some of the earlier analysis of penrose collisions .",
    "these studies have shown , once more , that the requirement that the particle produced in the collision escapes to infinity imposes stringent conditions on its trajectory , and limits its energy to , at most , a few times the energy of the infalling particles .",
    "this result is intuitive : when two infalling particles collide near the horizon , their cm has an enormous negative radial momentum .",
    "hence , most of the particles produced in such collisions will fall into the black hole , and only a small fraction will escape .",
    "these last estimates assumed , naturally , that the colliding particles ( that are deep within the ergosphere and , for high efficiency , infinitely close to the black hole s horizon ) are on in - going trajectories .",
    "this natural assumption was revised by schnittmann @xcite , who pointed out that a particle with sufficient angular momentum can infall from infinity and bounce to an outgoing orbit , even infinitely close to the horizon .",
    "now we can have a collision between two particles , originally infalling from infinity , one of which is outgoing ( see fig . [",
    "fig : penrose ] ) . clearly the radial momentum is larger in this case , and the probability of the resulting particle to escape is larger . correspondingly , a larger energy gain by a factor of a few ( compared to the case of two infalling particles ) is possible @xcite .",
    "more recently , berti et al .",
    "@xcite considered even more radical initial conditions .",
    "they also consider a collision between an outgoing and infalling particle- however , this outgoing particle , which we denote here with a subscript @xmath0 , is not one that has fallen from infinity and turned around the black hole",
    ". the angular momentum of this particle is smaller than the critical one needed for a particle to bounce .",
    "instead , this particle is emerging outwards from the black hole ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : penrose ] ) .",
    "a collision of such a particle with an infalling particle can result in an outgoing particle whose energy is unbounded . in the following , we will denote this particle by the subscript @xmath1(for `` outgoing '' ) , indicating that this particle is an escaping one .",
    "berti et al @xcite dub such collisions `` super - penrose , '' and suggest that ultra - high - energy debris can arise from them .    however , one should ask - can such an outgoing particle occur naturally ?",
    "berti et al .",
    ", @xcite address this question , and show that a collision between two particles , infalling from rest at infinity , can result in an @xmath0 type particle .",
    "this comes at a hefty price , however- one of the infalling particles must be extremely energetic .",
    "we show here that the energy needed to produce the essential intermediate particle @xmath0 is significantly larger than the energy of the escaping final particle @xmath1 .",
    "thus , from the point of view of an observer at infinity , the super - penrose collision results in a net ( extremely large ) energy loss- the black gains energy , rather than giving its energy away .",
    "for simplicity , we consider a maximal kerr black hole ( @xmath2 , for which the penrose process is most effective ) , and collisions that take place in the equatorial plane .",
    "we define @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 as the mass , energy and angular momentum of particle @xmath6 , as measured by an observer at rest at infinity .",
    "we denote the impact parameter of a particle as @xmath7 , and note that particles with @xmath8 ( and a positive @xmath5 ) are deflected and turn around the black hole , unable to reach @xmath9 . with @xmath10 a particle is deflected at @xmath9 ( but , because of the singular nature of the radial coordinate at the horizon for a=1 , this deflection point is still outside the horizon ) .",
    "we consider two successive collisions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : penrose3 ] ) .",
    "the first collision is between particle @xmath11 and particle @xmath12 that fall from infinity , collide , and produce an outgoing particle denoted @xmath0 as well as another particle ( marked @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : penrose3 ] ) that falls into the black hole .",
    "the second collision is the super - penrose process discussed in @xcite . in this collision",
    "an infalling particle , denoted @xmath14 , and the outgoing particle @xmath0 , that was produced in the first collision , collide and annihilate , producing two photons : one , denoted @xmath1 that escapes to infinity . and another one that falls into the black hole ( marked @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ fig : penrose3 ] ) .",
    "we begin by examining the second collision , the super - penrose one .",
    "particle @xmath0 is outgoing , and its impact parameter @xmath16 is less than the critical one . to normalize the calculations ,",
    "we choose @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the outgoing particle @xmath0 has an impact parameter @xmath19 .",
    "3 depicts the maximal efficiency of this collision , defined as : @xmath20 } { e_1+e_x } = \\\\ \\nonumber & & \\frac { ( 2 - { b_1})\\ , ( 2 - { b_x } ) } { 2 ( 4 - { b_1 } -   { b_x } ) + \\sqrt{3}\\ , ( { b_1 } - { b_x})}\\cdot \\frac{1}{(r - 1 ) } + o ( 1 ) , \\label{eq : eff1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 $ ] is the maximal possible energy of particle @xmath1 that escapes to infinity .",
    "this efficiency , @xmath22 , diverges like @xmath23 as the collision point approaches the horizon ( @xmath24 ) .    as mentioned earlier , the origin of particle @xmath0 is non - trivial .",
    "@xmath25 suggests a massive particle falling from rest at infinity , but an infalling particle with @xmath26 will fall into the black hole .",
    "berti et al .",
    "@xcite propose that such a particle can be produced in a near - horizon collision of two other massive particles , falling from rest at infinity .",
    "we denote these particles as @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the collisions results in two particles : @xmath0 , and a particle denoted @xmath13 ( which ultimately falls into the black hole ) .",
    "[ fig : eff1 ]    following @xcite , we choose @xmath11 and @xmath12 to radially fall from rest at infinity with no angular momentum : @xmath27 .",
    "but while @xmath28 , @xmath29 is unspecified .",
    "we calculate the minimal mass , @xmath30 , required to produce the outgoing sub - critical particle @xmath0 with @xmath31 , @xmath19 and @xmath32 ( together with an infalling particle @xmath13 ) .",
    "to do so , we solve , bearing in mind conservation of energy and angular momentum , the radial momentum equation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 where we have set here @xmath35 .",
    "we find that : @xmath36 where the equality is satisfied in the limiting case of @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding efficiency of this collision , @xmath38 , is : @xmath39    the crux of the problem is that for an observer at infinity , the energy loss involves the rest mass energies of particles infalling from infinity : @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath30 , while the energy gain is @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the real efficiency of the whole process is the product of two efficiencies - the efficiency of the first collision , @xmath43 , and the efficiency of the second collision , @xmath22 .",
    "all together we have : @xmath44 } { e_1+e_2+e _ * } = \\frac{{\\rm max}[e_o(r , b_1,b_x ) ] } { 2+m _ * }   \\\\",
    "\\nonumber   & & = \\frac{2- b_1}{4 [ 2 ( 4-   { b_x } - { b_1 } ) + \\sqrt{3}\\ , \\left({b_x } - { b_1}\\right ) ] } \\cdot ( r-1 ) + o ( r-1)^2 \\    .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this @xmath45 should replace @xmath22 , given by @xcite as the real efficiency of the process . while @xmath22 diverges as @xmath46",
    ", @xmath45 becomes diminishingly small , and vanishes as @xmath47 .",
    "to summarize we have shown that while the maximal energy of the escaping particle @xmath1 diverges , infinitely large energy has to be invested in order to produce it .",
    "the ratio of the energy output compared with the energy invested is vanishingly small .",
    "namely this process is extremely inefficient . the maximal efficiency in this combined process @xmath48 is less than unity",
    "this happens when @xmath49 and @xmath50 and the collision takes place on the boundary of the ergosphere .",
    "it should be stressed that this limit to the efficiency holds for the specific configuration discussed by @xcite in which @xmath51 and @xmath52 while @xmath30 and @xmath53 are arbitrary .",
    "one can generalize the process and consider arbitrary impact parameters , @xmath54 , @xmath53 and @xmath55 for all three particles ( keeping however @xmath51 ) . if @xmath56 one can also consider the possibility that this particle has turned around the black hole and it is outgoing at the point of the collision .",
    "this general case allows for larger efficiencies and one can see that the overall efficiency , @xmath45 in this case is slightly larger but comparable to the maximal efficiency obtained by @xcite . as expected , this indeed happens when both collisions are close to the horizon and one of the particles has turned around the black hole and is moving outwards .",
    "however , given that this  black box \" of three incoming particles and two internal collisions is much more complicated and requires much higher fine tuning than the single collisions considered by @xcite , this gain in efficiency is unlikely to be of any physical relevance .",
    "the basic difficulty in obtaining an efficient collisional penrose process is that for a realistic collision that takes place between two infalling particles , the overall momentum of the cm system points towards the black hole .",
    "the condition that a particle produced in such a collision escapes from the black hole is very limiting , and correspondingly the energy gain is not large .",
    "clearly , if one of the colliding particles is on an outgoing trajectory , the overall ingoing momentum of the system is reduced and a particle emerging from this collision can escape more easily . hence , higher energy gains are possible .",
    "the configuration is still limited if one allows that the outgoing particle is an infalling one that has turned around the black hole @xcite . in this case",
    ", the collision must be close to the deflection point of this particle , and hence its radial momentum must be small .",
    "a much higher energy gain is possible if one invokes an arbitrary outgoing particle near the black hole .",
    "however , such a particle can not emerge from the black hole .",
    "it was suggested @xcite to produce this outgoing particle by yet another collision .",
    "we have shown , here , that the production of such an outgoing particle is not a trivial issue .",
    "it involves enormous energy , and the final efficiency of the combined process ( the production of the outgoing particle and the subsequent penrose collision ) is diminishingly small in the case considered in @xcite . at best , under more general conditions",
    ", this combined process can lead only to a modest energy gain , which is comparable to the total energy deposited at infinity . even disregarding the fine tuning required",
    ", these considerations suggest that it is quite unlikely that this such collisions take place in realistic astrophysical configurations .",
