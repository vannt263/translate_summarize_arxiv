    "in recent years theories with varying speed of light ( vsl ) has been attracted considerable attention [ 1 - 10 ] due to its ability to solve the so - called cosmological puzzles - the horizon , flatness and lambda problems of big - bang cosmology .",
    "all previous attempts to overcome these difficulties invoke the basic inflationary form , where the observable universe experiences a period of ` superluminal ' expansion . here , one has to modify the matter content of the universe such that ordinary einstein gravity becomes repulsive and halts the exponential expansion .",
    "one can however resolve to theories with varying speed of light as the alternative method to solve the above mentioned cosmological puzzles .",
    "here , instead of changing the matter content of the universe , one has to change the speed of light in the early universe .",
    "the universe is assumed to be radiation dominated in the early stage and the matter content is assumed to be the same as in the standard big - bang ( sbb ) model .",
    "so the geometry and expansion factor of the universe go in accordance with the sbb model . here for a free falling observer associated with the cosmic expansion , the local speed of light will decelerate from a very large value to its current value .",
    "+ so far some works have been done with vsl by magueijo and co - workers [ 1 - 5 ] and others [ 6 - 10 ] specially in isotropic cosmological models ( which also include bd - theory ) .",
    "very recently , magueijo has investigated [ 11 ] , the possibility of black holes formation by studying spherically symmetric solutions with vsl . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate in details the anisotropic kantowski - sachs ( ks ) model with vsl theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii deals with the basic equations in bd - theory for ks model with varying speed of light .",
    "perturbative solution to the flatness problem will be discussed in section iii , while non - perturbative study of this problem will be discussed in section iv for radiation era only and the exact solution to the flatness problem is presented in section v. in section vi , we will study solutions to the quasi - flatness problem and examine its asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the lambda and quasi - lambda problems and their asymptotic behaviours will be investigated in section vii .",
    "the paper concludes with a short discussion in section viii . +",
    "for anisotropic ks model with metric ansatz    @xmath1    the bd field equations with varying speed of light are    @xmath2-\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\phi}}{\\phi } \\right)^{2}-\\frac{\\ddot{\\phi}}{\\phi}\\ ] ]    @xmath3    and the wave equation is    @xmath4    here the velocity of light @xmath5 is an arbitrary function of time , @xmath6 is the bd coupling parameter and the bd scalar field is @xmath7 . from the above field equations we have the `` non - conservation '' equation    @xmath8    now @xmath9 is the equation of state in the radiation era for which the general solution @xmath0 is ( from equation ( 3 ) )    @xmath10",
    "the above field equations in bd - theory have been formulated in jordan frame .",
    "to switch over to einstein frame we shall have to make the following transformations    @xmath11    @xmath12    and the above field equations become ( @xmath5 is treated as constant )    @xmath13    @xmath14    and    @xmath15    with the prime `` @xmath16 '' and `` . ''",
    "represent the differentiation with respect to @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "+ one can interpret these field equations as standard ks equations with constant @xmath19 and a scalar field @xmath20 is added to the normal matter .",
    "the scalar field behaves like a `` stiff '' perfect fluid with equation of state    @xmath21    if the velocity of light is constant , then in einstein frame total stress - energy tensor is conserved but there is an exchange of energy between the scalar field and normal matter according to the following equation    @xmath22= -\\frac{\\sigma'}{\\sqrt{6 + 4\\omega}}\\left(\\hat{\\rho}-\\frac{3\\hat{p}}{c^{2}}\\right)\\ ] ]    on the other hand , if the velocity of light varies then we have two separate `` non - conservation '' equations    @xmath23    and    @xmath24    thus standard ks model field equations with constant @xmath19 for vsl are also the field equations for bd theory in einstein frame but here one must add to normal matter the scalar field energy and pressure .",
    "therefore , the total energy density and pressure are given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "for a possible solution to the flatness problem in vsl theory , let us first study solutions when there are small deviations from flatness .",
    "the critical energy density @xmath27 in a bd universe is given by the equation    @xmath28    in einstein frame the critical energy density for normal matter is    @xmath29=\\frac{\\rho_{c}}{g^{2}\\phi^{2}}\\ ] ]    hence , if we define the total critical energy as    @xmath30    then from ( 15 ) we have    @xmath31\\ ] ]    let us define a relative flatness parameter as    @xmath32    whose evolution equation is given by    @xmath33    here @xmath34 , is the equation of state , with @xmath35 constant .",
    "since    @xmath36    in jordan frame , the deviation from flatness is given by    @xmath37    where @xmath38 measures natural deviations from flatness .",
    "now @xmath39 , the adaptation parameter satisfies the differential equation    @xmath40    if @xmath39 is assumed to be very small compare to unity i.e.,@xmath41 , then neglecting the square term in ( 21 ) , one can integrate the above to get    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the integration constant .",
    "hence we have    @xmath44    in bd theory @xmath45 , so to solve the flatness problem @xmath0 should decrease in the early universe and the first term on the right hand side must dominate over the second one .",
    "+ in particular , in radiation era ( @xmath46 ) the above equation ( 23 ) simplifies to    @xmath47    where we have used equation ( 5 ) to obtain @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath48 is small and @xmath49^{n/(3n-2)}$ ] then [ 12,3 ] it is still possible to solve the flatness problem for @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath51 at late times , so the second term is always very small compare to the first and hence may be neglected .",
    "when @xmath52 ( constant ) we have @xmath53 in ( 20 ) and the differential equation for @xmath39 , ( 21 ) can be written as    @xmath54    now , if we assume a power - law form in the scale factors of the velocity of light then the above equation becomes    @xmath55    in order to get an exact analytic solution to the above equation , we assume @xmath56 , so we can neglect @xmath57-term .",
    "we then have the solution    @xmath58    with @xmath59 as the integration constant .",
    "+ furthermore , without assuming any restriction on the parameter @xmath60 , if we assume the two arbitrary constants @xmath61 and @xmath35 to be equal then also we have an exact analytic solution for @xmath60 , @xmath62^{-(5\\gamma-2)/(3\\gamma-2)}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 is an integration constant . +    .",
    "this figure is also drawn for the radiation era and assuming as before the simple expanding form for the scale factors .",
    "the variation of @xmath60 for different choice of the arbitrary constant @xmath63 is shown in the figure . ]    .",
    "this figure is also drawn for the radiation era and assuming as before the simple expanding form for the scale factors .",
    "the variation of @xmath60 for different choice of the arbitrary constant @xmath63 is shown in the figure . ]",
    "to obtain the exact solutions to the flatness problem we assume the variation of light mathematically by the relation [ 3,12 ]    @xmath64^{n}\\ ] ]    however , in the einstein frame the above relation reduces to @xmath65^{1/(3n-2)}$ ] and equation ( 12 ) becomes    @xmath66    the equation of state @xmath67 simplifies the above equation further to    @xmath68    an exact integral can be obtained ( assuming @xmath69 ) as    @xmath70^{(5\\gamma-2)/(3\\gamma-2)}\\ ] ]    hence for the radiation dominated era , we have in jordan frame    @xmath71    where we have used @xmath72 .",
    "+ moreover , in the jordan frame we have equation ( 29 ) for the velocity of light and we can write    @xmath73 + \\frac{n}{2}\\frac{\\dot{\\phi}}{\\phi}\\ ] ]    thus , if @xmath0 is a decreasing function then @xmath74/(3n-2)|$ ] and we can therefore conclude that a varying speed of light in the early universe ( with weaker gravity ) helps to solve the flatness problem . + alternatively , for general equation of state @xmath75 , if we make the transformation    @xmath76    and assume the variation of the velocity of light as    @xmath77    then the equation of continuity ( 4 ) becomes    @xmath78    integrating this equation gives    @xmath79^{n+1}}{8\\pi(n+1)}\\ ] ]    ( provided @xmath80 ) which gives the evolution for general @xmath35 .",
    "in this section we shall investigate whether it is natural to have evolution which asymptotes to a state of expansion with a non - critical density .",
    "let us start with the continuity equation for constant @xmath0 and assume as before the equation of state    @xmath81    and the velocity of light to be    @xmath82^{n/(3n-2)}\\ ] ]    then the integral gives    @xmath83^{(5\\gamma-2)/(3\\gamma-2)}\\ ] ]    ( it is to be noted that in order to obtain the integral one has to assume @xmath69 ) . + now substituting this value of @xmath84 in equation ( 2 ) we have    @xmath85^{(5\\gamma-2)/(3\\gamma-2)}}{(ab^{2})^{\\gamma}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath86^{2\\gamma/(3\\gamma-2)}\\ ] ]    in particular , for radiation era the above equation simplifies to    @xmath87    if @xmath88 is the density parameter , then it can be defined as    @xmath89    we note that the ratio between the two terms on the right hand side is almost a constant for a quasi - flat open universe . however , for @xmath46 , we get    @xmath90    for expanding universe @xmath91 grows with time .",
    "so asymptotically the second term on the r.h.s will be negligible and we have    @xmath92    which leads to an open universe with finite @xmath88 value today .      for the radiation era ( @xmath46 ) , let us define    @xmath93    so from the field equation ( 2 ) we get ( using equation ( 5 ) )    @xmath94    now , from equation ( 38 ) the expression of @xmath84 takes the form    @xmath95    in addition the critical density @xmath27 is obtained from the differential equation    @xmath96    hence the expression for the density parameter is    @xmath97    or equivalently ,    @xmath98    thus , if @xmath99 then as @xmath100 so we have @xmath101 .",
    "but if @xmath102 then @xmath103 . so asymptotically , we have a quasi - flat open universe .      in this section ,",
    "we consider general asymptotic behaviour when @xmath102 i.e. , for quasi - flat open universe .",
    "the equation ( 44 ) can be approximated by    @xmath104    which has a first integral    @xmath105    thus , if we assume @xmath106 , then @xmath107 and    @xmath108    for the case of @xmath109 , we have @xmath110 and @xmath111 in the limit as @xmath112 , or equivalently ,    @xmath113    in addition , when @xmath114 , we get @xmath115 , as expected for flat radiation asymptote .",
    "in this section , we shall examine the effect of variation of speed of light when a cosmological term is introduced in the bd field equations .",
