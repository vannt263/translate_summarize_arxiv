    "lisa_.    the event rate of emris has been estimated by numerous authors @xcite but remains rather uncertain , in part because of the slow nature of the inspiral process , which occurs on many dynamical times .",
    "this makes the inspiraling star very susceptible to scattering by other stars , which can change the orbital parameters .",
    "the formalism for inspiral rates is similar to that for prompt consumption of stars @xcite , but there are some important differences because the process is much slower .",
    "the picture can be understood as follows : let @xmath13 be the relaxation time of a star with negative energy @xmath14 ( hereafter `` energy '' ; @xmath15 for bound stars ) and specific angular momentum @xmath16 ( hereafter `` angular momentum '' ) .",
    "the relaxation time is the time - scale for a change of energy of order @xmath14 , or a change in angular momentum of order @xmath17 , the circular angular momentum .",

    "the time - scale for a change of order @xmath16 is @xmath20 . in particular ,",
    "the time - scale for a change in @xmath16 by the order of the loss - cone , determined by the angular momentum of the last stable orbit @xmath21 , is @xmath22 .",
    "inspiral due to dissipation by gw emission happens on a time - scale @xmath23 , which for highly eccentric orbits has a very strong angular momentum dependence , @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath25 , the angular momentum will be modified even if the star has @xmath26 . as a result",
    "it is very likely that the star will be scattered into the loss - cone ( or away from it , to an orbit where energy dissipation is very weak ) .",
    "such crs will eventually be consumed by the mbh and add to its mass , but they will not be observable as gw emitters ( gw bursts in our own gc may form an exception [ rubbo , holley - bockelmann & finn @xcite ] ) .",
    "the approximate condition @xmath27 translates into a minimal energy or maximal semi - major axis @xmath28 a cr must have in order to spiral in and become a _ lisa_source ( `` successful inspiral '' ) ; hopman & alexander ( @xcite ; hereafter ha05 ) estimate that for a mbh of @xmath29 , @xmath30 : nearly all crs with @xmath31 are promptly captured or deflected without giving an observable signal , while nearly all stars with @xmath32 do spiral in successfully .",
    "the fact that the distribution of crs near mbhs is crucial to the observational outcome , implies that mass - segregation is likely to play a very important role for emris .",
    "mass - segregation is a manifestation of dynamical friction .",
    "it drives the heaviest objects to the center , so their concentration within @xmath33 increases , and drives the lightest stars to larger radii , so that they are relatively rare within @xmath33 .",

    "@xcite studied tidal capture by a @xmath35 black hole in a young stellar cluster with ms masses up to @xmath36 . in spite of the fact that massive stars are scarce , captured stars typically had masses @xmath37 .",

    "one species consists of main sequence stars , assumed here to be of solar mass .",
    "mss do not contribute to the gw inspiral rate since they are tidally disrupted before spiraling in , but they do contribute dynamically and they dominate both in number and in total mass at the radius of influence .",

    "( [ e : dgmdt ] ) until steady state is obtained , after time @xmath95 . in figure ( [ f : nr ] ) we show the resulting densities for the different species .",
    "the df of the shbs is much steeper than that of the other types ( @xmath96 ) , and at @xmath97 the number density of sbhs becomes comparable to that of the wds .",
    "ms stars dominate everywhere by number , although we did not take into account stellar collisions @xcite which could deplete the mss close to the mbh .",
    "sbhs also determine the functional behavior of @xmath98 , where @xmath99 .    throughout most of the cusp @xmath100 , but near @xmath79 the df flattens , as required for the integrals in equation ( [ e : qm ] ) to converge at high energies @xcite .",
    "large slopes at intermediate energies are allowed by these equations , and arise when a population of massive objects with a low number density exists , as is the case in our model . at low energies",
    "the massive objects sink effectively to the center by dynamical friction . at high energies the massive objects dominate the dynamics ,",
    "decouple from the lighter objects , and form an @xmath101 `` mini - cusp '' .",
    "this process is reminiscent of the spitzer instability in globular clusters , where sbhs decouple from the other stars @xcite .",
    "the probability for inspiral @xmath102 is shown in figure ( [ f : sa ] ) .",
    "since the sbhs are more massive they lose energy to gws at a higher rate than the other species and can spiral in from larger distances .    in figure ( [ f : tr ] ) we show the cumulative rates of successful inspiral ( eq . [ e : gam ] ) for all crs as a function of distance from the mbh .",
    "we summarize some results in table ( [ t : model ] ) , where we also give the enclosed number of stars @xmath103 within @xmath104 .",
    ".model parameters and gw rates [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "in our model , sbhs dominate the emri rate , in spite of their small number density at @xmath41 .",
    "the combination of a very steep cusp ( @xmath105 ) and a larger @xmath33 due to their larger mass leads to @xmath106 per galaxy .",
    "we also note that the amplitude of the gws is proportional to the stellar mass , so that the distance at which these objects can be observed is @xmath107 times larger than that for wds and nss .",
    "thus , sbhs will dominate the cosmic detection rate .",
    "it is instructive to compare the emri rates we obtain here to those obtained by ha05 , where mass - segregation was not explicitly included . for sbhs , @xmath108 is larger by a factor @xmath109 .",
    "part of the difference is that we assume here a larger total number of sbhs within the cusp ( by a factor @xmath110 ; we normalized the sbh number fraction at @xmath41 to be @xmath111 , while ha05 assumed that the _ enclosed _ fraction of shbs is @xmath112 ) .",
    "more importantly , the steeper cusp leads to a higher capture rate ( by a factor @xmath113 , ha05 , eq . [ 32 ] ; ha05 assumed @xmath114 ) .",
    "the bh cusp is much steeper than any of the cases studied by @xcite , and in particular it is steeper than the cusp of a single mass population , @xmath101 @xcite .    the rates @xmath115 and @xmath116 are also somewhat larger than those found by ha05 .",
    "here the difference originates mainly in the behavior of @xmath13 : for wds and nss , @xmath13 was assumed to be constant by ha05 , as appropriate for a single mass population with @xmath117 .",
    "however , the interaction between sbhs and the other crs leads to a decrease in @xmath13 towards the mbh ( fig .",
    "[ f : nr ] ) . using the analytical expressions by ha05",
    ", it can be shown that if @xmath118 , and @xmath98 , the successful inspiral rate is enhanced by @xmath119 ( for @xmath120 ) relative to the @xmath121 case , where @xmath122^{2/3}$ ] , see ha05 eq . ( 29 ) .      we neglected here the effect of resonant relaxation @xcite , which can increase the emri rate by up to an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "a multi - mass analysis of rr has yet to be performed .",
    "in addition to _ direct capture _ of crs , emri can occur following the formation of sbhs in accretion disks @xcite , binary disruptions @xcite and tidal capture followed by a super nova explosion of the captured star @xcite .",
    "these other mechanisms lead to low eccentricity signals , whereas direct capture leads to high eccentricities ( ha05 ) .",
    "our estimate of the number fraction of unbound sbhs is somewhat uncertain , in part because we neglected dynamical effects for unbound stars .",
    "we note that our estimate @xmath123 is consistent with calculations by @xcite , who found @xmath124 .",
    "our galactic center contains a mbh of mass comparable to the mbh mass considered here @xcite .",
    "observational effects of a cluster of sbhs near the galactic mbh include microlensing @xcite , x - ray emission @xcite , capture of massive stars by an exchange interaction @xcite and deviations from keplerian motion of luminous stars @xcite .",
    "such effects could in principle be used to constrain the predicted densities .",
    "because of the large range of energies , the natural way to integrate the fokker - planck equation is to divide the energy range into equal logarithmic intervals . for convenience",
    "we give here the equations in terms of the logarithmic distance variable @xmath125 .",
    "the fokker - planck equation without sink terms is then written as    @xmath126 + g_m(z)\\int_{z}^{z_d}dz'(e^{z'}-1)^{-3/2}{\\partial g_{m'}(z')\\over \\partial z'}\\nonumber\\\\ & & -   { m'\\over m}(e^{z}-1)^{-3/2}e^{-z}{\\partial g_m(z)\\over \\partial z}\\int_{-\\infty}^{z}dz'e^{z'}g_{m'}(z ' )   -   { m'\\over m}e^{-z}{\\partial g_m(z)\\over \\partial z}\\int_{z}^{z_d}dz'e^{z'}(e^{z'}-1)^{-3/2}g_{m'}(z').\\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]"
