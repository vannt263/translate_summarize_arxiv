    "the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) is the nearest large neighbour to the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "its relative proximity offers a unique opportunity to study the stellar populations of a nearby , large galaxy without being hindered by interstellar extinction .",
    "though the stars in m31 are considerably fainter than mw field stars , they can still be resolved for photometric and low resolution spectroscopic observations while entire globular clusters ( gcs ) can be targeted for integrated light ( il ) spectroscopy .",
    "such observations contribute to studies of the formation and evolution of m31 and its satellite system .",
    "deep surveys of m31 s outer regions , such as the isaac newton telescope ( int ) survey @xcite and the pan - andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas ; @xcite ) have demonstrated that there is a significant amount of coherent substructure in the outer halo ; these coherent streams indicate that m31 s halo is currently being assembled by accretion of dwarf satellites .",
    "@xcite present maps of the outer halo , demonstrating that there are a multitude of streams , plumes , and clouds of metal - poor stars , along with a significant metal - rich population that is mostly located in the giant stellar stream ( gss ) south of m31 . as much as 42% of the most metal - poor stars ( @xmath3 < -1.7 $ ] ) lie in coherent substructure  for metal - rich stars ( @xmath3 > -0.6 $ ] ) this percentage rises to 86% .",
    "the rest of the outer halo stars are distributed in a `` smooth '' component .",
    "the presence of metal - rich and metal - poor coherent streams implies that m31 is currently accreting multiple dwarf satellites ( see , e.g. , @xcite for accretion simulations that lead to coherent streams ) .",
    "the locations and metallicities of the outer halo field stars can be used to infer the nature of these dwarf galaxies .    1 .",
    "the metal - rich gss and the surrounding metal - rich features indicate that m31 has accreted at least one fairly massive ( @xmath5  lmc - mass ) galaxy @xcite .",
    "star formation histories indicate that most of the metal rich stars formed more than 5 gyr ago , hinting that the progenitor may have been an early - type dwarf @xcite .",
    "2 .   intermediate [ fe / h ] stars are also found in coherent substructures , notably the sw cloud @xcite , which has its own gcs ( pa7 , pa8 , and pa14 ; @xcite ) and possibly its own h@xmath6roman1 gas @xcite .",
    "estimates based on metallicity and total brightness suggest that the sw cloud progenitor was also a fairly massive dwarf galaxy ( with a mass comparable to the fornax dwarf spheroidal ; @xcite ) .",
    "3 .   the most metal - poor streams are gas - free ( based on 21 cm observations ; @xcite ) and likely originated in lower mass dwarf spheroidal systems .",
    "the outer halo gcs also suggest that m31 has had a fairly active accretion history . of the @xmath7 gcs discovered in pandas ,",
    "many appear to lie along stellar streams .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the positions of these gcs are correlated with the positions of the streams , with a @xmath8% chance that these gcs are located along the streams by chance . pa7 and pa8 are kinematically associated with each other @xcite and with the sw cloud itself @xcite . @xcite also show that many of the gcs which appear to lie along streams could be associated , based on their kinematics .",
    "@xcite have also demonstrated that at least one outer halo gc ( g002 ) has likely been accreted from a dwarf satellite .    taken as a whole , the entire outer halo gc system is also different from the mw s gc population .",
    "for instance , @xcite show that m31 has more luminous and faint gcs than the mw ",
    "they suggest that m31 could have acquired these extra gcs through accretion .",
    "@xcite also demonstrate that the entire gc system has clear signs of rotation in both the gcs spatially associated with streams and those that are unassociated with streams .",
    "this rotation suggests either 1 ) that m31 experienced a merger with a galaxy large enough to bring in a substantial fraction of the outer halo gcs , or 2 ) that the parent dwarf galaxies were accreted from a preferred direction such that their angular momenta were correlated , as is presently seen for a separate plane of dwarf satellites @xcite .",
    "ultimately , the observations of outer halo stars and gcs indicate that m31 has recently experienced a merger with at least one massive dwarf and multiple lower mass dwarfs .",
    "detailed chemical abundances ( from high resolution spectroscopy ) are an effective way to isolate and identify coeval groups , a process known as `` chemical tagging '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with abundances of @xmath1 , iron - peak , and",
    "neutron capture elements , metal rich ( @xmath3 \\ga -1.5 $ ] ) stars and gcs from dwarf galaxies can be distinguished from those in massive galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) . unlike gcs associated with the mw and its dwarf satellites ,",
    "however , distant extragalactic targets must be observed through their integrated light ( il ) .",
    "while metallicity and @xmath1-abundances can be determined from lower resolution il spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) , the detailed chemical abundances necessary for chemical tagging analyses require high resolution il spectroscopy ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . as in the mw ( @xcite ) , if the m31 outer halo gcs originated in lower mass dwarf galaxies then they could have distinct abundance patterns from mw field stars , depending on metallicity .",
    "high resolution il spectroscopy has been tested extensively on galactic gcs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , demonstrating that    1 .",
    "il abundances trace the individual stellar abundances and represent cluster averages when abundances do not vary between stars 2 .",
    "abundance determinations from high resolution il spectroscopy are more precise than from lower resolution studies 3 .",
    "certain abundance ratios are very stable to uncertainties in the underlying stellar populations ( e.g. interloping field stars , uncertainties in cluster age , microturbulence relations , etc . ) , such as [ ca / fe ] 4 .",
    "partially resolved photometry down to the horizontal branch ( hb ) reduces systematic uncertainties by constraining [ fe / h ] and hb morphology .",
    "thus , a high resolution il spectroscopic analysis of m31 gcs can provide precise and accurate abundances that will be suitable for chemical tagging .",
    "high resolution il spectroscopic techniques have been applied to nearby gcs in the local group ( in m31 , @xcite ; the lmc , @xcite and @xcite ; and in dwarf galaxies , @xcite ) and in the large elliptical galaxy ngc  5128 @xcite . at the distance of m31 ,",
    "the size and brightness of its gcs make them ideal targets for high resolution il spectroscopy .",
    "this paper presents a high resolution il chemical tagging analysis of seven outer halo m31 gcs , five of which were first observed in pandas .",
    "this is the first chemical analysis for these five pandas clusters , at any resolution .",
    "section [ sec : data ] presents the data and the analysis methods , while section [ sec : modelatms ] describes the process for generating synthetic stellar populations for each cluster .",
    "the il abundances are given in section [ sec : abunds ] , and the implications for the formation of m31 s outer halo are then discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the primary goal of this high resolution spectroscopic investigation of m31 gcs is to study the nature of the stars and clusters in m31 s outer halo .",
    "the targets were therefore restricted to gcs with projected distances from the centre of m31 that are @xmath9 kpc ; priority was given to the gcs with the largest projected radii .",
    "observational constraints required that the targets were sufficiently bright to observe in a reasonable amount of time and to avoid stochastic sampling issues  as a result , the target gcs are on the bright end of the m31 outer halo gc distribution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "seven outer halo gcs were targeted ; their properties are summarized in table [ table : pandastargets ] .",
    "two of these target clusters ( h10 and h23 ) were discovered by @xcite ; the other five were discovered in the pandas programme @xcite .",

    "however , stars in sgr have low [ mg / ca ] ratios ( except possibly for stars in the sgr streams ; @xcite ) ; @xcite attribute these low ratios to a top - light imf , where the lack of massive stars means that less mg is produced than ca .",

    "note that most of the pandas gcs have higher [ mg / ca ] ratios than the m31 gcs  again , this is likely because the gcs in the @xcite sample are more massive than the pandas gcs , and therefore may have stronger star - to - star mg variations .",

    "pa17 is higher than the galactic field stars and clusters by @xmath42 , in agreement with the lmc and fornax field stars .",
    "this high [ mg / ca ] is driven by the high [ mg / fe ] ( determined from spectrum syntheses of the 5711  line ) and the low [ ca / fe ] ( from ews of four clean lines ) .",
    "again , the high mg suggests that pa17 is enriched with the products of the most massive stars , which may be due to imf effects , stochastic sampling of supernova ejecta , or rotating supernova progenitors ( @xcite also note that rotating massive stars will not produce as much ca , compared to non - rotating stars ) . despite its agreement with the lmc field stars , pa17 is distinct from the lmc gcs , because the [ mg / ca ] ratios of the metal rich lmc gcs are not high like the lmc field stars .",

    "the gcs therefore behave in a very different way from the field stars . again , this is likely to be a result of multiple populations , combined with the metallicity dependency of the mg / al anticorrelation ( e.g. @xcite ) . for these lower mass gcs , at low metallicities the star - to - star mg variations are likely to be strong in these ( fairly bright ) gcs , driving the integrated [ mg / fe ] down and [ na / mg ] up . with increasing [ fe / h ] ,",
    "the integrated [ mg / fe ] returns to its `` primordial '' value , and the [ na / mg ] ratio stabilizes .",

    "these points are shown in figure [ fig : allrgbs ] , while the slopes are listed in table [ table : rgbslopes ] .",
    "uncertainties in rgb slope were estimated based on the uncertainties in colour at the two magnitudes .",
    "the metal - poor clusters have small uncertainties in rgb colour , though this translates into large uncertainties in slope because the rgbs are steeper .",
    "the metal - rich clusters have very uncertain rgb colours , but because the rgbs are flatter the uncertainty in slope is much lower . note that at higher [ fe / h ] ( @xmath65 ) a linear fit to the rgb is no longer a good approximation to the actual shape of the rgb  thus , this calibration is likely to break down at the metal rich end .    for each cluster the [ fe / h ] ratios from @xcite",
    "were adopted ; [ fe / h ] uncertainties of 0.05 dex were assumed .",
    "figure [ fig : mwrgbslopes ] shows the relationship between rgb slope and cluster [ fe / h ] .",
    "the linear least squares fit to the points is shown with the solid line , while the dashed lines show the uncertainty in the fit .",
    "the trend is clear : metal - poor gcs have steeper rgbs than more metal - rich gcs .",
    "non - standard chemical abundance mixtures ( in , e.g. , c , n , o or @xmath1-elements like mg or si ) can affect the shape of the rgb ( e.g. @xcite ) , which would affect where a cluster falls in the plot .",
    "the adopted [ @xmath1/fe ] ratio is particularly important : the qualitative effects of [ @xmath1/fe ] on the f606w , f814w rgb slope are illustrated in figure [ fig : alphaisos ] using the victoria - regina isochrones from @xcite and the colour transformations of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : alphaisosa ] shows that at a given [ fe / h ] , clusters with @xmath66 = 0 $ ] have steeper rgbs than clusters with @xmath66 = + 0.4 $ ] ; this offset is greater at higher metallicity .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig : alphaisosb ] illustrates that the slope difference can be mimicked by lowering [ fe / h ] by 0.3 dex while maintaining @xmath66 = + 0.4 $ ] ( note that in figure [ fig : alphaisosb ] the dotted isochrones have been shifted by 0.02 magnitudes so that both the @xmath1-enhanced and @xmath1-normal isochrones can be seen ) .",
    "the blue dot - dashed line in figure [ fig : mwrgbslopes ] shows the effects of lowering [ @xmath1/fe ] by 0.4 dex , which is approximated by lowering the [ fe / h ] by 0.3 dex ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "the rgbs of the pandas clusters are shown in figure [ fig : pandasrgbs ] , while the rgb slopes and spectroscopic metallicities are shown in figure [ fig : rgbslopes ] .",
    "the photometric uncertainties , sparseness of the cmds , and difficulties in determining distance moduli ( particularly for pa56 ) make the rgb slopes more uncertain for the pandas clusters , compared to the galactic gcs .",
    "however , all pandas gcs agree with the mw rgb slope relation in figure [ fig : mwrgbslopes ] within their errors .",
    "this relationship illustrates that the spectroscopic metallicities are consistent with the observed rgb slopes in the _ hst _ cmds .",
    "all of the clusters in figure [ fig : rgbslopes ] lie above the mw relation closer to the low [ @xmath1/fe ] value , hinting at the possibility of low [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios in the pandas targets .",
