    "then the following question is actual : _ what is the number of independent conditions of isometric deformation _ ?",
    "let us finally describe a relation between ( finite and infinitesimal ) flexibility of @xmath6-ribbon surfaces and flexibility of all 3-ribbon subsurfaces contained in them .",
    "we start with theorem on infinitesimal flexibility .",

    "the degree of freedom for a flexion of a generic 2-ribbon developable surface is 1 , as can easily be seen from the genericity condition for 2-ribbon surfaces .",
