    "many systems can be efficiently modeled using a network structure where the system entities are the network nodes and the relations between the entities are the network links @xcite .",
    "however , many systems are also characterized by small sub groups in which the entities belonging to a group strongly depend on each other .",
    "we coin the relation between each two nodes in such a group as dependency links @xcite . for example consider a financial network : each company has trading and sales connections with other companies ( connectivity links ) .",
    "these connections enable the companies to interact with others and function together as a global financial market .",
    "in addition companies that belong to the same owner strongly depend on one another ( dependency links ) .",
    "if one company fails the owner might not be able to finance the other companies that will fail too .",
    "another example is an online social network ( facebook or twitter ) : each individual communicates with his friends ( connectivity links ) , thus forming a social network through which information and rumors can spread .",
    "however , many individuals will only participate in a social network if other individuals with common interests also participate in that social network , thereby forming dependency groups .",
    "previous studies focused on network models containing only a single type of links , either connectivity links @xcite or dependency links @xcite . a network model containing both connectivity and dependency links",
    "was first introduced for two interdependent networks @xcite .",

    "the initial failure of nodes may trigger an iterative process of cascading failures that has a devastating effect on the network stability .",

    "links the network disintegrates in a form of a first order phase transition while for a low density of dependency links the network disintegrates in a second order transition .",
    "however the combined model presented in @xcite was based on an unrealistic assumption that all dependency groups are of size 2 , i.e. only pair of nodes depend on each other . in reality , as the examples above suggest , groups of several elements may depend on each other .    in this paper",

    "when nodes fail in a network containing both connectivity links and dependency clusters , two different processes occur .",
    "( i ) connectivity links connected to these nodes fail , causing other nodes to disconnect from the network ( percolation step ) .",
    "( ii ) a failing node cause the failure of all the other nodes of its dependency cluster , even though they are still connected via connectivity links ( dependency step ) .",
    "thus , a node that fails in the percolation step leads to the failure of its entire dependency cluster , which in turn leads to a new percolation step , which further leads to a dependency step and so on .",
    "once the cascade process is triggered it will only stop if nodes that fail in one step do not cause additional failure in the next step .",
    "we start by presenting the formalism describing the iterative process of cascading failures . on each step",
    "we apply the two processes - a percolation process followed by the removal of relevant dependency groups . before each percolation stage",
    "the accumulated cascades are described as equivalent to a single random removal , @xmath20 .",

    "similarly , applying the dependency process at stage @xmath22 on a network of size @xmath26 results in a remaining functional nodes consisting of a fraction @xmath27 which is a fraction @xmath28 from the original network .",
    "the iterative process is initiated by the removal of a fraction @xmath6 of the network nodes .",
    "the remaining part of the network is @xmath29 .",
    "this initial removal will cause additional nodes to disconnect from the giant cluster due to the percolation process .",
    "the fraction of nodes that remain functional after the percolation process is @xmath30 . before the dependency step we describe the accumulated cascades of the previous steps .",
    "the fractions of nodes that fail due to the initial removal and due to first percolation step are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , and the accumulated cascades are equivalent to a single random removal of @xmath33 .",
    "thus , we denote the remaining functional part before the dependency step as @xmath34 .",
    "each node from the non functional part will cause all the other nodes of its dependency cluster to also fail ( dependency process ) .",
    "the remaining functional part of the network after the dependency step is @xmath35 .    let us now calculate the accumulated failure up to this step .",
    "the sum of the previous steps , the initial removal of ( 1-p ) , the removal due to the percolation step , @xmath36 and the removal due to the dependency step @xmath37 , is equivalent to a single random removal of @xmath38 from the original network ( @xcite ) . after such removal the remaining part of the network before the second percolation step is @xmath39 , and the size of giant cluster is then @xmath40 .    following this approach",
    "we can construct the sequences @xmath23 and @xmath26 of the remaining fraction of nodes and the sequences @xmath41 and @xmath42 of functional nodes , at each stage of the cascade of failures .",

    "next , we calculate explicitly @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in the general case , each node belongs to a dependency group of size @xmath3 with a probability @xmath59 so that the number of groups of size @xmath3 is equal to @xmath60 . since after random removal of @xmath61 of the nodes each group of size @xmath3 remains functional with a probability @xmath62",
