    "values of superconducting critical temperatures t@xmath8 are comparable for both families of pnictides and chalcogenides and are about 30 - 50k [ ] .",
    "further interest to these chalcogenides was stimulated by experimental observation of rather nontrivial antiferromagnetic ordering with very high neel temperature of about 550k and fe vacancies ordering in the same range of temperatures in k@xmath10fe@xmath11se@xmath3 ( the so called 245 phase ) [ ] . despite intensive experimental work",
    "there is still no consensus on the composition of the phase , responsible for high-@xmath12 superconductivity in these systems .",
    "the most common point of view is that kfe@xmath3se@xmath3 ( 122 phase ) is the parent compound for superconductivity , while 245 phase is insulating [ ] . some other phases in this system were also reported [ ] .",
    "below we shall concentrate on electronic structure calculations for the parent 122 phase with different levels of hole doping .",
    "crystallographically pnictides afe@xmath3as@xmath3 , and chalcogenides fe(se , te ) , afe@xmath3se@xmath3 are quite similar with main structural motiff  layers of fe(as , se)@xmath13 tetrahedra . recently reported theoretical electronic band structures of fe(se , te ) [ ] and afe@xmath3as@xmath3 [ ] are found to be nearly identical to each other especially for those bands crossing fermi level .",
    "afe@xmath3as@xmath3 and afe@xmath3se@xmath3 compounds are simply isostructural .",
    "however lda ( local density approximation ) electronic structure of afe@xmath3se@xmath3 differs quite remarkably from that of afe@xmath3as@xmath3 as was directly shown in refs .",

    "lda+dmft hybrid computational scheme [ ] was employed .",
    "the main conclusion was that correlations lead to simple narrowing ( compression ) of lda bandwidth by the factor of the order of 2 or 3 .",
    "this observation agrees rather well with variety of angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data on afe@xmath3as@xmath3 compounds .",
    "fermi surface maps obtained from arpes experiments for afe@xmath3as@xmath3 are quite similar to those obtained from simple lda calculations : there are 2 or 3 hole cylinders around @xmath14-pointin the brillouin zone and 2 electron fermi surface sheets around ( @xmath15 ) point .    up to",
    "now there are only few lda+dmft papers devoted to fe chalcogenides [ ] .",
    "recently we performed the investigation of electronic structure of hole doped iron chalcogenide k@xmath4fe@xmath5se@xmath3 in the normal phase [ ] , inspired by available arpes data , for this system [ ] , especially those obtained in ref .",

    "the results of our calculations agree rather well with the general picture of arpes , obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] , with lda@xmath0+dmft showing slightly better agreement .",
    "we showed that this iron chalcogenide is actually more strongly correlated in the sense of bandwidth renormalization ( energy scale compression by the factor of about 5 in the energy interval @xmath61.5  ev ) around the fermi level ) , than the typical iron pnictides ( with compression factor of about 2 or 3 [ ] ) , though the coulomb interaction strength is almost the same in both families .",
    "moreover the k@xmath4fe@xmath5se@xmath3 system demonstrates absence of well defined quasiparticle bands on the fermi level in contract to pnictides .",
    "in this paper we continue our lda@xmath0+dmft study of system .",
    "we investigate the evolution of correlation effects upon hole doping , performing lda@xmath0 calculations at four doping levels : hypothetical stoichiometric composition with 29 valence electrons per unit cell through intermediate values of valence electrons 28 and 27.2 downto experimentally obtained composition k@xmath4fe@xmath5se@xmath3 with 26.52 electrons per unit cell .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the actual doping dependence of correlation effects on the electronic structure in iron chalcogenides is apparently more complicated than in iron pnictides and does not reduce to the simple picture of universal bandwidth renormalization ( compression ) .",

    "one can actually see , that upon hole doping correlation effects become stronger .",
    "this fact manifests itself in a different way for orbitals of various symmetry .",

    "this narrowing is most evident at @xmath61 ev and @xmath60.5 correspondingly .",
    "for @xmath41 ( second panel from top ) and @xmath42 ( bottom panel ) increase of narrowing with doping is mostly concentrated within the energy interval @xmath60.4 ev .    to get more insight into the lda@xmath0+dmft self - energy effects on bare lda@xmath0 bands we have determined energy scale renormalizations and energy shifts for variety of separate dispersions of bare lda@xmath0 band structure depicted in fig .  4 , which rather accurately fit bare bands to those plotted in the fig .  2 . also in fig .",
    "4 we show the standard lda bands ( dashed lines ) , just to emphasize that lda@xmath16 dispersions are quite close to lda ones ( see also refs .  [ ] ) . the obtained energy scale renormalization ( bandwidth compression ) factors and energy shifts ( shown in brackets ) are collected in the table  1 for all hole doping levels .",
    "these results show more complicated picture of bare lda@xmath16 dispersion transformations , than those obtained in ref .  [ ] , where we have proposed that all fe-3d band dispersions for the k@xmath4fe@xmath5se@xmath3 should be just compressed by a factor of 5 to get reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "in contrast to our previous work ref .",
    "[ ] here we fit lda@xmath0 bare bands exactly to maxima positions of the spectral function ( see stars on fig .  2 ) .",
    "thus we get more detailed picture which in general agrees with our early conclusions of ref .",
    "here we actually see , that different parts of bands in the first brillouin zone acquire different ( bandwidth or mass ) renormalization factors , which change with doping . for example the @xmath45 band ( see fig .",
    "4 ) almost does not have doping dependence at all ( see table  1 ) .",
    "renormalization for the part of @xmath41 band ( 2 ) only slightly depend on doping .",
    "however , the @xmath41 band ( 1 ) becomes monotonically more correlated ( renormalization factor grows up to 4.2 ) while hole doping increase .",
    "correlation renormalization of the @xmath42 orbital demonstrates nonmonotonic behaviour and is more pronounced for intermediate dopings .",
    "the renormalization factor of the @xmath43 band near the @xmath14 point abruptly increase up to 4.7 at n@xmath17=26.52 . here",
    "one should note that all four doping levels were treated with the same coulomb interaction parameters . despite this fact upon doping several orbitals of k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 become more correlated ( narrowed ) .",
    "this phenomenon is apparently related to the change of the correlated orbitals occupancy .",
    "the data collected in the table  1 might be helpful for interpretation of aprpes spectra in simple terms of renormalized bare lda band dispersions .",
    "in this paper we have performed detailed lda@xmath0+dmft study of correlation effects in k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 system at four hole doping levels : from hypothetical stoichiometric composition with 29 valence electrons per unit cell through intermediate values of valence electrons 28 and 27.2 towards composition k@xmath4fe@xmath5se@xmath3 with 26.52 electrons per unit cell , for which there are available arpes data on electronic dispersions [ ] .    within dmft correlation effects",
    "are concentrated in the self - energy which provides two types of modifications of the bare spectra at each energy : broadening ( lifetime effects ) by imaginary part of self - energy and energy shift due to its real part .",
    "we have shown , that in rather wide energy window @xmath62 ev ( in terms of lda energy scale ) for all dopings the lifetime effects are relatively weak and renormalization ( compression ) of quasiparticle bandwidths remains nearly the same and of the order of @xmath71.3 .",
    "however near the fermi level self - energy effects become more pronounced and complicated . in particular , the renormalization ( bandwidth compression ) factor grows from 1.3 for stoichiometric composition upto nearly 5 for k@xmath4fe@xmath5se@xmath3 ( for @xmath41 and @xmath43 bands ) .",
    "though all calculations were done with the same value of coulomb ( hubbard ) interaction , this increase of renormalization upon doping tells us that correlations also increase with doping . also following recent tendency of experimental arpes papers",
    "where energy shifts and and renormalization factors are determined separately for different bare lda bands [ ] to fit arpes data , we have provided quasiparticle mass renormalizations and energy shifts , which rather accurately transform bare fe-3d lda@xmath0 bands of various symmetries into lda@xmath0+dmft quasiparticle bands in different regions of the first brillouin zone . in fact , the detailed picture of band renormalizations close to the fermi level in k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 is pretty complicated .",
    "for example , the @xmath45 bands near the @xmath14-point and the @xmath41(2 ) bands in the middle of @xmath14-x and p - n directions almost do not feel doping changes . on the opposite , the @xmath41(1 )",
    "bands in all directions and the @xmath43 band near the @xmath14-point become monotonically more correlated ( renormalized ) with doping increase .",
    "finally , correlation renormalization of the @xmath42 band demonstrates non monotonic behaviour with doping , becoming more correlated for intermediate dopings .",
    "however , the general conclusion of ref .",
    "[ ] remains valid k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 systems demonstrates more pronounced correlation effects in contrast to 122 iron pnictides .",
    "this is clearly reflected in the absence of well defined quasiparticle bands in the vicinity of the fermi level , which demonstrates a kind of `` pseudogap '' behavior ( `` dark '' region around the fermi level in fig .",
