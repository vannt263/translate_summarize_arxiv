    "a central issue in studies of the chemical evolution of the galactic disc is to resolve the so called `` g - dwarf problem '' ( van den bergh , 1962 ; schmidt , 1963 ; pagel and patchett , 1975 ) .",
    "the problem is that the observed stellar metallicity distribution shows far fewer metal deficient stars than the predictions of the simplest , closed box models of the galactic disc s chemical evolution .",
    "integrated light studies indicate that the g - dwarf problem is not restricted to our own disc ( worthey et al , 1996 ) but is also found in other galaxies .",
    "there are many ways that the evolutionary models can be modified to bring them into consistency with the observations , such as pre - enrichment of the gas , a time dependent initial mass function or gas infall ( for a review see e.g. pagel , 1997 )    g - dwarfs are sufficiently massive that some of them have begun to evolve away from the main sequence , and these evolutionary corrections must be taken into account when determining their space densities and metallicities .",
    "while these problems are by no means intractable , it has been long recognized that k dwarfs would make for a cleaner sample of the local metal abundance distribution , because for these stars the evolutionary corrections are negligible .",
    "k dwarfs are of course intrinsically fainter , and it has not been until recently that accurate spectroscopic k dwarf abundance analyses have become available , with which to calibrate photometric abundance indicators ( flynn and morell , 1997 ) . as a result",
    ", it is now known that there is a k - dwarf problem which is very similar to the g - dwarf problem ( flynn and morell , 1997 ) .",
    "studies of m dwarfs indicate that the problem is present in these stars too ( mould 1976 ) .",
    "such stars are still not really ideal for measuring the local metallicity distribution , because metallicities for m dwarfs are difficult to determine in the optical ( but appears possible using infrared @xmath0 photometry , ( see e.g. stauffer and hartmann , 1986 ; leggett et al , 2000 ) .",
    "the all sky surveys presently underway in the infrared ( denis , 2mass ) may make such stars viable metallicity tracers in the near future .",
    "the g - dwarf metallicity distribution is already an extensively studied subject ( pagel and patchett , 1975 ; sommer - larsen , 1991 ; wyse and gilmore , 1995 ; rocha - pinto and maciel , 1996 ) and has been used by chemical evolution models to constrain the time scale of the formation of the galactic disc at the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the g - dwarf metallicity distribution can be well fit by models in which gas has been settling onto the disc over a protracted period , of some billion years .",
    "for example , chiappini et al ( 1997 ) , on the basis of the fit of the g - dwarf metallicity distribution , have shown that the disc in the solar neighbourhood was formed on a long time scale of 7 - 8 gyr .",
    "this conclusion has been later stressed also by other authors ( e.g. portinari et al , 1998 ; prantzos and silk , 1998 ; chang et al , 1999 ) .",
    "the release of the data from the european space agency s _ hipparcos _ ( esa , 1997 ) satellite offers a great opportunity to determine the local metallicity distribution of the disc from a complete sample of k dwarfs .",
    "there are three clear improvements because of hipparcos .",
    "firstly , the parallaxes are so accurate that the k dwarfs can be selected by absolute magnitude rather than colour , which is a much better way of isolating stars in a particular mass range .",
    "secondly , the uniformity of the hipparcos data allows us to construct samples with well understood completeness limits .",
    "thirdly , a large fraction of the close binaries can be identified using hipparcos and removed ( since photometric abundance indicators are calibrated for single stars ) .",
    "this last effect turns out to be quite important .    in this paper",
    "we develop a number of simple photometric metallicity indicators for k dwarfs , based on a spectroscopically determined sample of metallicities by flynn and morell ( 1997 ) .",
    "the metallicities for several hundred k dwarfs drawn from the hipparcos catalog have been measured via new observations described here .",
    "this sample has been used to show that there is a very simple relation between the @xmath1 band luminosity @xmath2 of k dwarfs at a given @xmath3 colour and metallicity ( the work is fully described in a companion paper ( kotoneva , flynn and jimenez , 2002 , paper ii ) .",
    "this simple relation is used in this paper to determine metallicities for 431 single k dwarfs in a near complete sample selected from the hipparcos catalog .",
    "we examine a set of isochrones and find a simple relation between the position of a star in the hipparcos colour magnitude diagram and mass .",
    "we are thus able to select a sample of dwarf stars by the more physically relevant parameter of mass , rather than by colour or absolute magnitude , as is usually the case .",
    "the metallicity distribution obtained is then compared to the results of models of the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the selection of the k dwarf sample and in section 3 the observations and reductions of the stars in broadband and intermediate band photometric systems .",
    "the details of the various metallicity calibrations are presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we use isochrones to fit the masses of the stars , and select the stars in an appropriate mass range which is near complete ; we discuss the kinematics of the stars and compute corrections for the metallicity distribution function from the solar volume to the solar cylinder .",
    "the metallicity distribution is compared briefly with other determinations in the literature .",
    "we compare the data to the predictions of a model of the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood due to chiappini et al ( 2001 ) in section 6 .",
    "we draw our conclusions and summarize in section 7 .",
    "our sample of k dwarfs is drawn from the esa hipparcos catalog ( esa , 1997 ) .",
    "for the purposes of this paper we term k dwarfs to be stars of absolute magnitude @xmath2 in the range @xmath4 .",
    "the choice of these absolute magnitude limits is motivated as follows .",
    "the upper magnitude limit at @xmath5 is chosen to avoid the effects of stellar evolution .",
    "examination of theoretical isochrones ( see e.g. jimenez , flynn and kotoneva , 1998 ) indicate that the effects of stellar evolution on luminosity at @xmath6 during the disc lifetime amount to at most @xmath7 magnitude , typically much smaller .",
    "the effects of stellar evolution in constructing the sample are thus small , and negligible compared to the main source of error ( which is poisson sampling statistics ) .",
    "the limit at @xmath6 corresponds to a spectral type of about g8 .",
    "the lower absolute magnitude limit at @xmath8 is the magnitude of the reddest k dwarfs for which our photometric metallicity indicators can currently be calibrated via spectroscopic observations ( flynn and morell , 1997 ) .",
    "the limit at @xmath8 corresponds a spectral type of about k5 .    since we are interested in obtaining a complete sample of k dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood , with which to construct the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) , the stars were initially selected from the `` survey '' part of the hipparcos catalog , which is complete to an apparent visual magnitude given by @xmath9 .",
    "here @xmath10 is the galactic latitude ( the apparent visual magnitude limit was made dependent on @xmath10 in order to avoid observing excessive numbers of stars in the galactic plane ) . adopting this apparent magnitude limit and",
    "the absolute magnitude range @xmath4 resulted in a sample of 209 stars .",
    "our intention had been to get a sample of order 500 - 750 stars . in order to increase our basic sample size",
    ", we increased the magnitude limit by 0.9 mag ( i.e. by taking an apparent magnitude limit of @xmath11 ) we obtained 668 stars ( including the first 209 stars ) .",
    "this is the basic sample which we targeted for observations .",
    "we need to understand the completeness of this basic sample , since it is drawn from stars 0.9 magnitudes fainter than the magnitude limit of the complete part of the hipparcos catalog .",
    "even 0.9 magnitudes beyond the completeness limit , the sample turns out to be still satisfactorily close to complete for our purposes . the completeness level is approximately 94% .",
    "we determined this quantity by using the galactic structure model of holmberg ( 2000 ) .",
    "the model is based on star count data and makes use of both the hipparcos and tycho data ( the latter is complete to much fainter limits than hipparcos ) to construct the luminosity function of the local disc . using the model",
    ", we find that for an apparent magnitude limit of @xmath11 and absolute magnitude limits of @xmath4 , we would expect that some 710 stars should be in our basic sample , whereas there are actually 668 such stars in the hipparcos catalog .",
    "we conclude that even 0.9 magnitudes beyond the `` survey '' completeness limit , hipparcos is substantially ( 94% ) complete in the absolute magnitude range of interest .",
    "stars were observed by hipparcos up to 4 magnitudes fainter than the faintest stars in the `` survey '' .",
    "the 0.9 magnitude extension beyond the survey limit results in a sample which is still over 90% complete . beyond this 0.9 mag limit",
    ", completeness drops rapidly , and the stars in hipparcos become increasingly dominated by objects included for a particular astrophysical interest , such as having a low metallicity and/or high velocity .",
    "there will be a very small excess of such stars in our extended sample , but the high completeness ( 94% ) means that it is other uncertainties ( poisson statistics ) which dominate the construction of the metallicity distribution .",
    "the photometric metallicity indicators described in section 4 were calibrated using spectroscopically determined metallicities for single stars .",
    "we examined the effect that multiple stars would have on our metallicity indicators , by making monte - carlo simulations in which we combined the fluxes of a range of pairings of single k and m dwarfs selected at random from the hipparcos delineated main sequence , and computing the effect on the photometrically determined metallicity .",
    "metallicities for multiple stars were found to be as much as @xmath12 dex lower than the true metallicity .",
    "cleaning the sample of multiple stars thus turned out to be very important .",
    "the hipparcos catalog included a flag for `` probable multiple stars '' , based on the `` reliability of the double or multiple star solution '' .",
    "this flag was used to eliminate all definite , possible and suspected multiple systems .",
    "this reduced the sample from 668 to 449 stars or about 2/3 of the initial sample . despite this expedient ,",
    "a small number of binaries seem to remain in the sample ( of order 10% ) .",
    "this is evident from the positions of the suspected multiples in the colour - magnitude and two colour @xmath3 versus @xmath13 diagrams .",
    "this issue is studied in detail in a companion paper ( kotoneva , flynn and jimenez , 2002 , paper ii ) .",
    "about half of these extra suspected multiples could be removed in constructing the final sample , so the final sample should have a minor contamination by multiples of less than 5% .",
    "note that , by `` single stars '' , we mean only stars which have no companion bright enough to significantly affect the metallicity measurement ( i.e. within 5 magnitudes of the brightness of the primary ) . after removing these suspected multiple stars",
    "the final sample consists of 431 stars .",
    "the colour - magnitude diagrams for our final sample of single stars are shown in fig [ cmd ] .",
    "observations were made at siding spring observatory ( sso ) in australia , between @xmath14 and @xmath15 of march 1999 .",
    "we measured johnson - cousins and strmgren colours for all available southern hemisphere stars of the basic sample using the sso 24  telescope .",
    "we used the motorized filter box with all eight filters @xmath16 and strmgren @xmath17 and @xmath18 . @xmath19 primary standards",
    "were selected from landolt ( 1983a , 1983b , 1992 ) and among e - region standard stars ( graham , 1982 ; menzies et al . , 1989 ) .",
    "strmgren primary standards were selected from the e - regions and also from grnbech , olsen , and strmgren ( 1976 ) and crawford and barnes ( 1970 ) .",
    "hauck and mermilliod ( 1998 ) stars were used as secondary standards for the strmgren system and flynn and morell ( 1997 ) stars for both of the intermediate band systems .",
    "we observed 218 stars and 55 of these more than once .",
    "the standard error in the @xmath20 colour was @xmath21 mag , quite accurate enough for our purposes . in the strmgren bands",
    "the photometric error was slightly higher but still @xmath22 mag .",
    "further data were obtained at la palma using the swedish 60 cm telescope in march 2000 .",
    "an sbig ccd was used to observe in the filters @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "90 stars were observed , most of them more than once .",
    "the scatter for the la palma observations was bit higher than at sso , the scatter in the @xmath13 band being 0.021 for a single observation .",
    "since most of the stars were observed twice the mean error came down to @xmath25 mag .",
    "22 of the stars were observed both in australia and la palma ; the mean difference in @xmath20 was less than 0.01 mag and the scatter was 0.01 mag , so that no significant difference was found between observations taken at the different observatories .",
    "we also obtained @xmath20 colours for 108 stars from bessell ( 1990 ) , who observed all the stars in the gliese catalog .",
    "these are found to be in excellent agreement with our own sso data with a mean difference in @xmath20 of less than 0.01 mag with a scatter of 0.013 mag .",
    "a comparison of the two sources of @xmath13 colour is shown in fig [ bes ] .",
    "we have obtained metallicities for all 431 stars of the dataset . in the end , a single method was used , although we discuss here four metallicity indicators for the dwarfs .",
    "firstly , we used a relation based on geneva and @xmath13 photometry due to flynn and morell ( 1997 ) . secondly , we have developed a very similar method to flynn and morell s based on strmgren and @xmath13 colours .",
    "thirdly , we have found a simple relation between the broadband @xmath3 and @xmath26 colours and metallicity .",
    "fourthly , we have developed in a companion paper ( kotoneva , flynn and jimenez , 2002 ) a metallicity indicator for k dwarfs based on their absolute magnitude in the @xmath1 band relative to a fiducial solar metallicity isochrone .",
    "the first three methods have a similar error 0.2 dex in @xmath27 $ ] , while the last method appears to be better , with an estimated error of 0.1 dex .",
    "this last method depends on the availability of accurate parallaxes for the stars , and so is less generally applicable than those which rely on photmetric colours alone .",
    "the last method is the one we adopt here for measuring the k dwarf metallicities .      to obtain the metallicities for the k dwarfs for which",
    "a geneva @xmath28 colour is available , we used existing relations described in flynn and morell ( 1997 ) .",
    "the @xmath28 colours were obtained from rufener ( 1989 ) for 245 stars and the @xmath20 colours come from our observations and/or from bessell ( 1990 ) . both of the colours were available for 149 stars for which the metallicities , [ fe / h]@xmath29 , were computed using the relation :    @xmath30}_{b_1 } = 8.248\\times b_1 - 12.822\\times ( r - i ) - 4.822.\\ ] ]    these metallicities have a typical error of 0.2 dex .",
    "we have developed a new metallicity indicator for the k dwarfs for which strmgren colours are available .",
    "the calibration was obtained using the 34 g and k dwarfs from flynn and morell ( 1997 ) . for these stars",
    "accurate , spectroscopically determined metallicities , [ fe / h]@xmath31 and effective temperatures have been determined with errors of 0.05 dex and @xmath32 k , respectively .",
    "we searched for a relation between @xmath20 colour , strmgren colours and spectroscopical abundance , @xmath27_{\\mathrm spec}$ ] .",
    "the best fitting strmgren colour was found to be @xmath33 , with a small dependence on @xmath34 .",

    "the dependence on @xmath34 is quite weak , so that while for 54 stars no @xmath34 colour was available , for these stars we adopted a typical value of @xmath38 . adopting this mean",
    "value leads to a very small increase in the metallicity error of @xmath39 0.02 dex .",
    "a check of the strmgren calibration was made using g and k dwarfs in the hyades cluster ( reid , 1993 ; flynn and morell , 1997 ) , using @xmath40 photometry and strmgren @xmath33 colour from the literature ( hauck and mermilliod , 1998 ) . a list of the hyades g and k dwarfs , their magnitudes , @xmath41 , @xmath20 and @xmath33 colours and the metallicities calculated using eqn .

    "the model of galactic chemical evolution we adopt here is that of chiappini et al ( 1997 ) subsequently modified in chiappini et al ( 2001 ) , where a detailed description can be found .",
    "we review here the main ingredients of this model :    * the model assumes that the halo + thick disc and the thin disc are formed during two different infall episodes .",
    "the thin disc does not form out of gas shed from the halo and the thick disc , but simply out of external gas .",
    "such an interpretation is supported by recent dynamical and kinematical studies of stars in the outer galactic halo by sommer - larsen et al ( 1997 ) . under these hypotheses ,",
    "the infall rate is + @xmath42 + where @xmath43 represents the time scale for the formation of the halo and the thick disc , and @xmath44 represents the time scale for disc formation , which is assumed to increase with galactocentric distance .",
    "the best - fit model of chiappini et al ( 2001 ) suggests that the timescale for the formation of the halo and thick disc is quite short and lie in the range @xmath45 gyr , whereas the timescale for the formation of the thin disc is quite long ( @xmath46 gyr for the solar vicinity ) .",
    "this timescale for the thin disc ensures a very good fit of the new data on the g - dwarf metallicity distribution ( wyse and gilmore , 1995 ; rocha - pinto and maciel , 1996 ) . @xmath47 and @xmath48 are derived by the condition of reproducing the present total surface mass density distribution in the solar vicinity .",
    "in other words , we integrate eqn .",
    "[ ab ] over time up to the present and normalise the left hand side by imposing that it is consistent with the disc s present total surface mass density .",
    "@xmath49 is the abundance of the element @xmath50 in the infalling material , @xmath51 the age of the galaxy , assumed to be 14 gyr and @xmath52 is the time of maximum gas accretion onto the disc coincident with the end of the halo - thick disc phase . *",
    "the galactic thin disc is approximated by several independent rings , 2 kpc wide , without exchange of matter between them .",
    "continuous infall of gas ensures the temporal increase of the surface mass density @xmath53 in each ring .",
    "* the instantaneous recycling approximation is relaxed .",
    "this is of fundamental importance in treating those isotopes , such as @xmath54n and @xmath55fe , which are mostly produced by long - lived stars . *",
    "the prescription for the star formation rate ( sfr ) is : + @xmath56 + where @xmath53 is the total surface mass density and @xmath57 is the surface gas density and @xmath58 and @xmath59 . a threshold in the surface gas density is also assumed ; when the gas density drops below this threshold the star formation stops .",
    "two different values for the gas density threshold are assumed for the halo - thick disc ( @xmath60 ) and the thin - disc ( @xmath61 ) phases .",
    "the existence of such a threshold has been suggested by star formation studies ( kennicutt , 1989 ) .",
    "* for the initial mass function ( imf ) we adopt the prescriptions of scalo ( 1986 ) . * the contributions to the chemical enrichment from supernovae of different type ( ia , ib and ii ) as well as from stars dying as c - o white dwarfs and contributing processed and unprocessed elements through stellar winds and the planetary nebula phase",
    "are taken into account in great detail ( see chiappini et al , 2001 ) .",
    "* the adopted nucleosynthesis prescriptions are from : ( a ) van den hoek and groenewegen ( 1997 ) for low and intermediate stellar masses and ( b ) thielemann et al ( 1993 ) and nomoto et al ( 1997 ) for sne ia . for the massive stars we considered the yields of woosley and weaver ( 1995 ) ( case b ) which include explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "the model computes the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) assuming no observational or cosmic scatter .",
    "the observational scatter in the metallicities for the k dwarfs is 0.1 dex ( see section [ metscatt ] ) .",
    "this is quite small relative to the width of the observed mdf ; the model can be easily convolved to take this into account when comparing to the data .",
    "potentially more important is the cosmic , or intrinsic scatter , in the metallicities of co - eval stars .",
    "there is unfortunately no clear consensus presently regarding the amount of cosmic scatter .",
    "edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found that the age - metallicity relation for f and g dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood shows a scatter of order 0.2 dex , which was larger than expected considering the uncertainties in metallicities and ages .",
    "this is of the order the width of the mdf , i.e. most of the mdf is accounted for by cosmic scatter , and the increase in the mean metallicity as a function of time plays a minor role .",
    "however , as discussed by garnett and kobulnicky ( 2000 ) the large scatter found for the stars in the solar vicinity is inconsistent with the abundance measurements in nearby spiral and irregular galaxies ( e.g. kobulnicky and skillman , 1996 ) and in the local ism ( meyer , jura and cardelli , 1998 ) , which show that dispersions in ism abundances are rather small on kiloparsec scales or less . by reanalyzing the edvardsson et al .",
    "sample together with hipparcos parallaxes and new age estimates , garnett and kobulnicky ( 2000 ) found that the scatter in the age - metallicity relation depends on the distance to the stars in the sample .",
    "they concluded that the intrinsic dispersion in metallicity at fixed age is less than 0.15 dex for field stars in the solar neighbourhood , which is closer to the estimate of less than 0.1 dex for galactic open star clusters and the ism ( twarog et al . 1997 ) .",
    "feltzing , holmberg and hurley ( 2001 ) argue also this view from a sample 5828 hipparcos stars for which they derive metallicities and ages ; they find a large scatter in metallicity at any given age and even question the existance of the age - metallicity relation itself .",
    "rocha - pinto et al ( 2000 ) argue for a very small cosmic scatter , @xmath62 dex , based on the age - metallicity relation they present for nearby stars .    as is well known ( pagel and tautvaisiene , 1995 ) the metallicity distribution function is a very poor test of the age - metallicity relation",
    ", so we can not resolve this issue here .",
    "we note that the amr is less robust than the mdf . in the case of the mdf",
    "both quantities are directly observable ( number of stars and metallicity ) , while in the case of the amr the age scatter contributes significantly to the apparent metallicity scatter and is not easy to quantify .",
    "we will take the view that the amount of cosmic scatter is uncertain and we will keep it as a free parameter in the model fitting .      the metallicity distribution function for the model is compared to the data in fig [ modelcomp ] .",
    "the model is a good fit .",
    "the data are shown in all panels by circles and with error bars based on the poissonian sampling error ( for the 220 star sample ) .",
    "the solid line shows the model results based on the woosley and weaver ( 1995 ) and van den hoek and groenewegen ( 1997 ) yields .",
    "this model is normalized to the value of the metallicity after @xmath63 gyr ( i.e. when the sun was born ) . in the lower left panel of fig [ modelcomp ]",
    "the curves show the unconvolved model . in the remaining panels",
    "the model is convolved by a gaussian representing the observational and cosmic scatter .",
    "the effect of the observational scatter alone is shown in the lower right panel ( 0.1 dex ) .",
    "the upper left panel shows the convolved model for a total scatter of 0.15 dex , equivalent to 0.1 dex observational scatter and 0.11 dex of cosmic scatter , and the upper right panel shows a total scatter of 0.2 dex , equivalent to 0.1 dex observational scatter and 0.17 dex of cosmic scatter .",
    "clearly , for this model , we can not constrain the cosmic scatter beyond noting that it is less than 0.2 dex , and probably less than 0.15 dex .",
    "this is consistent with existing direct observational constraints ( section [ cosscatter ] .",
    "we conclude that the agreement of the model prediction with the observed k - dwarf distribution is excellent , for any reasonable adopted cosmic scatter .",
    "an independent analysis of the width of the main sequence in the hipparcos colour magnitude diagram by girardi ( 2002 , private communication ) has also obtained the result that the cosmic abundance scatter is probably less than 0.2 dex .",
    "we have calibrated several photometric abundance indices for k dwarfs based on a sample of 34 g and k dwarfs with accurate , spectroscopically determined metallicities .",
    "two of the indices use cousins @xmath64 photometry to estimate stellar effective temperature and the geneva @xmath28 or strmgren @xmath33 and @xmath34 colours .",
    "these indices give metallicity estimates of @xmath65 dex accuracy .",
    "a third metallicity index uses @xmath3 and @xmath26 broadband colours .",
    "a fourth metallicity index , described in detail in a companion paper ( kotoneva , flynn and jimenez 2002 , paper ii ) , is based on absolute magnitude @xmath2 and @xmath3 colour .",
    "these latter two indices appear to provide metallicities of @xmath62 dex accuracy .    for a set of newly acquired observations of k dwarfs",
    ", we use one of these indices to obtain the metallicity distribution of a near complete sample of k dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood drawn from the hipparcos catalog .",
    "care has been taken to remove the multiple stars from the sample , for which metallicities can not be measured accurately . through isochrones",
    "we assign masses to the k dwarfs , and select those k dwarfs which fall into a mass window @xmath66 m / m@xmath67 , within which the sample is near to complete .",
    "this yields a sample of 220 k dwarfs .",
    "the metallicity distribution of the 220 k dwarfs is strongly peaked near the solar metallicity , confirming the existence of the `` g dwarf problem '' amongst k dwarfs , as seen in several earlier studies ( marsakov and shevelev ( 1988 ) , flynn and morell ( 1997 ) and rocha - pinto and maciel ( 1998 ) .",
    "we compare the metallicity distribution with galactic chemical evolution models of chiappini et al ( 2001 ) . in the context of this model of the metallicity evolution , we find that the amount of cosmic scatter in the metallicities is small , not more than 0.15 dex .",
    "the model match the data well , indicating that the disc was formed via infall processes over an extended time scale of order 7 gyr .",

    "<S> k - dwarfs have life - times older than the present age of the galactic disc , and are thus ideal stars to investigate the disc s chemical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed several photometric metallicity indicators for k dwarfs , based an a sample of accurate spectroscopic metallicities for 34 disc and halo g and k dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> the photometric metallicities lead us to develop a metallicity index for k dwarfs based only on their position in the colour absolute - magnitude diagram . </S>",
    "<S> metallicities have been determined for 431 single k dwarfs drawn from the hipparcos catalog , selecting the stars by absolute magnitude and removing multiple systems . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is essentially a complete reckoning of the metal content in nearby k dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we use stellar isochrones to mark the stars by mass , and select a subset of 220 of the stars which is complete in a narrow mass interval . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the data with a model of the chemical evolution of the solar cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> we find that only a modest cosmic scatter is required to fit our age metallicity relation . </S>",
    "<S> the model assumes two main infall episodes for the formation of the halo - thick disc and thin disc respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the new data confirms that the solar neighbourhood formed on a long timescale of order 7 gyr .    </S>",
    "<S> = -1.0 cm    stars - k - dwarfs , abundances ; photometry - johnson - cousin , strmgren and geneva systems </S>"
