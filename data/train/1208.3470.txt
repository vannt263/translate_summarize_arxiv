    "gate tunable anderson localization of dirac electrons is inaccessible in standard field effect heterostructures due to the strong disorder - induced inhomogeneity of the local doping level ( electron - hole puddles )  @xcite ubiquitous in the materials that show dirac - like low energy spectrum , such as graphene  @xcite or topological insulator surfaces  @xcite .",
    "basically , the low - density localization behavior of graphene is inaccessible experimentally because the dirac point itself is inaccessible due to the formation of electron - hole puddles around the charge neutrality point .",
    "however , very recently , a novel double layer graphene ( dlg ) heterostructure containing two graphene layers separated by an insulator allowed using additional screening effect of the second graphene layer to access a metal - insulator transition regime .",
    "anomalously large resistance , @xmath0 , in combination with insulating temperature dependence was observed in these experiments suggestive of a metal insulator transition ( mit )  @xcite .",
    "the physical nature of this behavior is currently a topic of a debate  @xcite . in particular , whether the transport data of ref .",
    "represent an effective low - density high - temperature semi - classical resistivity  @xcite or a low temperature strong anderson localization crossover behavior  @xcite is unclear at this stage .    on the one hand",
    "suppressing inhomogeneity allows access to the low - density regime @xmath1 in which anderson physics is expected to dominate ( here @xmath2 is the fermi wavevector and @xmath3 is the mean free path ) . in this regime , quantum interference of the two flavors ( due to two valleys ) of chiral dirac",
    "charge carriers in graphene may result in the insulating behavior in the case of sufficient mixing of the flavors by atomic - scale disorder  @xcite . on the other hand , the experiments of ref .",
    "were restricted to a fairly high temperature regime ( 10 - 100k ) where quantum interference effects may be suppressed due to short phase breaking length . the observed mit is also in contrast with more recent transport measurements on ultra high quality suspended devices  @xcite in which an extremely low density inhomogeneity is achieved , @xmath4 , nevertheless no mit is detected ( see also more recent experiment ref .  ) . moreover ,",
    "an anderson insulator would be characterized by the resistivity growing exponentially with decreasing temperature whereas the data  @xcite demonstrates only a roughly power law growth . insulating power law temperature dependence ( resistivity growing with decreasing temperature ) is not unusual near charge neutrality in graphene ( see fig .  2 in ref .  , and measurements on other low  @xcite and high  @xcite mobility samples ) .",
    "this behavior is explained by the combined effect of temperature dependent screening  @xcite thermal excitation of electrons from the valence band and thermally activated hopping of electrons over the potential barriers between electron - hole puddles  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , very high values of resistance reported in ref .  ,",
    "@xmath0 suggest a novel behavior in this system possibly associated with mit .",
    "however , an alternative explanation for the observed behavior was recently suggested  @xcite , in which case the anomalous resistance is explained by a boltzmann transport effect combined with strong suppression of inhomogeneity in dlg  @xcite .",
    "the latter work is phenomenological and relies on the assumptions of the quasiclassical transport formalism and the phase breaking length being shorter than the elastic scattering length .",
    "therefore a more detailed analysis of quantum effects is required to justify the applicability of the latter approach .",
    "one way to make progress in the understanding of the observed behavior of the resistivity in these new devices is to analyze the metallic regime where perturbation expansion in disorder strength may be applied .",
    "such theoretical analysis of the quantum interference effect in the higher - density weak localization regime of the dlg system , which must be a precursor to any low - density strong localization crossover phenomenon , is one of the main goals of our work .    in this paper",
    "we consider the effect of gate tunable screening provided by the additional layer in dlgs on transport characteristics of these devices .",
    "screening affects both the potential of charged defects and coulomb interactions of charge carriers . taking into account both effects",
    "we analyze the classical and quantum parts of the resistivity of graphene in dlg geometry in the metallic regime @xmath5 .",
    "we consider only low temperature regime such that elastic scattering by the disorder limits the transport characteristics and all inelastic scattering effects may be included perturbatively .",
    "below we outline the results of the following analysis : ( i ) we develop a framework describing the screening effect of the two graphene layers in dlg on the coulomb potential of charged defects in dlg heterostructure .",
    "( ii ) we generalize the self - consistent theory of disorder induced electron density fluctuations at neutrality point of graphene  @xcite ( electron - hole puddles ) and use it to estimate the screening effect of dlg on the amplitude of the electron density fluctuations .",
    "( iii ) we analyze the effect of screening in dlg on the elastic scattering rate due to charged defects that determines the extent of gate tunability of mobility in dlg .",
    "( iv ) we analyze the effect of the screening in dlg on the dephasing rate due to inelastic electron - electron collisions .",
    "( v ) we analyze the combined effect of screening on the weak localization correction to the resistivity ( vi ) we predict a peculiar gate tunable magneto - resistance in the high quality dlg structures with mixed elastic scattering mechanisms .",
    "the present work is limited to the perturbative metallic regime and can not make any definitive conclusions about the regime of the low density studied in the experiments of ref .  .",
    "however , the theoretical framework developed below provides a basis for analysis of a more detailed gate tunable quantum transport measurements which would allow characterization of various microscopic scattering mechanisms that determine the behavior of the system in the low density regime .",
    "in particular , we believe that it is imperative that we understand the high - density metallic regime of the dlg transport in some depth before trying to understand the low - density crossover mit regime since a systematic perturbative theory is available in the higher density regime whereas the low - density regime is inaccessible to analytical theory .",
    "we hope that our work would motivate experimental work focusing on the metallic regime of dlg in order to investigate conceptually important question of anderson localization and metal - insulator transition in graphene .",
    "we consider a dlg consisting of two layers of graphene , `` studied '' and `` control '' , see fig .",
    "[ fig0:sketch ] , which are used for resistivity measurements and to provide the additional screening effect , respectively .",
    "the two layers are separated by a thin layer , @xmath6 , of insulating hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) that is thick enough to suppress direct tunneling between the layers .",
    "the whole structure is separated by a thick layer , @xmath7 , of hbn from the standard sio@xmath8/si substrate .",
    "the combination of the top and bottom gates in this heterostructure allows independent `` control '' of the electron densities @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the `` control '' and `` studied '' layers respectively .",
    "this setup is motivated by the design of heterostructures in ref .  .",
    "we assume that the mobility of the `` studied '' layer is limited by elastic scattering of charged impurities in accordance with the data  @xcite .",
    "the additional screening effect of the `` control '' layer is expected to suppress the electron - hole puddles in the `` studied '' layer .",
    "we find that the effectiveness of the `` control '' layer screening strongly depends on the position of impurities in the dlg .",
    "it is efficient for the relatively small concentration of charged defects on top of the `` control '' layer , whereas it leads to only a moderate suppression of the inhomogeneity induced by charges in close proximity of the `` studied '' layer and by the remote charged defects in sio@xmath8 substrate .",
    "the latter inefficiency stems from the very high densities of charged defects in the sio@xmath8 substrate , @xmath11 , that would require screening charge density in the `` control '' layer several times @xmath12 which is beyond the experimentally accessible range .",
    "moreover , the nonlinear screening effects in the electron - hole puddle regime in the `` studied '' layer work against the screening effect of the `` control '' layer making the screening less efficient .",
    "the situation is slightly different in the case of elastic relaxation rate due to charged defects .",
    "the screening by `` control '' layer is more efficient in this case and leads to the suppression of the classical part of the resistivity near the dirac point of the `` studied '' layer .",
    "the resulting behavior of the resistivity as a function of the density in the `` control '' layer is a result of a competition of the suppression of electron - hole puddles that increases the resistivity and suppression of the elastic relaxation rate that decreases the resistivity .",
    "below we also demonstrate that the ratio of momentum relaxation rate to the transport rate varies substantially with the distance between graphene and charged defects .",
    "therefore measurement of the two elastic relaxation rates can be used to determine the location of charged defects limiting the mobility in dlg .",
    "transport scattering rate can be extracted from boltzmann resistivity .",
    "the momentum relaxation rate characterizes the broadening of single particle states and can be extracted from the decay of shubnikov de haas oscillations . a similar technique",
    "@xcite has been successfully applied to the analysis of the standard graphene based field effect transistors  @xcite . since our work establishes that the inhomogeneous puddles induced by the distant charged impurities in sio@xmath8 can be suppressed only partially by the control layer screening , it is important to know where the dominant charged impurities reside and the measurement of the single - particle momentum relaxation ( sometimes also called the quantum scattering ) time could help locate the charged impurities in the dlg system .",
    "and @xmath13 considered in the text .",
    ", scaledwidth=25.0% ]    very high values of the mobility of the `` studied '' layer encapsulated in hbn that is tunable in the range @xmath14 with the screening density in `` control '' layer @xmath9 indicate the dominant role of the charged defects in the elastic scattering in this system .",
    "furthermore , the very high value of the observed  @xcite maximum of the gate tunable mobility suggests a weak effect of neutral ( immune to screening ) elastic scattering mechanisms that break locally the lattice symmetry of graphene . therefore these dlgs may demonstrate quantum interference behavior distinct from that observed in typical graphene flakes  @xcite where strong lattice symmetry breaking disorder determines predominantly weak - localization behavior",
    "this is especially so at relatively low densities @xmath10 at which the effect of trigonal warping of the fermi line  @xcite can be neglected .",
    "two identical carbon atoms in the unit cell of graphene give rise to two degenerate flavors ( valleys ) of chiral dirac charge carriers in its electronic spectrum confined to the vicinities of the two inequivalent corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "quantum interference of two independent flavors of dirac quasiparticles is associated with weak anti - localization behavior  @xcite .",
    "the latter is however protected only by the symmetry between the two sublattices in graphene , which can be easily broken by impurities .",
    "therefore quantum interference in graphene is very sensitive to the presence of elastic scattering mechanisms that break lattice symmetry .",
    "generic time inversion symmetric disorder in graphene can be categorized into three types according to their effect on quantum interference : ( i ) potential of the charged defects that does not break lattice symmetry ; ( ii ) smooth random vector potential disorder that breaks the symmetry between the two carbon atoms in the unit cell of graphene ( intravalley disorder ) ; ( iii ) atomic scale disorder that breaks lattice symmetry and causes mixing of the two valleys ( intervalley disorder ) .",
    "random vector potential disorder leads to suppression of the weak - antilocalization effect whereas the intervalley scattering restores the weak localization behavior typical for two dimensional electron gas . in the case of high quality dlg heterostructures with very weak lattice symmetry breaking scattering weak antilocalization effect of dirac electrons",
    "plays an important role .",
    "additional screening in dlg affects only the scattering rate due to charged defects in graphene and therefore changes the relative strength of intra and inter valley defects with respect to the strength of potential scatterers .",
    "this results in the dependence of quantum correction on the electron density in the `` control '' layer @xmath9 . in particular",
    ", an interesting possibility arises that the intervalley elastic scattering , while being unimportant in determining the semiclassical boltzmann resistivity , becomes important in determining the tuning of the quantum interference correction from anti - localization to localization .    in a wide temperature range quantum interference",
    "is limited by decoherence rate due to inelastic electron - electron collisions .",
    "the latter is strongly affected by the screening effect in dlg for two reasons : due to suppression of the coulomb interaction between charge carriers , and due to enhancement of the diffusion coefficient that reduces the time electrons spend in proximity of each other where interaction is the strongest .",
    "the combination of these two effects results in strong variation of the decoherence rate with the screening density .",
    "this gives rise to a peculiar gate tunable quantum correction to the resistivity of graphene in dlg devices which may change sign depending on the screening density in the `` control '' layer especially at higher temperatures .",
    "it should be emphasized that this gate - tunable quantum correction to the boltzmann resistivity is manifest only when the phase breaking length is much larger than the elastic mean free path , i.e. at lower temperatures , so that the quantum interference is operational .",
    "since our theory treats the quantum correction perturbatively , it applies only in the metallic regime at densities well above the crossover to strong anderson localization .",
    "the most striking consequence of the gate tunable quantum correction can be observed in the intermediate density regime in which the transport in the `` studied '' layer is metallic , @xmath15 , whence the fermi energy is low enough so that the trigonal warping effect is negligible .",
    "the quantum correction in this case is strongly dependent on the electron density in the `` control '' layer . at sufficiently strong dephasing rate ( sufficiently high temperature )",
    "this results in a gate tunable crossover from weak - antilocalizaiton type magnetoresistance to weak - localization type .",
    "a similar crossover that was temperature driven was demonstrated in graphene previously  @xcite , our work demonstrates a similar tunability with the gate voltage in dlg systems .",
    "quantum part of the resistivity also includes altshuler - aronov correction to the conductivity due to the electron - electron interactions  @xcite which typically has the sign enhancing the localizaiton effect and is expected to be suppressed by the additional screening effect which typically reduces the interaction strength .",
    "this does not have any effect on low field magnetoresistance which allows to study the quantum interference ( weak localization ) correction separately .",

    "weak localization originates from the interference contribution to the probability to scatter backwards .",
    "the latter is given by the modulus square of the sum of the quantum mechanical amplitudes @xmath118 associated with each possible backscattered trajectory , @xmath119 .",
    "this contains the classical part , @xmath120 , and the quantum interference contribution , @xmath121 .",
    "the latter vanishes for generic trajectories .",
    "however , in case @xmath122 is a time reversal image of @xmath118 , which is possible for loop - shaped self - intersecting trajectories , the phase factors cancel exactly , @xmath123 .",
    "therefore the average contribution of this special type of trajectories to the backscattering probability is non - zero .",
    "@xmath124 for a given self - intersecting trajectory is proportional to the ratio of the width of the trajectory @xmath125 to the 2d volume @xmath126 that can be spanned by diffusion during time @xmath127 .",
    "the resulting correction to the conductivity @xmath128 is proportional to the log of the ratio of the travel times along the longest @xmath129 and the shortest @xmath130 trajectories and is typically of the order of the conductance quantum .",
    "the longest trajectories @xmath129 that limit the extent of quantum interference are given by either the system size or by phase breaking effects .",
    "two degenerate flavors ( two valleys ) of chiral dirac fermions in graphene are characterized by an isospin degree of freedom that has a fixed projection on the direction of momentum .",
    "therefore backscattering of chiral charge carriers is accompanied by the reversal of isospin which gives rise to an additional phase difference @xmath131 between the two images of a looped backscattered trajectory , where @xmath132 is the winding number of the trajectory .",
    "the interference contribution to conductivity in this case acquires an additional minus sign which results in anti - localization  @xcite effect in contrast to the usual weak localization in 2d  @xcite . in realistic devices the vector potential ( intravalley ) disorder , characterized by a phenomenological rate @xmath133 , breaks the symmetry between the two sublattices of graphene and therefore suppresses the anti - localization effect . atomic scale disorder , characterized by @xmath134 , scatters electrons between different valleys and therefore restores the localization sign of the interference correction .",

    "microscopic origin of the intervalley scattering at intermediate densities therefore deserves a more careful consideration .",
    "electrostatic potential can give rise to a strong intervalley scattering only if its amplitude is larger than the bandwidth in which case the lowest order born approximation is insufficient , see appendix and ref .   for details .",
    "such strong potentials can be induced by lattice defects and adsorbate molecules chemically bound to carbon atoms of the graphene lattice .",

    "since potential , intravalley and intervalley elastic scattering affect quantum localization properties qualitatively differently , our work must include all mechanisms in the presence of `` control '' layer screening with equivalent considerations for all scattering processes contributing to the semiclassical and the quantum part of graphene resistivity . since the phase breaking length arising from inelastic scattering processes is an important ingredient in determining localization effects arising from quantum interference",
    ", we consider electron - electron interaction induced inelastic phase decoherence effects in our theory , neglecting electron - phonon interaction which is known to be weak in graphene  @xcite .",

    "we concentrate on low - temperature transport at relatively high `` metallic '' densities where the quantum interference contribution to the resistivity can be treated as a perturbative weak localization correction to the semiclassical boltzmann resistivity .",
    "this precludes us from commenting directly on the very low density nonperturbative insulating behavior ( as observed in ref .  ) from the perspective of strong anderson localization phenomenon , but our theory establishes the clear possibility of a gate - tunable transition from weak anti - localization to weak localization behavior in graphene at metallic densities , which would be a necessary precursor to a possible strong localization crossover behavior at low densities .",
    "whether such a weak localization transition , which must precede any strong localization induced low density metal - insulator transition , is operational in ref .",
    "was unfortunately not studied there , and the prediction of such a gate - tunable transition in the weak localization behavior is an important new prediction of our work .",
    "we emphasize that such transition must be studied at relatively low temperatures , and it may be missed at the higher temperature range ( 10 - 100k ) of study used in ref .  .",
    "in addition , the strong localization induced insulating behavior at low carrier density should be exponential in temperature , and not a power law as observed in ref .  .",
    "given our concrete theoretical predictions , we hope that future experiments on dlg systems will resolve the important question of a possible low - density quantum localization transition in clean graphene .",
    "our work shows that it is possible for the intervalley scattering in graphene to be strong enough to induce localization , but at the same time be weak enough not to strongly suppress high - density mobility , particularly in the presence of screening by the `` control '' layer .    in conclusion",

    "<S> we analyze the effect of screening provided by the additional graphene layer in double layer graphene heterostructures ( dlgs ) on transport characteristics of dlg devices in the metallic regime . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of gate - tunable charge density in the additional layer is two - fold : it provides screening of the long - range potential of charged defects in the system , and screens out coulomb interactions between charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the efficiency of defect charge screening is strongly dependent on the concentration and location of defects within the dlg . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , only a moderate suppression of electron - hole puddles around the dirac point induced by the high concentration of remote impurities in the silicon oxide substrate could be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> a stronger effect is found on the elastic relaxation rate due to charged defects resulting in mobility strongly dependent on the electron denisty in the additional layer of dlg . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the quantum interference correction to the resistivity of graphene is also strongly affected by screening in dlg . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the dephasing rate is strongly suppressed by the additional screening that suppresses the amplitude of electron - electron interaction and reduces the diffusion time that electrons spend in proximity of each other . the latter effect combined with screening of elastic relaxation rates results in a peculiar gate tunable weak - localization magnetoresistance and quantum correction to resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> we propose suitable experiments to test our theory and discuss the possible relevance of our results to existing data . </S>"
