    "strange hadron production is sensitive to parton dynamics in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the enhanced production of strange hadrons in nucleus - nucleus collisions with respect to proton - proton collisions at the same energy has been suggested as a signature of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation in these collisions @xcite .",

    "substantial strangeness enhancement has indeed been observed , especially for multi - strange hyperons .",

    "baryon - to - meson ratios in more central au+au collisions at @xmath5 = 200 gev are much higher compared to those in elementary collisions @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the parton recombination picture for hadron formation @xcite .",
    "such models require constituent quarks to coalesce into hadrons , and hence the observed enhancement of baryon - to - meson ratios at intermediate @xmath9 is an important evidence for the formation of deconfined matter with partonic degrees of freedom @xcite . at high @xmath9 ( @xmath12 gev/@xmath11 ) , the suppression of hadron yields in central au+au collisions at @xmath13 gev compared to peripheral collisions is considered as a strong evidence of partonic energy loss in the dense partonic medium @xcite .",
    "because of the possible transition from partonic dominated phase to hadronic dominated phase , it is expected that the established paradigm for partonic degrees of freedom at top rhic energy may break at a given low collision energy . in order to locate the phase transition boundary , it will be quite interesting to measure the energy evolution of baryon - to - meson ratios and nuclear modification factors ( @xmath14 , defined later ) .    with its large acceptance",
