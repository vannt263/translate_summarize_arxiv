    "first data reported by the star collaboration at rhic @xcite has a significant meaning that the observed large magnitude of elliptic flow for charged hadrons is consistent with hydrodynamic predictions @xcite .",
    "this suggests that large pressure possibly in the partonic phase is built at the early stage ( @xmath0 fm/@xmath1 ) in au+au collisions at @xmath2 130 and 200 gev .",
    "this situation at rhic is in contrast to that at lower energies such as ags or sps where hydrodynamics always overpredicts the data @xcite .",
    "moreover , this also suggests that the effect of the viscosity in the qgp phase is remarkably small and that the qgp is almost a perfect fluid @xcite .",
    "hadronic transport models are very good to describe experimental data at lower energies , while they fail to reproduce such large values of elliptic flow parameter at rhic ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "so the importance of hydrodynamics is rising in heavy ion physics .",
    "after the first star data were published @xcite , other groups at rhic have also obtained the data concerning with flow phenomena @xcite .",
    "contrary to the success of the hydrodynamics to describe the elliptic flow , many dynamical models including hydrodynamics can not reproduce the hbt radii @xcite .",
    "it is known as the  hbt puzzle \" .    to understand these experimental data ,",
    "hydrodynamic analyses are performed extensively @xcite . in this short review",
    ", we highlight several results mainly on elliptic flow and on the hbt radii from hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "hydrodynamic equations represent the energy - momentum conservations @xmath3 . in the ideal hydrodynamics ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor becomes @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the energy density , @xmath6 is the pressure , and @xmath7 is the four fluid velocity .",
    "when there are conserved quantities such as the baryon number or the number of chemically frozen hadrons , one needs to solve the continuity equations @xmath8 together with the hydrodynamic equations . in order to close the system of partial differential equations , the equation of state ( eos )",
    "@xmath9 is needed .",
    "the naive applicability conditions of ideal hydrodynamics are that the mean free path among the particles is much smaller than the typical size of the system and that the system keeps local thermal equilibrium during expansion . from these conditions",
    ", one can not use hydrodynamics for initial collisions , final free streaming and high @xmath10 ( @xmath11 2 gev/@xmath1 ) particles .",
    "so one needs an interface between the pre - thermalisation stage and the hydrodynamic stage at the initial time .",
    "moreover , the system eventually breaks up and can not keep thermalisation at the later stage .",
    "this means a prescription of freezeout is needed in the hydrodynamic model in evaluating the particle spectra .",
    "therefore one needs another interface between the hydrodynamic stage and the free streaming stage . in what follows ,",
    "we discuss particularly equations of state , initial conditions and freezeout prescriptions used in the literature .",
    "the main ingredient of the hydrodynamic model is the equation of state ( eos ) for thermalised matter produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "ideally , one uses the eos taken from the first principle calculations of qcd , namely , lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "more practically , one can use the resonance gas model for the hadron phase and the massless free parton gas for the qgp phase . by matching these two models at the critical temperature ,",
    "one obtains the first order phase transition model with a latent heat @xmath121 gev/@xmath13 . in the mixed phase at @xmath14",
    ", the sound velocity @xmath15 is vanishing .",
    "recent lattice qcd simulations tell us that the phase transition seems to be crossover in vanishing baryonic chemical potential .",
    "discontinuity of the thermodynamic variables does not exist in the crossover phase transition .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that the energy density and the entropy density increase more rapidly than the pressure in the vicinity of the phase transition region @xmath16 .",
    "this also leads to very small sound velocity near the phase transition region .",
    "therefore it is very hard in general to find flow observables which distinguish the crossover phase transition with a rapid change of the thermodynamic variables from the first order phase transition .",
    "once initial conditions are assigned , one can numerically simulate the space - time evolution of thermalised matter which is governed by hydrodynamic equations .",
    "usually , initial conditions are parametrised based on some physical assumptions .",
    "transverse profile of the energy / entropy density is assumed to be proportional to the number density of participants @xmath17 , the number density of binary collisions @xmath18 or linear combination of them .",
    "initial transverse flow is usually taken to be vanishing .",
    "on the other hand , one can introduce model calculations to obtain the initial condition of hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "event generators can be used to obtain the energy density distribution at the initial time .",
    "recently , the spherio group employs an event generator nexus and takes an initial condition from this model in the event - by - event basis @xcite .",
    "the resultant energy density distribution in the transverse plane has highly bumpy structures @xcite .",
    "smooth initial conditions used in the conventional hydrodynamic simulations are no longer expected in one event . another important example which is relevant at very high collision energies is an initial condition taken from the colour glass condensate picture .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent calculations .      conventional prescription to obtain the invariant momentum spectra from the hydrodynamic simulations is to employ the cooper - frye formula @xcite .",
    "the physical picture described by the cooper - frye formula is sometimes called  sudden freezeout \" since the mean free path is suddenly changed from zero to infinity through a thin freezeout hypersurface . instead of using this",
    ", one can use a hadronic cascade model to describe the space - time evolution of hadrons @xcite .",
    "the mean free path among hadrons is finite and depends on hadronic species .",
    "hence , one can describe a continuous freezeout picture through hadronic transport models .",
    "note that continuous particle emission can be considered within the hydrodynamics @xcite .",

    "it is of importance to study whether the agreement with the experimental data still holds even when the assumption of chemical equilibrium in the hadron phase is abandoned @xcite .",

    "[ fig : v2pt ] ( right ) .",
    "the deviation might come from a common origin @xcite : the small multiplicity both in forward rapidity region at the rhic energy and at midrapidity at the lower collision energies could cause the partial thermalisation . in the low density limit , @xmath19 is actually proportional to the number density @xcite .",
    "the shape of @xmath24 data in forward rapidity region looks similar to that of the pseudorapidity distributions @xcite .",

    "the excitation function in the case of the latent heat @xmath27 gev/@xmath13 linearly increases with the multiplicity , which is consistent with the experimental data .",
    "the difference from the conventional hydrodynamic results might come from the strong viscosity in the hadron phase within the cascade calculation .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath22 , its mass dependences and particle spectra / ratio at midrapidity are also reproduced by this hybrid model @xcite .",
    "although many hydrodynamic calculations are already performed , one does not succeed to interpret the hbt puzzle yet .",
    "the main reason why the hydrodynamic simulations overestimate the @xmath28 is the negative value of the correlation between @xmath29 and @xmath30 which comes from the hydrodynamic source function  @xcite . here @xmath31 and the average is taken over the source function .",
    "note that positive @xmath29-@xmath30 correlation can be obtained dynamically in a transport model @xcite .",
    "so detailed comparison of this result with hydrodynamic results would be important in understanding the space - time evolution of matter in heavy ion collisions .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : freezeout ] , the conventional hydrodynamics assumes the sudden freezeout which must be far from the realistic situation .",
