    "the magellanic clouds provide an excellent example of interacting , metal - poor dwarf galaxies on our own doorstep , with neutral hydrogen maps revealing large structures such as the magellanic bridge ( which connects the clouds ) , and the extensive magellanic stream and leading arm ( e.g. , putman 2000 ) . the bridge is linked to the eastern side of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) by an extended ` wing ' , which has a lower content of gas , dust and stars than the main body of the smc , suggesting it should be unfavourable to star formation .",

    "sk183 was observed as part of the larger survey of the region with the medusa - fibre mode of flames , using three of the standard settings of the giraffe spectrograph : lr02 , lr03 , and hr15n , delivering spectral resolving powers of 7000 , 8500 , and 16000 , respectively ( e.g. evans et al . 2011 ) .",
    "individual exposure times were 1800s for all settings .",
    "the eso common pipeline library flames reduction routines ( v.2.8.7 ) were used for the standard processing stages , i.e. bias subtraction , fibre location , summed extractions , division by a normalized flat - field , and wavelength calibration .",

    "2011 ) .",
    "qualitative inspection of the spectra revealed no evidence of radial velocity variations associated with binarity , further supported by the measurements in section  [ rv ] .",
    "thus , the spectra from each exposure / setting were co - added , yielding a signal - to - noise ratio in excess of 250 per rebinned pixel from the pipeline .",
    "however , note that the observations only spanned three nights , so our detection sensitivity to radial velocity variations from anything but a short - period companion will have been low .",
    "there are archival , low - dispersion observations of sk183 from the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ from hutchings et al .",
    "although at low resolution , the lack of strong uv emission - lines is evident ( see figure  4 from hutchings et al . ) , consistent with the weak wind - profiles seen in other massive stars in the smc , e.g. walborn et al .",

    "observations with the short - wavelength _ wise _ bands ( @xmath371 and @xmath372 , corresponding to 3.6 and 4.6@xmath38 m , respectively ) are in good agreement with the predicted flux from our powr models . but at the longer wavelengths of the @xmath373 and @xmath374 bands ( 12 and 22@xmath38 m ) , there is a clear mid - ir excess compared to the predicted distribution .",
