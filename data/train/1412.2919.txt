    "xmmu122939.7 + 075333 , which is coincident with a spectrally confirmed globular cluster ( rz2109 ) in the massive virgo elliptical galaxy ngc4472 @xcite , was the first x - ray emitting globular cluster identified to contain a black hole ( bh ) system , based on data from x - ray multiple mirror - newton ( xmm ) satellite @xcite .",
    "the peak x - ray luminosity of the source at discovery , l@xmath5ergs@xmath1 , is more than 10 times the eddington luminosity ( l@xmath6 ) of a neutron star .",
    "this high luminosity makes the source an ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulx ; a non - nuclear x - ray source with l@xmath7ergs@xmath1 , assuming isotropic emission ) .",
    "bf moreover , its luminosity varied by a factor of seven in just a few hours , thereby ruling out the possibility that the system is a superposition of neutron stars and confirming it as a likely bh system .",
    "@xcite carried out spectroscopic analysis of xmmu122939.7 + 075333 using _ xmm - newton _",
    "data @xcite and _ chandra _ data .",
    "they found that the spectra were well fit by a multicolour disk blackbody model and had an inner disk temperature of about _ _",
    "k__t@xmath8= 0.15kev with the same underlying continuum whether the source was in a bright or faint phase , but with varying absorption column density .",
    "the results of this spectral analysis support the idea that the x - ray variability was due to a change in absorption column density .",
    "further investigation by @xcite using four short _ chandra _ and _ swift _ observations of xmmu122939.7 + 075333 found that its luminosity appeared to be declining over a period of several years .",
    "xmmu122939.7 + 075333 has also been studied extensively at optical wavelengths .",
    "@xcite found [ oiii]@xmath95007 emission associated with the system .",
    "optical spectroscopic follow up with higher signal - to - noise by @xcite revealed both [ oiii]@xmath95007 and [ oiii]@xmath94949 emission from xmmu122939.7 + 075333 .",
    "in addition to the narrow ( few hundred kms@xmath1 ) core already found by @xcite , these emission lines were found to have very broad wings with a velocity width of about 2000kms@xmath1 and were therefore blended .",
    "the total emission line luminosity in the @xcite spectrum was found to be 1.4@xmath10ergs@xmath1 , with a flux ratio of [ oiii ] to h@xmath11 of at least 30 .",
    "a long term spectroscopic campaign was carried out by @xcite to monitor the variability and velocity structure of the [ oiii ] emission from xmmu122939.7 + 075333 . while the [ oiii ] velocity structure was relatively constant over a time span of more than 400 days , the luminosity of the emission lines declined by approximately 10% .",
    "most recently , @xcite used spatially resolved spectroscopic data from _ hst_/stis to determine the spatial structure of the [ oiii ] emission .",
    "they found that the half - light radius of the gas is between 3 and 7pc and that the light profile of the oxygen gas emission is consistent with the light profile of rz2109 s continuum .",
    "the high ratio of [ oiii ] to h@xmath11 determined by @xcite suggests that the donor star is likely to be a hydrogen deficient star such as a white dwarf ( wd ) , as first suggested by @xcite .",
    "most wds are composed almost entirely ( @xmath12 by mass ) of carbon and oxygen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus we would expect that the matter accreted from such a donor would be rich in carbon and oxygen and poor in hydrogen .",
    "this is in keeping with the findings of @xcite , who showed that the optical spectrum associated with xmmu122939.7 + 075333 is poor in hydrogen and rich in oxygen .",
    "on the basis of evolutionary arguments @xcite suggested that the system is most likely a hierarchical triple star system , with an inner stellar mass bh - wd binary . in this scenario , it is thought that the outer star in the triple plays an important role in the evolution of the inner binary through the kozai mechanism @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that we would expect @xmath13 ( and therefore the x - ray flux of the binary ) to vary significantly on the time - scale for which @xmath14 varies due to the kozai mechanism .",
    "they showed that for representative values of the system parameters , the period of @xmath14 variations is about 40 years ; we then expect the x - ray flux of the inner binary to vary on a similar timescale .",
    "@xcite studied x - ray data for xmmu122939.7 + 075333 that spanned 30 years and they show that long term variation in flux is consistent with it declining on the timescale of the period of eccentricity .",
    "thus the scenario of xmmu122939.7 + 075333 as a triple system with an inner wd - bh binary was favoured .",
    "the x - ray variability is likely to be due to a variable absorption column density caused by an accretion disk which has the same composition as the wd donor star .",
    "the [ oiii ] emission is likely to be from the disk wind , driven by moderately super - eddington accretion onto the central compact object .",
    "the disk wind is then photoionised by the x - ray emission from the central source .",
    "such a system would have several observational features and parameters that could be observed to test the veracity of this model .",
    "a wd - bh binary is expected to be compact and have a short orbital period @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to a high accretion rate , a fully ionised accretion disk and thus a persistently luminous x - ray source .",
    "the wd would have supplied the accretion disk with material rich in oxygen and carbon .",
    "it may therefore be possible to detect x - ray and/ or ultraviolet emission lines from carbon or oxygen in the source spectra .",
    "if the photoionised accretion disk wind is variable , we expect to see aperiodic modulations of the x - ray luminosity due to obscuration by a changing absorption column density @xcite .",
    "since soft x - rays ( @xmath41kev ) are absorbed preferentially , this means that the source spectrum should be softer when the source is more luminous .",
    "recent deep observations of xmmu122939 + 075333 have made it possible to probe some of these questions . in this paper",
    "we explore both the temporal and spectral properties of this source to improve our understanding of its nature .",
    "the two most recent deep observations of xmmu122939 + 075333 were obtained from the _ chandra _ telescope ( obs i d 12889 and 12888 ) .",
    "they were taken one week apart on 14 and 21 february 2011 respectively , with exposure times of 140ks and 160ks respectively .",
    "the data were first reprocessed using _",
    "calibration data from march 2011 to create new level two events files with the ciao _",
    "acis_reprocess_events _ script .",
    "the images were then checked for background flares .",
    "specextract _ to produce source and background spectra and _ dmextract _ to make light curves .    to establish whether the source is persistently bright , we look to a long term x - ray light curve spanning several years .",
    "the long term light curve of the source was produced using data from the _ chandra _ , _ xmm _ and _ rosat _ telescopes .",
    "the light curves for obs i d 12889 and 12888 are used to explore the short term variation of the x - ray flux .    to test whether varying intrinsic absorption plays a significant role in flux variation , the most recent _ _",
    "chandra__observations were split into bright and faint phases ( with the dividing line being the mean count rate of @xmath151.3@xmath16 to more accurately analyse the data .",
    "we analyse the light curves to determine whether the flux variations are between faint and bright phases is significant and , if so , whether it is related to a change in absorption column by calculating hardness ratios .    to do this , the counts in the bright and faint phases were divided into hard ( 1@xmath175kev ) and soft ( 0.5@xmath171kev ) energy bands , such that there were a roughly even number of counts in each band for the bright phase .",
    "xmmu122939 + 075333 is situated near the edge of ccd chip acis-5 in obs i d 12889 and 12888 . to calculate the source count rate accurately , we made exposure maps of the chip using _ mkexpmap _ and used them to correct for the decreased effective area near the chip gaps .",
    "the hardness ratio , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the number of counts in the hard and soft bands respectively , was then determined for the bright and soft phase of each observation .",
    "we also compute the probability that the changes in hardness ratio between faint and bright phases happened by chance , using the binomial probability distribution .    in order to compare the spectral properties of xmmu122939 + 075333 to those of other black hole binaries",
    ", we model the spectra with the standard spectral model often used for galactic bh binaries as well as ulxs ; i.e. a model consisting of a disk blackbody ( diskbb ) continuum plus a powerlaw ( pl ) component .",
    "the obs i d 12888 and 12889 spectra were both fit with this model .",
    "we also include 100ks _ xmm _ observation of the source taken in 2004 ( hereafter referred to as xmm04 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in out spectral analysis .",
    "the optical spectra of xmmu122939 + 075333 shows strong [ oiii ] emission . to establish whether oxygen emission is also present in the x - ray spectra of the source , we attempt to model the excess of soft counts as a an emission line , using a gaussian spectral model component . the obs i d 12889 and 12888 spectra and xmm04 were fit jointly with the same models so that the gaussian component could be tied to the same value across all three data sets .",
    "the data sets were fit simultaneously with the same continuum model ( either diskbb only , pl only , or diskbb plus pl ) , with the associated continuum spectral parameters ( e.g. , photon index , @xmath21 ) free to vary between each data set .",
    "the _ f _ test was carried out on the gaussian line component to determine its significance .",
    "the spectral analysis was carried out using the interactive spectral interpretation system ( isis ) version 1.6.1 .",
    "only data in the well calibrated , low background range of 0.5@xmath175kev were used .",
    "this energy range is not standard ; many other groups use an energy range up to 8 or 10kev .",
    "however , after inspecting our data , we found that our chosen energy range resulted in the best quality spectra .",
    "the gehrels statistic was used to calculate errors as it gives a more reliable fit to data with low count rates @xcite .",
    "the phabs absorption model was used to fit foreground absorption with the galactic absorption column density , @xmath22@xmath23 and default isis ( xspec ) abundances and cross sections .",
    "we do not have a sufficient number of counts in the spectra to allow for the fitting of models where both the spectral parameters and the absorption column density are free to vary .",
    "we thus keep the absorption column density frozen to the galactic foreground value .",
    "the interstellar medium of elliptical galaxies contains very little cool molecular or atomic gas ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so any absorption from ngc4472 itself would be negligible .    for the cases where the flux variation between bright and faint spectra was found to be significant , the spectra were analysed separately .",
    "the bright and faint phase spectra were grouped to a minimum signal - to - noise ratio of three and two per bin respectively .",
    "these spectra were then separately fit with pl or diskbb continuum models @xcite and a gaussian component to fit an excess of counts at @xmath150.6kev .    to further test whether the flux variation between bright and faint spectra could be due to a change in absorption column density",
    ", we also fit the faint spectra with the best fit parameters of their respective bright spectrum and allow @xmath24 to vary .",
    "the long term light curve was made up of data from the most recent deep _ chandra _ observations of xmmu122939.7 + 075333 as well as archival data from _ xmm _ , _ chandra _ , and _",
    "rosat_.    the flux from a _",
    "data set taken in 2000 was determined using isis and the spectral parameters from @xcite .",
    "the flux for the 2004 _ xmm _ observation was taken from the bright phase spectrum ( count rate @xmath25 0.04 counts / s ) of xmm04 only and calculated in isis using the spectral parameters found in @xcite .",
    "this was done to be consistent with the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the 2002 _ xmm _ and 2010 _ chandra _ @xcite fluxes and errors were calculated from their respective count rate or flux errors using the w3pimms tool , assuming a @xmath21= 1.7 power law spectral model .",
    "the _ rosat _ data @xcite had poor spectral resolution and w3pimms was used to calculate the flux from the count rate .",
    "@xcite found that the count rate for the _ rosat _ data was consistent with that of the bright xmm04 data ; they therefore used the xmm04 inner disk temperature value ( 0.2kev ) to fit the _ rosat _ data .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "luminosity is a factor of 6 higher when a 1kev blackbody temperature is assumed compared to a temperature of 0.2kev .",
    "the errors for this source are thus dominated by the uncertain energy to counts conversion for this data .",
    "@xcite estimate that the luminosity of the source at the time of the _ rosat _ observation is between 10@xmath26 and 10@xmath27 ergs@xmath1 . in this work",
    "we used a 0.2kev blackbody to estimate the flux of the _ rosat _ data .",

    "the source displays periods of brightening ( by a factor of roughly three from the mean count rate ) on the timescale of hours in the light curves from obs i d 12289 and 12888 .",
    "these source light curves were fit with a constant count rate , which was different for each light curve .",

    "a constant count rate fit to the light curve for obs i d 12889 can not be ruled out at greater than the 37% level ; we did not detect significant variability over this observation .",

    "it was found that this excess could be modelled either as a thermal plasma component with @xmath68kev or as a broad gaussian line with @xmath69kev .",
    "@xcite found that the soft excess in ngc4395 x-1 could be modelled as a thermal plasma with @xmath70kev .",
    "@xcite modelled the soft excess in ngc5408 x-1 and ngc6946 x-1 as blue - shifted , absorption lines due to the radiatively driven wind which is expected to accompany the accretion scenario in ulxs @xcite .",
    "they find that modelling the spectra in this way gives statistically poorer fits than modelling with a thermal plasma .",
    "however , they still favoured broad absorption features from a disk wind over thermal plasmas , and argued that more sophisticated modelling is needed . in our system , we argue that the features are more likely to be emission lines from the same plasma that produces the o[viii ] emission lines in the optical , but we agree that several plausible scenarios could produce the observed results , and some combination of better data and more sophisticated modelling would be required to distinguish between the various possibilities .",
    "our spectra also show hints of other features besides the excess at 0.65kev .",
    "both the obs i d 12889 and 12888 spectra show suggestive evidence for a hard ( @xmath712kev ) excess .",
    "@xcite also report a hard excess in their spectral analysis of the source . this feature may require an additional continuum component in order to fit properly .",
    "however , our data do not have enough counts to do this without increasing the degeneracy of the model significantly .",
    "there also appears to be an excess of photons at @xmath151kev in the _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ spectra .",
    "narrow spectral features have been seen at these energies for lmc x-4 @xcite .",
    "the narrow feature arises from emission from ne x ly@xmath72 ( 1.02 kev ) .",
    "however , since the standard ulx spectral model gives statistically acceptable fits to the spectra of xmmu122939.7 + 075333 , we can not say that the line plus continuum spectral modelled is preferred over the standard ulx model .",
    "we can therefore not distinguish between the scenario where the soft excess is due to highly ionised oxygen or a cool disk component , using these data sets .",
    "the result of the varying absorption model indicate that the absorption column density is significantly higher during the faint phase of obs i d 12888 than during the bright phase .",
    "this result is in accord with the findings of the flux variation analysis as well as the hr calculations .",
    "it therefore appears that over the course of obs i d 12888 , the source did undergo significant variations in flux , hr and absorption column density between the faint and bright phase .",
    "@xcite , using bright and faint phase spectra from xmm04 , also found that the faint phase could be well modelled by using the best fit spectral parameters for the bright phase and letting the absorption column density be free to vary .",
    "they found a significantly increased value of @xmath24 with this model .",
    "in this paper we have shown that xmmu122939.7 + 075333 appears to be a persistently luminous x - ray source .",
    "the short term , intra - observational flux variability is too rapid to be caused by spectral state changes and can more easily be explained by a changing absorption column density .",
    "the significant increase in luminosity over a the period of a year ( 2010 to 2011 ) is not consistent with the idea that the long term , large amplitude flux modulations displayed by xmmu122939.7 + 075333 are caused by the kozai mechanism alone .",
    "however , this does not rule out the possibility that there may be other variations in addition to the decay expected from the kozai mechanism .",
    "for instance , @xcite have shown that periodic modulation of the eccentricity of a close binary can be forced by a third body , even in the absence of the large inclination angle required for kozai resonances to develop .",
    "we also show that source has an excess of soft photons when the source is in a bright phase , which is consistent with previous analysis carried out on this system .",
    "the excess of soft x - ray photons can be modelled as emission from oviii ( 0.65kev ) from the source",
    ". however , the standard spectral model ( disk blackbody plus power law component ) also gives acceptable fits to the data .",
    "both sets of spectral models suggest that xmmu122939.7 + 075333 is indeed bh binary . at this point we do not have sufficient evidence to prefer one over the other .",
