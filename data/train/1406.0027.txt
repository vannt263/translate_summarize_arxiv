    "the discovery of the iron - based high - temperature superconductors has attracted much experimental and theoretical attention in recent years .",
    "much of the development in this field has been summarized in several review articles.@xcite the parent compound of the 122-family bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 has a collinear antiferromagnetic ( caf ) spin - density wave ( sdw ) order . by doping either electrons or holes into the parent compound superconductivity",
    "appears in close proximity to the sdw phase.@xcite in the underdoped regime , both the sdw and superconducting ( sc ) orders coexist .",
    "when the material is further doped with electrons / holes , the sdw is continuously suppressed , until there is only the sc order left in the optimal and overdoped regimes .",
    "many experiments@xcite suggest that the sc pairing symmetry in these compounds has the predicted @xmath1-wave symmetry.@xcite this pairing exhibits interband sign - reversal of the order parameter , which can be simulated by a next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) pairing interaction.@xcite    earlier studies@xcite based on the minimal two - orbital model of fe @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals proposed by raghu et al.,@xcite found that nonmagnetic impurity states are located close to the sc coherence peaks and do not form ingap states .",
    "these results contradicted another phenomenological model in which the asymmetry of the as atoms below and above the fe plane was considered.@xcite there two resonance peaks on both sides of the gap center were obtained in the spatially - resolved local density of states ( ldos ) near the impurity site of electron - doped samples.@xcite in addition , several other studies used even more realistic five - orbital models to investigate the single - impurity problem for different iron - based compounds such as lafeaso@xmath4f@xmath5@xcite , lifeas@xcite , k@xmath5fe@xmath6se@xmath0.@xcite these studies verified that details of the electronic band structure strongly influence the magnitude and location of the ingap resonant states generated by the scattering of quasiparticles off a single impurity.@xcite    very recently , we explored the evolution of the fermi surface ( fs ) as a function of electron and hole doping in the 122 pnictides@xcite and demonstrated that the two - orbital model constructed by tai et al.@xcite reproduces the experimental phase diagram of both electron and hole doped 122 pnictides .",
    "while the evolution of the fs topology can be explored and interpreted straightforwardly by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) for cases of slightly underdoped and overdoped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 compounds , where the gap on the fs is either due to the sdw order@xcite or the sc order,@xcite the analysis is much more involved in the coexistence phase and for optimal doping .",
    "this is because in the optimal and underdoped regimes of the phase diagram , where both the sdw and sc order coexist and have similar magnitude , it is rather difficult to interpret the arpes experiments and extract the sdw and sc order parameters . in addition",
    ", the fs evolution with doping also affects other spectral properties .",
    "for instance , the impurity states as a function of doping in the ldos should follow the evolution of the phase diagram,@xcite which can be investigated directly by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) and analyzed by theory .",
    "therefore the main purpose of this work is to study the effect of a single impurity like that of a zn atom on the ingap states for both electron- and hole - doped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 compounds .",
    "the zn atom is a nonmagnetic impurity which substitutes for an fe atom . from first - principles calculations",
    "it can be concluded that its potential is negative and in the strong scattering limit , because electronic structure calculations suggest that the zn-@xmath7 impurity level is considerably far below the fe-@xmath7 level by about @xmath8 ev.@xcite hence from studying the evolution of the quasiparticle states with doping , we expect to obtain a clearer understanding of the interplay between the local sdw and the sc order near the zn impurity site .",
    "in addition , we calculate and analyze the variation of the dos in uniformly doped samples ranging from the underdoped to overdoped regimes and compare our results directly with sts and indirectly with point - contact spectroscopy ( pcs ) experiments .",
    "this analysis enables us to identify the origin of the two sc gaps observed in optimal doped systems .",
    "even more revealing is the study of the quasiparticle states due to a nonmagnetic single impurity for identifying the sc pairing symmetry and the underlying sdw order in the doped 122s , similar to previous work in other unconventional superconductors.@xcite it is important to recognize the following two points in the analysis of quasiparticle states : first , the ingap bound states around a nonmagnetic single impurity can exist for typical @xmath1-wave pairing symmetry , while they do not appear in conventional @xmath9-wave superconductors .",
    "these ingap states are believed to be generated by the impurity scattering of quasiparticles from parts of the fs with positive to negative sc order parameter or vice versa .",
    "alternatively , they can also be regarded as the andreev bound states induced by the impurity .",
    "measurements of the ldos by sts may observe these midgap states and provide additional evidence for the proposed pairing scenario.@xcite second , the impurity effect on the sc transition temperature @xmath10 of fe - pnictides can provide valuable clues to the pairing symmetry.@xcite in an isotropic @xmath9-wave superconductor with intraband scattering only , nonmagnetic impurities do not cause pair - breaking and @xmath10 remains unchanged according to the anderson theorem.@xcite .",
    "however , more recent measurements of the magnetic susceptibility and resistivity@xcite of high - quality , single - crystalline ba(fe@xmath11zn@xmath12co@xmath13)@xmath14as@xmath14 compounds , suggest that the electron - doped sc is almost fully suppressed above a concentration of roughly @xmath15 zn , regardless of whether the sample is underdoped , optimal or overdoped , which confirms that the superconductivity of the fe - pnictides can not be conventional @xmath9-wave pairing",
    ". this experimental result has been successfully analyzed by chen and coworkers with a two - orbital model , assuming that the sc state has @xmath1 pairing symmetry and that zn and co atoms have strong and weak impurity scattering potentials , respectively.@xcite however , the presence of ingap states around a single impurity is still controversial in the fe - based superconductors , in particular when the sdw order coexists with the sc order .    in order to address this controversy , we start from the new minimal two - orbital model for fe - based 122 compounds@xcite and use the mean - field bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations to calculate the local magnetization , the sc order parameter , and the ldos .",
    "we present a detailed picture of the evolution of the quasiparticle states in the presence and absence of a single impurity as a function of doping in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "we first calculate the density of states as a function of doping in uniformly doped samples .",
    "our results show that some of the obtained features are in agreement with several experiments,@xcite and the origin of the two superconductivity gaps in optimal doped samples could also be identified .",
    "then we do a careful comparison of our impurity states or ingap states around the impurity with those obtained from a five - orbital model without the sdw order .",
    "we found that the features of our impurity states as a function of the scattering potential are in good agreement with the five - orbital calculation.@xcite these studies indicate that our two - orbital model@xcite should be a valid one for studying the quasiparticle states of a strong nonmagnetic impurity .",
    "the obtained ldos should indirectly reflect the evolution of fs topology as the doping varies , and could be tested by future experiments .",
