    "the dynamical systems approach @xcite has been used with great success over the last 30 years , to a gain ( qualitative ) description of the global dynamics of cosmological models .",
    "this method provides a useful tool for finding exact solutions which correspond to fixed points of the system .",
    "carloni _ et al _ @xcite have recently used this method to study the dynamics of @xmath0-theories in friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universes .",
    "clifton and barrow @xcite used the dynamical systems approach to determine the extent to which exact solutions can be considered as attractors of spatially flat universes at late times .",
    "they compared the predictions of these results with a range of observations and argued that the parameter @xmath1 in flrw may only deviate from gr by a very small amount ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the main aim of this paper @xcite is to see how the shear behaves in lrs bianchi i cosmologies in @xmath0- gravity and whether these models isotropises at early and late times . to achieve this goal we use the theory of dynamical systems @xcite to analyse the system of equations governing the evolution of this model with and without matter",
    "the cosmological equations that we require for our analysis are : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the volume expansion and @xmath5 is the shear ( @xmath6 ) .    in order to convert the above equations into a system of autonomous first order differential equations , we define the following set of expansion normalised variables ; @xmath7 whose equations are @xmath8 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & z ' = z\\left",
    "[ 2z-(1 + 3w)-3x-\\frac{2y}{n-1}+4\\sigma\\right ] , \\nonumber\\\\ & & 1-\\sigma+x - y - z=0 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where primes denote derivatives with respect to a new time variable @xmath9 .",
    "the solutions associated to the fixed points can be obtained from : @xmath10 under the condition that @xmath11 and the terms inside the brackets of , do not add up to zero , these equations may be integrated to give the following solutions @xmath12    in terms of our expansion normalised variables , the energy density is given by @xmath13 from this relation it can be seen that when @xmath14 and @xmath15 the energy density is zero .",
    "however when @xmath16 and @xmath17 the behaviour of @xmath18 does depend on the value of @xmath1 . in this case the energy density is zero when @xmath19 but is divergent when @xmath20 .",
    "when both @xmath21 and @xmath22 are equal to zero and @xmath20 , one can only determine the behaviour of @xmath18 by direct substitution into the cosmological equations .",
    "the vacuum case is characterised by @xmath14 . in this case",
    "we can obtain the fixed points of by setting @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we find one isotropic fixed point ( @xmath25 and a line of fixed points ( @xmath26 , with non - vanishing shear .",
    "the isotropic fixed point is an attractor ( stable node ) for values of the parameter @xmath1 in the ranges @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in the range",
    "@xmath30 this point is a repeller ( unstable node ) and therefore may be seen as a past attractor .",
    "however , we also have attractors for @xmath31 on @xmath32 .",
    "therefore inflation may not be needed since the shear anisotropy approaches a constant value which may be chosen as the expansion normalised shear observed today@xcite ( @xmath33 ) , provided that other observational constraints such as nucleosynthesis are satisfied .    the phase space is divided into two regions by the line @xmath34 , which represents all points for which the shear dissipate at the same rate as in gr .",
    "the region @xmath35 represents a _ fast shear dissipation _",
    "( fsd ) regime where shear dissipates faster than in gr , and the region @xmath36 , is a _",
    "slow shear dissipation _ ( ssd )",
    "regime where the shear dissipates slower than in gr ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "# 1    ( # 1 )      setting @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath37 we obtain three isotropic fixed points and a line of fixed points with non - vanishing shear .",
    "we observe the same kind of behaviour as in the vacuum case ; the phase space is however 3-dimensional , but is similarly divided into two regions , by the plane @xmath38 .",
    "the space above the plane is a ssd region and below a fsd region .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that @xmath0- gravity modifies the dynamics of the shear in lrs bianchi i cosmologies by altering the rate at which the shear dissipates .",
    "there are cases in which the shear always dissipates slower or faster than in gr , and there are ones which make the transition from first evolving faster and then slower ( and _ vice versa _ ) than in gr ."
