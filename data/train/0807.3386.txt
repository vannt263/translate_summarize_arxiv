    "recently , a remarkable new class of radio transient sources , the `` rotating radio transients''(rrats ) was discovered in a search for isolated radio bursts in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey data @xcite .",
    "a total of 11 rrats have been detected so far ; they are characterized by short radio bursts of a typical from 2 to 30 ms duration , and the average time intervals between bursts range from 3 min to 3 hrs .",
    "although the radio bursts of rrats are sporadic , the timing analysis of the bursts of 10 rrats indicates that they are likely to be rotating neutron stars with the periods ranging from 0.4 to 7 sec @xcite .",
    "rrat j1819 - 1458 is the brightest and the most prolific radio - burster of all 11 rrats . at 1.4 ghz",
    ", the source is characterized by dispersed radio bursts of average duration 3 ms with one burst detected about every 3 min ; its dispersion measure ( dm ) is 196@xmath13 pc @xmath2 ; and the peak flux of the brightest burst detected so far is 3.6 jy .",
    "the distance inferred from its dm and position using the free electron density model of @xcite is about 3.6 kpc .",
    "although the source is not detectable in standard periodicity searches , the analysis of the spacings between the bursts reveals a spin period , @xmath3 = 4.263 s , and a spin period derivative , @xmath4 = @xmath5 s s@xmath6 .",
    "rrat j1819 - 1458 has a characteristic age of 117 kyr , and a relatively high inferred magnetic field strength of @xmath7 gauss @xcite .    on the @xmath3-@xmath4 diagram ,",
    "the source is located in the same area occupied by the high magnetic field radio pulsars , which suggests a possible association between rrats and the magnetars @xcite or the x - ray dim isolated neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 observation detected the x - ray counterpart of rrat j1819 - 1458 @xcite . lately , using the @xmath9 , @xcite discovered the x - ray pulsations with the period predicted by the timing of radio bursts .",
    "the x - ray properties show that rrat j1819 - 1458 is a cooling neutron star , and unlikely to be a magnetor @xcite .    based on a study of subpulse modulation of pulsars @xcite , @xcite note that psr b0656 + 14 has very energetic and sporadic radio pulses with the same characteristic as rrats , and suggest that it could have been identified as a rrat , were it not so nearby .",
    "they point out that these energetic bursts are shown to be unlike giant pulses @xcite , giant micropulses @xcite or the pulses of normal pulsars @xcite .",
    "@xcite note rrats are not directly related to nulling pulsars which are characterized by turning on and off of the pulsations .",
    "although several models have been suggested to explain rrat phenomenon @xcite , the nature of emission of rrats is as yet unclear .",
    "we observed rrat j1819 - 1458 at 1540 mhz by using the urumqi 25 m radio telescope from 10 april 2007 to 29 march 2008 . in this paper , we present the timing result of rrat j1819 - 1458 based on these observations .",
    "the details of the observations are presented in section 2 .",
    "the process of burst detection is given in section 3 .",
    "the timing process and results are described in section 4 .",
    "a brief discussion is given in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we summarize this study .",
    "the observations of rrat j1819 - 1458 have been regularly carried out by using the urumqi 25-m radio telescope with a dual - channel cryogenic receiver that receives orthogonal linear polarizations at the central observing frequency of 1540mhz .",
    "the receiver noise temperature is less than 10 k. after mixing down to an intermediate frequency , the two polarizations are each fed into a filter bank of 128 contiguous channels , each of width 2.5 mhz .",
    "the outputs from the channels are then square - law detected , filtered and one - bit sampled at 0.5 ms interval @xcite .",
    "the data streams of all 256 channels are written to disk for subsequent off - line processing .",
    "the start time of each observation is also recorded to calculate the site arrival time of each pulse of burst .",
    "we detected the isolated dispersed bursts of rrat j1819 - 1458 with the s / n above 5-@xmath0 threshold .",
    "the minimum peak flux density of the detected signal is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the threshold signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath12 = @xmath13 is a factor accounting for losses due to 1-bit digitization , @xmath14 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are receiver , spillover and the sky noise respectively ( @xmath18 32 k ) , @xmath19 = 2 is number of polarizations summed , @xmath20=0.5 ms is the sampling interval , @xmath21 = 320 mhz is the observing bandwidth , @xmath22 57% is the efficient of the antenna at 1540 mhz and @xmath23 = 490.87m@xmath24 is the area of the antenna .",
    "we calculated a minimum detectable pulse amplitude of @xmath25 3.4 jy for our 5-@xmath0 detection threshold .    in this work ,",
    "a total of 47 observations were made within 25 observing sessions from 10 april 2007 to 29 march 2008 .",
    "the time span of each observation was 2 hrs .",
    "the sampling interval of all observations was fixed to 0.5 ms . in total ,",
    "94 hrs of observing data were collected in the one - year time span .",
    "radio waves propagating through ionized plasma in the interstellar medium experience a frequency - dependent delay due to the dispersive effects of the plasma . in order to detect short bursts from celestial sources ,",
    "this frequency - dependent delay has to be removed .",
    "the difference in arrival times , @xmath26 ( ms ) , between a pulse received at a high frequency , @xmath27 , and a lower frequency , @xmath28 , is given by    @xmath29    where dm is the dispersion measure in pc @xmath2 , and the frequency values are in ghz .",
    "this equation was used to calculate the signal delays in our 128 observing channels of each polarization .",
    "the data processing was performed in several steps in order to detect the dispersed short bursts from rrat j1819 - 1458 .",
    "the observing data were first dedispersed by delaying successive channels in time corresponding to the nominal dispersion measure dm = 196 pc @xmath2 , and then searched for all pulses above a 5-@xmath0 s / n threshold in the dedispersed time series .",
    "secondly , we checked the frequency evolution of these candidate signals .",
    "the dispersion is seen as a quadratic sweep across the observing frequency band for the strong bursts detected in this study if two polarizations summed . however , the weaker signals ( s / n @xmath30 6.5 in our case ) are not strong enough to clearly present this dispersed feature through all frequency channels .",
    "we therefore checked if they were broadband by displaying the dedispersed time series in 8 bands each of 16@xmath312.5mhz wide .",
    "thirdly , the dedispersion procedure was performed from zero dm to dm = 300 pc @xmath2 in steps of 1 pc @xmath2 in order to confirm the dispersion signature in a dm - time space .",
    "the s / n of the maximum pulse amplitude was also computed for each dm over a time series of 400 ms centered on the candidate signal . from this analysis , a diagnostic plot ( as shown in fig.1 ) was generated for each burst candidate .",
    "these plots were then subjected to a careful visual inspection to discriminate real bursts from spurious signals .",
    "1 shows the diagnostic plots of four bursts detected in this work .",
    "each diagnostic plot contains a dm versus time ( top left panel ) , a s / n versus dm ( top right panel ) and a dedispersed time series diagram ( bottom panel ) . in dm - time space ,",
    "a burst is detected as a vertical strip of pulses at multiple dms around the nominal dm .",
    "the strip is gradually broadening and finally smears out with the dm either increasing or decreasing from the nominal dm .",
    "the bursts are clearly visible in the dm versus time and the s / n versus dm diagrams with maximum s / n around dm @xmath25 196 pc @xmath2 .",
    "plots ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) in fig . 1 show a broad , a narrow and a bimodal burst respectively .",
    "some of our observing data were contaminated by radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "the frequency - dispersion property of signals may assist to distinguish between signals of celestial origin and locally generated impulsive rfi @xcite . as shown in plot ( d ) in fig .",
    "1 , the two high s / n pulses detected near the zero dm are likely to be impulsive terrestrial interference .",
    "the two rfi signals spread from zero dm ( at about 40 ms and 243 ms respectively ) to several nearby dms in the dm versus time diagram .    by using the searching method",
    "mentioned above , a total of 162 strong bursts , with the s / ns ranging from 5 to 13.3 , are detected in 94 hrs of data . among them , there are 5 bursts clearly show two - component ( bimodal ) structure with the separations of the two components ranging from 6 ms to 16.5 ms .    in order to determine the dm of this source through our data ,",
    "we produce the average s /",
    "n versus dm diagram ( as shown in fig .",
    "2 ) obtained by averaging all s / ns in each dm step of all 162 bursts . in this case",
    ", the dedispersion procedure for each burst is performed from dm=96 to dm = 296 pc @xmath2 in steps of 0.1 pc @xmath2 .",
    "2 shows that the peak of the distribution of the average s / ns is right at dm=196 pc @xmath2 .",
    "the rms of s / n fluctuation calculated from the average s / ns in the dm range from 266 to 296 pc @xmath2 is 0.032 . to determine the dm error , 3-@xmath0 level of the s / n fluctuation ( @xmath32 ) is taken . the dm error measured according to the s / n distribution is @xmath10.2 pc @xmath2 .",
    "we take twice the value as the error of the dm , and obtain the improved dm = 196.0 @xmath10.4 pc @xmath2 ( listed in table 1 ) .",
    "@xcite note that rrat j1819 - 1458 is only detectable through individual radio bursts .",
    "the timing process of the source is therefore slightly different from the standard pulsar timing process in which the times of arrival ( toas ) are determined by fitting a template profile to the observed mean pulse profiles .",
    "we measured position , frequency , @xmath33 , and frequency first derivatives , @xmath34 , using standard pulsar timing techniques on the arrival times of individual bursts of the source .",
    "the data are dedispersed ( at dm = 196 pc @xmath2 ) relative to the central observing frequency to form the pulses of the 162 bursts . in our case ,",
    "toa of a pulse of burst refers to the pulse s midpoint which is determined by the center of a gauss fit to the pulse .",
    "however , as mentioned in above section , 5 of the 162 bursts present two component structure . in case of these bimodal - structure bursts , the midpoints of stronger components are used to determine their toas .",
    "toas of the pulses at the telescope are then measured by projecting the start times of the observations to these midpoints .",
    "the uncertainties of toas are calculated by dividing the half power full widths ( @xmath35 ) of the pulses by their signal to noise ratios .",
    "toas are processed using the standard tempo 2 software package @xcite , which first converts them to solar system barycentric toas at infinite frequency using the jet propulsion laboratory solar - system ephemeris de405 @xcite , and then performs a least - square fit to determine the model parameters .",
    "the position , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are quoted for an epoch ( mjd 54400 ) near the midpoint of our data span .",
    "the timing residuals , which are the differences between the actual pulse arrival times and those calculated from the fitted model , are then obtained to investigate the phases of bursts and the source s rotational behavior .",
    "table 1 lists the best - fitting parameters and their uncertainties , including position , @xmath33 and @xmath36 at epoch mjd 54400 . uncertainties",
    "in the last digit quoted are given in parentheses .",
    "these uncertainties are taken to be twice the standard errors obtained from tempo2 .",
    "table 1 also lists the dm determined through our data , the epoch of the period , the number of toas included in the timing solution , the mjd range covered and the rms of the post fit timing residuals .",
    "we also calculated characteristic age , @xmath37 , the surface dipole magnetic field strength , @xmath38 , the rate of loss in rotational energy , @xmath39 ( using a standard neutron star moment of inertia @xmath40 ) , and the magnetic field strength at the light cylinder , @xmath41 , as listed in table 1 .",
    "these derived parameters are very close to those presented by @xcite .",
    "the timing residuals of the 162 bursts are shown in fig .",
    "3 . in this work ,",
    "the mjd range of the available toas is two times longer than for @xcite , and hence the accuracy of the timing solutions has improved correspondingly .",

    "4 compares the position obtained in this work with that of published positions .",
    "our fitted position at the reference epoch with j2000 coordinates is : right ascension = 18@xmath5319@xmath5433.@xmath558@xmath56 0@xmath55.4 and declination = -14@xmath5358@xmath5301@xmath5716 ( j2000 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the more accurate position for the x - ray counterpart ( cxou j181934.1 - 145804 ) published in @xcite and with the timing position reported in @xcite assuming 2 @xmath58 uncertainties for the values quoted in that paper .",
    "long - term observations are necessary to acquire more precise timing position of the source .",
    "as shown in fig.3 , the measured timing residuals range from - 48.57 ms to 39.71 ms .",
    "the rms residual ( 16.14 ms ) is about 0.4% of the source s period .",
    "rrat j1819 - 1458 is a relatively young neutron star which is very likely to show a significant timing irregularity .",
    "the residuals of single - pulse timing are contributed both by the timing irregularity and by the modulation of pulse phase in the radiation window .",
    "it is therefor difficult to discriminate the intrinsic rotating irregularity ( especially the timing noise ) from the phase modulation through the timing residuals of the sporadic individual bursts .",
    "however , fig.3 shows that no significant glitch , which would produce continually growing ( negative ) arrival - time residuals , is detected in the one year of rotating history of the source .",
    "5 presents a histogram of residuals and a s / n versus residual diagram . as shown in fig .",
    "3 and fig . 5",
    ", the residual distribution of these strong bursts is clearly bimodal , peaked at about -37 ms ( leading peak ) and 3 ms ( main peak ) respectively .",
    "the pulse number detected around the leading peak and the main peak are 18 and 144 respectively .",
    "the implication of the distribution of the timing residuals is discussed in following section .",
    "in order to estimate a possible contribution of stochastic timing noise to the timing residuals , we calculated the cumulative phase contributed by timing noise over time interval of our observations ( @xmath25 355 days ) .",
    "if we express the rotation frequency as a taylor series , the pulse phase at time @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the phase in cycles at time @xmath62 .",
    "the fourth term in this equation can be used to estimate the cumulative phase contributed by stochastic timing noise over time interval @xmath59 .",
    "we therefore carried out a timing solution with the second frequency derivative @xmath63 included , and detected no significant decrease of the rms residual . because @xmath64 in our case , following @xcite , we quoted an upper limit of the cumulative phase ( @xmath65 ) as @xmath66 where @xmath33 = 0.23456 is the rotating frequency , @xmath67 = 1.19@xmath4810@xmath68 is the formal uncertainty of the second frequency derivative , and @xmath69 30672000 s is the time interval over our observations .",
    "we obtained the cumulative phase , @xmath70 50 ms , in a one year time span .",
    "although the cumulative phase reaches 50 ms in a one year duration , the result of a fitting for @xmath33 and @xmath36 to a simple rotating model with the @xmath63 included shows that the rms residual is less than 2 ms .",
    "the rms of timing residuals in table 1 is much larger than that contributed by the stochastic timing noise expected for this source over one year .",
    "if we take a typical duty circle value of 3% of normal pulsars , the burst - phase span of a 4.26 sec pulsar is expected to be about 130 ms . for these reasons",
    ", we may note that the residuals in fig .",
    "3 are strongly dominated by random fluctuations in the burst phases , and can be good representations of the phases of the individual bursts in the source s radiation window .    the bimodal distribution of the residuals ( as shown in fig .",
    "5 ) can not be explained readily by timing irregularity , and may indicate the possible existence of a more sporadic burst activity in the longitudinal region preceding the main radiation region .",
    "however , the number of detected bursts is not yet sufficient to make this a firm conclusion .",
    "more observations and an accurate phase alignment are needed to obtain a reliable luminosity distribution of the radiation window .    as shown in table 1 ,",
    "rrat j1819 - 1458 is a relatively young pulsar with a long spin period and a high @xmath71 .",
    "in fact , there are only 16 pulsars in antf pulsar catalog with the measured @xmath71 values higher than that of this source .",
    "it has a modest @xmath50 and a low @xmath52 in the known pulsar population .",
    "the unusual radio emission and the detection of x - ray pulsation of rrat j1819 - 1458 make it a very interesting object .",
    "its sporadic radio activity may has similar mechanism with one of the two known radio - emission phenomena , i.e. giant - pulse emission in some pulsars @xcite or the very sporadic strong pulses detected in psr b0656 + 14 @xcite .",
    "the known giant - pulse emitters have very high values of @xmath52 ( @xmath72 gauss ) and @xmath50 ( @xmath73 ) which are suggested to be indicators of giant - pulse emissivity @xcite .",
    "therefor , the low @xmath52 and @xmath50 of rrat j1819 - 1458 is against the suggestion of giant - pulse origin of its radio bursts @xcite .",
    "the characteristic ages of psr b0656 + 14 and rrat j1819 - 1458 are similar , and the x - ray pulsation characteristics of rrat j1819 - 1458 seems to be similar with that of psr b0656 + 14 @xcite .",
    "however , we should note that the two sources have very different spin period , @xmath71 and @xmath50 .",
    "the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) have very high values of @xmath71 .",
    "therefor , the transient radio emission detected in axps xte j1810 - 197 and 1e 1547.0 - 5408 @xcite may also has a similar mechanism with the radio emission of this high-@xmath71 rrat .",
    "however , the radio emission characteristics of the two axps are quite different from that of rrat j1819 - 1458 @xcite . by studying the x - ray properties ,",
    "@xcite note that rrat j1819 - 1458 could be a transition object between the pulsar and magnetar .",
    "more studies are needed to determine the reason of the source s unusual radio behavior .",
    "a study of individual - burst properties of rrat j1819 - 1458 mainly based on the bursts presented in this paper will be reported in a subsequent paper .",
    "we have carried out timing observations of rrat j1819 - 1458 by using the urumqi 25 m radio telescope at a center frequency of 1.54 ghz .",
    "a total of 47 observtions were made in 25 sessions from 10 april 2007 to 29 march 2008 . in total 162 strong bursts , with s / n @xmath74 5 ,",
    "were detected through a careful burst - detection processing .",
    "5 bimodal bursts , with the component separations ranging from 6 ms to 16.5 ms , were noted .",

    "we have presented the improved timing position , @xmath33 and @xmath36 for rrat j1819 - 1458 based on these bursts using standard pulsar timing techniques on the arrival times of individual bursts .",
    "the location of the x - ray counterpart ( cxou j181934.1 - 145804 ) is now within 2-@xmath0 error ellipse of our timing position .",
    "no evidence of significant glitch and timing noise were found in the one year of rotating history of this source , likely due to the phase modulation of the sparse individual pulses of bursts within its radiation windows .",
    "continued monitoring is needed to investigate its rotating irregularity .",
