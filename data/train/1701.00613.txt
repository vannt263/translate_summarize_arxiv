    "quantum many - body systems in one spatial dimension ( 1d ) have strong fluctuations compared with higher - dimensional systems , and as a result , they sometimes have exotic quantum phases and nontrivial phase diagrams that can not be obtained by mean - field theories .",
    "recently , experiments on ultracold atomic systems can produce controllable and versatile strongly - correlated systems on an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "there , the strong correlations means large on - site and off - site atomic interactions @xcite , a strong artificial magnetic field @xcite , geometrical frustrations , e.g. , on triangular and honeycomb lattices @xcite , etc . in this paper ,",
    "the phase diagram of an extended bose - hubbard model ( ebhm ) on the 1d lattice is investigated by means of one of the most reliable numerical methods , i.e. , the quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) simulation with the stochastic - series expansion ( sse ) @xcite .",
    "this model is expected to have a rich phase diagram due to large fluctuations and nearest - neighbor interactions and also it is believed that it has similar properties of spin chain models , which are important models in condensed matter physics .",
    "the previous studies @xcite discussed that in the case of the strong on - site interaction , the particle number at each site is restricted to be less than two , and as a result , the three body constraint , @xmath1 , seems to appear @xcite . under this constraint",
    ", the ebhm can be mapped to a spin-1 xxz - type model by using the holstein - primakoff transformation @xcite . from this relationship between the ebhm and quantum spin model",
    ", one may expect the existence of an interesting phase , i.e. , haldane insulator ( hi ) , which is similar to the haldane phase in the quantum spin system @xcite .",
    "so far , a number of the numerical studies @xcite investigated the phase diagram of the ebhm in the canonical ensemble incorporating the constraint @xmath1 . in most of these",
    "studied , the filling fraction is fixed to unity , although some of them studied other low - filling cases also .",
    "furthermore , we expect that real experimental system may relax such a three body constraint , then the mapping of the ebhm to the spin-1 model is not necessarily applicable",
    ". therefore , the ebhm may have a richer phase diagram than the spin model .",
    "in particular , the detailed phase diagram of the ebhm in the grand - canonical ensemble has not been completely understood yet .    in this paper , we consider the grand - canonical ensemble of the ebhm and study the phase diagram by the sse - qmc simulations .",
    "in fact , the sse - qmc simulations are suitable for the calculation in the grand - canonical ensemble as large system - size calculation is possible due to less memory consumption compared to other numerical methods , e.g. , the exact diagonalization method .",
    "obtained phase diagram exhibits various phases with various filling fractions .",
    "for example , the aforementioned hi appears not only at the unit filling but also at the half filling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we introduce the ebhm and explain the sse - qmc .",
    "various quantities to identify phases are introduced . in sec.iii , results of the numerical study are presented . in the practical simulation ,",
    "the maximum number of particles at each site ( @xmath0 ) and also the value of the next - nearest - neighbor repulsion ( @xmath2 ) are fixed .",
    "phase diagrams in the [ on - site repulsion]-[chemical potential ( i.e. , average particle number ) ] are obtained .",
    "results show the dependence of the phase diagrams on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "system - size dependence of the results are also carefully examined .",
    "section iv is devoted for conclusion and discussion .",
    "we start with the ebhm defined on a 1d lattice whose hamiltonian @xmath3 is given as @xmath4 , { \\nonumber\\\\}\\hat{\\rho}_a&\\equiv & \\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}_a\\hat{\\psi}_a , \\label{bhm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are creation and annihilation operators of boson on the site @xmath7 , respectively , satisfying @xmath8=\\delta_{aa'}$ ] , etc . ,",
    "and @xmath9 is the number operator .",
    "the coefficient @xmath10 represents the hopping strength , @xmath11 is the on - site interaction , and @xmath12 is the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) replusive interaction generated by , e.g. , a dipole - dipole interaction in the gases loaded on the optical lattice @xcite . in the cold atomic gas system , the above on - site repulsion @xmath13 represents the sum of @xmath14-wave scattering interaction @xmath15 and on - site dipole - dipole interaction @xmath16 ; @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath14-wave scattering amplitude @xmath15 is highly controllable by feshbach resonance @xcite . in practtical experiment ,",
    "a ratio @xmath18 is highly controllable by using the combination of feshbach resonance and selection of spices of loaded atom @xcite .",
    "the global phase diagram of the ebhm in eq.([bhm ] ) is important and we shall clarify the low - filling phase diagram of the ebhm by means of the most reliable numerical method , i.e. , the sse - qmc @xcite . in the sse - qmc , the partition function is expanded as @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath22 is the temperature , @xmath23 is the chemical potential and @xmath24 .",
    "as we are interested in the ground - state phase diagram , we take @xmath25 large . in the evaluation of @xmath26 in eq.([zsse ] ) , the particle - number states @xmath27 , @xmath28 , are employed as a basis of quantum states .",
    "then , the hamiltonian @xmath3 is divided into the diagonal part ( the @xmath11 and @xmath2-terms ) and off - diagonal part ( the @xmath10-term ) , and eq.([zsse ] ) is re - expanded in powers of these parts .",
    "weight of each term in the expansion is determined by the mc methods .",
    "the trace in eq.([zsse ] ) can be calculated by putting intermediate states between the suzuki - trotter decomposed hamiltonians . here , monte - carlo sampling is applied for each the decomposed hamiltonian operator . in the sampling ,",
    "loop algorithm @xcite allows to create closed loops of transition states along imaginary time ( temperature ) direction .    in this work",
    ", we consider the case of low fillings , and restrict the hilbert space @xmath29 to @xmath30 in evaluating @xmath26 in eq.([zsse ] ) , where @xmath0 is the largest particle number at each site . in the practical calculation ,",
    "we first concentrate on the case @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and later on we show results in the case of higher @xmath0 . in refs.@xcite ,",
    "the ebhm was studied mostly by the dmrg . there ,",
    "the average particle number per site was fixed to unity , i.e. , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the system size , and the phase diagram in the @xmath35-@xmath36 plane was obtained . in the present study , on the other hand , we employ the grand - canonical ensemble and vary the chemical potential , i.e. , the average particle density , in obtaining the phase diagram , although we focus on the low - filling region like @xmath37 at first . as far as we know",
    ", the phase diagram of the ebhm in the grand - canonical ensemble is a new result . by studying the ebhm in the grand - canonical ensemble",
    ", we found that the model has different phase diagrams depending on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "for the case of the unit filling @xmath38 and @xmath31 , the phase diagram of the ebhm was obtained by the dmrg methods @xcite .",
    "as we explain later on , the obtained phase diagrams by the sse - qmc simulation in the present study are in good agreement with the phase diagram obtained in ref.@xcite .    in the practical calculation",
    ", we put @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( as the unit of energy ) , and @xmath41 , which corresponds to very low temperature case @xcite and employ the periodic boundary condition .",
    "we calculated the average particle density and also order parameters as varying the chemical potential @xmath23 for fixed values of @xmath11 and @xmath2 .    before going into the study on the ebhm , we investigated the phase diagram of the standard bose hubbard model _ without _ the nn repulsion , i.e. , the @xmath42 case .",
    "the results support the accuracy of our numerical code because the well - established phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model was reproduced quite accurately .     and",
    "@xmath43 in the upper ( lower ) plane",

    "the phase diagram of @xmath52 is rather complicated compared to the case of @xmath31 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath38 hi , there exists the @xmath53 hi in which the configuration @xmath54 is realized .",
    ", width=257 ]    to distinguish the phases , we measure various order parameters .",
    "the superfluid ( sf ) order parameter @xmath55 is related to the winding number of the boson world lines and defined as @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the total number of the hopping term in the positive ( negative ) direction that appears in the mc simulation .",
    "please notice that the above definition @xmath55 in eq.([sf ] ) can have a value larger than the average particle number @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "other order parameters that identify the density wave ( dw ) and hi phases are the followings , @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 is a dw correlation function to detect the dw phase .",
    "on the other hand @xmath62 is a string - order correlation function , which can identify the hi phase .",
    "( the definition of this correlation function is slightly different from that used in the previous studies in refs.@xcite , i.e. , in the definition @xmath63 , we do not fix the average density @xmath58 to unity as we employ the grand - canonical ensemble . )",
    "a finite value of lim@xmath64 shows the existence of the dw , which may be realized for large @xmath2 .",
    "finally , a finite value of lim@xmath65 and the simultaneous _ vanishing dw order _ mean that the state is a quantum superposition of two local dws with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 denotes the average particle number on even ( odd ) sublattice .",
    "this order is similar to the haldane order in the anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) spin chain , and the corresponding phase in the ebhm is called hi . on the other hand , the nonvanishing dw order always accompanies a finite string order .",

    "obtained phase diagrams are shown in fig.[qmcpd1 ] for the @xmath31 and @xmath52 cases .",
    "there are four phases ; the mott insulator ( mi ) with @xmath76 and @xmath77 , sf , dw and the hi . for the @xmath31 case",
    ", the dw has the @xmath78 configuration and the adjacent hi , which is essentially a quantum superposition of states like @xmath79 , forms in relatively large-@xmath11 region .",
    "it should be remarked that the @xmath31 ebhm is closely related to the spin-1 quantum heisenberg spin chain @xcite .",
    "the hi corresponds to the haldane phase in the spin system . on the other hand for the case @xmath52 , the dw with @xmath80 appears and the @xmath81 configuration is realized there , whereas the hi does not form .",
    "we have not found the dw with @xmath38 in the @xmath82 plane in the present grand - canonical ensemble calculation , although we searched it in the low @xmath83 region .    .",
    "simulations of the system sizes @xmath75 and @xmath84 exhibit almost the same phase boundaries for all phase transitions .",
    "this indicates that the system size @xmath75 reaches a scaling region of the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the words ",
    "crossover \" indicate that the hi - sf transitions are crossover rather than a genuine phase transition .",
    "we have also verified other cases and obtained a similar system - size dependence .",

    "we also calculated the order parameters for the system sizes @xmath85 and @xmath86 and verified that they exhibit almost the same behaviors .",
    "therefore , our practical choice of the system size in the sse simulation is expected to represent thermodynamic limit correctly . in the mi and dw phases ,",
    "the sf density is very low . on the other hand",
    ", there exists a small but finite sf in the hi .",
    "therefore , the haldane _ insulator _ may not be a suitable terminology .",
    "the string order @xmath62 exhibits curious fluctuations in the sf that might stem from the relatively large density fluctuations , and these fluctuations have small but finite spatial correlations .",
    "next we show the phase diagram for @xmath87 in fig.[qmcpd2 ]",
    ". qualitative feature of the phase diagrams are the same with the case of @xmath46 , but the the region of the hi is getting small compared to the case of @xmath46 . in the phase diagram of @xmath46 and @xmath31 , in the vicinity of the dw , a phase - separated state with the dw order and sf forms .",
    "this is a new finding .",
    "finally we show the phase diagram for @xmath69 in fig.[qmcpd3 ] . for the case of @xmath31",
    ", there exists a small hi between the mi and dw for @xmath38 .",
    "behavior of the order parameters used to obtained the phase diagram for @xmath69 and @xmath31 are shown in fig.[qmcpd2corr ] .",
    "on the other hand for @xmath52 , the phase diagram is rather complicated , i.e. , the supersolid ( ss ) forms between two dws with @xmath38 and @xmath80 . in this ss , an inhomogeneous state",
    "is realized as being reminiscent of the dws , and the average particle number is fractional @xmath88 .",
    "particles ( holes ) move rather freely on the base of the @xmath38 ( @xmath80 ) dw and as a result , the superfluidity appears .",
    "interestingly enough , the phase diagram also indicates the existence of the @xmath53 hi as the order parameters in fig.[qmcpd3corr ] show . this hi is a quantum superposition of the dws , i.e. , @xmath89 .    in addition",
    ", we examined the system - size dependence of the hi and mi phase boundaries in fig.[qmcpd1 ] , fig.[qmcpd2 ] , and fig.[qmcpd3 ] .",
    "while the stochastic green - function qmc in ref.@xcite indicates a strong size dependence of the phase boundary of the hi , the present sse - qmc does not indicate such a dependence .",
    "see fig.[qmcpd_hi ] . here , the difference may stem from the fact that while the green - function qmc is applied to the canonical - ensemble system , our sse qmc is applied to the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "moreover in the present calculation , we found that the tip of the hi phase is not clear and also the hi state connects to the sf phase continuously .",
    "there , the string order gradually vanishes without a step - wise behavior , and simultaneously the sf density starts to appear . from the above observation , we think that the ` transition ' between the hi and sf is not a genuine phase transition but a cross over .",
    "the phase diagrams in fig.[qmcpd1 ] , fig.[qmcpd2 ] and fig.[qmcpd3 ] should be compared with the results of the previous works in which the average density is fixed , i.e. , the canonical ensemble . in refs.@xcite , by means of the dmrg technique , the @xmath90 phase diagram for the @xmath38 was obtained . for the case of @xmath31 ,",
    "our results seem in good agreement with those in ref.@xcite , but the sf exists between the @xmath38 mi and hi as in fig.[qmcpd1 ] and fig.[qmcpd2 ] , whereas the sf does not exists between the mi and hi in refs.@xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of @xmath69 and @xmath52 in fig.[qmcpd2 ] is in good agreement with that obtained by dmrg in refs.@xcite for @xmath38 , that is , the phase transitions from the mi , sf , hi , and dw take place as the value of @xmath91 decreases .",
    "the other parts of the phase diagrams and the calculations of the order parameters in fig.[qmcpd1]@xmath70fig.[qmcpd3corr ] are new results .      , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "higher - filling mi and dw appear with the ss .",
    "this result shows the @xmath0-dependence of the phase diagram .",
    ", width=245 ]    in the previous subsection , we studied the case @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and obtained the phase diagrams by calculating various order parameters . in this section , we consider the system with higher @xmath0 . by a simple application of the holstein - primakoff transformation for the ebhm with the highest - particle number at each site @xmath95",
    ", the ebhm is mapped into a spin @xmath96 model .",
    "this transformation connecting two models naively implies that the hi phase appears in the case of an integer @xmath97 , i.e. , an even integer @xmath95 @xcite . strictly speaking , however ,",
    "the ebhm is not mapped to the simple heisenberg - type spin model , but to a spin-@xmath14 model with complicated interactions @xcite .",
    "thus , ground - state phase diagram conjectured by the connection to the simple spin models is not necessarily correct .",
    "moreover , the one - dimensional system has quantum strong fluctuations .",
    "thus , the truncation number of the particle in the sse , @xmath0 , may be an important ingredient to determine the ground - state phase diagram .",
    "to this end , we perform the sse - qmc with higher @xmath95 in this subsection .",
    "the obtained phase diagrams in the @xmath82 plain are shown in fig.[higher_nc ] .",
    "the mott insulators with the density @xmath38 and @xmath98 are exist in the phase diagram as in the previous low @xmath0 case .",
    "their location does not change substantially from the case of @xmath52 ( and @xmath31 ) .",
    "this result is plausible , as the density fluctuations are small in the mis .",
    "on the other hand for the dw state , ones with the higher average density appear in the @xmath99 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 cases , i.e. , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath32 , respectively . in the @xmath100 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 dws ,",
    "the state @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 realize . as seen in fig.[higher_nc",
    "] , the ss also forms between the dw and sf .",
    "however , we could not find a hi similarly to the case of @xmath52 .",
    "for higher @xmath0 , particle number at each site can fluctuate rather freely compared with the case of lower @xmath0 , and as a result , the state with particle number from unity to @xmath0 appears even in the vicinity of the dw .",
    "this may be the reason for the non - existence of the hi .",
    "the above numerical results also indicate that even though the system parameters are set around unit filling , the ebhm in the grand - canonical ensemble can not be directly connected to the spin-1 model because the hi phase does not exist . as a future work , to clarify the above problem , other numerical methods , e.g. , the dmrg , exact diagonalization should be applied to the ebhm of higher @xmath0 .",
    "in this work , we studied the phase diagrams of the ebhm with the nn repulsion by means of the sse - qmc simulations .",
    "we considered the grand - canonical ensemble of the system at low fillings and found that the model has a very rich phase diagram . in the present study ,",
    "the highest particle number at each site , @xmath0 , is a controllable parameter as well as the parameters in the hamiltonian and the filling factor . in the sse - qmc simulation ,",
    "the measurement of the order parameters clarifies phase boundaries and clearly exhibits physical properties of each phase , and the phase diagrams are very small system - size dependence .",
    "most of the results are in good agreement with the previous works , which study the ebmh in the canonical ensemble at the unit filling .",
    "besides the mi , sf and dw states , there exist the hi and ss .",
    "we also found rather strong @xmath0-dependence of the phase diagram .    in recent papers , we pointed out that the some parameter regions of the ebhm are regarded as a candidate for the quantum simulator of a gauge - higgs model on a lattice .",
    "this observation is quite important as the dynamical properties of the lattice gauge theory is a very difficult problem and the quantum simulation using ultracold atomic gases can study the time evolution of the system .",
    "it is also important to see how exotic states of the ebhm , e.g. , the hi , are understood from the gauge - theoretical point of view .",
    "therefore , let us consider a gauge - theoretical picture of the hi phase that exits in the ebhm with small particle density . as we explained in the previous works ,",
    "the density fluctuation @xmath107 plays a role of an electric field in the gauge theory , @xmath108 .",
    "finite @xmath62 means that _ the hi is a superposition of states in which nonvanishing electric fields are spontaneously generated in the spatial regions of the length @xmath109_. the nonvanishing string order parameter , @xmath110 , indicates that _ the gauss law of the pure gauge system _ ,",
    "@xmath111 , is satisfied almost strictly as a result of large @xmath2 .",
    "the higgs hopping term corresponds to the coefficient @xmath112 and is less effective than the density interactions governed by the @xmath2 and @xmath11-terms .",
    "furthermore , the effective gauge coupling is also small and the gauge system belongs to the weak coupling region , but the fluctuations of the electric field , @xmath108 are also truncated by the small particle density at each site , @xmath0 . from the above observation",
    ", one can say that the hi state is a _ new state _ of the gauge theory as the spontaneous generation of electric fields takes place there and fluctuations of the gauge field are controlled by the somewhat peculiar way .",
