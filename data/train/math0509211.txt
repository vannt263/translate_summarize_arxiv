    "markovian multiplicative_. it is entirely determined by its initial distribution , which is itself characterized as the unique solution to a finite set of polynomial equations coined as the _ traffic equations_. the result of @xcite is proved for a whole class of pairs formed by a group ( or monoid ) and a finite set of generators : the so - called _ 0-automatic pairs_. the property of being markovian multiplicative is very specific . for instance , in the related context of trees with finitely many cone types , the harmonic measure is markovian but not markovian multiplicative , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) .    in this paper , we focus on nearest - neighbor random walks ( nnrw ) on free products of finite groups , and in particular of finite cyclic groups",
    ". there may be several motivations for specifically studying such random walks .",
    "first , they are among the simplest non - commutative random walks . as such",
    ", they serve as a reference point , and numerous results have first been proved in this context before being extended .",
    "second , they may be pertinent in the physics of polymers .",
    "this is discussed and argued in @xcite .",
    "there are three types of results being proved in the paper .",
    "_ section [ se - fpmhm ] _ - we revisit the result of @xcite . consider a free product of finite groups @xmath0 , the set of generators @xmath5 being the union of the finite groups ( the _ natural _ generators ) . the pair @xmath6 is a special case of 0-automatic pair .",
    "consider a transient nnrw on @xmath6 , say @xmath7 .",
    "assume that the group elements are written in reduced form .",
    "the _ harmonic measure _ is the law of @xmath8 .",
    "first , we give a short proof of the special markovian structure of the harmonic measure .",
    "this proof is different from the one in @xcite and would not work in the more general context of 0-automatic pairs .",
    "second , we take advantage of the restricted setting to prove more precise results . in particular , we characterize the cases where the harmonic measure is stationary with respect to the translation shift .    _ section [ se - expli ] _ - the result on the harmonic measure has interesting computational consequences .",
    "indeed , in many situations , the traffic equations can be solved `` explicitly '' , in order to get a closed form formula for the drift , the entropy or the minimal harmonic functions .",
    "we illustrate this by explicitly computing the drift in the following cases : ( i ) the general nnrw on the modular group @xmath1 , ( ii ) a two parametrized families of nnrw on @xmath2 , and ( iii ) the simple ( with respect to minimal generators ) nnrw on @xmath3 , and on the hecke groups @xmath4 .",
    "_ section [ se - vershik ] _ - we investigate vershik notion of extremal generators , which is based on the link between drift , entropy , and volume for random walks on a group  @xcite .",
    "we prove the following . for a free product of finite groups ,",
    "the set of natural generators is extremal .",
    "this uses the special structure of the harmonic measure ( see section [ se - fpmhm ] ) .",
    "we also show that for the group @xmath9 , the minimal set of generators is not extremal .",
    "this is achieved by explicitly computing the drift and the entropy ( as in section [ se - expli ] ) .    in our view , the interest of the present work is to provide a large collection of tractable models , whereas very few were previously available .",
    "this is a potential source for examples or counter - examples . in particular",
    ", none of the drift computations in the paper appeared in the litterature before .",
    "for the few examples of non - elementary explicit computations previously available , see @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there exists an alternative potential method for the effective computation of the drift ( not the entropy ) which is due to sawyer and steger @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the drift is expressed as a functional of the _ first - passage generating series _ of the random walk .",
    "the simplest of our computational results can also be retrieved using this method .",
    "we detail and discuss this approach in  [ sse - other ] .",
    "the sawyer - steger method links the problem of computing the drift with the problem of computing the generating series of transition probabilities .",
    "concerning the latter problem , there exists an important litterature , especially for random walks on free groups and free products , see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
