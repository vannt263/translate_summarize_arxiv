    "the field equations of einsteins theory , being local , do not fix the global structure of spacetime .",
    "kurt gdel @xcite noted first in 1949 that general relativity admits topologically nontrivial solutions exhibiting causal paradoxes , including closed timelike curves .",
    "whatever one s attitude to these paradoxes - whether one views them simply as embarrassments , as a spur to re - examining the foundation of physics , as a challenge to philosophers of physics , or as a clue to new physical principles which might outlaw or tame the pathologies - the issues they raise are non - ignorable and have recently received a good deal of attention [ 2 - 5 ] .    in 1988 , m. morris and k. thorne @xcite conceived the idea that an advanced civilization might be able to construct a traversible wormhole which connects two distant regions of space . to prevent the throat from closing , exotic material ( with negative energy - density )",
    "needs to be packed into the hole .",
    "such a wormhole can be employed as a time - machine by setting the two mouths into high speed relative motion . v.frolov and i.novikov @xcite pointed out in 1990 that even a static wormhole functions as a time - machine if the two mouths are at different gravitational potentials , e.g. if one of the mouths is held near a neutron star .",
    "these are probably the simplest models for illustrating and testing ideas about causality - violating spacetimes .",
    "the two mouths appear as two separate masses in the asymptotically flat exterior space .",
    "spacetime can therefore not be spherically symmetric .",
    "moreover , the mouths will naturally gravitate towards each other , thus violating the assumed staticity .",
    "the nonstaticity can be made arbitarely small for sufficient large initial separation of the mouths .",
    "alternatively , it can be eliminated altogether by anchoring the mouths , e.g. by strings held at infinity .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to develop an explicit , strictly static , wormhole model of this type .    in section",
    "ii we start from the so - called bach - weyl solution which describes two static particles held in equilibrium by a strut .",
    "the strut may be replaced by strings that are attached to each of the particles and run off to infinity . in sec.iii",
    "we construct a wormhole from the bach - weyl solution by cutting out the interior of two timelike tubes each surrounding one of the particles .",
    "matching these boundaries gives rise to a layer of ( non - standard ) matter .",
    "the form of the boundaries is described by two `` deformation - functions '' which are required to make the induced metric continuous .",
    "we show that solutions for the deformation - functions exist ( appendix a ) and give their explicit form for the case that the two wormhole mouths are far apart",
    ". however , this yields only two out of the three components of the induced metric continuous . to smooth out the remaining metric component",
    "we introduce additional matter .",
    "the result is that this does not significally contribute to the stress - energy tensor as long as the mouths are sufficiently separated . in sec.iv",
    "we calculate the stress - energy tensor for the surface layer . finally , we point out that such wormholes may be used as a time - machine whenever the mass parameters of the two wormhole mouths are different .",
    "in this section we introduce the so - called bach - weyl solution which describes two static schwarzschild particles held in equilibrium by a strut between them . for this",
    "we follow the work of w. israel and k.a .",
    "khan @xcite who calculated the gravitational field of arbitrarily many collinear particles .",
    "any static axially symmetric spacetime can be written in a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath2 in the form @xmath3 depending on the two functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the vacuum einstein equations require @xmath5 to be an axisymmetric newtonian potential function of @xmath6 , treated as cylindrical coordinates on a fictitious flat background .",
    "it is known that if the schwarzschild line element of a particle with mass @xmath7 is transformed to the coordinate system @xmath8 , @xmath9 is formally the newtonian potential of a uniform rod with length @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , we may use the following picture : consider two non - overlapping rods placed along the z - axis , their centers located at @xmath11 ( i=1,2 ) .",
    "we assume that the @xmath12 rod has mass @xmath13 and define the quantities @xmath14 which measure the distance from its ends ( see fig.1 ) : @xmath15 following @xcite we introduce the notation @xmath16 with an analogous expression defining @xmath17 . as a solution of the einstein equations for our two body problem we choose @xmath9 to be the newtonian potential of these rods : @xmath18 the corresponding @xmath4 is given by the sum @xmath19 with this choice",
    "the constant of integration has been adjusted to make @xmath20 vanish at spatial infinity .",
    "thus the spacetime is asymptotically flat and satisfies the vacuum equations everywhere except on the segment of the @xmath21-axis between the the two rods . @xmath22\\ ] ] this phenomenon was interpreted by bach and weyl as a strut which holds the two bodies apart . in @xcite",
    "one of the authors has considered how a string energy density and tension can be defined for such line singularities . for our case",
    "the non - vanishing components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath23 of the line source are given by : @xmath24 the strut therefore has a negative energy density and a pressure numerically equal to it .",
    "another possibility for keeping the two particles apart which avoids a strut with negative energy density is offered by a different choice for the constant of intergration in equation ( [ nu ] ) .",
    "if e.g. we choose @xmath25 , our solution would be regular on the segment of the @xmath21-axis between the two rods .",
    "on the other hand , there are now two singularities extending from the two rods to spatial infinity .",
    "staticity requires that these `` strings '' have tension and positive energy density .",
    "we cut out the interior of the surfaces @xmath26 and @xmath27 surrounding each of the two particles - the wormhole mouths - and match the surfaces to get a non - simply connected spacetime .",
    "let us introduce two spherical polar coordinate systems @xmath28 and @xmath29 , one centered at @xmath30 the other at @xmath31 ( see fig.1 ) : @xmath32 we do not distinguish time and angle coordinates of the different coordinate patches because we want to identify points on the wormhole mouths with equal values of @xmath33 .",
    "the constants @xmath34 determine the transformation of the time coordinate of the metric ( [ metric ] ) to the charts i and ii . we will see that they can not be equal in general which is the crucial fact leading to the occurence of closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) .",
    "notice that the polar axis of the spherical coordiate system near mouth @xmath35 points to the @xmath36 - direction but the polar axis of the spherical coordinate system near mouth @xmath37 points to the @xmath38 - direction . with this choice",
    "we identify the inner poles @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the wormhole mouths ( see fig.1 ) .    in these",
    "coordinates the bach - weyl - solution becomes @xmath41 where @xmath42 is defined as the perturbation of the function @xmath4 induced by the other particle , i.e. @xmath43 now let the parametric equations of the surfaces @xmath35 and @xmath37 in our charts @xmath28 and @xmath29 be @xmath44 with three - dimensional intrinsic coordinates @xmath45 - notice that @xmath46 : @xmath47 the deformation functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 just depend on the angle @xmath50 and will be determined in the following .",
    "first we calculate the induced metric on @xmath35 and @xmath37 .",
    "the three holonomic basis vectors @xmath51 tangent to @xmath52 have components @xmath53 and their scalar products define the metric induced on @xmath52 : @xmath54 which for @xmath35 reads : @xmath55}\\sin^2{(\\vartheta ) } d\\varphi^2   -e^{2(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda_{1})}(1-\\frac{2b_{1}}{re^{\\delta}})dt^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to get the induced metric on @xmath37 one has to interchange the indexes 1 and 2 and to replace @xmath56 by @xmath57 .",
    "next , we match these surfaces by identifying points with equal values of @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath58 . to obtain a continuous four - metric the induced metric has to be the same on @xmath35 and @xmath37 .",
    "we may achieve continuity on @xmath59 for the metric coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath61 by specifying the functions @xmath49 and @xmath48 and the relation between the asymptotic time scales , @xmath62 in general , continuity for @xmath63 can not be achieved exactly .",
    "however , we will see that the error in the @xmath63 component can be made arbitrarily small by enlarging the distance @xmath64 between the wormhole mouths .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume that the mass parameters @xmath65 are positive .",
    "hence , to make sure that the surfaces @xmath52 are timelike we impose the condition @xmath66 in appendix a we show that under this condition also the radii @xmath67 and @xmath68 are greater than the schwarzschild - radii @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "to calculate the deformation functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 we equate the metric - coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 which yields a system of two equations : @xmath73 @xmath74 there are different possibilties for fixing the size of the wormhole mouths , e.g. by choosing @xmath56 at an arbitrary point on the surface @xmath35 or by choosing the constant @xmath75 . notice that if the masses @xmath76 and @xmath77 are equal , exact matching of the two wormhole mouths is possible . in this case",
    "it follows from equations ( [ deleps ] ) and ( [ g00 ] ) that @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "such a spacetime will be symmetric with respect to the plane @xmath80 and will not contain a cauchy horizon .",
    "the identification of the mouths can be chosen in such a way that either ctcs exist throughout the whole spacetime - an eternal time machine - or that there do not exist ctcs at all . under the condition ( [ appr ] ) we can show that if @xmath81 then @xmath82 in order that a solution to the system of equations ( [ deleps ] ) and ( [ g00 ] ) exists .",
    "hence , although our constructed spacetime is static , there does not exist a global timelike killing vector field . in the terminology of v.frolov and i.novikov @xcite",
    "the gravitational field is nonpotential and according to their general proof ctcs have to occur . v.frolov and i.novikov studied explicitly a spherically symmetric wormhole model with two asymptotic regions . in order to be able to compare our results with theirs we choose @xmath75 to have the value @xmath83 with this choice of the constant @xmath75 and under the assumptions ( 16 ) we are able to show that a solution @xmath56 and @xmath57 to the system ( [ deleps],[g00 ] ) exists for every @xmath50 . to calculate the deformations we eliminate @xmath84 from eqn .",
    "( [ g00 ] ) by using eqn .",
    "( [ deleps ] ) and solve for @xmath56 : @xmath85 putting this result back into eqn .",
    "( [ deleps ] ) leads to an implicit equation for @xmath48 which can not be solved exactly : @xmath86 however , if he wormhole mouths are infinitly apart i.e. @xmath87 to infinity eq.([ns ] ) reduces to @xmath88 by virtue of equations ( [ cee ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) one checks that @xmath57 = 0 is a solution .",
    "this is to be expected since deviations from spherical symmetry should tend to zero as the distance increases . in appendix",
    "a we show that for sufficiently large @xmath87 a solution to eq.([ns ] ) always exists .",
    "moreover it is shown that the solution is well approximated by newtons method starting with @xmath89 as zeroth approximation . to first order in @xmath90/@xmath87",
    "the solution is : @xmath91 an analogous result holds for the function @xmath92 with the mass - parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 interchanged .",
    "we see that the wormhole mouths are slightly deformed spheres of radius @xmath90 and therefore our spacetime may be directly compared to the wormhole spacetimes treated in @xcite .",
    "now we focus attention on the metric component @xmath63 .",
    "we have to check the behaviour of the quantities @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 under our assumption ( [ appr ] ) . using the implicit function theorem and expanding in powers of @xmath96",
    "( see appendix a ) we find @xmath97    the discontinuity of the induced metric component @xmath63 ( see eqn.([ind ] ) ) depends on the angle @xmath50 and is given by : @xmath98 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the definition of the functions @xmath99 given by ( [ sig ] ) , inserting the functions @xmath100 from equation ( [ nu ] ) and expanding this in powers of @xmath101 yields the approximation : @xmath102 thus , for given @xmath103 and @xmath104 the discontinuity can be made arbitrarily small by choosing the distance @xmath87 to be suitably large without changing the constant @xmath75 .",
    "causality violating effects will be unaffected by the distance of the wormhole mouths .",
    "the price for constructing a transversable wormhole is of course that non - classical matter must be present . in our case there is an infinitely thin shell concentrated at the surface @xmath59 .",
    "because of the discontinuity of the metric on this surface the einstein - tensor is not well defined there , and in principle we can not apply the thin shell formalism to calculate the stress - energy tensor . by a small modification of the metric - which physically means that we introduce some additional matter on one side of the shell",
    "- we circumvent this problem without strongly influencing the results obtained by following the standard shell formalism .",
    "we add a perturbation term to the component @xmath105 of the bach - weyl metric ( [ bach ] ) in chart @xmath28 which should exactly cancel the discontinuity of the induced metric on the surface @xmath59 : @xmath106 where we have introduced a profile function @xmath107 .",
    "this function should be at least twice differentiable and satisfy the properties @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "for example we may take it to be of the form : @xmath111 the stresses and the energy associated with the additional matter surrounding the shell can be analysed by calculating the einstein - tensor of the new perturbed metric . as expected , it turns out that the energy- momentum tensor is of the same order as the perturbation function , i.e @xmath112 , but also depends on the first and second derivatives of the profile function which are proportional to @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively .",
    "therefore the matter distribution has to be spread over a region thicker than @xmath101 to keep its density low .",
    "notice that in general this matter will also violate the energy conditions .",
    "the surface stress - energy tensor @xmath115 of the layer is linked to the jump @xmath116:=k_{ab}^{(ii)}-k_{ab}^{(i)}$ ] of normal extrinsic curvature across @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "@xmath117 are the extrinsic curvatures corresponding to the different imbeddings of @xmath59 in charts i and ii , each defined as @xmath118 the vector @xmath119 is the normal to the surface @xmath59 pointing from chart @xmath28 to @xmath29 and is normalized to one , @xmath120 are the three holonomic basis vectors of the surface @xmath59 defined above . for non - lightlike surfaces the following distributional equivalent of einstein s field equations",
    "holds : @xmath121                                 = k_{ab}^{(ii)}-k_{ab}^{(i)}\\ ] ] notice that the stress - energy - tensor does not depend on the sign of the normal vector @xmath119 because if it would point to the opposite direction , the two terms on the right hand side of equation ( [ ein ] ) would have to be interchanged . for the unperturbed metric ( [ bach ] ) the components of @xmath119 with respect to the different charts are : @xmath122 @xmath123",
    "as expected the calculation yields that the energy density of the wormhole mouth measured by any observer will be negative , pressures will be positive : @xmath124 if we apply the thin shell formalism to the perturbed spacetime ( [ permetric ] ) the result for the stress - energy tensor of the shell does not differ from the calculation using the original metric up to order @xmath112 .",
    "this results from the fact that the perturbation in the metric and its first derivative with respect to @xmath50 are of this order .",
    "( for the profile function ( [ sugg ] ) the first derivative with respect to the @xmath125 vanishes on @xmath59 . )",
    "v. frolov and i. novikov @xcite considered the general situation of static wormhole spacetimes where the gravitational field is non potential .",
    "they proved that the time gap for clock synchronization in the external space with respect to synchronization through the wormhole handle grows with time .",
    "the wormhole becomes a time machine as soon as this time gap is larger than the time needed for light propagation between the two mouths in the external space . in our case",
    "the creation of a time machine can be seen explicitly by studying the coordinate transformations ( [ tran ] , 9 ) .",
    "notice that these transformations are chosen in such a way that the resulting spacetime is symmetric with respect to the spacelike hypersurface @xmath126 .",
    "we see that any other slice of constant external time @xmath127 which enters mouth @xmath35 will reemerge at mouth @xmath37 at a different time @xmath128 .",
    "hence , there exists a time gap @xmath129 between the wormhole mouths which is changing linearly in @xmath127 : @xmath130 for the case that the wormhole mouths are kept in equilibrium by strings extending to infinity ( independent of the choice of the original ( 10 ) or the perturbed metric ( 27 ) ) the external time interval @xmath131 needed by a null geodesic propagating from the inner pole @xmath39 of wormhole mouth @xmath35 to the inner pole @xmath40 of mouth @xmath37 is given by : @xmath132 because this is the shortest path between the two wormhole mouths , ctcs exist if the time gap @xmath129 is larger than this time intervall @xmath131 . by symmetry with respect to the hypersurface @xmath126",
    "the constructed spacetime consists of two regions containing ctcs separated by a region without ctcs .",
    "if for example @xmath133 and therefore @xmath134 , a causality horizon will appear as soon as the null geodesic running along the @xmath135 from point @xmath39 to @xmath40 is closed .",
    "this happens at the value of exterior time @xmath136 , where @xmath136 is given by @xmath137",
    "this work was initiated at the workshop on `` mathematical relativity '' held at the erwin - schrdinger - institute for mathematical physics ( esi ) .",

    "we also acknowledge support from the fundacion federico .",
    "we prove that for large d there exists a deformation function @xmath48 which satisfies equation ( [ ns ] ) : @xmath138 notice that @xmath139 is a function of @xmath140 given by eqn .",

    "@xmath147 satisfies the following properties which tell us that for every fixed @xmath50 there exists at least one zero on the interval @xmath150 $ ] : @xmath151 @xmath152 these two inequalities can easily be verified for sufficient large @xmath87 by expanding @xmath153 in powers of @xmath96 , @xmath154\\ ] ] by estimating the remainder of the expansion we actually can show that properties ( [ prop1 ] ) and ( [ prop2 ] ) hold for at least @xmath155 .    for large @xmath87",
    "the function @xmath147 is strictly monotonically decreasing and concave with respect to @xmath140 .",
    "this can be seen by considering @xmath147 and its first and second derivative with respect to @xmath140 as a sequence of functions labeled by @xmath87 . for every fixed @xmath50",

    "we perform one iteration and estimate the error by @xmath161 the existence of such a constant @xmath162 for large @xmath87 follows from the facts that @xmath163 is bounded away from zero ( see eqn.([prop3 ] ) ) for @xmath87 tending to infinity and that the first two terms of the expansion of the function @xmath164 in powers of @xmath96 vanish . without exactly determining @xmath162 we may conclude that @xmath165 ( eqn.([eps ] ) ) gives the zero @xmath159 correctly to order @xmath96 .",
    "it is easy to see that the partial derivative @xmath166 exists and on the other hand we have shown that for sufficient large @xmath87 the partial derivative @xmath167 exists and is nonzero ( see eqn.([prop3 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , it follows from the implicit function theorem that @xmath145 is differentiable and @xmath168 is given by @xmath169 expanding this quantity in powers of @xmath96 leads to the estimate given by equation ( [ deriv ] ) .",
