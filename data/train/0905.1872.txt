    "galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) show star - to - star variations in the light elements including li , c , n , o , na , mg , and al discovered more than 30 years ago .",
    "correlations and anti - correlations among o , na , mg , and al are seen in essentially all gcs , but not in field stars , as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "these correlations are highly suggestive of proton burning of h at high temperatures @xcite",
    ". however , detection of these correlations among gc main sequence stars which have not yet evolved sufficiently for their central temperatures to become hot enough for the necessary nuclear reactions to operate by @xcite and by @xcite demonstrated definitively that these patterns are imprinted from an external source ; they can not be the result of internal nucleosynthesis followed by mixing to the surface of processed material .",
    "@xcite have shown that superposed on this is the imprint of mixing of material processed through h burning via the cn cycle , but only among the most luminous of the globular cluster giants .",
    "the scenario generally invoked to explain this is that more than one generation of stars was formed in the gc ; first one that produced the heavy elements we see today within a system where the gas was well mixed throughout the entire volume .",
    "this was followed by the second generation of stars , including low mass stars that survive to the present , then a subsequent stellar generation formed from gas contaminated by the ejecta of an earlier generation that was not uniformly mixed throughout the volume .",
    "it is generally presumed that material processed within the interiors of agb stars , mixed to the stellar surface , then ejected by stellar winds , is the culprit producing the star - to - star variations detected among gc stars , see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "recently rapidly rotating massive stars have also been invoked for this purpose as during their main sequence phase they transport material processed through h burning at high temperatures to their surfaces , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this material has an escape velocity low enough to be confined to the cluster , unlike that of the subsequent radiatively driven winds or the eventual sn , where the ejected material has such a high velocity that it is lost by the cluster .    however , some of the details of the behavior seen thus far do not match the predictions for high temperature h - burning .",
    "the most discrepant case is that of the mg isotopes . the first attempt to measure mg isotopic ratios for gc giants was by @xcite , with additional recent studies by and by @xcite .",
    "all of these authors found substantial contributions from the heavier mg isotopes , reaching up to half of the total mg , far larger than the solar ratio , which is 79:10:11 for @xmath4mg:@xmath5mg:@xmath1 mg .",
    "measurement of the mg isotopic ratios requires detection of weak contributions from the rarer heavier mg isotopes in the wings of much stronger @xmath4mgh lines , hence exquisite spectra of very high spectral resolution ( @xmath2100,000 ) and very high signal - to - noise ratio , as well as careful attention to details of the line list used for the spectral synthesis and to the analysis procedure .",
    "here we present a new attempt to measure the mg isotopic ratios in the giants of the relatively metal - rich gc m71 which we hope fulfills the criteria described above to achieve a reliable result .",
    "we exploit our exquisite spectra to derive precision abundances for several additional elements in m71 , including the light elements o , mg , na , and al .",
    "we discuss our results in the context of the history of star formation in globular clusters , and the contribution of agb stars to gcs and to the halo field .",
    "the sample consists of 9 giant stars in the globular cluster m71 , eight observed with hires ( vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) at the keck i telescope by us and one ( m71 a4 ) observed with hds at the subaru telescope by yong et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the keck observations were obtained in august 2004 , june 2005 and september 2007 .",
    "all our data was obtained after the hires upgrade ( august 2004 ) , thus taking advantage of improvements in efficiency , spectral coverage and spectral resolution .",
    "a resolving power of @xmath6 was achieved using a 0.4\"-wide slit , accepting a substantial light loss at the slit in order to achieve the necessary spectral resolution .",
    "the signal - to - noise level exceeded 100 per pixel , with 1.3 km s@xmath7/pixel . in fig .",
    "1 we compare our hires spectrum of m71 1 - 77 with the hds spectrum of m71 a4 ( yong et al . 2006 ) , which is of similar quality ( @xmath8 90 000 ) .",
    "the spectral orders were extracted using both iraf and makee .",
    "further data reductions ( doppler correction , continuum normalization , and combining spectra ) were performed with iraf .",
    "initially stellar parameters were obtained from photometry , following the precepts set out in @xcite .",
    "we are fortunate to now have @xmath9 and @xmath10 photometry from 2mass @xcite ( not available at the time of the initial m71 abundance study ) and optical photometry with more extensive coverage of the area of m71 from @xcite as updated on his on - line database available through the cadc .",
    "we adopt e(@xmath11 ) = 0.25  mag from the feb .",

    "our preliminary analysis using the photometric stellar parameters and kurucz overshooting model atmospheres ( castelli , gratton & kurucz 1997 ) revealed that m71 seems to show only very slight abundance variations ( if any ) in some elements ( e.g. mg ) , and therefore very high precision is needed to ascertain if abundance variations are present or not . seeking the highest possible precision , and given the potential presence of reddening variations across the field of m71",
    ", we decided to perform the analysis using spectroscopically determined stellar parameters .",
    "the stars have similar temperatures ( t@xmath12 = 4045 @xmath13 225 k ) , so this approach should minimize errors in the _ relative _ stellar parameters .",
    "excitation and ionization balances of fei and feii were performed with the 2002 version of moog ( sneden 1973 ) , using the fei line list of alves - brito et al .",
    "( 2009 , in preparation ) and the feii line list of hekker & melendez ( 2007 ) , which is described in melndez & barbuy ( 2009 ) .",
    "these line lists have been carefully scrutinized to avoid significant blends ( e.g. cn ) in metal - rich cool giants .",
    "all equivalent widths were measured by hand using iraf , employing the deblend option when necessary .",
    "microturbulence was obtained by flattening the trend in the iron abundance from fei lines versus reduced equivalent width .",
    "the zero - points of our spectroscopic stellar parameters have been determined by melendez et al .",

    "2006 ) .",
    "once the stellar parameters ( t@xmath12 , log @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) were set , the macroturbulence ( @xmath16 ) was determined employing five fei lines ( 605.60 , 607.85 , 609.67 , 612.02 , 615.16  nm ) and checked with other lines present in the same region ( 605 to 615  nm ) .",
    "note that in previous works on mg isotopic ratios ( e.g. mcwilliam & lambert 1988 ; yong et al .",
    "2003 ) only the nii 511.54 nm and the tii 514.55  nm were used to obtain the macroturbulent broadening . however , we find that these lines are not useful in metal - rich cool giants , because the region around each of them is badly blended .",
    "the region we have chosen to use for this purpose ( 605 - 615 nm ) is much cleaner , although we have also included in our spectrum synthesis blends by atomic , c@xmath17 , and cn lines .",
    "we recommend the use of this region to determine @xmath16 in future studies of mg isotopic ratios in relatively metal - rich very cool stars .",
    "the line lists of mgh and c@xmath17 ( 0 - 0 band ) have been previously described in @xcite , and the extension of our c@xmath17 line list to other bands is described in @xcite .",

    "we only used the best , most isolated atomic lines within the wavelength range covered by our spectra , listed in table  [ table_linelist ] .",
    "the mg isotopic ratios were determined by spectral synthesis , as described in @xcite , except that in cool metal - rich giants the mgh feature at 513.46 nm ( usually employed for mg isotopic ratios ; e.g. gay & lambert 2000 ) seems blended , so instead we use the 513.43 nm feature .",
    "two other mgh features at 513.87 and 514.02 nm ( e.g. yong et al .",
    "2003 ; melendez & cohen 2007 ) were also used for obtaining the mg isotopic ratios .",
    "after the first trials , it was clear that the @xmath4mg:@xmath5mg:@xmath1 mg ratios were no larger than terrestrial ( 79:10:11 ) , therefore we have computed synthetic spectra with isotopic ratios ranging from @xmath4mg:@xmath5mg:@xmath1 mg = 100:0:0 to 76:12:12 .",
    "the isotopic ratios were determined by @xmath19 fits , by computing @xmath19 = @xmath20(@xmath21)/@xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 represents the observed and synthetic spectrum , respectively , and @xmath25 = ( s / n)@xmath7 .",

    "as discussed below , the true error for @xmath1 mg is actually somewhat smaller than for @xmath5 mg . due to the larger isotopic separation of the @xmath1mgh lines ,",

    "4 , the c+n abundance sum is larger in cn - rich than in cn - weak m71 giants .",

    "keck low resolution spectra of cn - weak and cn - strong main sequence stars in m71 show that cn - strong dwarfs are also enhanced in nitrogen when compared to cn - weak dwarfs ( briley & cohen 2001 ) .",

    "4 ) , in agreement with other high resolution analysis of gc giants in the literature , which find c+n+o constant within 0.3 dex for ngc 6712 ( [ fe / h ] = -1.0 , yong et al . 2008 ) , m4 ( [ fe / h ] = -1.1 , smith et al .",
    "2005 ) and m13 ( [ fe / h ] = -1.5 , cohen & melndez 2005 ) .",
    "recently , yong et al . (",
    "2009 ) have found a large c+n+o spread of 0.57 dex for ngc 1851 giants ( [ fe / h ] = -1.2 ) .",
    "this spread exceeds their estimated uncertainty ( 0.14 dex ) , and is much larger than that observed in other gcs , where no significant spread is found .",
    "yong et al .",
    "( 2009 ) interpret the large spread in c+n+o as a signature of agb pollution in ngc 1851 , and they conclude that if the agb scenario is applicable to other gcs with constant c+n+o , then perhaps the masses of the agb polluting stars in ngc 1851 were lower than in other gcs .",
    "this is probably also the reason why ngc 1851 , unlike other gcs , shows a large spread in the s - process elements zr and la ( yong et al . 2009 ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the lightest and most abundant mg isotope can be formed in massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a primary isotope from h. the heavier isotopes are formed as secondary isotopes , as well as in intermediate - mass agb stars @xcite , so the isotopic ratios @xmath27mg/@xmath4 mg increase with the onset of agb stars .",
    "therefore mg isotopic ratios in halo stars can be used as a chronometer to constrain the rise of the agb in our galaxy . in our earlier paper",
    "we applied this technique to a sample of metal - poor galactic halo field dwarfs to establish that the agb did not make a significant contribution to mg in the galactic halo at least until [ fe / h ] @xmath28  dex was reached .",
    "13 shows the chemical evolution of @xmath1mg/@xmath4 mg for halo field dwarfs ( melendez & cohen 2007 ) , adding in the m71 giants , with models from @xcite for the solar neighborhood both with and without the contribution of agb stars .",
    "we see that the m71 cn - weak giants have very low mg isotopic ratios @xmath1mg / mg ( @xmath24% ) consistent with models of galactic chemical evolution with no contribution from agb stars , and extending our previous results based on metal - poor halo field dwarfs to still higher metallicity .",
    "based on the calculations of stellar yields for agb stars by @xcite , updated in @xcite , stars of initial mass 36 m@xmath29 are required to contribute significant amounts of the heavier mg isotopes .",
    "stars in this mass range reach the upper agb at an age of @xmath20.3  gyr ; see , e.g. , the padova evolutionary tracks . for a gc as metal - rich as is m71 , this timescale must reflect the minimum age difference between the cn - weak and the cn - rich stars in the gc as well as the maximum range in age of the cn - weak stars we see today in m71 , assuming uniform mixing of the gas within the gc .",
    "furthermore , the enrichment of the halo gas from which m71 eventually formed must have reached such a high fe - metallicity without a substantial contribution from proton burning of h at high temperatures .",
    "we argue that agb stars are the source of the `` polluted '' material , rather than it coming from rapidly rotating massive stars , on the basis of timescales , which would be uncomfortably short in the latter case , and also the uniformity of the heavy elements within all stars of m71 .",
    "our precision abundances define an upper limit to the range of abundances of the heavy elements in m71 ; all the m71 giants have identical [ fe / h ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , [ ti / fe ] and [ ni / fe ] to within @xmath3  dex ( 10% ) after the trends with t@xmath12 are removed ( see figs .  4 and 6 ) .",
    "this would be hard to achieve if massive stars were the source of polluting gas in gcs .",
    "on the other hand , the m71 giants with strong cn ( accompanied by lower o with higher na and al than those of the weak cn giants ) show higher mg isotopic ratios @xmath1mg / mg ( @xmath28% ) , but these are still quite low compared to previous studies by @xcite mostly in gcs of lower metallicity . in particular , star m71  a4 has been also analyzed by @xcite , who find higher isotopic ratios than ours . this must be due to the different analysis techniques , as the same observed spectrum was used .",
    "in particular , note that their macroturbulent velocity for this star is lower . as shown in fig .  13",
    ", our newly measured mg isotope ratios for the cn - rich giants in m71 lie on the predicted curve for models which include the appropriate contribution to the chemical inventory from material processed through high temperature h - burning which we believe comes from agb stars during the normal course of evolution of intermediate mass stars .",
    "fig . 6 displays [ la / fe ] vs t@xmath12  for the m71 sample of luminous giants . the 6390    la  ii line was synthesized with hyperfine structure and transition probability from @xcite .",
    "the results are more uncertain than for most of the other elements discussed here as there is only one la  ii line which was sufficiently unblended to be used , and it lies within a cn band",
    ". however , there appears to be a slight excess of la among the cn - strong m71 giants .",
    "this excess is small enough that it would not have been detected in previous analyses such as that of @xcite , whose spectra were of lower spectral resolution and snr , with consequent larger uncertainties .",
    "la , together with ba , are the archetypical elements indicating a contribution to the star s chemical inventory via @xmath30-process neutron capture . but",
    "this provides no discrimination in the source of the @xmath30-process , be it intermediate mass agb stars or young massive rotating stars .",
    "the former , especially in metal - poor agb stars , is well known as a site for such production @xcite , while very recent work by the nugrid project @xcite demonstrates that the @xmath30-process can operate efficiently in rotating young massive stars .",
    "zr is also believed to be produced primarily in agb stars via the @xmath30-process of neutron capture on fe seeds .",
    "however , we do not see any detectable difference for the mean [ zr / fe ] between the cn - rich and the cn - weak m71 giants , while differences in the isotopic ratio @xmath1mg / mg are apparent , and we believe there are differences in [ la / fe ] as well .",
    "there are four detected zr  i lines , so the lack of detectable star - to - star variation in [ zr / fe ] must be regarded as well established .",
    "the production of zr in agb stars is discussed by @xcite and more recently by @xcite . the yield of zr via the main @xmath30-process depends strongly on the size of the @xmath31c pocket , as this isotope is the source of the neutrons for this channel .",
    "the @xmath31c is itself produced locally within the agb star by proton captures on the abundant isotope @xmath32c , but the requirement of having substantial c together with protons in a region hot enough for these reactions to proceed leads to these reactions occurring under very constrained conditions , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the weak @xmath30-process , also involved in zr production , utilizes @xmath33ne as the neutron source .",
    "@xcite provides an estimate of the total yield of elements heavier than the fe - peak ( i.e. beyond the maximum atomic mass included in their reaction network ) in agb stars .",
    "their results suggest that the production of zr is biased towards lower mass agb stars than those within which the heavy isotopes of mg are made , which could explain why [ zr / fe ] does not appear to vary among the m71 giants in our sample .",
    "better models to verify the consistency of our results with the predicted behavior of zr and la vs the mg isotope ratios in agb stars as a function of mass are needed .",
    "eu serve the same role for the @xmath34-process of neutron capture which produces selected isotopes of heavy elements beyond the fe peak .",
    "no credible star - to - star variations could be detected among the luminous m71 giants in [ eu / fe ] based on the strength of the 6645    line of eu  ii .",
    "with the aid of exquisite spectral resolution and very high signal - to - noise spectra combined with a very careful analysis , we have determined mg isotopic ratios for 9 luminous giants in the metal - rich galactic globular cluster m71 .",
    "we have also used these spectra to determine precision abundances for several other elements in this gc , including the light elements o , na , mg , and al .",
    "the abundances of si , ca , ti , ni and fe do not show any star - to - star variations .",
    "the total range for the absolute fe abundance , log[@xmath35(fe ) ] , among the sample of 9 giants in m71 is only 0.08  dex . once the dependence on t@xmath12  is removed , all the m71 giants have identical [ fe / h ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , [ ti / fe ] and [ ni / fe ] to within @xmath3  dex ( 10% ) .",
    "this places a strong constraint on the uniformity of mixing in the young gc .",
    "these elements can not have been produced in anything other than the first generation of gc stars .",
    "we see the expected correlations and anticorrelations among the light elements o , na , mg , and al in the m71 giants .",
    "but the amplitude of the star - to - star variations among these elements is small , 0.3  dex for [ o / fe ] , 0.6  dex for [ na / fe ] , 0.2  dex for [ al / fe ] , and at most 0.1  dex for [ mg / fe ] .",
    "@xcite have looked for a link between chemical anomalies along the rgb and other properties of gcs .",
    "in addition to the obvious suggestion that higher amplitude star - to - star variations should be found in higher mass gcs , which with their higher binding energies may be better able to retain stellar ejecta , they suggest that the high temperature extension of the horizontal branch blue tail is longer in gcs with higher amplitude na - o anticorrelations .",
    "the latter is attributed to a spread in he , and hence may again be tied to the ability to retain ejected gas , see the discussion in @xcite .",
    "we suggest that one additional parameter is relevant , the fe - metallicity of the gc . as the stellar metallicity becomes higher , the effect of the addition of agb processed material , whose nucleosynthesis proceeds among the light elements in a manner which is somewhat independent of their initial metallicity , would be diluted , and the resulting yield , assumed to be positive , reduced .",
    "such an effect is apparent in the calculation of agb yields by @xcite , among others .",
    "this would explain why the most prominent cases of star - to - star variations within gcs are seen among the lower metallicity gcs ( i.e. m15 , m13 , etc ) even though there are a number of quite massive high - metallicity gcs such as 47  tuc for which @xcite found only modest star - to - star variations among the light elements .",
    "in this context it is interesting to note that the behavior of ch and cn bands in these relatively high metallicity gcs tends to be bimodal , while in more metal - poor gcs , stars fill the entire range of c and n abundances without being so concentrated towards the upper and lower extremes of [ c / fe ] ( see , e.g. fig .",

    "the heavy mg isotopes among the cn weak giants in our m71 sample have very low mg isotopic ratios @xmath1mg / mg ( @xmath24% ) which are consistent with models of galactic chemical evolution with no contribution from agb stars .",
    "these stars are both cn weak and have light element abundances typical of field galactic halo metal - poor stars of similar fe - metallicity ; we call them the `` normal '' stars .",
    "@xcite discuss forming the galactic halo field via dissolved gcs ; our results suggest that this must have involved the `` normal '' gc stars from clusters which dissolved early on before their intermediate - mass stars reached the agb .",

    "the behavior of the mg isotopes in the `` normal '' stars is reproduced by models of galactic chemical evolution by @xcite without any contribution from agb stars .",
    "their models with the agb contribution expected in the normal course of stellar evolution reproduce the behavior of the heavy mg isotope rich m71 giants .",
    "these stars must represent a later generation of stars formed sufficiently long after the first that the agb contribution to their chemical inventory was included .",
    "alternatively , the cn - rich and cn - weak stars may have formed at the same time , but the cn - weak stars could have been formed in an unmixed environment , while the cn - strong stars were born from material polluted by agb stars .    with the present work , we believe we have demonstrated convincingly that the difference between the generations of gc stars is consistent in detail with the contribution of agb stars . furthermore , we have extended our previous results from @xcite based on metal - poor halo field dwarfs to still higher metallicity , up to the fe - metallicity of m71 .",
    "based on the calculations of stellar yields for agb stars by @xcite , updated in @xcite , stars of initial mass 36 m@xmath29 are required to contribute significant amounts of the heavier mg isotopes .",
    "stellar evolutionary tracks establish that stars in this mass range reach the upper agb at an age of @xmath20.3  gyr .",
    "assuming uniform mixing within the gas in this gc , for a gc as metal - rich as is m71 , this timescale must reflect the minimum age difference between the cn - weak and the cn - rich stars in the gc and the maximum age range of the cn - weak stars we see today .",
    "furthermore , the enrichment of the halo gas from which m71 eventually formed must have reached such a high fe - metallicity without a substantial contribution of `` polluted '' material , whose source we argue on the basis of the tight constraints we have placed on any variation in abundance among the fe - peak elements in m71 must be agb stars .",

    "<S> the galactic halo could have been formed from the dissolution of globular clusters prior to their intermediate mass stars reaching the agb . </S>",

    "<S> all the m71 giants have identical [ fe / h ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , [ ti / fe ] and [ ni / fe ] to within @xmath3  dex ( 10% ) . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore infer that the timescale for formation of the first generation of stars we see today in this globular cluster must be sufficiently short to avoid a contribution from agb stars , i.e. less than @xmath20.3  gyr . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the mg isotopic ratios in the second m71 population , combined with their elemental abundances for the light elements , demonstrate that the difference must be the result of adding in the ejecta of intermediate mass agb stars . </S>",
