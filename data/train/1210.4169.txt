    "the point - like x - ray source 2xmmj011028.1@xmath6460421 ( henceforth , hlx-1 for simplicity ) is the strongest intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) candidate known to date @xcite .",
    "it is seen in the sky at a distance of @xmath7 from the nucleus of the s0 galaxy eso243 - 49 ( redshift @xmath8 , luminosity distance @xmath9 mpc , distance modulus @xmath10 mag ; at this distance , @xmath11 pc ) .",
    "its x - ray luminosity and spectral variability @xcite and its radio flares detected in association with the x - ray outbursts @xcite are consistent with the canonical state transitions and jet properties of an accreting bh . with a peak x - ray luminosity @xmath12 erg s@xmath13 , the bh mass required to be consistent with the eddington limit is @xmath14 .",
    "a similar value is obtained from spectral modelling of the thermal x - ray component , which is consistent with emission from an accretion disc @xcite . if these bh mass estimates are correct , hlx-1 is way too massive to have been formed from any stellar evolution process .",
    "a more likely scenario is that it is the nuclear bh ( perhaps still surrounded by its own nuclear star cluster ) of a disrupted dwarf satellite galaxy , accreted by eso243 - 49 @xcite .",
    "hlx-1 has a point - like , blue optical counterpart ( @xmath15 mag near the outburst peak ; @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of h@xmath16 emission at a redshift consistent with that of eso243 - 49 @xcite is perhaps the strongest argument for a true physical association .",
    "it is still debated whether the optical continuum emission is dominated by the outer regions of the bh accretion disc , or by a young star cluster around the bh @xcite .    in the absence of phase - resolved dynamical measurements of the bh motion",
    ", we can use the _ swift _ x - ray lightcurve properties to constrain the system parameters .",
    "the x - ray flux shows recurrent outbursts every @xmath17 d ( seen every late august in 2009 , 2010 , 2011 and 2012 ) , due either to some kind of disc instability , or to a periodic enhancement of the accretion rate .",
    "several alternative scenarios were considered and discussed by @xcite , who favoured a model in which enhanced mass transfer into a quasi - permanent accretion disc is triggered by the passage at periastron of an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star on an eccentric orbit ( @xmath18 ) . since the publication of that work , the detection of the third and fourth consecutive outbursts ( see @xcite for the first report of this year s outburst ) has clinched the interpretation of the recurrence timescale as the binary period . furthermore , additional optical photometric results have been published , based on data from the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _",
    "@xcite and from the european southern observatory ( eso ) s very large telescope ( vlt ) @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper we revisit and update @xcite s orbital models and constraints in the light of the new results .",
    "at a distance of 95 mpc , the characteristic size of the region responsible for most of the soft , thermal ( @xmath19 kev ) x - ray emission is @xmath20 a few @xmath21 cm ( inferred from fits to _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _ , _ swift _ spectra ) , and is consistent with being constant during the decline of individual outbursts , and over the three recorded outbursts @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the soft x - ray emission traces the true inner radius of the disc , bounded by the innermost stable circular orbit around the bh . instead ,",
    "much less is known about the outer disc radius , from uv / optical / ir observations ; it is still debated how much of the blue optical emission comes from an irradiated disc , and how much from a possible cluster of young stars around the bh . if the disc is the dominant uv / optical emitter , the _ hst _ and vlt studies of @xcite and @xcite , respectively , agree on an outer disc radius @xmath22 cm @xmath23 au cm , for a viewing angle @xmath24 ; the radius is smaller for a face - on view , which we consider a more likely scenario , given the narrow full - width - half - maximum of the h@xmath16 emission line ( work by hau & soria , in preparation ) .",
    "even if we adopt this slightly larger upper limit for the disc radius , the argument for a high eccentricity discussed in section 3 remains unchanged . ] .",
    "if a substantial contribution comes from unresolved young stars , we can take that value as an upper limit to the true disc size .",
    "a ratio of outer / inner disc radii @xmath25 is significantly smaller than observed in transient galactic bhs with roche - lobe - filling donors , where typical outer radii are @xmath26 cm @xmath20 a few @xmath27 times the innermost stable circular orbit @xcite .",
    "this serves as a warning that we have to disentangle what scales with bh mass and what does not , when using scaled - up galactic bh models to interpret hlx-1 .",
    "while the inner disc depends directly on the bh mass , the outer disc depends mostly on the donor star and binary separation .",
    "there is an alternative way to estimate the outer disc size , based on the x - ray outburst decline timescale .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we assume that the outbursting disc is approximately in a steady state with surface density @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the central accretion rate and @xmath30 the kinematic viscosity .",
    "when the whole disc from @xmath31 to @xmath32 is in a hot , high - viscosity state , the total mass in the disc @xmath33 where we have neglected other sources of mass loss from the disc apart from bh accretion . in eq.(2 ) , @xmath30 is interpreted as an average value of the kinematic viscosity over the whole disc ; in practice , we take the value of @xmath30 near the outer edge of the disc @xcite . integrating eq.(2 ) , we obtain the well - known exponential decline for the disc mass @xmath34 and consequently also for the accretion rate @xmath35 and the outburst luminosity @xmath36 . in summary , we expect to see a luminosity @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the value at the outburst peak , declining on a timescale @xmath39 as long as the rate at which the disc mass is depleted during the outburst decline is much larger than any ongoing transfer of mass from the donor star . for the viscosity at the outer edge of the disc",
    ", we take the usual parameterization @xmath40 @xcite , where @xmath16 is the viscosity coefficient in the hot state , @xmath41 is the sound speed and @xmath42 the vertical scaleheight . in the simplest , order - of - magnitude approximation",
    ", we can take an outer disc temperature @xmath43 k ( enough to keep it in the hot state ) , corresponding to @xmath44 cm s@xmath13 , and a vertical height @xmath45 .",
    "this gives , from eq.(6 ) : @xmath46 which we shall directly compare with the observations .",
    "if we adopt the shakura - sunyaev disc solution @xcite , with kramers opacity , we can write @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the accretion rate in units of @xmath49 g s@xmath13 , @xmath50 is the bh mass in solar units , @xmath51 , etc . then , from eq.(6 ) : @xmath52 that is @xmath53    the peak luminosity @xmath38 in eq.(2 ) can be left as a purely observational parameter , or it can itself be expressed as a function of outer disc radius , viscosity , density and bh mass , if we assume that the outburst is triggered via the dwarf - nova instability @xcite .",
    "( more precisely , if we assume that the outburst starts when the enhanced mass transfer due to periastron passage pushes the disk from the cold to the hot state . ) in that case , the surface density at any radius immediately before the start of the outburst approaches the maximum value allowed by the s - curve in the surface - temperature phase space @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the viscosity parameter in the cold disc state . taking for simplicity @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a constant @xmath58",
    ", we can then express the maximum volume density at the start of the outburst as @xmath59 , which is essentially independent of @xmath60 , given the expression for @xmath61 in eq.(11 ) .",
    "it is then easy to integrate the total disc mass at the start of the outburst : @xmath62 the disc mass at later times @xmath63 the accretion rate ( cf .",
    "eq.(4 ) ) @xmath64 and the peak luminosity @xmath65 where @xmath61 comes from eq.(11 ) .",
    "so far , we have assumed that the whole disc is in the hot state ; this is usually the case in the early part of an outburst , especially when the outer edge of the disc is kept in the hot state by x - ray irradiation .",
    "the exponential decay continues until the outer disc annuli can no longer be kept in the hot state , so that hydrogen recombines and viscosity drops . from that moment , the outer edge of the hot disc @xmath66 .",
    "the contribution to the accretion rate and to the continuum x - ray / uv / optical emission from the outer ( cold , low - viscosity ) annuli at @xmath67 becomes negligible .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that the central accretion rate in this second phase of the decline is @xmath68,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the time after which the outer disc is no longer in the hot state , and @xmath70 parameterizes the fraction of x - ray luminosity intercepted and thermalized in the outer disc . as @xmath70 can be taken as a constant , eq.(16 ) shows that the accretion rate and luminosity decline in the late part of the outburst is linear .",
    "most importantly for our current purpose , the slope of the linear decline is such that @xmath71 @xcite , where @xmath72 is the ( extrapolated ) time in which the accretion rate and luminosity go to zero .    finally , we need to consider the case when there is ongoing mass transfer @xmath73 from the donor star during the outburst . in that case ,",
    "the asymptotic value of the luminosity in the exponential decline is not zero but @xmath74 ( assuming a standard radiative efficiency @xmath75 ) .",
    "recalling that @xmath69 is the time when the lightcurve switches from an exponential to a linear decline , and defining @xmath76 , eq.(5 ) is modified as @xcite @xmath77 after the transition to a linear regime , the luminosity is @xmath78.\\ ] ] note that if @xmath79 , the first derivative of the luminosity is discontinuous at @xmath80 @xcite , because the gradient of the exponential decay is @xmath81 that is flatter than the gradient of the linear decay @xmath82 therefore , the exponential - to - linear transition is often referred to as the `` knee '' in the lightcurve of transient x - ray binaries .",
    "we shall now fit the x - ray lightcurve to obtain two independent estimates of the viscous timescale @xmath83 , from the exponential and the linear regime , and use them to constrain @xmath32 from eq.(10 ) , or , using a simpler approximation for the scale - height , from eq.(7 ) .",
    "we shall then derive an independent estimate of @xmath32 from the expression for the peak luminosity in eq.(15 ) .",
    "we studied the publicly available _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ; * ? ? ? * ) data for the 2010 outburst , because it is the same outburst for which we obtained constraints on @xmath32 from the optical continuum @xcite .",
    "we used the on - line _ swift_/xrt data product generator @xcite to extract a lightcurve in the @xmath84@xmath85  kev band .",
    "we fitted the lightcurve with an initial exponential decay , a knee and a linear decay ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the shape of the x - ray outburst lightcurve of hlx-1 is remarkably similar to those of several transient galactic x - ray binaries ( bhs and neutron stars ) , modelled by @xcite , which were successfully used to constrain the size of their accretion discs .    for the exponential part",
    ", we obtain a best - fitting timescale @xmath86 s ( @xmath87 confidence limit ) .",
    "for the linear part , we have @xmath88 s. assuming a peak luminosity @xmath12 erg s@xmath13 in the @xmath84@xmath85 kev band , and a bolometric luminosity a factor of 2 higher , implies an accretion rate @xmath89 g s@xmath13 at standard efficiency . the viscosity parameter @xmath90 , and more likely @xmath91 @xcite . from eq.(10 ) , this implies @xmath92 cm , only very weakly dependent on bh mass and accretion rate . using the approximation in eq.(7 ) , we also obtain @xmath93 cm . from the peak luminosity ( eq.(15 ) ) , for @xmath91 we obtain @xmath94 cm .",
    "we also analyzed the lightcurves for the 2009 and 2011 outbursts ( the 2012 outburst was still ongoing as this paper went to press ) .",
    "they are more noisy , less easy to interpret in terms of exponential and linear branches . however , for both of them it is possible to estimate an e - folding decline timescale , roughly corresponding to the exponential timescale determined for the 2010 outburst .",
    "the timescales are @xmath95 s and @xmath96 s for 2009 and 2011 , respectively , and the peak luminosities are approximately the same in all three outbursts .",
    "thus , we also estimate an outer radius @xmath97 cm in the 2009 and 2011 outbursts , in the standard disc approximation .",
    "those values are almost one order of magnitude smaller than what we estimated by assuming that most of the continuum emission comes from the hot disc ; and the latter was already a surprisingly small radius compared with the binary system parameters ( see section 3 ) .",
    "we note that both the _ hst _ and vlt observations @xcite were taken during the exponential part of the decline , that is when the whole disc was in a hot state .",
    "therefore , the estimates of @xmath32 from the optical / uv continuum should be comparable to those from the x - ray lightcurve .",
    "new optical observations early in the next outburst will hopefully allow us to measure the true outer disc size and luminosity .",
    "we can now compare the size of the disc estimated from optical and x - ray flux measurements ( @xmath0 cm @xmath1 cm ) with the characteristic size of the binary system . because of the sharpness of the outbursts rise and decline , reminiscent of galactic x - ray binaries , we assume that the bh is accreting from a single donor star rather than agn - like gas inflows .",
    "we also assume that the outburst recurrence timescale @xmath98 d corresponds to the binary period .",
    "then , the semimajor axis @xmath99 of the binary is @xmath100 @xcite , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "typical values for hlx-1 in the intermediate - mass bh scenario are @xmath103 and @xmath104@xmath105 . therefore , in the most accepted scenario , the semimajor axis is at least 10 , and possibly up to 100 times larger than the disc radius .",
    "this mismatch clearly suggests an eccentric orbit @xcite , in which the characteristic disc size is determined by the periastron separation @xmath106 , with eccentricity @xmath107 .",
    "the amount of mass transferred to the bh in each outburst suggests that the donor star overflows its instantaneous roche lobe every time it passes at periastron . in roche - lobe mass transfer systems , the outer edge of the accretion disc",
    "is generally identified with the largest stable non - intersecting orbit ( tidal truncation radius @xmath108 ) . for mass ratios",
    "@xmath109 , @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "if unstable orbits are also allowed , the disc may expand up to @xmath111 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "if we take the periastron distance as the instantaneous binary separation during the phase of roche - lobe overflow , this corresponds to an expected disc size @xmath112 . for an observed disc size @xmath113 cm",
    ", the tidal radius condition would require an eccentricity @xmath114 for a bh mass @xmath115 , and @xmath116 for a bh mass @xmath117 .",
    "if we take the lower bound to our observed disc size @xmath118 cm , we need @xmath119 or @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "we can argue that the tidal truncation constraint is not relevant to the case of hlx-1 , where mass transfer may occur impulsively near periastron , and the timescale for the disc to expand to its tidal truncation radius is similar to the timescale for the disc matter to be accreted and for the binary orbit to expand after periastron . in other words , in hlx-1 the disc may look small because it did not have time to grow to its tidal truncation radius .",
    "instead , the circularization radius provides a stronger lower limit to the predicted disc size , and is applicable to any system where mass transfer occurs through the lagrangian point l@xmath121 .",
    "the circularization radius @xmath122 is defined via the conservation of angular momentum equation @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the orbital velocity of the accretion stream around the bh , @xmath125 the distance between the bh and the lagrangian point l@xmath121 , and @xmath126 the angular velocity of the donor star at periastron . here",
    ", we must be careful not to use the well - known fitting formula for @xmath127 @xcite because it applies only for @xmath128 and for circular orbits .",
    "instead , we need to compute @xmath129 from eq.(a13 ) of @xcite , valid for eccentric orbits : @xmath130 here , @xmath131 is the ratio of the rotational angular velocity of the donor star to its orbital angular velocity , at periastron .",
    "it parameterizes the degree of tidal locking ; a star with @xmath132 is rotating synchronously with the orbit , at periastron . a list of @xmath129 solutions for characteristic values of @xmath133 and @xmath134 is given in table 1 .",
    "the orbital velocity of the accretion stream around the bh @xmath135 and the orbital angular velocity at periastron @xmath136^{1/2}.\\ ] ] for the sake of our numerical estimate , we take @xmath137 , a typical value in the range of parameters thought to be relevant for hlx-1 ( table 1 ) . then , substituting into eq.(23 ) , we have : @xmath138 assuming that the bh mass is in the range @xmath25@xmath139 , eq.(27 ) gives us a strong constraint on @xmath134 , by imposing that the circularization radius is smaller than the observed outer disc size . for example , assuming @xmath140 , a circularization radius @xmath141 cm ( at the upper end of our disc size estimates ) requires @xmath142 ; for @xmath143 cm ( at the lower end of our disc size estimates ) , @xmath144 .",
    "the corresponding periastron distances , the periastrion distance between the two stars is always smaller than the circularization radius around the accreting primary .",
    "this is because the angular momentum of the secondary at periastron , and of the matter transiting through the l@xmath121 point , is larger than the angular momentum of a circular orbit with the same binary separation .",
    "it is not a problem , because by the time the accretion stream has completed a full orbit around the bh and formed a ring , the secondary has moved away from periastron and the primary s roche lobe has widened . ]",
    "@xmath145 cm for @xmath146 , and @xmath147 cm for @xmath148 .",

    "the secondary gets squeezed to a radius @xmath168@xmath169 .",
    "since we have assumed that the secondary fills the roche lobe and dumps mass into the bh only near periastron , this radius must also be similar to the size of the donor star .",
    "for example , if @xmath170 and @xmath171 , the donor star must have a radius @xmath172 , consistent with main sequence and subgiant stars .",
    "the values of @xmath134 estimated here from disc size arguments are much more extreme than what was suggested in @xcite .",
    "they may seem implausible , knowing that tidal forces tend to circularize orbits in x - ray binaries .",
    "however , @xcite showed that in the case of a donor star that transfers mass impulsively only at periastron , with @xmath173 , the secular evolution of the orbit leads to an increase of both eccentricity and semimajor axis , even when the opposite effect of tidal forces is taken into account .",
    "if tidal circularization is neglected , the eccentricity increases as @xmath174 and the semimajor axis ( and hence the binary period ) as @xmath175 it is then easy to show from eq.(28,29 ) that the periastron distance @xmath176 , and therefore also the size of the secondary s roche lobe at periastron , remains unchanged .    finally , we need to assess what donor stars can survive on such eccentric orbits with small periastron distance , avoiding tidal disruption .",
    "the condition for survival is that the periastron distance @xmath177 is larger than the tidal disruption radius @xcite @xmath178 by substituting @xmath179 into eq.(31 ) , we can re - cast the tidal survival condition as @xmath180 easily satisfied in the likely mass range of hlx-1 .",
    "we compared the estimates of the disc size from the optical continuum flux ( @xmath181 cm ) with those obtained by fitting the x - ray luminosity decline after an outburst .",
    "we found that , at least for the 2010 outburst , the decline displays the standard sequence of exponential phase , knee , linear phase often seen in galactic x - ray binaries ; this strengthens the interpretation that the thermal x - ray emission in hlx-1 comes from a disc , and the decline timescale corresponds to its viscous timescale .",
    "for all three outbursts observed to - date , the timescale is very short , @xmath182@xmath183 weeks .",
    "this is similar or only slightly longer than what is typically observed in galactic x - ray transients , despite that fact that both the orbital period and the bh mass ( and , hence , the semimajor axis ) of hlx-1 are @xmath184 times larger .",
    "the outer disc radius estimated from the viscous timescale is @xmath93 cm , if the viscosity parameter is similar to the values usually estimated for galactic bh transients in a high state .",
    "we can not rule out that the fast accretion of the disc matter in hlx-1 may be partly due to an effective viscosity @xmath185 , higher than in the shakura - sunyaev prescription .",
    "but we argue that even if we assume the upper disc size estimate @xmath186 cm , a highly eccentric orbit is required to explain the small disc size .    to quantify the eccentricity , we calculated the characteristic length - scales of the binary system , as a function of bh mass and eccentricity . if the disc extends at least as far as the circularization radius ( as is usually the case in x - ray binaries with roche - lobe mass transfer )",
    ", we obtain that @xmath187 , and therefore @xmath4 for a bh mass @xmath188 .",
    "we argued that x - ray binaries with such extreme values of @xmath134 are the most likely evolutionary endpoint of systems with @xmath189 and a moderately eccentric initial orbit , such that roche - lobe - overflow mass transfer occurs only impulsively near periastron .",
    "secular evolution will tend to make the orbit more and more eccentric , by increasing the semimajor axis and the binary period , at constant periastron distance .",
    "the small periastron distance required to explain the hlx-1 observations sets an upper limit to the current radius of the donor star @xmath190 a few @xmath191 , ruling out supergiants , red giants and agb stars .",
    "possible donors are main sequence ( b type or later ) or subgiants .",
    "the compactness of the donor star , and the fact that secular orbital evolution due to mass transfer will not change the periastron distance , imply that the companion star in hlx-1 is not at immediate risk of tidal disruption , and will not be in the near future .",
    "in other words , we are not observing hlx-1 in a peculiar moment of its evolution , immediately prior to tidal break - up of the donor star .",
    "hlx-1 appears to be a stable system , with a lifetime for x - ray outbursts determined primarily by the mass transfer timescale from the donor ; at a rate @xmath192 yr@xmath13 ( averaged over the binary period ) , it may last for another @xmath193@xmath194 yr , during which its semimajor axis and binary period ( and hence , interval between outbursts ) will continue to increase .",
    "eccentricities @xmath195 may seem implausibly extreme , but there is at least one class of stellar objects where they are the norm : s stars observed on highly eccentric orbits within 0.01 pc of the galactic nuclear bh @xcite .",
    "a possible scenario for the origin of galactic s stars is the tidal disruption of a stellar binary system near the bh , which produces an escaping , hyper - velocity star , and a more tightly bound star on a very eccentric orbit , theoretically as high as @xmath196 @xcite .",
    "observationally , the most eccentric , bound s star for which orbital parameters have been reliably determined has @xmath197 @xcite .",
    "we speculate that intermediate - mass bhs in star clusters may also capture stellar companions on very eccentric orbits through a similar process .",
