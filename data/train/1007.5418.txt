    "the purpose of this talk is very briefly to introduce a quantum field theoretic model of dirac - like tachyons ( or _ dirachyons _ ) , which must necessarily incorporate spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking ( lsb ) , and to derive best fit curves for beta decay , which experimentalists may use to test the _",
    "tachyonic neutrino hypothesis_.@xcite the metric signature is @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the proper , orthochronous lorentz group is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "an element @xmath3 is simply called a lorentz transformation here , or lt for short .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] depicts the energy - momenta of ( anti-)particles allowed in this model , in a typical inertial frame @xmath4 .",
    "the spectrum is the upper half of the one - sheeted mass hyperboloid @xmath5 , sliced in two by the hyperplane @xmath6 . in the _ preferred tachyon frame",
    "_ @xmath7 , an observer views this hyperplane as @xmath8 .",
    "always uses primed coordinates . ] here , @xmath9 s velocity relative to @xmath4 has been chosen to be @xmath10 in @xmath4 .",
    "thus we have a _ frame - dependent interpretation rule_. this is akin to the ` reinterpretation principle,'@xcite by which a negative energy tachyon travelling backward in time , is ( classically ) equivalent to a positive energy ( anti- ) tachyon moving forward in time , with opposite momentum , etc .",
    "however , in the qft , instead of insisting that all tachyons have positive energies in all frames , one henceforth requires this in @xmath9 ( mod so(3 ) ) , and allows negative energies in all other frames , consistent with the action of @xmath2 , without further reinterpretation , i.e. , the corresponding positive energies with opposite momenta are missing from the spectrum .",
    "one seeks to quantize the equation , originally due to tanaka@xcite , @xmath11 which is derivable from the hermitian lagrangian density @xmath12 . in @xmath4 ,",
    "an _ indefinite _ inner product is defined for solutions @xmath13 of eq .",
    "[ dchn ] : @xmath14 here , a @xmath3 is chosen so that @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are found so that @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the @xmath19 representation of @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath20 is invariant under _ observer _ lts . adhering to the above interpretation rule , the ansatz for @xmath21 in @xmath4 is @xmath22\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the invariant measure on the mass hyperboloid .",
    "also , @xmath24 [ @xmath25 are ` upper ' [ ` lower ' ] energy solutions of eq .",
    "( [ dchn ] ) of the form @xmath26 , [ @xmath27 , for @xmath28 , obtained from suitably normalized positive [ negative ] energy solutions of @xmath29 , [ @xmath30 in @xmath9 via @xmath31 .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 denotes helicity eigenstates . the creation / annihilation operators @xmath33 satisfy the anticommutation relations @xmath34 and",
    "all other anticommutators vanish . here",
    ", @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and the sign is negative for the negative normed modes .",
    "since the anticommutators are positive definite , one must eliminate such modes from the field operator , yielding @xmath37\\;.\\]]the vacuum state @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 , for all @xmath28 .",
    "the subscript is included since this vacuum is not @xmath2 invariant .",
    "the @xmath40-point functions ( expectation values of products of field operators which in turn define a qft@xcite ) , and green s functions may then be computed in @xmath4 . with the appropriate sign in front of the classical hamiltonian density , the second quantized hamiltonian ( defined analogously to eq .",
    "( [ ip ] ) ) becomes @xmath41 which is positive semidefinite only in @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , there remains a consistent notion of lepton number , namely the quantization of the inner product , eq .",
    "( [ ip ] ) , @xmath42",
    "the usual difficulties ascribed to tachyons are instability ( of the vacuum ) and acausality .",
    "there are two possible kinds of instability : ( 1 ) due to exponentially growing / decaying modes in time , and ( 2 ) due to negative real energies unbounded from below , leading to lack of perturbative renormalizability .",
    "instabilities of type ( 1 ) are excluded from this model by fiat , since they would correspond to unphysical imaginary energies .",
    "an instability of type ( 2 ) is avoided due to the spectral cutoff .",
    "note that requiring the usual lorentz covariance of the two point function would lead to a _ non - hadamard _ state having an ill - defined stress - energy tensor , while utilizing the cutoff is conjectured to permit renormalizibility when the free model is incorporated into an interacting theory.@xcite the cutoff also prevents the creation of causality - violating devices , such as ` anti - telephones.'@xcite furthermore , the usual connection of spin and statistics is maintained in this model .",
    "this differs from feinberg,@xcite who evidently ruled out commutation relations for the scalar case due to a sign problem that can be traced back to the use of an inappropriate surface of integration with which to evaluate inner products . in the present case ,",
    "one desires a regular massless model with broken parity in the limit as @xmath43 , which would require the usual spin - statistics connection to hold for this tachyonic model .",
    "to evaluate the rate for neutron beta decay ( @xmath44 ) , one replaces the feynman diagram vertex factor @xmath45 by @xmath46 , since parity breaking is already accounted for in the free model . with neutron , antineutrino ,",
