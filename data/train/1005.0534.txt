    "hard convex particles have been used as models for simple atomic liquids and solids as a means to connect the particle shape and excluded volume to the entropy and to the equilibrium phase diagram of a system .",
    "the hard - sphere model has a rich history and continues to provide deep insights into fundamental physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "however , nonspherical hard particles exhibit more complex phase behavior than hard spheres , since the possibility of anisotropic phases arises , including smectic , nematic , columnar , and cubatic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "the cubatic phase has garnered recent attention because , unlike other liquid - crystalline phases , it is characterized by ordering in three mutually perpendicular directions while the particles retain translational mobility @xcite . such unusual ordering",
    "may lead to novel optical , rheological , or transport properties .",
    "the cubatic phase has been discovered in several hard - particle systems .",
    "cut hard spheres of certain aspect ratios form small stacks that align perpendicularly to neighboring stacks @xcite .",
    "the onsager cross , a particle consisting of three thin rods aligned along orthogonal axes and intersecting at their midpoints @xcite and tetrapods , hard bodies formed by four rods connected at tetrahedral angles @xcite , are examples of nonconvex particles that exhibit cubatic ordering .",
    "the cubatic phase also arises in systems of perfect tetragonal parallelepipeds @xcite as well systems of cuboids , nonconvex particles consisting of an array of tangent hard spheres that approximate tetragonal parallelepipeds @xcite .",
    "perfect tetragonal parallelepipeds have sharp corners and flat faces while the cuboid is `` bumpy '' to approximate friction",
    ". monte carlo simulation studies of these particles revealed a cubatic phase , or parquet phase for aspects ratio other than 1:1:1 , that arises between the liquid and crystal phases @xcite .    in this paper , we use molecular dynamics ( md ) to investigate the equilibrium phase behavior and the onset of cubatic ordering in systems of cube - like superballs .",
    "a superball is a centrally symmetric particle defined by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are cartesian coordinates and @xmath3 is the deformation parameter @xcite .",
    "superballs can take on concave shapes ranging from a cross ( @xmath12 ) to the convex octahedron ( @xmath13 ) to a sphere ( @xmath4 ) and finally to a cube ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we focus on the `` cube - like '' range @xmath14 to examine the interpolation from spheres to cubes and reveal the role of particle shape and curvature on cubatic ordering . as @xmath3 is increased from unity",

    "superballs are well - suited to study the effect of the curvature of edges and corners .",
    "although experimentalists have the ability to control shape and symmetry of colloidal particles , controlling the curvature may be a larger challenge . scanning electron micrographs of nanoparticles",
    "reveal that edges and corners are not necessarily sharp like perfect hard polyhedra @xcite .",
    "therefore , understanding the effects of curvature of hard particles on the phase diagram is not only of fundamental interest , but also of practical importance .",
    "in this study , we detail the phase diagram of hard superball systems as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath22 using molecular dynamics .",
    "to characterize the equilibrium phase behavior , it is useful to start a system in an equilibrium state and allow the particles to grow or contract ( or equivalently , allow the simulation cell to shrink or expand ) .",
    "the ideal gas is a suitable initial condition to study low - density phases .",
    "fast growth rates applied to liquids of hard superballs generate nonequilibirum , randomly jammed packings with novel characteristics @xcite .",
    "however , slow growth rates can also result in nonequilibrium glasses and defective crystals and can limit access to complex , high - density equilibrium phases .",
    "the densest - packing arrangement is a suitable initial condition for high - density phases since this arrangement minimizes free energy for a hard - particle system .",

    "we examine the liquid equation of state ( eos ) , structure of the liquid phase , and the virial expansion . for ordered , high - density phases of superballs , we examine the crystal branch eos and use suitable order parameters and correlation functions to characterize the entropy - driven phase transitions and cubatic ordering .",
    "we find that    * excluded volume effects are dominated by edges and corners ( sec.[sec : liquid ] ) , * there exists a phase transition along the ordered , high - density branch of the eos that is associated with changes in long - ranged orientational order ( sec .  [",

    "[ sec : appendix ] , we discuss the role of system geometry on the isotropy of the internal stresses , particularly how fixed boundaries can induce apparent , misleading phase transitions .",
    "simulation studies of the phase behavior of nonspherical particles typically use monte carlo simulation methods , primarily due to the simplicity of implementation .",
    "one drawback of monte carlo methods is the difficulty in achieving collective motion among the particles , which is often an important characteristic in systems of anisotropic phases . to generate the pressure equations of state for cube - like superballs",
    ", we use the donev - torquato - stillinger ( dts ) molecular dynamics algorithm @xcite .",
    "the dts algorithm generalizes the lubachevsky - stillinger sphere - packing algorithm @xcite to nonspherical , convex particles including superballs and ellipsoids . in this algorithm ,",
    "particles are allowed to grow at a specified nondimensional rate @xmath23 ( or contract for @xmath24 ) , or equivalently , the system is compressed ( or expanded ) .",
    "contact between particles is predicted using generalized overlap potentials .",
    "the algorithm allows for shape deformation of the boundary using an approach similar to parrinello - rahman md @xcite . in parrinello - rahman md ,",
    "the `` coordinates '' of the simulation cell are continuously driven by the internal stresses of system which are directly related to particle interactions . however , in an event - driven simulation of hard particles , particles only interact upon contact and can not directly interact with the cell . in this paper ,",
    "a parrinello - rahman - like algorithm is employed where the `` velocities '' of the lattice vectors are updated after a certain number of collisions based upon the anisotropy of stress tensor @xcite .",
    "the mass assigned to the cell is equal to that of the total mass of the particles .    in the work presented here",
    ", we have verified that the pressure tensor remains isotropic on average when employing the deforming box algorithm .",
    "although this algorithm may not rigorously sample an isostress or constant - pressure ensemble , it is a reasonable approximation .",
    "we note that simulations using fixed boundaries exhibited pressure tensors that were anisotropic and gave rise to nonequilibrium phase behavior as detailed in the appendix .",
    "we limit our study to @xmath25 since the algorithm is numerically unstable for @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were employed .",
    "the reduced pressure is defined as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the system s pressure , @xmath16 is the number density , and @xmath29 is the usual energy scale for hard - particle systems .",
    "particles are of unit `` diameter , '' the surface - to - surface distance of a chord along one principal axis ( _ i.e. _ the shortest chord ) .    to obtain the liquid eos ,",
    "particles were placed randomly in a low - density configuration inside a cubic box .",
    "they were given random linear and angular velocities and allowed to grow at a specified rate @xmath23 until the system reached a defined pressure .",
    "for the crystal branch , particles were initialized in a slightly expanded form of the densest lattice configuration , with the number of particles @xmath30 chosen to be commensurate with the lattice , assigned random linear and angular velocities , and simulated using a contraction rate @xmath31 .",
    "the densest - known packings of cube - like superballs occur in one of two families of bravais lattices , denoted as @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the densest packings of superballs are achieved with the @xmath32 lattice , a perturbation of the fcc lattice . for superballs with @xmath35 , the @xmath33 lattice",
    ", a deformation of the simple cubic lattice , represents the densest arrangement .",
    "since the md algorithm is slow at high densities due to the high frequency of particle collisions , the initial crystal configurations were unsaturated , typically near 80% of the maximum possible packing fraction .",
    "growth rates in the range @xmath36 were utilized .",
    "the simulation data for spheres was compared to widely - accepted data and we find that equilibrium was well approximated with @xmath37 . obtaining a full sweep of the density at @xmath38 required over two weeks of computation time with 1000 particles , and therefore significantly slower growth rates over the entire density range were not practical .",
    "we more closely examined parts of the phase diagram in which phase transitions were evident by running the algorithm with slower rates using near - equilibrium configurations as the initial conditions . in some cases , we averaged over constant - density ( @xmath39 ) md trajectories consisting of nearly @xmath40 collisions per particle .",
    "we find that the phase transitions in the @xmath41 cases are slightly sharper than those in cases using slow growth or contraction rates but generally occur at the same densities .",
    "growth rates of @xmath42 usually produced jammed , metastable structures .",
    "these are explored in separate studies @xcite . for each @xmath3",
    ", we obtained multiple , independent sweeps of the density for both the liquid and solid branches to examine the variability of the results .",
    "the results presented in this paper were obtained using 1000 particles .",
    "we have varied the system size between @xmath43 to 1728 .",
    "it is important to point out that no simulation method can effectively determine rare events .",
    "even detailed free - energy calculations may encounter the inability to find states associated with rare events .",
    "unfortunately , hard - particle md requires serial calculations and advances in the parallelization of these algorithms are required to produce longer trajectories .",
    "until then , these algorithms are the most efficient use of computer resources and can complement monte carlo methods that lack the ability to capture dynamics of collective motion .",
