    "the study of non - equilibrium superconductivity in conventional @xmath1-wave superconductors has a long history .",
    "several comprehensive reviews exist.@xcite much less has been done for unconventional order parameters including the high @xmath4 oxides .",
    "the cuprates are particularly interesting since there is now a consensus that its energy gap has @xmath0-wave rather than @xmath1-wave symmetry .",
    "this difference is significant particularly since it implies the existence of gap nodes on the fermi surface and hence the existence of quasiparticle states of low energies .",
    "one might expect that quasiparticle excitations created at rather high energies through application of a laser pulse to the equilibrium sample or by some other means , would rapidly relax towards the lowest energy states available and accumulate in the nodal regions of the gap on the fermi surface where the density of excited states goes linearly in energy .",
    "the fast relaxation processes can proceed through the electron - electron interaction which is strong in the cuprates and also through coupling to the phonons.@xcite the phonons are a separate system of excitations which can share in the excess energy provided by the excitation source .",
    "this is to be contrasted to what happens in formulations of highly correlated systems in terms of boson exchange processes , such as the exchange of spin fluctuations@xcite in the case of the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid ( naffl ) model .",
    "while such exchange processes can equilibrate the energy , they do not take it out of the electronic system .",
    "another feature of @xmath0- as opposed to @xmath1-wave non - equilibrium superconductivity is that , as has been argued by feenstra _ et al._,@xcite the final stage of equilibration which proceeds through recombination of nodal quasiparticles into cooper pairs , may take a much larger time than in @xmath1-wave because of restrictions on the kinematics .",
    "new fast laser pulse techniques have helped greatly in the study of non - equilibrium state in cuprates .",
    "these techniques have recently been used in lead@xcite to measure the conductivity @xmath5 under non - equilibrium conditions as a function of frequency in the entire infrared range .",
    "similar experiments in the cuprates should be possible and we hope this paper will stimulate such work . here",
    "we provide a calculation of non - equilibrium effects just before recombination on the optical conductivity of a @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "we also consider explicitely the microwave region where analytic results can be obtained .",
    "very recently nicol and carbotte@xcite studied the effect of a non - equilibrium distribution of quasiparticles on the gap in a bcs @xmath0-wave superconductor . in this work two",
    "well established models coming from the literature on conventional non - equilibrium superconductors are employed .",
    "these are the @xmath3-model by owen and scalapino@xcite and the @xmath2-model of parker.@xcite these models , while very simple , have been useful in conceptualizing what can happen , in planning , and interpreting experiments . in some sense",
    "they represent two extreme limits between which the true distribution might be expected to fall .",
    "the @xmath3-model assumes that the excess quasiparticles rapidly accumulate in the lowest quasiparticle energy states available which is around the gap @xmath6 in @xmath1-wave but is around zero in @xmath0-wave where the density of states shows a linear in energy dependence",
    ". a finite chemical potential @xmath3 ( for the quasiparticles ) is used to describe the occupation .",
    "the other extreme is to assume that the excess quasiparticles equilibrate at some new temperature @xmath2 larger than the sample temperature @xmath7 . in both cases",
    "the system is not in thermal equilibrium because the measurement is to be made before the final recombination process into cooper pairs proceed .",
    "this is assumed to be the largest time scale in the relaxation process .",
    "there are significant differences in behavior for @xmath0-wave as compared to @xmath1-wave .",
    "for example in terms of the excess quasiparticle density @xmath8 ( to be defined more precisely later ) the reduction in the gap @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 for both , @xmath2 and @xmath3 models in @xmath1-wave , but for @xmath0-wave it goes like @xmath11 for the @xmath3-model and @xmath12 in the @xmath2 model .",
    "these fundamentally different dependences on @xmath8 , linear in @xmath1-wave , and to a 3/2 power in @xmath0-wave can be simply understood .",
    "the presence of excess quasiparticles blocks states around the fermi surface which would otherwise be available to form the condensate in a variational sense . in @xmath0-wave ,",
    "the excitations are assumed to gather around the nodal regions . in these regions",
    "the gap is small and contributes little to the condensation energy so that blocking such states is less effective than in the @xmath1-wave case where the gap is everywhere finite and equal to @xmath6 .    in their paper nicol and carbotte@xcite",
    "consider explicitly the case of tunneling in a normal - insulator - superconductor ( n - i - s ) junction with a non - equilibrium distribution on the superconducting side .",
    "they also address the case of pump probe experiments which claim to measure the temperature dependence of the excess quasiparticles @xmath13 before final recombination into cooper pairs . in the present paper",
    "we extend the work to the optical conductivity .",
    "such calculations exist in the @xmath1-wave case@xcite based on an appropriate generalization of the dirty limit mattis - bardeen formula@xcite for the optical conductivity . here",
    "we consider the @xmath0-wave case@xcite and treat explicitly both , the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 model and compare results obtained for the same value of excess quasiparticles @xmath8 .",
    "since in many aspects both models give the same qualitative physics , although there are some important differences which we will note , we can expect that more realistic distributions would not be so different .    in section ii",
    "we introduce some elements of the theory of the optical conductivity @xmath14 as a function of frequency @xmath15 at temperature @xmath7 suitably generalized for the non - equilibrium case . in the @xmath2-model",
    "no formal changes to the formulas are needed , only the temperature is to be interpreted differently . in the @xmath3-model all necessary changes to the mathematical formulas can be incorporated through a change of the thermal factors . in section",
    "iii we present exact numerical results for the frequency dependence of the optical conductivity ( real and imaginary part ) as well as for the reflectance and the normalized reflectance difference due to an excess distribution ( @xmath8 ) of non - equilibrium quasiparticles which is the quantity that is directly measurable .",
    "results for the @xmath2 and @xmath3-model for the same @xmath8 are compared .",
    "section iv contains a number of analytic results for a regime in which the temperature is larger than the impurity scattering rate i.e. the weak scattering limit .",
    "comparison with exact numerical results is also given .",
    "dependences on the excess quasiparticle density @xmath8 are made explicit and helps physical understanding .",
    "a short conclusion is found in section v. an appendix contains some mathematical details .",
    "the non - equilibrium distribution in either @xmath2 or @xmath3-model does not change the symmetry of the gap .",
    "it does reduce its magnitude .",
    "in addition , the thermal factors which enter directly the infrared conductivity formula are also changed .",
    "these changes are modeled in one case by the introduction of a chemical potential @xmath3 and in the other by simply changing the temperature from @xmath7 , the temperature of the sample before application of a laser pulse , to @xmath2 the non - equilibrium quasiparticle temperature before final recombination . for simplicity , we will assume here that the initial sample temperature @xmath7 is sufficiently low that it can be considered to be zero . in the actual numerical work it is taken to be @xmath16k for convenience with a gap of @xmath17mev . for a bcs @xmath0-wave superconductor",
    "this choice corresponds to a @xmath4 of @xmath18k .",
    "if we further assume that the density of excess quasiparticles @xmath8 is small , we can obtain analytic results for the change in gap and for the corresponding value of @xmath3 and/or @xmath2 .",
    "the necessary results are to be found in the paper by nicol and carbotte.@xcite in the @xmath2-model @xmath19 and @xmath20 , while in the @xmath3-model @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "when this is done the impurities also formally enter the gap equation and in principle one should include these modifications along with those brought about by the non - equilibrium distribution of quasiparticles in the formula for the conductivity . here , for simplicity , we will not do this .",
    "the impurities do reduce the size of the @xmath0-wave gap amplitude but we will assume that this is already included in our initial choice of this parameter and simply treat the changes brought about by @xmath8 based on the pure case .",
    "assuming that the impurity concentration is very small as we wish to do here , this is sufficient .",
    "there will also be a corresponding effect of impurities on the chemical potential @xmath3 but this is also neglected in the limit of small impurity scattering . with this explanation",
