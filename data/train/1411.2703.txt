    "the general structure of the solution spaces is explored by the intertwining relations and crum s theorem  together with its modifications . the multiple darboux transformations are discussed generically . exact solvability in the schrdinger picture is explained by the _ shape invariance _ . the _ generic eigenvalue formula _ , _ unified rodrigues formulas _ and the _ forward / backward shift operators _  are deduced .",
    "the solvability in the heisenberg picture is derived based on the _ closure relation _ between the _ sinusoidal coordinate _ and the hamiltonian .",
    "the _ creation / annihilation _ operators  are introduced and their connection with the _ three term recurrence relations _ of the orthogonal polynomials is emphasised . the _ dynamical symmetry algebras _  generated by the hamiltonian and the creation / annihilation operators are also established for all the solvable systems in the heisenberg picture .",

    "the duality  between the pseudo virtual states  and the eigenstates is demonstrated .",
    "the next topic is exactly solvable scattering problems and their extensions in  [ sec : scat ] .",
    "after the definition of the _ scattering amplitudes _  , _ reflectionless potentials _  are derived from the trivial potential @xmath0 by multiple darboux transformations .",
    "_ multi - indexed scattering amplitudes _  are expressed in terms of the _ asymptotic exponents _  of the polynomial type seed solutions . as a typical example , various data of the soliton potential  are presented . the final section is for a summary and comments .",
    "basic symbols , definitions and some formulas are listed in appendix .",
    "we usually discuss three elementary examples of exactly solvable potentials , the harmonic oscillator , the radial oscillator and the pschl - teller potentials , which are indicated by the initial of the polynomials constituting the corresponding eigenfunctions , that is , the hermite ( h ) , the laguerre ( l ) and the jacobi ( j ) polynomials .    due to the length constraints",
