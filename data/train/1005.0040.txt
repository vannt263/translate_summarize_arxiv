    "precessing orbits fill annuli , which also exert mutual torques ; however , since these torques are perpendicular to @xmath19 , they may change only the direction , not the magnitude of @xmath19 . this effect is dubbed vector resonant relaxation ( vrr ) , and its coherence time is given by the time required for orbital planes to change .",
    "in a spherically symmetric system the only mechanism that changes orbital planes is the relaxation itself .",
    "hence for vrr the coherence time is given by setting @xmath488 in equation  ( [ eq : dldt ] ) : @xmath489 and the relaxation time , equation  ( [ eq : trrs ] ) , becomes @xmath490 which is @xmath491 times shorter than the scalar relaxation time .",

    "hence , the typical rate of change of angular momentum is @xmath496 comparison with ( [ eq : dldt ] ) shows that the rate of change of angular momentum due to unbalanced torques from the other stars ( rr ) is greater than the rate of regular precession if @xmath497 .",
    "however , the coherence time for rr is a _ typical _ precession time of stars in the cluster , @xmath498 , whereas pyramids change angular momentum on a longer timescale @xmath499 . on the other hand , in the case of rr",
    "the angular momentum continues to change in a random - walk manner on timescale longer than @xmath481 , while in the case of precession in triaxial potential its variation is bounded .",
    "next we consider vrr , which corresponds to changes in orbital planes defined by the angles @xmath24 and @xmath500 .",
    "the frequency of orbital plane precession in a triaxial potential , @xmath56 , is @xmath501 for low-@xmath57 orbits ( pyramids and saucers ) and even lower for other orbits ( figure  [ fig : frequencies ] ) .",
    "the corresponding timescale may be written as @xmath502 comparison with the vrr timescale ( [ eq : trrv ] ) shows that @xmath503 .",
    "for the milky way , these two timescales are roughly equal at @xmath504  pc ( figure  [ fig : timescales ] ) . for sufficiently large @xmath480",
    "the regular precession due to triaxial torques goes on faster than the relaxation , so the coherence time for vrr is now defined by orbit precession , and the relaxation time itself becomes even longer . on the other hand , for small enough @xmath480 the vrr destroys orientation of orbital planes before they are substantially affected by triaxial torques .",
    "it seems that vrr in triaxial ( or even axisymmetric ) systems can be suppressed by regular orbit precession ; we defer the detailed analysis of relaxation for a future study .",
    "so far we have considered the torques arising under rr as being independent of the torques due to the elongated star cluster .",
    "suppose instead that we _",
    "identify _ the @xmath505 torques that drive rr with the torques due to the triaxial distortion .",
    "the justification is as follows : during the coherent rr phase , the gravitational potential from @xmath480 orbit - averaged stars can be represented in terms of a multipole expansion .",
    "if the lowest - order nonspherical terms in that expansion happen to coincide with the potential generated by a uniform - density triaxial cluster , the behavior of orbits in the coherent rr regime would be identical to what was derived above for orbits in a triaxial nucleus .",
    "we stress that this is a contrived model ; in general , an expansion of the orbit - averaged potential of @xmath480 stars will contain nonzero dipole , octupole etc .",
    "terms that depend in some complicated way on radius",
    ". nevertheless the comparison seems worth making since ( as we argue below ) there is one important feature of the motion that should depend only weakly on the details of the potential decomposition .",
    "equating the torques due to rr @xmath506 with those due to a triaxial cluster , @xmath507 our ansatz becomes @xmath508    as shown above (  [ sec_gr ] ) , gr sets a lower limit to the angular momentum of a pyramid orbit ( equation  [ eq : ell_min_small ] ) : @xmath509 the third term comes from setting @xmath510 , the maximum value for a pyramid orbit , while the fourth term uses our ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) and the definition ( [ eq : defkappa ] ) of @xmath354 . expressed in terms of eccentricity ,",
    "@xmath511 there is another way to motivate this result that does not depend on a detailed knowledge of the behavior of pyramid orbits . if we require that the gr precession time : @xmath512 ( eq .  [ nu_gr ] ) be shorter than the time @xmath513 for torques to change @xmath57 by of order itself , then @xmath514 as above . in other words , when @xmath515 , gr precession is so rapid that the @xmath505 torques are unable to change the angular momentum significantly over one precessional period .    in order for this limiting angular momentum to be relevant to rr ,",
    "the timescale for changes in the background potential should be long compared with the time over which an orbit with @xmath516 appreciably changes its angular momentum .",
    "as just shown , the latter timescale is @xmath517 the former timescale is the coherence time for vrr , equation  ( [ eq : tcohvrr ] ) : @xmath518 the condition @xmath519 is then @xmath520 or @xmath521 applying this to the center of the milky way , the condition becomes @xmath522 which is likely to be satisfied beyond a few mpc from sgra@xmath523 .    on timescales longer than @xmath524 ,",
    "the torques driving rr will change direction .",
    "this is roughly equivalent in our simple model to changing the orientation of the triaxial ellipsoid , or to changing @xmath377 at fixed @xmath57 .",
    "such changes might induce an orbit to evolve to values of @xmath57 lower than @xmath174 , by advancing down the narrow `` neck '' in the lower left portion of figure  [ fig : ell_min_max ] .",
    "however such evolution would be disfavored , for two reasons : ( 1 ) it would require a series of correlated changes in the background potential , increasingly so as @xmath57 became small ; ( 2 ) as @xmath57 decreased and @xmath525 increased , changes in the background potential would occur on timescales progressively longer than the gr precession time , and adiabatic invariance would tend to preserve @xmath57 (  4.4 ) .",
    "these predictions can in principle be tested via direct @xmath480-body integration of small-@xmath480 systems including post - newtonian accelerations ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a lower limit to the angular momentum for orbits near a massive bh could have important implications for the rate of gravitational wave events due to extreme - mass - ratio inspirals , or emris @xcite . the critical eccentricity at which the orbital evolution of a @xmath526 compact object begins to be dominated by gravitational wave emission is @xmath527 with @xmath528 the relaxation time ( e.g. * ? ?",

    "we also limit the discussion to orbits within the bh influence radius , @xmath533 , where our analysis is valid and where orbits are typically regular (   [ sec_realspace ] ) arises from the coupling of the orbit - averaged and radial motions . ] . beyond @xmath534 , centrophilic ( mostly chaotic )",

    "the triaxial component of the potential is highly uncertain ; one source would be the nuclear bar with density @xmath540 @xcite , yielding a triaxiality coefficient at @xmath541  pc of @xmath542 .",
    "we also considered a larger value , @xmath543 , which may be justified by some kind of asymmetry on spatial scales closer to @xmath6 than the bar . in this model ,",
    "the precession time due to the spherical component of the potential , @xmath544 for a circular orbit , is independent of radius and equals @xmath545  yr ; the two - body relaxation time is also constant ( @xmath546  yr ) , and timescales for scalar and vector resonant relaxation are given by equation  ( [ eq : trrs ] ) , ( [ eq : trrv ] ) with stellar mass @xmath547 .",

    "we first estimate the radius @xmath556 that separates the empty ( @xmath285 ) and full loss cone regimes .",
    "as noted in the previous section , gr precession prevents a pyramid orbit from reaching arbitrarily low angular momenta ; the radius beyond which capture becomes possible is roughly @xmath556 . using equation  ( [ eq : defqh ] ) with @xmath557 ( the maximum value for pyramids ) and equations  ( [ eq : nu_p ] ) , ( [ ell_bullet ] ) , the condition @xmath317 translates to @xmath558 if we take @xmath4 to be @xmath6 , and @xmath559 and @xmath460 as the density and velocity dispersion at this radius , we obtain @xmath560 the radius @xmath556 typically lies in the range @xmath561 , weakly dependent on the parameters . since regular pyramid orbits exist only for @xmath562 ( figure  [ fig : proportion_r ] ) , there is evidently a fairly narrow range of radii for which capture of stars from pyramid orbits is possible .",
    "however pyramid - like , centrophilic can exist at much larger radii @xcite .",
    "next we make a rough estimate of the pyramid draining time at @xmath563 , using the expression ( [ eq : rate2 ] ) for the flux in the full loss cone regime , @xmath564 ; @xmath322 ( the fraction of phase space occupied by the loss cone ) is given by equation  ( [ eq : fraction_gr ] ) with @xmath565 , @xmath566 ( equation  [ ell_min_max_approx ] ) : @xmath567 a more exact calculation of @xmath568 for the milky way , based on numerical analysis of properties of orbits sampled from the entire phase space , is shown in figure  [ fig : timescales ] .    finally , we estimate the total capture rate for all pyramids inside @xmath6 , using @xmath569 as a typical timescale and applying ( [ mbhsigma ] , [ rbh ] , [ t_dr ] ) : @xmath570 the capture rate from pyramids is then @xmath571 for the milky way we find @xmath572yr@xmath465 for @xmath62 and @xmath573yr@xmath465 for @xmath543 .",
    "this capture rate should be compared with that due to two - body relaxation , which is estimated to be @xcite @xmath574 thus even for a milky way - sized galaxy , the capture rate of pyramids could be comparable with or greater than that due to two - body relaxation . for more massive galaxies",
    "this inequality becomes even stronger .",

    "the motion can be described as a perturbation of keplerian motion ; we derive the orbit - averaged equations and explore their solutions both analytically ( when the triaxiality is small ) and numerically .",
    "orbits are found to be mainly regular in this region .",
    "there exist three families of tube orbits ; a fourth orbital family , the pyramids , can be described as eccentric keplerian ellipses that librate in two directions about the short axis of the triaxial figure . at the `` corners '' of the pyramid , the angular momentum reaches zero , which means that stars on these orbits can be captured by the bh .",
    "we derive expressions for the rate at which stars on pyramid orbits would be lost to the bh ; there are many similarities with the more standard case of diffusional loss cone refilling , but also some important differences , due to the fact that the approach to the loss cone is deterministic for the pyramids , rather than statistical .",
    "the inclusion of general relativistic precession is shown to impose a lower bound on the angular momentum .",
    "we argue that a similar lower bound should apply to orbital evolution in the case that the torques are due to resonant relaxation .",
    "the rate of consumption of stars from pyramid orbits is likely to be substantially greater than the rate due to two - body relaxation in the most luminous galaxies , although in the absence of mechanisms for orbital repopulation , these high consumption rates would only be maintained until such a time as the pyramid orbits have been drained ; however the latter time can be measured in billions of years .",
