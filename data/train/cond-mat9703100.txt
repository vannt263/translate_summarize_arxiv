    "although there have been much studies on the impurity doping effects in high @xmath0 superconductors,@xmath2 it has not been successful to understand the underlying physics . in particular , the decrease of @xmath0 due to impurity scattering is not fast enough to support the anisotropic pairing model , such as d - wave or anisotropic s - wave pairing . in conventional low @xmath0 superconductors",
    ", it was shown that the abrikosov and gorkov s ( ag ) green function theory is in conflict with the anderson s theory of dirty superconductors.@xmath3 the anderson s theory predicted no substantial decrease of @xmath0 with ordinary impurity substitution , while the ag theory leads to a large decrease of @xmath0 , which varies linearly with impurity concentration . for magnetic impurity effects ,",
    "the @xmath0 reduction caused by exchange scattering was found to be suppressed by adding non - magnetic impurities or radiation damage,@xmath4 which contradicts to the ag theory . in weak localization limit",
    ", ordinary impurities also decrease @xmath0 , which is beyond the anderson s theory .",
    "previously , this feature was attributed to the enhanced coulomb repulsion due to impurities,@xmath5 however , tunneling experiments did not show any increase of the coulomb repulsion.@xmath6    in this paper , we present some of our recent theoretical work@xmath7 on the impurity effects in conventional superconductors , which describe successfully unexplained experimental results .",
    "we first discuss the magnetic impurity effect and show why ordinary impurities and radiation damage suppress the @xmath0 reduction caused by magnetic impurities within the framework of the bcs theory .",
    "the ordinary impurity effect is considered both in dirty and weak localization limits . in weak localization limit , where the anderson s theorem is not valid ,",
    "@xmath0 is suppressed because of the amplitude modulation of the wavefunction caused by impurity scattering . in two - dimensional samples",
    ", it is shown that the critical sheet resistance for the suppression of superconductivity depends on superconducting material , in good agreement with experiments.@xmath8 we point out that the impurity doping and ion - beam - induced damage in high @xmath0 superconductors give rise to a metal - insulator transition and thereby suppress @xmath0 .",
    "magnetic impurities suppress strongly the transition temperatures of singlet - pairing superconductors .",
    "the magnetic interaction between a conduction electron at @xmath9 and a magnetic solute at @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 represents the pauli spin operators .",
    "employing the degenerate scattered - state pairs with the magnetic scattering effect , kim and overhauser@xmath14 showed that the phonon - mediated matrix elements are expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the average over @xmath17 and the spin direction @xmath18 of the solutes . here",
    "@xmath19 is the relative singlet amplitude of the basis pair when both the electrons are near @xmath9 . in the case of magnetic scattering",
    ", the singlet amplitude of the cooper pair is reduced , and consequently @xmath0 is decreased .",
    "notice that only the magnetic impurities within the bcs coherence distance @xmath20 ( for a pure superconductor ) from the cooper pair s center of mass reduce both the singlet amplitude and the pairing interaction .",
    "then , one finds @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the mean free path for the exchange scattering only and @xmath24 is the fermi velocity . here",
    ", we use an iterative method to calculate @xmath0 from the bcs gap equation .",
    "the change of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath25 ( for a pure metal ) can be easily calculated to the first order in impurity concentration , such as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the electron - phonon coupling constant and @xmath28 is the spin - disorder scattering time . since @xmath29 is inversely proportional to @xmath27 , the initial slope ( versus @xmath30 )",
    "depends on superconductor , indicating that this slope is not the universal constant , while the universal behavior was proposed by the ag theory . as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , the critical temperatures of weakly - coupled superconductors are found to decrease rapidly with increasing of magnetic impurities , as compared to strongly - coupled superconductors .    for the conduction electrons with a mean free path @xmath31 , which is smaller than @xmath20 ,",
    "the effective coherence length is reduced to @xmath32 then , the reduction of @xmath0 by magnetic impurities is significantly suppressed because the number of magnetic impurities within the distance of @xmath33 is very small .",
    "this behavior was first observed by co - doping with non - magnetic impurities that result in the decrease of @xmath31.@xmath34 a similar compensation effect was also observed by radiation damage ; for pure and mn - implanted in - films , the change of @xmath0 were found to be 2.2 and 0.3 k , respectively , after an exposure to a 275 kev @xmath35-ion fluence of 2.2@xmath36.@xmath37 this compensation effect contradicts to the traditional belief that @xmath29 in magnetically doped superconductors is unaffected by non - magnetic scatterings.@xmath38      to describe the ordinary impurity effect , anderson introduced the exact scattered states @xmath39 for the conduction electrons in a metal with ordinary impurities , which form time - reversed scattered state pairs .",
    "the scattered state @xmath39 can be expanded in terms of plane waves @xmath40 , such as @xmath41 then , the phonon - mediated matrix elements between the time - reversed pairs are written as@xmath42 @xmath43 although the correction term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 8) is negligibly small in dirty limit , it is important in weak localization limit . consequently , the anderson s theorem is valid only in dirty limit , to the first order in impurity concentration.@xmath42    it was shown@xmath44 that the tsuneto s strong coupling theory@xmath45 fails to explain the existence of the localization correction in the phonon - mediated interaction . alternatively , from the real space formalism of the strong coupling theory with the time - reversed pairs ,",
    "kim@xmath44 obtained a strong coupling gap equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the debye frequency . here",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the matsubara frequency and the electron energy , respectively . using the wavefunction in eq .",
    "( 7 ) , one can easily derive the formula of eq .",
    "( 8) from eq .",
    "we point out that @xmath52 gives the change of the phonon - mediated interaction due to impurities , and it decays exponentially for the localized states . in the tsuneto s theory , however , it remains unchanged , even if the wavefunctions are localized .    for the strongly localized states , since both the phonon - mediated interaction and the conductivity decay exponentially , they are expected to have the same correction term in weak localization limit .",
    "kaveh and mott@xmath53 showed that the wavefunction for the weakly localized states may be written as a mixture of power - law and extended wavefuctions . employing their wavefunctions and considering only the impurities within the distance of @xmath33 , the following relations for the matrix elements were obtained;@xmath54 @xmath55 , \\\\",
    "v_{nn'}^{2d } & \\cong &     -v[1-{2\\over \\pi k_{f}\\ell}ln(l/\\ell ) ] , \\\\",
    "v_{nn'}^{1d } & \\cong &     -v[1-{1\\over ( \\pi k_{f}a)^{2}}(l/\\ell-1)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath56 are the elastic and inelastic mean free paths , respectively , and @xmath57 is the radius of an one - dimensional wire .    solving the bcs gap equation with the matrix element of eq .",
    "( 12 ) , the change of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath25 satisfies the relation @xmath58 for bulk materials and this result is in good agreement with experiments,@xmath59 as shown in fig .",
    "2 . in homogeneous two - dimensional thin films ,",
    "an empirical formula was obtained,@xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the sheet resistance , and in fact this formula can be derived by putting eq .",
    "( 13 ) into the bcs gap equation .",
    "previously , the decrease of @xmath0 due to disorder was attributed to the enhanced coulomb repulsion,@xmath5 whereas tunneling measurements do not support this picture.@xmath6 the dirty boson theory@xmath63 predicted the universal critical sheet resistance of @xmath64 for the suppression of superconductivity in thin films .",
    "however , we find that from eq . ( 13 ) the critical sheet resistance is not universal but sample - dependent , which agrees with experiments.@xmath65",
    "there is currently considerable interest in the symmetry of the superconducting state in high @xmath0 superconductors.@xmath66 impurity doping studies may give a clue of resolving this problem .",
    "since the normal - state transport behavior of the cuprates is so anomalous , the impurity doping effects on the superconducting state may not be easy to understand .",
    "we note that almost all the experiments with cu ions substituted by other metal ions show the metal - insulator transition driven by impurity dopings.@xmath67 thus , the decrease of @xmath0 seems to be closely related to the wavefunction localization .",
    "if the d - wave pairing and the fermi liquid theory are assumed in the cuprates , since @xmath0 decreases much faster with increasing of impurities,@xmath14 the superconductivity may disappear before the metal - insulator transition is reached . in ion - beam irradiation and ion implantation experiments@xmath68 as well as",
    "@xmath69 samples,@xmath70 the metal - insulator transitions were also found in the doping region , where @xmath0 drops to zero .",
    "this anomalous impurity doping effect seems to imply that the landau s quasi - particle picture is not applicable for the cuprates . to understand this anomalous behavior , we may need to understand the impurity effect on the normal state .",
    "recently , suryanarayanan et al.@xmath71 found the recovery of superconductivity in @xmath72 when y is substituted by ca ; the values of @xmath0 were found to be 0 , 29 , and 47 k for @xmath73 and 0.2 , respectively .",
    "this results may be understood if we consider the importance of the metal - insulator transition caused by impurity doping . when @xmath74 , the increase of al impurities changes the system to the insulating state with the mobility edge lying below the fermi energy .",
    "then , since the conducting electrons are localized , the superconductivity transition does not appear .",
    "if holes are added in the cu - o planes with ca impurities , since the fermi energy moves below the mobility edge , assuming the mobility edge unchanged , and the electrons are extended , ca - doped systems become superconducting .",
    "further experimental studies are needed to understand clearly the impurity - driven metal - insulator transition in the cuprates .",
    "within the framework of the bcs theory , we have discussed the magnetic and non - magnetic impurity effects on conventional superconductors . in particular , we find that the critical sheet resistance for the suppression of superconductivity in thin films is not universal but sample - dependent . for high @xmath0 superconductors ,",
    "it is pointed out that the metal - insulator transition driven by impurity doping is important in understanding both the normal and superconducting states of the cuprates .",
