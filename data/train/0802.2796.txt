    "large scale structures like galaxies and clusters of galaxies are believed to have formed by gravitational amplification of small perturbations @xcite .",
    "much of the matter in galaxies and clusters of galaxies is the so called dark matter that is believed to be essentially non - interacting and non - relativistic .",
    "the dark matter responds mainly to gravitational forces and by virtue of larger density than the ordinary or baryonic matter , the assembly of matter into haloes and the large scale structure is driven by gravitational instability of initial perturbations .",
    "galaxies are believed to form when gas in highly over - dense haloes cools and collapses to form stars in large numbers @xcite .",
    "evolution of density perturbations due to gravitational interaction in a cosmological setting is , therefore , the key process for the study of large scale structure and its evolution and a very important one in formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the basic equations for this are well known and are easy to solve when the amplitude of perturbations is small . at this stage ,",
    "perturbations at each scale evolve independently on perturbations at other scales and mode coupling is sub - dominant . once the amplitude of perturbations at relevant scales becomes large the coupling with perturbations at other scales becomes important and can not be ignored . the equation for evolution of density perturbations can not be solved for generic perturbations in this regime , generally called the non - linear regime .",
    "one can use dynamical approximations for studying mildly non - linear perturbations . statistical approximations and scaling relations can be used if a limited amount of information is sufficient @xcite . in general , however , we require cosmological n - body simulations to follow the detailed evolution of the system .    in n - body simulations , we simulate a representative region of the universe . this region is a large but finite volume .",
    "effect of perturbations at scales smaller than the mass resolution of the simulation , and of perturbations at scales larger than the box is ignored .",
    "indeed , even perturbations at scales comparable to the box are under sampled .",
    "it has been known for a long time that perturbations at scales much larger than the simulation volume can affect the results of n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "it is possible to quantify these effects and even estimate whether a given simulation volume is large enough to be representative or not @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for gravitational dynamics in an expanding universe , perturbations at small scales do not influence collapse of large scale perturbations in a significant manner as far as the correlation function or power spectrum at large scales are concerned .",
    "this has led to a belief that ignoring perturbations at scales much smaller than the scales of interest does not affect results of n - body simulations .",
    "recently we have shown that if large scale collapse is highly symmetric then presence of perturbations at much smaller scales affect evolution of density perturbations at large scales @xcite .",
    "here we propose to study the effect of small scales on collapse of perturbations at large scales in a generic situation .",
    "substructure can play an important role in the relaxation process .",
    "it can induce mixing in phase space @xcite , or change halo profiles by introducing transverse motions @xcite , and , gravitational interactions between small clumps can bring in an effective collisionality even for a collisionless fluid @xcite .",
    "thus it is important to understand the role played by substructure in gravitational collapse and relaxation in the context of an expanding background .    whether the evolution of density perturbations is affected by collapsed structure or not depends on the significance of mode coupling between these scales .",
    "we summarize the known results about mode coupling here .    *",
    "large scales influence small scales in a significant manner .",
    "if the initial conditions are modified by filtering out perturbations at small scales then mode coupling generates small scale power .",
    "if the scale of filtration is smaller than the scale of non - linearity at the final epoch then the non - linear power spectrum as well as the appearance of large scale structure is similar to the original case @xcite . * non - linear evolution _ drives",
    "_ every model towards a weak attractor ( @xmath0 ) in the mildly non - linear regime ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "* in absence of initial perturbations at large scales , mode coupling generates power with ( @xmath2 ) that grows very rapidly at early times @xcite .",
    "there are a number of explanations for this feature , ranging from second order perturbation theory to momentum and mass conserving motion of a group of particles .",
    "the @xmath3 tail can also be derived from the full non - linear equation for density . *",
    "if we consider large scale perturbations to be highly symmetric , e.g. planar , then small scale fluctuations play a very important role in the non - linear evolution of perturbations at large scales @xcite .",
    "while the effect of large scales on small scales is known to be significant , particularly if the larger scales are comparable to the scale of non - linearity , the effect of small scales on larger scales is known to be small in most situations . even though this effect has not been studied in detail ,",
    "many tools have been developed that exploit the presumed smallness of the influence of small scales on large scales @xcite .",
    "considerable work has been done in recent years on the effects of the _ pre - initial _ conditions used in n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "we use the term pre - initial conditions to refer to the distribution of particles on which the initial density and velocity perturbations are imprinted .",
    "the pre - initial conditions are expected to have no density perturbations or symmetry , but it can be shown that at least one of these requirements must be relaxed in practice .",
    "this can lead to growth of some modes in a manner different from that expected in the cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "our work allows us to estimate the effect such discrepant modes can have on the non - linear evolution of clustering at these scales .",
    "our work also allows us to understand the effects that may arise if the primordial power spectrum deviates strongly from a power law at small scales .",
    "the evolution of perturbations at small scales depends strongly on the mass and force resolution .",
    "a high force resolutions can lead to better modelling of dense haloes , but gives rise to two body collisions @xcite . a high force resolution without a corresponding mass resolution can also give misleading results as we can not probe _ shapes _ of collapsed objects @xcite .",
    "in addition , discreteness and stochasticity also limit our ability to measure physical quantities in simulations , and these too need to be understood properly @xcite . in all such cases , the errors in modelling",
    "is large at small scales .",
    "it is important to understand how such errors may spread to larger scales and affect physical quantities .    [",

    "our goal is to understand the effects of variations in the initial power spectrum at small scales on other scales . for this",
    ", we study the three models at two representative epochs : one where the scale of modification is linear , and the second epoch when the scale of non - linearity is larger than the scales where the power spectra differ from each other .",
    "we refer to these epochs as an early epoch and a late epoch .",
    "the scale of non - linearity in the reference model at the early epoch is @xmath4  grid lengths and the corresponding scale at the late epoch is @xmath5  grid lengths .",
    "the wave number @xmath6 corresponds to @xmath7  grid lengths and becomes non - linear at an intermediate epoch .",
    "figure  2 shows the distribution of particles in a thin slice from simulations of the three models .",
    "the left column shows the distribution at the early epoch whereas the right column shows the same slice at late times .",
    "the middle row shows the reference model ( model i ) , the top row is for model with less power at small scales ( model ii ) and the bottom row is for the model with excess power at small scales ( model iii ) .",
    "the large scale distribution of particles is similar in all the three models for both epochs , although there are significant differences at small scales .",
    "differences are more prominent between model ii and the other models , whereas the differences between models i and iii are less obvious .",
    "also , differences between the models diminish as we go from the early epoch to the late epoch .",
    "figure  3 compares the models in a more quantitative manner .",
    "we have plotted the amplitude of clustering @xmath8 as a function of @xmath9 for the three models at an early epoch ( top - left frame ) and at a later epoch ( top - right frame ) .",
    "the differences between the amplitude of clustering are more pronounced at the early epoch , though even here the differences are much smaller than those seen in figure  1 where the linearly extrapolated @xmath10 has been plotted . at late times , models i and iii have an indistinguishable @xmath8 whereas model ii has a slightly smaller amplitude of clustering at small scales when compared with these two models . at very large @xmath9 compared to the scale of modification , all models have the same @xmath11 even at the early epoch .    second row in figure  3 shows @xmath12 as a function of scale for the three models . as before , the left panel is for the early epoch and the right panel is for the late epoch . at large scales , larger than the scale of modification ( @xmath7 grid lengths ) , the three models agree well .",
    "there are significant differences at small scales , particularly at the early epoch .",
    "model ii has the highest skewness , whereas model iii has the smallest skewness at small scales .",
    "this ranking does not change with time , though the differences between models decrease with further evolution of the system .",
    "the bottom row in figure  3 shows the number density of haloes as a function of mass .",
    "mass here is shown in units of mass of each particle .",
    "haloes were identified using the friends - of - friends algorithm ( fof ) with a linking length of @xmath13 .",
    "we chose this linking length in order to avoid identifying smooth filaments in model ii as haloes .",
    "haloes with a minimum of @xmath14 particles were considered for this plot .",
    "we find that model iii has the largest number of haloes around the scale of modification , whereas model ii has the least number of haloes at this scale . indeed , at the early epoch , model ii has a much lower number of haloes at all mass scales when compared with model i and model iii . at late times , model ii continues to have fewer small mass haloes though it almost matches the other two masses at larger masses .",
    "we find that the two point correlation function does not retain any information about differences in initial conditions after the scale where such differences are present becomes sufficiently non - linear .",
    "this is in agreement with results of earlier studies @xcite .",
    "skewness is a slightly better indicator than the two point correlation function , in that it retains some information about the missing power at small scales in model ii even after the cutoff scale becomes non - linear .",
    "it does not retain much information about the excess power that is added at small scales in model iii .",
    "one possible reason for this is that the cutoff affects the shape of the power spectrum at @xmath15 whereas the effect of adding extra power is more localized .",
    "we may conclude that skewness is able to retain information about a cutoff in the initial power spectrum if the cutoff scale is not strongly non - linear .",
    "this may not have implications for observational signatures of a cutoff as observations of galaxy clustering are restricted to the redshift space and it has been shown that redshift space distortions in the non - linear regime erase differences between models @xcite .    the number density of haloes at scales comparable to and smaller than the cutoff is smaller than that in the other models even after the cutoff scale becomes non - linear .",
    "the mass function appears to be the most sensitive indicator of a cutoff in the power spectrum in the mildly non - linear regime .",
    "we find that the memory of localized variations initial conditions is erased in the quasi - linear regime .",
    "this erasure is almost complete in measures of the second moment , e.g. the two point correlation function shown here .",
    "we have checked that the same is true of the power spectrum and rms fluctuations in mass .",
    "this loss of information has been pointed out in earlier work @xcite .",
    "the skewness appears to be a better indicator of a cutoff in the initial power spectrum , at least in the quasi - linear regime .",
    "we find that the skewness for model ii is distinctly higher than that for model i or model iii , even when the scale of nonlinearity is much larger than the cutoff scale .",
    "number densities of haloes is a very faithful indicator of the cutoff , even at late times .",
    "this is to be expected given that the number density of haloes can be predicted fairly accurately using the press - schechter mass function @xcite that relies only on the initial power spectrum .",
    "the question now arises as to how may we interpret these results . here",
    "we would like to recall the key conclusion of paper  i in the present series @xcite . in paper",
    "i , we studied the collapse of a plane wave with varying amount of collapsed haloes at a much smaller scale ( as compare to wavelength of the plane wave ) .",
    "we found that the thickness of pancake that forms due to collapse of the plane wave is smaller if collapsed haloes are present .",
    "the reason for smaller thickness is that gravitational interaction of infalling clumps takes away some of the longitudinal momentum and leads to an increase of the transverse momentum .",
    "thinner pancakes imply a higher density , and clumps are able to grow very rapidly in such an environment .",
    "we were motivated to study collapse of a plane wave as it is known from the zeldovich approximation that locally , generic collapse is planar leading to formation of pancakes .    in case of generic initial conditions that we consider here ,",
    "there is no fixed large scale that is collapsing as we have perturbations at all scales .",
    "however , we have ensured that perturbations at large scales are the same in all the three models . in this case",
    "the effect of power on large scales is to cause collapse around peaks of density , or equivalently , empty the voids .",
    "the latter picture is more attractive as it also tells us why collapse of perturbations at a scale leads to enhancement of power at smaller scales without any loss of power at the original scale : emptying under dense regions simply puts more and more matter in thin walls around the void that forms .",
    "we can say that power is transferred from the scale of perturbation , that essentially is the radius of the void that forms , to the scale of thickness of pancakes surrounding the void .",
    "as a given scale becomes non - linear , we begin to see voids corresponding to this scale .",
    "matter that collapsed at an earlier stage gets pushed into the pancakes surrounding the voids .",
    "this information about the shape of the initial power spectrum at scales smaller than the scale of non - linearity is mostly restricted to the distribution of matter within pancakes .",
    "this , in our view , explains the erasure of memory of initial conditions for the two point correlation function .",
    "the mass function and skewness are more sensitive to the arrangement of matter within pancakes and hence these remain different for the model with a cutoff .",
    "once the scale of cutoff becomes strongly non - linear , most of the perturbations at this scale are expected to be part of highly over dense haloes . at this stage , we expect that all indicators of clustering will loose information about the details of the initial power spectrum at this stage .    in models",
    "i and iii , there is significant amount of initial power at small scales .",
    "this leads to a fragmented appearance of pancakes and clearly pancakes can not be thinner than the clumps . in model ii , there is no initial power at small scales .",
    "power is generated at these scales by collapse of larger modes , power grows very rapidly at small scales and the non - linear power spectrum in this case catches up with the power spectrum for the other two models .",
    "model iii has significantly more power as compared with the reference model at small scales .",
    "this leads to a more rapid growth of perturbations at these scales , as is seen in the number density of collapsed haloes at the relevant scales at early times . at late times , these haloes are assimilated into bigger haloes and we rapidly loose any signatures of the excess power .",
    "we expect the excess power to lead to thinner pancakes , motivated by conclusions of paper  i. however , the scale of pancakes is such that this feature is not apparent .",
    "another approach towards understanding the lack of effect of variations in power spectrum at small scales on larger , non - linear scales is based on the equation for evolution of density contrast .",
    "it has been shown that the leading order effect of virialised haloes on modes at much larger scales vanishes at the leading order . in case of arbitrary motion of a group of particles ,",
    "a @xmath3 tail is generated in the power spectrum at @xmath16 if there is no initial power at these scales .",
    "in general the influence of motions of particles at small scales to density perturbations is limited due to the @xmath17 behaviour dependence in density contrast translates into a @xmath3 dependence in the power spectrum .",
    "] of the mode coupling terms in equations that describes the evolution of density contrast for a system of particles .",
    "the magnitude of the mode coupling at this order is proportional to the departure from virial equilibrium for the system of particles .",
    "it is possible to consider the equations and compute the leading order contribution of interacting haloes .",
    "clearly , this also must scale as @xmath18 for density contrast , but it is instructive to see if we can quantify the level to which the internal structure of clusters matters for coupling of density fluctuations . a detailed calculation and analysis of this",
    "is presented in a forthcoming manuscript ( bagla , in preparation ) .",
    "we summarise a few key points here .    *",
    "it can be shown that the leading order contribution to mode coupling for interacting haloes comes from the halo - halo interaction where the haloes may be assumed to be point masses .",
    "* there is a next to leading order contribution due to tidal interaction of clusters .",
    "* the two contributions scale as @xmath17 , making the contribution to power spectrum as @xmath19 .",
    "* the magnitude of the leading order term is proportional to the departure from virial equilibrium for haloes treated as point masses .",
    "the treatment can be generalised to an arbitrary number of haloes , and we can also study the effects of coupling between a cluster and the large scale density distribution .",
    "these conclusions explain the results of our numerical experiments , and give a reason as to why gravitational clustering in an expanding universe appears to be _ almost _ renormalizable .",
    "results presented in the preceeding section show that for a hierarchical model , there is little effect of features at small scales ( high wave number ) in power spectrum on collapse of perturbations at larger scales . at the same time , we see that the effect of features can be seen in several statistical indicators at the scales of features and also at smaller scales .",
    "the key conclusion that we can draw is that if we modify the power spectrum at small scales , there is no discernable effect of these modifications at larger scales .",
    "this has implications in several situations :    * cosmological n - body simulations start with initial conditions that do not sample the power spectrum at large wave numbers . in typical simulations of this type ,",
    "a grid is used to generate initial conditions and only modes up to the nyquist wave number are sampled . indeed , if the number of particles is smaller than the number of grid cells used for generating initial conditions , the effective upper limit to wave numbers is even more restricted @xcite .",
    "the missing part of the power spectrum does not have any impact on the evolution of non - linear structures at scales larger than the cutoff scale .",
    "we expect the effects of missing modes at large wave numbers to be less and less relevant as larger length scales ( smaller wave numbers ) become non - linear .",
    "* it has been pointed out that the choice of pre - initial conditions , and the epoch at which the initial conditions are set up can lead to spurious growth of some modes @xcite .",
    "clearly , these effects must be suppressed as the modes with spurious growth become non - linear . *",
    "generation of perturbations in the early universe , and their evolution towards the end of the inflationary phase can lead to a scale dependent evolution of modes @xcite .",
    "our work clearly shows that such features will be impossible to detect if these are at scales that are strongly non - linear and difficult to detect if these are at scales that are mildly non - linear . if scales where such variations occur are already non - linear then these variations do no affect collapse of larger scales .",
    "of course , if the scales where such variations occur are linear then these can be probed using galaxy clustering .",
    "numerical experiments for this study were carried out at cluster computing facility in the harish - chandra research institute ( http://cluster.mri.ernet.in ) . this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system ."
