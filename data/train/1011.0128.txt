    "exactly solvable models of interacting fermions in one - dimension ( 1d ) have attracted theoretical interest for more than half a century . before 1950 , it was not clear how to treat the schrdinger equation for a large system of interacting fermions .",
    "the first important breakthrough was achieved by tomonaga @xcite who showed that fermionic interactions in 1d can mediate new collective degrees of freedom that are approximately bosonic in nature .    in 1963",
    ", luttinger @xcite introduced an exactly solvable many - fermion model in 1d which consists of two types of particles , one with positive momentum and the other with negative momentum .",
    "however , luttinger s model suffers from several flaws which include the assumption that the fermions are spinless and massless , and more importantly an improperly filled negative energy dirac sea .",
    "mattis and lieb @xcite expanded on luttinger s work by correctly filling the negative energy states with `` holes '' . before that , lieb and liniger @xcite solved the 1d interacting bose gas with @xmath1-function interactions using bethe s hypothesis @xcite .",
    "later mcguire solved the equivalent spin-1/2 fermion problem for the special case where all fermions have the same spin except one having the opposite spin in the repulsive @xcite and attractive @xcite regimes .",
    "he showed that in the presence of an attractive potential a bound state is formed .",
    "further progress by lieb and flicker @xcite followed on the two down spin problem . in 1967 , yang @xcite solved the fermion problem for the most general case where the number of spin ups and spin downs are arbitrary by making use of bethe s hypothesis .",
    "at the same time , gaudin @xcite solved this problem for the ground state with no polarization .",
    "sutherland @xcite then showed that the fermion model with a general @xmath0 spin symmetry is integrable and the solution is given in terms of @xmath2 nested bethe ansatz ( ba ) equations . and in 1970 ,",
    "takahashi @xcite examined the structure of the bound states in the attractive regime with arbitrary spin and derived the ground state energy together with the distribution functions of bound states in terms of a set of coupled integral equations . using yang and yang s method @xcite for the boson case , takahashi @xcite and lai @xcite derived the so - called thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) equations for spin-1/2 fermions in both the repulsive and attractive regimes .",
    "the spin - string hypothesis describing the excited states of spin rapidities was also introduced by both authors .",
    "later on , schlottmann @xcite derived the tba equations for @xmath0 fermions with repulsive and attractive interactions .",
    "see also schlottmann s epic review article on exact results for highly correlated electron systems in 1d @xcite .",
    "the tba equations have been analyzed in several limiting cases , i.e. , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the temperature and @xmath8 is the interaction strength .",
    "the ground state properties and the elemental charge and spin excitations were also studied for some special cases .",
    "however , the tba equations for the attractive regime @xcite are not the most convenient for the analysis of phase transitions and thermodynamics . for the attractive case",
    ", it was shown that the ground state in the absence of symmetry breaking fields consists of spin neutral charge bound states of @xmath2 particles .",
    "the repulsive case however consists of freely propagating charge states and spin waves with different velocities .",
    "the phenomenon of spin - charge separation plays a ubiquitous role in the low energy physics of 1d systems @xcite .",
    "however , the physics of these models , such as the universal thermodynamics of tomonaga - luttinger liquids , quantum criticality and the universal nature of contact interaction , are largely still hidden in the complexity of the tba equations .",
    "it is thus important to develop new methods to extract the physics of 1d exactly solved many - body systems in order to bring them more closer to experiments .",
    "most recently , experimental advances in trapping and cooling atoms to very low temperatures allow a test of the theoretical predictions made so far . in particular , liao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite experimentally studied spin-1/2 fermions of ultracold @xmath9li atoms in a 2d array of 1d tubes with spin imbalance .",
    "the phase diagram was confirmed and it was discovered that a large fraction of a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo)-like phase lies in the trapping center accompanied by two wings of a fully paired phase or unpaired phase depending on the polarization .",
    "this observation verified the theoretical predictions @xcite regarding the phase diagram and pairing signature for the ground state of strongly attractive spin-1/2 fermions in 1d .",
    "although the fflo phase has not yet been observed directly , the experimental results pave the way to direct observation and characterization of fflo pairing @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the tba equations for a general 1d system of fermions with @xmath0 spin symmetry from sutherland s ba equations using the same approach as yang and yang for 1d bosons @xcite .",
    "both the repulsive and attractive cases are discussed .",
    "we also give the exact thermodynamics of the ground state of the attractive and repulsive cases in both the strong coupling and weak coupling limits .",
    "a general relationship between the different magnetic phases and the external magnetic field is discussed for the attractive case .",
    "how the external magnetic fields affect the different pairing phases in the attractive regime is also addressed .",
    "this paper gives a thorough derivation of many results in a recently published paper @xcite that provides the exact low temperature thermodynamics for strongly attractive @xmath0 fermions with zeeman splitting and shows that the system behaves like a universal tomonaga - luttinger liquid in the gapless phase .",
