    "these proofs are similar and higgins conjectured that they can be united to a single proof of a common generalization of the two theorems .    however , p.  r.  heath and p.  nickolas showed in  @xcite that there are difficulties in generalizing the proof and , in particular , e.  t.  ordman s proof of higgins s conjecture in  @xcite is incorrect .",

    "recall that a groupoid is a category in which every morphism is invertible .",
    "any group @xmath28 can be regarded as a groupoid with one object such that the automorphism group of the object is @xmath28 . if @xmath14 is a subgroup of @xmath28 then the _ standard covering _",
    "@xmath29 is a functor defined as follows .",
    "first , we define the groupoid @xmath30 .",
    "the objects are the right cosets of @xmath14 in @xmath28 .",
    "morphisms of @xmath30 are @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an arbitrary right coset and @xmath33",
    ". composition is defined by @xmath34 .",
    "for example , the automorphism group of the coset @xmath14 in @xmath30 is isomorphic to @xmath14 via the map @xmath35 .",
    "finally , @xmath36 is given by the formula @xmath37 .",
    "we will also think of a groupoid as an oriented graph where the vertices are the objects and the edges are the morphisms . in this sense",
    ", we will speak of connected groupoids , trees and so on .",
    "we will use free product of groupoids : let @xmath9 be groupoids whose objects are contained in a set @xmath38 .",
    "the free product of @xmath9 is the groupoid generated by the @xmath9 in which only the necessary relations hold .",
    "the objects of the free product are the objects of all the @xmath9 and hence is contained in @xmath38 .",
    "free product is similar to coproduct but some objects are identified ; that is the role of @xmath38 .",
    "for example , every groupoid is the free product of its connected components .",
    "if @xmath38 is a one - element set , this notion is exactly the free product of groups . in the following",
    ", @xmath38 is always the set of objects of the standard covering of a subgroup @xmath14 of a group @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath39 is a connected groupoid and @xmath40 is a spanning tree then @xmath40 generates a _ wide tree subgroupoid _ @xmath41 of @xmath39 , i.e.  a subgroupoid in which there is exactly one morphism between any two objects",
    ". then @xmath39 is isomorphic to the free product and the direct product of @xmath14 and @xmath41 , where @xmath14 is the automorphism group of an object .",
    "the canonical projection @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 denotes the unique isomorphism @xmath45 in @xmath41 .",
    "let us suppose now that @xmath46 is a free product of groups .",
    "now the idea of the groupoid proofs of kuro s theorem and higgins s theorem is that the free decomposition of @xmath28 lifts to a free decomposition @xmath47 where @xmath48 . using a suitable tree @xmath40 , the projection @xmath49 maps this decomposition to a free decomposition of @xmath14 which will satisfy the theorems .    in case of higgins s theorem ( theorem  [ th : grushko - higgins ] ) , let @xmath50 be a homomorphism such that @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "we choose the tree @xmath40 such that the wide tree subgroupoid @xmath41 generated by @xmath40 is contained in @xmath51 ( the full subgroupoid of @xmath30 consisting of morphisms mapped to identity by @xmath52 ) .",
    "if @xmath40 is chosen with care , we will have @xmath53 the condition @xmath54 will guarantee @xmath55 .",
    "see @xcite or @xcite for more details .    in case of kuro s theorem",
    ", we first decompose each @xmath56 into its connected components @xmath57 , which we further decompose to the group @xmath58 of one of its objects and a wide tree subgroupoid generated by a tree @xmath59 .",
    "this leads to the free decomposition : @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the groupoid freely generated by the morphisms in @xmath62 .",
    "note that a tree always generates a wide tree subgroupoid freely .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath63 is connected and hence contains a spanning tree @xmath40 .",
    "now @xmath64 gives the free decomposition : @xmath65 it is easily seen that @xmath66 for some @xmath67 and @xmath68 is a free group so this gives the kuro decomposition of @xmath14 .",
    "actually , @xmath69 is the unique isomorphism in @xmath70 between @xmath14 and the object at which @xmath58 is located . an easy argument , which we omit , yields that the @xmath67 form a set of representatives of double cosets @xmath19 .",
    "if we have chosen @xmath58 at the object @xmath14 whenever @xmath57 contains @xmath14 , then the coset @xmath20 will be represented by @xmath21 .",
    "higgins conjectured that both theorems can be proved using a common @xmath40 , which would lead to a common generalization of both theorems and their proofs .",
    "in  @xcite it is shown that in general there is no tree @xmath40 which is contained in both @xmath63 and @xmath51 , so such a generalization requires significant changes to the above proofs .",
    "first we prove that the @xmath24 in theorem  [ th : grushko - higgins ] has some nice properties .",
    "[ th : generalized - higgins ] suppose that a group homomorphism @xmath0 between free products satisfies @xmath1 for all @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath23 be a subgroup such that @xmath4",
    ". then @xmath5 such that for each @xmath17 we have @xmath6 , and there are representatives @xmath71 of double cosets @xmath19 such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , @xmath20 can be represented by @xmath21 for all @xmath17 simultaneously .",
    "we start with the proof of higgins s theorem and thus obtain a free decomposition of @xmath14 into the @xmath74 .",
    "now we use the proof of kuro s theorem for the tree @xmath40 .",
    "we decompose @xmath56 into its connected components @xmath57 and from every @xmath57 we select the automorphism group @xmath58 of an object .",
    "thus @xmath75 .",
    "it is not obvious whether we obtain a free decomposition like   but we still have @xmath76 for some representatives @xmath71 of double cosets @xmath77 .",
    "we also have @xmath78 .",
    "hence @xmath73 .",
    "the coset @xmath20 is represented by @xmath21 if we choose @xmath58 at the object @xmath14 when @xmath57 contains the object @xmath14 .          by lemma",
    "[ th : generalized - higgins ] , we have a decomposition @xmath79 with @xmath55 such that @xmath80 is contained in @xmath24 for some representatives @xmath71 of double cosets @xmath19 and @xmath81 .",
    "we do not claim that these representatives give a kuro type decomposition ; we will modify them .",
    "applying theorem  [ th : kurosh ] to @xmath24 we obtain a kuro decomposition : @xmath82 where @xmath8 is free .",
    "we claim that this decomposition is exactly the decomposition of @xmath24 the theorem requires .",
    "first of all , @xmath8 will be the free component .",
    "now we examine the other components .    for every pair @xmath83 in   @xmath84",
    "lies in a double coset @xmath85 i.e.   @xmath86 then we have @xmath87 therefore @xmath88 in other words , @xmath89 is trivial unless @xmath90 and @xmath84 comes from a double coset @xmath91 , and in this case @xmath92 .",
    "so if we denote by @xmath93 the representative of @xmath91 occurring in   then the free decomposition of @xmath24 reduces to , after omitting the components which   shows trivial : @xmath94 for each @xmath17 the elements @xmath93 obviously form a set of double coset representatives and @xmath95 . since @xmath1 , there are elements @xmath96 such that @xmath97 . setting @xmath98 , we have @xmath99 and @xmath100 , hence @xmath101 moreover , the elements @xmath102 form a set of representatives of double cosets @xmath19 . for the unique @xmath103 with @xmath104 , we have @xmath105 , and we may choose @xmath106 .",
    "this implies @xmath107 and hence @xmath21 occurs in the double coset representatives ."
