    "the thermodynamics of magnetic materials is often described using the heisenberg model in which the spins are attached to lattice sites .",
    "real magnets are much more complicated , because the magnetization is due to band electrons whose degree of localization varies between different materials .",
    "this so - called _ itinerancy _ manifests itself in the fluctuation of the magnitudes of the local moments , which may be defined in a muffin tin sphere or using a projection in an appropriate basis .",
    "thus , the degree of itinerancy may be characterized by the relative importance of longitudinal and transverse ( rotational ) fluctuations of the local moments .",
    "@xcite in the localized ( heisenberg ) limit the longitudinal spin fluctuations ( lsf ) have a large energy scale and are suppressed .",
    "this limit is approached in some magnetic insulators .",
    "metals , on the other hand , are often quite far from this limit , because the exchange splitting and the bandwidth are typically of the same order . experimentally , itinerancy is most clearly revealed in the paramagnetic susceptibility by the deviation of the effective moment found from the curie - weiss constant from the true local moment , as well as by the deviations from the curie - weiss law .",
    "a large amount of work has been devoted to the thermodynamics of itinerant magnets using phenomenological ginzburg - landau models for weak ferromagnets @xcite or the hubbard model and the functional integral methods .",
    "@xcite these studies have clarified the role of lsf in thermodynamics and explained the observed behavior of the paramagnetic susceptibility . however , these methods are unsuitable for quantitative studies of realistic materials . ginzburg - landau expansions , as is well known , correctly describe only the contribution of long - wave fluctuations and must always be rigged with a wavevector cut - off .",
    "such models are useful in the studies of critical phenomena , but they are irrelevant to the determination of the critical temperature itself , which is determined by _ short - range _ fluctuations .",
    "@xcite an unsatisfactory signature of ginzburg - landau models is the absence of any information on the short - wave components of the exchange interaction in the resulting expressions for the curie temperature.@xcite in our opinion , the neglect of short - wave fluctuations in these models makes their predictions for magnetic short - range order ( msro ) also unreliable .",
    "the functional integral method , on the other hand , suffers from the necessity to make severe and ambiguous approximations.@xcite    magnetic thermodynamics has also been studied using density functional theory ( dft ) by treating spin fluctuations within the adiabatic approximation @xcite assuming that the relevant fluctuations are well represented by constrained @xcite noncollinear ground states .",
    "the most widespread approach is the disordered local moment ( dlm ) approximation @xcite which relies on the single - site approximation and is designed to approximate the dft ground state of a system with random directions of the local moments .",
    "the lsf have been neglected in all implementations of this approach so far , restricting its application to magnets which are close to the localized limit . in particular",
    ", the dlm method neglecting lsf fails for ( strongly itinerant ) nickel where it finds vanishing local moment in the paramagnetic phase.@xcite    other authors studied _ itinerant _ thermodynamics by mapping the results of first - principles energies for various spin configurations ( including both transverse and longitudinal fluctuations ) to a classical hamiltonian in which variable local moments play the role of dynamical variables , and then exploring the thermodynamics of this hamiltonian using either the variational principle in reciprocal space @xcite or monte carlo ( mc ) simulations in real space . @xcite",
    "these calculations clearly show that lsf , as expected , are very important in nickel .",
    "moreover , they revealed only weak magnetic short - range order ( msro ) above the curie temperature @xmath0 for both fe and ni , which is similar to the heisenberg model .",
    "these results are consistent with the fact that in any lattice model with no frustration all correlation corrections to the mean - field approximation ( outside of the critical region ) should be small in the parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of neighbors within the interaction range .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , very strong msro above @xmath0 was found @xcite in ni using the _ ab initio _ spin dynamics method , which , similar to dlm , is based on the adiabatic approximation and neglects lsf .",
    "classical models with variable local moments seem to capture the important qualitative features of the thermodynamics of itinerant magnets which are similar to the predictions of the functional integral method .",
    "however , these models have been built and studied only for a few particular materials , and a general study of their thermodynamic properties has not been undertaken . such a study is useful as a step to more refined models with the advantage that numerically exact results for a classical model are easily accessible through monte carlo simulations .",
    "therefore , in this paper we explore the thermodynamics of a classical spin fluctuation model as a function of the degree of itinerancy using mc simulations and simple analytic approximations .",
    "we emphasize that here we are not concerned with the `` mapping '' procedure ( which can be quite challenging ) but rather focus on the other separate part of the program , i.e. on the determination of thermodynamics once the hamiltonian has been defined .",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves to the simplest possible realization of this model which includes only _",
    "one _ free parameter characterizing the degree of itinerancy .",
    "our model is a lattice version of the phenomenological model of murata and doniach @xcite written with a vector order parameter @xcite : @xmath3-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i\\ne j}j_{ij}\\mathbf{m}_{i } \\mathbf{m}_{j}. \\label{hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath4 denotes the magnetic moment at site _",
    "i _ whose length is unrestricted , and @xmath5 the stoner exchange - correlation parameter . we have separately written the local @xmath6 and nonlocal @xmath7 parts of the unenhanced inverse susceptibility .",
    "this model involves a number of simplifying assumptions : ( 1 ) it is classical in the sense that @xmath8 are dynamical variables and not operators .",
    "( 2 ) both local and nonlocal parts of the inverse susceptibility are considered to be independent of the magnetic state and _ isotropic_. in general , @xmath9 is a cartesian tensor which depends on the magnetic state and reduces to a scalar only in the paramagnetic state .",
    "( 3 ) nonlinear effects are included only through a local fourth - order term , similar to the murata - doniach model .",
    "model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is somewhat similar to that used to represent the unified spin fluctuation theory@xcite classically ( see ref .",
    ", ch . 7 , and also ref . ) , with an important difference : the energy of lsfs is included as a function of local dynamical variables @xmath8 , rather than that of one global parameter @xmath10 .",
    "this difference is similar to that between the heisenberg model and the spherical approximation to it .    in the ground state",
    "all local moments are parallel and we recover the stoner model which is ferromagnetic if @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the density of states at the fermi level in the nonmagnetic state .",
    "this stoner criterion can also be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , in the paramagnetic or non - magnetic matrix , local moments exist in the anderson sense only if @xmath15 which is stricter than the stoner criterion .",
    "we will call this the anderson criterion .",
    "( note that @xmath16 . )    introducing reduced local moments @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the value of all @xmath19 at @xmath20 , the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can be conveniently parameterized : @xmath21 where @xmath22/j_0 $ ] with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "the energy of this state has a minimum at @xmath35 and its curvature with respect to the longitudinal fluctuation of @xmath36 is @xmath37 , while the curvature with respect to transverse fluctuations is @xmath38 .",
    "their ratio @xmath39 characterizes the relative importance of longitudinal and transverse fluctuations .",
    "if @xmath40 , the fluctuations are mainly transverse , and we have the localized ( heisenberg ) limit for which @xmath41 and @xmath42 . if @xmath43 , the transverse and longitudinal spin fluctuations are equally important ; this limit corresponds to @xmath44 .",
    "the anderson criterion is equivalent to @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath30 characterizes the degree of itinerancy and is similar to those appearing in other theories @xcite .",
    "note that we always have @xmath46 , even though the _ macroscopic _ longitudinal stiffness is proportional to @xmath47 and tends to zero at @xmath48 .",
    "evaluation of the thermodynamic properties involves taking a trace over the quantum states , or a functional integral over the classical degrees of freedom . to our knowledge , in all classical models reported so far and based on _ ab initio _ calculations , the uniform measure in the space of @xmath8 was used .",
    "@xcite however , our dynamical variables are not canonical , and therefore the phase space measure ( psm ) is not known . in the case when lsf are important , the psm has to be supplied along with the hamiltonian as an additional phenomenological ingredient . strictly speaking",
    ", it is not possible to disentangle the measure from quantum statistics ; for example , in the atomic limit only integer moments with atomic multiplet degeneracies should be present .",
    "ambiguity of psm is intrinsic to all microscopic classical spin fluctuation models including the classical version of the `` unified theory '' of moriya and takahashi ( ref .",
    ", sec . 7 ) and its extensions , @xcite as well as the functional integral approach combined with the static approximation which destroys the correct quantum operator properties . in the latter case , the hubbard - stratonovich transformation can be applied with the interaction term written in different ways , which produce different results after the static approximation is made .",
    "@xcite two particular choices discussed by hubbard @xcite result in different measures in the space of fluctuating fields @xmath49 : uniform in one case , and involving the weighting factor @xmath50 in another . to explore the influence of psm on thermodynamics",

    "<S> thermodynamics of itinerant magnets is studied using a classical model with one parameter characterizing the degree of itinerancy . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo simulations for bcc and fcc lattices are compared with the mean - field approximation and with the onsager cavity field approximation extended to itinerant systems . </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative features of thermodynamics are similar to the known results of the functional integral method . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that magnetic short - range order is weak and almost independent on the degree of itinerancy , and the mean - field approximation describes the thermodynamics reasonably well . </S>",
    "<S> ambiguity of the phase space measure for classical models is emphasized . </S>",
    "<S> the onsager cavity field method is extended to itinerant systems , which involves the renormalization of both the weiss field and the on - site exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of this approximation are in excellent agreement with monte carlo results . </S>"
