    "in this paper , we will prove the following theorem :    [ thm : main ]    let @xmath3 be convex bodies containing the origin as an interior point such that for every @xmath4 , the projection @xmath5 can be rotated about the origin into @xmath6 .",

    "several related results have been proven under various assumptions about the type of congruence the projections satisfy .",

    "this new result differs in that no symmetry assumptions are made about the bodies , but the freedom to translate projections is lost .",
    "throughout this paper , @xmath8 will refer to the @xmath9-dimensional euclidean space , and @xmath10 will denote the unit sphere .",
    "the euclidean inner product of two vectors @xmath11 will be denoted by @xmath12 for a unit vector @xmath13 , the hyperplane orthogonal to @xmath14 is denoted by @xmath15 .",

    "if @xmath17 is a convex body containing the origin and @xmath4 , the section of @xmath1 orthogonal to @xmath14 is the set @xmath18 . given @xmath19",
    "endowed with the spherical metric , the interior of @xmath20 will be denoted by @xmath21 and the closure of @xmath20 will be denoted by @xmath22 .",

    "our strategy in this section will be to combine information about the original bodies and the corresponding dual bodies to reduce the problem to a statement about a system of equations . solving this system",
    "will then reduce further to solving a quartic polynomial equation in one variable . using this",
    ", we will see that any projection which can be rotated by an amount between 0 and @xmath47 into the other projection must be a disk .",
    "what this shows is that there actually are no rotations except for the zero rotation and a reflection about the origin .",
    "we will prove a lemma analogous to lemma [ lem : gol ] which is concerned with the dual bodies @xmath103 and @xmath104 of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the key is that duality takes projections into sections : @xmath105 for any @xmath4 ( @xcite page 22 ) .",
    "this is used in the proof of the following lemma which shows that rotational congruence is inherited by sections of the dual bodies .      if @xmath75 , let @xmath109 be the rotation of @xmath110 about the origin by @xmath111 since @xmath112 is a 1 - 1 linear transformation such that @xmath113 , we have @xmath114 .",

    "define the function @xmath118 by @xmath119 , and define @xmath120 similarly .",
    "lemma [ lem : gol ] is a statement about projections and the width function of @xmath1 , whereas he function @xmath121 contains information about the sections of @xmath103 .",
    "we can define the set @xmath122 analogously to @xmath85 by @xmath123 restricted to @xmath124 is constant@xmath125 observe that if @xmath126 since the radial function measures distance from the origin , it follows from lemma [ lem : rotation sections ] that @xmath127 for every @xmath128      since all sections of @xmath103 are congruent to corresponding sections of @xmath104 , @xmath130 for every unit vector @xmath131 since the area of the section can be expressed as @xmath132 we can conclude      @xmath134 for all unit vectors @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the spherical radon transform of the even function @xmath135 is identically zero on @xmath31 , and so ( @xcite page 430 ) implies that @xmath121 and @xmath120 coincide everywhere .",
    "the proof of this lemma closely resembles golubyatnikov s proof starting on page 17 of @xcite , and will be postponed until the end of the paper .",
    "if we assume that this lemma has been proven , we can complete the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] . from lemma [ lem : mod gol ] and lemma [ lem : gol ] , we know that if @xmath4 is not in @xmath137 , then it must be that @xmath138 .",
    "the main idea is to use duality to show that if @xmath138 , then @xmath139 , and therefore @xmath140 .",
    "golubyatnikov has proven that this then implies that @xmath141 or @xmath54 ( @xcite page 22 ) , which completes the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "all that remains is to prove the following corollary .      by lemma [ lem : gol ] and lemma [ lem : mod gol ] , @xmath143",
    "is contained in @xmath144 , so it suffices to prove that @xmath144 is a subset of @xmath137 . if @xmath145 lemma [ lem : gol ] implies that there exists a constant @xmath146 so that for all @xmath59 , @xmath147 by lemma [ lem : mod gol ] , there is a constant @xmath148 so that for all @xmath59 , @xmath149 since @xmath150 for any unit vector @xmath151 ( @xcite page 20 ) , the second equation can be rewritten as @xmath152 for all @xmath59 .",
    "consider the system of equations @xmath153 and @xmath154 since the origin is an interior point of @xmath1 , we can assume that neither @xmath26 nor @xmath155 is equal to zero , and thus this system can be expressed as the quartic equation @xmath156 which has at most four real valued solutions in @xmath26 .",
    "for each @xmath157 @xmath158 is a solution to this equation .",
    "since @xmath68 is a continuous function of @xmath159 the intermediate value theorem implies that @xmath68 is constant on @xmath160 this implies that both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are disks , and thus @xmath161 it follows that @xmath162 and therefore @xmath163 .        to prove the lemma",
    ", we will show that the set @xmath164 is empty . an argument similar to the proof of lemma [ lem : sigma ]",
    "( just replace @xmath38 with @xmath121 ) shows that @xmath165 is closed , so it follows from lemma [ lem : closed ] and lemma [ lem : rotation sections ] that @xmath166 is an open set .",
    "suppose there is a unit vector @xmath167 such that @xmath75 for some irrational @xmath168 .",
    "by lemma [ lem : rotation sections ] and lemma [ lem : tau ] , we can conclude that for every @xmath169 , @xmath170 fixing some @xmath171 , an inductive argument shows that @xmath172 since @xmath24 is irrational , the set @xmath173 is dense in the circle @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath121 is continuous on @xmath31 , and it takes on a single value on a dense subset of @xmath16 , so it follows that @xmath121 takes a single value on @xmath16 .",
    "therefore @xmath174 is a disk , and thus so is @xmath175 , which contradicts the assumption that @xmath176    if @xmath166 is nonempty and none of the sections orthogonal to elements of @xmath166 coincide after some irrational angle , then @xmath166 can be rewritten as @xmath177 for some subset of the rational numbers contained in @xmath178 .",
    "we claim that there exists some rational @xmath179 with @xmath180 .",
    "to see this , since @xmath166 is open and assumed nonempty , there exists @xmath181 and @xmath95 with @xmath182 .",
    "then @xmath183 , and lemma [ lem : baire ] implies there exists some rational @xmath179 with @xmath184 .",
    "fix some @xmath14 and @xmath95 with the spherical disk @xmath32 contained in @xmath185 then the continuous function @xmath121 is not constant along @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , infinitely many values @xmath186 exist with corresponding unit vectors @xmath187 so that @xmath188 the rest of the proof will be spent using these values to construct marks on the sphere which are geometrically impossible .    for each value @xmath189 for some @xmath187 , denote by @xmath190 the vector obtained by rotating @xmath191 by @xmath192 along @xmath193 we claim there is an open arc @xmath194 containing @xmath190 with @xmath121 identically equal to @xmath186 on @xmath195 .",
    "we will then construct another arc @xmath196 on @xmath31 which intersects @xmath195 at @xmath190 on which @xmath121 is also constant , and we will define @xmath197 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "since the spherical disk @xmath32 is contained in @xmath198 and @xmath199 , there exists an open arc @xmath200 centered at @xmath14 and contained in @xmath201 . for any @xmath202",
    ", @xmath203 is orthogonal to @xmath191 , and so @xmath204 , which implies that the great circle @xmath205 intersects @xmath206 at the point @xmath207 call @xmath208 .",

    "if we start at @xmath190 and rotate the projections of @xmath104 in the reverse direction , by a similar argument applied to @xmath104 we can create @xmath213 and an open arc @xmath214 so that @xmath121 takes only the value @xmath186 on @xmath215 .",
    "next , we can pick a third unit vector @xmath216 distinct from @xmath191 , and consider the circle @xmath217 . using an similar argument",
