    "@xmath23 is the state space for the system that alice and bob share , with orthonormal basis @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where the latter form for basis elements ( letting order distinguish alice and bob s kets ) will be used for notational convenience .    in the deterministic dense - coding protocol , originated by bennett and wiesner @xcite , alice prepares messages for bob by applying to her qudit a physical operation actualizing a unitary operator ( on @xmath18 ) chosen from a family @xmath26 of _ encoding unitaries _ , and then she sends her qudit to bob via a noiseless @xmath27-dimensional quantum channel .",
    "when bob receives alice s qudit , he measures the pair in an appropriate basis , obtaining a message . in order that the messages alice sends be perfectly distinguishable by bob , the states @xmath28 must be ( pairwise ) orthogonal in the hilbert space @xmath23 .",

    "the truth of this conjecture is a consequence of the following result due to wu , cohen , sun , and griffiths @xcite :    suppose that alice and bob share a two - qudit entangled state @xmath1 with maximum schmidt coefficient @xmath9 .",

    "if @xmath1 permits alice to send @xmath8 messages to bob via deterministic dense coding , then @xmath41    the work of @xcite suggests that the upper bounds on @xmath42 provided by inequality ( [ wi ] ) can not be decreased when @xmath43 , but that for @xmath12 , the bound should instead be the smaller value @xmath44 .    additional analytic work , supporting the validity of the numerical results in @xcite , is provided by ji _",

    "@xcite , who have proved that when @xmath1 is non - maximally entangled the greatest number of messages that @xmath1 can support is @xmath45 . also , @xcite itself contains explicit constructions of some families of encoding unitaries that are consistent with numerical data .",
    "for example , the state @xmath46 is shown to support the sending of @xmath47 messages and @xmath48 is shown to support the sending of @xmath49 messages .",
    "numerical work in @xcite suggests that the state ( [ dpo ] ) is the state with minimal entanglement entropy ( and largest @xmath42 value ) that supports the sending of @xmath47 messages and that the state ( [ oh ] ) is the state with minimal entanglement entropy ( and largest @xmath42 value ) that supports the sending of @xmath49 messages .",
    "more generally , based on their numerical work , mozes _",
    "et al _ @xcite conjecture the following :    [ mc ] the state ( of a two qudit system ) with minimal entanglement entropy supporting the sending of @xmath50 messages , @xmath51 , is @xmath52    for a fixed value of @xmath53 , it is easy to check that the entanglement entropy ( [ es ] ) of a system in state ( [ gqds ] ) is minimized when @xmath54 ( and @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , the entanglement entropy of @xmath56 decreases as @xmath42 increases ( @xmath53 ) .",

    "@xcite ) and @xmath69 , which is the largest bound of interest in that it provides information about where the transition from what is possible without entanglement ( sending @xmath27 messages with a qudit ) to what is possible with entanglement ( sending more than @xmath27 messages with a qudit ) .",
    "this paper s principal contributions to deterministic dense - coding theory include the following :    *  ii : we present an alternate proof of the validity of the wcsg bounds , which provides useful information about any family of @xmath8 encoding unitaries for @xmath1 ( of form ( [ gqds ] ) ) , given that @xmath1 supports @xmath8 fully distinguishable messages and @xmath63 .",
    "this `` boundary information '' is recorded as corollary  [ kc ] . using corollary  [ kc ] ,",
    "we prove that the wcsg bound @xmath70 is not saturated . *  iii : we prove that there are two - qutrit systems with states @xmath71 and @xmath72 for which the entanglement entropy of the first is lower than that of the second , yet the first supports the sending of a greater number of perfectly distinguishable messages than the second .",
    "this outcome , somewhat counterintuitive , was strongly suggested by numerical work of mozes _ et al .",
    "the authors of @xcite attribute this possibility to the fact that the von neumann entropy is an asymptotic quantity whereas the deterministic dense coding process can be carried out with a single entangled pair .",
    "of course , it is the vector of schmidt coefficients of the bipartite - system state @xmath73 that ultimately determines the number of dense - coding messages @xmath1 will support , and in general this vector is not determined by @xmath38 . *",
    " iii &  iv : we establish that conjecture m is valid in dimensions @xmath74 and @xmath3 via explicit construction of families of encoding unitaries .",
    "we also prove a non - extendibility result for certain families of encoding unitaries constructed using powers of the @xmath27-dimensional ( unitary ) shift operator @xmath75 , defined by @xmath76 we show that if @xmath77 is any collection of unitary diagonal operators , then the collection @xmath78 , which may serve as a collection of encoding unitaries for any two - qudit state @xmath1 , can not be extended to be a part of a larger family of encoding unitaries for @xmath1 if @xmath79 .",
