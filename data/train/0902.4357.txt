    "photonics appears destined for a central role owing to the wide compatibility , low - noise and high - speed transmission properties of photons @xcite",
    ". however , future quantum technologies and fundamental science will require integrated optical circuits that offer high - fidelity and stability whilst enabling scalability . silica - on - silicon waveguide photonic quantum circuits @xcite are an important step , however , conventional lithography is costly , time consuming , and limited to two - dimensions .",
    "here we demonstrate an alternative fabrication technique based on ultrafast laser processing @xcite that overcomes all of these issues .",
    "quantum technologies rely on transmitting and processing information encoded in physical systems  typically two - state _ qubits_exhibiting uniquely quantum mechanical properties @xcite .",
    "photons hold great promise as qubits given their light - speed transmission , ease of manipulation at the single qubit level , low noise ( or _ decoherence _ ) properties and the multiple degrees of freedom available for encoding qubits or higher - level systems ( including polarization , optical mode , path and time - bin ) .",
    "the problem of realizing interactions between single photonic qubits was theoretically solved in a breakthrough scheme for implementing optical non - linear interactions using only single photon sources , linear optical elements and single photon detectors @xcite .",
    "remarkable progress in the development of single photon sources @xcite and detectors @xcite , make a photonic approach to quantum technologies very promising . indeed , there have been a number of important proof - of - principal demonstrations of quantum optical circuits for communication @xcite , computing @xcite , metrology @xcite , and lithography @xcite .",
    "however , the use of large - scale ( bulk ) optics to create these circuits places extremely stringent requirements on the alignment and stability in position of the optical components , thus making such an approach inherently unscalable . successful operation of a quantum optical circuit requires that the individual photons be brought together at precisely the same position and with the correct phase on a succession of optical components in order to realize the high - fidelity classical and quantum interference that lies at the heart of single photon interactions @xcite .",
    "integrated optical quantum circuits based on chip - scale waveguide networks will likely find important applications in future quantum information science along side optical fibre photonic quantum circuits that have been demonstrated in quantum key distribution @xcite and quantum logic gate applications @xcite .",
    "ultrafast lasers are a powerful tool not only for machining @xcite but also for the subtle optical modification of materials .",
    "in particular , the direct - write femtosecond laser technique for creating optical waveguides in dielectric media @xcite is an alternative waveguide manufacturing technique that allows the production of low - volume complex three - dimensional optical _ circuits _ ( fig .  [ schematic](a ) ) .",
    "this process has been applied to a wide range of passive and active media to create integrated devices such as microfluidic sensors @xcite , waveguide - bragg gratings @xcite and miniature lasers @xcite . because there is no lithography step in this procedure it enables a waveguide circuit to be taken rapidly from concept to a completed device . however , as with all waveguide fabrication processes , the devices are subject to manufacturing imperfections and there has been no previous demonstration that the use of the laser - writing technique can produce waveguides that can operate on single photons without deleterious effects on phase , spatial mode or polarization . in this paper",
    "we report the first application of laser written waveguide circuits to photonic quantum technologies and , using single- and multi - photon interference experiments , we show that such circuits perform as well as lithographically fabricated devices and are an ideal platform for scalable quantum information science .",
    "in conventional lithographically fabricated integrated optical devices , light is guided in waveguides consisting of a core and a slightly lower refractive - index cladding or buffer layers ( in a manner analogous to an optical fibre ) . in the commonly used flame hydrolysis deposition ( fhd )",
    "fabrication method these structures are lithographically described on top of a semiconductor wafer @xcite . by careful choice of core and cladding dimensions and refractive index difference it is possible to design such waveguides to support only a single transverse mode for a given wavelength range .",
    "coupling between waveguides , to realize beamsplitter - like operation , can be achieved when two waveguides are brought sufficiently close together that the evanescent fields overlap ; this architecture is known as the directional coupler . by carefully selecting the separation between the waveguides and the length of the interaction region the amount of light coupled from one waveguide into the other ( the coupling ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is equivalent to beamsplitter reflectivity ) and its dependance on wavelength can be tuned .",
    "a similar approach can be taken in the case of directly written waveguides , where the waveguide core is formed by local modification of silica @xcite ( or other materials ) . however , unlike the lithographic approach , direct - write circuits can be straightforwardly written in 3d .",
    "we fabricated two chips with a number of direct - write quantum circuits ( dwqcs ) composed of 2@xmath22 directional couplers ( fig .",
    "[ schematic](c ) ) and mach - zehnder interferometers .",
    "the circuits were written inside high purity fused silica using a tightly focused 1  khz repetition rate , 800  nm , 120  fs laser and motion control system similar to that previously reported @xcite .",
    "the writing laser beam was circularly polarised and passed through a 520 @xmath3 m slit before being focused 170  @xmath3 m below the surface of the glass using a 40@xmath2 0.6 numerical aperture microscope objective that was corrected for spherical aberrations at this depth ( fig .",

    "the design of the directional couplers was functionally identical except for the length of the central interaction region that was varied from 400 to 2000  @xmath3 m to achieve different coupling ratios .",
    "the curved regions of the waveguides were of raised - sine form and connected the input and output waveguide pitch of 250  @xmath3 m down to the closely spaced evanescent coupling region of the devices .",
    "the mach - zehnder interferometers design comprised two 50:50 directional couplers separated by identical 1500  @xmath3 m long arms .",

    "the photon pairs were passed through 2  nm bandpass interference filters to improve indistinguishability before being coupled into two polarization maintaining single mode optical fibres ( pmfs ) .",
    "the path length difference could be varied with the @xmath3 m actuator which adjusted the arrival time of the photons with respect to each other at the waveguide chip .",
    "photons were collected from the chip in single mode fibres ( smfs ) and coupled to avalanche photo diodes ( apds ) which were in turn connected to a photon counting and coincidence logic circuit .",
    "index matching oil was used between the fibres and the device under test to reduce fresnel reflections that contribute to coupling losses .",
    "the circuit devices had typical transmission efficiencies of 50% ( which includes coupling and propagation losses ) . in the case of an ideal @xmath7 directional coupler , if two non - degenerate ( _ i.e. _ entirely distinguishable ) photons are coupled into waveguides @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( fig .",

    "more generally the visibility of the hom dip is also limited by other degrees of freedom including polarization , frequency , spatial mode , and beam coupling ratio ( or reflectivity ) of the directional coupler .",
    "while the reflectivity parameter is inherent to the optical circuitry , the remaining degrees of freedom can be attributed to both the source of photons and individual manipulation of these parameters within the circuit .    considering the device separately to the source of photons , the _ ideal _ hom dip visibility ,",
    "@xmath13 , is a function of the equivalent beamsplitter reflectivity @xmath1 : @xmath14 which is a maximum for @xmath7 .",
    "imperfections in the waveguides that perturb the state of a photon in any degree of freedom will degrade the degeneracy of the photon pairs and reduce the measured @xmath15 below @xmath16 . assuming a spdc source prepares identical photon pairs the relative visibility @xmath17 of the hom dip provides the operational fidelity of a directional coupler and thus @xmath18 is the key quantifier of the performance of a photonic quantum circuit in preserving photon degeneracy . in this work",
    "we have not corrected for imperfections in either the sources degeneracies or the measurement setups , hence our measurements of @xmath18 are lower bounds for the fidelities of the devices .",
    "in addition to high - fidelity quantum interference ( as quantified by @xmath18 ) , quantum circuits require high - visibility , stable classical interference . using the 2-photon spdc source as a convenient source of 804  nm photons we measured the effective reflectivity of the mach - zehnder interferometers by blocking one arm of the spdc source to input one photon at a time into the arms of the interferometer . in the case of an ideal null - phase difference interferometer with 50:50 beam splitters",

    "when two photons are input into @xmath8 and one in @xmath9 an ideal @xmath21 reflectivity coupler will generate the three - photon entangled state : @xmath22 term .",
    "an analogue of the hom dip can therefore be observed by measuring the rate of detecting two photons in c and one in d as a function of the delay time between the photon in @xmath9 and the two photons in @xmath8 @xcite . to observe a @xmath23 hom dip , as described by eq .",

    "dwqcs overcome many of the limitations of standard lithographic approaches : while the devices described here were written in 2d , extension to a 3d architecture is straightforward ; single devices can be made with short turnaround for rapid prototyping ; and the direct - write technique easily produces devices with circular mode profiles , the size and elipticity of which can be adjusted by changing the laser focusing conditions . this ability to tailor the guided mode will enable production of waveguides that better match fibre modes and reduce photon losses , and could be combined with the ongoing development of waveguide @xcite or fibre @xcite based photon sources .",
    "fabrication of sophisticated integrated quantum photonic circuits can now be achieved with only an ultrafast laser system rather than state - of - the - art semiconductor processing facilities .",
    "quantum circuits for photons , regardless of their application , comprise multi - path and multi - photon interferometers involving generalized quantum interference at a beam splitter ( or directional coupler ) .",
    "high visibility interference such as that demonstrated here is therefore crucial to realizing future quantum technologies and the next generation of fundamental quantum optics experiments .",
