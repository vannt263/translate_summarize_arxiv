    "while the principle science goal of the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) has been the study of star formation in the local and intermediate redshift universe , nearby galaxies such as m31 have also been surveyed , taking advantage of the wide ( 1.2 deg ) field of view of _",
    "galex_. since launch in april 2003 , we have been able to image 23 fields near and coincident with m31 , now covering nearly all of m31 and its environs .",
    "our first investigation of m31 globular clusters ( gcs ) using _ galex _ was reported in rey et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the dataset we report on here includes analysis of the coadded images , the wider field , and matching with optical / infrared datasets . while deeper observations of specific regions in m31 will likely occur in the next few years , it is unlikely that the combination of areal coverage and depth will be dramatically superseded by any _ galex _ observations in the next few years .",
    "gcs , as aggregates of coeval stars with small internal dispersion in chemical abundance , are the best examples of simple stellar populations and ideal templates for studying the evolution of stellar populations .",
    "observations of gcs offer the means of clarifying fundamental parameters in various astrophysical processes . at present , gcs are being used to constrain the connection between gc systems and their host galaxies , since they provide tracers of the star formation histories of galaxies in the sense that major star formations in galaxies are concomitant with global gc formation ( brodie & strader 2006 ) . in this respect ,",
    "relative ages of gcs within a galaxy or between different galaxies are crucial for understanding the time scale for galaxy formation and subsequent chemical evolution .",
    "the most direct way of measuring age differences among different stellar populations is to compare the observed luminosity levels of the main - sequence turnoffs ( mstos ) ; for a given metallicity an intrinsically fainter msto translates to older ages .",
    "unfortunately this method is limited to the nearest gcs , where individual stars can be resolved and measured well to two magnitudes fainter than the msto . even in the nearest massive spiral galaxy , m31 ,",
    "the msto has been reached for only one cluster ( g312=b379 ) and that only after @xmath6 days of @xmath7 acs integration time ( brown et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "alternatively , ages can be estimated from the horizontal - branch ( hb ) morphologies of gcs . for a sufficiently old ( @xmath8 8 gyr ) stellar population , the surface temperature distribution of hb stars is sensitive to age ( lee , demarque , & zinn 1994 ; yi 2003 ) . despite uncertainties of the details regarding peculiar hb morphologies in some galactic gcs ( e.g. , bimodal hb distribution and extreme hb stars ) , various studies have suggested that together with metallicity , cluster age is the major parameter controlling the hb morphology ( lee et al .",
    "1994 ; sarajedini , chaboyer , & demarque 1997 ; rey et al . 2001 ; salaris & weiss 2002 ) .",
    "the hot he - burning hb stars and their progenies are most likely the dominant ultraviolet ( uv ) sources in the nearest old stellar populations ( oconnell 1999 ; brown 2004 ) .",
    "the integrated far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) flux depends mainly on the fractional number of hb stars with @xmath9 hotter than @xmath10 k , with a modest dependence on their temperature distribution . the production rate of these hot hb stars increases with age . as a result , older gcs are likely to produce stronger fuv flux at a given metallicity ( park & lee 1997 ; yi et al .",
    "1999 ; lee , lee , & gibson 2002 ) . in this respect , integrated fuv flux can act as an age indicator of gcs ( see also dorman et al .",
    "1995 , 2003 ; yi 2003 ; catelan 2005 ; kaviraj et al .",
    "furthermore , this allows us to investigate mean age distributions of gcs within a single galaxy or among different galaxies , provided that other minor sources of fuv flux ( e.g. , existence of extreme hb stars due to the helium variation among stellar population in a gc ; lee et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) can be quantified .",
    "the m31 gc system ( gcs ) is one of the most ideal targets for integrated uv photometry due to its proximity ( 770 kpc ; freedman & madore 1990 ) and populous gcs ( more than 300 confirmed gcs ; galleti et al .",
    "catalogs of m31 gcs are compiled from various imaging observations ( battistini et al . 1980 , 1987 , 1993 ; crampton et al .",
    "1985 ; reed , harris , & harris 1994 ; barmby et al .",
    "2000 ; galleti et al .",
    "in addition , many optical spectroscopic observations provide chemical and kinematical properties of m31 gcs ( huchra , stauffer , & van speybroeck 1982 ; kent , huchra , & stauffer 1989 ; huchra , brodie , & kent 1991 ; brodie & huchra 1991 ; barmby et al . 2000 ; perrett et al .",
    "there also have been color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) studies of a few m31 gcs using data obtained by _",
    "( ajhar et al . 1996 ; fusi pecci et al . 1996 ;",
    "rich et al . 1996 , 2005 ; holland , fahlman , & richer 1997 ; jablonka et al .",
    "2000 ; stephens et al . 2001 ) .",
    "all of these studies suggest that the m31 gcs is very similar to that of the milky way in many ways .",
    "therefore , the m31 gcs are a kind of bridge between resolved and unresolved stellar populations , making these clusters a critical set of template populations .",
    "on the other hand , there has been growing body of evidence that the gcs of the milky way and of m31 , the two large spirals in the local group , have very different properties and evolutionary histories ( c.f .",
    "rich 2004 ) .",
    "in contrast to the case of the miky way halo gcs with uniformly very old ( 10  12 gyr ) ages , there have been suggestions that the age distribution of m31 gcs is wide .",
    "there is a large population of young clusters with ages less than 1  2 gyr and intermediate - age gcs with @xmath5 5  8 gyr ( burstein et al .",

    "2004 , 2005 ; fusi pecci et al . 2005 ;",
    "puzia , perrett , & bridges 2005 ) are found in m31 .",
    "furthermore , m31 possesses a kinematically distinct group of gcs that follows the disk rotation curve of m31 ( morrison et al .",
    "2004 ) , whereas no such counterparts have yet been discovered in milky way .",
    "finally , the nitrogen abundance of the m31 gcs appears to be enhanced relative to that of the milky way gcs ( burstein et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "to what degree do the gcss of m31 and the milky way share similarities ?",
    "this question can be answered by taking an approach different from previous studies , i.e. using uv photometry which is sensitive to age .",
    "so far , there has been no systematic uv survey for a large and representative sample of gcs in galaxies , where detailed information on their optical and near - infrared photometry are available .",
    "while there are some uv imaging studies of galactic gcs from satellites such as the _ orbiting astronomical observatory ( oao2 ) _ , the _ astronomical netherlands satellite ( ans ) _ , and the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) _ ( dorman , oconnell , & rood 1995 and references therein ) , very little have been carried out for m31 gcs . using the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ , cacciari et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and cowley & burstein ( 1988 ) obtained the first spectra of a dozen brightest clusters in m31 at low resolution . from rocket - borne uv imaging telescopes , near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) and fuv fluxes were determined for 17 cluster candidates in m31 ( bohlin et al .",
    "@xmath11 observations of m31 detected 43 gcs in nuv but only 4 clusters in the fuv ( bohlin et al .",
    "these studies show that the gcs of m31 and milky way cover a similar range of uv@xmath4 colors . based on their uv results , bohlin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) suggest that the ages of m31 gcs are as old as the galactic gcs .",
    "however , because the uv sample size of m31 gcs detected from @xmath11 is insufficient , especially in fuv which is more sensitive to the age of old stellar populations , the conclusion by bohlin et al . can not be taken as definitive .",
    "thanks to the successful launch and operation of _ galex _ , the situation for uv studies of stellar clusters in nearby galaxies has dramatically changed . using the unprecedented set of @xmath12 photometry of m31 coupled with most recent detailed population models",
    ", we are now able to study the global uv characteristics of m31 gcs , and compare them to milky way gcs . using uv images obtained as part of the",
    " _ galex _ ultraviolet survey of globular clusters in nearby galaxies \" project , we present the catalog of _ galex _ uv photometry of m31 .",
    "this catalog is much more homogeneous than the milky way uv sample which was collected from several different uv satellites with heterogeneous selection criteria .",
    "unfortunately , _",
    "galex _ can not study a large fraction of milky way and magellanic clusters because of bright star avoidance restrictions . in this study",
    ", we focus on the interpretating the uv photometry of m31 gcs , combining existing optical photometry and corollary data from which we obtain insight into age distributions compared to the galactic counterparts . in paper i , we presented our first analysis of _ galex _ photometry of m31 gcs ; this study concluded that the uv photometry of the older m31 gc is consistent with no age difference between m31 and the milky way .",

    ", we discuss the intermediate - age gcs with 4  7 gyr identified by spectroscopic observations .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section 7 .",
    "the m31 images were obtained as part of the nearby galaxy survey ( ngs ) carried out by @xmath12 in two uv bands : fuv ( 1350  1750 ) and nuv ( 1750  2750 ) .",
    "the data used in this study consist of images of 23 different 1.25 deg circular fields .",
    "details on the early observations of 14 fields released under the _ galex release 1 ( gr1 ) _ can be found in thilker et al .",
    "( 2005a ) and paper i. in the interests of increasing both spatial coverage and depth around the m31 field , we have observed an additional nine @xmath12 fields in september ",
    "november , 2004 , which are included in the _ galex release 2 ( gr2)_. our strategy for designing the pointings is to cover as wide area as possible around m31 , but this was limited by the observing requirements of avoiding extremely uv - bright foreground stars .",
    "the resulting coordinates and exposure times of the nine fields are listed in table 1 , and figure 1 shows the field coverage of each @xmath12 pointing around m31 projected onto 6@xmath146   dss images .",
    "our entire survey coverage of the 23 images is @xmath15 square deg .",
    "photon count maps from single visits were co - added to produce the final image for each field .",

    ", point sources within 0.1 deg of the edge appear distorted due to the optics . by examining each image",
    ", we decided to only use the inner 1.1 deg field , and pixels outside of this range were masked out prior to doing photometry .",
    "photometry of point sources in the m31 fields were carried out using the daophot ii package ( stetson 1987 ) . for consistency ,",
    "we have redone photometry for the 14 fields used in paper i , although we later found that the new photometry is completely consistent with the old results within our errors .",
    "the standard find - photometry - pickpsf - psf - allstar routine was applied to each image .",
    "we then reran the photometry routine , this time taking outputs from the allstar program as inputs to ensure that the center of each source is better determined .",
    "visual inspection shows that with this method , centering is much better than solely running the photometry routine , especially for sources in crowded regions .",
    "the photometry routine was used to measure fluxes within a radius of 3 pixel ( 45 ) for each point source in both fuv and nuv images .",
    "aperture corrections were derived using 19  44 ( 5  16 ) isolated stars per frame in nuv ( fuv ) .",
    "mean aperture corrections for the entire data set are @xmath16 and @xmath17 in nuv and fuv , respectively , where errors are standard deviations for the distribution of aperture correction .",

    "the uv - detected m31 clusters essentially cover the entire @xmath24-band luminosity range present in the uv - detected sample of milky way gcs .",
    "the most distinct feature of fig .",
    "4 is that m31 clusters can be divided into two subgroups based on their uv@xmath4 colors ; uv - red gcs with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and uv - blue gcs with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the red subgroup of m31 clusters and milky way gcs generally occupy the same area in the cmds . also , most m31 clusters that belong to the red subgroup have uv@xmath4 colors [ @xmath35 ; @xmath36 consistent with theoretically - predicted colors of the uv bright clusters with blue hb morphology ( see section 4 ) .",
    "m31 clusters with @xmath37 are likely to have redder hb morphologies and relatively faint uv luminosities .",
    "the blue subgroup of m31 clusters is significantly bluer than the milky way gcs . among their @xmath11 sample , bohlin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) also reported clusters much bluer than milky way gcs in the nuv .",
    "they suggest that these clusters are significantly younger than typical gcs of @xmath38 ( see also burstein et al . 1984 ; bohlin et al . 1988 ; cowley & burstein 1988 ) .",
    "many blue clusters included in our catalog have colors consistent with those [ @xmath39 of younger clusters suggested by bohlin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , while no galactic counterparts are found .",
    "most of them show stronger fractional uv flux than those of old red gcs , which is suggestive of young ages .",
    "we discuss the details of these clusters in section 5 .",
    "various studies suggest that uv@xmath2optical colors can be an age - dating tool for old stellar systems ( lee et al .",
    "2002 ; yi 2003 ; paper i ; catelan 2005 ) .",
    "specifically , lee et al . ( 2002 ) and yi ( 2003 ) show that fuv@xmath4 color can be more sensitive to ages than any optical - band integrated color . while the strength of fuv flux depends on the fractional number of hot hb stars , such stars contribute to little light to the optical bands , that are instead dominated by ms and giant stars ( dorman et al .",
    "1995 ) . at a given metallicity",
    ", older populations with bluer hb stars should be relatively uv bright , especially in the fuv passband .",
    "thus , the fuv@xmath4 color can be a measure of the age variation based on the fraction of the stellar population that appears to be hot hb stars .",
    "figure 5 shows the [ fe / h ] vs. uv@xmath4 diagrams for m31 clusters ( _ circles _ ) and galactic gcs ( _ crosses _ ) , as an analog of the [ fe / h ] vs. hb type diagram of gcs ( lee et al . 1994 ; as such , bluer colors are now on the right ) .",
    "we restrict the m31 sample to the supposedly old , red clusters with e(@xmath20 ) @xmath13 0.16 .",
    "the [ fe / h ] values for m31 is taken from table 2 , while for the galactic gcs , we adopt the february 2003 version of harris ( 1996 ) catalog . while the m31 clusters extend over a wide range of @xmath40 color comparable to that of galactic gcs ,",
    "the fuv sample is biased to the blue and metal - poor gcs with no redder [ @xmath41 clusters due to their instrinsically faint fuv brightnesses .",
    "the model isochrones in fig .",
    "5 are constructed from our evolutionary population models of gcs in the @xmath12 filter system ( chung , yoon , & lee 2006 , in preparation ; see also lee et al .",
    "2002 ; yi 2003 ) .",
    "the models include the treatment of the detailed systematic variation of hb morphology with age and metallicity and the fractional contribution of post - asymptotic giant - branch stars . the @xmath42 = 0 ( _ solid line _ )",
    "isochrone corresponds to inner halo galactic gcs ( galactocentric radius @xmath43 8 kpc ) of @xmath44 gyr .",
    "the @xmath42 = + 2 gyr ( _ long dashed line _ ) and @xmath45 gyr ( _ dotted line _ ) isochrones are for the models 2 gyr older and younger than the inner halo galactic gcs , respectively .    for a given age , hb morphology gets bluer with decreasing metallicity and the population models produce increasing uv flux . as shown in the left panel of fig . 5 , m31 and galactic gcs follow the general trend indicated by the isochrones .",
    "at a fixed metal abundance , the models exhibit rapid blueing of fuv@xmath4 colors as the age increases . the large separation among isochrones with different ages ( see right panel of fig .",
    "5 ) confirms that fuv@xmath4 color is more sensitive to ages than any optical - band integrated color .",
    "the nuv@xmath4 is relatively insensitive to age compared to fuv@xmath4 for old ( @xmath46 8 gyr ) gcs .",
    "this is because not only hb stars but also msto stars are responsible for producing integrated nuv flux ( lee et al . 2002 ; dorman et al .",
    "the model isochrones fit well the range in color of the gcs and their general locus on the age - metallicity plot . in the right panel of fig . 5 , m31 and galactic gcs",
    "are well located in the age range ( @xmath47 gyr ) of model predictions and show no significant difference in age distribution between the two gcss .",
    "this indicates that m31 and milky way gcss share similarities in mean age and age spread , at least , for the old ( @xmath46 8 gyr ) gcs .",
    "many m31 gcs are resolved by @xmath7 and for those we get hb morphology directly , which makes possible a comparison of the integrated properties of gcs with their actual resolved stellar populations ( e.g. , rich et al .",
    "based on the previous @xmath12 uv data for m31 gcs with known hb morphology from @xmath7 observations , paper i confirms that the sensitivity of metallicity and hb morphology to the uv flux is evident in both nuv and fuv bands .",
    "recently , brown et al . (",
    "2004 ) performed a direct age estimation of the m31 gc b379 by fitting its deep @xmath7 acs photometry extending below the msto .",
    "the extreme stellar crowding caused by the compactness of the cluster results in a less well determined cmd , leading to a somewhat weak age constraint 10@xmath48 gyr .",
    "nonetheless , they suggest that b379 appears to be 2  3 gyr younger than galactic gcs with similar metallicities .",
    "the cmd of b379 shows a tight clump of red hb population consistent with its metallicity and suggested age ( brown et al .",
    "2004 ; rich et al .",
    "we detect this cluster ( _ filled circle _ ) only in the nuv passband and its @xmath40 color is in good agreement with its hb morphology .    due to the increased depth of our uv images compared to paper i , the number of nuv- and fuv - detected gcs with [ fe / h ] @xmath49 has grown .",
    "it is interesting to note that metal - rich gcs have a wide dispersion of uv colors [ @xmath40@xmath5 4  6 ] in the [ fe / h ] vs. @xmath50 plot .",
    "furthermore , although the @xmath50 color is relatively less sensitive to the age variation , metal - rich gcs appear to distribute tightly around isochrone of @xmath42 = + 2 gyr . since there is no clear evidence that the metal - rich gcs in m31 are systematically older than metal - poor counterparts ( e.g. , jiang et al .",
    "2003 ; puzia et al .",
    "2005 ) , this feature may reflect the variation of hb morphology and uv flux of m31 metal - rich gcs due to parameters other than metallicity and age ( see sec . 4 for details ) .",
    "contrary to the case for most galactic gcs with [ fe / h ] @xmath5 @xmath51  @xmath52 , many metal - rich m31 gcs show bluer @xmath50 colors ( i.e. , stronger uv flux ) .",
    "even some metal - rich gcs show comparable @xmath50 colors to those of intermediate metallicity gcs with [ fe / h ] @xmath5 @xmath53  @xmath54 .",
    "only two peculiar metal - rich galactic gcs , ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 have nuv colors comparable to those of metal - rich m31 gcs . among the metal - rich m31 gcs , three gcs are also detected in fuv .",
    "most metal - rich gcs detected in nuv are considered to have blue hb stars which contribute flux in nuv passbands , whereas three metal - rich gcs detected in fuv would have more extreme hot blue hb populations ( e.g. , ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 in the milky way ; see sec . 4 for details ) .",
    "in this respect , bright uv flux in m31 metal - rich gcs is in good agreement with the explanation that stronger h@xmath55 lines observed in m31 metal - rich gcs result from the presence of old blue hb stars ( peterson et al .",
    "2003 ) instead of them being significantly younger than the bulk of m31 gcs ( burstein et al . 1984 ) .",
    "galactic gcs such as ngc 1851 and ngc 2808 exhibit bimodal hb distributions , where separate group of hot hb populations coexist with cooler hb components .",

    "there are four intermediate - age clusters in common between beasley et al .",

    "the model isochrones in fig .",
    "14 are for old ( 10 , 12 , and 14 gyr ; _ dotted lines _ ) , intermediate ( 5 gyr ; _ solid line _ ) , and young ( 1 gyr ; _ long dashed line _ ) ages .",
    "the most striking feature of fig .",
    "14 is that all but one ( b126 ) of the intermediate - age gc candidates detected in fuv are placed in the color - color diagram generally occupied by old gcs of age @xmath5 12  14 gyr .",
    "this suggests that most , if not all , of these intermediate - age gc candidates are in fact as old as the oldest m31 gcs . in this regard ,",
    "it is important to note that intermediate - age cluster candidates b311 ( bursten et al . 2004 ) and b058 ( puzia et al . 2005 ) show clearly developed blue hbs in recent @xmath7 cmds by rich et al .",
    "individual cmds for other intermediate - age gcs will give definitive answers to how the balmer lines are affected by the presence of blue hb populations .",
    "we present the @xmath12 nuv and fuv photometry for gcs in m31 based on a mosaic of observations covering the whole of m31 . by cross - matching with objects in the rbc catalog",
    ", we detected 485 and 273 gcs in nuv and fuv , respectively , which are the most complete and homogeneous uv data for m31 gcs .",
    "we present our final uv catalog of m31 gcs , which is complemented with optical and near - infrared photometry for all uv - detected gcs .",
    "we find that uv@xmath2optical color plays an important role as an age indicator while other possible contamination should be carefully considered ( e.g. , existence of extreme hb stars due to the helium variation among stellar populations in a gc ; lee et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) . at a given metallicity ,",
    "the older populations with bluer hb stars are relatively uv bright , especially in the fuv passband . comparing m31 data with galactic gcs in the uv based on our population models that include the treatment of the detailed systematic variation of hb morphology with age and metallicity , we find that the age ranges of old gcs in m31 and galactic halo are similar . while deep hst imaging of field populations in m31 find that disparate distant fields all show substantial 6 - 10 gyr age ranges with only a minority of old stars ( brown et al .",
    "2006 ) our uv study of the gcs continues to confirm the view that the gcs of m31 is old and similar to that of the milky way , except for a minority of either very young or intermediate - age clusters .",
    "the _ galex _ mission will rapidly enlarge the sample of gcs in nearby galaxies within 3  4 mpc and enable us to quantify any systematic mean age differences between cluster systems , modulo issues such as the effect of minority helium enriched populations .",
    "metal - rich gcs have a hint of wide dispersion of nuv colors , which reflects the variation of hb morphology and uv flux of metal - rich gcs in m31 due to parameters other than metallicity and age .",
    "furthermore , while most metal - rich gcs are faint in the fuv , we find three candidate metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath3 ) gcs with significant fuv flux like that found for the peculiar galactic gcs , ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 , with extended blue hb stars .",
    "this indicates that even metal - rich m31 gcs may have hot blue hb populations rivaling any metal - poor gcs .",
    "our discovery demonstrates for the first time that a possible population of hot extreme hb stars can exist in old , metal - rich gcs in m31 .",
    "the uv properties of uv bright metal - rich gcs in m31 and milky way are in good agreement with those of metal - rich gcs in m87 , which suggests that these anomalous uv bright metal - rich gcs may be ubiquitous in many galaxies . in this",
    "regard , deep @xmath7 acs fuv observations ( pid # 10901 ) for gcs of ngc 1399 will provide an opportunity to determine whether gcs in ngc 1399 also share characteristics with those in m87 ( and with uv bright metal - rich gcs in milky way and m31 ) .",
    "according to our population models , the strong uv flux of uv bright metal - rich gcs can be reproduced by even a small fraction of helium enhanced subpopulation in addition to the majority of the population having normal helium abundance within a gc .",
    "we suggest that a reasonable agreement between observed uv colors of uv bright metal - rich gcs and population models can be achieved when we adopt a wide range of helium abundance .",
    "the discovery of uv bright metal - rich gcs is important in the context that the very hot extreme hb stars may be responsible for the upturn in fuv flux seen in luminous metal - rich elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges .",
    "we confirm that the subsystem of blue gcs in m31 with thin - disk kinematics consists of dominantly young ( @xmath13 1 gyr ) gcs .",
    "this is in line with the suggestion that significant formation of possible massive clusters was triggered recent epoch in the disk of m31 .",
    "we also find a thin - disk subset among red gcs in m31 and their ages are likely old ( @xmath8 10 gyr ) . based on our results from @xmath12 uv observations and previous studies of m31 gcs ( fusi pecci et al .",
    "2005 ; puzia et al .",
    "2005 ) , we suggest that the overall feature of m31 thin - disk gcs regarding their formation and evolution is as follows : a small fraction of gcs ( i.e. , red thin - disk gcs ) belonging to the thin - disk are formed at an early epoch and maintain their kinematic properties .",
    "significant formation of a large fraction of gcs ( e.g. blue thin - disk gcs ) appears to have occurred recently ( @xmath13 1 gyr ) in the thin - disk of m31 .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the m31 and milky way gcss are even more different than had previously been suggested .",
    "it is intriguing to note that the formation regions of young thin - disk gcs ( e.g. , morrison et al . 2004 ) coincide with those of massive star formation in the outskirts of m31 observed by @xmath12 ( thilker et al .",
    "2005a ) and @xmath83 ( gordon et al .",
    "this is also consistent with the most recent results of @xmath12 observations that some nearby spiral galaxies ( m33 , m51 , m83 , and m101 , bianchi et al .",
    "2005 ; thilker et al .",
    "2005a , b ) show similar galactocentric gradients of @xmath84 color becoming bluer outward , which indicates younger stellar populations toward the outer parts of the galaxy disk . while it may be tempting to consider a connection between young thin - disk gcs and the recently discovered extended disklike stellar structure around the m31 ( ibata et al .",
    "2005 ) , the age distribution of the m31 disk population at 30 kpc is still dominated by 4 - 10 gyr old stars ( brown et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the discovery of young gc - like objects in the disk of m31 provides an opportunity to study the ongoing process of gc formation at the current epoch and to connect with the properties of old gcs ( larsen 2004 ) .",
    "while many observational results establish the presence of young massive clusters in a variety of environments that are peculiar in some ways ( e.g. , starburst galaxies and merger galaxies ) , the existence of young gcs in m31 disk may be evidence that young massive clusters can form even in the disks of normal spiral galaxies ( see the recent review of larsen 2004 and references therein ) . in this respect , it is important to extend our uv studies of gcs to other galaxies such as m33 , lmc / smc , and cen a. such studies are currently underway and the results will be presented in our forthcoming papers .",
    "we detect 12 and 10 intermediate - age gc candidates classified by previous spectroscopic observations in nuv and fuv , respectively . on the basis of the uv photometry",
    ", we cautiously suggest that some of the spectroscopically identified - age gcs may not be truly intermediate - age objects , but rather older gcs with developed hb stars that contribute to enhanced uv flux as well as balmer lines .",
    "we suggest that the fuv photometry can be an indirect indication of the presence of intermediate - age gcs and may provide a complementary test of the spectroscopic observations for the age dating of gcs . since spectroscopic results and uv photometry are based on the integrated properties of stellar population ,",
    "deep @xmath7 imaging with high spatial resolution for intermediate - age gc candidates is critical in order to derive their hb morphologies . in this respect ,",
    "the outcomes of the @xmath7 acs observations ( pid # 10631 ) of intermediate - age gc candidates ( b337 , b336 , b058 , b049 , b206d , b292 , and b350 ) of m31 are highly anticipated .",
    "this will provide a definite answer to the question of whether spectroscopically derived ages for intermediate - age gcs are due to the truly younger ages or the anomalous hot hb stars . in any case , our @xmath12 uv photometry of the intermediate - age gc candidates will have important implications for spectroscopically derived age and metallicities of clusters in distant stellar populations .",

    "<S> we present ultraviolet ( uv ) photometry of m31 globular clusters ( gcs ) found in 23 _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) images covering the entirety of m31 . </S>",
    "<S> we detect 485 and 273 gcs ( and gc candidates ) in the near - ultraviolet ( nuv ; @xmath0 = 2267  , @xmath1 = 732  ) and far - ultraviolet ( fuv ; @xmath0 = 1516  , @xmath1 = 268  ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our uv catalog has been complemented with existing optical and near - infrared photometry . </S>",
    "<S> the uv properties of gcs have been analyzed using various combinations of uv@xmath2optical and optical@xmath2optical colors considered to be tracers of ages and metallicities for simple stellar populations . comparing m31 data with those of galactic gcs in the uv with the aid of population models that fully take into account detailed systematic variation of horizontal - branch ( hb ) morphology with age and metallicity </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the age ranges of old gcs in m31 and the galactic halo are similar . </S>",
    "<S> three metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath3 ) gcs in m31 produce significant fuv flux making their fuv@xmath4 colors unusually blue for their metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> these are thought to be analogs of the two peculiar galactic gcs ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 with extended blue hb stars . </S>",
    "<S> based on the models incorporating helium enriched subpopulations in addition to the majority of the population that have a normal helium abundance , we suggest that even small fraction of super - helium - rich subpopulations in gcs can reproduce the observed uv bright metal - rich gcs . </S>",
    "<S> young clusters in m31 show distinct uv and optical properties from gcs in milky way . in general , </S>",
    "<S> young clusters are bluer than old gcs in both nuv and fuv . </S>",
    "<S> population models indicate that their typical age is less than @xmath5 2 gyrs and is consistent with the age derived from the most recent high - quality spectroscopic observations </S>",
    "<S> . a large fraction of young gcs have the kinematics of the thin , rapidly rotating disk component . </S>",
    "<S> however , a subset of the old gcs also shares the thin - disk kinematics of the younger clusters . </S>",
    "<S> most gcs with bulge kinematics show old ages . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of young gcs on the outskirts of m31 disk suggests the occurrence of a significant recent star formation in the thin - disk of m31 . </S>",
    "<S> old thin - disk gcs may set constraints on the epoch of early formation of the m31 thin - disk . </S>",
    "<S> we detect 12 ( 10 ) intermediate - age gc candidates in nuv ( fuv ) identified by previous spectroscopic observations . on the basis of comparing our uv photometry to population models </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest that some of spectroscopically identified intermediate - age gcs may not be truly intermediate in age , but rather older gcs that possess developed hb stars which contribute to enhanced uv flux as well as balmer lines . </S>"
