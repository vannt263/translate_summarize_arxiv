    "the rapid development of large clusters built with affordable commodity hardware has highlighted the need for scalable cluster administration software that will help system administrators to deploy , maintain and run large clusters .",
    "scalable cluster administration software is critical for the efficient operation of the 2000 + cpu linux farm at the rhic computing facility ( rcf ) , and this paper describes our experience with cluster administration software currently in use at the rcf .",
    "the rcf is a large scale data processing facility at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) for the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , a collider dedicated to high - energy nuclear physics experiments .",
    "the rcf provides for the computational needs of the rhic experiments ( brahms , phenix , phobos , pp2pp and star ) , including batch , mail , printing and data storage .",
    "in addition , bnl is the u.s .",
    "tier 1 center for atlas computing , and the rcf also provides for the computational needs of the u.s .",
    "collaborators in atlas .",
    "the linux farm at the rcf provides the majority of the cpu power in the rcf .",
    "it is currently listed as the @xmath0 largest cluster , according to `` clusters top500 '' ( http://clusters.top500.org ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the rapid growth of the linux farm in the last few years .",
    "all aspects of its development ( hardware and software ) , operations and maintenance are overseen by the linux farm group , currently a staff of 5 fte within the rcf .",
    "the linux farm is built with commercially available thin rack - mounted , intel - based servers ( 1-u and 2-u form factors ) .",
    "currently , there are 1097 dual - cpu production servers with approximately 917,728 specint2000 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the hardware currently in service in the linux farm .",
    "hardware reliability has not been an issue at the rcf .",
    "the average failure rate is 0.0052 @xmath1 , which translates to 5.7 hardware failures per month at its present size .",
    "hardware failures are dominated by disk and power supply failures . a detailed breakdown of the hardware failures by category is shown in figure 2 .    .linux farm hardware [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "monitoring and control of the cluster hardware , software and infrastructure ( power and cooling ) is provided via a mix of open - source software , rcf - designed software and vendor - provided software .",
    "various components of the monitoring software have been redesigned for scalability purposes and to add various persistent and fault - tolerant features to provide near real - time information reliably .",
    "figure 3 shows the two monitoring models used in the design of the various components of the monitoring software .",
    "figure 4 shows the auto - updating web - interface to the rcf - designed monitoring software , which allows us to view individual server status within the cluster .",
    "figure 5 is the web - interface to the complementary open - source ganglia [ 1 ] monitoring software , which provides monitoring information in a user - friendly format via a web interface .",
    "the rcf used a linux image distribution system that relied on an image server that made the image available via nfs to the linux farm servers .",
    "the image was downloaded and deployed during the rebuilding process . that system worked well until the linux farm grew beyond @xmath2 servers , at which point nfs limitations prevented this system from reliably upgrading a large number of servers simultaneously in                            an acceptable time interval .    in 2001 ,",
    "the rcf switched to redhat s kickstart installer [ 2 ] .",
    "kickstart allowed us to switch to a web - based image server using standard rpm packages .",
    "it has proven very scalable ( 20 minutes / server with 100 s of servers rebuilt simultaneously ) and highly flexible .",
    "multiple images can co - exist with different install options .",
    "both the old and the new kickstart image distribution systems rely on a secure mysql [ 3 ] database system for server authentication and configuration specification .",
    "the rcf uses the open - source , lightweight mysql database software throughout the facility .",
    "mysql enjoys wide support in the open - source community , and it is well documented .",
    "it is used as the general back - end data repository for monitoring , batch control and cluster management purposes at the rcf .",
    "mysql is a scalable and easily configurable database software .",
    "figure 6 shows how mysql databases are configured in the linux farm to achieve high scalability and reliability for monitoring and batch control purposes .",
    "figure 7 shows the perl - tk interface to the mysql database for our batch control and monitoring software .",
    "the linux farm also uses rcf - designed python - based scripts for fast , parallel access to the linux farm servers .",
    "the scripts are used for routine system administration purposes such as installing or updating software .",
    "the scripts are also used for automatic emergency remote power access to the servers during infrastrucure system failures ( ups or cooling ) .",
    "because of the possibility of catastrophic disasters in the case of infrastructure failures ( for example , an electrical fire ) , it is important that the scripts perform fast , parallel and controlled shutdown of the linux farm servers .",
    "figure 9 shows how our python - based scripts fork multiple processes to become a scalable system administration tool .",
    "the rcf also uses vendor - provided software for cluster management .",
    "figure 8 is an example of the user - interface to a software system that is currently deployed in the rcf linux farm .",
    "scalable system software has become an important factor to the rcf for efficiently deploying and managing our rapidly growing linux cluster .",
    "it allows us to monitor the status of individual cluster servers in near - real time , to deploy our linux image in a fast and reliable fashion across the cluster and to access the cluster in a fast , parallel manner .",
    "because not all of our system software needs can be addressed from a single source , it has become necessary for us to use a mix of rcf - designed , open - source and vendor - provided software to achieve our goal of a scalable system software architecture ."
