    "orion a molecular cloud ( orion a hereafter ) is the closest star forming site which is in the vicinity of an ob cluster .",
    "it mainly consists of a dense central gas complex orion kl , which contains plenty of ysos surrounding the central ob stars , and two major giant filaments including the northern branch omc-1,2,3 and southern branch omc-4,5 to l1641 @xcite .",
    "this entire system stores ample resources for the star formation at different mass scales and evolutionary stages .",
    "numerous observations have been performed to explore its physical properties , including the large scale gas distribution , individual young stellar objects ( ysos ) , and the stellar feedback from the o - b clusters . the densest molecular gas in orion a is mainly distributed along the giant filament which has a length of 4 degrees ( 13 pc ) from north to south ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "these studies also show that the molecular gas and the star formation therein are severely influenced by the radiation from the central o - b stars . in the vicinity of the central stars ,",
    "the molecular gas is compressed by the radiation pressure and gas expansion from the hii region , thereby has a tendency to form high - mass cores @xcite .",
    "further to the south of omc-1 , the gas temperature , turbulence , and the molecular core masses all decrease @xcite which might lead to an increased forming rate of low - mass stars @xcite .    to investigate the environmental influence to the star formation",
    ", observations were performed towards individual young star forming sites such as l1641n @xcite .",
    "@xcite systematically surveyed the ysos in this region .",
    "bright @xmath6 outflows were found emanating from a number of stellar objects @xcite .",
    "a closer inspection showed that the co outflow actually has more complex quadruple structure ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sw07 hereafter ) .",
    "@xcite further showed that the stellar emissions might mainly trace the population at later stages ( class - i and ii ) while the less evolved ysos may still be embedded in the dust envelope thus remain undetected .",
    "these younger sources may be critical for revealing the initial conditions in the orion star forming regions , and may help us to understand the difference in the forming conditions for the low- and high - mass stars .    in order to better characterize the initial conditions of the star formation in orion , and evaluate the possibility of forming high - mass stars , surveys with dust and dense gas tracers",
    "were performed towards regions with potential dense and quiescent gas and faint infrared emissions @xcite .",
    "* paper ii hereafter ) identified 51 dust cores from seven fields in orion a region .",
    "there is a fraction of the sources shared in common with other two surveys of orion ysos .",
    "@xcite observed 21 protostars in far - infrared and measured their temperatures .",
    "the sample covered five sources in paper ii , including ori1_8 , ori1_13 , ori2_6 , ori2_7 , and ori8nw_2 .",
    "they were all measured to have @xmath7 k thus classified as class-0 objects . @xcite carried out another extensive survey of orion ysos based on the spitzer / irac emissions and covered 16 sources in paper ii .",
    "for all the shared sources , the ir counterparts were identified as `` p(rotostellar ) '' , indicating evolutionary stages earlier than class-1 .",
    "on the other hand , a large fraction of the sources in paper ii ( 20 objects ) exceed the equivalent bonnor - elbert ( b - e ) mass limit , suggesting that the core mass can be barely supported by the thermal pressure alone . in this case , the cores may possibly undergo gravitational collapse , or otherwise be stabilized by the turbulence and/or magnetic pressure .",
    "these two possibilities would critically determine the subsequent star formation thus require further examination .",
    "moreover , the nh@xmath8 observations on arc - second scales revealed possible temperature and turbulence decline towards the molecular core center @xcite , suggesting that the cores have very weak internal heating thus may approximate prestellar stage .",
    "it calls for further observations with higher resolution and appropriate molecular tracers to better reveal their star - forming conditions .    in this work",
    ", we present the millimeter interferometry observations towards two cores ori8nw_2 and ori2_6 in the paper - ii sample .",
    "these two cores have the highest mass ratio to the b - e limit .",
    "the 350 @xmath9 continuum emission in ori8nw_2 coincides with several ysos in l1641n @xcite , while ori2_6 only have one faint ir source ( hops 11 in @xcite and no .",
    "1100 in @xcite ) .",
    "the two cores were observed in 3.2 mm continuum and @xmath3 and @xmath5 @xmath10 lines .",
    "the @xmath3 can trace the dense quiescent gas due to its relatively stable abundance in the cold pre - stellar environment where many other species are frozen onto the dust grains ( depleted ) .",
    "the @xmath5 is one of the depleted molecules in the pre - stellar environment and would increase in gas phase as being heated by the protostars .",
    "the molecular and dust continuum emissions can reveal three aspects of the stellar evolution : 1 ) the gas distribution near the ysos previously unresolved by the single dish ; 2 ) the dynamical properties of the cores , including the turbulence and potential core collapse and fragmentation ; and 3 ) the molecular abundances which can be further compared with the chemical models and other molecular surveys .",
    "we introduce the observations and data reduction in section 2 and present the reduced data in section 3 . in section 4 to 6 , we analyze the kinematical , dynamical and chemical properties in the cores and discuss the influence from the outflow and star forming activities .",
    "a summary is given in section 7 .",
    "we used the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) to observe the @xmath3 and @xmath5 @xmath11 lines in our two targets .",
    "these data were taken in 2007 and 2008 . during the observations the carma array consisted of 15 antennae , including nine 6.1-meter dishes and six 10.4-meter dishes .",
    "we used two different array configurations : b array ( baselines 100 - 1000 m ) and c array ( baselines 30 - 350 m ) .",
    "more details of the observations are shown in table 1 .",
    "we observed several different quasars for phase , bandpass , and flux calibration .",
    "for the two 2007 datasets , we used 0541 - 056 as the phase calibrator .",
    "the bandpass and flux calibrators were 3c273 ( 2007 - 02 - 10 ) and 0530 + 135 ( 2007 - 03 - 12 ) . in all 2008 observations we used 0530 + 135 as the phase calibrator .",
    "3c84 was used as both a flux and bandpass calibrator , except for 2008 - 11 - 29 data , where 0423 - 013 was used for bandpass and flux . and on 2008 - 11 - 23",
    ", 0423 - 013 was used for the bandpass .",
    "the substitution became necessary when 3c84 was above an elevation of 80@xmath12 .",
    "the quasars for the flux calibration are routinely observed .",
    "based on the variation in those values , we estimate our overall flux accuracy to be @xmath13 .",
    "we set up our correlator so that each sideband had three windows all centered at the same frequency . in each sideband",
    "we had one wide - band window ( approximately 500 mhz in 15 channels ) , one narrow - band window ( approximately 8 mhz in 63 channels ) , and one medium - band window ( approximately 32 mhz in 63 channels ) . in 2007",
    "we only observed @xmath3 , while in 2008 a slightly different correlator setup was used so that @xmath3 and @xmath5 could be simultaneously observed in the two sidebands .",
    "the medium - band window was used to help identify emission in both molecules .",
    "this was especially useful for @xmath3 which has seven hyperfine components spaced over a @xmath14-km s@xmath15 range @xcite .",
    "the narrowband window covers the frequency range of all seven hyperfine components and with better spectral resolution ( 0.4 km s@xmath15 ) .",
    "therefore , we focused on the narrowband data to analyze the two molecular lines .",
    "the data were calibrated using the miriad software package . after visually inspecting the data and flagging intermittent electronic noise on certain baselines and antennas , we performed calibrations for the bandpass ( frequency - dependent variation of the gains ) and flux using the calibrators as shown above .",
    "after the calibrations , we excluded the channel containing @xmath3 and @xmath5 emissions to obtain the 3.2 mm continuum data .",
    "then the different observing tracks ( obtained from b and c arrays respectively ) for each source are combined together and inverted from the ( u , v ) plane to the image plane using the robust parameter of 0.5 .",
    "this value provides a compromise between the sensitivity of natural weighting and the lower side - lobes of uniform weighting .",
    "the combined data has a shortest baseline of 40 k@xmath16 , corresponding to an angular size of @xmath17 .",
    "the spatial structures larger than this scale will not be recovered in our carma maps .",
    "the dirty map produced by inversion was deconvolved using the maximum entropy method ( mem )",
    ". the final clean map was created by convolving the model image produced from mem with a synthesized gaussian clean beam ( using restore command in miriad ) . for ori8nw_2 ,",
    "the clean beam is @xmath18 with a position angle of @xmath19 and for ori2_6 it is @xmath20 with an angle of @xmath21 .",
    "the images were corrected for efficiency of the primary beam which has a fwhm of @xmath22 .",
    "figure 1 and 2 show the channel maps of @xmath5 and @xmath3 @xmath11 lines in the two regions . in ori8nw_2 , we displayed the velocity range that covers the @xmath23 component .",
    "the other two groups of hyper - fine components ( hfcs ) @xmath24 and @xmath25 have have overall similar morphologies but blended components and are not shown here .",
    "the @xmath5 emission in ori8nw_2 shows emission at the systemic velocity and in addition , highly redshifted emission around @xmath26 km s@xmath15 . in ori2_6 ( figure 2 )",
    "the @xmath3 is much weaker , thus the strongest @xmath24 transition is adopted for the display . the @xmath3 is marginally detected at @xmath27 to 7.5 km s@xmath15 , while the @xmath5 emission is bellow the detection limit .",
    "the rms noise level @xmath28 is measured from the emission - free areas in the channel images which is @xmath29 jy beam@xmath15 . in ori8nw_2 , it is equal to @xmath30 k for the both lines .",
    "and in ori2_6 , it corresponds to @xmath31 k and 1.5 k for the @xmath3 and @xmath5 lines , respectively .",
    "we also obtained images at other wavebands , including ( 1 ) the @xmath32 lines from a molecular line survey towards the orion cores using the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) ( ren et al . in prep . ) ; ( 2 ) the mid - infrared images at four spitzer / irac bands ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8 @xmath9 ) and far - infrared images at spitzer / mips 24 and 70 @xmath9 bands ; ( 3 ) the jcmt / scuba 850 @xmath9 continuum images .",
    "the jcmt and mips images are only used to measure the emission intensities and not presented in the paper .",
    "the spitzer images were retrieved from the spitzer heritage archive .",
    "the jcmt data were downloaded from the jcmt science archive .",
    "in figure 3 and 4 , we show the 3.2 mm dust continuum emissions in ori8nw_2 and ori2_6 , with the cso / sharc - ii 350 @xmath9 continuum emission ( gray scale ) and the three - band irac image ( blue=3.6 @xmath9 , green=4.5 @xmath9 , and red=8 @xmath9 ) overlaid .",
    "the molecular emissions are also shown on the figures and are described in section 3.2 . in ori8nw_2 , the 3.2 mm continuum emission exhibits a single compact core located within the 350 @xmath9 emission region ( figure 3a ) . in ori2_6 ,",
    "the 3.2 mm continuum peak coincides with the 350 micron emission within the pointing accuracy of the cso .",
    "we manually adjusted the coordinates of the 350 @xmath9 emission by @xmath33 to the east so that its emission peak overlaps with the peak of the 3.2 mm continuum .    at the irac bands ( figure 3c ) ,",
    "ori8nw_2 contains five bright ir sources which are located within or near the 350 @xmath9 emission region .",
    "we encircled them with dashed lines and labeled them following the previous denominations @xcite .",
    "the two most evolved ysos ( no.120 and 117 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are bright at the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 bands , are barely detected at the irac bands . in comparison , the other stellar objects ( 123 , 124 etc . )",
    "can be clearly seen at the irac bands . among them",
    "no.116 is the closest to the 3.2 mm peak ( zero offset in figure 3c ) . in ori2_6 ( figure 4c ) , there is only one single isolated ir source associated with the 3.2 mm continuum core .    the temperature , core mass and other physical parameters of the dust cores can be estimated from the dust continuum emissions .",
    "the results are summarized in table 2 .",
    "we first estimated the dust temperature by fitting the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "we measured the flux densities of the cores at the irac 24 @xmath9 and mips 70 @xmath9 bands . at those bands , both ori8nw_2 and ori2_6 exhibit a compact core coincident with the 350 @xmath9 emission .",
    "the @xmath37 flux densities are taken from @xcite .",
    "in addition , for ori8nw_2 , we also took the continuum flux density at 1.3 mm ( 3.1 jy ) from sw07 , and at 2.0 mm ( 0.272 jy ) from @xcite .",
    "we adopt a gray - body emission model to fit the sed @xcite ,    @xmath38    wherein @xmath39 is the flux density at frequency @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the total gas - and - dust mass of the core , @xmath42 is commonly adopted gas - to - dust mass ratio , @xmath43 is the planck function at @xmath44 , the dust temperature , @xmath45 pc is the source distance @xcite , and @xmath46 is the dust opacity and is assumed to have a power - law shape , i.e. @xmath47 , with the reference value of @xmath48 @xmath49 g@xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the best - fit sed curves are shown in figure 6 . in ori8nw_2",
    ", we found that the emission from 70 @xmath9 to 1.3 mm can be fitted with @xmath50 k and @xmath51 .    at shorter wavelengths ( irac and mips 24 @xmath9 bands )",
    "the flux densities have excess above the sed curve which should arise from hot gas component at vicinity of the stars .",
    "the hot component is less accurately constrained by the available data points , but based on its local maximum intensity at around 24 @xmath9 , we can roughly estimate @xmath52 k from wien s displacement law .",
    "the 2.0 mm and 3.2 mm continuum emissions are both bellow the sed curve due to the extended emission being filtered by the interferometers . in ori2_6 , the temperature ( cold component ) is only constrained by 75 @xmath9 ( mips ) , 350 @xmath9 ( cso ) , and 850 @xmath9 ( scuba ) data . in order to reduce the parameters",
    ", we fit the sed assuming a same @xmath53 as in ori8nw_2 .",
    "the temperature fitting gives @xmath54 k. in both ori8nw_2 and ori2_6 , the sed is characterized by a major cold dust component of @xmath55 k and a faint hot one of @xmath56 k. such sed shape is suggestive of a class-0 object @xcite . by fitting the entire sed",
    ", @xcite estimate an average bolometric temperature of @xmath57 and 59 k for ori8nw_2 ( hops 182 therein ) and ori2_6 ( hops 11 ) , respectively .",
    "these temperatures also suggest class-0 stage according to their proposed threshold of @xmath58 k. the bolometric luminosities of the two cores are derived through the integral @xmath59 .",
    "all the derived parameters are shown in table 2 .",
    "we also calculated the total gas mass of the 3.2 mm continuum core using equation ( 1 ) , and obtained @xmath60 and 1.6 @xmath61 for ori8nw_2 and ori2_6 respectively . the carma 3.2 mm core should mainly trace the densest central region while the cso 350 @xmath9 core largely represent the extended envelope which takes up a considerable fraction of the core mass and is largely filtered out in the carma observations .",
    "the h@xmath62 column density @xmath63 and number density @xmath64 are also estimated from the continuum emissions .",
    "@xmath63 is calculated from the intensity at the continuum peak , which represents an average within one beam area . to estimate @xmath64",
    ", we assumed the core to have a spherical shape so that the dust column length is equal to the mean diameter ( measured from the 4@xmath28 contour size deconvolved with beam size as shown in table 2 ) . the derived column and number densities",
    "are also presented in table 2 . for the both sources ,",
    "the 3.2 mm core is comparable to the beam size , suggesting that the cores are marginally resolved . in this case",
    ", the derived @xmath63 and @xmath64 would represent a lower limit .",
    "both ori8nw_2 and ori2_6 exhibit remarkably high @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the 3.2 mm continuum core .",
    "such high densities are only observed in a few sources , including the orion kl cores @xcite and some protostellar - disk candidates @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the 350 @xmath9 continuum cores have much lower column densities , suggesting that the gas distribution is very concentrated at the core center so that the extended envelope only has a minor contribution to @xmath63 in spite of its large mass . in the opposite case ,",
    "i.e. , if the density profile were relatively flat , a larger fraction of the column density would be resolved out by the interferometers so that the @xmath63 and @xmath64 values would be significantly lower than those for the 350 @xmath9 continuum core .    to better reveal the dust - and - gas distributions",
    ", we reconstructed the @xmath63 maps from the 3.2 mm and 350 @xmath9 continuum emissions , as shown in figure 7 . in calculation , we first convolve the 3.2 mm emission with the cso beam , as to mimic observing the central dense core with the cso beamsize at 350 @xmath9 .",
    "then the @xmath63 map was estimated from the convolved 3.2 mm and 350 @xmath9 continuum images respectively . as a result , the 3.2 mm emission exhibits a peak @xmath63 only slightly lower than that for the 350 @xmath9 emission .",
    "this is consistent with the speculation that the @xmath63 at the center is mainly contributed by the central dense core while the extended envelope only has a minor contribution .",
    "the morphology of the envelope can be better revealed by subtracting the dense gas component ( calculated from the 3.2 mm emission ) from the overall @xmath63 distribution ( from the 350 @xmath9 emission ) .",
    "the residual @xmath63 distributions in ori8nw_2 and ori2_6 are shown in figure 7b and 7d , respectively .",
    "after subtraction , the residual @xmath63 map exhibits a quite flat profile within a spatial range of 1 arcmin , with a median value of @xmath65 @xmath66 .",
    "the residual @xmath63 slightly increases towards the northeast and southwest of the center as due to the slight elongation of the 350 @xmath9 core in this direction . in ori2_6 , after the subtracting the 3.2 mm continuum core , @xmath63 also shows a roughly uniform distribution which has a slight decrease at the center and is elongated from nw to se .    by averaging @xmath63 at each radius",
    ", we calculated the one - dimensional @xmath63 profile for the 350 @xmath9 core , the 3.2 mm core and the envelope ( residual ) .",
    "the three components are presented in figure 7e and 7f . from the center to outside , the residual @xmath63 ( envelope component ) shows a small variation scale of 0.1 to 0.2 @xmath67 @xmath66 .",
    "the figure also shows that in ori2_6 the 3.2 mm continuum core takes up a lower fraction of @xmath63 than in ori8nw_2 .",
    "considering the fact that ori8nw_2 contains several more evolved ysos , this may reflect the trend that molecular cores are becoming more centrally concentrated during the core evolution @xcite .",
    "this trend is to be further examined from the density profiles in more pre- and protostellar cores in the orion molecular cloud .",
    "the velocity integrated @xmath3 and @xmath5 emissions in the both cores are presented in figure 3 and 4 . in ori8nw_2 ,",
    "the @xmath3 emission exhibits a filament with a spatial scale of @xmath68 ( 0.13 pc ) from northeast to southwest . and",
    "the filament is resolved into six major gas clumps which are labeled as c1 to c6 in figure 3a .",
    "besides the major filament , the @xmath3 image also shows other two clumps to the north and south of the center cavity shell ( labeled as c7 and c8 respectively ) , and in addition , some weak , dispersed gas fragments in the northwest .",
    "the @xmath5 @xmath10 emission ( figure 3b ) has a smaller extent than the @xmath3 .",
    "it has three major emission peaks including one at the continuum peak and the other two in the southwest .",
    "the @xmath5 @xmath10 clumps are aligned roughly parallel to the @xmath3 filament but has an overall @xmath69-shift to the north .",
    "there are two @xmath5 clumps coincident with the ir sources no.123 and 116 while the @xmath3 apparently decreases towards these two sources .    in ori2_6",
    ", the @xmath3 emission mainly shows a weak and irregularly shaped gas clump located on the southwest side of the 3.2 mm continuum core , while the @xmath5 @xmath10 does not show emission feature above the noise level ( 0.04 jy beam@xmath15 km s@xmath15 , as measured from the channel images ) . at the irac bands",
    ", ori2_6 has only one faint point source associated with the 3.2 mm continuum and the @xmath5 emission ( figure 4c ) . the less active star formation in ori2_6 than in ori8nw_2",
    "is some what unexpected as seen from their larger - scale environments . over several - arcmin scales ,",
    "ori2 region exhibits multiple dust clumps aligned in filamentary structures , while ori8nw_2 is almost isolated at the same scale and more distant from the omc center ( paper ii , figure 3 and 5 therein ) .",
    "a possible explanation is that star formation in ori8nw_2 is largely triggered by the cloud - cloud collision ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also figure 4 ) .",
    "while in ori2 , although there are multiple cores in a small region , they may currently maintain a stable structure , and have little interactions with each other .    in ori8nw_2 , both the @xmath3 and @xmath5 emission exhibit multiple clumps at different velocities as shown in figure 1 and 3 .",
    "to more clearly elucidate the gas morphology and compare with the previous results , we show the velocity - integrated @xmath3 emissions and labeled the major gas structures in figure 5 .",
    "in general , the @xmath3 emission shows a filamentary structure from northeast to southwest which is intercepted by a central cavity - and - shell structure . the 3.2 mm core is located at the northern edge of the cavity wall . and the quadruple outflow system ( sw07 , with the directions shown in arrows ) is closely correlated with the @xmath3 emission region .",
    "one can see that the collimated northeast - southwest outflow is nearly parallel to the @xmath3 filament while the more diffused north - south outflow is propagating through the filament and further to the south .",
    "figure 5b shows the picture of the cloud - cloud collision on larger spatial scale @xcite .",
    "the collisional interface is from northeast to southwest , thus roughly parallel to the @xmath3 filament and the ne - sw outflow .",
    "the molecular gas may therefore be shaped by a net effect from the outflow and the cloud - cloud collision .",
    "the kinematical properties are discussed in more detail in section 4.1 .",
    "we calculated the @xmath3 column density based on optical depth derived from fitting the hfcs .",

    "as shown in sw07 ( and also seen in figure 1 ) , the collimated ne - sw flow has a velocity distribution from @xmath97 to 20 km s@xmath15 , while the southern branch of the red lobe becomes weak at @xmath98 km s@xmath15 .",
    "although the actual outflow velocities are uncertain due to the inclination angle , the ne - sw flow is likely to have higher velocities due to the compact and collimated shape .",
    "this suggests that the outflow velocity should be a key factor to determine the chemical effect .",
    "since the @xmath3 and @xmath5 both appear to be affected by the outflow , their kinematic properties should be further examined .",
    "we plotted the intensity - weighted radial - velocity field ( first moment map ) and the velocity - dispersion ( second moment map ) of the @xmath3 in figure 9b and 9c , respectively .",
    "the two maps are calculated from the single - peaked @xmath99 component ( f=93.17613 ghz ) .",
    "as shown in figure 9b , the velocity field of @xmath3 shows no significant deviation from the systemic @xmath100 , nor any velocity gradient over the emission region .",
    "it only shows moderate redshift features at several positions overlapped with the outflow , including the southern edge of the cavity wall , and the northwestern edge of the filament where the red lobe ( dashed contours ) goes over .",
    "@xcite identified three concentrically expanding shells on larger scales which are also plotted in figure 5b .",
    "a question is whether the cavity wall in the @xmath3 emission represent another recently formed shell in a similar physical process . to our expectation ,",
    "an expanding shell would exhibit both blue- and redshift feature as well as an increased velocity dispersion since it is moving towards all directions .",
    "however , the cavity wall only shows redshifted emission ( figure 9b ) and a slightly higher velocity dispersion ( up to 1 km s@xmath15 , figure 9c ) . inside the cavity wall ,",
    "the @xmath3 is not detected above the uncertainty level of 0.06 jy beam@xmath15 km s@xmath15 , which limits the column density to be @xmath101 @xmath66 .",
    "this upper limit is almost two orders of magnitudes smaller than @xmath102 at the cavity wall , suggesting that the cavity wall is more likely a 2-dimensional ring - like structure rather than a spherical shell .",
    "the @xmath5 is closely associated with the outflow for its velocity distribution .",
    "its spatial correlation with the outflow , radial velocity , and velocity dispersion map are shown in figure 9d to 9f .",
    "figure 9d shows that the three major @xmath5 gas clumps reasonably coincide with the local emission peaks in the red lobe .",
    "figure 9e shows that the redshift pattern in @xmath5 well coincides with the spatial extent of the co outflow .",
    "the fraction of the @xmath5 covered by the outflow also shows increased velocity dispersion ( increasing from the average value of @xmath103 km s@xmath15 to @xmath104 km s@xmath15 , figure 9f ) . from figure 1 we see that a bulk of the redshifted @xmath5 emission appears at @xmath97 to 12 km s@xmath15 and becomes weaker at lower velocities ( 8.5 to 9.5 km s@xmath15 ) .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath5 might be largely produced in the ( redshifted ) outflow rather than merely entrained from the ambient gas .",
    "both ori8nw_2 and ori2_6 have considerable total masses for their cso 350 @xmath9 continuum cores ( table 2 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath3 emissions reveal low - mass gas clumps at smaller scales , and the 3.2 mm continuum core also has gas masses of only @xmath105 , suggesting that the two cores are currently only forming low - mass stars .",
    "although the carma observations may have largely missed extended structures , their low bolometric luminosities ( table 2 ) also suggest the absence of high - mass stars .",
    "the ir sources in ori8nw_2 are found to have a total luminosity even lower than the dust core luminosity .",
    "there are mainly 6 ir point sources observed at the irac bands labeled as no.115 , 116 , 117 , 120 , 123 , 124 ( * ? ? ? * also see figure 3c ) .",
    "we can get their seds by interpolating the measured flux at four irac bands ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 11 therein ) , and then derive the integrated luminosities . as a result ,",
    "the ir sources all have luminosities at @xmath106 scale . among the ir sources , no .",
    "117 and 120 are very faint at irac bands but are detected in the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 bands and estimated to have 0.15 and 0.02 @xmath107 ( table 6 therein ) .",
    "for ori2_6 , the central irac source is measured to have 0.12 @xmath107 , thus also much fainter than the entire dust core ( @xmath108 ) . on the other hand , based on the stellar reddening measured by @xcite",
    ", we obtained a moderate extinction of @xmath109}=1.1 $ ] for ori8 region .",
    "this suggests that the stellar objects with high luminosities are not likely to be largely obscured at the irac bands .",
    "considering the faintness of the ir sources , the bolometric luminosities of the dust cores should be mainly contributed by the external heating .",
    "another potential influence to the molecular distribution comes from the cloud - cloud interaction @xcite , which might have compressed the @xmath3 gas , causing it to be extended nearly in the same orientation with the collisional interface(figure 7b ) .",
    "the interaction might also aid the mass accumulation , causing ori8nw_2 to become the most massive core over one - square - degree region .",
    "but the interaction did not lead to high - mass star formation in this region .",
    "paper ii investigated the gravitational instabilities of ori8nw_2 and ori2_6 based on the assumption that the molecular cores are gravitationally bound . using the currently observed molecular lines",
    ", we can better estimate the dynamical state in two major aspects : ( 1 ) whether the cores are gravitationally bound ( the state of virial equilibrium ) ; ( 2 ) the possibility for gravitational collapse and fragmentation .",
    "the virial mass can be estimated from @xmath110 wherein @xmath111 is the average radius .",
    "@xmath28 is the velocity dispersion .",
    "@xmath112 is the geometry factor determined by eccentricity @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath114 for a power - law density profile @xmath115 @xcite , and @xmath116 is the constant of gravity .",
    "we adopt @xmath117 which characterizes a static singular isothermal sphere @xcite , and @xmath118 since the both the 350 @xmath9 and the 3.2 mm cores are roughly spherical .",
    "and we considered the velocity dispersion from both the @xmath3 and @xmath119 lines for the calculation , which would reflect the turbulence in the quiescent dense gas and the more extended gas components , respectively .",
    "the estimated virial masses are shown in table 2 .    in ori8nw_2 , from the velocity dispersion measured from the @xmath3 line , we can get @xmath120 for the 350 @xmath9 core , which is largely smaller than the lte gas mass . using the @xmath119 line width instead",
    ", the derived @xmath121 is still lower than @xmath41 , suggesting that the core should be gravitationally bound .",
    "one uncertainty is that the calculation of @xmath41 depends on the adopted temperature .",
    "for example , using @xmath122 k @xcite , the core mass would decrease to @xmath123 which is significantly smaller than @xmath124 .",
    "for ori2_6 , using @xmath125 k @xcite would provide @xmath126 which is also smaller than @xmath124 .",
    "the dense pre- and protostellar cores should be close to virial equilibrium .",
    "for example , @xcite studied a large sample of @xmath5 cores over the entire orion a filament and found them to be mostly virialized .",
    "the @xmath5 cores on their observational scales are measured to have densities of only @xmath127 to @xmath128 @xmath66 . in comparison ,",
    "the compact massive dense cores on smaller scales should be more gravitationally bound .",
    "the suggestion is that the major fraction of the 350 @xmath9 continuum core should have moderately low temperatures , likely in a range of 20 - 30 k , so that the derived core masses can exceed the virial masses . in particular , assuming an ideal virial equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath129 , we can obtain @xmath130 k from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "@xcite also used two - temperature model to fit the sed of several class-0 orion cores , and obtained @xmath131 k for the cold components which are consistent with the temperature estimate from the molecular lines .",
    "the high temperature values for our two cores should still be valid , but mainly reflect the hot gas components surrounding the stars , and can be distinguished from the cold gas in the sed fitting ( figure 5 ) .",
    "we also examined the virial state of the central 3.2 mm continuum cores . for ori8nw_2 , since the @xmath5 emission is closely associated with the 3.2 mm continuum cores , we adopt its line width and the upper limit of @xmath132 and then estimated @xmath133 which is even smaller than @xmath134 estimated at @xmath135 k. thus the 3.2 mm continuum core may also be gravitationally bound unless its temperature is even higher so that the gas mass is overestimated . in ori2_6 ,",
    "the velocity dispersion for the 3.2 mm continuum core is less well determined due to the absence of molecular lines at the core center .",
    "using the @xmath3 line detected near the 3.2 mm continuum core , we can get @xmath136 . in comparison",
    ", it has a total gas mass of 0.3 - 0.8 @xmath61 , thus should be close to the virial equilibrium .",
    "the second aspect of the dynamical state is the stability against collapse and fragmentation .",
    "the critical mass @xmath137 to be sustained by the internal force is @xmath138 , wherein @xmath139 and @xmath140 represent the mass to be supported by the random gas motion ( thermal motion and turbulence ) and magnetic pressure , respectively .",
    "the two components can be estimated using the same procedures in ( * ? ? ? * and the references therein ) .",
    "the jeans mass for a non - magnetic isothermal cloud @xcite is @xmath141 wherein @xmath142 is the external pressure , and can be estimated as @xmath143 wherein @xmath144 is the atomic hydrogen mass and @xmath145 is the average molecular weight @xcite . in calculation",
    "we adopt an environmental velocity dispersion of @xmath146 km s@xmath15 , and density of @xmath147 @xmath2 as measured from the extended @xmath148 emission @xcite .",
    "the external pressure is calculated to be @xmath149 k @xmath2 .",
    "assuming that the observed @xmath3 line width represents the total random gas motion ( thermal motion and turbulence ) , we can get @xmath150 km s@xmath15 and @xmath151 .",
    "the total jeans mass is much lower than the lte gas mass , suggesting that the random gas motion ( thermal motion and turbulence ) can hardly support the core against collapse .",
    "the maximum mass to be stabilized by the @xmath152 field is @xmath153 where @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath155 mg in the omc-1 region where the gas density is @xmath156 @xmath2 , and later derived a power law of @xmath157 from a number of orion cores @xcite . using this result , we can estimate @xmath158 mg for gas density in ori8nw_2 ( @xmath159 @xmath2 ) .",
    "@xcite observed oh masers in orion - kl and derived @xmath160 mg .",
    "@xcite observed the polarized dust continuum emission also in orion - kl and suggested a field intensity of @xmath161 mg .",
    "for ori8nw_2 , we can then derive @xmath162 to @xmath163 as the @xmath152-field varies from 0.66 to 3 mg .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath152-field is possible to provide a considerable support to the core if the field strength is at the milli - gauss level .",
    "if the collapse is ongoing , the typical fragmentation scale , namely the jeans length can be estimated and compared with the @xmath3 clumps to see whether they are close to each other .",
    "the jeans length is calculated using @xmath164 @xcite , where @xmath165 is the gas density .",
    "using the gas density of the 350 @xmath9 core and @xmath28 from the @xmath3 line width , the jeans length is estimated to be @xmath166 arcsec . for the magnetic pressure , assuming a velocity dispersion comparable to the alfvn velocity @xmath167",

    "first , the jeans length would become lower as the gas density increases towards the core center , while the @xmath152-field only moderately increase with the density if it follows the power law in @xcite . using the gas density in the central dense core ( @xmath1 @xmath2 )",
    ", we can get @xmath173 . to reach a fragmentation scale rightly at @xmath3 clump size ( @xmath69 ) , a density of @xmath174 @xmath2",
    "is required which is achievable as comparing to the overall density range .",
    "second , the magnetic turbulence can in the mean time cause density fluctuation thus motivate the fragmentation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) . using the method in (",
    "* equation ( 5 ) to ( 7 ) therein ) , we can obtain a fragmentation length of @xmath175 to @xmath176 as the gas density varying from @xmath177 to @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "this spatial range is compatible with the @xmath3-clump scales . in fact , multiple clumps with sizes around @xmath178 have already been observed in orion kl @xcite . and the clumps further exhibit substructures at even smaller scales .",
    "the condensations are apparently smaller than @xmath179 derived from the @xmath152 field strength therein , suggesting that the @xmath152-field might not effectively halt the fragmentation or might even provide an enhancement .",
    "third , if there is currently no fragmentation in ori8nw_2 , the observed @xmath3 clumps may have to be solely shaped by the outflow or / and by the cloud - cloud interaction .",
    "this case is not fully consistent with the fact that the @xmath3 clumps have small velocity gradient and dispersion , and at the mean time spatially displaced from the observed outflow ( figure 9a ) .",
    "the possibility of the fragmentation can be further examined by looking at internal structures in other similar orion cores with sensitive dense gas tracers , and more accurately measuring the @xmath152-field strength and its spatial correlation with the gas structures .",
    "in this section we discuss the chemical properties related with @xmath3 and @xmath5 . in most cases ,",
    "the @xmath3 would closely trace the the dense quiescent gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but the outflow and stellar heating may cause a deviation from the general trend , as observed in our two cores . as shown in figure 3 , in ori8nw_2 , the @xmath3",
    "is spatially displaced from the 3.2 mm continuum and the @xmath5 emissions . in ori2_6 ,",
    "the weakly detected @xmath3 emission is also offset from the 3.2 mm continuum core ( figure 4 ) .    in ori8nw_2",
    ", the @xmath5 mainly traces the outflow and lies in the close proximity of the @xmath3 . towards the stellar objects no.123 and 116 ( figure 3b )",
    ", the @xmath5 exhibits a local emission peak while the @xmath3 obviously declines .",
    "therefore the @xmath3 is likely being directly converted to @xmath5 via the reaction @xmath180 the reaction is endothermic , thus when temperature is low , the energy source like outflow would sensitively reduce the @xmath3 and increase the @xmath5 , causing the observed features . besides reaction ( a )",
    ", the @xmath5 can also be produced from @xmath181 reaction ( a ) and ( b ) are both taking place in the irdcs @xcite . but ( b ) might be less important in producing the @xmath5 in our dense cores since the @xmath5 shows a close dependence on the @xmath3 distribution . in less dense and more extended gas component , reaction ( b ) would be more significant as the co becomes depleted and @xmath182 also becomes more abundant due to the photo dissociation .",
    "this speculation is consistent with the single - dish observation @xcite which shows broad @xmath183 emission over ori8 region ( l1641n ) with a spatial extent of 5 arcmin .",
    "the gas density at this scale was measured to be only @xmath127 to @xmath128 @xmath2 , which is largely different from the gas component in the compact dense cores .",
    "the abundance ratio between @xmath3 and @xmath5 ( @xmath184/[hco^+]}$ ] ) can reflect the chemical evolution in the molecular gas .",

    "this trend can be compared with the observed abundances .    in figure 10 , we plot @xmath184/[hco^+]}$ ] as a function of [ co ] derived from the model , and overlaid the observed values in our two cores .",
    "the arrow on the ori2_6 data represents lower limit of @xmath184/[hco^+]}$ ] due to the barely detected @xmath5 emission . in the figure ,",
    "the abundances calculated at high temperatures @xcite are also presented in open squares . at both temperature limits ,",
    "the observed data are consistent with general trend that @xmath184/[hco^+]}$ ] declines with [ co ] .",
    "this proves that the co should be a major controller for the @xmath5 production . at low temperatures ,",
    "the derived abundance ratios are close to the modeled curve , while at high temperatures , @xmath184/[hco^+]}$ ] become much higher .",
    "this is within expectation since the model parameters are also originated from the observed values at low temperatures .",
    "there are three irdcs in @xcite also with available [ co ] measurement @xcite .",
    "their @xmath184/[hco^+]}$ ] and [ co ] are presented together in figure 10 .",
    "the irdcs have [ co]@xmath188 and @xmath184/[hco^+]}\\gtrsim0.1 $ ] thus are close to the modeled curve .",
    "this suggests that the different @xmath184/[hco^+]}$ ] ratios between our cores and the irdcs can be explained by their different co abundances .",

    "the three additional orion cores also show relatively high [ co ] and small @xmath184/[hco^+]}$ ] compared to ori8nw_2 and ori2_6 . however , the orion cores together show a more rapid decline trend than the model prediction , i.e. , at [ co]@xmath189 , the modeled @xmath184/[hco^+]}$ ] approaches 0.1 , while the three additional orion cores have reached @xmath184/[hco^+]}\\sim10^{-2}$ ] . from examining the two species individually ,",

    "the outflow , cloud - cloud collision , fragmentation could all be involved in forming these gas clumps .",
    "since the outflow impact or the cloud - cloud collision is not evidently shown in the velocity field of the @xmath190 , the fragmentation might be more important in producing the clumps .",
