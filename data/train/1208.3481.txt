    "quantum liquids are among the most sought after states of matter .",
    "one celebrated class of such quantum liquids , the fractional quantum - hall ( fqh ) states ,  @xcite has been a locus of scientific attention for almost three decades . initially introduced to explain the fractional quantum - hall effect ( fqhe ) observed in semiconductor devices ,  @xcite they describe interacting electrons constrained in two dimensions and subject to a strong perpendicular magnetic field . fractionally filling a magnetic landau level ( ll )",
    "then yields an incompressible fqh liquid and gives rise to a precisely quantized hall conductivity .",
    "in addition , the quasiparticles of these states obey anyonic statistics ,  @xcite which can be either abelian or non - abelian , the latter fulfilling an essential condition for fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "@xcite    an alternative route to quantum hall liquids is via tightly bound electrons moving in a magnetic texture . the simplest such magnetic texture is a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the system . for non - interacting , tightly bound electrons , this gives rise to an integer quantum - hall ( iqh ) state and leads to hofstadter s fractal energy spectrum ,  @xcite whereas in a fractionally filled tight - binding model of electrons interacting via a screened coulomb repulsion , the realization of a fqh state is possible .",
    "@xcite haldane noted  @xcite that an external magnetic field is not the only viable path to iqh states and introduced a honeycomb - lattice model , with complex hoppings that break time - reversal invariance , and defined the first integer chern insulator ( ci ) , in which the total magnetic field through the unit cell averages to zero .",
    "in the meantime , mechanisms leading to complex hoppings with the necessary properties have been identified .",
    "one realization may be found in strongly spin - orbit coupled semiconductor materials that are ferromagnetically ordered .",
    "@xcite another possibility arises through the coupling of itinerant electrons to localized magnetic moments ,  @xcite for example the kondo - lattice model on the triangular lattice supports a non - trivial magnetic texture , which induces an integer - quantized hall conductivity of the itinerant electrons .",
    "@xcite    a considerable body of recent research has addressed the question whether the lattice counterpart of the fqhe can be observed when topologically non - trivial bands , called chern bands , are fractionally filled and electrons are interacting . several numerical studies using exact diagonalization techniques have convincingly established the existence of laughlin - series states in an number of different models on various lattices .",
    "@xcite these systems have since been called fractional chern insulators ( fci ) . very recent work has reported fci states beyond laughlin fractions .",
    "@xcite in addition to reproducing the known fqhe on a lattice and potentially at higher temperatures , cis also offer the intriguing possibility of a chern number higher than one , a departure from the analogy with lls .",
    "recent studies have explored this direction by constructing models that have higher chern numbers and studying possible fci states .",
    "@xcite from the analytical side , the problem of fci states has been approached by a careful study of emergent translational symmetries  @xcite and many - body trial wave functions .",
    "@xcite others have examined the algebraic properties of the density operators projected onto one chern band and made a comparison with the girvin - macdonald - platzman algebra that is satisfied by the lowest ll density operators in the continuum fqhe .",
    "@xcite    in numerical studies of fci states , one typically starts by adding inter - site interactions to topologically nontrivial but non - interacting ci models . as potential realizations of the non - interacting and nearly flat ``",
    "parent '' bands , cold atoms ,  @xcite oxide heterostructures ,  @xcite strained graphene ,  @xcite and strongly correlated multi - orbital models for layered oxides  @xcite have been proposed . in the present paper , we build upon this last approach and thus focus our attention on a strongly correlated model on the triangular lattice .",
    "it was shown that on the mean - field level and near half - filling , a magnetically ordered ci with a very flat single - particle band emerges .",
    "doping this nearly flat band to fractional fillings was shown to give rise to fci states within the framework of an effective single - orbital model . here",
    ", we give a detailed account of the mapping onto the effective single - orbital model and show how such topologically nontrivial and nearly flat bands emerge in kondo - lattice and hubbard models both for the limit of infinite onsite interactions and for more realistic intermediate interaction strength .",
    "we then provide extensive numerical evidence , based on both eigenvalue spectra ( e.g. , ground - state degeneracy and spectral flow ) and eigenstate properties ( e.g. , many - body berry curvature and hall conductivity ) , for the existence of fci states in this model by using exact diagonalization .",
    "we discuss the robustness of fci states against disorder originating from single - site defects in the magnetic ordering , which will always occur in realistic situations .",
    "another very relevant issue in the context of fci states is their competition with other phases ,  @xcite e.g. symmetry - broken states such as a charge - density wave ( cdw ) .",
    "we study this issue by using a method that does not project onto the nearly flat chern band and thus keeps the effects of dispersion .",
    "the model considered in this work allows for a careful study of the competition between finite dispersion and interactions .",
    "we map out a phase diagram for filling fractions @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the latter case , filling permits a commensurate cdw , whereas in the former it does not .",
    "the cdw is favored by fermi - surface ( fs ) nesting , and we accordingly find the fci at @xmath4 to be far more stable when the bands are poorly nested .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "@xcite in this section , we first review the basic setup of the orbital symmetries in sec .",
    "[ sec : orbs ] and the modifications of the hopping through the magnetic order in sec .",
    "[ sec : berry ] , as we believe that it may be of value to the reader .",
    "after this presentation of the physical ingredients at work here , we discuss how the nearly flat @xmath9 band arises due to effective longer - range hoppings .",
    "after the simplest scenario of infinite hund s rule coupling in sec .",
    "[ sec : jinf ] , we go to the more realistic multi - orbital model with finite interactions in sec .  [",
    "sec : jfinite ] , and finally decide on a relatively simple effective model in sec .",
    "[ sec : eff_model ] , which nevertheless captures several important features .      in many transition - metal ( tm ) compounds ,",
    "the local symmetry around a tm ion is cubic , with ligand oxygens forming an octahedron , as depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : oct ] .",
    "this splits the degeneracy between the @xmath6 levels , because the two @xmath5 orbitals point toward the negatively charged oxygens , while the three @xmath0 levels have their lobes in between .",
    "consequently , the energy of @xmath5 levels is higher .",
    "depending on the total electron filling , the valence states may be found in either manifold .",
    "we are here discussing the situation where the three @xmath0 levels share @xmath10 to @xmath11 electrons and the @xmath5 levels are empty .",
    "furthermore , we consider the case of a layered triangular lattice , as can be realized in compounds of the form abo@xmath12 .    in this geometry ,",
    "the octahedra are edge sharing and electrons ( or holes ) can hop from one tm ion to its neighbor either through direct overlap or via the ligand oxygens .",
    "the hopping symmetries can be most easily worked out using the usual basis functions for the @xmath0 states , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15  @xcite and following refs .  .",
    "considering hopping for bonds along the @xmath16 direction and choosing the local coordinate system such that this corresponds to the @xmath17 direction in the @xmath18-@xmath19 plane , one finds that direct hopping @xmath20 is only relevant for the @xmath21 orbital and conserves orbital flavor . due to the @xmath22 angle of the tm - o - tm bond , oxygen - mediated hopping",
    "@xmath23 is , on the other hand , mostly via the oxygen-@xmath24 orbital and mediates processes between @xmath25 and @xmath26 states , thereby always _ changing _ orbital flavor .",
    "hoppings along the other two , symmetry - related , directions @xmath27 and @xmath28 are obtained by symmetry transformations .",
    "these hoppings can then be expressed in orbital- and direction- dependent matrix elements @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote orbitals ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath21 ) and @xmath32 the direction .",
    "they are given by @xmath33 for nn bonds along the three directions @xmath16 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the two hopping processes are expected to be of comparable strength , but with @xmath34 for @xmath35 elements , and will typically have opposite sign .",
    "@xcite    if the width of a triangular layer made of octahedra is compressed ( extended ) , the energy of the highly symmetric orbital state @xmath36 is raised ( lowered ) with respect to the remaining orbital doublet ( @xmath37 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : split ] for illustration .",
    "this energy shift can be written as @xmath38 and depends on the jahn - teller effect as well as on the lattice .",
    "@xcite especially for large splitting between @xmath9 and @xmath37 states , which may also be enhanced through onsite coulomb interactions , see sec .",
    "[ sec : jfinite ] , it is more appropriate to use a basis that reflects the triangular lattice symmetry .",
    "we thus go over into the @xmath39 basis , which is done via  @xcite @xmath40 the transformed hopping matrices @xmath41 are then obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hopp_xyz ] ) as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "observe that the intra - orbital hopping of the @xmath9 state is the same in all three lattice directions , as expected for @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "however , we also see that hopping elements mix all three orbitals .",
    "in addition to an orbital degree of freedom , we now consider coupling to a localized spin @xmath45 , modelled by a kondo - lattice model , where the kinetic energy is given by hopping elements @xmath29 taken from the matrices eq .",
    "( [ eq : hopp_xyz ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eq : hopp_a1g_eg ] ) .",
    "this situation is described by @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes nn bonds along the three directions @xmath32 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are orbital indices , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) annihilates ( creates ) an electron with spin @xmath50 in orbital @xmath30 at site @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the corresponding vector of orbital electronic spin operators .",
    "@xmath53 couples the itinerant electrons to a generic localized spin @xmath45 , the origin of which is left unspecified for the moment , but will be discussed extensively later .",
    "( it will turn out to be the spin degree of freedom of the @xmath0 electrons themselves , as in ref .  . )",
    "the coupling is assumed to be fm , as one would expect from hunds - rule coupling .",
    "however , we are furthermore going to consider @xmath54 as a _ classical _ spin , in which case afm coupling to @xmath45 would lead to the equivalent results .    for classical spins and large @xmath53 , it is convenient to go over to a _",
    "local _ spin - quantization axis , where `` @xmath55 '' ( ` @xmath56' ) refers to parallel ( antiparallel ) orientation of the electron s spin to the local axis .",
    "this simplifies the kondo term to @xmath57 where @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is the electron density at site @xmath60 in orbital @xmath30 with spin ( anti- ) parallel to the localized spin .",
    "this local spin definition is particularly convenient when going to the limit of large @xmath53 , where one immediately finds the low - energy states as given by only `` @xmath55 '' electrons .    on the other hand",
    ", the fact that the spin - quantization axis is not the same at all sites implies that the hopping no longer conserves the new spin .",
    "instead , hopping acquires as spin - dependent factor @xmath61 ,  @xcite with @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 and the set of angles @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the polar and azimuthal angles corresponding to @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "as one can see , these effective hoppings can become complex , and it has been shown that non - coplanar spin configurations can endow the electronic bands with a nontrivial topology.@xcite additionally , the itinerant electrons mediate an interaction between the localized spins , which typically competes with antiferromagnetic spin - spin interactions ; on frustrated lattices , this competition can resolve itself in non - coplanar  and thus topologically nontrivial ",

    "( [ eq : jt_xyz ] ) still gives a non - interacting model that can be easily solved in momentum space .",
    "one finds that large @xmath70 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : jt_xyz ] ) , strongly reduces the dispersion of one subband .",
    "@xcite this can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands_kondo ] , which shows the one - particle energies obtained on a cylinder .",
    "figure  [ fig : bands_kondo ] also reveals the edge states crossing some gaps , indicating the topologically nontrivial nature of these bands . calculating chern numbers @xmath71 corroborates this and gives @xmath72 .",
    "@xcite the band flatness can be expressed in terms of a figure of merit @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the two gaps separating the narrow band of interest from the other orbitals and from the subband with opposite chern number and @xmath76 is the width of the narrow band . as has been pointed out ,  @xcite the lower subband can here become very flat , and as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaps_kondo ] , the flatness can be further improved by going to larger crystal fields and reaches values @xmath77 .",
    "as these very flat bands can be achieved for large separation @xmath78 between the @xmath9 and @xmath37 states and as the band of interest then has almost purely @xmath9 character , it is natural to assume that one should be able to capture the most relevant processes with an effective @xmath9 model .",
    "( this is in contrast to the situation starting from @xmath5 orbitals , where one finds intermediate @xmath78 to be optimal .",
    "@xcite in that case , the nearly flat bands can only be obtained if _ both _ orbitals contribute weight and one can not easily reduce the situation to a one - band system . )",
    "the impact of the @xmath37 levels on the effective @xmath9 dispersion can be taken into account in second - order perturbation theory .",
    "this includes processes where a hole hops from the @xmath9 orbital at site @xmath51 to an @xmath37 state at @xmath79 and back again to an @xmath9 state at a third site @xmath80 , which may or may not be the same as @xmath51 .",
    "the denominator of these terms is the crystal - filed energy @xmath78 and the numerator is obtained from the products @xmath81 ( with @xmath82 designating @xmath9 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 the @xmath37 states ) . in order to evaluate the second - order hopping between sites @xmath51 and @xmath80 , these orbital hoppings have to be multiplied by the product of the berry phases @xmath85 and @xmath86 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hopp_chiral ] ) for all paths connecting @xmath51 and @xmath80 via one intermediate site @xmath87 . due to destructive interference , processes connecting nn and next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) sites cancel while effective third - neighbor hopping , where there is only one path , remains .",
    "since third - neighbor spins in the chiral phase are always parallel , the total berry phase of this process is 1 in all directions , however , the hopping via a spin of different orientation in the middle reduces the hopping amplitude by @xmath88 , leading to @xmath89 a third - neighbor hopping @xmath90 turns out to have almost the same dispersion as the chiral subbands and can consequently almost cancel it in one subband . as its strength can be tuned by @xmath91 and @xmath78 ,",
    "very flat subbands can be achieved , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gaps_kondo ] .      , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : merit ] ) , for finite hunds - rule coupling @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the bands designated as `` upper '' and `` lower '' refer to the two subbands of the @xmath9 states with spin parallel to the localized spin , which are separated by the gap opening in the spin - chiral phase , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bands_kondo].[fig : gapps_kondo ] ]    while the previous section has illustrated how one can understand the occurrence of nearly flat bands in a three - orbital double - exchange model , i.e. , for infinite hund s rule coupling to some localized spins , this section will discuss finite hund s rule .",
    "figure  [ fig : gapps_kondo ] shows the figure of merit for the band flatness eq .",
    "( [ eq : merit ] ) for a few sets of hopping parameters and for @xmath94 depending on hund s rule coupling @xmath53 to the localized spin , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : kondo_loc ] ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapps_kondo ] , the _ upper _ subband of the @xmath9 sector can now become nearly flat .",
    "( for @xmath95 , one can of course still find flat lower subbands , as discussed above . )",
    "the flatness of the upper subband can be explained by similar effective longer - range hoppings in second - order perturbation theory , this time also taking into account intermediate states with an electron in the upper kondo band , i.e. , with antiparallel spin .",
    "these additional terms can go either via the @xmath9 or via the @xmath37 orbitals and involve combined berry phases of the form @xmath96 .",
    "again , one has to sum over all possible intermediate sites @xmath79 and finds @xmath97 the nn , nnn and third - neighbor hoppings are here denoted by @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 give the excitation energies of the intermediate states with ( i ) a hole in the @xmath37 states with spin parallel , ( ii ) an electron in the @xmath9 states with spin anti - parallel and ( iii ) an electron in an @xmath37 state with spin anti - parallel .",
    "like the bare nn hopping , these effective hopping - matrix elements acquire an additional berry phase @xmath104 in the hamiltonian , which only depends on the relative orientation of spins on the initial and final sites .",
    "nnn hopping @xmath99 via the upper kondo band does not drop out , and nn hopping becomes renormalized .",
    "the flat chiral subbands that have been observed in a three - orbital @xmath0 hubbard model on the triangular lattice  @xcite arise in situations similar to the finite-@xmath53 scenario , and a mapping to the kondo - lattice model was shortly mentioned in the supplemental material of ref .  .",
    "the key point of the mapping is the observation that large crystal - field splitting @xmath78 , see ( [ eq : jt_xyz ] ) , leads to an orbital - selective mott insulator , where the @xmath37 levels are half filled and far from the fermi level , while the states near the fermi level have almost only @xmath9 character .",
    "the orbital degree of freedom is consequently quenched , because orbital occupations are already fully determined .",
    "a charge degree of freedom remains , as the @xmath9 orbital contains one electron per two sites .",
    "charge fluctuations of the half - filled @xmath5 levels , however , are suppressed due to the large mott gap between their occupied and empty states . they can thus be described as a spin degrees of freedom , and the situation is further simplified , because they form a total spin with @xmath105 due to hund s rule . the @xmath9 electron is likewise coupled via fm hund s rule to this spin .",
    "this situation  mobile carriers coupled via fm hund s rule to localized spin degrees of freedom  is captured by a fm kondo - lattice model .",
    "these considerations can be cast in a more formal setting starting from the mean - field decoupling  @xcite of the onsite coulomb repulsion . the full interaction for equivalent",
    "@xmath0 orbitals reads @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 holds in the case of equivalent @xmath0 orbitals .",
    "we now concentrate on the regime of interest , where the @xmath9 orbital is separated from the @xmath5 doublet by a sizable @xmath109 and does not have to be equivalent . as long as intraorbital interaction ( [ eq : intra ] ) and hund s rule coupling ( [ eq : hund ] ) dominate over interorbital interaction ( [ eq : inter ] ) and crystal - field splitting ( [ eq : jt_xyz ] ) , doubly occupied orbitals will be suppressed and the last term ( [ eq : pair ] ) will consequently not be important . moreover , there is no reason for spins in different orbitals , but on the same site , to point in different directions , as the only interactions between spins are fm , i.e. , we can use the same local quantization axis for all orbitals . in the case of doubly occupied orbitals ,",
    "one spin can be seen as lying antiparallel and as introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : berry ] , `` @xmath55 '' ( `` @xmath56 '' ) denotes a spin parallel ( antiparallel ) to the local quantization axis . the corresponding mean - field decoupling is @xmath110 where @xmath71 is a constant  @xcite and @xmath111 . due to the last term ( [ eq : hundmf ] ) , an electron in orbital @xmath31 feels a fm coupling to a `` classical localized spin '' with length @xmath112 that points along the local quantization axis .",
    "the axis can be parametrized by angles @xmath113 and @xmath114 , which establishes the relation to sec .",

    ": @xmath117    finally , we note that the fact that onsite interactions @xmath118 and @xmath119 are only large , but _ not _ infinite , is important for the spin - chiral ground state : for very large @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the ground state becomes a ferromagnet .",
    "@xcite this can be related to the fact that the kondo - lattice model requires either finite @xmath53  @xcite or additional afm inter - site superexchange  @xcite to support a spin - chiral instead of a fm state . at finite onsite interactions , virtual excitations with doubly occupied @xmath37 orbitals",

    "such a process yields an energy gain @xmath121 and is only possible if the spins of the two involved electrons , which occupy the same orbital in the intermediate state , are opposite .",
    "the mechanism thus effectively provides the needed afm intersite superexchange and the spin - chiral state becomes stable for wide parameter regimes , including ranges supporting nearly flat upper chiral subbands .",

    "a few more comments on the phase diagram have to be made .",
    "ideally , a ground - state property would be used to determine the phase boundaries .",
    "one such property , which is sensitive to phase transitions , is the ground - state fidelity , defined as a measure of the overlap @xmath209 , where @xmath210 is the ground - state wave function and @xmath30 is a control parameter varied in small steps @xmath211 .",
    "phase transitions are then marked by a divergence in the fidelity at the transition point .",
    "having calculated the ground - state fidelity upon varying interaction strength and band flatness for the cases presented here , we find that such divergences occur only at points where ground - state level crossings also occur , so the fidelity does not provide any extra information compared to the eigenvalue spectra .",
    "furthermore , it has recently been shown that the fidelity on finite systems can fail to register topological phase transitions , e.g. , between a fqh - like state and a fermi liquid .",
    "based on an earlier investigation ,  @xcite we have illustrated extensively how fci states can emerge in a strongly correlated multiorbital model and have shown how an effective spinless one - orbital model with nearly flat bands and non - zero chern number @xmath1 arises as the the low - energy limit of kondo - lattice and hubbard models for @xmath0 orbitals on a triangular lattice .",
    "nn coulomb interaction @xmath2 then stabilizes states with all the characteristics of fci states : the lowest eigenvalues have a near degeneracy corresponding to the denominator of the filling fraction and show spectral flow without closing of the energy gap .",
    "we have , moreover , demonstrated that the states of the ground - state manifold of this phase have a non - zero hall conductivity , which is shown to be precisely quantized and equal to the filling fraction , in units of @xmath159 .",
    "the exact quantization of the hall conductivity holds also when fci states are not ground states , and survives when the many - body berry curvature is not a particularly flat function .",
    "deviating from the exact filling fraction @xmath3 by either removing electrons or increasing the system size , we found indications of fractional quasihole statistics in the eigenvalue spectra , by application of the state - counting rule elaborated in ref .  .",
    "the eigenvalue spectra contain features that remind one of both the hierarchy and the composite fermion pictures of fqh states , therefore pushing the correspondence between fci and fqh states one step further .    since in the present context",
    "the magnetic texture is generated by strongly correlated itinerant electrons , imperfections in this texture are to be expected .",
    "we therefore investigate the impact of a localized impurity that mixes states across momentum sectors .",
    "disorder causes splitting of the energy levels corresponding to the degenerate fci ground states , thus making these states inequivalent in finite systems .",
    "however , the gap between these states and the excited - state spectrum remains open and their average hall conductivity remains accurately fixed to the value of the filling fraction , even though the hall conductivities of the individual states deviate from that value .",
    "this behavior illustrates the topological protection of the fci states .",
    "finally , we address the robustness of fci states with respect to band flatness , interaction strength , filling and fs nesting .",
    "very flat bands indeed turn out to require the weakest interaction to produce an fci state , corroborating the figure of merit @xmath132 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : merit ] ) ] as a good first step in assessing candidate systems .",
    "as soon as one deviates from this limit , however , additional properties of the system become crucial : in contrast to a perfectly flat ll , strong particle - hole asymmetry can arise on a lattice , because some fillings allow cdws more easily than others .",
    "in addition , a cdw is favored by fs nesting and this in turn reduces the stability range of the fci states .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that fci states can be obtained if either of the following conditions is met : ( i ) very flat bands , even near nesting and at a filling favorable to a cdw , and ( ii ) even rather dispersive bands , if the filling fraction or the absence of fs nesting are unfavorable to a cdw .",

    "<S> we discuss the low - energy limit of three - orbital kondo - lattice and hubbard models describing @xmath0 orbitals on a triangular lattice near half - filling . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze how very flat single - particle bands with non - trivial topological character , a chern number @xmath1 , arise both in the limit of infinite on - site interactions as well as in more realistic regimes . </S>",
    "<S> exact diagonalization is then used to investigate an effective one - orbital spinless - fermion model at fractional fillings including nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath2 ; it reveals signatures of fractional chern insulator ( fci ) states for several filling fractions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to indications based on energies , e.g. flux insertion and fractional statistics of quasiholes , chern numbers are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that fci states are robust against disorder in the underlying magnetic texture that defines the topological character of the band . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate competition between a fci state and a charge density wave ( cdw ) and discuss the effects of particle - hole asymmetry and fermi - surface nesting . </S>",
    "<S> fci states turn out to be rather robust and do not require very flat bands , but can also arise when filling or an absence of fermi - surface nesting disfavor the competing cdw . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , very flat bands allow fci states to be induced by weaker interactions than those needed for more dispersive bands . </S>"
