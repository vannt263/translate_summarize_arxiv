    "in a recent paper braginsky _ et al_@xcite , henceforth bgv , considered the noise in interferometric gravitational - wave detectors due to thermoelastic fluctuations of the mirrors attached to the test masses of the interferometer .",
    "these thermoelastic fluctuations have contributions from two independent processes , both acting via the thermal expansivity of the mirror substrate material .",
    "the first one is the _ thermodynamic _ fluctuations in temperature of the body of the mirror substrate ( these , in the approximation of small thermal expansion , are independent from the thermodynamic fluctuations in volume , which are responsible for the well studied _ thermal _ or _ brownian _",
    "noise@xcite ) .",
    "the second one is the _ photothermal _ temperature fluctuations due to the fact that the number of photons absorbed by the mirror fluctuate .",
    "bgv results for the thermodynamic noise , obtained for half - infinite mirrors , have been extended to the case of finite size mirrors@xcite , with particular reference to the design of advanced interferometric gravitational - wave detectors , such as ligoii@xcite . in both cases the calculations",
    "are concerned with mirrors at room temperature , made of materials well in use for mirrors substrates as fused silica and sapphire , with km long fabry - perot cavities , which are characterized by laser beam spots of size @xmath0 and comparatively low finesse @xmath1 , and with characteristic frequencies @xmath2 , for the mechanical motion to be monitored optically .",
    "there are a number of situations , at variance with the above , which are of interest for optomechanical devices . in such situations",
    "one or both of the thermoelastic fluctuations effects may be of concern , when one would like to reach , in the measurements of small displacement , the so called _ standard quantum limit _",
    "( sql)@xcite . already for ligoii",
    ", bgv seems to discourage , in favour of fused silica , the use of sapphire , which on the other hand may be the material considered for _ cold mirrors _ in connection with advanced configurations of interferometric gravitational - wave detectors , under study as lcgt@xcite , ligoiii @xcite and euro@xcite",
    ".    the bgv effects would be of concern for very sensitive displacement sensors based on high - finesse fabry - perot cavities , to be used in connection with bar detectors of gravitational waves as dual cavity transducers@xcite , or to study the quantum effects of radiation pressure@xcite .  in both cases",
    "the cavities are much shorter ( less than a few centimeter ) than in a gravitational - wave interferometer , the beam spots are smaller ( @xmath3 ) , finesses much larger ( @xmath4 ) and temperatures as low as @xmath5 .",
    "it may appear from bgv results that the thermoelastic effects would generate particularly large effects , inasmuch the volume involved in the fluctuation processes would be correspondingly smaller .    for these reasons , it is of interest to explore what would be the behaviour of both thermoelastic effects in the low temperatures and small beam spot regimes , where some bgv assumptions break down .",
    "in particular , the heat diffusion length @xmath6 depends on the temperature and can become larger than the laser beam spot dimension @xmath7 , so that the adiabatic approximation is no longer valid .    in section [ heatpropag ]",
    "we give the essentials of the regime of phonons and heat propagation , which establishes at low enough temperatures , and we evaluate the thermoelastic noises with a simple calculation , in relation to the beam spot size and to the frequencies at which the optomechanical device is most sensitive .    in sections [ thermodynamic ] and [ photothermal ] we give an exact calculation of both thermoelastic effects in the whole region of interest , that is for any value of the ratio @xmath8 .",
    "the results , under the assumptions of low temperature regime of section [ heatpropag ] , would directly apply to actual mirrors for the quoted optomechanical devices .",
    "we also relate in a general way the photothermal noise to the displacement noise induced on the mirror by the quantum fluctuations of radiation pressure in the cavity .    in section [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss limitations and relevance of our approach in the design of the sql optomechanical displacement devices .",
    "let us assume the optomechanical device to work in some frequency range centered around a frequency @xmath9 and let us discuss the photothermal effect .",
    "we revisit the calculation of bgv in the following way , so to use it to see the regime which sets up at low temperatures .",
    "the multilayers coating of the mirror absorbs a small fraction of the light power and this induces an inhomogeneous increase of the temperature of the bulk .",
    "the absorbed power is a poisson distributed random variable ( the statistics of the absorbed photon will be discussed in more details in section [ photothermal ] ) , and these fluctuations lead to thermal fluctuations in the bulk of the mirror .",
    "they are consequently responsible for fluctuations of the position of the reflecting face of the mirror , via the thermal expansion of the mirror material .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "displacement noise of the mirror end face @xmath10 is found by evaluating the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation in temperature @xmath11 , in a volume @xmath12 of the mirror of thickness @xmath13 , linear thermal expansion coefficient @xmath14 and specific thermal capacity @xmath15 , as the absorbed photon flux @xmath16 fluctuates , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy per photon , @xmath19 is the r.m.s .  poissonian fluctuation of the number of photons absorbed over the time @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the average absorbed photon flux ) , and @xmath22 is the density of the mirror material ( axis @xmath13 is taken normal to the plane face of the mirror ) .    at room temperature and for large beam spots , bgv conditions apply : the phonon mean free path and relaxation times are very small respectively in comparison to the mirror coating thickness ( where the photons create the phonons in the absorption process ) , and in comparison with the characteristic time @xmath20 .",
    "the thermal diffusion length at frequency @xmath9 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the thermal conductivity .",
    "for a frequency @xmath9 around @xmath25 , @xmath6 is on one hand larger than the coating thickness @xmath26 , and on the other hand much smaller than the beam spot radius @xmath7 , @xmath27 this is the basic bgv approximation , which gives that the volume involved in the fluctuating thermal expansion effect is the fraction of mirror substrate @xmath28 and thus one has @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_deltax ] ) .",
    "this argument reproduces the essential features of bgv spectral density @xmath30 $ ] of photothermal displacement noise , as one may write around the frequency @xmath9 , @xmath31 \\simeq \\frac{\\delta z^{2}}{f}\\simeq \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha   } { \\rho cr_{0}^{2}}\\right ) ^{2}\\frac{s_{abs}}{f^{2 } } ,   \\label{eq_sxxp}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the spectral power noise of the absorbed light , with @xmath33 the average absorbed light power .",
    "in fact we see that eq .",
    "( [ eq_sxxp ] ) is the same final bgv relation ( eq .  8 of @xcite ) , apart from a term with the poisson ratio of the mirror material and numerical factors .",
    "the condition ( [ eq_ltcond ] ) may break down for small beam spot radius @xmath34 or for low temperature @xmath35 , as the thermal diffusion length gets longer , either in the mirror substrate or in the mirror coating or in both .    for mirrors substrates of crystalline materials , as specifically sapphire , for a frequency @xmath36 , the thermal length @xmath37 in the substrate at low temperature",
    "gets of the order of @xmath38 , to be compared with a room temperature value @xmath39 ( see table [ table_1 ] ) .",
    "then at low temperature we rather have @xmath40 at all frequencies below some @xmath41 , both for mirrors of gravitational - wave interferometers ( for which @xmath42 ) , and for optomechanical sensors ( for which @xmath43 ) .",
    "this value for @xmath44 stays constant in the whole region @xmath45 , as crystalline materials follow debye @xmath46 laws for @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath47 , and thus their ratios are all independent of @xmath48    .thermal properties of fused silica ( top ) and sapphire ( bottom ) at different temperatures . the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath49 , thermal conductivity @xmath50 , thermal capacity @xmath51 and phonon mean free path @xmath52 are derived from@xcite at room temperature , and from@xcite at low temperatures .",
    "the thermal length @xmath6 at @xmath41 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq_lt ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we first focus on the thermodynamic noise whose values calculated from eq .",
    "( [ suomega2 ] ) are shown in the third lines of tables [ table_2 ] .",
    "the noise is smaller than the one which would be obtained within the adiabatic approximation ( last lines in tables [ table_2 ] ) .",
    "the reduction factor , equal to @xmath53 $ ] , can be as large as @xmath54 for sapphire at low temperature with @xmath55 , and as large as @xmath56 for @xmath57 ( second lines in tables [ table_2 ] ) .",
    "we immediately see the impact for gravitational - wave interferometers ( @xmath55 ) : for sapphire at low temperature , the thermodynamic noise is more than 4 order of magnitude smaller than for fused silica , so that the choice of the material at low temperature would be just the opposite than , as in bgv , at room temperature .",
    "furthermore , the thermodynamic noise at @xmath58 would be equal to @xmath59 for sapphire at low temperature , well below the noise at room temperature ( @xmath60 for fused silica ) .",
    "it is also well below the sql limit due to the external pendulum motion , equal to @xmath61 for a mirror mass of @xmath62@xcite .",
    "similarly for optomechanical systems with smaller beam spot size ( @xmath63 ) , the thermodynamic noise can be made as small as @xmath64 by using sapphire at low temperature , to be compared to a noise larger than @xmath65 at room temperature both for sapphire and fused silica .",
    "it is worth noticing that this very low value is partly due to the reduction factor associated with the non adiabaticity which is of the order of @xmath56 .",
    "this noise can be compared to the sqllimit due to the internal motion of the mirror , which is equal to @xmath66@xcite . at low temperature ,",
    "the thermodynamic noise is thus smaller than the sql  limit so that optomechanical sensors as in refs .",
    "@xcite would be able to get to the sql  limit .",
    "let us note that the thermodynamic noise for sapphire at @xmath67 is mostly independent of the beam spot size @xmath7 : similar values are obtained for large spot sizes ( @xmath59 for @xmath55 ) and small ones ( @xmath64 for @xmath57 ) .",
    "this result is due to the fact that , in contrast with fused silica , the adiabatic approximation is not valid for sapphire whatever the beam spot size is , as long as it is smaller than a few centimeters . the non adiabatic condition @xmath68 can actually be written as @xmath69 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq_defomegac ] ) . in this non adiabatic regime , we have shown that @xmath70 $ ] evolves as @xmath71 which is proportional to @xmath72 and then to @xmath73 .",
    "the thermodynamic noise is proportional to @xmath74 $ ] ( eq .",
    "[ suomega2 ] ) and is then independent of @xmath7 .",
    "similar results can be obtained for the photothermal noise .",
    "we have shown that as long as the adiabatic condition is not satisfied , the noise mostly depends on the ratio @xmath75 ( eqs . [ eq_sxxp3 ] or [ su(w)2 ] ) .",
    "in particular it does not depend on the frequency @xmath76 nor on the beam spot size @xmath7 . for sapphire at low temperature and for an average absorbed power @xmath77 of nd - yag laser light ,",
    "the photothermal noise is then of the order of @xmath78 both for interferometers and optomechanical sensors , well below the sql limits of both the external and internal motions .",
    "let us finally note that the results obtained above apply in detail to an actual mirror system when the conditions described in section [ heatpropag ] are fulfilled . in particular the interplay of the various characteristic lengths ( phonon mean free path and thermal lengths at the frequencies of interest , both in the substrate and in the coating , beam spot , coating thickness and mirror size ) must in the end allow , in some temperature range , that the thermal properties of the substrate dominate .    this may be not easy to achieve and thus our analysis may correspond to a somewhat idealized situation .",
    "at the lowest temperatures @xmath79 , the phonon mean free path in the coating gets of the order of its thickness ( as for an amorphous silica coating , see for example @xcite ) , while the time constants for phonon local equilibrium continue to stay smaller than @xmath80 both for the coating and the substrate . at first sight",
    ", it may appear that the equalization of coating versus substrate temperatures will be even more facilitated .",
    "however at some intermediate temperature below @xmath81 the phonon mean free path in substrates like sapphire may get so long to exceed the dimensions of the mirror .",
    "in this case a more ad hoc model has to be considered , in which one specifies the details of the thermal link of the mirror to the main heat sink .",
    "similar care should be taken if the thermal length at the lowest frequency of interest is of the order of the mirror size . possibly in both cases",
    "the effect would be smaller than predicted in this paper , because the characteristic times for thermal equilibrium in the mirror volume would get even shorter .",
    "in any case , as to quote just one instance , phonon mean free paths and thermal conductivities ( and thus thermal lengths ) , have strong dependencies at low temperatures on the level of impurities , so that each experimental configuration may be a case per se .    in conclusion our results may be possibly of interest in two respects .",
    "first because they let see promising the use of low temperatures both for gravitational - wave interferometers and for optomechanical devices .",
    "second because they may be of help to study , in actual experimental configurations for sql conditions , the role of the thermoelastic effects in respect to choices of substrate materials , working temperatures , cavity finesses , mirrors losses , beam spot sizes and laser powers .",
    "after the completion of this work , we learned that results for the photothermal effect similar to those of section [ photothermal ] were obtained with a different method@xcite , that the problem of section [ thermodynamic ] has been addressed heuristically with conclusions in part similar @xcite , and that a calculation of thermoelastic effects due to photon absorption in the bulk of cryogenic crystallin cavities@xcite was also having similar features .",

    "in this appendix , we calculate the spectral density @xmath82 $ ] ( eq . [ suomega1 ] ) of the spatially averaged displacement @xmath83 induced by the thermodynamic noise .",
    "we approximate the mirror as an infinite half space ( @xmath84 ) . at the zeroth order in the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath85 , the solution @xmath86 of the quasistatic stress balance equation ( [ staticstressbalance ] )",
