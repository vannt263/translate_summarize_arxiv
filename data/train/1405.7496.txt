    "in spite of tremendous success of observational cosmology , reached over the past quarter century , many issues regarding the nature of dark matter and its distribution in the universe relative to the visible ( stellar ) matter still remain unresolved .",
    "numerous studies ( karachentsev 1966 , rood et al .",
    "1970 , bahcall et al .",
    "2000 ) have shown that in groups and clusters of galaxies the ratio of dark ( virial ) mass to stellar mass systematically increases with size and population of a given system of galaxies . in the richest clusters , such as the coma",
    ", the @xmath3 ratio reaches up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "if all the galaxies are part of clusters , dark matter associated with them would provide the average density of matter in space amounting to @xmath4 ( bahcall & kulier , 2014 ) , corresponding to the standard cosmological @xmath5cdm model ( spergel et al . 2007 ) .",
    "however , no more than 10% of all galaxies belong to rich clusters ( libeskind et al , 2013 , cautun et al . 2014 ) .",
    "most of them are included in groups of different multiplicity , which are concentrated in the filaments and `` sheets '' , forming a large - scale `` cosmic web '' ( bond et al .",
    "1996 , shandarin et al .",
    "2004 , einasto et al .",
    "looking at the data on 11000 galaxies of the nearby universe with radial velocities @xmath6  km@xmath7s@xmath8 , makarov & karachentsev ( 2011 ) have identified in this volume about 400 groups and clusters of galaxies and determined their virial masses .",
    "the summation of virial masses of groups and clusters in the volume of @xmath950  mpc radius led to the average density estimate of @xmath1(local)@xmath10 , which is three times lower than the global cosmic density .",
    "this result confirmed the earlier estimates of @xmath11 ) , which were obtained for the local universe by vennik ( 1984 ) , tully ( 1987 ) , magtesian ( 1988 ) and other authors .",
    "a threefold difference between the estimates of @xmath1(local ) and @xmath1(global ) did not cause much concern among theorists .",
    "it was considered quite obvious that dark matter is not distributed in clusters and groups with the same concentration as stellar matter ( biasing effect ) .",
    "darker peripheries of the clusters probably contain a large amount of dark matter , the presence of which eliminates the paradox of `` missing dark matter '' .",
    "the assumption of massive dark halos existing around the clusters and groups of galaxies is not , however , confirmed by the observations .",
    "investigating the hubble flow of galaxies around the virgo , the nearest cluster of galaxies , karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2014b ) showed that the total mass of the cluster , determined from the external motions of galaxies is in a good agreement with the virial mass estimate based on the motions within the cluster .",
    "since the total mass of the virgo cluster was estimated on a scale of the `` zero velocity sphere '' radius , @xmath2 , which is @xmath93.7 times larger than the virial radius @xmath12 , this result gives evidence against the localization of a significant amount of dark matter in the layer between @xmath12 and @xmath2 .",
    "a similar situation occurs around the local group of galaxies ( karachentsev et al .",
    "consequently , we should be on the outlook for other ideas and observational data to resolve the paradox of missing dark matter .    the recently published `` updated nearby galaxy catalog '' = ungc , ( karachentsev et al . , 2013 ) contains a summary of data on radial velocities , distances and other observable parameters of about 800 galaxies located within a 11  mpc radius around us .",
    "more than 300 galaxies of this sample have accurate distance measurements with a better than 10% accuracy obtained by the tip of the red giant branch from observations with the hubble space telescope . due to the proximity of the ungc- objects , the kinematic data density in the catalog proves to be 6 times higher than in the sample of the nearby ( @xmath13 mpc ) universe ( makarov & karachentsev , 2011 , hereafter mk11 ) .",
    "this circumstance , and the presence of individual distance measurements in many ungc galaxies allows us to investigate the structure of nearby groups and their vicinities with unprecedented detail . determining the masses of the most nearby galaxies from the motions of their companions is the main subject of this paper .",
    "to determine the mass of a system of n point - like bodies , one usually uses the virial theorem in the form of @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gravitational constant , @xmath16 is the velocity dispersion on the line of sight , @xmath17 is the average harmonic separation between the group members in the projection on the sky , and @xmath18 is the average projection factor at arbitrary group orientation with respect to the line of sight ( bahcall & tremaine , 1981 ) .",
    "but this estimator is statistically offset and inefficient .",
    "therefore , heisler et al . ( 1985 ) proposed to estimate the mass of a group in a more robust way :    @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the so - called `` projected '' mass , n is the number of objects , and @xmath21 is the average product of squared radial velocity of the component relative to the group center , and its projection separation from the center .",
    "both these mass estimators presume spherical symmetry of the groups as well as isotropic velocity distribution .",
    "but as shown by wojtak ( 2013 ) many groups are highly aspherical , with shapes approximately by nearly prolate ellipsoids .",
    "according to wojtak ( 2013 ) their mean spatial axial ratio is @xmath22 and the mean axial ratio of the velocity ellipsoids is @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , simulated dark matter haloes tend to be aligned with the cosmic web in the way that the semi - major axis is aligned with the local filaments and the semi - minor axis is pointing to neighbouring voids ( libeskind et al .",
    "being mostly located in the local sheet , the nearby groups may be preferentially observed along their major or median axis that would have any effect on the mass estimates .",
    "if the group is dominated by a massive galaxy , surrounded by a set of test particles with random orientation of their orbits , one can use the `` orbital '' mass estimate ( karachentsev , 2005 ) :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the velocity difference and the projected separation of companions relative to the main galaxy , and @xmath27 is the prevailing orbit eccentricity . assuming the typical eccentricity value of @xmath28 ( barber et al .",
    "2014 ) , we get    @xmath29    for completeness , we also mention another approach to mass estimation proposed by beloborodov & levin ( 2004 ) . based on the natural assumption that companions of the main galaxy are observed at random orbital phase moments",
    ", they offered so - called `` orbital roulette estimator ''    @xmath30    which uses just the same obervables , but yields at @xmath31 the mass estimate 21% smaller than ( 4 ) .",
    "note that at @xmath32 the projected mass estimate ( 2 ) coincides with the orbital estimate ( 4 ) .",
    "we will use the orbital mass estimator further on .",
    "possessing the data on the distances and luminosities of 869 galaxies of the local volume , karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have determined for each galaxy its tidal index    @xmath33+c , \\,\\,\\ , n=1 , 2 , ... n , \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the stellar mass of the neighboring galaxy , and @xmath35 is its spatial separation from the considered galaxy .",
    "the stellar mass of the galaxy was assumed to be equal to its k - band luminosity at @xmath36 ( bell et al , 2003 ) .",
    "ranking the surrounding galaxies by the magnitude of their tidal force , @xmath37 , allowed to find the most influential neighbor , called the main disturber (= md ) . here",
    "the ratio of the total mass of the galaxy to its stellar mass was considered to be constant regardless of the luminosity and morphology of galaxies .",
    "the constant c = -10.96 in equation ( 6 ) was chosen so that the galaxy with @xmath38 was located at the `` zero velocity sphere '' relative to its md .",
    "in other words , the galaxy with @xmath39 was regarded as causally ( gravitationally ) related to its md as their crossing time was shorter than the age of the universe , @xmath40 gyr .",
    "consequently , the causally unrelated galaxies with @xmath41 were referred to as the population of `` general field '' .",
    "obviously , the galaxies which have a common md can be combined in a certain association , or a md `` suite '' . at that",
    ", an aggregate of suite members with positive @xmath42 values is quite consistent with the notion of a physically bound group of galaxies .",
    "karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2014a ) have analyzed different properties of galaxies in the suites , as well as properties of their main galaxies .",
    "as expected , the most massive mds possess the most populous suites .",
    "the total number of companions around 15 most massive galaxies makes up about a half of the total population of the local volume .",
    "the full list of suites , ranked by the number of suite members from n = 53 to n = 1 is presented in table 1 ( karachentsev et al .",
    "the table 5 ( appendix ) below presents the summary of 15 richest groups ( suites ) of the local volume , in which at least 6 galaxies have measured radial velocities .",
    "we did not include in the table 5 those members of suites , which radial velocities remain still unmeasured .",
    "these cases consist of about 1/3 of the total amount of suite members .",
    "the heading line of each suite presents : the name of the main disturber , its distance in mpc , its stellar mass and the value of orbital mass with the standard error .",
    "the suites ( groups ) are arranged in the descending order of their total population .",
    "the following is given for the members of each suite : ( 1 ) name of the galaxy in ungc catalog ; ( 2 ) the tidal index @xmath42 by which the members of the suite are ranked ; ( 3 ) projection separation of the suite member from the md in kpc , assuming that all the companions of the md are at the same distance from the observer as the md itself ; ( 4 ) absolute value of the radial velocity difference of member of the suite and the md in km / s .",
    "the distribution of 351 companions by the radial velocity difference and projection separation relative to their main galaxies is presented in three panels of fig.1 .",
    "the upper panel of the figure shows the \\{@xmath43 } diagram for 31 companions of the milky way = mw ( squares ) and 39 members of the m  31 = andromeda suite ( diamonds ) .",
    "the companions of massive galaxies with the tidal index @xmath44 , considered to be physical , are represented by closed symbols , while the members of the suites with @xmath45 are shown by the open symbols .",
    "the extension of the companion sample by the objects with slightly negative values of @xmath42 was done not to miss some possible physical members of the group , in which the distances are as yet measured with low accuracy .",
    "the objects in this boundary category may appear to be both the real companions of main galaxies or belong to the population of general field .",
    "note that for the mw companions we are not listing the spatial distances , but their projection on the plane perpendicular to the line of sight towards the mw center .",
    "the middle panel of fig.1 shows the \\{@xmath43 } distribution for 174 members of rich suites around 13 other massive nearby galaxies .",
    "prospective physical companions with @xmath46 ( n=142 ) are also marked here by solid symbols .",
    "in addition to 15 rich suites , the local volume comprises a lot of small suites , where the radial velocities are measured in one or several presumed companions .",
    "we have combined these small suites in a composite ( `` synthetic '' ) suite . the \\{@xmath43 } diagram for 107 companions uniting small suites",
    "is represented on the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 . at that",
    ", we only kept the cases where the stellar mass of companion does not exceed half the mass of the main galaxy .",
    "the dashed lines in all the three panels of fig.1 show quadratic regressions of the velocity difference on the projection separation of companions . for the suites of galaxies around mw and m31",
    ", the regression has a negative slope .",
    "while for the synthetic suite of 142 companions around the 13 most massive galaxies and for the synthetic suite , uniting small suites , regressions show a weak increase in velocity dispersion from the center to the suite periphery . different behavior of the regressions may indicate the atypical character of motion of the mw and m31 companions in comparison to the suites of other massive nearby galaxies .",
    "another reason of the rising part of the velocity dispersion may be caused by the presence of large scale halo when nearby groups are a part of larger structure , the local sheet , which would give rise to the observed enhancement of the velocity dispersion at large radii .",
    "however , a more obvious reason for this phenomenon is caused by the presence on the suite outskirts of an admixture of some false members entering the suites from the general field .",
    "the basic characteristics of the considered suites are presented in table 1 .",
    "its columns contain : ( 1 ) name of the suite / group by its main galaxy , ( 2 ) the number of physical ( @xmath46 ) members of the group with measured radial velocities , ( 3 ) the average projection separation of the companions from the main galaxy ( kpc ) , ( 4 ) the mean absolute value of the radial velocity difference of the companions relative to the main galaxy ( km / s ) , ( 5 ) the main galaxy stellar mass in the units of @xmath47 , ( 6 ) the value of orbital mass of the group ( suite ) in the units of @xmath48 and its standard error coming from the error of the mean in equation ( 4 ) .",
    "the location of suites in table 1 corresponds to their breakdown in the three panels of fig .",
    "1 : the first lines contain the data for the mw and m31 groups , followed by the characteristics of 13 other most populated groups of the local volume , and the end of the table shows the average parameters of composite suite . since the main galaxies in the composite suite significantly differ by their stellar mass , we have divided the synthetic suite into three subsamples having about the same number of companions with measured radial velocities .",

    "2014 ) , as given by equation ( 41 ) and figure 8 in lokas & mamon ( 2001 ) .",
    "modeling the structure and kinematics of galaxy groups within the @xmath5cdm paradigm , many authors ( libeskind et al . 2010 , zavala et al . 2009 , knebe et al . 2011 ) choose the local group to make a comparison with the observational data .",
    "as known , the local group has two gravitating centers : the mw and m31 , which are approaching each other with mutual velocity of about 110 km / s .",
    "this binary character is not an exclusive feature .",
    "for example , the neighboring groups : m81 and ngc  2403 , ic  342 and maffei  i , ngc  5128 and ngc  5236 also belong to the class of binary merging groups . but from the standpoint of the group mass estimate from the orbital motions of the companions , the listed galaxies have to be considered as standalone dynamical centers .",
    "previously karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2014a ) noted that judging on some morphological features the groups of galaxies around the mw and m31 are not quite typical .",
    "this primarily refers to the presence near the mw of two companions ( magellanic clouds ) rich in gas .",
    "there are also other features that distinguish the mw and m31 groups among other nearby ones .",
    "six histograms of fig.3 represent the distributions of 15 most populated suites in the local volume based on the following parameters : the average projected separation of the companions from the main galaxy , @xmath53 , the mean absolute value of the radial velocity difference of the companion and the main galaxy , the logarithm of stellar mass of the md , the md orbital mass , the ratio of the orbital mass - to - sum of stellar masses of all the galaxies in the group , @xmath54 , and the average crossing time @xmath55 for the suite members , where @xmath56 is expressed in terms of the age of the universe , @xmath40 gyr .",
    "the groups of galaxies around the mw and andromeda are marked with `` m '' and `` a '' , respectively .    according to these data ,",
    "the linear dimension of the suites around mw and m31 are approximately 2 times less extended than the typical suite of other neighboring massive galaxies . in the case of mw , that can be caused by the obvious selection effect : most of the recently discovered ultra - low luminosity companions of the mw were found at the distances of less than 100 kpc ( willman et al . 2005 , belokurov et al .",
    "2006 ) . to some extent ,",
    "the small linear size of the suite of companions around m31 can also be caused by a selection effect , since the most thorough search for new companions was carried out in a limited region around m31 ( ibata et al .",
    "2007 , martin et al .",
    ". however , the most plausible explanation of this difference may also be the presence in the suites of neighboring massive galaxies of a certain number of false members , which appear on the periphery of the suites from the general field .",
    "in contrast to the linear dimensions , radial velocity dispersion for the companions of mw and m31 does not stand out among the other groups ( panel `` b '' ) .",
    "the `` c '' histogram data show that based on their stellar masses , both mw and m31 do not get in the top ten most massive galaxies of the local volume .",
    "this may be also the reason of understated linear dimensions of the suites around the mw and m31 .",
    "the `` d '' and `` e '' histograms show the distribution of 15 suites by the orbital mass and by the ratio of the orbital mass - to - sum of stellar masses of the group members , respectively .",
    "the two groups located most rightward on these panels correspond to the suite around ngc  4594 ( `` sombrero '' ) and the group ngc  3368/3379 ( leo  i ) .",
    "if in the distribution of suites by the value of @xmath57 both groups mw and m31 are shifted towards the lower values relative to the average , whereas based on the @xmath54 parameter , both groups are not significantly different from the rest .",
    "the lower panel of fig.3 shows the distribution of suites by the average crossing time of the companions .",
    "a typical dynamic situation in the group of the local volume is expressed by the fact that the companions of massive galaxies have time to make about 5 oscillations around the center , which is sufficient for the group to get virialized .",
    "two suites on the right side of the histogram with @xmath58 are the scattered groups around ngc  253 ( the sculptor filament ) and ngc  4736 ( the cvn  i cloud ) , the dynamical relaxation of which has apparently not yet achieved .",
    "as noted above , the formation of suites around the nearby galaxies was made based on the data on mutual separations and stellar masses ( @xmath59-luminosities ) of galaxies in the local volume .",
    "radial velocities of galaxies were not taken into account here . among @xmath60 groups from the list of mk11",
    "there are fairly nearby groups falling into the local volume . in 18 of them",
    "the number of members with known radial velocities is not too small @xmath61 to estimate the projected mass of the group with an acceptable statistical error .",
    "the sample of these 18 groups presents a unique opportunity to compare the dynamical mass estimates made applying different methods to the systems of galaxies , the principles of identification of which were essentially different .",
    "let us recall that the arrangement of galaxies in mk - groups was carried out via the pairwise revision of all galaxies with two conditions : the total energy of a virtual bound pair must be negative , and the pair components have to be within the `` zero velocity sphere , '' determined by the total mass of the pair . in the space of projected separations @xmath62 and radial velocity differences",
    "@xmath25 , these conditions are expressed as    @xmath63 @xmath64 where the condition    @xmath65    was assumed for the relation of the dynamical mass of each galaxy to its stellar mass .",
    "then , all the virtual bound pairs with common members were united in a group . unlike another widely used method of organizing the galaxies in `` friends of friends '' groups ( huchra & geller 1982 , crook et al .",
    "2007 ) , the ( 7 )  ( 9 ) criterion contains only one arbitrary dimensionless parameter @xmath66 . at the empirically selected value of @xmath67",
    ", the ( 7)(9 ) criterion brings together in pairs , groups and clusters about 54% of all galaxies , what is in good agreement with the observed structure of the local volume ( see the details in the mk11 ) .",
    "a comparison of parameters of the suites around 18 nearby massive galaxies with the characteristics of the corresponding nearby mk - groups is given in table 2 .",
    "the top rows of the table represent the data for the mk - groups , while the lower rows list the parameters of the suites .",
    "the columns contain : ( 1 ) name of the main galaxy of the group / suite ; ( 2 ) number of galaxies in the group / suite with measured radial velocities ; ( 3 ) the distance to the group ( mpc ) , determined by the mean radial velocity of the group members relative to the local group centroid at @xmath68 km / s / mpc , and the individual distance of the principal galaxy of the suite ; ( 4 ) dispersion of radial velocities in the group and the mean - square difference of the companion velocities relative to the main galaxy ( km / s ) ; ( 5 ) the mean harmonic radius of the group and the mean projection separation of companions from the main galaxy ( kpc ) ; ( 6 ) logarithm of the total stellar mass of the group or the suite ( in @xmath69 ) ; ( 7 ) logarithm of the projected mass of the group and the orbital mass of the suite ( in @xmath69 ) ; ( 8) the ratio of the projected ( or orbital ) mass - to - total stellar mass in the logarithmic scale ; ( 9 ) morphological type of the main galaxy on de vaucouleurs scale ; ( 10 ) difference between apparent k - magnitudes of the first and second members of the group ; ( 1113 ) the tidal indices , characterizing the environment density of the main galaxy in the group : here the @xmath42 index , determined by equation ( 6 ) , expresses the contribution of the most significant neighbor , the @xmath70 index accounts for the effect of five important neighbors , while the @xmath71 index corresponds to the logarithm of stellar density contrast in a sphere of 1 mpc radius around the main galaxy taken with respect to the mean cosmic density .",
    "the last line in the table shows the mean values of the considered quantities .",
    "note that the luminosity of the brightest suite member does not exceed 1/4 of the md s luminosity for 10 of the 15 suites , that justifys the consideration of suite galaxies as test particles orbiting around the central massive body .",
    "one can notice that table 2 has no data on the groups around ic  342 and ngc  6946 .",
    "they are not included in the list of mk - groups because located in the zone of strong galactic extinction .",
    "the groups of companions around the mw and m31 are also missed because their distances based on the mean radial velocities of the galaxies , used by makarov & karachentsev ( 2011 ) , would have no physical meaning .",
    "a comparison of the table 2 data on the groups versus the suites reveals the following properties .",
    "\\a ) the total number of galaxies in the mk - groups , 227 , is comparable to the total number of physical members of the suites : 170 at @xmath39 and 224 at @xmath72 . consequently , the association of galaxies into suites by the zones of gravitational influence around dominant galaxies , and by the mk - criterion ( 79 ) have approximately the same clustering efficiency rate . however , the data presented reveal also significant individual differences in the populations of groups and suites . for example , in the ngc  891 , ngc  4631 and ngc  4736 groups , this ratio amounts to 18:4 , 28:5 and 5:15 , respectively .",
    "the greatest differences are typical for the scattered groups ( suites ) , where the second member of the group by luminosity competes with the md .",
    "\\b ) the mean radial velocity dispersion in groups , equal to 83 km / s , and the mean square velocity difference of the companions in the suites , amounting to 99 km / s , are in a reasonable agreement with each other .",
    "in other words , condition ( 7 ) in the mk - criterion does not possess strong selectivity against the pairs of galaxies with a large radial velocity difference .",
    "\\c ) the difference between the hubble distance to the groups , @xmath73 , and individually measured distance to the main galaxy of the suite , @xmath74 , is on the average small : 7.44 mpc and 7.39 mpc , respectively . while in some groups , for instance , in ngc  628 and ngc  2903 , these distances differ by half ( due to the bulk motions towards the virgo cluster ) , which affects the luminosity of the group and influences the number of clustered members in it .",
    "\\d ) individual differences between the estimates of the projected mass and orbital mass are quite large .",
    "in the case of groups of galaxies around ngc  253 , ngc  891 , ngc  3627 , ngc  4594 , ngc  4736 and ngc  5194 , these differences exceed the factor 3",
    ". nevertheless , the average values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 for an ensemble of 18 groups / suites are in good agreement with each other .",
    "similarly , the average ratios of @xmath77 and @xmath78 do not show any significant systematic difference , although in some groups / suites these ratios differ significantly .",
    "in addition to random factors caused by the poor statistics , the differences in the estimates of @xmath79 and @xmath20 occur more in scattered groups , where we can discern the substructures around the galaxies , which are only slightly less massive than the main member of the group .",
    "the examples revealing the presence of such hierarchical substructures can be found in the ngc  891/ngc  925 , ngc  3368/ngc  3379 and ngc  5194/ngc  5055 groups .",
    "\\e ) the data of the last columns of table 2 show that the density of the group environment , the difference in the apparent magnitudes of two brightest members of the group , and the morphological type of the main galaxy do not affect the ratio of dark - to - luminous matter in the group in a substantial way .",
    "it should be emphasized that the derived above agreement between the typical values of orbital and projected masses in the local volume , @xmath80 , is not trivial one .",
    "the ungc catalog contains approximately the same number of radial velocities as what was used by mk11 within @xmath81 mpc .",
    "however , the ungc has much more data on galaxy distances than mk11 sample .",
    "actually , mk11 estimated distances to a group via the average redshift of its members burdened by peculiar velocities and local streams .",
    "this is does not matter in the case of ungc which collected hundreds accurate individual distances .",
    "another significant difference is caused by different algorithms applied to the galaxy grouping . to find a group , mk11 used as separations and luminosities of galaxies , as well their radial velocities . in the case of ungc , only 3d - separations and luminosities ( but not redshifts )",
    "were used to identify a suite of companions around a dominant galaxy .",
    "we can not state that one finding algorithm is better ( or objective ) than the other .",
    "but they both yield almost the same average ratio @xmath82 for the small local structures .",
    "the orbital mass estimates for the populated suites , shown in tables 1 and 2 , were determined by the suite members with tidal indices @xmath46 . obviously , the choice of the maximum value of @xmath42 , based on which the galaxies were included in the suite , affects the number of members of the suite , their total luminosity , and the orbital mass estimate . with large positive values of @xmath42 ,",
    "many physical companions of the md do not make it in its suite .",
    "the orbital mass would in this case prove to be underestimated .",
    "on the contrary , inclusion of galaxies with arbitrary negative values of @xmath42 in the suite contributes to its pollution with false members from the general field , and thus leads to an overestimation of the @xmath57 .",
    "figure 4 shows how sensitive are the @xmath54 estimates to the choice of the threshold value of @xmath42 for 15 most populous groups in the local volume .",
    "the variations of the @xmath54 ratio depending on @xmath42 in the range of @xmath83 $ ] with the increments of 0.1 are shown in this figure for each of the 15 suites .",

    "the ratio of the orbital mass - to - sum of stellar masses is weakly responsive to the variation of @xmath42 .",
    "this is true in particular for the companions of the suites around the mw and m31 , which are marked in the figure by solid diamonds and squares , respectively .",
    "the logarithm of the average value of @xmath85 for all the groups , shown by open diamonds , varies within the range of [ 1.59  1.67 ] when the threshold of @xmath42 changes from + 0.4 to 0.4 .    according to jones et al .",

    "this value is shown in fig .  4 by the dashed horizontal line . as one can see , all the groups ( suites ) , except for the ngc  3368 ( leo  i group ) and ngc  4594 ( `` sombrero '' ) have the @xmath54 ratios below this value .",
    "consequently , the amount of dark matter in the suite volumes around the massive nearby galaxies is clearly not enough to provide the cosmic density @xmath89 .",
    "the upper panel of fig .  5 shows the distribution of 18 most populated nearby groups given in table 2 by their total stellar masses and the projected mass estimates .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the cosmic value of @xmath3 = 97 .",
    "as it is seen , all the nearby groups locate below the @xmath89 line , following the value which is about 3 times lower ( dashed line ) .",
    "a similar diagram for the orbital mass estimates of the suites is shown at the bottom panel of figure 5 .",
    "each of the 15 populated suites ( table 1 ) is shown by a circle with a vertical bar , corresponding to the standard error of @xmath79 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are fixing the values of @xmath3 = 97 ( @xmath89 ) and 31 @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "the major part of the suites is concentrated near the line of @xmath92 , and only two suites : ngc  3368 and ngc  4594 reside above the @xmath89 line .",
    "in addition to 15 populated suites , three small diamonds in the figure show the average values of @xmath85 for the synthetic suites : l , m and s , the data on which are listed at the bottom of table  1 .",
    "synthetic suites around the galaxies of small ( s ) and medium ( m ) mass are characterized by a high @xmath85 ratio , and within the error they lie on the line of @xmath89 .    among the smallest suites ,",
    "isolated pairs of dwarf galaxies can be found , where each component of the pair is the main disturber for the second component .",
    "the list of such 12 dwarf pairs is presented in table 3 .",
    "the low luminosity of these galaxies clearly does not favour their detection outside the local volume . nevertheless , the catalog of binary galaxies in the local supercluster by karachentsev & makarov ( 2008 ) as well as the list of multiple dwarfs by ( makarov & uklein 2012 ) contain about 50 more similar dwarf pairs .",
    "the binary systems in table 3 are ranked by their distance from us .",
    "the table columns represent the following data , adopted from the ungc catalog : ( 1 ) names of the components ; ( 2 ) the distances ( mpc ) ; ( 3 ) tidal indices , characterizing the degree of mutual gravitational influence ; ( 4 ) logarithm of stellar mass ( @xmath69 ) ; ( 5 ) logarithm of the hydrogen mass ( @xmath69 ) ; ( 6 ) the radial velocity difference of the components ( km / s ) ; ( 7 ) the velocity measurement error ( km / s ) ; ( 8) projected separation ( kpc ) ; ( 9 ) logarithm of orbital mass ( @xmath69 ) . according to these data ,",
    "the average orbital mass of dwarf pairs amounts to @xmath93 , and the average sum of stellar masses of the components is @xmath94 .",
    "the ratio of these quantities @xmath95 is shown in the lower panel of fig . 5 by a square .",
    "the position of the square above the @xmath90 line ( but with a large error bar ) gives an impression that the dark - to - baryonic matter ratio tends to be higher in the low - luminosity galaxies than that in the galaxies with normal luminosity .",
    "this assertion has been repeatedly stated in the literature ( mateo 1998 , moster et al .",
    ".    however , we should pay attention to two important circumstances here .",
    "the orbital mass estimates using equation ( 4 ) are statistically biased ones . in the presence of radial velocity measurement errors , the product @xmath96 in ( 4 ) should be replaced by @xmath97 .",
    "accounting for the contribution of @xmath98 errors lowers the average ratio of @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "comparison of stellar vs. hydrogen masses of dwarf galaxies in pairs shows that these values are comparable with each other .",
    "the mean difference @xmath101 from the table 3 data is equal to 0.13 .",
    "it becomes positive , + 0.14 , if one takes into consideration that the mass of gas accounting for helium and molecular hydrogen is on the average 1.85 times larger than the mass of atomic hydrogen ( fukugita & peebles 2004 ) .",
    "having introduced both the corrections , the ratio of the orbital mass - to - sum of baryonic masses of the pairs drops to @xmath102 .",
    "summing the stellar masses in all the considered suites of the local volume , we obtain @xmath103 . with the average local stellar mass density of @xmath104mpc@xmath87 ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2013 ) and @xmath88 , the sphere of 10  mpc radius contains the total stellar mass of @xmath105 ( a small correction is introduced here , accounting for the zone of interstellar extinction in the milky way ) .",
    "therefore , the studied suites contain 80% of the total stellar mass in the local volume .",
    "the total orbital mass for them is @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath107 ratio is an important dynamic characteristic of the local volume .",
    "the 20% of stellar mass we have unaccounted for are distributed as the field galaxies .",
    "they contribute both in the denominator and the numerator of the @xmath108 ratio , and probably have little effect on its value .",
    "the position of the whole local volume in the @xmath109 diagram is shown by a large open diamond in the upper right corner of the bottom panel in figure 5 .",
    "the ratio of the sum of masses , equal to 53 is equivalent to the average density in the local volume , @xmath1(lv ) = 0.15 .",
    "note , however , that more than a half of the contribution to the total value of @xmath57 in the local volume is introduced only by two suites around ngc  4594 and ngc  3368 .",
    "both systems are on the far edge of the local volume at distances of 9.3 mpc and 10.4 mpc , respectively .",
    "individual distances to the majority of members of both suites are determined with an error of @xmath110 mpc by the tully - fisher method , or not measured at all , being instead attributed the distance of the main galaxy of the group . moreover ,",
    "the ngc  4594 and ngc  3368 groups are located in the immediate vicinity of the `` zero velocity sphere '' of the virgo cluster , where it is difficult to separate the bulk infall motions of galaxies toward the cluster from virial motions within the groups .",
    "we did not notice anything other special about their location with respect to the local sheet .",
    "obviously , these groups need a more comprehensive , special analysis of their structure and kinematics with the use of new observational data .",
    "it should be added that out of 6 members of the ngc  4594 suite , one galaxy , ddo  148 , resides at the large projected distance of 1.1 mpc from the sombrero galaxy , having the radial velocity difference of 276 km / s .",
    "the contribution of ddo  148 to the total orbital mass estimate of the sombrero suite is more than a half .",
    "since the distance to ddo  148 , @xmath111 = 9.0 mpc is determined by the tully - fisher method with the error of @xmath112 mpc , a more accurate estimate of its distance can dramatically change the value of @xmath57 for this suite .    if we limit the local volume by the 8 mpc radius , excluding a still uncertain situation on the far boundary , the ratio of the total orbital mass of all the suites in this volume to the sum of stellar masses will be @xmath113 at @xmath88 .",
    "on the lower panel of fig .",
    "5 , this value , falling on the @xmath92 line is marked by a large solid diamond .",
    "a high density of observational data on the radial velocities and distances of galaxies in the local volume gives an opportunity to determine the masses of nearby groups not only by the virial motions , but also by perturbations of the hubble flow around them .",
    "this idea was proposed by lynden - bell ( 1981 ) and sandage ( 1986 ) , and is based on the measurement of the radius of the zero velocity sphere @xmath2 which separates a group ( or a cluster ) from the surrounding volume that expands .    in the standard cosmological model with the parameters @xmath68 km / s / mpc and @xmath114 ( spergel et al . 2007 ) the total mass of a spherical overdensity",
    "is expressed as    @xmath115    an important circumstance here is that the estimate of the total mass of a group corresponds to the scale of @xmath2 , which is @xmath116 times larger than its virial radius .",
    "the analysis of observational data on radial velocities and separations of galaxies in the vicinity of the local group and other nearby groups was done by different authors . a summary for six groups",
    "is presented in table 4 .",
    "the columns of the table list : ( 1 ) name of the group ; ( 2 ) logarithm of the orbital mass of the group in the units of solar mass and its error ; ( 3 ) radius of the zero velocity sphere ( in mpc ) and its error ; ( 4 ) logarithm of the total mass of the group , determined by eq . ( 10 ) and its error ; ( 5 ) the difference of the total and orbital mass estimates ; ( 6 ) the reference to the source of data on @xmath2 .    in general , the estimates of mass by two independent methods agree with each other quite well . however , a moderate systematic difference of mass estimates in favour of the orbital masses is noteworthy . for six groups the mean",
    "difference amounts to @xmath117 .",
    "this paradoxical result lying in the fact that the estimates of the total mass of the groups on the scale of @xmath118 are lower than the orbital ( as well as the projected ) mass estimates on the scale of the virial radius @xmath12 can have a simple interpretation .",
    "chernin et al . (",
    "2013 ) noted that the estimate of the total mass of a group includes two components : @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the mass of dark and baryonic matter , and @xmath121 is the mass , negative in magnitude , determined by the dark energy with the density of @xmath122 : @xmath123    on the scale of @xmath12 the contribution of this component in the group mass is small , not exceeding 1% .",
    "but in the sphere of @xmath2 radius , the role of this `` mass defect '' becomes significant . in the standard @xmath5cdm model with @xmath124",
    "the contribution of dark energy is    @xmath125 i.e. about 40% of the value determined by eq .",
    "a correction to the total mass by a factor of 1.4 can almost completely eliminate the observed discrepancy between the group mass estimates at different scales .    in turn",
    ", such an agreement of mass estimates by the internal and external motions after the correction for the dark energy component can be interpreted as another empirical evidence for the existence of the dark energy itself appearing in the dynamics of nearby groups .",
    "the high - density data on the distances and radial velocities of @xmath126 most nearby galaxies from the ungc catalog provides an unique opportunity to investigate the distribution of light and dark matter in the local volume of @xmath127 mpc radius in outstanding detail .",
    "the analysis of these data shows that about a half of the population of the local volume is concentrated in the rooms , dominated by the gravitational influence of only 15 most massive galaxies .",
    "ranking the galaxies by the magnitude of tidal force allows to group small galaxies in suites around their main disturbers . assuming the keplerian motions of the companions around the central galaxy with a typical orbit eccentricity of @xmath128 , we have determined the orbital masses of the main galaxies in the local volume , as well as the total mass of less populated suites .",
    "wherein , we did not use any restrictions on the radial velocity of companions relative to their main galaxy in the suites .    for the mass of dark halo around the mw and around m31 ,",
    "we have obtained the values of ( 1.35@xmath1290.47 ) and ( 1.76@xmath1290.33 ) in the units of @xmath130 , respectively . analyzing the mass estimates of these galaxies , made by various authors and via different methods , shull ( 2014 )",
    "has concluded that the virial masses of mw and m31 amount to ( @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) , what is in a remarkable agreement with our estimates .",
    "the total mass of the local group from our data is @xmath133 ) .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the ( mw + m31 ) mass estimate by partridge et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2013 ) obtained based on the timing argument .    within the local volume",
    ", there are 18 groups identified with the suites , for which mk11 estimated the virial ( projected ) masses @xmath20 . on average , the agreement between the orbital and projected mass estimates for the suites and groups proves to be quite satisfactory .",
    "the typical ratio of both the orbital or the projected mass - to - sum of stellar masses of galaxies forming the group amounts to @xmath134 .    among the smallest suites in the local volume",
    "there are 12 isolated dwarf pairs , where each galaxy with a characteristic stellar mass of @xmath135 is the md for the second component .",
    "the average ratio of the orbital mass- to - sum of stellar masses for them , @xmath136 , looks a little more than that for the suites around luminous galaxies . however , taking account of a significant gas component in these small binary systems leads to the baryonic ratio of @xmath137 , close to the typical one of the galaxies with normal luminosities .",
    "the distortion in the hubble flow , observed around six most nearby groups allows us to determine their total masses .",
    "independent estimates of total masses via the radius of zero velocity sphere @xmath2 are slightly lower than the orbital and virial values .",
    "this difference may be due to the local effect of dark energy , which affects the kinematics of the galaxy groups , especially scattered ones .",
    "the data we have obtained on the orbital masses of suites / groups , summed over the local volume of the 8 mpc radius , yield the ratio of dark - to - luminous matter of @xmath138 , which corresponds to the mean local density of @xmath139 .",
    "it seems difficult to indicate the precise error of this value , because the error is rather dominated by systematic effects than by random statistics .",
    "the present result is in line with the measurement @xmath140 , derived by mk11 within a volume of the local supercluster ( @xmath141 mpc ) using an independent approach to find galaxy groups .",
    "therefore , a threefold divergence between the local and global values of @xmath1 , noted by many authors , remains to be an unsolved mystery of the near - field cosmology .",

    "<S> we use observational properties of galaxies accumulated in the updated nearby galaxy catalog to derive a dark matter mass of luminous galaxies via motions of their companions . </S>",
    "<S> the data on orbital - to - stellar mass ratio are presented for 15 luminous galaxies situated within 11 mpc from us : the milky way , m31 , m81 , ngc5128 , ic342 , ngc253 , ngc4736 , ngc5236 , ngc6946 , m101 , ngc4258 , ngc4594 , ngc3115 , ngc3627 and ngc3368 , as well as for a composit suite around other nearby galaxies of moderate and low luminosity . the typical ratio for them is @xmath0 = 31 , corresponding to the mean local density of matter @xmath1 = 0.09 , i.e 1/3 of the global cosmic density . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity seems to be rather an upper limit of dark matter density , since the peripheric population of the suites may suffer from the presence of fictitious unbound members . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the milky way and m31 haloes have lower dimensions and lower stellar masses than those of other 13 nearby luminous galaxies . however , the dark - to - stellar mass ratio for both the milky way and m31 is the typical one for other neighboring luminous galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the distortion in the hubble flow , observed around the local group and five other neighboring groups yields their total masses within the radius of zero velocity surface,@xmath2 , which are slightly lower than the orbital and virial values . </S>",
    "<S> this difference may be due to the effect of dark energy , producing a kind of `` mass defect '' within @xmath2 .    </S>",
