    "constraints on populations of low - mass black holes ( bhs ) are important for understanding formation channels for seed bhs in the early universe and the demographics of relic seed bhs in the local universe ( reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such seeds are referred to as intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) because they occupy the gap in mass between the well - studied stellar - mass bhs with @xmath5 and the well - established supermassive bhs with @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , if the scaling relations between central bhs and their host stellar systems differ between the intermediate - mass and supermassive ends , then this could provide clues about the co - evolution , or not , of these entities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    of particular interest here",
    "are the theoretical predictions that dense star clusters could host imbhs formed either slowly through the successive mergers of stellar - mass bhs @xcite or rapidly through the runaway collisions of massive stars in the cluster centers @xcite .",
    "in addition , if imbhs exist in star clusters , the inspiral of stellar - mass bhs into imbhs is expected to be a key source of gravitational waves for planned space missions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "overall , finding imbhs in star clusters could validate a theoretical formation channel , bolster gravitational - wave predictions , and test scaling relations between stellar systems and the central bhs they host .    at distances of about 10 mpc",
    ", future near - infrared telescopes will be able to measure bh masses as low as @xmath7 by resolving their spheres of influence in their host stellar systems @xcite . while this is expected to lead to a robust inventory of imbhs in the local universe , these next - generation facilities are still many years off .",
    "moreover , such sphere - of - influence studies have already been applied to star clusters in the local group , and all these studies are controversial ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    due to these on - going controversies and",
    "not wanting to wait for future facilities , we are pursuing an independent route , namely searching for radio signatures of accretion onto putative imbhs in extragalactic star clusters @xcite .",
    "analogies with stellar - mass bhs suggest that an imbh will spend more time in the hard x - ray state associated with a low accretion rate , than in the soft x - ray state associated with a high accretion rate ( reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if only a few radio observations are available , they are more likely to sample the steady radio emission associated with the hard x - ray state , as compared to the flaring radio emssion associated with a transition from the hard x - ray state to the soft x - ray state .",
    "we thus take three approaches , as follows :    1 .   radio emission resembling that from hlx-1 in its hard x - ray state @xcite could be directly detected from an individual cluster .",
    "2 .   using the empirical fundamental - plane regression for the hard x - ray state , constraints on x - ray and radio luminosities can yield an estimate of the mass of an imbh @xcite .",
    "3 .   a conservative",
    ", semi - empirical model can be used to predict the mass of an imbh that , if undergoing bondi accretion in the hard x - ray state , is consistent with the radio luminosity @xcite .    in this paper , we use the karl g.  jansky very large array ( vla ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to search for radio emission from hundreds of candidate star clusters localized by @xcite in a mosaic of with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "we focus on ngc1023 because it is one of only a few early - type galaxies with such an extensive acs mosaic @xcite and , at a distance of 11.1 mpc , is amongst the nearest galaxies in the extensive vla survey of k.  nyland et al .",
    "( 2015 , in preparation ) . at this distance 1 = 53.8 pc .    after folding in prior information @xcite , @xcite divide their candidate star clusters by age : stars older than 5 gyr dominate the light of 92% of the clusters , whereas stars with ages of a few hundred myr dominate the light of the remaining 8% .",
    "those latter intermediate - age clusters may have formed during a recent gas - rich interaction between ngc1023 and its companion ngc1023a , with a projected offset of @xmath8 ( 8 kpc ) .",
    "still , the vast majority of the clusters are dominated by an old , globular - cluster - like stellar population . using that population s z - band ( f850lp ) mass - to - light ratio from @xcite and magnitudes from @xcite , the stellar masses of the clusters range from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "it is also important to underscore that only a handful of the candidate clusters have had their association with ngc1023 or its companion confirmed spectroscopically .",
    "@xcite used chandra data to localize several dozen x - ray sources but did not attempt to match those sources with candidate star clusters .",
    "the new vla results are described in   [ imaging ] .",
    "no individual cluster is detected , and   [ implications ] explores the implications of these nondetections regarding hlx-1 analogs , x - ray detected clusters and semi - empirical model predictions .",
    "  [ sumcon ] contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "the a configuration of the vla was used to observe ngc1023 on 2012 october 3 ut as part of an extensive survey for low - luminosity active galactic nuclei in early - type galaxies ( proposal code 12b-281 , pi k.  nyland ) .",
    "full details will appear in k.  nyland et al .",
    "( 2015 , in preparation ) but key aspects are given here .",
    "the observations were made assuming a coordinate equinox of 2000 and were phase referenced to the calibrator j0230 + 4032 at an assumed position of @xmath11 and @xmath12 with one - dimensional errors at 1@xmath2 of 2 mas .",
    "the switching angle between ngc1023 and j0230 + 4032 was @xmath13 .",
    "one observation of ngc1023 was immediately preceeded and followed by observations of j0130 + 0432 , leading to a net exposure time on ngc1023 of 264 s. every 1 s the correlator generated 1024 contiguous 2 mhz channels , resulting in a total bandwidth of 2.048 ghz per circular polarization centered at a frequency of 5.5 ghz .",
    "observations of 3c48 were also acquired to set the amplitude scale to an estimated accuracy of about 3% .",
    "all but one of the 27 antennas provided data of acceptable quality . given the observing strategies , the one - dimensional astrometric error at 1@xmath2 is estimated to be @xmath14 .",
    "release 4.1.0 of the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) package @xcite was used to calibrate and edit the visibility data in version 1.2.0 of an automated pipeline .",
    "the casa task clean was used to form and deconvolve an image of the stokes @xmath15 emission from ngc1023 that spanned @xmath16 , well matched to the hst mosaic @xcite .",
    "the casa task clean was run with ( 1 ) a robustness parameter of 0.5 to obtain the best compromise among sensitivity , spatial resolution and sidelobe suppression ; ( 2 ) an nterms parameter of 2 to account for the large fractional bandwidth ; and ( 3 ) the gridmode parameter set to `` widefield '' and the wprojplanes parameter set to 128 to correct for the effects of non - coplanar baselines .",
    "the casa task widebandpbcor was then run to correct the vla image for primary beam attenuation , characterized by a half - power diameter of @xmath17 where the attenuation is 50% and thus the correction is 200% . for comparison , at that location the response to a point source",
    "is estimated to be reduced by about 2% due to bandwidth smearing across 2 mhz channels and by less than 1% due to time averaging over 1 s integrations , and no corrections were made for these negligible effects .",
    "a square image spanning the half - power diameter of the primary beam on each axis was used for subsequent analysis .",
    "this vla image at 5.5 ghz captured 339 star cluster candidates identified and cataloged by @xcite .",
    "for each of those clusters , the 2015 december 31 release of nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was used to form a cutout , with task subim , spanning @xmath18 and centered on the optical position @xcite .",
    "the acs images were astrometrized by matching the extracted sources with cfht archival catalogs with one - dimensional errors at 1@xmath2 estimated to be 015 ( v.  pota , 2014 , priv .",
    "comm . ) . the cutout for cluster i d 39 in the nomenclature of @xcite",
    "was dropped from further analysis because it was contaminated by a 5.5-ghz counterpart to a background qso @xcite .",
    "the radio and optical positions of this background qso differed by @xmath19 , consistent with the error estimates quoted above for the radio and optical systems",
    ". i d 58 was located too close to the edge of the vla image to form a cutout and was also dropped from further analysis . after this culling , 337 cutouts remain for an analysis of individual clusters ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the 1@xmath2 rms noise level amongst the cutouts has a range of 16 - 68  @xmath20jy  beam@xmath21 , reflecting the primary beam attenuation . to minimize the risk of a false - positive detection of one or more individual clusters when examining an ensemble of 337",
    ", we adopt an individual one - tail detection threshold of 3.5@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "none of the 337 candidate clusters in ngc1023 is detected above its local 3.5@xmath2 level at 5.5 ghz ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the corresponding 3.5@xmath2 radio luminosities are @xmath22 erg s@xmath21 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "such a luminosity definition implicitly assumes a flat radio continuum spectrum up to 5.5 ghz .    for the 311 old clusters , all accreting stellar - mass compact objects , whether in the hard x - ray state @xcite or associated with a transition from the hard x - ray state to the soft x - ray state @xcite , would have radio luminosities too faint to be detected . for the 26 intermediate - age clusters , no other data are available for comparison .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the massive star clusters in iizw40 at a distance of 10.5 mpc have shed their enshrouding nebular emission by an age of 10 myr .",
    "specifically , the 10-myr old cluster ssc - south in iizw40 is not detected at 4.9 ghz and has a radio - luminosity upper limit of @xmath23 erg @xmath24 .",
    "this strongly suggests that ngc1023 s ten - times - older clusters should lack contamination from free - free nebular emission . thus , overall , we expect no contaminants for the star clusters in figure 1 , allowing us to explore the implications of the nondetections within the contexts of analogs of hlx-1 (   [ hlx ] ) , x - ray detected clusters (   [ x - ray ] ) , and predictions of a semi - empirical model (   [ model ] ) .",
    "hlx-1 is a strong imbh candidate with @xmath25 that is hosted by a cluster with a stellar mass of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass of the host cluster resembles those of the clusters in ngc1023 , but the age of the host cluster s light - dominating stars , about 20 myr , is significantly younger .    when transitioning from its hard to soft x - ray states , hlx-1 can achieve a luminosity at 7 ghz of @xmath27 erg s@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "such a level is incompatible with the 5.5-ghz upper limits for individual star clusters in ngc1023 ( figure 2 ) .    in its hard x - ray state , a combination of four measurements of hlx-1 yields a luminosity at 6.8 ghz of @xmath28 erg s@xmath21 , with no significant evidence for variability over several days or months @xcite .",
    "this steady luminosity is also incompatible with the upper limits for individual star clusters in ngc1023 .",
    "as @xcite argue , this steady emission from hlx-1 is likely doppler boosted by a factor of about five to ten , implying a side - on luminosity of about @xmath29 erg s@xmath21 .",
    "if such a side - on luminosity was present in any of the 337 individual clusters in ngc1023 , figure 2 shows that it could escape detection in only a single cluster .",
    "it is important to highlight the advantages of radio searches for steady emission from hlx-1 analogs : its hyperluminous x - ray luminosity of @xmath30 erg s@xmath21 is achieved only during a 2 - 3 week soft state that occurs approximately yearly @xcite and can thus be missed if only a few x - ray observations are made .",
    "in contrast , steady radio emission should be present during most of the year between soft x - ray states , making it easier to detect even in a single radio observation , the situation for ngc1023 .",
    "also , at the distance of ngc1023 , the hyperluminous x - ray luminosity of hlx-1 is below the sensitivity threshold of current and past x - ray all - sky monitors , blocking those discovery routes .",
    "even more stringent constraints on hlx-1 analogs in ngc1023 come from the weighted - mean image stacks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in figure 3 for the 311 old clusters and in figure 4 for the 26 intermediate - age clusters .",
    "the stacks , which measure the mean contribution to the total radio emission from each cluster population , were made using the aips task comb .",
    "the stacks 3@xmath2 upper limits correspond to radio luminosities of @xmath31 erg s@xmath21 and @xmath32 erg s@xmath21 .",
    "these stacks rule out emission from a population of hlx-1 analogs amongst either cluster population .",
    "the light - dominating stars in the clusters in ngc1023 are at least a factor of ten older than the 20-myr - old stars in the cluster hosting hlx-1 @xcite .",
    "so one could speculate that if imbhs exist in ngc1023 clusters , those older clusters have lost their imbhs due to graviational wave recoil .",
    "however , for an imbh as massive as hlx-1 , @xmath33 , ejection from the cluster is very improbable @xcite .",
    "instead , the absence of hlx-1 analogs in ngc1023 suggests that hlx-1 is accreting gas somehow related to the young stars in its host cluster .",
    "an enhanced gas supply could arise from material remaining after the burst of star formation 20 myr ago , or from material donated by a young stellar companion , as advocated by @xcite .",
    "star ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . ]",
    "either way , such an enhanced fuel supply would not be available to the imbhs , if any exist , in the star clusters in ngc1023 .",
    "alternatively , it might be that the hlx-1 phenomenon is so rare that a radio analog is simply not expected in ngc1023 .",
    "cluster ids 153 , 176 and 305 in the nomenclature of @xcite have x - ray detections , all of hard - state emission @xcite . using the empirical fundamental - plane regression for the contracted sample of @xcite ,",
    "the clusters x - ray luminosities from @xcite and radio - luminosity upper limits from figure 2 imply individual 3@xmath2 imbh masses of @xmath34 .",
    "these clusters have old stellar populations and estimated stellar masses of @xmath35 or less . but a star cluster is unlikely to host an imbh whose mass is comparable to , or exceeds , its stellar mass @xcite , so these imbh mass constraints are not physically interesting . future imaging that reaches clusters with lower x - ray luminosities",
    "would be especially beneficial .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we use a semi - empirical model to predict the mass of a putative imbh that , if undergoing hard - x - ray - state accretion in a gas - poor cluster , is consistent with the upper limit on the radio luminosity .",
    "specifically , we conservatively assume that the imbh undergoes accretion at a fraction @xmath36 of the bondi rate from a tenuous , globular - cluster - like medium with a gas density @xmath37 @xmath38 .",
    "the rationale for these assumptions and their uncertainties are discussed in section 3.4 of @xcite .",
    "these parameters yield a prediction for the hard - state x - ray luminosity @xmath39 .",
    "the empirical fundamental - plane regression for the contracted sample of @xcite is then used to predict the associated radio luminosity @xmath40 .",
    "( using an earlier regression , @xcite demonstrate that @xmath41 . ) a detection or upper limit to a radio luminosity thus maps to a detection or upper limit to an imbh mass .",
    "the results of applying this semi - emipirical model to ngc1023 are shown in figure 5 .",
    "to avoid clutter only the best 3.5@xmath2 constraint from figure 2 for individual clusters in ngc1023 is shown .",
    "figure 5 also conveys the 3@xmath2 constraints from the stacks of the old ( figure 3 ) and the intermediate - age ( figure 4 ) clusters in ngc1023 . for comparison purposes ,",

    "the best radio luminosity constraint for individual cluster candidates in ngc1023 implies an imbh mass of @xmath43 .",
    "the constraints from the stacks of the old and the intermediate - age clusters in ngc1023 correspond to mean imbh masses of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "however , recalling that the clusters stellar masses are @xmath46 , imbh constraints are only physically interesting amongst the most massive clusters with , say , about twice as much mass in stars as in a putative imbh .    applying a z - band cut of 20.5",
    "selects the most massive clusters , all old and with stellar masses @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "figure 5 then yields an inferred mean imbh mass of @xmath48 for the population of massive clusters .",
    "this is a physically interesting constraint as it suggests black - hole mass fractions of @xmath49 for the massive star clusters .",
    "cast somewhat differently , the clusters mean stellar mass is @xmath50 , implying a mean black - hole mass fraction of less than 0.16 .",
    "still , it should be kept in mind that the interpretation of @xmath51 is affected by unknowns like the distribution function of imbh masses and the fraction of clusters occupied by an imbh .",
    "three massive clusters have been spectroscopically confirmed as being associated with ngc1023 @xcite and merit special note .",
    "i d 33 and i d 269 are each as luminous as g1 . assuming a uniform imbh mass distribution and a high imbh occupation fraction , i d 33 and 269 each have @xmath52 ; for comparison , the individual values inferred for g1 are @xmath53 from a sphere - of - influence approach @xcite , @xmath54 from a fundamental - plane approach @xcite and @xmath55 from figure 5 . under the same assumptions ,",
    "i d 102 , an ultra - compact dwarf , has @xmath56 ; for comparison , @xcite reported an individual value of 0.15 for the ultra - compact dwarf m60-ucd1 from a sphere - of - influence approach .",
    "these comparisons suggest that pushing @xmath51 lower by factors of a few could reveal analogs of g1 and m60-ucd1 in ngc1023 .",
    "deeper vla imaging of these massive clusters in ngc1023 is feasible but , already , this stacking analysis is sensitive to the mass regime targeted for dynamical studies of extragalactic star clusters with next - generation near - infrared telescopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , these and additional massive clusters could be surveyed to a uniform depth in a future vla mosaic that covers the full diameter , @xmath57 ( 41 kpc ) , of ngc1023 s system of about 500 star clusters @xcite .",
    "in addition , the methodology demonstrated in this work on ngc1023 could be applied to other nearby early - type galaxies with rich systems of star clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . finally , although the conservative , semi - empirical model of @xcite is appealing because of its simplicity ,",
    "as the photometric data improve one could consider applying more complex models with additional free parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
