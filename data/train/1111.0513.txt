    "the baryon - baryon interaction in the strangeness @xmath0 sector and , specifically , the @xmath3 system has been a topic of interest for quite some time . the fascination was generated not least by the possible existence of the so - called @xmath10-dibaryon , a deeply bound 6-quark state with @xmath11 , isospin @xmath12 , and @xmath0 , predicted by r.  jaffe in 1977 based on a bag - model calculation @xcite .",
    "the binding energies of @xmath3 in nuclei , deduced from sparse information on doubly strange hypernuclei @xcite indicated a strongly attractive @xmath13 @xmath3 interaction and seemed to be at least not inconsistent with the existence of such a bound state .",
    "the perspective changed drastically when in 2001 a new ( and unambiguous ) candidate for @xmath14 with a much lower binding energy was identified @xcite , the so - called nagara event , suggesting that the @xmath3 interaction should be only moderately attractive .",
    "this conjecture concurs also with evidence provided by various searches for the @xmath10 dibaryon that did not yield any support for its existence , cf .",
    "@xcite for the latest experiments .",
    "however , very recently the @xmath10-dibaryon was put back on the agenda .",
    "lattice qcd calculations by the nplqcd @xcite as well as by the hal qcd @xcite collaborations provided evidence for a bound @xmath10-dibaryon . while the actual computations were performed for pion masses still significantly larger than the physical one , extrapolations suggest that the @xmath10-dibaryon could be still bound by around 0  7 mev @xcite at the physical point , but it could also move above the @xmath3 threshold and dissolve into the continuum @xcite .",
    "( the original @xmath10-dibaryon @xcite was expected to be bound by roughly 80 mev ! )    indeed , the strength of the @xmath3 interaction as well as those of other @xmath0 baryon - baryon systems is of rather general interest , noteably for a better understanding of the role played by the su(3 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "theoretical investigations of the @xmath0 sector that have been performed within the conventional meson - exchange picture @xcite , utilizing the constituent quark model @xcite , and also in the framework of chiral effective field theory ( @xmath15eft ) @xcite all rely strongly on the su(3 ) symmetry as guideline . furthermore , the hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath16 ) interaction plays an important role in the understanding of the global properties of compact stars like neutron stars . their stability and size as well as",
    "the cooling process depend sensitively on the strength of the @xmath16 interaction @xcite .",
    "as indicated above , practically the only experimental constraint we have so far on the @xmath3 interaction comes from the analyis of double-@xmath17 hypernuclei . in the present paper",
    "we want to call attention to the fact that there is also another and even more direct way to determine the strength of the @xmath3 force but also the one in other @xmath0 systems .",
    "it consists in studying the final - state interaction ( fsi ) of reactions where corresponding pairs of hyperons are produced .",
    "in fact , recently we proposed a method for extracting hadronic scattering lengths from production reactions @xcite .",
    "the presentation of the method in those publications was done with special emphasis on its application to the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath18 ) interaction . in particular ,",
    "the reactions @xmath19 and @xmath20 were analyzed , and possible uncertainties of the method were established .",
    "polarization observables needed to disentangle different spin states of the final @xmath18 system were identified .    in the present paper",
    "we explore the possibility of applying the method proposed in @xcite to the @xmath3 system , but also other baryon - baryon states with @xmath0 or even @xmath1 are considered .",
    "our study is motivated by the available data on the @xmath3 invariant mass distribution determined in the reaction @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these data are afflicted by sizeable uncertainties , but still they allow us to demonstrate the practicability of our method and to extract an actual value for the @xmath3 @xmath13 scattering length . in order to stimulate future dedicated experiments we consider specifically reactions like @xmath21 or @xmath22 where corresponding high - statistics measurements could be performed at j - parc .",
    "the clas collaboration at jlab has measured @xmath23 @xcite and , thus , it might be feasible that they can perform also experiments for @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "yet another option are reactions like @xmath26 and @xmath27 which could be measured at the future fair facility , for example . since the spin structure of these reactions differs partly from the ones considered in @xcite",
    "the question of what polarization observables are needed to disentangle the singlet- and triplet baryon - baryon states has to be re - addressed .",
    "note , however , that for the considered @xmath3 system this issue is not relevant .",
    "near threshold it can only be in the spin - singlet ( @xmath8 ) state .",
    "due to the pauli principle the other @xmath28-wave , the @xmath29 , is forbidden in this case .",
    "thus , no polarization experiment is required and , consequently , our method could be even applied to data on @xmath3 production on somewhat heavier nuclei , e.g. in @xmath30 or @xmath31 .    independently of that , the error estimation @xcite for the method has to be re - done .",
    "specifically , for the @xmath3 system the inelastic threshold ( due to the @xmath4 channel ) lies with around 25 mev much lower than for @xmath32 ( where it is around 80 mev and due to the @xmath33 channel ) .",
    "however , as we will see , the latter aspect increases the theoretical error of our method only marginally , under the discussed reasonable assumptions , and in the absence of a bound state .",
    "taking into account the possibility of a bound state requires much more effort and is technically more complicated . in view of the current extrapolations of the lattice",
    "qcd results which rather seem to disfavor the existence of a bound state @xcite we avoid the pertinent complications in the present study .    for completeness let us mention that fsi effects as a tool to constrain the @xmath3 interaction were considered already many years ago by afnan and collaborators @xcite .",
    "their study was done under rather different presuppositions , namely for the reaction @xmath34 and within the framework of faddeev equations . with regard to the @xmath4 system",
    "there is also an entirely different possibility to determine the corresponding scattering lengths , namely via the study of @xmath35 atoms",
    ". shifts of the energy levels due to the presence of the strong interaction would permit to deduce the scattering lengths for @xmath36 or @xmath37 , say , via the deser - trueman formula .",
    "the prospects of corresponding experiments were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we review briefly our method .",
    "section iii is devoted to the @xmath3 system .",
    "first we provide a new estimation for the error of the scattering length due to the extraction method , taking into account the relatively small separation of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 thresholds .",
    "then we apply our method to available data on the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum from a measurement of the reaction @xmath7 . in sect .",
    "iv we discuss several aspects of applying our method also to the @xmath4 and @xmath38 final - state interactions and even to the strangeness @xmath1 sector .",
    "the paper ends with a short summary .",
    "details of the polarization observables required for separating the spin singlet and triplet states are summarized in an appendix .",
    "the basic idea of the method is to exploit the scale separation between a short - ranged production operator and a long - ranged final - state interaction ( fsi ) . in this case",
    "the production operator can be regarded as point - like , and the fsi can be factored out .",
    "these conditions restrict the class of reactions and kinematic regimes that one can consider .",
    "namely , one can only apply the method to reactions with large momentum transfer @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , the scattering length @xmath40 in the system under consideration must have an appropriate magnitude , i.e. fulfil the condition @xmath41 .",
    "sufficiently large scattering lengths are expected in the baryon - baryon sector .",
    "in particular , it is interesting to study the hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions with different strangeness content of the hyperons . an elegant way to utilize",
    "the condition of scale separation is a dispersion - relation approach . imposing unitarity and analyticity constraints on the amplitude and assuming that there are no bound states , one arrives at the following expression for the reaction amplitude @xmath42 @xcite @xmath43\\phi(s , t , m^2 ) , \\label{om}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the invariant mass of the produced baryon - baryon system with the threshold value @xmath45",
    ", @xmath46 is the total center - of - mass ( cm ) energy squared , and @xmath47 represents all the remaining kinematic variables the amplitude depends upon .",
    "the function @xmath48 slowly varies with @xmath49 , which is a consequence of the assumed large momentum transfer .",
    "the cut off @xmath50 has to be determined in such a way that the integral extends over the whole region where fsi effects are expected to be important . based on scale arguments a condition for @xmath50 was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite which reads , re - formulated in terms of the maximum kinetic energy in the two - baryon system , @xmath51 . here",
    "@xmath52 is the scattering length in question and @xmath53 is the reduced mass of the baryon - baryon system . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the hyperon - nucleon interaction a typical cut off is given by the condition @xmath54 mev .",
    "the baryon - baryon scattering process has to be elastic in this region ( i.e. there should be no other open channels ) and it should be dominated by the @xmath46-wave amplitude parametrized by the phase shift @xmath55 . note that formula ( [ om ] ) can only be applied to amplitudes for a specific baryon - baryon spin state @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , one has to be able to separate spin - singlet and spin - triplet states experimentally .",
    "the index `` s '' on the quantities above ( and below ) is a reminder that one has to consider the production of the baryon - baryon system in a definite spin @xmath28 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite how one can invert eq .",
    "( [ om ] ) to express the scattering length via the reaction amplitude squared ( or the differential cross section @xmath56 ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the masses of the two baryons , @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the cm momentum in the baryon - baryon system and * p * indicates that the principal value of the intregral has to be taken . an analogous equation can be derived for the effective range .",
    "possible theoretical uncertainties of the method originate from the following sources : ( i ) energy dependence of the production operator , ( ii ) influence of scattering at higher energies ( @xmath62 ) , ( iii ) contributions from inelastic channels ( e.g. from the @xmath63 transition ) and ( iv ) final state interaction among other pairs of particles . for the hyperon - nucleon fsi the theoretical uncertainty in the determination of the scattering length",
    "was estimated to be @xmath64 fm at most @xcite .",
    "this estimate was confirmed by model calculations of production amplitudes using several different models for the hyperon - nucleon interactions with triplet and singlet scattering lengths varying from @xmath65 to @xmath66 fm .    the general form of eq .",
    "( [ om ] ) admits approximations under certain conditions .",
    "one of the standard approximative treatments follows from the assumption that the phase shifts are given by the first two terms in the effective range expansion , @xmath67 over the whole energy range , which is usually called the effective range approximation ( era ) . in this case",
    "the relevant integrals ( [ om ] ) can be evaluated in closed form as @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "because of its simplicity eq .",
    "( [ arform ] ) is often used for the treatment of the fsi .",
    "a further simplification can be made if one assumes that @xmath70 , a situation that is realized in the @xmath8 partial wave of the @xmath71 system .",
    "then the energy dependence of the quantity in eq .",
    "( [ arform ] ) is given by the energy dependence of the elastic amplitude @xmath72 as long as @xmath73 .",
    "therefore one expects that , at least for small kinetic energies , @xmath71 elastic scattering and particle production reactions with a @xmath71 final state exhibit the same energy dependence @xcite , which indeed was experimentally confirmed for meson production @xcite .",
    "the treatment of fsi effects based on eq .",
    "( [ mw ] ) is often referred to as migdal - watson approach @xcite , the one utilizing eq .",
    "( [ arform ] ) as jost - function approach .",
    "the reliability of such approximations as compared to the formula  ( [ a ] ) was investigated in detail in @xcite . in general the method based on eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) works systematically better than the approximations and gives scattering lengths within @xmath64 fm accuracy even for rather large scattering lengths like those for @xmath71 scattering .",
    "the uncertainty in the extraction employing the other two methods is typically larger .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite these procedure lead to a systematic deviation from the true values of the scattering lengths of the order of 0.3 fm ( jost ) and of 0.7 fm ( migdal - watson ) .",
    "the @xmath3 system is certainly the most promising case where one could apply our method .",
    "its threshold is the lowest one among all @xmath0 channels and measurements could be performed for the reaction @xmath74 , for example .",
    "moreover , no polarization experiment is required because ( near threshold ) the @xmath3 can be only in the ( spin singlet ) @xmath8 partial wave .",
    "the @xmath29 state is forbidden due to the pauli principle , as already mentioned .",
    "thus , spin triplet states can only occur in @xmath75 ( or higher partial ) waves - and it is save to assume that such higher partial waves do not contribute near threshold .",
    "there is , however , a complication because the first inelastic threshold ( due to @xmath4 ) is fairly close : the @xmath76 channel opens at an excess energy of 23.06 mev , c.f .",
    "( in the @xmath77 case considered in @xcite the first inelastic channel ( @xmath78 ) opens at 76.96 mev ! ) thus , it is necessary to re - do the error estimate of ref . @xcite .",
    "this will be done in subsection a below .",
    "note that , for convenience , we will work with isospin - averaged masses throughout this section so that the @xmath4 threshold is located at 25.8 mev !    in subsection",
    "b we apply our method to the @xmath3 invariant mass distribution measured in the reaction @xmath7 by the kek - ps e224 collaboration @xcite . those data , though afflicted by sizeable error bars , allow us to demonstrate how our method works , and they even enable us to deduce a concrete value for the @xmath3 @xmath8 scattering length .      in this subsection",
    ", we generalize the discussion of theoretical errors presented in @xcite to the case of the occurrence of inelastic channels . specifically , we estimate the theoretical error for the extraction of the hyperon - hyperon scattering length exemplary for the reaction @xmath74 taking into account that there is a near - by inelastic threshold due to the coupling of @xmath79 to the @xmath4 channel .",
    "the uncertainties originate @xcite from the energy ( i.e. @xmath49 ) dependence of the function @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ om ] ) .",
    "these include the energy dependence of the production operator ( i.e. the influence of left - hand singularities ) , contributions of the elastic scattering to the dispersion integral at higher energies , the influence of inelastic channels , and the interaction between other pairs of particles in the final state .",
    "the latter effect can be controlled by choosing different kinematical conditions such as initial energy ( final - state interaction among other pairs of particles would depend on such a choice whereas the @xmath3 fsi does not ) . also investigating the invariant - mass distribution for a corresponding pair of particles via",
    "a dalitz plot analysis can provide additional information on their interaction @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we will disregard this ( possibly important ) kind of correction and focus on the other three .",
    "the energy dependence of the production amplitude @xmath80 can be deduced from the basic principles of analyticity and unitarity .",
    "the discontinuity of the amplitude in @xmath49 is given by the sum of the elastic term , the inelastic contribution of the @xmath4 ( and/or other ) channel , @xmath81 , and the left - hand part , @xmath82 , denoting the remaining contribution from the production operator @xmath83 the inelastic contribution reads @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the inelasticity parameter in the @xmath3 system , @xmath86 is the production amplitude for the reaction @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the @xmath89 transition amplitude .",
    "the latter can be written in terms of @xmath85 , @xmath90 , and the phase shift @xmath91 of the @xmath4 channel : @xmath92 in order to shorten the notation we rewrite @xmath93 as @xmath94 where we suppressed any dependence on @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and where we denoted the phases of the production amplitudes @xmath95 and @xmath86 by @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ d_s ] ) in the physical region can be represented as ( see refs .",
    "@xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the upper end of the left - hand cut .",
    "in order to remove the energy independent part from the inelastic dispersion integral , we made subtractions at @xmath100 in the definition of @xmath101 and in the inelastic dispersion integral ( a constant term is assigned then to the left - hand contribution which anyway , as we will show , is slowly varying with energy . )    the theoretical error of the extracted scattering length is determined by the energy dependence of the function @xmath48 from eq .",

    ", width=226,height=113 ]    let us first estimate the theoretical error originating from the energy dependence of the production operator , neglecting for the moment the inelastic contributions .",
    "in order to do this one has to investigate the contribution to the dispersion integral from the left - hand cuts .",
    "we follow here the procedure utilized in @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the left - hand singularities of the amplitude , i.e. singularities in some momentum transfer variable @xmath47 .",

    "[ diagram ] denoting the exchange of one nucleon and one pion ( one should add , of course , the diagram with proton and nucleon interchanged and @xmath113 replaced by @xmath114 ) . clearly , there are also other more complicated production mechanisms that will contribute . however , those should be of even shorter range and thus , correspond to production operators with even weaker energy dependence so that they are not relevant for the estimation of the theoretical error .",
    "we consider for simplicity kinematics corresponding to the final particles produced not far away from threshold ( so that the momenta of the final particles are small compared to the momentum transfer ) .",
    "the required initial cm momentum is then @xmath115 mev / c .",
    "the production operator contains a cut corresponding to the @xmath116 intermediate state , which can be associated with the interaction in the @xmath117 system discussed above .",
    "the other cut over the neutron and @xmath118 is the one we are interested in .",
    "we can very roughly estimate the energy dependence associated with this singularity via approximating it by a pole term , @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the corresponding 4-momenta and @xmath122 is the effective invariant mass of the @xmath123 system , i.e. @xmath124 gev . for threshold kinematics ( i.e. zero momentum of all final particles ",
    "this choice is made for definiteness ) this energy dependence ( after averaging over all directions ) has the form @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the cm momentum in the @xmath3 system and @xmath127 is of the order of @xmath128 gev .",
    "the correction to the scattering length due to such an energy dependence of the amplitude amounts to @xcite @xmath129 fm for values of @xmath130 mev .",
    "the above rough estimation is sufficient to observe that the error coming from the energy dependence of the production operator is negligible as compared to the other sources of uncertainties and we can savely assume that @xmath131 note that since the @xmath3 scattering length is expected to be somewhat smaller than @xmath132 @xcite we choose @xmath133 mev rather than @xmath134 mev ( used for @xmath32 scattering ) as our central value in order to minimize the effect of higher energy scattering . as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath135 must be chosen well above @xmath136 ( cf . also the discussion in sect .",
    "[ method ] ) .",
    "although a further increase of @xmath135 can help even more in reducing this effect , in reality it would be difficult in this case to separate @xmath28-waves from higher partial waves in the final state and to avoid the influence of the interaction in other channels  the effects and the number of inelastic channels would increase .",
    "next we consider the error coming from the inelastic channels coupled to the @xmath3 system . for simplicity",
    "we consider only the one nearest to the @xmath3 threshold , namely @xmath4 , which opens only about @xmath137 mev above the @xmath3 threshold so that it is necessary to analyze its impact .",
    "clearly , due to the lack of empirical information on the @xmath4 interaction and the coupling of this channel to the @xmath3 system such an error analysis can not be done in a completely model - independent way .",
    "one has to make some assumptions on the strength of the interactions in the relevant channels .",
    "for our analysis we prepared three variants of the hyperon - hyperon interaction of @xcite which yield @xmath79 scattering lengths of @xmath138 fm , @xmath139 fm , and @xmath140 fm , respectively .",
    "we are interested in the situation when the effect coming from the inelastic channel is small and its contribution can be treated perturbatively , i.e. @xmath141 if this is not the case the error of the extraction of the scattering length would be comparable with the scattering length itself and then an extraction would no longer be meaningful .",
    "we made a subtraction in eq .",
    "( [ frazer ] ) at @xmath100 so that @xmath142 is exactly zero at the beginning of the integration interval .",

    "since the @xmath3 system is a pure isospin @xmath12 state , the @xmath181 @xmath4 interaction is also elastic and , thus , permits a determination of the corresponding scattering length via our method .",
    "the first inelastic channel , @xmath182 , opens at the excess energy of around 52 mev and , therefore , should affect the extraction of the scattering length less than what has been discussed in the context of the @xmath3 case above .",
    "the required @xmath4 invariant mass spectrum is accessible experimentally in the reaction @xmath183 , for example .",
    "however , since @xmath4 can occur in the @xmath8 as well as in the @xmath29 partial wave , one needs data from an experiment with polarization for a separation of the singlet and triplet contributions .",
    "the relevant observables are discussed in appendix  [ observ ] .",
    "in addition , one has to keep in mind that the reaction @xmath184 might be dominated by the quasi - elastic process @xmath185 , similar to what happened for the reaction @xmath186 @xcite with @xmath187 . in such a case",
    "the reaction kinematics has to be chosen rather carefully in order to suppress the contributions from the quasi - elastic process , as studied in detail in @xcite , which certainly increases the difficulties for a corresponding experiment .    as a subtlety",
    "let us mention that even in the @xmath188 system the scattering length for @xmath29 is real , although the amplitude is actually the sum of @xmath12 and @xmath181 states .",
    "because of the pauli principle , the @xmath29 partial wave of the @xmath3 system is forbidden so that there is no coupling between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels for the partial wave in question .",
    "experimental information on the @xmath4 invariant mass spectrum is scarce @xcite .",
    "results published in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath189 case , obtained from a @xmath190 bubble - chamber experiment , suggest an enhancement in the invariant mass distribution - but at around 2480 mev and not near the @xmath4 threshold which is at around 2255 mev . in any case , the statistics is too low for drawing any conclusions . the situation is better for an experiment performed at saclay  @xcite where the missing mass ( @xmath191 ) in the reaction @xmath192 at 1.4 gev / c was studied .",
    "the curve presented in this publication exhibits a rather smooth behaviour around the @xmath4 threshold which suggests that the @xmath193 interaction in the @xmath8 and/or @xmath29 might be fairly weak .",
    "such a conjecture is actually in line with the results of several of the potential models summarized in table  [ table2 ] which predict rather small @xmath193 scattering lengths .",
    "we want to emphasize , however , that there are also models with a fairly strong @xmath4 interaction .",
    "noteably the latest nijmegen potential ( esc08a  ) produces bound states in the @xmath29 partial wave of the @xmath12 and @xmath181 channels @xcite .",
    "the binding energies are comparable to that of the deuteron and , accordingly , sizeable near - threshold enhancements in the corresponding invariant mass spectrum are to be expected if such bound states indeed exist in nature .    besides the @xmath4 system the @xmath194 channel @xmath195 is potentially interesting too because it is also elastic . but",
    "due to the charge it can not be produced with a @xmath196 beam on the deuteron .",
    "however , the @xmath197 system which is likewise @xmath194 could be studied , namely in the reaction @xmath198 . also in this case , only the @xmath8 partial wave is present so that no polarization data are required for a determination of the scattering length .",
    "contrary to @xmath193 , here practically all model predictions for the @xmath195 ( @xmath197 ) scattering length are fairly large , cf . table  [ table2 ] .",
    "details of the application of our method to cases where the coulomb interaction is present can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in principle",
    ", one can even consider reactions of the type @xmath199 and @xmath200 , which would give access to the strangeness @xmath1 world .",
    "potential - model calculations @xcite and also predictions obtained within the framework of @xmath15eft @xcite suggest that the interaction in some of the channels are strongly attractive so that the corresponding scattering lengths could be large .",
    "clearly , here it would be desirable to have at least a rough estimation of the count rates that one can expect in order to judge the feasibility of such experiments .",
    "independently of that , also for these reactions we provide and discuss the relevant polarization observables that are needed for a separation of the singlet and triplet contributions , cf .",
    "appendix  [ observ ] .",
    "we reviewed a method that allows one to extract hadronic scattering lengths from production reactions by studying final - state interactions .",
    "in particular , we discussed its applicability to the case of baryon - baryon interactions in the strangeness @xmath0 and @xmath1 sectors .",
    "we emphasized the importance of separating different spin states of the interacting particles .",
    "considering as examples the reactions @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 , we could demonstrate that it is possible to construct polarization observables that provide access to spin - singlet and spin - triplet scattering lengths . in case of the @xmath3 and @xmath195 ( or @xmath197 ) interactions near threshold",
    "only the @xmath8 partial wave is present due to the pauli principle and , thus , no polarization experiments are required for determining the pertinent scattering length from the final - state interaction . employing the method to available data on the @xmath3 invariant mass from @xmath7 @xcite , a @xmath8 scattering length of @xmath9 fm",
    "is deduced .",
    "the error given here reflects the accuracy of those data .",
    "thus , it would be important to perform experiments with better statistics which could be done , e.g. , at j - parc @xcite .",
    "this would then allow one to reduce the error on the @xmath3 scattering length to the one of the extraction method , which we estimate to be in the order of @xmath204 fm .",
    "the technique utilized for the hyperon - nucleon interactions in @xcite is applicable also in the case of strangeness @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems .",
    "the necessary condition that baryon - baryon scattering should be elastic up to some @xmath205 is satisfied for the following @xmath0 channels : @xmath3 , @xmath195 , @xmath197 , @xmath206 , @xmath193 , and for the @xmath1 channels : @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] for a graphic overview of the kinematics . in what follows we are going to consider as examples @xmath5 , @xmath211 , and @xmath6 scattering in complete analogy with the hyperon - nucleon production reactions studied in @xcite .",
    "the following four types of reactions can be used to produce baryon - baryon states with strangeness @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath212    now we come to the question of separating the spin - triplet and spin - singlet states in the baryon - baryon system . as in the case of the hyperon - nucleon interaction",
    "it is sufficient to consider reactions with polarized initial particles .",
    "we start from the general form for the reaction amplitude in the center - of - mass ( cm ) system for the three processes @xmath213 here @xmath40 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 , and @xmath216 are some functions of @xmath46 and of @xmath44 ( and , in general , of further invariants that are required to specify the kinematics of the reaction ) , where their upper indices indicate whether they correspond to spin - singlet ( @xmath46 ) or spin - triplet ( @xmath47 ) amplitude .",
    "the polarization vectors of the deuteron and photon are denoted by @xmath217 and @xmath218 , respectively .",
    "the spin vectors @xmath219 , @xmath220 are used for the spin - triplet initial and final states , respectively . for the last two reactions we assume the momenta of the final kaons",
    "to be either aligned or anti - aligned with the direction of the initial cm momentum @xmath221 .",
    "this leads to a significant simplification allowing one to separate different spin states . for the reaction @xmath201 such a restriction is not necessary and the momentum of the emitted kaon",
    "is denoted by @xmath222 . for the reaction @xmath223 we assume for simplicity that both emitted kaons go into the same direction @xmath224 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following set of polarization observables @xmath225 where the various @xmath226 s for the @xmath6 initial state are defined in @xcite , and @xmath227 is the unpolarized differential cross section .",
    "@xmath228 and @xmath229 have the same definition also for the @xmath5 initial state , the only difference being the absence of the summation over the photon polarizations .",
    "the observable @xmath230 selects the amplitudes with longitudinal target polarization @xmath231 , whereas @xmath232 , @xmath233 , @xmath234 select the amplitudes with @xmath235 .",
    "in addition @xmath234 contain only that part of the amplitude which is antisymmetric with respect to an interchange of @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "the observables @xmath236 and @xmath237 correspond to the proton - proton induced reaction . here",
    "@xmath238 is the analyzing power and @xmath239 is the spin correlation coefficient for polarized beam and target @xcite , and @xmath152 is the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane .    now inspecting the structure of the reaction amplitudes ( [ amplitude ] ) we can identify the observables that allows one to separate a particular spin state : for the reaction @xmath201 the triplet final state can be singled out by the observable @xmath230 for any direction of the emitted kaon , or one can measure the unpolarized differential cross section for @xmath240 .",
    "the spin singlet state can not be separated . for the reaction @xmath202 the triplet final state",
    "can be separated by measuring @xmath230 .",
    "the observable @xmath234 provides access to the spin - singlet amplitude . for the reaction @xmath203 the observable @xmath230 separates spin - singlet contribution , whereas @xmath232 and @xmath233 separate spin - triplet state . for the reaction @xmath223 the observable @xmath237 separates the spin - triplet contribution , whereas @xmath236 is proportional to @xmath241 with @xmath242 . since the @xmath243 s are even functions of @xmath244 ( due to parity conservation ) , after the integration of @xmath236 over an angular region symmetric with respect to @xmath245 only spin - singlet amplitudes survive .",
