    "the argument for studying strange particle production in heavy - ion collisions as evidence of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation is very simple and was first suggested in 1982  @xcite .",
    "the idea relies on the difference in production rates of strange particles in a hadron gas compared to strange quarks in a qgp . as there are no strange quarks in the in - coming colliding nuclei and strangeness",
    "is a conserved quantity each strange particle produced must be accompanied by a corresponding particle containing an anti - strange quark . in a hadron gas",
    "the energy threshold for strange particle production is high .",
    "the creation of a @xmath0 is predominantly through the reaction @xmath1 + n @xmath2 + k , with a threshold energy requirement of @xmath3530 mev . while that of an @xmath4 requires e@xmath5 @xmath31420 mev .",
    "multi - strange particle creation not only needs a large amount of energy but is also a multi - step reaction as first a singly strange particle and then a multi - strange one must be created .",
    "should the system convert to one whose constituents are quarks and gluons the situation simplifies .",
    "the energy threshold , for strangeness production is now reduced to @xmath3300 mev , or twice the strange quark mass ( a quark / anti - quark pair must be created ) .",
    "thus strange quarks become much more abundant and upon hadronization the relative density of ( multi-)strange particles is significantly enhanced over that resulting from a hadron gas .",
    "it should also be noted that in a qgp system the gluonic degrees of freedom dominate and the cross - section for gg@xmath6 is much larger than the cross - section for s@xmath7 creation in a hadronic gas .",
    "thus , not only is creation energetically favourable but the probability is larger . the greatest enhancement in yields is expected to be for multi - strange anti - particles such as the @xmath8 .",
    "although these arguments are old and simple they are still valid today .",
    "however , studies of strange particle production and spectra are now made to investigate many other topics relevant to heavy - ion collisions and the dynamics of the source produced .",
    "figure [ fig : lightcone ] highlights the important evolution sequences of a collision .",
    "the initial pre - equilibrium phase is dominated by hard scatterings , by which we mean high q@xmath9 collisions of partons .",
    "the physics of this early time is probed by high p@xmath10 particles and jet phenomenology .",
    "much progress has been made in this area especially , through the use of strange particles to make identified hadron measurements , and it was the topic of two other sessions at this conference .",
    "therefore , i do not cover high p@xmath10 physics in this paper .",
    "we aim , in the early stages of the collision , to create a temperature that exceeds t@xmath11 , the critical temperature at which a transition to partonic degrees of freedom occurs .",
    "the excited region then expands and cools and drops below t@xmath11 , when hadrons re - form .",
    "it is believed that there is a large amount of re - scattering both in the partonic and hadronic phases and that the system reaches chemical equilibrium . soon after t@xmath11 the system passes through chemical freeze - out , t@xmath12 . at this point",
    "inelastic scatterings cease and the stable hadron ratios are frozen in .",
    "finally kinetic freeze - out occurs when the system cools to below t@xmath13 and elastic collisions also end .",
    "after this the particles free stream to the detectors without any further interaction .        after first briefly ,",
    "in section [ section : tech ] , discussing the experimental and reconstruction techniques used to identify strange particles i have organized this paper along the time - line of a collision as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcone ] . in section [ section : baryonnumber ] , i use the strange hyperon rapidity spectra and anti - particle / particle ratios to probe how incoming protons and neutrons are transported from beam to mid - rapidity as a function of collision energy .",

    "table  [ table : weakdecay ] lists some of the weakly decaying strange particles , their quark content , dominant decay modes and their lifetimes .",
    "as can be seen many of these particles are either neutral or their major decay channel contains a neutral `` daughter '' particle , and they have lifetimes of only a few cm . thus the majority of strange particles are identified via their decay topologies .",

    "the decay point of the mother particle is located via the secondary vertex of the decay .",
    "the decay of the strange particles usually occurs before the tracking detectors active volumes , hence a visual identification of the vertex is not possible and reconstruction via combinatorial methods is employed .",
    "the decay topologies come in three distinct types and are known by the pattern they are identified via : the  v0 \" , the  cascade \" , and the  kink \" .",
    "these methods are described below in turn .",
    "this pattern is produced by the decay of a neutral particle into two charged  daughters \" .",
    "the neutral particle leaves no ionization trail , but upon its decay a  vee \" appears in the chamber as two oppositely charged tracks apparently appear from nowhere .",
    "reconstruction of these decay modes generally proceeds via the following process .",
    "all oppositely charged tracks are paired and projected towards the primary collision vertex .",
    "the two trajectories are compared to see if they appear to cross at a point before the primary vertex .",
    "if so these two tracks are considered candidates for a `` v0 '' decay .",
    "the momentum components of the two charged daughters , at the now assumed decay point , are then used , assuming of the daughter particles masses for the decay of interest , to calculate the mother s invariant mass using eqn .",

    "@xmath17 @xmath18 if the identified tracks do indeed originate from the decay of the desired mother the invariant mass calculation will result in the correct mass , within the momentum resolution of the tracking detectors .",
    "the `` cascade '' decay is similar to the `` v0 '' except there are now two decay vertices .",
    "typically the mother decays first into a charged particle and a neutral one , which subsequently decays further into two charged daughters .",
    "thus the decay creates a cascade of charged particles .",
    "the reconstruction of the `` cascade '' decay occurs in a two step manner .",
    "first the decay vertex of the neutral daughter is reconstructed using the `` v0 '' technique just described , and the mass and momentum components of the particle are determined .",
    "this neutral particle is then combined with all appropriately charged tracks for the mother s decay mode and another secondary vertex is sought . again",
    "the invariant mass is calculated assuming the masses and momenta of the decay products at the secondary vertex .    in a heavy - ion collision , where many charged particles are produced ,",
    "these two techniques produce an enormous amount of random combinatorial background candidates which must be eliminated .",
    "this is done by applying various geometrical cuts to the each candidate .",
    "for instance , the parent should appear to be consistent with a particle being emitted from the primary collision point .",
    "the various daughter tracks should not have such trajectories .",
    "another common requirement is that the secondary vertex occur more than a specified distance from the primary vertex . while this eliminates many true decay vertices it commonly removes more background than signal .",
    "as this cut is typically of several cm s , it is obvious that the efficiency for strange particle reconstruction is low , of order a few percent .",
    "nevertheless these methods are very successful at identifying clean signals as shown in the invariant mass plots for @xmath0 and @xmath19 from star in fig .",

    "this reconstruction technique is only used when the lifetime of the parent is long and there is a high probability of the parent leaving a signal in the tracking chambers .",
    "firstly all charged tracks appearing to emanate from the primary vertex are considered .",
    "these tracks are studied to see if their ionization paths terminate within the chamber .",
    "if such candidates are found all tracks of the same charge , whose ionization paths appear to start further away from the primary vertex than that of the now candidate parent , are considered . the two tracks are projected towards one another to see if they cross .",
    "if so this pair of tracks are considered to be a decay candidate .",
    "an invariant mass analysis is not possible with this technique as the neutral particle in the decay is not identified , hence the charged track appears to suddenly `` kink '' within the detector .",
    "as this technique is most commonly used to identify charged kaon decays , the main source of background is the pion decay .",
    "kinematics force the pion to decay with a very small angle , so by insisting that the decay fall within a certain window in decay angle , and applying other geometrical cuts , the kaon can be cleanly identified .",
    "all these techniques while having low efficiencies have an advantage over other direct particle identifications , such as de / dx and tof , in that they can be applied over large p@xmath10 ranges .",
    "the limit is generally the available statistics which can always be redressed through more beam time .",

    "this baryon number becomes distributed across the whole collision region and hope to gain further insight . at top rhic energies",

    "what strangeness there is can be evenly distributed through the system however so the system can be thought of as in equilibrium , but the strangeness phase space will not be saturated .",

    "there is an apparent limiting temperature reached , which is very close to the critical temperature , t@xmath11 of 170 mev , predicted from lattice qcd calulations@xcite .",
    "it is surprising however to see that statistical models appear to work even for elementary collisions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tchsystematics ] , so we should treat the results with caution . to understand how this could be possible",
    "it should be remembered that all these data sets represent the yields of particles from an event ensemble average .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the fits do not represent true temperatures and chemical potentials but are instead the lagrange multipliers that will result from a fit to any statistically sampled data set .",
    "these fits will only have physical meaning if each individual event can be thought of as a statistically independent system .",
    "we therefore need to establish at what collision energy , if any , state occurs and thus phase space considerations become important .",
    "statistical models utilize grand canonical ensemble statistics , which is only appropriate when the system becomes large . in the grand canonical approach",
    "quantum numbers need only be conserved on average",
    ". thus one can think of creating an @xmath49 without explicitly creating , at that moment , matching particles containing 3 @xmath7 quarks .",
    "ultimately all quantum numbers have to be conserved but at each step , when the grand canonical limit is reached , the system can temporarily  pick up the slack \" .",
    "this leads to an interesting effect upon strangeness production .",
    "in small systems , or the canonical regime , all quantum numbers have to be conserved explicitly , this means there not only has to be energy available for strangeness creation but also the phase space .",
    "a small system therefore results in a suppression of strangeness , due to a lack of available phase space in which to create the quarks . once the volume is sufficiently large this phase space suppression disappears and the amount of strange particle creation per unit volume becomes constant .",
    "the volume of the system is believed to be directly proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "although this is technically a suppression in smaller systems it is often referred to as an `` enhancement '' in more central a+a collisions .",

    "this result goes against our understanding of how canonical suppression is related to collision energy .",
    "calculations have shown that the enhancement for @xmath19 should be much higher at 8.8 than at 17.3 gev .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this discrepancy .",
    "one could be that the assumed linear relationship between correlation volumes and @xmath27 is incorrect .",
    "another is that the temperature of the source reached in the lower energy collision is not that assumed in the calculations , the enhancement factors being very sensitive to this temperature .    to try and gain further insight we turn to the rhic measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : starenhance ] shows the preliminary measured enhancement factors for strange hyperons from star .",
    "we see that for this data set the @xmath0 hyperons show no sign of reaching a plateau . as the sps data appeared to saturate it is perhaps possible that the rhic data shows an over population of strangeness in the @xmath0 channel .",
    "however , figure [ fig : gammas ] , shows that the @xmath46 factor only just reaches unity for the most central data .",
    "this indicates that the system at rhic is only just reaching the grand canonical ensemble limit for the most central collisions .",

'' remains .",

    "the results of such fits can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : starflow ] . a common fit to the @xmath1 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 spectra yields a good representation of the data with t@xmath13 = 89 @xmath25 10 mev and @xmath57 = 0.59 @xmath25 0.05 c. the @xmath19 and @xmath26 spectra however are much steeper , indicating a hotter freeze - out temperature .",

    "this suggests that the multi - strange baryons freeze - out thermally at an earlier time than the lighter particles . at this stage",
    "the source is hotter and the radial flow is lower ; it has not yet had sufficient time to build up to its final value .",
    "the t@xmath13 of multi - strange baryons calculated from the blastwave model is very close to that calculated by the statistical models for t@xmath12 .",
    "this is an indication that these particles decouple almost instantly upon hadronization , but are already carring a significant radial flow .",
    "it is tempting to conclude that there is radial flow in the system before hadronization , @xmath58 in a partonic phase .",
    "a slightly different interpretation comes from a complete hydrodynamical simulation of the collisions  @xcite . in this work",
    "the authors conclude that the multi - strange baryons do not freeze - out at a significantly different time or with a different radial flow velocity",
    ". however , the key point that there is an intrinsic radial flow already , built up previous to hadronization is also one of their conclusions .",
    "in summary i have shown that strange particle production and dynamics are key to understanding the source created in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the yields of strange baryons and mesons suggest a source that is in chemical equilibrium for the most central a+a collisions and that at rhic this source displays strangeness saturation .",
    "the net - baryon number decreases smoothly with collision energy and is close to zero at rhic .",
    "the scale of the baryon transport has a strong effect on the rapidity distributions of strange hyperons , which means that interpreting mid - rapidity yields should be done with caution .",
    "an enhancement of strange baryons per participant is observed in a+a collisions when compared to @xmath23 at the same energy .",
    "this `` enhancement '' is most probably due to a phase space suppression of the @xmath23 data .",
    "obtaining such an enhancement requires a mechanism for fast saturation of the strangeness phase space which hadronic transport models can not provide via the re - scattering of hadrons .",
    "the dynamics of the multi - strange particles suggest a sequential freeze - out after hadronization that depends on the hadronic cross - sections . thus the multi - strange particles appear , in a blastwave scenario , to freeze - out kinetically very close to the chemical freeze - out boundary .",
    "while this result relies on the validity of the blastwave approach both this method and a full hydrodynamical model calculate that the source created must have a sizeable radial flow during the pre - hadronic stage .",
    "all these results , combined with those of the high p@xmath10 regime and v@xmath15 measurements , can be taken a strong evidence of a system which , in the early phases , shows strong collective motion , is very dense and has properties consistent with partonic degrees of freedom ."
