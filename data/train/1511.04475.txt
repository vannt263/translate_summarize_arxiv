    "the knowledge of the solvation free energy ( sfe ) allows one to predict the behavior of substances in solution .",
    "classical density functional theory ( dft ) is a perspective method for sfe calculations which in one hand can reproduce reasonably well the microscopic structural properties of the solvent and in the other hand is two to four orders of magnitude faster than all - atoms simulations .",
    "sfe in classical dft is calculated by minimizing a free - energy functional of the solvent density distribution only @xcite .",
    "this requires only moderate computational effort . for many systems of interest",
    "the calculations takes less than a minute on a standard computer@xcite .",
    "however , despite their attractiveness , the dft and related integral equation ( ie ) methods were not used for the sfe calculations until recently because impaired by computational errors .",
    "for example , it was reported that one of the most popular hyper - netted chain ( hnc ) approximation dramatically overestimates the sfe , sometimes by 200 - 300 recently it was shown also that the classical dft and related 3d - rism methods can be corrected by using empirical partial molar volume ( pmv ) corrections @xcite . however , the question of their universality and transferability is still open . in a recent paper",
    ", we gave a physically - based rationale for the pmv corrections within the classical dft formalism@xcite .",
    "in that paper we considered two variants of the correction , namely the pure pressure correction ( pc ) that rigorously compensate the overpressure due to the hnc ( or hrf ) approximations and the modified pressure correction ( pc+ ) which contains an additional ( and at this stage ad - hoc ) term .",
    "numerical results for a wide range ( 500 + ) of solutes suggest that the pc+ correction is more accurate , and that it could be used in practical applications .",
    "the same conclusions are supported by a series of independent investigators who used the pc+ correction in their calculations @xcite .    in a recent paper ,",
    "misin et al . tested the applicability of both the pc and pc+ corrections to 3d - rism calculations for a large set of organic solutes of various nature@xcite .",
    "they come to the paradoxical conclusion that in the 3d - rism case the pc correction leads to more accurate results than the pc+ . in that paper , however , no satisfactory explanations of this paradox are given .",
    "in the present paper we show that the difference in the 3d - rism and classical dft results can be explained by the difference in expressions of the pressure in these models .",
    "this hypothesis is further checked by performing a series of sfe calculations for a data set of molecules and for a model hydrophobic solute . in the next section ,",
    "we derive the formal definition of the pressure correction ( pc ) and modified pressure correction ( pc+ ) in the mdft framework from new arguments .",
    "then , we discuss sfe calculations using both mdft and 3d - rism . finally , we derive the 3d - rism equations in the functional form and give the expression for the pressure in the 3d - rism model .",
    "this allows us to derive the correct pc and pc+ expressions for the 3d - rism method and to explain the discrepancy previously reported between mdft and 3drism results .",

    "the gibbs solvation free energy @xmath7 can be written as @xmath8 although derived in ref.@xcite through a number of equations in different thermodynamic ensemble , the pressure correction in the calculation of @xmath7 by classical dft can be rephrased with very simple arguments .",
    "if we assume that classical dft can reproduce reasonably well the solvent structure around the solute , we can expect that the structure - dependent components of the solvation free energy , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are calculated with reasonable accuracy . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that the models based on the homogeneous reference fluid approximation ( hrf , or equivalently hnc approximation in integral equations ) fail to predict the pressure .",
    "consequently , the @xmath11 term is incorrect @xcite .",
    "the pressure correction , pc , boils down to eliminate the inaccurate @xmath11 term of dft and to replace it with the correct , experimental pressure term .",
    "accounting furthermore for the fact that density functional theory is formulated in the grand - canonical ensemble with the grand potential @xmath12 , and that the solvation process implies @xmath13 , we simply replace the wrong pressure by the experimental pressure .",
    "@xmath14 in experiments or liquid simulations performed at atmospheric pressure ( 1 atm @xmath15 kcal / mol per @xmath16 ) , the @xmath17 term is negligibly small for solutes below micro - metric size and can be safely omitted .",
    "one thus gets the pc formula @xmath18 note that the above equations rely on macroscopic thermodynamics and are strictly true for a macroscopic solute of volume @xmath6 .",
    "they raises the question of the proper definition of the partial molar volume for a microscopic solute .",
    "numerical experiments for small molecular solutes have suggested that the addition of an extra @xmath19 correction can further improve the results in many cases .",
    "that is our pc+ correction @xcite .",
    "this is also equivalent to reducing the classical dft pressure by an amount equal to the ideal pressure , @xmath20 : @xmath21 we note that despite some arguments in ref.@xcite , there is no clear justification for such factor and it even becomes contradictory for hydrophobic solutes of nanometer size ( see next section ) . at this stage , it should be considered as an empirical adjustment of either the pressure , or of the solute partial molar volume at fixed pressure , for solutes of microscopic sizes .    in the hrf ( or hnc ) approximation , which is commonly used in the dft approach ,",
