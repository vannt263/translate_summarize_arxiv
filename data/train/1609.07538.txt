    "practically all observed blazar radiation is produced in their relativistic jet .",
    "therefore , it is naturally to expect that not only physical processes occurred in the jet ( for instance , passage of a shock wave * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are responsible for the flux density variability but also geometric effects .",
    "the latter ones lie in the fact that the received radiation flux density has a power - law dependence on the doppler factor which value is sensitive to a jet component speed and an angle between direction of the component motion and the line of sight ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , taking into account data obtained from the multi - wavelength photometric and radio interferometric observations we can conclude about the jet structure and motion nature of its components .",
    "this was implemented in the paper on the assumption that long - term variability is caused by variations of the doppler factor .",
    "the bl lac object s5  0716 + 71 [ @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite ] has been intensively observed in the radio , optical , x - ray and @xmath1-ray ranges ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is a very variable source on both short @xcite and long - term @xcite time scales . for more than ten years this object has been observed by vlbi @xcite and within the mojave program ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from these data ,",
    "the inner jet position angle @xmath0 was found to vary with a period of about 10 years @xcite .",
    "this is the most easily explained by the fact that the jet has a helical structure .",
    "the geometrical parameters of the helicoid are defined in section  [ sec : geom ] irrespective of processes causing a helical jet and the motion nature of jet components .",
    "the analysis of long - term observations in the radio and optical ranges gives long - term variability periods of 3.3 and 5.6 - 6 years @xcite , respectively .",
    "these values differ between themselves and they are distinct from the variability period of @xmath0 .",
    "the connection between these periods is presented in section  [ sec : period ] . and",
    "it is possible only for non - ballistic motion of jet components . in terms of the assumption about the helical jet ,",
    "the following observed properties are explained .",
    "1 .  the alternation of intervals of strong positive and negative correlation between @xmath1-ray flux density of the blazar s5  0716 + 71 and @xmath0 ( section  [ sec : corel ] ) detected by @xcite .",
    "2 .  the contradictory results of kinematic analysis carried out in papers @xcite and the high apparent speed of jet components @xcite ( section  [ sec : kin ] ) .",
    "discussion of the obtained results and conclusions are given in sections  [ sec : disc ] and [ sec : conc ] , respectively .",
    "the blazar s5  0716 + 71 is remarkable because of the fact that the inner jet position angle @xmath0 shows periodic changes in its value @xcite .",
    "thus , variation in @xmath7 of the jet part within 1  mas from the core with a period of @xmath8 years and amplitude of @xmath9 was detected based on observations at frequencies of 5 , 8.4 , 15 , 22  ghz during 1992.7 - 2001.2 @xcite .",
    "@xcite defined the period of 10.9 years and amplitude of @xmath10 for the @xmath0 variation based on observational data obtained at frequencies of 43 and 86  ghz during 1994.5 - 2011.5 .",
    "the precessing jet nozzle is a probable explanation of the @xmath0 periodic variation @xcite .",
    "however , as pointed by @xcite , this may be caused by jet stream instabilities . in both cases",
    "the jet gets a helical structure .",
    "a number of researches are devoted to helical jets .",
    "the precessing ballistic jet was considered for oj  287 @xcite , bl  lac @xcite , 3c  120 @xcite , 3c  279 @xcite . but this model is good for a heavy jet that contains not only electrons but also other heavy particles .",
    "the development of magneto - hydrodynamic instabilities is possible in a light leptonic jet @xcite . in magnetic jets the helical structure",
    "is formed by twisting magnetic field filaments inside and outside the conical jet @xcite .",
    "also plasma has a helical trajectory of motion near the magnetized accretion disk @xcite .",
    "note that the obtained here results do not depend on processes causing the helical jet structure .",
    "jet matter can form uninterrupted helix , e.g. , continuous injection from precessing jet nozzle or all emitted jet resulting from magneto - hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "interrupted helix is arisen by injection of separate matter portions ( plasmoids ) or by shock waves in emission quiet helical jet .",
    "the helical structure moves outward from the core in all cases .",
    "so , we represent the jet by individual components moving with the same speed to retain the helical structure for a rather long time .",
    "this component can be elementary volume in the first case , plasmoid or shock front in the second case .",
    "we assume that the jet matter lies on the surface of an imaginary cone and forms a helix originating at some distance @xmath11 from the cone apex ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_1 ] , top and middle panels ) .",
    "a coordinate system with the beginning at the cone apex is introduced .",
    "note that point o may not coincide with position of the supermassive black hole or position of the jet physical beginning .",
    "the coordinate axes are placed in such a way as to the axis oz is directed along the line of sight and the axis ox  along the projection of the cone axis oa onto the plane of the sky .",
    "the half - opening angle of the cone and angle between cone axis and the line of sight are denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . at each epoch",
    "@xcite detected @xmath0 as a flux density - weighted position angle average of all components in the annular region from 0.15 to 1  mas from the core .",
    "unlike them , for simplicity , we take that the position angle of inner component is measured at the moment of its reaching the distance @xmath14 from the cone apex .",
    "the second value setting the component position on the cone s surface is the azimuth angle @xmath15 which is defined as an angle between planes oxz and oab .",
    "when the jet helix moves outside , the angle @xmath15 of each subsequent component reaching the distance @xmath14 differs from the previous one .",
    "this causes variations in @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath16 the line of sight lies inside the jet helicoid .",
    "then , over the period of @xmath15 variations the value of the inner jet position angle @xmath0 varies by @xmath17 .",
    "this is not in agreement with observational data on the blazar s5  0716 + 71 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper we consider only the case of @xmath18 .",
    "the mean value of the inner jet position angle @xmath19 corresponds to location of the component in the plane oxz .",
    "@xmath20 is the angle between the axis ox and radius - vector of the component projected onto the plane of the sky ( ob@xmath21 at the fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_1 ] ) . as is seen in bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_1 ] , the expression for @xmath20 through @xmath15 , @xmath13 , @xmath12 can be easily obtained from projections oa , ac , bc onto the plane of the sky : @xmath22 where the approximate expression at the right side is obtained within assumption @xmath13 and @xmath23 . and the observed position angle is @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath13 is the angle between initial direction of the parsec - scale jet and @xmath12 is the bend angle of the jet .",

    "several determinations of the s5  0716 + 71 jet angle with the line of sight give an interval of values for @xmath13 from 0.5@xmath32 to 11@xmath32 based on the apparent speed of vlbi / a - jet components @xcite .",
    "but these estimations were made based on observations over a small time interval and they depend on authors notion about the jet .",
    "therefore , we use a value obtained by @xcite . note that almost the same value @xmath13 was obtained by @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath33 from the maximum apparent speed of the jet component that has a radial motion without acceleration and having been observed within the mojave program for no less than 5 epochs . according to ( [ eq : pamax ] ) @xmath34 .",
    "when determining jet opening angles by vlba - maps of the sources @xcite obtained a value of @xmath35 for s5  0716 + 71 .",
    "this value determines the angle within which components of parsec - scale jet are situated . in our model",
    "this value is equal @xmath36 .",
    "thus , there is a good agreement between values of half - opening angles of the blazar s5  0716 + 71 jet defined by different independent ways .",
    "the many - year light curves of the blazar s5  0716 + 71 in the radio and optical ranges indicate the existence of long - term variability periods .",
    "@xcite found long - term variability periods in the optical and radio wavebands by applying the discrete fourier transform .",
    "the period of 3.3 years is in the optical @xcite , while 5.6 - 6 years  in the radio band at frequencies of 14.5 and 15  ghz @xcite , 5.8@xmath370.4 at 15  ghz @xcite .",
    "the analysis of data for more than 30-year observation spell at frequencies between 4.8 and 36.8  ghz also shows the existence of both the almost 8-year period and periods of shorter duration @xcite .",
    "therefore , on the one hand , the absence of equal variability periods of radio and optical emission indicates that physical processes occurred in the jet are responsible for brightness variations . on the other hand , periodic changes of the inner jet position angle point to periodic variations of the jet direction",
    "what must be reflected in multi - waveband variability of s5  0716 + 71 .",
    "but this is absent .",
    "let us find out the cause of this contradiction within the assumption about the jet helical structure .",
    "based on observational results ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , regions emitting the received @xmath1-ray and optical emission are at less distance from the black hole than the vlbi / a - core .",
    "this is because the observed @xmath1-ray emission comes from the region which surrounding medium of active nucleus is not transparent for radiation at lesser frequencies . with moving away from the active nucleus , parameters of the surrounding medium change and",
    "the medium becomes optically thin for large wavelength emission @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume that the medium becomes transparent for optical emission of the jet component when this component reaches circle ` 1 ' ( fig .  [ fig : fig_3 ] ) .        .",
    "[ fig : fig_3 ]    this circle is formed by intersecting the cone s surface with plane ` 1 ' which is orthogonal to the cone s axis and placed at the distance @xmath38 from the cone apex .",
    "while further outward moving , the jet component reaches the analogous circle ` 2 ' placed at the distance @xmath39 . in this region",
    "the medium becomes transparent for radio emission .",
    "moving further , the component reaches circle ` 3 ' placed at the distance @xmath40 and appears on vlba - maps as the innermost component to the core .",
    "the @xmath0 is measured at this distance .",
    "we assume that the long - term variability is caused by changes of the doppler factor @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the physical speed of a jet component in units of the speed of light , @xmath43 is the angle between the line of sight and velocity vector of the component . let us introduce a fictitious point moving along circle ` 1 ' ( ` 2 ' or ` 3 ' ) in such a way that its position coincides with position of the jet component intersecting this circle at the certain point of time .",
    "then periods of radio , optical and @xmath0 variability are equal to rotation periods of these fictitious points along circles ` 1 ' , ` 2 ' and ` 3 ' , respectively .",
    "first we consider a case of ballistic motion of jet components . at this case",
    "the velocity vector is directed along cone generator ( see fig .  [",

    "let us assume that the difference of azimuth angles of each two adjacent components is @xmath44",

    "@xcite used data taken over the interval 09.2008 - 10.2010 . by this time , components being inner in 2004 had gone to the outer part of the jet and the inner jet @xmath7 has the minimum value ( see fig .  8 from * ?",
    "thus , for 2008 - 2010 the azimuth angle values of the inner and outer components are about @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively . according to results of kinematics studying of components over the interval 1992.72 - 2001.17 @xcite note that components of the inner jet systematically move slower than that of the outer jet . taking into account",
    "that in 1997 - 1998 the @xmath0 had the minimum values ( see also fig .  8 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this result is in agreement with the following conclusion . in both 2004 and 2008 - 2010 ,",
    "the fast - moving components have the azimuth angle of @xmath153 and slowly - moving components  @xmath154 . at the constant physical velocity @xmath42 of components ,",
    "the @xmath43-angle value affects the value of the apparent speed @xmath155 at the mentioned azimuth angles , the ballistically moving jet components have similar values @xmath156 ( [ eq : cosbal ] ) . for non - ballistic motion ( [ eq : sintheta1 ] ) @xmath157 and @xmath158 ( for @xmath159 ) .",
    "therefore , only in the case of the non - ballistic jet , the discrepancy in azimuth angle values of inner and outer components at different observational epochs naturally explains prima facie contradictory results of the kinematic analysis of the blazar s5  0716 + 71 jet obtained by @xcite and @xcite .    from formulae  ( [ eq : sintheta1]-[eq : bapp ] )",
    "it is seen that @xmath144 also depends on @xmath75 .",
    "[ fig : fig_9 ] shows the dependence of the ratio between apparent speeds of inner and outer jet components on the pitch angle for the epoch 2008 - 2010 @xmath160    .",
    "the graphs are plotted for @xmath42 equal to 0.995 ( 1 ) , 0.999 ( 2 ) , 0.9995 ( 3 ) and 0.9997 ( 4 ) ( the corresponding lorenz - factors are 10 , 22 , 32 and 41 ) . ]    the observed value @xmath161 @xcite is seen to be reachable only if the jet speed is @xmath162 .",
    "wherein , the pitch angles may approximately be equal to 2 , 4.5 , 5.5 and 14@xmath32 . substituting these values into expression  ( [ eq : sintheta1 ] )",
    "we get that only when @xmath163 the @xmath43 varies within the interval from 0.5@xmath32 @xcite to 11@xmath32 @xcite that corresponds to existing estimation of the @xmath43 . when @xmath164 and @xmath165 the high values of @xmath166 are achieved .",
    "these values were detected in the blazar s5  0716 + 71 jet @xcite .",
    "there are many researches showing that the jet helical structure can be produced either as a result of the black hole precession or the action of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities @xcite . the apparent motion of superluminal jet components and long - term brightness variations are accounted for by the helical jet arising as a result of the black hole precession @xcite .",
    "the shape of spectral energy distribution of the blazar mrk  501 and its variations also find explanation under the assumption about the helical jet @xcite .",
    "the two - peaked light curve of the blazar oj  287 is interpreted by a double helical jet that originates from precession in the binary black hole system ( one of the first investigation * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is naturally to assume that the blazar s5  0716 + 71 has a helical jet .",
    "this is confirmed by the observed periodic change of the inner jet position angle @xmath0 @xcite . from the analysis of the optical light curve @xcite",
    "conclude about the precessing blazar s5  0716 + 71 jet . for a good explanation of the multi - wavelength behaviour of s5  0716 + 71 opt/@xmath1 flares @xcite and @xcite suppose that a shock wave moves along the bent , possibly , helix , trajectory . in this paper , taking into account the period and amplitude of the @xmath0 variations @xcite , we obtain geometrical parameters of the imaginary cone with jet matter on its surface ( section  [ sec : geom ] ) .",
    "this result does not depend on the fact whether jet components move ballistically or not .",
    "the found value of the cone s half - opening angle agrees well with the jet opening angle defined from vlba - maps @xcite . on the one hand , this confirms the validity of our assumption about the jet geometry . on the other hand",
    ", this proves that geometric effects affect substantially the variability of emission flux density from s5  0716 + 71 .",
    "@xcite come to the same conclusion based on the analysis of long - term data on optical variability .",
    "they report that , first , the optical color index weakly correlates with brightness ; second , the amplitude of variability is proportional to the magnitude what can be easily explained by variations of the doppler factor .",
    "also , different values of the apparent speed of jet components and difference of their position angles evidence in favour of the geometric interpretation of long - term variability of the blazar s5  0716 + 71 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that there is a contrary conclusion as well .",
    "based on b- , v- , r- optical observations @xcite detected that s5  0716 + 71 shows the blue - when - brighter chromatism what is attributable to variability caused by shock waves passing downstream along the jet flow .",
    "however , the color index behaviour requires further comprehensive study as it can be influenced by differences in step and amplitude of variability at different frequencies .    from the analysis of radio and optical variability @xcite ,",
    "periods shorter than the @xmath0 variation period are detected , 3.3 and 5.8 years , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the variation period of each of the listed three values does not reveal itself in variations of two other values . within the helical jet model their agreement between themselves is possible only when the angle @xmath75 between the features speed vector and cone generator exists .",
    "it has been obtained that the ratio of the observed periods is equal to the ratio of the corresponding distances @xmath14 from the cone s apex to the jet region where the corresponding value becomes accessible for observations . comparing periods of radio and optical emission and @xmath0 variations we have three independent equations for @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and their solutions",
    "are in good agreement .",
    "furthermore , suggesting that @xmath0 is measured at the same angular distance from the vlba - core equal to 0.5  mas and taking into account that 1  mas corresponds to 4.421  pc we have estimated the physical distance from the vlba - core to the cone s apex .",
    "the found value agrees with the distance from the vlba - core to the black hole obtained on measurements of the vlba - core shift based on observations at different radio frequencies @xcite . that is from the variability periods we obtained evidences in favour of the helical structure of the s5  0716 + 71 jet and non - ballistic motion pattern of its components.the latter",
    "is also confirmed by the detected non - radial motion of vlbi - jet components @xcite .    in section  [ sec : period ]",
    "we come to a conclusion that the angle @xmath75 is not equal to the angle between the tangent to the jet matter and cone generator at the given point ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig_5 ] ) .",
    "the difference of the mentioned angles causes rotation of the jet helix around its axis when the helix moves away from the core .",
    "such a rotating helical jet is suggested by @xcite to interpret the observed alternation of intervals of strong positive and negative correlation between @xmath0 values and @xmath1-ray flux density .",
    "we have shown that both ballistic and non - ballistic jets ( section  [ sec : corel ] ) satisfy the observed picture of correlation .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath1-rays are produced at smaller distance from the black hole than distance corresponding to the observed position of the vlbi - core ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and especially distance of the feature for which @xmath0 is measured .",
    "therefore it is quite possible that there is a difference between azimuth angles @xmath15 ( @xmath15 indicates the feature orientation relative to a plane containing the line of sight and cone s axis ) of these two jet regions for the same observation time .",
    "this difference strongly affects both the correlation coefficient @xmath115 of the mentioned values and duration of the interval when this @xmath115 is observed .",
    "the contradictory results of kinematic studies of the s5  0716 + 71 jet @xcite are also easily explained by the helical jet model . according to @xcite , the stationary components observed by @xcite are to be explained by the bent jet trajectory , and fast - moving components",
    "@xcite can be caused by shock waves passing along the jet . in section  [ sec : kin ]",
    "we show that available differences in the apparent speed @xmath144 of components at different observational epochs @xcite are caused by difference in their azimuth angles .",
    "the ratio of @xmath144 allows us to define the angle @xmath75 at which the component moves relative to the cone generator and to estimate the physical speed of jet components @xmath42 .",
    "it has been obtained that in the case of the non - ballistic jet the angle between the component velocity vector and the line of sight @xmath43 can reach small values ( parts of a degree ) what at a certain value @xmath42 leads to the observed high apparent speeds of components @xcite .",
    "such a small @xmath43 value can not be obtained for the ballistic jet with geometric parameters estimated in section  [ sec : geom ] , just as and the maximum value estimated at 11@xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we suggest the helical structure of the blazar s5  0716 + 71 parsec - scale jet .",
    "it allows us :    * to explain periodic variations of the inner jet position angle @xmath0 , the long - term flux variability in the radio and optical ranges ; * to coordinate different periods of long - term variability of the mentioned values between themselves ; * to explain alternation of time intervals of positive and negative correlation between the @xmath1-ray flux and @xmath0 ; * to bring into agreement available contradictory results of kinematic studies of the s5  0716 + 71 jet components ; * to explain the high apparent speed of jet components .",
    "* helical jet matter is located on the surface of the imaginary cone with the half - opening angle @xmath170 and angle between the cone axis and the line of sight @xmath171 .",
    "this result does not depend on the motion nature of jet components ; * distance from the vlba - core to the cone s apex is about 2.5  pc ; * non - ballistic motion of jet components with the pitch angle @xmath163 .",
    "this gives greater interval of possible values of the @xmath43 than for ballistic motion where @xmath172 ; * low constraint on the physical speed of jet components @xmath173 ; * it was concluded that the pitch angle differs from the angle @xmath76 between the tangent to the helix and the cone generator at the given point .      * it does not depend on mechanisms forming the helix ; * it self - consistently explains different observed properties of the blazar s5  0716 + 71 and its jet ; * the model may be applied to other blazars having both similar and different properties as compared to s5  0716 + 71 .",
    "for example , a constant value of @xmath0 can be caused by either @xmath174 or insufficient flux density for recording jet components which velocity vector makes up larger angle with the line of sight .",
    "thus , the helical jet gives the interpretation of different observed properties of s5  0716 + 71 .",
    "herein , estimations of the half - opening angle of the jet s cone and distance of the vlba - core from the black hole are in agreement with other independent estimations carried out by @xcite .",
    "hence , variations of the doppler factor strongly affect the long - term variability of the blazar s5  0716 + 71 .",
    "it is generally accepted that in this case the period of light curve variability , with relativistic effects taking into account , reflects periodic processes occurring near the supermassive black hole ( or binary black hole system ) .",
    "but in this paper we show that the motion of jet components influences duration of the variability period . in the case of the ballistic jet",
    "there is an increase of the period as the observational frequency decreases when the jet slows down .",
    "when components move at some pitch angle @xmath75 then the period can be either absent at all ( when @xmath79 ) or increases even without a decrease in the physical speed of jet components ( when @xmath80 ) .",
    "this is important to take into account when estimating physical parameters of the core , e.g. black hole mass .",
    "the helical jet also complicates a correlation picture of two different observed values and makes it strongly dependent on the jet geometry what hinders the detection of physical connection between these values .",
    "the study of correlation between radio and @xmath1-ray variability ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allows detecting locations of emitting regions .",
    "in addition , the jet geometry must also be taken into account .",
    "note that from figures  [ fig : fig_7 ] and  [ fig : fig_8 ] , the correlation can not be entirely absent .",
    "if it is observed then physical processes make a key contribution to variations of the studied values ."
