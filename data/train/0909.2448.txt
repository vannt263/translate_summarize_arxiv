    "star formation ( sf ) is responsible for most of those galaxy properties that we can currently measure out to high @xmath1 : luminosities , spectral energy distributions , morphologies .",
    "understanding the history and physics of sf is fundamental for the understanding of baryons in galaxies , and also for many other fields of astrophysics : the cosmic evolution of gas and metals , the extragalactic background light , and cosmological tests that rely on galaxies clustering and number densities to illuminate the evolution of dark matter structure .",
    "studies of sf histories have been dramatically advanced by the recent arrival of deep , multi - wavelength surveys like goods , aegis and cosmos .",
    "their sensitivity allows to observe all galaxies down to masses below typical @xmath2 systems out to @xmath0 , providing a comprehensive picture of their evolution .",
    "their variety of multi - wavelength data , especially the spitzer irac and mips @xmath3 data , have much improved the measurements of sf rates ( sfr ) and stellar masses ( @xmath4 ) in distant galaxies , where dust extinction corrections are challenging to measure ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in the following ,",
    "i summarize the first broad - brushed , but comprehensive and new picture of sf in field galaxies that the deep surveys have just revealed : sf was predominantly not driven by an evolution of strong starbursts , but gradually declining on mass - dependent scales @xcite .",
    "this picture ties together some separate key results of the preceding decade , that ( i ) the comoving sf rate ( sfr ) density of the universe has decreased by about an order of magnitude since @xmath5 @xcite , ( ii ) that many distant galaxies had high sfr that are unusual today , and ( iii ) that the average sf history of galaxies is a strong function of their mass @xcite , a phenomenon dubbed `` downsizing '' @xcite .    most of the following discussion is based on the aegis survey @xcite . for more details , see @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the evolution of sfr as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath1 is summarized in figure 1 , adapted from @xcite . shown",
    "are data from the aegis survey from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "sfr are derived from spitzer @xmath3 photometry and deep2 emission lines @xcite , @xmath4 from optical deep2 and nir photometry @xcite . for other sfr tracers and calibrations ,",
    "the results are consistent , with small quantitative systematic differences .",
    "the star - forming galaxies ( blue symbols , predominantly late type morphologies , mostly blue @xmath9 colors ) segregate from those with no measurable sf ( red symbols ; early types ; red @xmath9 colors ) and the galaxies with weak emission lines that are likely to have some residual sf @xcite or to be liner / agn - powered ( purple ; mostly early types ; red @xmath9 colors ) .",
    "see the caption of figure 1 or @xcite .",
    "importantly , the sf galaxies form a defined relation between sfr and @xmath4 over the whole @xmath1 range , with a spread in sfr at a given @xmath4 and @xmath1 that is crudely log - normal with a @xmath10 width of @xmath11dex ( after correction for minimal estimates of sfr errors ) at all @xmath1 .",
    "such a relation had been known at @xmath12 @xcite , and its existence to @xmath0 @xcite was confirmed by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported this relation with a similar spread in sfr at @xmath6 ( cf . also e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "detailed studies at @xmath12 are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while the scatter in sf remains roughly constant at all observed @xmath1 , the above authors find the sfr at a given @xmath4 to decrease by a factor of @xmath13 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 @xcite .    for reasons explained in section [ hrd ] , we nicknamed the sfr-@xmath4 relation the `` galaxy main sequence ( gms ) '' .",
    "the surprising persistence of an equally sharp relation between sfr and @xmath4 out to @xmath6 , or over 10 gyr in lookback time , has profound implications for sf in field galaxies over most of the cosmic time .",
    "these were first discussed in @xcite ( and already in part in @xcite ) , and pertain only to star - forming galaxies on the sfr-@xmath4 relation ( and in the @xmath1-dependent @xmath4 range where we are complete ) , not to those where sf was shut down by still debated processes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "* 1 ) * galaxies of equal mass must have had similar sf histories , else the scatter in sfr along the gms would increase with time .",
    "the smoothness of the dependence of sfr on @xmath4 suggests that we observe a generic mode of galaxy - wide star formation , possibly dominated by the same set of few physical processes over several decades in galaxy mass .    *",
    "2 ) * the @xmath10 spread of sfr at a given @xmath4 and @xmath1 is @xmath17 in log(sfr ) , and remains roughly equally narrow out to @xmath6 .",
    "this finding limits the amplitude and duty cycles of typical variations in sfr that galaxies can have experienced over the past 10 gyr : statistically , a galaxy spent 2/3 of its time within a factor of 2 of its typical sfr at that @xmath1 .",
    "if some galaxies underwent stronger variations , causing much of the observed scatter , then the remaining majority of galaxies must have had even smoother sf histories .",
    "these limits on sfr variations constrain the effect of galaxy interactions on galaxy sfrs ; they are consistent with theoretical predictions of the influence of frequent minor interactions @xcite , and constrain the longer - term ( @xmath18yr ) enhancement of sfr ( e.g. @xcite ) by major mergers to a modest factor .    *",
    "3 ) * the factor by which the sfr along the gms have decreased since @xmath19 ( see section [ ms ] ) is much larger than the amplitude of typical sfr variations .",
    "dominant _ process in the evolution of sf over the past 10 gyr was hence _ a gradual decline of sfr in individual galaxies _ , with at most modest variations that were superposed on that smooth decline .",
    "it is especially noteworthy that these sfr variations seem to have the _ same relative amplitude _ ( factor ) at all @xmath1 : out to @xmath6 , episodic sf variations or starbursts played a minor , barely evolving role in the sf history of the universe , and of typical galaxies .",
    "this result is contrary to the formerly popular hypothesis that the evolution of sf might be driven by increasingly frequent strong starbursts at higher @xmath1 .",
    "the effect of galaxy interactions on sfr has now been measured for galaxies in major and minor mergers , and close pairs ( @xcite ; @xcite , and this conference ; @xcite , and this conference ) .",
    "these studies have consistently shown a mild enhancement of sfr : sfr distributions of interacting samples are shifted to @xmath20 larger values than those of isolated control samples .",
    "this limits the fraction of @xmath4 formed at intermediate @xmath1 to @xmath21 ( @xcite , and this conference ) .",
    "finally , figure 1 ( green line ) reveals the origin of the strong number density increase of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) with @xmath1 : apparently , galaxies become ir - luminous due to their generic , gradual evolution of star formation , where sfr ( and hence likely their dust extinction ) increase with @xmath1 .",
    "this supports studies @xcite that found lirgs at intermediate @xmath1 to have mostly regular , disk - like morphologies and suggested that lirgs are a universal phase in the intrinsic , gradual evolution of many galaxies .",
    "[ fig2 ]    the results i summarized in section [ ms ] reveal a fundamental role of the sfr-@xmath4 relation : because galaxies of equal mass have similar sf histories , they must evolve along similar tracks in the sfr - @xmath4 plane .",
    "the sfr - @xmath4 relation at a given @xmath1 must therefore mark the point on each mass - dependent evolutionary track across the galaxy mass spectrum at that @xmath1 : it is an _ isochrone _ cutting across the evolutionary tracks at a given time .",
    "see figure 2 , where this is shown for the equivalent case of specific sfr vs @xmath4 at different @xmath1 .",
    "this is analog to another important isochrone in astrophysics - the hertzsprung - russell diagram , which is a superposition of the mass - dependent stellar evolutionary tracks . in this picture , the galaxies sfr-@xmath4 relation is the analog of the stellar main sequence , where regular , active evolution , driven by the same set of physical processes in an undisturbed system , proceeds until a change in physics moves the object to its red late stages and passive end stadium ( the `` red and dead '' galaxies ) .",
    "incidentally , the galaxies ` ' main sequence turnoff  occurs systematically earlier for more massive galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , similar to stars .",
    "these similarities led us to adopt the term `` galaxy main sequence '' , and the gms is as fundamental to the understanding of galaxy evolution as the stellar ms to stellar physics : from the gms at different @xmath1 , we can recover the mass - dependent sf histories of galaxies . in @xcite",
    ", we presented a first simple , parametric approach : the evolution of the gms was modeled by simple , smooth model sf histories , justified by the dominance of the smoothly declining component of sf histories ( section [ ms ] ) .",
    "we chose exponential sf histories ( `` @xmath22 models '' ) , given their previous success for many applications ; both parameters , the @xmath23-folding time @xmath22 and the `` formation redshift '' @xmath24 where sf begins , were allowed to depend on the galaxies `` baryonic mass '' as power laws . vs @xmath1 , by keeping track of the stellar mass growth due to a sf history .",
    "these tracks can however easily be linked to actual stellar masses at any observable @xmath1 , through the @xmath4 they generate at a given @xmath1 . ]",
    "this model reproduces the evolution of sfr and @xmath4 on the gms up to @xmath25 remarkably well , and can attribute the scatter of sfr along the gms to scatter in sf history parameters at a given mass ( see @xcite , figure 1 ) , suggesting an even smaller role of episodic or bursty sf .",
    "these @xmath22 models are the first parametrization of the mass - dependent sf histories of galaxies .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath22 models ( colored lines ) in the specific sfr ( sfr normalized by @xmath4 ) vs @xmath4 plane .",
    "it is equivalent to the sfr-@xmath4 plane , essentially with the ms rotated clockwise . for illustration ,",
    "the model gms is extrapolated out to @xmath26 ; note that the models are only constrained by data to @xmath27 .",
    "the evolutionary tracks ( black arrows ) reveal substantial mass growth due to sf with redshift for all but the most massive galaxies , also found by independent methods @xcite .",
    "comparing galaxies of equal @xmath4 at different @xmath1 is therefore generally not justified : one may compare very different objects .",
    "instead , one needs to compare galaxies on the same evolutionary track , i.e. apply a mass correction that can for the first time be inferred from the @xmath22 models discussed above , or future refined parametrizations .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath22 model fits required both @xmath22 and @xmath24 to be mass - dependent : less massive galaxies had not only longer @xmath22",
    ", i.e. a slower decline of sf , sf being less efficient and having lower initial sfrs ; they also had systematically later @xmath24 , equivalent to a later onset of sf .",
    "the observed `` downsizing '' in sf galaxies is apparently a combination of both phenomena .",
    "the late @xmath24 are required to account for the high specific sfr ( sfr/@xmath4 ) of a majority of sub-@xmath28 galaxies at @xmath29 ( see figure 2 in @xcite .",
    "these imply `` doubling times '' much shorter than the age of the universe , i.e. these galaxies can not have formed stars at their observed rate without overproducing their stellar mass .",
    "the usual explanation for high specific sfr , starburst events on top a lower sfr history , is not physical because a majority of all such galaxies would need to simultaneously undergo a stochastic event , and is also in contradiction with other observations - see @xcite for details . in a substantial fraction - but not necessarily all - of less massive galaxies , sf must hence have been inefficient at early times and only attained sustained efficiency later than in more massive galaxies ( cf . figure 3 ) .",
    "this mass - dependence of the onset of efficient sf , dubbed `` staged galaxy formation '' @xcite , is consistent with the observed presence of very old stars  roughly a hubble time  in the majority of local group dwarf galaxies and other resolved systems .",
    "our data on sf to @xmath30 only indicate that sf was inefficient , not absent , in less massive galaxies , allowing for some old stars ; ( ii ) efficient sf only needs to delayed in the majority , but not all of such galaxies ; ( iii ) our data do not probe galaxies down to true dwarf masses .",
    "this systematic delay of efficient of sf in less massive galaxies is not likely to be an artifact of sfr measurement errors .",
    "it is consistent with statistical studies of galaxy sf histories from independent methods - the evolution of stellar mass functions and the fossil record in stellar populations of low @xmath1 galaxies ; cf .",
    "@xcite , especially figure 6 ; @xcite ; @xcite .    [ fig3 ]",
    "the various data on sfr and @xmath4 out to @xmath31 have become an important testbed for theoretical work on galaxy formation , and help to improve the treatment of the complicated and numerically expensive baryon physics .",
    "current models of galaxy populations do generally reproduce the sfr-@xmath4 relation with a slope and scatter similar to the observed one @xcite .",
    "two types of discrepancies seem however to be universal between the data and models : on the one hand , models underpredict the redshift evolution of sfr for galaxies on the gms .",
    "it is currently debated whether this results from systematic errors in sfr measurements at high @xmath1 , problems of model physics , or both @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the delay of efficient sf in less massive galaxies is not correctly reproduced by current models @xcite .",
    "found from independent data and methods ( section [ staging ] ) , this difference is probably physical and likely due to not yet fully understood baryonic physics @xcite that renders sf or its fueling processes inefficient at early times in low mass halos .    while observed galaxy sfr across most of the cosmic time have provided new key information for many purposes , considerable work is still necessary ( and underway ! ) to improve their calibrations and systematics ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , improve restframe ir coverage with herschel , alma and jwst .",
    "in addition , systematics like the adopted stellar imf and extinction curves can be tested from non - standard derivations of sfr @xcite .",
