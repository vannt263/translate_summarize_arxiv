    "the relic gravitational waves must have been generated by strong variable gravitational field of the very early universe @xcite .",
    "we got used to the notion that the generation of gravitational waves requires some sort of a time - dependent quadrupole moment in the energy distribution of matter and fields .",
    "but , by definition , there is no such asymmetries in the distribution of matter and fields comprising a homogeneous isotropic universe .",
    "so , how the relic gravitational waves could come into existence ? in the context of classical gravitational waves ,",
    "the word ` amplification ' is probably a more accurate explanation than the word ` generation ' .",
    "indeed , the pre - existing classical gravitational waves could be amplified in the course of time , because the nonlinear character of gravitation makes them parametrically coupled to the variable gravitational field of the isotropic homogeneous universe ( gravitational pump field ) .",
    "the coupling is strong and effective if and when the variations of the pump field are so fast that the inverse time - scale of variations becomes comparable with the frequency of the wave .",
    "this is when the amplitude of the wave increases over and above the limits of the adiabatic law .",
    "moreover , the phenomenon of relic gravitational waves is more general than this classical picture ; it does not require the previously generated waves and does not rely on their presence .",
    "the reason is that in the quantum world there always exist , even in the absence of classical waves , the inevitable ground ( vacuum ) state fluctuations of the corresponding field .",
    "one can think of these zero - point quantum oscillations as those that are being amplified , as a result of their interaction with the gravitational pump field .",
    "speaking more accurately , the quantum - mechanical schrodinger evolution transforms the initial no - particle ( vacuum ) state of gravitational waves into a multi - particle ( strongly squeezed vacuum ) state . in this sense ,",
    "relic gravitational waves have been generated from ` nothing ' by the external pump field .",
    "this process is called the superadiabatic ( parametric ) amplification . for a recent review of the subject ,",
    "see @xcite .    under certain extra conditions , the cosmological density perturbations ( _ dp _ ) , which combine specific perturbations of the gravitational field and matter fields ,",
    "can also be generated by the same mechanism of superadiabatic ( parametric ) amplification .",
    "this takes place in addition to the generation of gravitational waves ( _ gw _ ) .",
    "the theoretical ingredients describing the independently quantized ` tensor ' ( _ t _ , gravitational waves ) and ` scalar ' ( _ s _ , density perturbations ) degrees of freedom of the perturbed early universe are almost identical .",
    "this results in approximately equal amplitudes of the long - wavelength metric perturbations representing gravitational waves on one side and density perturbations on the other side .",
    "therefore , assuming that the observed anisotropies in cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) are indeed caused by cosmological perturbations of quantum - mechanical origin , one expects that the contributions of density perturbations and gravitational waves to the lower - order cmb multipoles are of the same order of magnitude ( see @xcite and references there ) .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section1 ] we explain the properties of the gravitational field perturbations @xmath7 , and summarize the definitions and notations that will be used in the paper .",
    "we shall be working with the expansion of the field @xmath8 over spatial fourier harmonics @xmath9 , and with the associated fourier coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in the rigorous quantum - mechanical version of the theory , @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "are the annihilation and creation operators acting on the quantum states .",
    "but , to simplify calculations , we are using a ` classical ' version of the theory , whereby @xmath10 and @xmath11 are treated as classical random complex numbers @xmath10 and @xmath12 .    in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] we explain in detail how the statistical properties of the underlying cosmological perturbations , encoded in the probability density functions ( pdf s ) of complex random variables @xmath13 , @xmath14 , translate into the statistical properties of the cmb multipole coefficients @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the statistics of the cmb anisotropies , often referred to in the form of a loose and poetic concept of ` cosmic variance ' , is an important ingredient of the whole problem of deriving cosmological conclusions from the cmb data .",
    "we formulate the pdf s for individual quantities @xmath15 and for the full set @xmath17 of these quantities .",
    "the main emphasis is on the correlation coefficient @xmath18 in the joint pdf for @xmath19 and @xmath20 components of the cmb .    in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] we formulate the pdf s for the best unbiased estimators of the auto - correlation and cross - correlation power spectra .",
    "again , the main emphasis is on the estimator @xmath21 of the @xmath0 power spectrum .",
    "this is because the gravitational waves have a distinctive signature in the region of lower @xmath6 s : the mean value of @xmath21 must be positive for density perturbations and negative for gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the individual outcomes may have signs opposite to the sign of the mean value .",
    "this is why we evaluate the probabilities of finding positive ( negative ) outcomes for @xmath21 in the situation when the expected value of this variable is negative ( positive ) .",
    "the actual numerical amount of the @xmath0 cross - correlation at every @xmath6 is governed by the numerical value of the correlation coefficient @xmath22 . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] we derive @xmath22 for specific cosmological models with various amounts of density perturbations and gravitational waves .",
    "the parameters of the background cosmological model are always taken from the 5-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) best - fit @xmath23cdm cosmology @xcite , but the perturbation parameters are allowed to vary .",
    "the derived coefficients @xmath22 make it possible to build the @xmath6-dependent confidence intervals surrounding the mean value of the estimator @xmath21 .",
    "the inherent uncertainty of the expected cmb signal , ultimately explicable in terms of the quantum - mechanical origin of cosmological perturbations , is exacerbated by the ` real life ' effects , such as instrumental noises , foreground emissions , incomplete sky coverage , etc . in sec .",
    "[ sa4 ] we use the parameters of the wmap and planck missions to show how these effects broaden the size of the confidence intervals .",
    "this allows us to put to the test the existing wmap @xmath0 data and make predictions for the planck mission .",
    "the wmap5 best - fit analysis suggests that the observed cmb anisotropies have no contribution from gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "we call this conclusion the null hypothesis @xmath24 . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] we test the null hypothesis using the wmap5 @xmath0 data .",
    "although the evidence for rejection of @xmath24 is weak , within 1@xmath4 , the data points demonstrate the tendency to lie below the @xmath24 expectation curve , which is actually required by the presence of relic gravitational waves .    since the existence of relic gravitational waves is a necessity dictated by general relativity and quantum mechanics , we include gravitational waves in the @xmath0 data analysis as a compulsory ingredient ( sec .",
    "we consider a class of models which contain gravitational waves and are consistent with the available @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath5 data .",
    "although our physical picture is guided by gravitational waves of quantum - mechanical origin @xcite , the analysis is general and applies to gravitational waves of any origin .",
    "one has to note , though , that classical gravitational waves generated at later stages of cosmological evolution have wavelengths much shorter than the hubble radius and therefore they do not affect the lower - order cmb multipoles .",
    "we build and study the likelihood function for @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is the ratio of @xmath27 and @xmath28 contributions to the temperature quadrupole @xmath29 .",
    "the maximum of the likelihood function turns out to be at @xmath2 .",
    "this number also determines other perturbation parameters in our class of models . because of the large wmap noises , the confidence interval for @xmath1 is quite broad , so that the wmap team s suggestion @xmath3 is only 1@xmath4 away from our maximum likelihood value @xmath2",
    "nevertheless , we consider our best - fit model with @xmath2 as a benchmark model , which we believe is to be confirmed by the more sensitive planck mission .",
    "we numerically simulate the future planck data and show that the relic gravitational waves are to be detected by the @xmath0 method at a better than 3@xmath4 level .",
    "the prospects of the planck mission are discussed at some length in the last sec .",
    "we compare the @xmath0 method with the more often mentioned @xmath5 method .",
    "the @xmath30-mode of polarization does not contain the contribution from density perturbations but is inherently weak and prone to various systematic effects .",
    "we distinguish the ` optimistic ' and ` realistic ' cases in detection of gravitational waves through the @xmath5 correlation function .",
    "it appears that the ` realistic ' @xmath5 case offers a little better than 2@xmath4 detection of relic gravitational waves in the @xmath2 model .",
    "we also show that the @xmath5 method mostly relies on the reionization era , whereas the @xmath0 correlation function is mostly sensitive to the era of recombination .    the conclusions summarize our findings and emphasize the necessity of concentrated efforts in the race for discovery of relic gravitational waves .",
    "let us recall that the gravitational field of a slightly perturbed flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe is described by @xmath31 , \\nonumber \\label{metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32-time and @xmath33-time are related by @xmath34 .",
