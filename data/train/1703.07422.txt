    "the pierre auger observatory measures cosmic rays within an area of 3000 @xmath0 .",
    "the design calls for 1660 water - cherenkov detectors , arranged on a triangular grid , with the sides of the triangles measuring 1.5 @xmath1 , overlooked by four optical stations , each containing six telescopes , designed to detect air - fluorescence light ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the water - tanks(stations ) respond to the particle component ( mainly muons , electrons and positrons ) and the fluorescence cameras measure the emission from atmospheric nitrogen that is excited by the charged particles of the shower as they traverse the atmosphere .",
    "both techniques , already used for many years to study extensive air showers , are brought together in a ` hybrid ' detector to observe showers simultaneously with different techniques[1 ] .",
    "the array of water - tanks is known as the surface detector ( sd ) while the optical stations form the fluorescence detector , are known as fluorescence detector ( fd ) .",
    "+ * figure 1 . * representation of air - shower and current status of the pierre auger observatory .",
    "the goal of this work is to observe the effects of direct light in the tanks which conform the sd , as well as their evolution as a function of time .",
    "the change in time could provide information on the physical state of each tank .",
    "such information can be also used for studying possible systematic effects in the measurements made by the sd .",
    "each sd is a cylindrical water tank with @xmath2 of pure water .",
    "it has a cross section of @xmath3 , a diameter of @xmath4 and a depth of @xmath5 ( see figures 2 and 3 ) . the @xmath6 tanks of the sd are separated 1.5 km from each other . when an ultra - relativistic cr crosses the tank , it produces cherenkov light , that is measured by three photomultipliers ( pmts ) located on the top of each tank .",
    "each pmt has @xmath7 of diameter , these are photonis xp1805 .",
    "the pmts are looking to the water , separated a distance of @xmath8 from the center of the tank , having a @xmath9 of difference in azimuthal angle from each other ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the direct light coming to each pmt is conditioned by the azimuthal angle of the arrival direction the particle which produced the light has . if the light arrives with the same azimuthal angle as the one a certain pmt has , then , the measurement made by that pmt will be higher than the one made by the other two .",
    "such effect can be observed in a graph showing the signal as a function of azimuthal angle , which present a different maximum and phase for each pmt , as is shown in graphs 1 to 4 [ 2 ] .",
    "+ * figure 4 . *  pmt positions on the top of the tank .",
    "a selection of tanks which have been working properly and more or less continuously over time , during the period from 2004 to 2013 , has been made .",
    "also quality cuts for events detected are requested to guarantee that the measurement corresponds to a well reconstructed event .",
    "the results shown in this document are obtained from the analysis of a tank named `` mariana '' with number i d 338 , which presented an event amount of 5673 .",
    "+ each pmt data is plotted as a function of azimuth angle , and an approximation of the signal from each pmt is performed by adjusting a sine function of the azimuth angle with the form : @xmath10 with @xmath11 for the pmt1 .",
    "@xmath12 for pmt2 and @xmath13 for pmt3 .",
    "+ * graph 1 .",
    "*  amplitude 0@xmath14 - 60@xmath14 .",
    "three zenith angle ranges , having the same solid angle , are considered : @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding results , showing the azimuthal effect are shown in graphs 2 to 4 .",

    "*  amplitude 48@xmath14 - 60@xmath14 .",
    "the amplitudes of each pmt are plotted as a function of zenith angle .",
    "the corresponding line is fitted with a function of the form : @xmath16 results for pmt 1 , pmt 2 and pmt 3 are shown in graphs 5 -7 .",
    "* graph 5 .",
    "*  amplitude adjustment for the pmt1 .",
    "+   + * graph 7 . *  amplitude adjustement for the pmt3 .    in order to obtain only one characteristic line for each detector ,",
    "the amplitudes for each pmt at a certain zenith angle are averaged and plotted as shown in graph 8 .",
    "then a new linear fit is performed resulting in the corresponding characteristic line .",
    "+ * graph 8 .",
    "characteristic line of the station .",
    "*    once the characteristic line of the station was obtained for the whole period of time , its change in time is to be explored .",
    "the same study has to be done for three different periods in order to compare the corresponding characteristic lines .",
    "this is work in progress .",
    "from graphs 1 - 4 , it can be seen that the effect of direct light is effectively present for each pmt of of one station in the sd . a characteristic line ,",
    "for the station studied was found .",
    "the next step is to explore signals of the same tank for different time periods in order to study a possible change of the characteristic line as a function of time . if some change is found , its impact in the measured signal has to be studied .",
    "the same kind of study must also be performed for other tanks .",
