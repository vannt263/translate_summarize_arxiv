    "the magnetism of fermi gases has always received considerable attention in solid - state physics , such as localized and itinerant electrons . while the magnetic properties of bose gases has been less studied .",

    "the bose gases plays an important role in understanding some exotic quantum phenomena , such as superconductivity and superfluid .",
    "the ideal charged bosons were used originally to describe the superconductivity .",
    "it has been shown by schafroth @xcite , blatt and butler @xcite that an ideal gas of charged bosons exhibits the essential equilibrium features of superconductor .",
    "although the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory @xcite explained the microscopic nature of conventional superconductivity , the charged bose gas exhibits strong diamagnetism at low temperature , which can be attributed to meissner effect . in recent years",
    ", the normal - state diamagnetism of high - temperature cuprate superconductors has been explained by real - space charged bosons @xcite .",
    "this also recasts new research interest in charged bose gases .    experimentally , since the realization of _ spinor _ bec in optical traps @xcite the magnetic properties of _ spinor _ bose gases has received considerable attention .",

    "the ions can be regarded as charged bosons if their spins are integers .",
    "the lande - factor for different magnetic ions could also be different .",
    "it is known that paramagnetism is from the spin degree of freedom of particles . while charged spinless bose gases can exhibit strong diamagnetism , similar to meissner effect , which comes from the orbital motion of charge degree of freedom in magnetic field .",
    "theoretically , both the paramagnetism @xcite in neutral spin-1 bose gases and the diamagnetism of the charged spinless bose gases @xcite have been studied .",
    "moreover , we @xcite have discussed the competition of paramagnetism and diamagnetism in charged spin-1 bose gases in external magnetic field , using the lande - factor @xmath1 to evaluate the strength of paramagnetic ( pm ) effect .",
    "it is shown that the gas exhibits a shift from diamagnetism to paramagnetism as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the ferromagnetism and superconductivity are not compatible in conventional physical models .",
    "the meissner - ochsenfeld effect shows the conventional superconductor cancels all magnetic field inside when the temperature below the superconducting transition temperature , which means they become perfectly diamagnetic .",
    "the discovery of several ferromagnetic ( fm ) superconductors in experiments @xcite stimulates the research interest in the exotic magnetic properties of fm superconductors . the state of the cooper pairs in the fm superconductors has been wildly studied @xcite . a stronger spin - orbit interaction in uge@xmath6 results in an abnormal huge magnetocrystalline anisotropy @xcite .",
    "monthoux et al.@xcite indicates that the favorite superconducting pairing type of this anisotropy is triplet .",
    "although the exact symmetry of the paired state has not yet been identified , a spin - triplet pairing is more likely than the spin - singlet pairing in these superconductors @xcite .",
    "these behaviors are somewhat like charged spin-1 bosons .",
    "thus the charged spin-1 boson model helps to understand the exotic magnetic properties observed in such materials .",
    "although the ferromagnetism @xcite in a chargeless spinor bose gas has also been involved in theory , it is little discussed when fm interaction exists in a charged spin system .",
