    "a quite remarkable experimental achievement of the last decade is the direct observation of chemical dissociation at the single - molecule level by applying time - dependent external forces on the pico - newton scale .",
    "this technique is called dynamic force spectroscopy or single - molecule force spectroscopy and reviewed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "it allows to extract kinetic constants and energy landscape parameters of various interactions like antibody - antigen recognition @xcite or protein - dna interactions @xcite .",
    "also the dynamics of various other experimental systems are governed by thermally activated transitions out of a metastable state over a potential barrier , whose height decreases in time due to a steadily increasing external force .",
    "examples include the polarization reversal in nanomagnets @xcite , friction at the atomic scale @xcite , and phase jumps in josephson junctions @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "the knowledge of the force - dependent rate out of the metastable state can be exploited to characterize the system studied .",
    "the main theme of the present work is how to perform such a characterization in the most optimal way and to point out the limitations even of such an optimized procedure under practical conditions .",
    "a typical experimental setup is schematically sketched in fig .",
    "1 : the single chemical bond of interest , e.g. in a ligand - receptor complex , is connected via two linker molecules with the tip of an afm ( atomic force microscope ) cantilever ( or some other micromechanical tool ) and a piezoelectric element . the latter is employed for `` pulling down '' the attached linker molecule at some constant velocity , leading to an elastic reaction force of the cantilever , determined from the deflection of a laser beam . the main quantity of interest is the magnitude of the force at the moment when the bond breaks .        the theoretical interpretation of the observed rupture forces is a non - trivial task for the following reasons . upon repeating the same experiment with the same pulling velocity ,",
    "the rupture forces are found to be distributed over a wide range , contrary to what one would naively expect for a purely mechanical breaking of a compound object at some fixed , `` critical '' strain force .",
    "a further theoretical challenge represents the experimental finding that for different pulling velocities different such distributions are obtained .",
    "hence , neither a single rupture event nor the average rupture force at any fixed pulling velocity can serve as a meaningful characteristics of a given chemical bond strength .",
    "major steps in solving the puzzle are due to bell @xcite and to evans and ritchie @xcite , recognizing that a forced bond rupture event is a thermally activated decay of a metastable state that can be described within the general framework of kramers reaction rate theory @xcite .",
    "subsequently , their basic theoretical approach has been extended and refined in several important directions , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "following evans and ritchie @xcite , a single - molecule dissociation process is viewed as thermally activated escape of a reaction coordinate @xmath0 over a potential barrier , see fig .",
    "2 . given the one - dimensional potential landscape along the reaction",
    "coordinate , the dissociation rate @xmath1 for an instantaneous force @xmath2 ( projected onto the direction of the reaction coordinate ) can be written according to kramers reaction - rate theory @xcite in the form @xmath3 where the pre - exponential factor @xmath4 has the intuitive meaning of an `` attempt frequency '' and the exponentially leading boltzmann - arrhenius factor contains the relevant potential barrier @xmath5 against escape , boltzmann s constant @xmath6 , and the temperature @xmath7 .     of a receptor - ligand - bond as function of the reaction",
    "coordinate @xmath0 without and with externally applied bias forces @xmath8 . for low forces the main effect",
    "is that the energy barrier @xmath9 is lowered by an amount @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the distance between potential well and barrier at zero force . for larger forces",
    "this distance decreases . ]    in dynamic force spectroscopy experiments , the rate at which the force increases is much slower than all other relevant molecular relaxation processes . due to",
    "this separation of time scales @xcite , the reaction kinetics can be very accurately approximated by the following first - order differential equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the survival probability of the bond up to time @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the accompanying dissociation rate ( [ 1.20 ] ) at an instantaneous external force @xmath16 .    ideally , one would wish to use the experimentally established force - dependent escape rate @xmath1 to reconstruct the potential landscape , i.e. potential energy vs. the reaction coordinate , cf .",
    "however , in view of the fact that the escape rate depends on the energy _ difference _ at two force - dependent extrema , this problem does not have a unique solution @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may start with some model energy landscape , and try to deduce its global features , such as barrier height in the absence of the force and dissociation length ( the distance between potential well and barrier without bias force , cf . fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this introduces some specific functional form for the escape rate ( [ 1.20 ] ) involving several parameters , which are then determined by fitting the experimental data . in the present work",
    ", we describe the application of the maximum likelihood approach @xcite as a tool to deduce the model parameters .",
    "we show that this method is superior to any other approach that may be used for this purpose .    after introducing the method",
    ", we discuss its application to determine the parameters of a commonly used ansatz for the rate due to bell , henceforth called bell s model @xcite .",
    "this approximation assumes that the force is sufficiently small , so that the force - dependent barrier height decreases linearly with the force , the proportionality constant @xmath11 being the dissociation length ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , @xmath17 the two fit parameters used in this approach are the escape rate at zero force , @xmath18 , and the dissociation length , @xmath11 . within bell s model , it is impossible to uncouple the intrinsic time and energy scales of the system , because multiplication of @xmath19 by an arbitrary constant and addition of @xmath20 times the logarithm of that constant to @xmath21 leaves the force - free rate value , @xmath22 , and hence the statistics of escape events , the same .",
    "one of the central problems of the present work is gaining more information about the system than bell s model allows .",
    "obviously , in order to make it possible , one needs to use a functional form of the escape rate @xmath1 involving more fit parameters than in bell s ansatz .",
    "indeed , it has been suggested @xcite that one can actually estimate the value of the force - free activation barrier @xmath21 if one makes a more realistic assumption about how the barrier decreases from this value with increasing force ; the linear decrease ( [ 1.30 ] ) is replaced with a non - linear potential .",
    "then , the force - dependent rate involves more than two fit parameters , the force - free barrier height @xmath21 being one of them .",
    "it is intuitively clear that the more rate parameters one has , the better one can characterize the system of interest . on the other hand ,",
    "if the number of fit parameters is too large , then not all of them may be determined sufficiently accurately from the experimental data .",
    "therefore , a relevant question is : what is the maximal number of rate parameters , which one can establish reliably ? for a quite common and general parametrization of the potential we show that the highest number of model parameters one can determine from fitting the experimental data is three , while inclusion of additional parameters into the theory does not improve the quality of the fit .",
    "these three parameters are related to the force - free escape rate , the height of the activation barrier , and the dissociation length .",
    "furthermore , we show that the resulting fit values of these parameters strongly depend on the assumption concerning the manner in which the activation barrier decreases with the applied force . in other words",
    ", one can not determine them uniquely without having this information .",
    "for a quantitative analysis of dynamic force spectroscopy experiments one usually assumes that the force @xmath16 increases linearly , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the ( constant ) pulling velocity , and @xmath25 the relevant total elasticity of cantilever , linker molecules , receptor and ligand , cf .",
    "1 . using the fact that the extension @xmath26 of the complex at time @xmath14 is @xmath27 we see that ( [ 2.10 ] ) is equivalent to the assumption of a linear force - extension characteristics .    combining eqs .",
    "( [ 1.10 ] ) and ( [ 2.10 ] ) , we arrive at the central experimental quantity , namely the probability density of escape events at the force value @xmath2 for a given velocity @xmath24 and a given set of parameters @xmath28 characterizing the escape rate @xmath1 : @xmath29 for later convenience , the rupture force distribution ( [ 2.20 ] ) is written as a conditional probability , conditioned on the values of the model parameters @xmath28 and the pulling velocity @xmath24 . while , in practice , the latter is directly accessible from the measurement , the model parameters @xmath28 have to be inferred from the distribution of rupture forces .",
    "it is possible to evaluate the integral ( [ 2.21 ] ) numerically for any functional form of the rate @xmath1 .",
    "however , the exponentially increasing character of this function , see eq .",
    "( [ 1.20 ] ) , allows one to derive a very efficient analytical approximation for the integral .",
    "namely , in view of eq .",
    "( [ 1.20 ] ) , the main contribution to the integral @xmath30 comes from the @xmath31-region just below @xmath2 .",
    "this allows one to expand @xmath32 in the vicinity of the upper limit of integration @xmath2 to the first order @xcite : @xmath33 with this approximation , the integral in ( [ 2.21 ] ) is given by @xmath34 this simple approximate formula may be sufficient for most practical purposes .",
    "however , if the deviations of @xmath32 from linearity are important , one can use the second - order approximation for this function near @xmath35 : @xmath36 allowing one to evaluate the rate integral in ( [ 2.21 ] ) as @xmath37}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2\\lambda_2(f)}}\\\\ & & \\bigg[{\\mathrm{erf}}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda_2(f)}{2 } } \\left(f + \\frac{\\lambda_1(f)}{\\lambda_2(f)}\\right)\\right ) -{\\mathrm{erf}}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_1(f)}{\\sqrt{2\\lambda_2(f)}}\\right)\\bigg]\\ ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the error function .",
    "additional numerical analysis has shown that the inaccuracy of this expression is smaller than 1% for all reasonable functional choices @xmath1 which we have checked .",
    "let us assume that a specific model and thus the particular form of the probability density @xmath39 in ( [ 2.20 ] ) can be considered as given .",
    "then the remaining task is to estimate the model parameters @xmath28 from a given set of @xmath40 rupture forces @xmath41 and pulling velocities @xmath42 .",
    "there exist different `` recipes '' for doing this , called estimators .",
    "each of them can be formally represented by some function @xmath43 , indicating that the estimate , being a function of the random variables @xmath44 , is a random variable itself .",
    "now , the main question is : what is the optimal estimate of the model parameters that can be extracted from the given set of @xmath40 rupture forces ? stated differently : which recipe yields estimates @xmath43 of the model parameters which are _ on average _ over many data sets @xmath44 closest to the _ `` true '' model parameters _ ?    in this section we discuss some properties of estimators and show that under realistic experimental conditions , given in single - molecule pulling experiments , no estimator @xmath43 outperforms the maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "the reader who is not interested in the mathematical details may skip the subsequent subsections a - c and immediately proceed to subsection d , where we summarize the main steps which are necessary for a practical application .      our starting point is the probability @xmath45 to observe a given set of @xmath40 rupture forces @xmath41 measured at pulling velocities @xmath46 .",
    "since the @xmath47 are statistically independent , this probability reads : @xmath48 the proceeding consists in simply maximizing ( [ 3.10 ] ) with respect to @xmath28 @xcite ; usually , this has to be done numerically . for any given @xmath49 and @xmath50 the corresponding set of parameters @xmath51",
    "is called the _ maximum likelihood estimate_.    intuitively , the properties of this estimator are most easily understood within the framework of bayesian inference @xcite . the quantity in ( [ 3.10 ] ) is called _ likelihood _ and plays a central role in the bayesian approach . extending the notion of `` probability '' in the sense of `` degree of belief '' to the model parameters @xmath28 ,",
    "the joint probability @xmath52 can be written in terms of conditional probabilities @xmath53 either in the form @xmath54 or in the form @xmath55 , yielding bayes theorem : @xmath56^{-1 } \\ .",
    "\\label{3.20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the left hand side represents the `` likeliness '' of @xmath28 , given the data @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and hence is clearly of central interest for our purposes .",
    "considering also the right hand side as a function of @xmath28 , it is equal to the likelihood from ( [ 3.10 ] ) times the so called _ prior probability _ @xmath59 , encapsulating all our knowledge about @xmath28 before the measurement , times a @xmath28-independent factor .",
    "thus , determining @xmath60 by means of the right hand side of ( [ 3.20 ] ) provides the central `` recipe of learning '' within the bayesian approach @xcite .",
    "regarding actual practical application of bayesian inference , the determination of the prior probability is the most problematic point .",
    "different recipes for selecting an appropriate prior exist .",
    "common choices are distributions which are uniform in the parameters or the logarithms of the parameters .",
    "rigorous justifications are in general not possible and one is left with postulating some heuristic ad hoc ansatz",
    ".    however , dynamic force spectroscopy usually provides large data sets , i.e. large @xmath40 .",
    "then the likelihood ( [ 3.10 ] ) develops a narrow peak in the region of its maximum @xmath61 ( see next section ) and the prior @xmath62 in ( [ 3.20 ] ) , though usually unknown in detail , can be considered as approximately constant , i.e. latexmath:[$p({{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\mu$ } } }    given @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the likelihood ( [ 3.10 ] ) thus quantifies the `` likeliness '' that the `` true '' model parameters are @xmath28 .",
    "the upshot of the above intuitive considerations is that maximizing ( [ 3.10 ] ) with respect to @xmath28 should yield the best possible guess for the unknown true parameters .",
    "furthermore , the statistical uncertainties of this estimate should be somehow related to the width of the likelihood . in the following subsection",
    ", we leave this intuitive level and turn to a more rigorous discussion of the asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "let us assume that the rupture forces @xmath47 have been sampled according to the `` true '' distribution @xmath64 with unknown , _ `` true '' model parameters _ @xmath65 .",
    "for a given set of rupture forces @xmath49 and pulling velocities @xmath50 the maximum likelihood estimate can then be determined as described above . upon repeating the entire set of @xmath40 pulling experiments with the same set of pulling velocities @xmath58 , a different set of rupture data @xmath66",
    "will be sampled , yielding a different maximum likelihood estimate @xmath61 . while the probability distribution of @xmath57 is given by ( [ 3.10 ] ) with @xmath67 ,",
    "what can we say about the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimates @xmath61 ?    to answer this question we first exploit the fact that in typical single - molecule pulling experiments for each pulling velocity several hundred rupture forces are measured .",
    "the resulting set of rupture force data @xmath49 is thus quite large and it is convenient to rewrite the likelihood ( [ 3.10 ] ) as @xmath68 furthermore , we assume that rupture forces have been measured at @xmath69 different pulling velocities @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and that the relative frequency with which the different pulling velocities @xmath24 are sampled , converges towards a well defined limit @xmath72 for @xmath73",
    ". then it follows from the law of large numbers @xcite that @xmath74 for @xmath73 , where @xmath75 indicates an average over @xmath2 and @xmath24 with weight @xmath76 .",
    "hence , @xmath77 is an intensive , entropy - like quantity . observing that @xmath78 is a relative entropy of the form @xmath79 , and using the fact that @xmath80 is normalized with respect to @xmath2 for every choice of the parameters @xmath28",

    "finally , using the inequality @xmath83 we see that @xmath84 and that @xmath85 if the expression in the square brackets on the right hand side of ( [ 3.60 ] ) vanishes for all @xmath2 .",
    "thus , @xmath86 has a _",
    "unique _ absolute minimum at @xmath67 @xcite . since @xmath77 converges for large @xmath40 toward @xmath26 according to ( [ 3.50 ] ) , also the minimum @xmath61 of the former converges to the minimum @xmath65 of the latter , i.e. the maximum likelihood estimate is a so - called consistent estimate @xcite .    for large , but finite @xmath40 values , @xmath28 will be close to @xmath61 .",
    "consequently , we can expand @xmath87 up to second order about its minimum at @xmath61 and neglecting terms of order @xmath88 , the hessian matrix of @xmath89 can be replaced by the hessian @xmath90 of @xmath91 , which is generically positive definite , i.e. @xmath92 for large @xmath40 this is a very good approximation for all @xmath28-values , and @xmath93 approaches a very sharply peaked gaussian about @xmath61 , @xmath94    we can now determine the first moments of the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimate @xmath61 ( upon many repetitions of the same experiment ) . differentiating ( [ 3.80 ] ) and choosing @xmath95 , results in @xmath96 averaging over @xmath57 yields zero in the right hand side , as can be inferred from ( [ 3.40 ] ) , ( [ 3.50 ] ) and the fact that @xmath65 is the minimum of @xmath26 .",

    "equation ( [ 3.110 ] ) thus shows that the maximum likelihood estimate is `` unbiased '' for large @xmath40 .    with ( [ 3.100 ] ) the determination of the second moments",
    "is straightforward .",

    "it should be noted that , in order to derive the above two main conclusions , we did not make any use of the bayesian formalism ( [ 3.20 ] ) at all .",
    "the latter only served to acquire an intuitive idea about the meaning of the likelihood ( [ 3.10 ] ) . at this intuitive level",
    ", we have seen that the left hand side of ( [ 3.20 ] ) is very well approximated by the sharply peaked gaussian in ( [ 3.90 ] ) and hence it is reasonable to expect that its maximum @xmath61 should be the best possible guess for the unknown true parameters @xmath65 that possibly can be inferred from a given set of data @xmath57",
    ". a more rigorous line of reasoning starts with an arbitrary `` recipe ''",
    "@xmath103 of estimating the true parameters @xmath65 from a given data set @xmath57 .",
    "the only assumption is that this recipe is unbiased , i.e. upon repeating the same experiment many times , the `` true '' parameters are recovered on average , @xmath104 . by generalizing the well - known cramr - rao inequality @xcite , which in turn is basically a descendant of the cauchy - schwarz inequality , one can show @xcite for any such `` recipe '' @xmath105 that @xmath106\\ ,   [ \\tilde{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\mu$}}}-{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\mu$}}_0]^\\dagger\\rangle - ( n\\ , h)^{-1 } \\geq 0 \\ , \\label{3.140}\\ ] ] i.e. the matrix in the left hand side is non - negative definite .",
    "comparison with ( [ 3.130 ] ) yields our    _ third main conclusion : _ there is no unbiased estimator @xmath107 of the true parameters @xmath65 which on the average outperforms the maximum likelihood estimate @xmath61 .",
    "the remaining possibility that a biased estimator may be even better is rather subtle to treat rigorously , but intuitively this seems quite unlikely .",
    "furthermore , in the above conclusion we exploited the relation ( [ 3.130 ] ) which is strictly correct only for asymptotically large @xmath40 .",
    "finally , also the criterion of minimizing the left hand side in ( [ 3.140 ] ) itself is in principle debatable , but hardly in practice .",
    "we now briefly summarize the main steps of the maximum likelihood method for evaluating single - molecule pulling experiments .",
    "the first step consists in specifying the dependence of the rupture force probability @xmath108 on the model parameters @xmath28 and the pulling velocity @xmath24 within any given theoretical description .",
    "then for the set of rupture forces @xmath109 and corresponding pulling velocities @xmath110 the logarithm of the likelihood ( [ 3.30 ] ) @xmath111 is maximized with respect to the model parameters @xmath28 .",

[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "when fitting the real experimental data , one does not know a priori the true value of the exponent @xmath174 .",

    "an interesting question arises : are the approximations ( [ 3.130 ] ) and ( [ 4.40])-([4.57 ] ) for the statistical uncertainties of the model parameters still valid for those models , about which we ( in our case ) _ know _ that they are not true ? to study this point , we have repeated the above described procedure for 10000 data sets , each generated in the same way and with same `` true '' parameters as the data set shown in fig .",

    "nevertheless , comparing these distributions to the distribution of the parameters for the `` true '' gamma - value @xmath180 , we see , that by choosing the wrong model , the systematic deviations to the parameters are much larger than the statistical uncertainties . as one will , in general , be unsure about the true underlying energy landscape , and thus about the `` true '' @xmath174-value , this point is essential if one wishes to use the inferred parameter values in another context than the interpretation of single - molecule pulling experiments .",
    "we would like to mention that the deviations between the distributions resulting from the different @xmath174 values increase with the pulling velocity @xcite . hence , by increasing the range of accessible pulling velocities @xmath208 $ ] a clearer distinction between the models is possible .",

    "when fitting the experimental data , one usually adopts some functional form of the force - dependent escape rate involving several fit parameters . by means of a numerical example , we have demonstrated that the largest number of such parameters that can be determined from the experiment is three .",
    "these parameters are related to the force - free value of the rate , the dissociation length , and the barrier height in the absence of the force .",
    "furthermore , when fitting the experimental rupture force distributions , one needs to make an additional assumption about the manner in which the escape rate decreases with the applied force . while the fit values of the force - free escape rate and the dissociation length depend only weakly on this assumption , the value of the force - free barrier height can be determined much less reliably .",
    "we have shown that even if the model adopted for the description of the experiment is not the true one but predicts distributions of rupture forces similar to the measured distribution , the statistical uncertainties found from the maximum likelihood method very well approximate the dispersion of the estimated parameters upon repeating the same experiment many times .",
    "often these uncertainties are much smaller than the systematic error resulting from choosing the `` wrong '' model .",
