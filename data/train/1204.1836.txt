    "in the study of the open dynamics of a multipartite quantum system it is frequently made the simplifying assumption that each subsystem interacts with its own local environment . in the language of quantum communication",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the resulting time evolution is memoryless i.e. that the noise tampering the communication acts independently on each local component ( information carrier ) of the transmitted quantum message . in recent years",
    ", however , it has been shown that interesting new features emerge when one makes the realistic assumption that the action of a channel over consecutive uses is correlated  @xcite .",
    "such correlations have been phenomenologically described in terms of a markov chain which gives the joint probability distribution of the local kraus operators acting on the individual carriers  @xcite .",
    "alternatively they have been effectively represented in terms of local interactions of the carriers with a common multipartite environment which is originally prepared into a correlated ( possibly entangled ) initial state  @xcite , or with a structured environment composed by local and global components  @xcite .",
    "these models , although physically well motivated do not have an intrinsic time structure , in other words they are unable to describe a situation in which the information carriers interact one after the other with an environment which in the meanwhile evolves . for instance consider the case in which an ordered sequence of spatially separated photon pulses carrying information in their photon number , propagates at constant speed in a non passive , lossy optical fiber characterized by ( relatively ) slow reaction times .",
    "if the speed of the pulses is sufficiently high , one might expect that , thanks to the mediation of the fiber , excitations from one pulse could be passed to the next one modifying their internal states via a ( partially incoherent ) cascade mechanism ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] a ) for a schematic representation of the process ) .",
    "the net result of course is the creation of delocalized excitations over the whole string of carriers as they proceed along the fiber ( the extent of such delocalization depending upon the ratio between the transmission rate at which the carriers are fed into the fiber and the dissipation rate of the latter ) .",
    "alternatively , consider the case in which a linear array of local quantum systems ( say a set of driven qed cavities as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] b ) , or a set of quantum dots composing a quantum cascade laser  @xcite ) , are indirectly coupled via unidirectional environmental mediators ( the photons emitted by the cavities or by the dots ) which passing from one system to the other , allow them to exchange excitations  @xcite .",
    "as in the previous case , the formation of delocalized excitations is expected as time passes ( in this case the delocalization of the excitation will depend upon the product between the damping rate of the mediator and the distance between two consecutive quantum systems ) .    the general form for master equations which describe these situations has been recently derived in ref .",
    "@xcite by adopting a collisional approach  @xcite to describe the system / environment coupling .",

    "if the propagation speed of the pulses is sufficiently high , the excitations they waste in a given sector of the fiber can not be re - absorbed by the same pulse : still the subsequent pulses have a certain probability of absorbing it .",

    "@xcite , the carriers / sub - enviroment couplings are described via a sequence of pairwise , time - ordered unitary interactions which in our case are organized as in the scheme shown in  fig .",

    "it is worth stressing that in writing eq .",
    "( [ hh2 ] ) one implicitly assumes that a given carrier never interact twice with the _ same _ sub - enviroment .",

    "its validity relies on the existence of a two well separated time scales : a fast one , which defines the typical correlation times of the environment , and a slow one , which instead defines the dissipative effects on the system of interest ( i.e. the carriers ) induced by the coupling with the bath .",
    "such assumption of course is not always fulfilled and when enforced it inhibits the possibility of feedback mechanisms where the state of the system at a given time is influenced by the entire evolution history .",
    "notice however that in the scenario we are considering here , the global markovian structure of the coupling  ( [ hh2 ] ) does nt prevent the possibility that different carriers could have a non trivial causal influence on each other .",
    "in other words , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] a ) , quantum  information \" can be transferred from one carrier to the other through the intermediation of the environment .    in top of the processes described by the unitary couplings  ( [ hh2 ] ) we also assume that between two consecutive collisions each sub - environment evolves according to the action of a local completely positive ( cp ) map @xmath6 .",
    "the latter is introduced to effectively account for the internal dynamics of @xmath11 : in particular the transformations @xmath6 mimics the relaxation processes that may take place within the environment alone ( e.g. originating from the mutual interactions between its various parts ) and which in principle involve timescales different from those that define the _ rate _ of the collisional events . in other words , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mappings @xmath32 act as  dampers \" for the information that percolates from one carrier to the subsequent one change passing from one collisional event to the other being straightforward . ] : how effective such damping is , it depends of course upon the rate at which two subsequent carriers approach the same sub - environemnt ( i.e. in the example of fig .",

    "the transformation @xmath48 describes the evolution of @xmath14 in its interaction with @xmath11 plus the subsequent free evolution of the latter induced by the maps  @xmath49 .",
    "alternatively , exploiting the fact that for @xmath50 , @xmath51 the operators @xmath52 and @xmath53 commute , @xmath37 can also be expressed in terms of _ column _ super - operators concatenated in series as follows : @xmath54 where for all @xmath55 , @xmath56 equations  ( [ row ] ) and ( [ column ] ) enlighten the causal structure of the model .",

    "such model describes damping or amplification for the cavity field , whose dynamics can be described by a markovian master equation in lindblad form @xmath107 . the extension to @xmath33 cavity",
    "is described naturally in our model .",
    "such markovian behavior is due to two crucial features of the model : the short ( finite ) time @xmath27 which takes each atom to cross a cavity and the fact that the atomic state is  refreshed \" when a new atom is injected .",
    "the master equation so obtained describes a coarse grained time derivative on a timescale @xmath27 . on such time scale",
    "the environment is reset . in the standard theory of damping of a system which is continuosly interacting with the same - big - reservoir the time @xmath27 would be the self correlation time of the reservoir",
    "this is not the case in our scenario : each sub environment is small but it interacts for a short time and then , after a time @xmath27 substituted with a new one .",
    "furthermore the cross terms in our master equation do not describe a collective , simultaneous , coupling of the subsystems with the environment , but rather they describe how the dynamics of the various subsystems are correlated due to the fact that they have interacted sequentially with the sub environments .",
    "this explains why the dynamics described by our system is markovian and does not exhibit the non markovian multipartite features which are characteristic of the scenarios analyzed in @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ eqperr11245 ] ) can be turned into a continuos time expression by taking the proper limit @xmath108 while sending @xmath33 to infinity so that @xmath109 notice that there are two possible regimes . if @xmath28 is kept constant as @xmath27 goes to zero , then the dissipative contributions of eq .",
    "( [ eqperr11245 ] ) are washed away and the dynamics reduces to a unitary evolution characterized by the effective ( possibly time - dependent ) hamiltonian  ( [ hefficace ] ) .",
    "the situation becomes more interesting if instead @xmath28 is sent to infinity so that @xmath110 remains finite , i.e.  @xcite @xmath111 enforcing this limit is of course problematic due to the presence of the first order contribution in eq .",

    "here we only mention that the cross terms appearing in eq .",
    "( [ fin ] ) have an intrinsic unidirectional character which makes this expression suitable to characterize the dynamics of a cascade quantum system .",
    "indeed , for each @xmath99 it can be directly verified from eq .",

    "the opposite relation however is not true as in general @xmath116 does nt nullify when traced over @xmath117 , i.e. @xmath118 .",
