    "<S> the contribution to @xmath41 from higher than @xmath42 is negligible since the strange quark distribution is much suppressed in the region . the unusual persistence of the quark threshold at large @xmath0 originates in the @xmath43 singularity of eq . </S>",

    "<S> again we can see the importance of charm content at very small @xmath0 , which should be closely examined at future super colliders and deep inelastic experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> we have seen that due to the quark threshold effect the ratio of heavy quark to light quark sea components should vary considerably with feynman  @xmath0 . in a recent phenomenological data </S>",
    "<S> fit the cteq collaboration  @xcite has observed this behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this variation is in distinct contrast to previous works where @xmath49 has been assumed .    although we do not know the precise definition of the mass of the partons inside the nucleon , we assume that mass differences among quarks provide the only dynamical mechanism generating the differences of sea distribution among quarks . </S>",
    "<S> we then can qualitatively reproduce the cetq results . </S>",
    "<S> there still exist many theoretically and experimentally unresolved problems related to the understanding of the proton s structure , and we urge particle physicists to consider seriously this problem of flavor dependence of sea distribution inside the proton . </S>"
