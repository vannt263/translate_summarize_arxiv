    "at least since the work of j.  l.  cardy in  1986 , the importance of the role of the modular group has been emphasized in conformal field theory , and it has been extensively investigated since then .",
    "this importance stems from the fact that the characters of the primary fields , which depend on a complex parameter , are equivariant with respect to the action of the modular group on the upper half plane on the one hand and a linear representation of the modular group on the other hand , which is finite - dimensional in the case of a rational conformal field theory .",
    "it was soon noticed in the course of this development that under quite general assumptions a frequently used generator of the modular group has finite order in this representation .",
    "since this generator and one of its conjugates together generate the modular group , this leads naturally to the conjecture that the kernel of the before - mentioned representation is a congruence subgroup .",
    "after an intense investigation , this conjecture was finally established by p.  bantay .    in a different line of thought ,",
    "y.  kashina observed , while investigating whether the antipode of a finite - dimensional yetter - drinfeld hopf algebra over a semisimple hopf algebra has finite order , that certain generalized powers associated with the semisimple hopf algebra tend to become trivial after a certain number of steps .",
    "she established this fact in several cases and conjectured that in general this finite number after which the generalized powers become trivial , which is now called the exponent of the hopf algebra , divides the dimension of the hopf algebra .",
    "this conjecture is presently still open .",
    "however , p.  etingof and s.  gelaki , realizing the connection between these two lines of thought , were able to establish the finiteness of the exponent and showed that it divides at least the third power of the dimension .",
    "they also explained the connection of the exponent to the order of the generator of the modular group by showing that the exponent of the hopf algebra is equal to the order of the drinfeld element of the drinfeld double of the hopf algebra . in this context , it should be noted that this connection between hopf algebras and conformal field theory has been intensively investigated by many authors ; we only mention here the modular hopf algebras and modular categories of n.  reshetikhin and v.  g.  turaev on the one hand and the modular transformations considered by v.  lyubashenko and his coauthors on the other hand .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to unite these two lines of thought further by establishing an analogue of bantay s results for semisimple hopf algebras .",
    "we will show in theorem  [ congdrinfdoubl ] that the kernel of the action of the modular group on the center of the drinfeld double of a semisimple hopf algebra is a congruence subgroup of level  @xmath0 , where  @xmath0 is the exponent of the hopf algebra discussed above .",
    "the proof of this theorem becomes possible by the use of a new tool , a further generalization of the higher frobenius - schur indicators studied earlier by y.  kashina and the authors .",
    "these new indicators , which we call equivariant frobenius - schur indicators , are functions on the center of the drinfeld double and carry an action of the modular group that is equivariant with respect to the action of the modular group on the center .",
    "this equivariance in particular connects , via the action of the verlinde matrix that arises from the other frequently used generator of the modular group , the first formula for the higher frobenius - schur indicators with the second resp .",
    "third formula , whose interplay is crucial for the proof of cauchy s theorem for hopf algebras .",
    "the drinfeld double is an example of a factorizable hopf algebra , and the results for the drinfeld double can be partially generalized to this more general class .",
    "however , in the case of a factorizable semisimple hopf algebra , the modular group acts in general only projectively on the center of the hopf algebra .",
    "this phenomenon also occurs in conformal field theory , and also in the general framework of modular categories , of which the representation category of a semisimple factorizable hopf algebra is an example .",
    "but it is still possible to talk about the kernel of the projective representation , i.e. , the subgroup of the modular group that acts as the identity on the associated projective space of the center .",
    "we will also show , in paragraph  [ projcong ] , that in this more general case this so - called projective kernel is a congruence subgroup of level  @xmath0 .    however , if the drinfeld element of the factorizable hopf algebra has the same trace as its inverse in the regular representation , then the projective representation just discussed is in fact an ordinary linear representation .",
    "this happens in particular in the case of a drinfeld double , where both of these traces are equal to the dimension of the doubled hopf algebra .",
    "if these traces coincide , it is therefore meaningful to talk about the kernel of the linear representation , and we show in theorem  [ hopfsymbcong ] that this kernel is also a congruence subgroup of level  @xmath0 .    the article is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : modgroup ] , after briefly recalling some facts about the modular group , we describe a relation that characterizes the orbits of the principal congruence subgroups and plays an important role in the proof of the orbit theorem in paragraph  [ orbitthm ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "quasitrihopf ] , we recall some basic facts about quasitriangular hopf algebras and the drinfeld double construction , and prove some lemmas about the drinfeld element and the evaluation form . in section  [ sec : factorizehopf ] , we prove some facts about factorizable hopf algebras that are important for the equivariance properties that we will discuss later . in section  [ sec : actmodgroup ] , we construct the action of the modular group on the center of a factorizable hopf algebra .",
    "it must be emphasized that this construction is not new ; on the contrary , it is discussed in abundance in the literature we have already quoted , especially in v.  g.  turaev s monograph on the one hand and in two closely related articles v.  lyubashenko on the other hand .",
    "what we do in this section is to translate lyubashenko s graphical proof of the modular identities into the language of quasitriangular hopf algebras , thereby offering a presentation of these results that is not yet available in the literature in this form .    in section  [ sec : faktsemisim ]",
    ", we specialize to the semisimple case .",
    "we can then use the centrally primitive idempotents as a basis and therefore get explicit matrices for the action of the modular group constructed in section  [ sec : actmodgroup ] . in the case of a drinfeld double ,",
    "there is a different construction for the action of the modular group based on the evaluation form and using a slightly less frequently used set of generators of the modular group .",
    "this description of the action , which is crucial for the proof of the equivariance theorem in paragraph  [ equivarthm ] , is given in section  [ sec : casedrinfdoub ] .",
    "for two modules  @xmath1 and  @xmath2 of a semisimple hopf algebra  @xmath3 , the modules @xmath4 and  @xmath5 are in general not isomorphic .",
    "however , as we show in section  [ sec : indmod ] , the corresponding induced modules of the drinfeld double  @xmath6 are isomorphic .",
    "the constructed isomorphism is the essential element for the definition of the equivariant frobenius - schur indicators  @xmath7 in section  [ sec : equifrobschur ] , which depend on an @xmath3-module  @xmath1 , two integers  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 , and a central element  @xmath10 in the drinfeld double  @xmath6 .",
    "we then prove the equivariance theorem @xmath11 for an element  @xmath12 of the modular group . in paragraph",
    "[ orbitthm ] , we prove the orbit theorem , which asserts that the equivariant indicators only depend on the orbit of  @xmath13 under the principal congruence subgroup determined by the exponent .",
    "this is applied in section  [ sec : congsubgrthm ] to prove the congruence subgroup theorem , which asserts that  @xmath14 for all  @xmath10 in the center of the drinfeld double  @xmath6 and all  @xmath12 in the principal congruence subgroup .",
    "note that the orbit theorem is an immediate consequence of the equivariance theorem and the congruence subgroup theorem . finally , in the case of an arbitrary factorizable hopf algebra , we prove the projective congruence subgroup theorem , which asserts that the kernel of the projective representation is a congruence subgroup .",
    "the wedderburn components of the character ring of a semisimple factorizable hopf algebra are isomorphic to subfields of the cyclotomic field determined by the exponent . as in conformal field theory",
    ", we therefore get an action of the galois group of the cyclotomic field on the character ring . as we explain in section  [ sec : galoisgroup ] , this linear action of the galois group arises naturally as the composition of the two semilinear actions that preserve the characters resp .",
    "the primitive idempotents of the character ring . in section  [ sec : galind ] , we relate these actions of the galois group to the equivariant frobenius - schur indicators , which enables us to show in theorem  [ galmod ] that in the case of a drinfeld double the action of the galois group coincides with the action of the diagonal matrices in the reduced modular group  @xmath15 .",
    "this is again confirming the parallels with conformal field theory , where the analogous result was known in many cases .",
    "however , this theorem does not hold for a general semisimple factorizable hopf algebra , as we see in section  [ sec : galcong ] : under the assumption that the character of the regular representation takes the same value on the drinfeld element and on its inverse , which happens for drinfeld doubles , the action of the modular group , which is in general only projective , becomes an ordinary linear representation .",
    "generalizing the congruence subgroup theorem from paragraph  [ congdrinfdoubl ] , we show in theorem  [ hopfsymbcong ] that the kernel of this linear representation is again a congruence subgroup of level  @xmath0 , so that we again get an action of the reduced modular group  @xmath15 . but this time the action of the galois group may differ from the action of the diagonal matrices by a certain dirichlet character , which , as it generalizes the jacobi symbol to hopf algebras , we call the hopf symbol .    throughout the whole exposition , we consider an algebraically closed base field that is denoted by  @xmath16 . from section  [ sec : faktsemisim ] on until the end , we assume in addition that  @xmath16 has characteristic zero . all vector spaces considered are defined over  @xmath16 , and all tensor products without subscripts are taken over  @xmath16 .",

    "the greatest common divisor of two integers  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 is denoted by  @xmath28 and is always chosen to be nonnegative .",
    "furthermore , @xmath3 denotes a hopf algebra of finite dimension  @xmath29 with coproduct  @xmath30 , counit  @xmath31 , and antipode  @xmath32 .",
    "we will use the same symbols to denote the corresponding structure elements of the dual hopf algebra  @xmath33 , except for the antipode , which is denoted by  @xmath34 .",

    "[ [ genrel ] ]    in this article , the modular group is defined as the group @xmath42 of @xmath43-matrices with integer entries and determinant  @xmath21 ; note that many authors define it as the quotient group @xmath44 instead .",
    "the modular group is generated by the two matrices @xmath45 it is easy to see that these matrices satisfy the relations @xmath46 however , it is a nontrivial result that these are defining relations for the modular group .",
    "it is possible to replace the generator  @xmath47 by the generator @xmath48 the generators  @xmath49 and  @xmath50 satisfy the relations @xmath51 and it follows from the corresponding result for the preceding generators that this also constitutes a presentation of the modular group in terms of generators and relations . from this",
    ", we get that @xmath52 , which means that @xmath53 , so that the generators  @xmath49 and  @xmath50 are conjugate .",
    "the matrix @xmath54 is not contained in @xmath55 , but conjugation by  @xmath56 induces an automorphism of  @xmath55 , for which we introduce the following notation :    for @xmath57 , we define  @xmath58 .    note that we have @xmath59 so that @xmath60 whenever  @xmath61 . in particular , we find for the special matrices that we have used above as generators that @xmath62    [ [ congsubgr ] ]    if @xmath0 is a natural number , the quotient map from  @xmath63 to @xmath64 induces a group homomorphism @xmath65 by applying the quotient map to every component of the matrix .",
    "the kernel of this map is denoted by  @xmath66 and called the principal congruence subgroup of level  @xmath0 . in other words",
    ", we have @xmath67 in particular , we have  @xmath68 .",
    "a subgroup of the modular group is called a congruence subgroup if it contains  @xmath66 for a suitable  @xmath0 , and the smallest such  @xmath0 is called the level of the congruence subgroup .    the modular group acts naturally on the lattice  @xmath69 .",
    "the orbits of the principal congruence subgroups can be described as follows :    two nonzero lattice points @xmath70 are in the same @xmath66-orbit if and only if @xmath71 and @xmath72    if @xmath13 and @xmath73 are in the same @xmath66-orbit , so that @xmath74 then we have for the ideals of  @xmath63 generated by @xmath75 resp .",
    "@xmath76 that @xmath77 and vice versa , so that the first assertion holds .",
    "if we divide the above relation by  @xmath78 , we see that @xmath79 and @xmath80 are still in the same @xmath66-orbit , and if we reduce this relation modulo  @xmath0 , we see that they are componentwise congruent .    for the converse",

    "now as @xmath8 and @xmath9 are relatively prime , we can find integers @xmath29 and  @xmath84 satisfying @xmath85 , so that @xmath86 in other words , @xmath13 and @xmath87 are in the same @xmath55-orbit , so that we can in fact assume @xmath88 .",
    "this means that we only have to show that a pair  @xmath73 of relatively prime integers of the form @xmath89 is in the same @xmath66-orbit as  @xmath87 . but",
    "this means that we have to find integers @xmath90",

    "furthermore , it should be noted that in the case @xmath100 it yields the following fact :    two nonzero lattice points @xmath70 are in the same @xmath55-orbit if and only if @xmath101 .",
    "[ [ orbcongrel ] ]    the group homomorphism from  @xmath102 to  @xmath15 discussed at the beginning of paragraph  [ congsubgr ] is surjective . the proof of this fact uses the following lemma , which we will use below for a different purpose :    suppose that @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and  @xmath0 are relatively prime integers and that @xmath103 .",
    "then there exists an integer  @xmath104 such that @xmath105 is relatively prime to  @xmath9 .",
    "we need to introduce another subgroup of the modular group .",
    "we denote by  @xmath106 the subgroup of  @xmath55 that is generated by all conjugates  @xmath107 of  @xmath108 for  @xmath57 .",
    "this subgroup is obviously normal , and it follows from the discussion in paragraph  [ genrel ] that it contains  @xmath109 . since @xmath66 is a normal subgroup that contains  @xmath108 , we have that  @xmath106 is contained in  @xmath66 .",
    "however , @xmath106 is strictly smaller than  @xmath66 if  @xmath110 , and it is not even a congruence subgroup in this case . to deal with this difficulty ,",
    "we adapt the following notion from the theory of monoids to our situation :    an equivalence relation on the lattice  @xmath111 is called a congruence relation if , for all @xmath57 , the lattice points  @xmath112 and @xmath113 are equivalent whenever the lattice points  @xmath13 and  @xmath114 are equivalent .    from every normal subgroup of the modular group , we get a congruence relation by defining that two lattice points are equivalent if they are in the same orbit under the action of the normal subgroup . in this way , both  @xmath66 and  @xmath106 give rise to congruence relations .    considering relations as sets of pairs",
    ", one can show as in the case of monoids that the intersection of congruence relations is again a congruence relation .",
    "therefore , for every relation there is a smallest congruence relation that contains this relation , namely the intersection of all congruence relations that contain the given relation . in this sense",
    ", we now consider the smallest congruence relation  @xmath115 on the lattice  @xmath111 that has the following two properties :    1 .",
    "we have @xmath116 .",
    "2 .   we have @xmath117 for every @xmath104 that satisfies @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the second property appears to be asymmetrical with respect to the two components .",
    "this is , however , not the case , because if  @xmath84 satisfies @xmath118 and @xmath120 , we have @xmath121 so that @xmath122",
    ".    we will need another property of the congruence relation  @xmath115 :    for every integer  @xmath123 , we have @xmath124 whenever @xmath125 .",
    "this is obvious if @xmath126 , so let us assume that @xmath127 .",
    "suppose that  @xmath128 is an arbitrary congruence relation that satisfies the two defining properties of  @xmath115 , i.e. , that satisfies @xmath129 and @xmath130 for every @xmath104 with the properties @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "recall that  @xmath115 is the intersection of all such congruence relations .",
    "we define a new relation  @xmath131 by setting @xmath132 it is immediate that this is again a congruence relation .",
    "it also satisfies the first defining property , namely that @xmath133 . for the second property , note that if @xmath104 satisfies @xmath118 and @xmath119 , it also satisfies @xmath134 , so that @xmath135 and therefore  @xmath136 .",
    "this shows that @xmath125 implies @xmath137 , which means that @xmath138 . as this holds for all such congruence relations  @xmath128 , we get @xmath124 , as asserted . @xmath96    it is not hard to see that , if we had dropped the second defining property above , the congruence relation that would have arisen would have been exactly the one determined by the group  @xmath106 as described above .",
    "the following theorem asserts that , by incorporating the second property , we get exactly the congruence relation determined by the group  @xmath66 :    two lattice points  @xmath13 and  @xmath73 are in the same @xmath66-orbit if and only if @xmath125 .    ( )    let us first show that equivalent lattice points are in the same @xmath66-orbit . for this , we need to look at the two defining properties of our congruence relation . for the first property ,",
    "it is obvious that  @xmath13 and  @xmath139 are in the same @xmath66-orbit .",
    "for the second property , suppose that @xmath104 satisfies @xmath118 and @xmath140 .",
    "if @xmath13 is nonzero , we have that  @xmath79 and  @xmath141 are componentwise congruent modulo  @xmath0 . by proposition  [ congsubgr",

    "clearly , this is also the case if  @xmath143 .",
    "this shows that the congruence relation determined by  @xmath66 , for which the equivalence classes are exactly the @xmath66-orbits , takes part in the intersection that was used to define the relation  @xmath115 . in other words , if @xmath125 , then  @xmath13 and  @xmath73 are in the same @xmath66-orbit .",
    "now suppose that  @xmath13 and  @xmath73 are in the same @xmath66-orbit . in the case @xmath100 , we have @xmath144 , and we have already pointed out above that the two lattice points are then equivalent .",

    "we need a couple of reductions .",
    "the first reduction is that we can assume in addition that all the components  @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath94 , and  @xmath95 are also relatively prime to  @xmath0 . to see this , choose two distinct primes  @xmath146 and  @xmath147 that do not divide  @xmath0 . by corollary  [ congsubgr ]",

    "but if we could establish that @xmath150 and  @xmath151 are equivalent , then also  @xmath13 and  @xmath73 would be equivalent , because  @xmath115 is a congruence relation .",

    "this raises the question whether in this case also the kernel of the linear representation is a congruence subgroup of level  @xmath0 . as we will see now ,",
    "this in fact holds .",
    "our reasoning is based on the following lemma , which is an adaption of an argument by a.  coste and t.  gannon to our situation :      it follows from proposition  [ matident ] that @xmath1652 and  @xmath1608 is the unit matrix by construction . if we write this out in components , it means that @xmath1653 if we apply  @xmath1482 to this equation , it becomes @xmath1654 if we replace  @xmath1655 by  @xmath1656 and  @xmath8 by  @xmath1657 , this becomes @xmath1658 but this can by the preceding proposition be written in the form @xmath1659 multiplying  @xmath1660 by this scalar and summing over  @xmath1093 , this becomes @xmath1661 by corollary  [ verlmat ] , and by repeating this argument we get @xmath1662 which gives @xmath1663 after substituting  @xmath1664 for  @xmath8 . applying the antipode , which commutes with  @xmath453 and  @xmath487 , we get @xmath1665 where we have used that @xmath1666 , as observed in paragraph  [ matident ] .",
    "now the assertion follows from corollary  [ invsigma ] .",
    "@xmath96          to begin , recall that we saw in paragraph  [ ribel ] that the condition @xmath1255 , which for the hopf symbol means that @xmath1649 , ensures that the representation of the modular group is linear , and not only projective , so that it is meaningful to talk about the kernel .",
    "recall also our convention from paragraph  [ dualrepmod ] that @xmath1667 in this case .",
    "furthermore , we have just seen in corollary  [ prophopfsymb ] that the hopf symbol is then a dirichlet character and takes only the values  @xmath24 , @xmath21 , and  @xmath1047 .    we have to verify the relations listed in proposition  [ presfac ] .",
    "the relations , @xmath1668 , and @xmath1669 that are listed there first are clearly satisfied .",
    "next , we verify the second relation , i.e. , the relation @xmath200 , where we have factored the exponent in the form @xmath198 for  @xmath8 odd . now , as @xmath1670 , we know from theorem  [ projcong ] that there is a scalar  @xmath1429 such that @xmath1671 for all @xmath334 . inserting @xmath1672 , this becomes @xmath1673 as @xmath566 is an integral , and we have @xmath1674 by corollary  [ verlmat ] , this equation can be rewritten as @xmath1675 which implies @xmath1676 because @xmath1677 , we see that  @xmath1433 is an eigenvalue for  @xmath1678 , and therefore an @xmath8-th root of unity .    similarly , we can insert @xmath1679 into the above equation , which then becomes @xmath1680 applying  @xmath1553 to both sides and dividing by  @xmath1433 , this becomes @xmath1681 therefore  @xmath1682 is an eigenvalue for  @xmath1683 , and therefore a @xmath1684-th root of unity .",
    "but now  @xmath1433 is both a @xmath1684-th root of unity and an @xmath8-th root of unity , which can only be if @xmath1685 , which in turn establishes our relation .",
    "the remaining two relations involve the diagonal matrices  @xmath197 .",
    "now note that with the help of these matrices the formula in the preceding lemma can be expressed as @xmath1686 which shows that @xmath1687 for all @xmath334 .",
    "this means that the relation @xmath1688 listed third in proposition  [ presfac ] reads @xmath1689 but as @xmath1690 , this amounts to the relation @xmath1691 , which was proved in proposition  [ actcent ] .    finally , for the fourth relation in proposition  [ presfac ]",
    ", we have on the one hand that @xmath1692 and on the other hand @xmath1693 both expressions are equal by lemma  [ prophopfsymb ] , so that all the required relations are satisfied .",
    "this proves that  @xmath66 is contained in the kernel , and that the level of the kernel is exactly  @xmath0 follows as in theorem  [ congdrinfdoubl ] .",
    "@xmath96    the preceding theorem generalizes theorem  [ congdrinfdoubl ] , because in the case where @xmath702 is the drinfeld double of a semisimple hopf algebra  @xmath3 , we saw in paragraph  [ roleeval ] that @xmath1694 applying  @xmath1482 to this formula , we see that also @xmath1695 , so that @xmath1696 .",
