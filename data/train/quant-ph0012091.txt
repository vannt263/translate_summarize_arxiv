    "bell s theorem @xcite has made it possible , for the first time , to experimentally demonstrate quantum nonlocality .",
    "later , the ghz experiment @xcite and hardy s @xcite proof without inequalities extended the proof to new domains .",
    "all these proofs , however , involve complete measurements .",
    "this is insufficient since , at the quantum level , measurement can be a continuous process , the intermediate stages of which have seldom been studied .",
    "is it possible to prove that nonlocal effects are produced even by small stages of the measurement process ?",
    "moreover , is it possible to show that nonlocal effects are formed not only by measurement but also by the time - reversed process , namely , quantum erasure ?",
    "affirmative answers would render nonlocality much more intriguing because , in the ordinary epr experiments , a single measurement of a particle disentangles it , and no further measurements can reveal nonlocal effects . once , however , the above two questions are answered in the affirmative , nonlocality will turn out to connect not only discrete events but continuous _ processes _ as well .",
    "the nonlocal influence will then appear to  bounce \" back and forth , many times , between the distant particles during the measurements .",
    "several other intriguing features of qm , such as reversibility and information capacity , would also become manifest .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows .",
    "section i introduces interaction - free measurement .",
    "section ii shows how , when the wave function is appropriately split , interaction - free measurement becomes partial .",
    "section iii shows that such a measurement obeys the uncertainty relations in that it partially disrupts a non - commuting variable .",

    "consider a photon entering a calcite crystal positioned to divert the incident photon according to its polarization along the @xmath0 axis ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "if the photon s polarization is @xmath1 ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , it will be diverted to the lower path , whereas if it is @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) it will be diverted to the upper path .",
    "the calcite thus acts as a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) , similar to the stern - gerlach magnet for spin-@xmath7 particles .",
    "as long as no measurement has been made to find out which path the photon took  thereby leaving the photon s polarization undetermined too  the photon will remain in a superposition of both paths and both polarizations : = c_1+c_2 .",
    "so far , the splitting of the wave function is reversible .",
    "a second calcite , aligned at the @xmath0 plane as the first but facing an opposite direction ( denoted by @xmath8 ) , re - unites the resulting @xmath3 and @xmath6 beams , so that the photon re - emerges in one single beam , in the same state as it has entered the first calcite ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the reversibility of splitting the photon along the @xmath0 direction is demonstrated by the measurement of another , noncommuting variable . before splitting ,",
    "let the photon impinge on a calcite positioned in @xmath9 to the @xmath0 direction , measuring its @xmath10 polarization .",
    "suppose that the @xmath10 polarization has been found to be @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "then , let the photon split according to its @xmath0 polarization and re - unite again ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "if no measurement has been made between the splitting and re - uniting , we are left ignorant about the photon s @xmath0 polarization .",
    "consequently , the @xmath10 polarization will remain intact : a final @xmath10 measurement will _ always _ yield a polarization of @xmath11 , just like the initial @xmath10 measurement .",
    "direction , its polarization along the @xmath10 direction remains intact .",
    "]    suppose , however , that two detectors are placed on the two routes of the split wave function prior to its reunification ( to enable the later reunification of the rays , let the measurements be of the non - demolition type , such that the detectors do not absorb the photon in case of detection ) .",
    "since the @xmath13 state is an even mixture of @xmath6 and @xmath3 , = ( + ) , in 50% of the cases the upper detector will click , and in the other 50% the lower one will .",
    "this measurement has an irreversible consequence : the knowledge we have gained about the photon s polarization will takes the cost of blurring the other , non - commuting variable , obeying an uncertainty relation of the form : p_x p_y 2i[p_x , p_y ] .",
    "[ eq : uncer ]    fig .",
    "3 demonstrates this principle .",
    "once @xmath14 is ascertained , @xmath15 is disrupted ; a second @xmath10 measurement will yield either @xmath11 ( @xmath13 ) or @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , randomly .",
    "this is similar to the ordinary interference effect in a mach - zender interferometer ( mzi ) , where obtaining which - path information disrupts the photon s initial momentum .",
    "polarization destroys the @xmath10 polarization even when the measurement has been carried out by a single detector that did not click . ]    here a peculiar possibility emerges : what happens if , in order to measure @xmath14 , we place only _ one _ detector on one of the two routes ? if the detector clicks , the answer is clear : this is an ordinary measurement , hence we should observe the above disruption of @xmath15 .",
    "the situation becomes more intriguing in the remaining 50% of the cases , when the single detector clicks not .",
    "although no observable interaction has taken place , the very silence of the detector indicates that the photon has traversed the other path , thereby disclosing the photon s polarization with certainty .",
    "hence , @xmath15 should be disrupted in this case too , just because the silent detector _ could _ have clicked !",
    "this  interaction free measurement \" @xcite has been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical study in the last few years @xcite(see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) . in the present context , it has two unique features that warrant attention .",
    "first , with a simple modification , interaction - free measurement can be partial , leaving the wave function in a certain degree of superposition even after the measurement .",
    "second , it can be completely reversed .",
    "nearly always , measurement is regarded as a single event , whereby the superposition of all possible states gives its place to one state . in reality",
    ", however , there can be many intermediate stages in the measurement process , stages that only change the initial probabilities without yet giving a definite result .",
    "@xcite    following is a simple apparatus for partial measurements .",
    "let a photon be split by a calcite in the above manner .",
    "next , with the aid of many partly - silvered mirrors , let the @xmath3 beam split further into 100 beams .",
    "the transmission coefficients of the mirrors are graded such that all the 100 beams have an equal intensity of 1% of the original beam ( fig .",
    "the first mirror transmits @xmath18 of the incident beam , the second @xmath19 and so on , with the @xmath20 mirror transmitting @xmath7 of the beam , and the last one being a solid mirror .",
    "similarly , let the @xmath6 beam split into another 100 by the same technique .",
    "the photon is now in a superposition of 200 beams , such that , if its polarization along the @xmath0 direction is @xmath1 it might be detected in one out of the lower 100 beams , whereas if its polarization is @xmath4 it might be detected in one out of the 100 upper beams .",
    "finally , let a complementary series of mirrors re - unite all 200 beams into two @xmath3 and @xmath6 beams , and let a reversed @xmath0 calcite re - unite the resulting beams .",
    "the apparatus keeps the paths of all the beams in the same length , so as to keep the beams in phase .",
    "this way , the entire splitting process is reversed and the photon re - emerges as one single beam .    here",
    "too , we can demonstrate the superposition of the photon s @xmath0 polarization by performing two @xmath10 polarization measurements , one before and one after the splitting and re - unification processes .",
    "as long as no measurement is performed , the superposition will remain intact and all the photon will always emerge in the same state as it entered the apparatus , e.g. , @xmath13 as in fig .",
    "this setup enables performing partial measurements .",
    "we can now remove one of the mirrors and place a detector , as demonstrated on the third beam of the @xmath3 branch of fig .",
    "if the detector clicks , we know for certain that the photon s polarization is @xmath3 and the measurement is complete . in 99.5% of the cases , however , the detector will not click .",
    "this constitutes an interaction - free measurement , which should alter the wave function . yet , since the portion of the wave function thus measured is so tiny , the superposition will change only slightly , = ( + ) + , and will continue slightly changing for each further measurement on the remaining beams that yields no click . in other words , each interaction - free measurement slightly reduces the probability that the photon s polarization is @xmath3 , thereby increasing its probability to have a @xmath6 polarization . for @xmath21 detectors on the @xmath1 branch ,",
    "the effect on the wave - function will be & & ( + ) + & & + + & & = + , [ eq : measn ] where @xmath22 is the intensity of the ( unmeasured ) @xmath3 beam : = .",
    "[ eq : alpha ] let us denote the operator of partial polarization measurement in the @xmath0 up direction with intensity @xmath22 as : .",
    "( note again that @xmath22 is the unmeasured intensity ) . +",
    "this operator obeys the following multiplication law : =.    a familiar question , central to quantum theory , now poses itself : _ does partial measurement change merely our knowledge about the photon or is this a real physical change going on with the photon s state ? _ interaction - free measurement provides a straightforward way to show that the latter is true .",
    "recall that , prior to the photon s splitting along the @xmath0 direction , its polarization has been measured along the @xmath10 direction and was found to be @xmath13 .",
    "all one has to do now is to reunite the @xmath3 and the @xmath6 beams , and then measure again the @xmath10 polarization .",
    "if no attempt has been made to determine which of the 200 paths the photon took in the @xmath0 direction , the photon will emerge from the interferometer with its @xmath0 polarization unmeasured , hence its @xmath10 polarization will remain @xmath13 with 100% certainty .",
    "if , however , a measurement has been made to find out the photon s @xmath0 polarization , this measurement will have a proportionate effect .",
    "if one of the detectors click , then the measurement is complete and the photon s @xmath10 polarization will be totally disrupted , as in fig .",
    "but if the measurement is interaction - free  i.e. , a few beams measured with no click  the @xmath10 polarization will be only partly disrupted ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . instead of a pure @xmath13 state",
    ", we will have : & &  + & = & + + & = & + .",
    "[ eq : psia ]    this change of the wave function is an objective , physical event .",
    "measuring the photon s @xmath10 polarization before and after the partial measurement will show that , at the statistical level , the @xmath10 polarization has been disrupted proportionately to the knowledge we gained about the @xmath0 polarization .",
    "let us now turn to the way partial measurement obeys the uncertainty principle .",
    "the effect of a partial measurement of @xmath14 on @xmath15 can be regarded as a rotation of the polarization plane : drawing a vector with the @xmath6 component as the @xmath0 ordinate and the @xmath3 component as the @xmath10 ordinate , will give @xmath23 as the angle of the polarization plane .",
    "the initial state of @xmath13 has two equal components of the @xmath0 polarization , namely , @xmath6 and @xmath3 , resulting in @xmath24 . when a partial @xmath14 measurement is taken , the @xmath3 component diminishes while the @xmath6 component increases , causing the polarization plane to rotate clockwise , until a complete measurement gives a pure @xmath6 state ( chart 1 ) .",
    "chart 1 also allows us to look at the vectors without normalizing @xmath25 for @xmath26 : the formulation given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psia ] ) keeps the polarization vectors normalized since it counts only the cases where @xmath13 or @xmath17 were measured  excluding all the cases where a complete measurement took place and ended up with a click in one of the @xmath3 detectors .",
    "an efficient way to look at the wave - function is to keep track of these @xmath3 measurements . in this case , the probabilities for @xmath13 and @xmath17 will not sum to 1 , and the vector in chart 1 will get shorter as @xmath22 diminishes . formally : [ eq : psita ] & = & + + & = & + .",
    "[ eq : psiat ] this fact will turn out to be important later .",
    "we can now calculate the correlation coefficient between the initial and the final @xmath10 polarizations as a function of the magnitude of the partial measurement : c_y()=^2=(1 + ) ^2 .",
    "@xmath27 ranges from 1 ( when a total correlation is kept ) to 0.5 ( when we have no correlation at all , since there is an equal probability to find @xmath13 or @xmath17 ) .",
    "for example , if measurements have been carried out on 50 out of the 100 @xmath3 beams , yielding no click , then @xmath28 and the agreement between the @xmath10 polarization before and after the @xmath14 measurement will be :    @xmath29 indeed , since the @xmath0 and @xmath10 polarization directions are noncommuting variables , they satisfy the uncertainty relations mentioned in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uncer ] ) , and when applied to the above case of partial measurement , p_x=2 1 + , p_y=1 - 1 + , which vary with @xmath22 as in chart 2 .",
    "it is easily seen that as @xmath22 increases ( that is , fewer measurements on the @xmath3 branch ) , @xmath30 also increases and @xmath31 decreases .",
    "that means that the more we measure on the @xmath3 branch , the more precise knowledge we _ gain _ about @xmath14 ( hence @xmath30 decreases ) , and the more knowledge we _ lose _ about @xmath15 ( hence @xmath31 increases ) .",
    "an intriguing peculiarity of partial measurement is that , in contrast to the ordinary one , it can sometimes be totally reversed . to do this",
    ", there is no need to time - reverse the operation of any detector ; one can merely repeat the partial measurement on the photon s opposite branch ( fig .  5 ) .    for example , let @xmath21 detectors be placed on @xmath21 paths of a photon s @xmath3 branch . on average , in @xmath32 of the cases , these detectors will not click .",
    "this is a partial measurement , its outcome being given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : measn ] ) . now let another battery of @xmath21 detectors be placed on @xmath21 paths of the same photon s @xmath6 branch . on average , in @xmath33 of the cases",
    ", none of these detectors will produce a click either .",
    "this will completely undo the measurement and turn the wave - function back to the initial superposition : & & ( + ) + & & + & & + + & & = + + & & + & & + + & & = ( + ) . according to the notation we used for the partial measurement",
    ", the erasure process will take the form : =1 .",
    "this reversal occurs when the two partial measurements on the opposing branches are of the same magnitude . in the more general case , of placing @xmath21 detectors on the @xmath3 branch and",
    "@xmath34 detectors on the @xmath6 branch , the correlation ( or rather the mismatch ) between the initial and final @xmath15 measurement will be : & &  + & = & + + & = & + + - , [ eq : psiab ] with correlation coefficient : c_y()=(+ ) ^2=(1 + ) ^2 , where @xmath22 and @xmath35 are the beam intensities of the @xmath6 and the @xmath3 branches , respectively , and @xmath36 is the ratio between them : = , = , k=. [ eq : abk ]    notice that @xmath37 depends on the ratio @xmath36 alone .",
    "that means , for example , that a measurement of 50% of the @xmath3 branch ( @xmath38 ) will yield exactly the same @xmath37 as a measurement of 90% of the @xmath3 branch and 80% of the @xmath6 branch , or 99% of the @xmath3 branch and 98% of the @xmath6 branch , etc .",
    "in other words , the exact number of paths on either branch does not matter , nor does their relative intensities , nor the number , nor the identity of the measured paths .",
    "the only thing that counts is the ratio of the _ unmeasured _ parts of the two branches !",
    "= /. consequently , the partial measurement operators in the @xmath0 direction are commutative : = = / = /. [ eq : commutative ]    this ratio looks natural when discussing a single photon , as interference is known to depend on the intensities of the various beams diverging and re - converging from the initial wave function .",
    "later , however , this ratio will prove to be of crucial significance as a proof for nonlocal influence between distant photons .",
    "an important feature of the erasure process is that it complies with the  no free lunch \" principle .",
    "any measurement on the @xmath6 path to restore the exact @xmath13 state will also diminish an equal part of the @xmath3 part , as seen in fig .",
    "6 . to trace the cost of the erasure",
    ", we must keep track of the measured portion of the beam , hence a formulation similar to eq .",

    "let us now summarize sections ii - iv : the splitting of the wave function into 200 paths enables carrying out a partial measurement , whose effect is manifested by the proportionate disruption of the interference effect .",
    "this setup also allows , in some cases , a complete erasure of the partial measurement and consequently a restoration of the interference pattern .",
    "is it possible to show that such a partial measurement has nonlocal effects ?",
    "our proof involves an experiment with two particles in a singlet state .",
    "we show that , when both photons are subjected to interferometry , the partial measurement and erasure performed on each photon disrupt and restore , respectively , the interference effects of _ both _ photons .",
    "consider , then , a pair of spacelike - separated photons , a and b , in an entangled state , each entering an apparatus of the form described in fig .",
    "this is a hybrid epr - pm experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "if both @xmath14 polarization are measured , they will be 100% correlated but the @xmath15 polarizations will be unrelated .",
    "conversely , if no detection is performed to find out which of the possible 200 paths any of the photons has taken , their @xmath0 polarization will remain unmeasured , hence their @xmath15 correlations will remain intact .",
    "now let some detectors be placed on @xmath21 out of the 100 paths of the @xmath3 branch of photon a. photon b , in contrast , will not undergo any measurement of @xmath14 , only of its @xmath15 .    in @xmath32 of the cases , all detectors measuring photon a will perform an interaction - free measurement , changing the wave function as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psia ] ) . but",
    "here , due to the singlet state connecting the two photons , a unique state evolves .",

    "this means that measurements of the @xmath10 polarization of photons a and b have a probability of @xmath41 to yield correlated results , and a probability of @xmath42 to yield opposite results .",
    "the latter probability will grow as the magnitude of the partial measurements on @xmath14 grows ( that is , as @xmath22 diminishes ) until the correlation drops to the random level of 50%-50% as @xmath22 drops to 0 in case of a complete measurement ( chart [ chart3 ] ) .    as we will show below , the fact that the photons remain entangled even _",

    "consider the erasure of a partial measurement as described in section [ se : partial ] .",

    "consider , first , the case of a single particle .",

    "( [ eq : psiab ] ) and ( [ eq : abk ] ) . to put it more pictorially , this is a natural consequence of the interference effect : if an interaction - free measurement has occurred , say , in 90% of the @xmath3 branch , and in 95% of the @xmath6 branch , then the entire wave function resides in the remaining 10 and 5 percents , yielding a @xmath47 value of 2 . hence , the resulting @xmath15 correlation would be identical to that obtained by measuring just 50% of the @xmath6 branch alone ( giving again , @xmath60 ) .",
    "now , when considering the interference effects of _ two _ such photons in the epr setup , the nonlocality assumption yields another straightforward prediction that differs from the local assumption :    local argument b : : :    the above deviation from ordinary subtraction rules stems from the    interference effects occurring in each photon , regardless of what    happens with the other photon .",
    "nonlocal refutation : : :    the singlet state obliges the above subtraction rules to equally hold    even when the @xmath3 branch is measured in    photon a and the @xmath6 branch is measured in    photon b. this effect is obliged by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cyepr ] ) , which shows that    the @xmath10 polarization coefficient    @xmath58 is a function of the    measurement ratio @xmath47 alone .",
    "correlation can not occur if we    perform the undoing on _ both _",
    "photons at the same time . by    eqs .",
    "( [ eq : measepr ] ) and ( [ eq : psiaepr ] ) , the surplus undoing    constitutes a measurement in itself , which would disrupt again the    correlation . for any partial measurement that has changed the initial    superposition",

    "this indicates    that each measurement of one photon instantly affects the interference    effects observed in the other photon . ]    to summarize , in all cases in which interaction - free measurements are carried out on the opposing branches @xmath3 and @xmath6 , they mutually cancel out in the same way , _ no matter whether they have been carried out on the same photon or on two entangled ones .",
    "_ this indicates that each measurement effects the distant photon too .",
    "let us consider the next difference between quantum theory and the local prediction :    local argument c : : :    all the effects stem from a simple pre - established correlation between    the photons , committing them to give the same results to the partial    measurements .    but such an argument enforces nonlocality in a new way :    nonlocal refutation : : :    in order for each single photon to be capable of responding to a    certain number of detectors with silence , the photon must maintain a    nonlocal connection between all the 200 parts of its wave function    traversing distant paths . after all , the photon can not know in advance    on which paths the experimenter will choose to place the detectors !",
    "this aspect of the experiment parallels the last - minute choice of the polarization direction in aspect & grangier @xcite experiment or the ghz @xcite experiment .",
    "a realization of the experiment would therefore require a random process for choosing the location and number of the @xmath21 out of the 100 paths to be measured .",
    "we have therefore proved that either the two photons maintain nonlocal correlation between them , or each photon maintains nonlocal correlation between its distant beams .",
    "the latter interpretation would join hardy s @xcite and albert _ et al . _",
    "s @xcite proofs for the nonlocality of a single photon .",
    "either way , nonlocality is inescapable .    the setup in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] also points out the difficulty in applying counterfactuals to quantum mechanics : suppose we measure 50 of the 100 @xmath3 beams of photon a. a possible result of such an experiment might be that photon a finishes in the @xmath13 path , while photon b goes on the @xmath17 path .",
    "a possible description of such a situation will be : _ there is a 3% probability that the photons will be anti - correlated , and this is one of those cases . _ but then , a counterfactual can be presented : what would have been the result had we placed detectors in front of 50 out of the 100 beams of the @xmath3 branch of photon b too ?",
    "the answer is intriguing : since doing so will completely undo the measurement on photon a , photon b must either hit one of the 50 detectors or completely agree with the @xmath10 measurement of photon a. since our photon did not agree with it , it must have been captured by one of the 50 detectors !",
    "this imposes another odd counterfactual :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ when we place a battery of counter - measuring detectors on path b , they `` magically '' capture all the photons that _ were about _ to disagree with the @xmath10 measurement of photon a , have we not placed the counter - measuring detectors . _",

    "one must rather accept the objective reality of the wave - function .",
    "only such a view can accept that the 50 detectors on photon b cancel exactly the 50 measurements done on photon a.",
    "let us now give a general nonlocality proof for partial measurements .",
    "we shall consider a local hypothesis that tries to maintain locality despite the above predictions and show that it must violate an inequality theorem .",
    "local argument d : : :    each pair of photons uses a pre - established algorithm that assigns a    definite @xmath15 value for each partial measurement : for any    number of paths that were interaction - freely measured , the photons    would yield some preestablished @xmath10 polarization .",
    "the    resulting list of @xmath15 values is infinite , matching every    possible degree of partial measurement .",
    "nonlocal refutation : : :    the alleged algorithm must satisfy two restrictions : ( 1 ) in every    pair , both photons must obey the same algorithm ( though in reverse    polarities ) : if photon a undergoes a measurement of 30% on its    @xmath3 branch , and photon b undergoes the same    measurement of its @xmath6 branch , their    @xmath15 measurement _ must _ agree on each single experiment    ( @xmath59 , hence    @xmath52 ) .",
    "this , indeed ,    explains the apparent  erasure , \" where opposite partial measurements    on the two photons restore the initial correlations .",
    "( 2 ) however , the    algorithm must assign the particular @xmath10 polarization to    the _ ratio _ of the intensities of the photon s",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath6    branches ( that is @xmath61 for photon a and    @xmath62 for photon b ) .",
    "the correlation    ratio @xmath58 makes this fact    evident : a measurement of 50% on the @xmath3    branch of photon a yields @xmath63 , but    many other measurements on photon b will result    @xmath64 too ( 0/50 , 60/80 , 80/90 ,    etc . ) , equating @xmath58 to 1 and    restoring the photons @xmath15 correlation .",
    "+    now , restrictions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) refute the nonlocal argument by breaking    a bell - like inequality in the following way : consider an experiment    where photon a has @xmath65 and photon b    has @xmath64 . here ,",
    "@xmath66 , hence    @xmath67 , implying that the    @xmath15 correlation between the photons is disrupted in 3%    of the cases .",
    "if one believes in a pre - existing algorithm directing    each photon , the following counterfactual must be true : should b now    had @xmath63 and it repeated the same    measurement , but with a different opponent , c , with square the    measurement ratio : @xmath68 , the    results _ must _ have been the same ! since b must give a    @xmath15 measurement according to it",
    "s    @xmath63 ratio , it must measure exactly    the same result that it gave for that ratio in the actual experiment    ( in accordance with restriction ( 1 )  a and b must obey the same    algorithm  and restriction ( 2 )  the algorithm depends on    @xmath61 alone ) . since @xmath47    remains with the same value ( @xmath69 ) ,",
    "@xmath58 remains 0.97 , so b and c    must give non - correlated results in 3% of the cases too .",
    "this imposes    another counterfactual : if a measured    @xmath65 against c with    @xmath68 , they could give , at most ,    different results in @xmath70 of the cases . however ,    when we compute @xmath58 for this    case ( @xmath71 ) , the result is 0.90 . which means that they    _ must _ give non - correlated results in 10% of the cases ! since    @xmath72 , that condition can not be met , and we    conclude that the local argument is false . q.e.d .",
    "this proof will be generalized below for a broad range of ratios .",
    "that is , for a certain measurement ratio @xmath73 , the disagreement between a and c is greater than the sum of disagreement between a and b plus b and c ( see chart [ ch : refutation ] ) :    if the difference between measurement ratios of particles a and b is @xmath74 , the disagreement in @xmath15 measurements will be : _ a - b=1-c_y()=1-()^2 .",
    "the difference between measurement ratios of b and c will be @xmath73 too , yielding the same value for @xmath75 ( since it depends on the ratio @xmath73 alone ) , hence the maximal sum of the disagreement between a and c will be twice the above amount : _ a - b+_b - c=2 - 2()^2 .",
    "however , the measured disagreement between a and c will be according to @xmath76 : _ a - c=1-()^2 .    in chart [ ch : refutation ]",
    "we show the graphs of these functions , which shows that in the region @xmath77 the disagreement @xmath78 is higher than the sum @xmath79 , thereby disproving any possible local explanation .",
    "it should also be pointed out that local argument d is especially ludicrous when we consider its _ post hoc _ explanations for the unique quantitative features of joint interferometry .",
    "why should the ratio 50%-0% of measurement and erasure give the same result as 75%-50% , 90%-80% and so on ?",
    "a local model can  explain \" these phenomena only by adding arbitrary assumptions without any rationale other than the need to account for such unexpected results .",
    "in the nonlocal account , in contrast , these peculiarities are straightforwardly derived from _",
    "i ) _ the very nature of interference , and _",
    "ii ) _ the assumption that the two interferometries affect one another due to the quantum entanglement of the two photons .    finally let the proof be extended to include all pairs :    local argument e : : :    perhaps only those photons that give rise to partial measurements    maintain nonlocal correlation , while the others , which react to the    measurement with a click in the detectors ( complete measurement ) , have    pre - fixed correlation and do not affect one other nonlocally .",
    "these    photons , in other words , have  agreed \" in advance to respond to the    detectors with clicks , and therefore need not show correlation in    their @xmath10 polarization .",
    "the refutation of this hypothesis ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) is just like the proof we used in section [ sec : free ] :    nonlocal refutation : : :    in order for some photons to be capable of responding to a certain    number of detectors with a click , each such a photon must maintain a    nonlocal connection between the 200 distant parts of its wave    function .",
    "for the photon can not know in advance in which of the paths    are detectors going to be placed .",
    "therefore , _ once the partial    measurements confirm the nonlocal prediction , the complete    measurements equally indicate nonlocal effects . _",
    "since partial measurement does not take the cost of disentanglement , it can be followed by many consecutive partial measurements , all of which affect the distant entangled particle .",
    "this is in marked contrast with the ordinary epr experiment , which allows the nonlocal transfer of only one variable .",
    "consider the following case : of two entangled particles , one undergoes partial measurement of its @xmath0 polarization , then of its @xmath10 polarization , and then of its @xmath80 polarization ` direction ' to denote a circular polarization .",
    "the @xmath80 direction is taken from the spin measurement of spin-@xmath7 particles which obeys the same relations as the @xmath0 , @xmath10 , and circular polarization measurement .",
    "the appropriate operators will be @xmath81 and @xmath82 . ] .",
    "suppose also that all partial measurements were very close to 100% ( say , 90% each ) .",
    "of course , such a multitude of measurements increases the probability for a click which would ruin the experiment , but if all partial measurements succeeded , the state of the two entangled particles is : _1 90%_1 90%_1 90%",
    ".    the resulting pair of particles is poorly correlated , but an inverted set of counter measurements , performed on the particle that was measured , can restore the initial correlation . since measurements in orthogonal directions can not commute , the counter measurements must be performed in a reverse order : & & _1 90%_1 90% + & & ( _1 90%_1 90% ) + & & _1 90%_1 90% + & & = _1 90%(_1 90%_1 90%)_1 90% + & & = ( _1 90%_1 90% ) + & & = . in general , any set of partial measurements gives a complex linear combination of the kind : & = & ( a+ib)_1_2+(c+id)_1_2 + & & + ( e+if)_1_2+(g+ih)_1_2 . a pair of particles , therefore , can carry up to eight real parameters .",
    "such a combination of states , once successfully created on one particle , shows up in the distant particle too , a case that is impossible in the ordinary epr experiment . in terms of quantum information , this state far exceeds the present , single - bit nonlocal correlation .",
    "let us note another interesting peculiarity of multiple partial measurement : if one particle has undergone a series of partial measurements , then the erasure of these measurements can be attempted only in the reverse order ( last first , first last ) . if , however , the erasure is attempted on the other particle of the entangled pair  even after a time - like interval  the order of the erasures must be of that of the measurements ( first first , last last ) .",
    "this fact seems to lend support to cramer s @xcite  transactional interpretation , \" where the measurement of one particle affects the other particle by traversing a  feynman zigzag \" through time .",
    " quantum erasure \" denotes an operation that constitutes the time reversal of the measurement process , undoing the the measurement s outcome and turning the wave function back to its initial pure state .",
    "it has become the focus of intensive study during the last few years because of its far - reaching theoretical and technological bearings , such as quantum computation and reversibility .",
    "most notable of these works is that of scully _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite who demonstrated erasure of a quantum measurement in a double - slit experiment with atoms . in this experiment ,",
    "the two parts of the wave function , prior to being reunited , pass through a small cavity where they undergo a measurement that can tell which path the atom has traversed .",
    "immediately after the measurement , while the beams are still inside the cavities , the  which path \" information is totally erased . scully _ et al .",
    "_ showed that after leaving the cavity , the two beams gave rise to normal interference , just as if no measurement took place .",
    "this experiment , however , has two shortcomings that obscure the uniqueness of quantum erasure .",
    "first , the experiment makes it impossible to know the actual result of the measurement that has been later erased .",
    "this impossibility is imposed by the very definition of the experiment : if an experimenter observes the result of a measurement , this observation itself becomes part of the measurement , hence erasure requires completely erasing that observer s brain processes as well .",
    "therefore , one can only _ infer _ that detection and its erasure took place on one of the two beams , but never know which beam gave rise to the initial click .",
    "the same holds for the proposals of greenberger & yasin , @xcite becker , @xcite and others , reviewed and refined by kwiat _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "our proposal overcomes this limitation .",
    "when the measurement is partial , it is as observable as any other measurement , and similarly its erasure .",
    "the reason for this has been pointed out earlier : unlike the prevailing techniques , ours does not require time - reversing any measuring instrument , thereby avoiding the enormous technical difficulties involved with proper atomic control and thermodynamic isolation .",
    "rather , the only thermodynamic price we have to pay is that , the closer the measurement gets to a complete measurement , the more likely it is to end up in a click , whereby erasure will be no more possible .",
    "similarly , erasure itself might end up in a click .",
    "we thus comply with the second law of thermodynamics at the statistical level .",
    "still , in a large enough series of experiments , we can have many cases in which we can directly observe a measurement that is close enough to complete measurement , and then observe its complete erasure .",
    "but the most intriguing consequence of quantum erasure is obscured by the second shortcoming of scully _ et al .",
    "_ s experiment : they carried out the measurement and its erasure on _ both _ halves of the wave function .",
    "this , we suggest , is not only unnecessary but suppresses the nonlocal aspect of the process .",
    "elitzur @xcite has proposed to repeat scully s experiment dropping one of the measurement and its erasure on one side .",
    "the argument was that if interference shows up in this case too , it would prove that undoing one half of the wave function instantly  unmeasures \" the other half too .",
    "however , this proposal suffers from the same shortcoming as the above erasure experiments : the measurement and its erasure can only be inferred and never directly observed .",
    "brun and barnett , @xcite on the other hand , proposed to carry out the measurement on one arm and the cancellation on the other , arguing that both operations should affect both arms .",
    "unfortunately , all these experiments study single - particle interference , where the two parts of the wave function are eventually reunited .",
    "this does not allow nonlocality to be tested .",
    "a local theory could argue that both the measurement and its erasure affect only the measured half .",
    "partial measurement , again , overcomes all these shortcomings .",
    "it allows a direct observation of both the measurement and its erasure .",
    "furthermore , by performing the measurement on one photon and the erasure on the other , and by _ not _ uniting the two distant photons , we are in a position to affirm : _ not only quantum measurement , but also its erasure , affects the other particle in the epr experiment_. notice also that , unlike the micromaser cavities and laser beams in scully _ et al . _ s experiment , our method carries out the erasure by much simpler optical means .",
    "in a discussion that has become a classic , feynman @xcite defined the double - slit experiment as  the core of the mystery of quantum mechanics . \"",
    "albert @xcite has generalized this insight in his lucid exposition of quantum mechanics , where he showed that any quantum - mechanical variable is a superposition of another , noncommuting one .",
    "he went on to show how any variable could emerge from the interference effect of its conjugate .",
    "this is what the present work does with the @xmath0 and @xmath10 polarizations , illustrating the uncertainty principle by the familiar phenomenon of interference .",
    "it is this highly visualizable phenomenon upon which the present proof for nonlocality is based , not requiring bell s theorem . in so doing ,",
    "we have also extended the epr argument to two conclusions : _",
    "i ) _ nonlocal effects are caused not only by a complete measurement but even by its minutest stages . _",
    "ii ) _ nonlocal effects are caused not only by a measurement but also by the time - reversed process . therefore , nonlocality needs not cease once the two particles in the epr experiment are measured ; they can remain entangled in spite of many successive measurements , maintaining the strange  dialogue \" between them for a long time .",
    "our proof also extends bell s proof in that , whereas bell s inequality is based on the polarization measurements along varying angles , we present a new inequality that holds within the same angle of polarization for both particles .    partial measurement gives a new twist to the question whether god plays dice .",
    "our experiment shows that not only does god cast a dice every time a polarization measurement is performed , but that , when the dice takes some time to fall , god preserves the right to change his mind as many times as he pleases .",
    "he can , for example , give 99% for a particle to have a @xmath3 polarization , and then , upon the @xmath83 partial measurement , change his mind and make the polarization @xmath6 . give him further opportunities by dividing the @xmath83 measurement into further 100 partial measurements , and he might change his mind time and again .    to summarize , our proof highlights a fundamental peculiarity of quantum mechanics .",
    "suppose that a classical object resides in one out of 200 closed boxes .",
    "opening some boxes and not finding the object there only alters the observer s _ knowledge _ ( or , better , ignorance ) about the object s location . in quantum mechanics , in contrast , every such non - detection brings about a real change in the particle s state , empirically proved in our epr - pm setting with utmost quantitative precision .",
    "it is this lack of differentiation between ontology and epistemology  any change in the observer s _ knowledge _ corresponding to precisely the same change in the _ state _ of the thing observed  that makes quantum mechanics so unique among all natural sciences .",

    "<S> partial measurement turns the initial superposition not into a definite outcome but into a greater probability for it . </S>",
    "<S> the probability can approach 100% , yet the measurement can undergo complete quantum erasure . in the epr setting , we prove that i ) every partial measurement nonlocally creates the same partial change in the distant particle ; and ii ) every erasure inflicts the same erasure on the distant particle s state . </S>",
    "<S> this enables an epr experiment where the nonlocal effect does not vanish after a single measurement but keeps  traveling \" back and forth between particles . </S>",
    "<S> we study an experiment in which two distant particles are subjected to interferometry with a partial  which path \" measurement . such a measurement causes a variable amount of correlation between the particles . </S>",
    "<S> a new inequality is formulated for same - angle polarizations , extending bell s inequality for different angles . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting nonlocality proof is highly visualizable , as it rests entirely on the interference effect . </S>",
    "<S> partial measurement also gives rise to a new form of entanglement , where the particles manifest correlations of multiple polarization directions . </S>",
    "<S> another novelty in that the measurement to be erased is fully observable , in contrast to prevailing erasure techniques where it can never be observed . </S>",
    "<S> some profound conceptual implications of our experiment are briefly pointed out .    </S>",
