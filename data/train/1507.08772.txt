    "quantum critical phenomena is extensively developing subject in modern condensed matter physics , in both theoretical and experimental frontiers.@xcite the most vivid manifestations of quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) arise in low - dimensional systems such as cuprates and iron pnictides .",
    "however , quantum critical behaviour is also found in three - dimensional ( 3d+time ) systems .",
    "well - known example of 3d compound with a magnetic quantum critical point ( qcp ) is tlcucl@xmath4.@xcite under normal conditions the material is in the magnetically disordered phase , while pressure drives qpt to the antiferromagnetically ordered neel phase .",
    "quantum critical properties of a system can be significantly influenced by the presence of impurities .",
    "for instance , substitution of cu atoms in the parent compound tlcucl@xmath4 with low concentration of nonmagnetic mg impurities creates an uncompensated spin @xmath5 at the impurity site , which induces magnetization around the impurities and even lead to the formation of a long - range magnetic order in the macroscopic volume of the crystal.@xcite in the magnetically disordered phase the magnetization cloud around each impurity exponentially decays over a few lattice spacings from the impurity .",
    "but in the vicinity of the qcp the effect of impurity - induced magnetization can be notably enhanced .",
    "experimental observations reveal an interplay between the impurity - induced staggered magnetization and a quantum criticality near the qcp .",
    "@xcite    despite of the vast amount of theoretical work on the impurity - induced magnetization in quasi-1d and 2d systems ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , we are not aware of similar studies in the relation to 3d materials . in the present paper",
    "we consider a single impurity with spin @xmath0 embedded in the 3d antiferromagnet ( af ) , which is close to the qcp , separating magnetically disordered and magnetically ordered phases .",
    "conceptually , the problem is similar to the kondo effect ( see @xcite ) , since , as we show below , the spin cloud screens the impurity s spin at the qcp ( bose - kondo effect@xcite ) .",
    "we study the spatial distribution of the nonlocal spin density and the staggered magnetization induced by the impurity .",
    "we show , that when approaching the qcp from the disordered phase , the spin density around the impurity decays as @xmath1 with logarithmic corrections and the total spin accumulated in the delocalized cloud is equal to @xmath0 .",
    "we also demonstrate that the induced staggered magnetization decays as @xmath2 .    closely related to the problem of the impurity - induced spin density and",
    "the impurity - induced neel order is a phenomenon of spin - charge separation ( scs ) .",
    "conventional definition of scs relies on the existence of two quasiparticles carrying spin and charge (  spinon  and  chargon  ) , which is the case in 1d tomonaga - luttinger liquid of strongly interacting electrons.@xcite .",
    "by contrast , in higher spatial dimensions there are no known systems with scs in the conventional definition",
    ". however , scs exists in 2d models , such as hole - doped af @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the recent research @xcite reports pronounced scs in the vicinity of the magnetic qcp . in the latter case , the precise meaning of scs is different from scs in tomonaga - luttinger liquid .",
    "a hole creates a spin cloud around the charge with radius which diverges at the qcp . as a result",
    "the hole s spin becomes delocalized and spatially separated from the impurity s charge pinned to the impurity s site , that basically means scs . in the present article",
    "we show that such scs also occurs in 3d systems near the qcp .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in the section",
    "ii we introduce an effective field theory describing 3d af doped with a single impurity in the vicinity of the qcp . considering interaction of the doped af with a probe magnetic field",
    ", we introduce an operator of the spin density and explain how we calculate the induced spin density . here",
    "we also provide method of calculation of the staggered magnetization around the impurity .",
    "the rest of the paper is divided into two parts , which correspond to the two techniques of the calculations : self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) and renormalization group ( rg ) approach in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "section iii refers to the calculation of the spin density in scba for the most physically interesting case of the impurity with spin @xmath7 . in the section",
    "iv we again calculate the impurity - induced nonlocal spin density , the local spin of the impurity and the staggered magnetization using rg technique .",
    "we also consider a semiclassical limit of the impurity with a large spin .",
    "we draw our conclusions in the section v.",
    "an example of a 3d lattice model which incorporates main features of magnetic quantum criticality is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d_af_lattice ] .",

    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d_af_lattice ] .",
    "the vacancy acts as an effective impurity with the spin @xmath7 .",
    "the vacancy in the lattice induces a nonlocal magnetization cloud around the impurity site . in the present paper",
    "we will calculate spatial distribution of the spin density and the staggered magnetization in the spin cloud around the impurity .",
    "magnetic properties of the critical system are determined by low - energy magnetic excitations .",
    "the magnetic excitations are magnons in the neel phase and triplons in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "hereafter we use the term magnons for the both types of quasiparticles .",
    "the effective theory , which describes magnons in the vicinity of the qcp is based on the following lagrangian , see e.g. @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the magnon field , @xmath17 is the magnon gap ( squared ) , @xmath18 is a four - magnon coupling constant , @xmath19 is the time derivative , @xmath20 is the three - dimensional gradient .",
    "hereafter we set plank constant and magnon speed equal to unity @xmath21 . in the disordered magnetic phase @xmath22 .",
    "near the qcp the magnon gap @xmath23 .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ initlagrangianmagn ] ) contains quadratic terms as well as quartic term @xmath24 , describing the magnon self - action .",
    "the magnon self - action results in the renormalization of the magnon gap @xmath25 in the lagrangian ( [ initlagrangianmagn ] ) . from the one - loop rg calculations@xcite it follows , that in the disordered phase the evolution of the renormalized gap is given by @xmath26^ { - \\frac{n+2}{n+8}},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 in the present case of the @xmath28 universality class system , and @xmath29 is a positive constant , determined by an ultraviolet scale @xmath30 .",
    "besides that , the @xmath31 term leads to renormalization of magnon quasiparticle residue.@xcite however , the change of the residue appears only in the two - loop renormalization group , and therefore is small .",
    "hence , for our purposes we drop out the self - action term from the lagrangian ( [ initlagrangianmagn ] ) and substitute the bare magnon gap to a renormalized value @xmath32 .",
