    "order - disorder transitions are often found in complex systems .",
    "they have been identified in physical systems such as bose - einstein condensates and ferromagnets and in biological , chemical and financial systems .",
    "phase transitions are found , for example , in the behaviour of bacteria @xcite , locusts @xcite , voting games and utilisation of resource in markets @xcite .",
    "these systems have in common the property that there is competition between fluctuations driving the system towards disorder , and inter - element interactions driving the system towards order .",
    "insight into such systems can be gained using simple models .",
    "although the dynamics of individual elements are difficult to predict , one can identify macroscopic parameters that characterise the behaviour of the system .",
    "these can be approached through dimensional analysis , e.g. buckingham s @xmath0 theorem @xcite .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    a generic challenge in real world measurements of physical , chemical , biological or economic systems is that they yield datasets that are , in essence , sparse .",
    "single elements such as tracer particles in turbulent flow , tagged birds or dolphins in a group or a constituent of a financial index may , or may not , adequately sample the full underlying system behaviour . in consequence , the behaviour of a finite number of individual elements may , or may not , provide a proxy for the behaviour of the entire system . if the system behaviour is known to exhibit a phase transition ,",
    "the question arises how this can best be captured from analysis of the dynamics of individual elements .",
    "previously , for example , both mutual information ( mi ) @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite and susceptibility have been shown to be sensitive to the phase transition in the ising spin model of ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "mi can also extract correlation , or dependence , between causally linked but spatiotemporally separated observed parameters : for example , between in - situ plasma measurements in the solar wind , and the ionospheric response detected by ground based measurements on earth @xcite ; and within the brains of alzheimer s disease patients @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    here we compare the use of mi and susceptibility to quantify the location of the phase transition in the dimensionless parameter space of the vicsek _",
    "model @xcite .",
    "there are numerous statistical methods for analysing systems with many degrees of freedom , dating back to work by helmholtz and boltzmann in the 19th century , see for example @xcite @xcite and references therein .",
    "the microscopic behaviour of the vicsek system , described below , does not conserve energy or momentum and this precludes a microscopic understanding of energy , momentum or any related quantities in the system .",
    "the driving characteristic of the system is entropy : this is augmented by the random forcing of the particles , and removed by their mutual interactions , which create correlation . with this in mind , we examine mutual information as a natural choice for capturing the entropy flow in the system , and characterising the system state with respect to its order parameters .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    we find that when full knowledge of the system is available , that is when all the particles are tracked , the susceptibility is an accurate method for estimating the position of the phase transition in the vicsek model .",
    "however , if the data is limited to a sample of just a few particles out of a large number , or a subset of the complete data , this method is less accurate .    [ [ section-3 ] ]    we show that the mutual information of only a few particles , or of limited data from the whole system , can successfully locate the phase transition in dimensionless parameter space .",
    "for example we find that the mi of a timeseries of components of particle position or velocity is sufficient .",
    "we thus show that mi can provide a practical method to detect order - disorder transitions when only a few particles , or elements , of the system are observed .",

    "importantly the critical temperature for the ising model is picked out precisely by the peak in the mutual information of the whole system .",
    "this peak survives the coarse graining of the system very well , which raises the possibility of mutual information being useful in the study of other complex systems .",
    "in the 2d vicsek system there are three variables for each of the @xmath36 particles : their positions @xmath89 and the orientation of their velocities @xmath90 , giving three signals @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 each containing @xmath36 measurements at every time step .",
    "the simplest discretization of these signals @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath90 is to cover the range of the signals with equally spaced bins , so for position coordinate @xmath91 we have @xmath96 bins @xmath97 with width @xmath98 . then if @xmath15 particles are in the range @xmath99 we have probabilities : @xmath100 the single and joint probabilities @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are calculated in a similar manner .    [ [ section-10 ] ]    the key factor governing the accuracy with which mi is measured is to optimise the size of the bins used in the above procedure .",
    "if the bins are too large then resolution is lost , and the exact level of small scale structure and clustering can not be identified .",
    "if the bins are too small then at high noise the probability of finding a particle at a given point does not become smoothed over the whole system because individual particles can be resolved , giving @xmath105 even though the system is in a well mixed random state .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    there is no ideal bin structure yet determined for this method of mi calculation @xcite @xcite .",
    "the vicsek model has two natural length scales , @xmath7 the interaction radius and @xmath38 the box size , so that a good length scale to choose for discretization , when a snapshot of the whole system is being used , is the interaction radius @xmath7 .",
    "thus all our mutual information calculations made on the whole system use a bin size of @xmath106 , the diameter of the circle of interaction ; the bins are therefore squares of size @xmath107 in the @xmath108 plane .",

    "the mi falls to zero as @xmath115 and @xmath93 tend to uncorrelated noise ( see also @xcite ) . we would also expect the mi to fall to zero at sufficiently low @xmath13",

    "the errors on our measurements of mi are calculated from the standard deviation of measurements of mi calculated over 50 simulations at each noise @xmath13 . the error on the susceptibility",
    "is calculated in the same manner .",
    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    the error bars become larger at low @xmath13 because the mutual information includes the signatures of spatial clustering as well as velocity clustering in the measurement .",
    "thus at low @xmath13 , when extended clusters form , the mutual information will give a higher value for the more spatially extended axis of the cluster and a lower value for the less extended axis of the cluster .",
    "this implies that the shape and orientation of the ( usually single ) large cluster formed at low noise influences the mutual information",
    ". different measurements of mi thus arise for each implementation of the model , giving rise to the error seen at low @xmath13 .",
    "this could be corrected by using other approaches to computing mi , for example recurrence plotting @xcite @xcite , or a different distribution of bins ; these are more computationally intensive , however .",
    "[ [ section-14 ] ]    when",
    "estimated as the standard deviation over 50 repeated runs of the simulation , the error is found to be considerably larger , as a fraction of the overall measurement , for the susceptibility than for the mi .",
    "this is because the susceptibility is simply an average fluctuation over all the velocity vectors of the system ; whereas the mi also directly reflects the level of spatial ` clumpiness ' ( that is , spatial correlation ) of the particles .",
    "the detailed spatial distribution varies from one simulation to the next , but at fixed @xmath116 the degree of ` clumpiness ' does not .",
    "mutual information is able to quantify clustering ( correlation in space as well as velocity ) in a simple dynamical complex system , in a manner that identifies the order - disorder phase transition .",

    "this is a reasonable assumption to make for the vicsek model as it is ergodic while @xmath13 remains constant .",
    "[ [ section-15 ] ]    to calculate the susceptibility , we need to estimate the variance of the average velocity of each of these @xmath122 pseudo - systems .",
    "we therefore cut each section @xmath124 into @xmath125 further subsections @xmath126 , calculate the average velocity @xmath127 of these subsections and find their variance , giving @xmath128 the pseudo - system susceptibility .",

    "the peak in the susceptibility no longer coincides with @xmath39 and is shifted to the higher noise side of the phase transition .",

    "mutual information measured in terms of coordinates aligned with the preferred direction of motion is increased by the dispersion of particle positions and velocities , whereas mi measured in term of perpendicular coordinates is decreased because the positional and velocity dispersion are smaller in this direction .",

    "[ [ section-23 ] ]    when data is limited to observations of only ten particles out of 3000 , the error in the mutual information remains comparatively small , and the mutual information thus provides a better measurement than susceptibility of the position of the order - disorder phase transition ( fig [ fig : misus2 ] ) . when data is limited still further , such that only one line of sight component of the particle motion is available , the mutual information measurement remains sensitive enough to identify the critical noise of the phase transition , while the susceptibility does not ( figs [ fig : mi10binxxyy ] - [ fig : miminxxyy ] ) .",
    "[ [ section-24 ] ]    in this case the mutual information also provides an indication of the preferred axial direction of clumped particle motion at low noise .",
