    "observations of high - redshift co spectral line emissions have greatly increased our knowledge of galaxy assembly in the early universe . at redshifts",
    "z@xmath62 , this includes the discovery of turbulent star - forming disks with cold - gas mass fractions and star - formatio rates significantly larger than in present day galaxies @xcite .",
    "the high star - formation rates are correlated with large gas masses and luminous co emission lines @xcite observable to very high redshifts .",
    "a prominent example is the luminous submillimeter and hubble - deep - field source hdf 850.1 , which is at a redshift of z = 5.183 as determined by recent detections of co(6 - 5 ) , co(5 - 4 ) , and co(2 - 1 ) rotational line emissions , and also [ cii ] fine - structure emission in this source @xcite .",
    "the high redshift of hdf 850.1 offers the opportunity of setting cosmological constraints on the conversion factor from co line luminosities to gas masses , via the implied dark matter masses and the expected cosmic volume density of halos of a given mass .",
    "such analysis is the subject of our paper .",
    "+ co emitting molecular clouds , which provide the raw material for star formation , are usually assumed to have undergone complete conversion from atomic to molecular hydrogen .",
    "however , since h@xmath1 has strongly forbidden rotational transitions and requires high temperatures ( @xmath6500 k ) to excite its rotational lines , it is a poor tracer of cold ( @xmath12 100 k ) molecular gas .",
    "determining h@xmath1 gas masses in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies has therefore relied on tracer molecules . in particular",
    ", @xmath13co is the most commonly employed tracer of ism clouds ; aside from being the most abundant molecule after h@xmath1 , co has a weak dipole moment ( @xmath14 = 0.11 debye ) and its rotational levels are thus excited and thermalized by collisions with h@xmath1 at relatively low molecular hydrogen densities @xcite . + the molecular hydrogen gas mass",
    "is often obtained from the co luminosity by adopting a mass - to - luminosity conversion factor @xmath15 between the h@xmath1 mass and the j = 1 - 0 115 ghz co rotational transition @xcite .",
    "the value for @xmath0 has been empirically calibrated for the milky way galaxy by three independent techniques : _ ( i ) _ correlation of optical extinction with co column densities in interstellar dark clouds @xcite ; _ ( ii ) _ correlation of gamma - ray flux with the co line flux in the galactic molecular ring @xcite ; and _ ( iii ) _ observed relations between the virial mass and co line luminosity for galactic gmcs @xcite .",
    "these methods have all arrived at the conclusion that the conversion factor in our galaxy is fairly constant .",
    "the standard galactic value is @xmath0 = 4.6 m@xmath8/(k km@xmath5 pc@xmath16 ) .",
    "subsequent studies of co emission from unvirialized regions in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) found a significantly smaller ratio .",
    "for such systems , @xmath0 = 0.8 m@xmath8/(k km@xmath5 pc@xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "these values have been adopted by many @xcite to convert co j=1 - 0 line observations to total molecular gas masses , but without consideration of the dependence of @xmath0 on the average molecular gas conditions found in the sources being considered .",
    "since all current observational studies of @xmath0 leave its range and dependence on the average density , temperature , and kinetic state of the molecular gas still largely unexplored , its applicability to other systems in the local or distant universe is uncertain @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we estimate the co emitting gas masses in hdf 850.1 using the large - velocity - gradient ( lvg ) formalism to fit the observed emission line spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for a variety of model configurations , and for a comparison to the galactic and ulirg conversions . in ",
    "2 we outline the details of the lvg approach , including an overview of the escape probability method and a derivation of the gas mass from the line intensity of the modeled source . in  3 , we present the best fit set of parameters that reproduce hdf 850.1 s detected lines and calculate the corresponding molecular gas mass , assuming the co and [ cii ] emission lines originate from _",
    "( i ) _ separate unvirialized regions , _ ( ii ) _ separate virialized regions , _ _ ( iii)__uniformly mixed unvirialized regions , and _",
    "( iv ) _ uniformly mixed virialized regions .",
    "the inferred gas masses enable us to set lower - limits on the dark - matter halo mass for hdf 850.1 . in ",
    "4 we compare the estimated halo - masses to the number of such objects expected at high redshift in @xmath9cdm cosmology , and show that models with lower values of @xmath0 are favored .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our findings and their implications in  5 .",
    "we start by describing our procedure for quantitatively analyzing the [ cii ] and co emission lines detected at the position of hdf 850.1 using the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation .",
    "we consider a multi - level system with population densities of the _ _ i__th level given by _",
    "n@xmath17_. the equations of statistical equilibrium can then be written as : @xmath18 where _ l _ is the total number of levels included ; since the set of _ l _ statistical equations is not independent , one equation may be replaced by the conservation equation @xmath19 where _",
    "n@xmath20 _ is the number density of the given species in all levels . in our application ,",
    "@xmath21 = @xmath22 . following the notation of @xcite , _",
    "r@xmath23 _ is given in terms of the einstein coefficients , _",
    "a@xmath23 _ and _ b@xmath23 _ , and the collisional excitation ( _ i @xmath24 j_)and de - excitation rates ( _ i @xmath25 j _ ) _ c@xmath23 _ : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mean intensity corresponding to the transition from level _",
    "i _ to _ j _ averaged over the local line profile function @xmath28 . the total collisional rates @xmath29 depend on the individual temperature - dependent rate coefficients and collision partners , usually h@xmath1 and h for co +",
    "the difficulty in solving this problem is that the mean intensity at any location in the source is a function of the emission and varying excitation state of the gas all over the rest of the source , and is thus a nonlocal quantity . to obtain a general solution of the coupled sets of equations describing radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium",
    ", we adopt the approach developed by @xcite and extended by @xcite and @xcite and assume the existence of a large velocity gradient in dense clouds .",
    "this assumption is justified given the interstellar molecular line widths which range from a few up to a few tens of kilometers per second , far in excess of plausible thermal velocities in the clouds @xcite .",
    "they suggest that these observed velocity differences arise from large - scale , systematic , velocity gradients across the cloud , a hypothesis that lies in accord with the constraints provided by observation and theory .",
    "+ in the limit that the thermal velocity in the cloud is much smaller than the velocity gradient , the value of @xmath27 at any point in the cloud , when integrated over the line profile , depends only upon the local value of the source function and upon the probability that a photon emitted at that point will escape from the cloud without further interaction .",
    "thus @xmath27 becomes a purely local quantity , given by : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the line source function , @xmath32 assumed constant through the medium . in this expression @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "are the statistical weights of levels _ i _ and _ j _ respectively , @xmath35 is the ",

    "our inferred gas masses enable us to set cosmological constraints . for a particular set of cosmological parameters ,",
    "the number density of dark matter halos of a given mass can be inferred from the halo mass function .",
    "the sheth - tormen mass function , which is based on an ellipsoidal collapse model , expresses the comoving number density of halos _",
    "n _ per logarithm of halo mass _ m _ as , @xmath38 where a reasonably good fit to simulations can be obtained by setting _ a _ = 0.322 , _ a _ = 0.707 , and _ p",
    "_ = 0.3 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath39 is the mean mass density of the universe and @xmath40 = @xmath41 is the number of standard deviations away from zero that the critical collapse overdensity represents on mass scale _",
    "m_. integrating this comoving number density over a halo mass range and volume element thus yields _ n _ , the total number of halos observed within solid angle @xmath42 with mass greater than some _ m@xmath43 _ and redshift larger than some @xmath44 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the hubble constant , @xmath47 is the angular diameter distance , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the present - day density parameters of matter and vacuum , respectively .",
    "+    given the detection of hdf 850.1 , we can say that out of the hundreds of submillimetre - bright galaxies identified so far , at least one has been detected in the hubble deep field at a redshift z @xmath25 5 with a halo mass greater than or equal to the halo mass associated with this source .",
    "this observation , taken together with the theoretical number density predicted by the sheth - tormen mass function , constrains the halo mass associated with hdf 850.1 in the following way , @xmath50 where the solid angle covered by the hubble deep field is @xmath51 = 4.4 arcmin@xmath11 @xcite and a @xmath9cdm cosmology is assumed with h@xmath52 = 70 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath49 = 0.7 , and @xmath48 = 0.3 @xcite .",
    "@xmath53 , the minimum inferred halo mass for hdf 850.1 , is related to the halo s minimum baryonic mass component , a quantity derived in  3 via the lvg technique , in the following way , @xmath54 where the baryonic and the total matter density parameters are @xmath55 = 0.05 and @xmath48 = 0.27 respectively . each model s estimate of the minimum baryonic mass associated with hdf 850.1 corresponds to an estimate of _ n _ , the number of halos expected to be observed at a redshift z @xmath56 5 with mass m@xmath57 . given that one such source has already been observed , an atomic physics model that yields a number @xmath58 1 can be ruled out at a confidence level _",
    "p = 1 - n _ ; conversely , a model with a baryonic mass estimate that yields @xmath59 1 is consistent with the cosmological constraint given by equation ( 15 ) and remains a viable model candidate .",
    "+ the confidence with which models can be ruled out on this basis is plotted as a function of the minimum baryonic mass estimated by the model ( solid curve in figure 3 ) . to check the consistency of the four lvg models considered in",
    " 3 with these results , dashed lines representing the masses derived from each model are included in the plot ( upper left panel ) . assuming the co and [ cii ] molecules are uniformly mixed in virialized clouds results in a baryonic mass m@xmath60 = 3.56@xmath6110@xmath62 m@xmath8 .",
    "such a source , with a corresponding halo mass m@xmath63 1.9@xmath6110@xmath13 m@xmath8 , is expected to be observed 4% of the time ; this model can thus be ruled out at the @xmath64 level ( dotted ) .",
    "the models which postulate separate virialized regions ( dash - dot ) and mixed unvirialized regions ( solid ) can be ruled out with relatively less certainty , at the @xmath65 and @xmath66 levels , respectively . on the other hand , modeling the co and [ cii ] emission lines as originating from separate , unvirialized regions ( dashed ) , as was done by @xcite , results in a minimum baryonic mass which is consistent with the constraint posed by equation ( 15 ) . in this case , m@xmath60 = 2.54@xmath6110@xmath67 m@xmath8 , and we expect to find @xmath68 1 halos with a halo mass m@xmath63 5.4@xmath6110@xmath62 m@xmath8 at a redshift z @xmath56 5",
    ". + these baryonic masses , obtained via the lvg method , represent conservative estimates of the total baryonic content associated with hdf 850.1 .",
    "in particular , mass contributions from any ionized gas or stars residing in the galaxy are not taken into account , and in the models where a layered cloud structure is assumed , the atomic hydrogen mass component is left undetermined .",
    "we therefore consider the effects on the predicted number of observed halos , _",
    "n(m@xmath57 ) _ , if the minimum baryonic mass derived for each model is doubled .",
    "using these more accurate estimates of hdf 850.1 s baryonic mass , we find that the two models in which the virialization condition is enforced can be ruled out at the @xmath69 level ( upper right panel ) . + for comparison , we also consider the gas masses implied by the co(1 - 0 ) line luminosities predicted by the two models where distinct co and c@xmath2 layers are assumed ( lower left panel ) .",
    "adopting a co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factor of @xmath0 = 0.8 ( k km s@xmath5 pc@xmath11)@xmath5 , we find that enforcing the cosmological constraint posed by the abundance of dark matter halos does not rule out either model , even if the minimum baryonic masses are doubled to account for neglected contributions to the total gas mass ( lower right panel ) . if a conversion factor of @xmath0 = 4.6 ( k km s@xmath5 pc@xmath11)@xmath5 is used , both models can be ruled out at the @xmath6 1@xmath10 level and increasing these obtained masses by a factor of two drives up the sigma levels to @xmath70 for both models .",
    "in this paper , we employed the lvg method to explore alternate model configurations for the co and c@xmath2 emission lines regions in the high - redshift source hdf 850.1 .",
    "in particular , we considered emissions originating from _",
    "( i ) _ separate unvirialized regions , _ ( ii ) _ separate virialized regions , _ ( iii ) _ uniformly mixed unvirialized regions , and _",
    "( iv ) _ uniformly mixed virialized regions .",
    "the set of lvg parameters , \\{_t@xmath71 , n@xmath72 , dv / dr , @xmath73 , n@xmath72 _ } , were fit to reproduce the observed line ratios and the resulting column density was then used to calculate the molecular gas mass , m@xmath72 , in each case . in the models where",
    "the co molecules and c@xmath2 ions were assumed to be uniformly mixed , two additional parameters , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , were fit as well , resulting in both a molecular and an atomic hydrogen gas mass .",
    "the gas masses derived by employing the lvg technique thus represent conservative estimates of the minimum baryonic mass associated with hdf 850.1 . + these estimates",
    "were then used , together with the sheth - tormen mass function for dark matter halos to calculate the number of halos with mass m@xmath76 m@xmath60 that each model predicts to find within the hdf survey volume .",
    "given that at least one such source has been detected , we found that models _",
    "( ii ) _ , _ ( iii ) _ , and _",
    "( iv ) _ can be ruled out at the 1.6@xmath10 , 0.5@xmath10 , and 2.0@xmath10 levels respectively .",
    "the confidence with which these models are ruled out is significantly increased if a less conservative estimate of the baryonic mass is taken ; increasing the lvg - modeled gas masses by a factor of two to account for neglected contributions to the total baryonic mass , drives up these sigma levels to 2.4@xmath10 , 1.6@xmath10 , and 2.8@xmath10 respectively .",
    "we are therefore led to the conclusion that hdf 850.1 is modeled best by a collection of unvirialized molecular clouds with distinct co and c@xmath2 layers , as in pdr models .",
    "the lvg calculations for this model yield a kinetic temperature of 85 k , a velocity gradient of 5.0 km s@xmath5 pc@xmath5 , a molecular hydrogen density of 10@xmath77 @xmath78 , a co to h@xmath79 abundance ratio of 10@xmath80 , and a column density of 5.1@xmath6110@xmath81 @xmath82 .",
    "the corresponding molecular gas mass obtained using this lvg approach is m@xmath83 2.54@xmath6110@xmath67 m@xmath8 . for this preferred model",
    "we find that the co - to - h@xmath1 luminosity to mass ratio is @xmath0 = 0.6 ( k km s@xmath5 pc@xmath11)@xmath5 , close to the value found for ulirgs in the local universe .",
