    "boson stars ( bss ) are localized , regular , spherically symmetric solutions of einstein s field equations , whose matter content is provided by a complex scalar field with mass and self - interaction @xcite .",
    "recently boson stars have appeared in many contexts .",
    "traditionally they were proposed to be alternatives of compact objects @xcite ; they have been proposed as candidates for dark matter @xcite ; this includes the possibility to emulate galactic supermassive black holes @xcite ; they have even been considered as sources of gravitational waves @xcite ; and they have been used in the field of numerical relativity to test evolution formulations of einstein s equations and experience with gauge conditions @xcite , since these objects are very tractable in the sense that they have no defined surface and their dynamics do not tend to form shocks , and therefore sophisticated techniques -like shock capturing methods- are not required .",
    "moreover , bss define sequences of equilibrium configurations which serve to test a numerical implementation .",
    "that is , for a spherical equilibrium configuration the field has to oscillate with a constant frequency while the geometry of the space - time has to remain static . for general reviews in bss",
    "see @xcite . in this paper",
    "i focus on numerical challenges , and set up a starting point to study the astrophysical applications mentioned before . instead of developing the original mean field approximation to calculate the expectation value of the stress - energy tensor components of a quantum scalar field as done originally @xcite , the field",
    "is simply considered to be classical as usually done when studying the evolution of these systems .",
    "+ for several reasons , such systems have only been evolved for long times ( long enough to observe the oscillations of a perturbed star ) in spherical symmetry using 1d codes @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this is without doubt the difficulty in formulating the evolution equations for the space - time from einstein s equations when using non - spherical symmetry . in spherical symmetry",
    "these evolution equations are replaced with the slicing condition and the constraints ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting odes can be integrated at each time step during the evolution , which is computationally cheap and allows a constrained evolution under control for very long periods of time .",
    "other problem in higher dimensions is the difficulty to achieve the same resolutions used in 1d simulations due to the lack of computational resources , since the memory requirements in 3d unigrids forces one to sacrifice either the size of the physical domain or the numerical resolution in regions where the gravitational field still strong .",
    "moreover , the number of variables in higher dimensions is also bigger than in 1d .",
    "+ the practical concern is that in 3d the constraint equations are elliptic , which one does not want to solve at every time step due to the extreme hardware requirements needed to carry out a significantly long simulation . therefore it is usually preferable to use unconstrained gauges and evaluate the constraints just to monitor the accuracy and convergence of the solution one is calculating .",
    "even though unconstrained evolutions of einstein s equations are still under study , it is known that some formulations work better than others when using certain gauge conditions . in this paper the bssn formulation of general relativity is considered @xcite , which has shown to be more stable for longer evolutions than the adm formulation for a number of physical systems @xcite and presents different stability properties @xcite ( for test beds and comparisons under different gauges see @xcite ) .",
    "+ the lagrangian density from which the einstein and klein - gordon equations describing bss are derived reads :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the ricci scalar , @xmath2 is a complex scalar field minimally coupled to gravity , @xmath3 is its complex conjugate and @xmath4 the potential of self - interaction of the field .",

    "a zero shift is used for stable equilibrium configurations , and a simple but sophisticated driver involving a non - zero shift will prove to be necessary in order to follow the evolution of unstable configurations .",
    "the general form of the potential to be studied here is @xmath14 the numerical techniques used in the simulations shown are described . in section [ sec : stests ] physical tests are presented and a set of production runs from which the frequencies of the oscillation modes found in 1d for several configurations are reproduced with the present 3d code . in section [ sec : utests ] an example of various unstable bss is shown .",
    "a trick to excite non - radial modes is presented in section [ sec : radiation ] through the manipulation of the refinement of the grid in different directions .",
    "section [ sec : restrictions ] refers to the restrictions of the present code .",
    "finally , some comments are addressed in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the scalar field is described by its real and imaginary parts , such that @xmath15 .",
    "i define four new real variables based on combinations of derivatives of the scalar field as follows : @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for @xmath18 , where @xmath11 is still the lapse function of the space - time and @xmath19 is the determinant of the three metric @xmath13 . in terms of these new variables",
    "the kg equation ( [ kg ] ) can be rewritten as a set of first order evolution equations :    @xmath20    where the summation convention is assumed over latin indices . evidently the set ( [ kg1]-[kg4 ] ) is a system of evolution equations that provides the derivatives of the scalar field at each time slice , from which it is possible to reconstruct the scalar field itself using the definition of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "when solving the kg system above , it is necessary to solve the evolution einstein s equations in the bssn formulation as described in reference @xcite .",
    "basically the bssn formulation uses the evolution variables : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , instead of the usual adm variables @xmath13 and @xmath28 .",
    "the evolution equations for the new variables are described in a number of references , e.g. @xcite .",
    "+ the integration of the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg1]-[kg4 ] ) and the bssn variables is performed using the method of lines with second order centered differencing in space . for the time integration a third order runge - kutta ( rk3 ) algorithm",
    "is used @xcite .",
    "+      in the case of stable equilibrium configurations the evolution of the gauge was carried out using zero shift and the @xmath29 slicing condition @xcite , which is a particular method according to which the lapse evolves as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature and @xmath32 ( @xmath33=0 in the present case ) . due to the time independence of the metric one",
    "knows _ a priori _ that @xmath34 , i.e. that @xmath31 has to be zero for equilibrium configurations of boson stars .",
    "however this is only valid in the continuum limit . in practice ,",
    "the discretized version of the equations will prevent the extrinsic curvature from being exactly zero .",
    "nevertheless it was observed that the components of the extrinsic curvature converged to such value .",
    "+ in order to evolve unstable equilibrium configurations the @xmath29 slicing condition was also used , but it was necessary an additional hyperbolic gamma - driver shift condition @xcite .",
    "this type of conditions are necessary after a black hole has formed and prevent the grid stretching effect followed by an unphysical growth of the horizon .",
    "as described in @xcite , such gamma - drivers are diverse , but for the spherically symmetric case i deal with here , the following hyperbolic condition was used :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are coefficients controlling the gauge speeds and certain damping added to the shift respectively .",
    "a modified version of radiative boundary conditions is applied to the bssn variables and to the defined first order variables @xmath2 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "for all these variables it is assumed that they behave as a constant plus an outgoing radial wave at the boundaries , plus an extra term that helps to control initial transient effects , that is    @xmath40    where @xmath41 , @xmath42 is one for the lapse and the diagonal components of the three metric and zero otherwise , @xmath43 is a function of @xmath44 and @xmath45 an unknown power .",
    "the reason to choose the outgoing radial wave boundary condition is that it has proved to be very efficient at absorbing waves .",
    "the differential equation in cartesian coordinates corresponding to the expression above is    @xmath46    for a given @xmath45 , the unknown function @xmath47 can be evaluated at a point away from the boundary , and substituted in the previous equations to evaluate any dynamical variable at the boundary @xcite .",
    "it was found that when the potential of the scalar field has zero self - interaction ( @xmath48 ) , then switching off the extra term ( @xmath49 ) , that is , using standard radiative boundary conditions , the evolution behaves properly . nevertheless ,",
    "when the self - interaction is non zero , it was found that a bigger power ( @xmath50 or @xmath51 ) prevents a pulse on the field variables coming from the boundaries .",
    "it is worth mentioning that instead of using a sponge as used in spherically symmetric evolutions with @xmath52 @xcite , the modifications mentioned here sufficed to evolve the shown systems with second order accuracy for a number of crossing times .",
    "finally it is important to stress that in the case of spherical symmetry these bcs are appropriate .",
    "more care is required when systems with other symmetries are studied , since this approximation is only valid if one considers that the front signals propagating outwards are spherical .",
    "+      after an apparent horizon has been found for the first time , a lego sphere ( the set of points of a cubic grid contained inside a 2-sphere ) is excised from its interior .",
    "excising is a common practice when evolving black hole space - times @xcite and has shown to be an essential strategy when evolving matter fields as shown recently in @xcite ; the main aim of using excision is that the code is not forced to calculate quantities in a region close to a singularity , where gradients are expected to be inaccurate . in the present case one expects the matter field to fall into the resulting horizon in a finite time , thus the excision region is allowed to resize according to the size and shape of the apparent horizon . for this purpose the apparent horizon finder in @xcite was used every time step .",
    "a buffer zone of five points between the excision region and the apparent horizon is kept .",
    "+ the interior boundary is the set of points delimiting the excision region .",
    "as apparent horizons lie inside event horizons , all the signals propagate towards the excision region and so do the errors .",
    "this is the reason why the time derivative of all the evolved variables is set to be zero at the the inner boundary .",
    "the implementation consists of calculating the time derivatives of the variables one point away from the excision region in the direction determined by the normal ; this time derivative is then used to evolve the variable on the excision boundary . +",
    "in order to test the evolution code , the first important issue is setting up initial data that work in 1d .",
    "for this , the well studied case of spherically symmetric equilibrium configurations is chosen , where the scalar field oscillates with constant frequency whereas the geometry in the chosen gauge remains time - independent .",
    "einstein s equations are solved on a spherically symmetric background by assuming that the space time is static and that the scalar field has the form @xmath53 , so that all the components of the stress - energy tensor are time - independent . assuming @xmath54 one arrives at the equations    @xmath55\\label{sphericalekg}\\\\ \\frac{\\alpha'}{\\alpha } & = & \\frac{a^2 - 1}{r } + \\frac{a'}{a } -   \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa r a^2 v\\nonumber\\\\ \\varphi '' & + & \\varphi ' \\left ( \\frac{2}{r } + \\frac{\\alpha ' } { \\alpha } -   \\frac{a'}{a}\\right ) + \\omega^2\\varphi \\frac{a^2}{\\alpha^2 } -   a^2 \\frac{dv}{d|\\varphi|^2 } \\varphi = 0\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which is a set of coupled ordinary differential equations to be solved under the conditions @xmath56 , @xmath57 finite and @xmath58 in order to guarantee regularity and spatial flatness at the origin , and @xmath59 in order to ensure asymptotic flatness at infinity as described in @xcite . here",
    "the solution was calculated using the standard rescaled variables @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 so that the coordinate time is given in units of @xmath66 and the distance in units of @xmath67 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eq_sequences ] the sequence of equilibrium configurations corresponding to different self - interaction values is shown , and will serve to illustrate the functionality of this 3d code .",
    "+     the sequences of equilibrium configurations are shown for different values of the self - interaction coefficient @xmath68 .",
    "the configurations to the left of the respective peaks are stable configurations , and those to the right are unstable , which means that either they could collapse to form black holes or disperse away under infinitesimal perturbations , depending on the sign of the binding energy ( see below ) .",
    "the triangles down , the stars and the circles correspond to the configurations evolved to trace the radial modes of oscillation of stable configurations .",
    "the filled squares represent four particular cases studied in depth to show the capabilities of the numerical techniques.,width=302 ]    once the system ( [ sphericalekg ] ) has been solved with sufficiently high resolution , the straightforward identification of the 1d variables with the 3d variables at initial time is as follows : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this can be easily understood just by recalling the _ ansatz _ @xmath75 in rescaled units .",
    "then the 3d cartesian grid is populated by copying the values of such variables to the nearest neighbor grid points of the 3d domain , and applying the coordinate transformation from spherical to cartesian coordinates .",
    "since it is known _ a priori _ that the space time should be time - independent i set the components of the extrinsic curvature to zero initially .",
    "then the unconstrained evolution is started and the geometry and the field evolve according to their corresponding equations . +      the convergence of a non vacuum system is a major issue for many reasons .",
    "the usually applied boundary conditions to the geometrical quantities correspond to outgoing waves and moreover the boundary conditions for the scalar field with a potential term have no reported solution up to now for a 3d grid , so that the boundary conditions are not necessarily consistent with the evolution equations ; these difficulties are not particular to the present problem , but are also a concern when solving the vacuum einstein s equations or relativistic hydrodynamical fields , because these conditions could allow constraint violating modes to come into the domain and destroy the simulations .",
    "nevertheless it was found that the modified sommerfeld boundary conditions mentioned in the previous section , work well for the variables describing the field and the geometric quantities at once for quite a long time . in fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] it is shown the convergence of the @xmath76 norm of the violation of the hamiltonian constraint produced for two initial configurations .",
    "second order convergence is manifest indicating the accurate and stable behavior of the simulations for dozens of crossing times .",

    "the resolutions used were @xmath78 for the @xmath79 box and @xmath80 for the @xmath81 box in each of the configurations.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    one intriguing issue has to do with the time independence of the metric , which actually oscillates around or close to a certain fixed shape .",
    "in fact , due to the considerable amplitude of such oscillations it is possible to imagine that probably the evolved configuration corresponds to another configuration with different properties than those of the initial data . in fig . [",
    "fig : t_independence ] two different cases that are representative are shown : in the first case , the maximum of the metric function @xmath82 oscillates around the right value calculated with the 1d code , which is assumed to be the correct value ; in the second case the maximum of the metric component oscillates , but not around the expected value , instead with smaller values all the way .",
    "the fact is that in both cases the oscillating values of @xmath83 converge to a constant value that coincides with the one calculated at initial time .",
    "the second order convergence of this quantity indicates that the desired configuration is the one being evolved .",
    "+              with high spatial resolution it is quite easy to obtain very small variations of the metric functions in time , but since one is dealing with a coarse 3d grid the situation is slightly different .",
    "instead , due to the errors introduced when populating the 3d grid with the initial data and those due to the discretization , one is dealing with perturbed configurations and thus it is possible to see only how the geometry converges to a fixed one when the spatial resolution is increased .",
    "nevertheless i take advantage of this fact now to study oscillating radial modes as done in @xcite , but in the present case using the 3d code .",
    "+ when studying the 1d problem with very refined grids it was necessary to set up an explicit perturbation by adding particles or kinetic energy to the initial equilibrium configuration in order to study the oscillations of the space time @xcite . taking advantage of having a coarse grid , one gets for free the errors introduced when setting up the initial data , plus the discretization errors due to the numerical methods , act as a spherical perturbation , since an equally spaced grid is used in all directions , so that the evolution starts with perturbed configurations that converge to a strict equilibrium configuration , and it is possible to follow the oscillations of the metric functions . an indication that the perturbations applied are spherical consists in showing the amplitude of the zerilli function extracted from the evolutions for the case of an unequally spaced grid in the @xmath84-direction as shown below . + in fig .",
    "[ fig : qqmodes ] appear the results found for equilibrium configurations evolved for three different values of self - interaction .",
    "each point represents a run on a * @xmath79 * ( the coarse grid here ) in octant mode of one of the equilibrium configurations indicated in fig  [ fig : eq_sequences ] , which was run up to @xmath85 in coordinate time and stopped because of two factors : a ) even if the evolution algorithm used is less dissipative than the usual second order ones , dissipation starts being noticed and b ) the phase of the scalar field also starts to be shifted and begins to be less good .",

    "the curves shown in fig .  [ fig : qqmodes ] mimic those found for these same configurations obtained with a 1d code @xcite .",
    "an important difference between the method used in @xcite and the used here is that in the former case the system was perturbed with a shell of particles falling towards the star , and in the present case the discretization error is used as the perturbation . in the first situation the metric functions oscillate with an amplitude that approaches exponentially towards their values corresponding to the unperturbed configuration , and in the present case no extra particles",
    "are added , which implies that there is no extra matter to be ejected , and no exponential decay of the amplitude of the oscillations is expected , instead , the discretization error is present over all the numerical domain at every time . +     the frequencies of oscillation of max(@xmath82 ) for several equilibrium configurations is shown .",
    "it was found to be in very good agreement with those plots found with a 1d code for the same systems and others in reference @xcite .",
    "here i just present some cases corresponding to certain values of @xmath89.,width=302 ]",
    "unstable boson star configurations are equilibrium configurations characterized by the fact that even using very fine tuned initial data and very high resolution , the finite differencing error in the calculations suffices to make the star collapse or disperse . in order to analyze the physical properties of unstable bss i study in particular the case @xmath90 .",
    "an important feature of the unstable branch of bss is the threshold related to the sign of the binding energy @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the number of particles @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the mass measured by an observer at infinity . if @xmath95 the system is expected to collapse and form a black hole , and otherwise the system is unstable due to the excess of energy translated into kinetic energy , and ( like in a fission process ) it should be dispersed into free particles at infinity @xcite , and this is precisely what is confirmed in these simulations studied here . in @xcite",

    ", it was not possible to confirm is after an expansion ( far away from the 3d box ) the system should have recollapsed to form a black hole , or if a migration to a very dilute configuration ocurred . in any case , it is a coincidence that stars with @xmath97 simply dispersed away , whereas those with @xmath98 simply collapsed without any noticeable ejection of matter . an essential difference to be kept in mind is the nature of the perturbations applied here , where the number of particles is not being modified at all , and the perturbation is applied to the system across the whole numerical domain through discretization error ] .",
    "the limiting situation @xmath99 occurs for the case @xmath100 when @xmath101 .",
    "this threshold splits the unstable branch of equilibrium configurations into two regions : one corresponding to configurations with central field value @xmath98 , i.e. between the critical point @xmath102 separating the stable and the unstable branches and the threshold of zero binding energy @xmath101 ; the fate of the configurations belonging to this region is the formation of a black hole .",

[ fig : circ ] that the ratio of polar to equatorial circumferences is one over the evolution , indicating that the horizons are spherical , despite the lego - type shape of the excision boundary",

    "the configuration corresponds to @xmath90 and @xmath107 .",
    "the gauge parameters and resolution are the same as those used for the collapsing system shown above.,width=302 ]",
    "since the systems presented here have spherical symmetry , no gravitational wave signals are expected .",
    "nevertheless as an exercise and in order to show that the modes studied in section  [ sec : stests ] were actually radial , i take advantage of the freedom one has in 3d to apply a simple trick just by choosing different spatial resolutions @xmath108 with the consequent effect that the system is being perturbed in the @xmath84 direction , and thus gravitational radiation is obtained in the fundamental mode simply due to discretization error .",

    "the period of time that the convergence is preserved acts as an indicator of the consistency properties of the scheme , formulation , and boundary conditions working all together .",
    "the runs were stopped at the times shown in the plots because : a ) the convergence was not manifestly second order with the passage of time , b ) the period of the scalar field drifted after a finite time .",
    "these problems could be sorted out just by using higher resolution in time ; all the simulations were carried out using a cfl factor of @xmath118 ( which means that the runs required tens of thousands of iterations ) , but convergence and period could be preserved just by decreasing such number .",
    "another reason to choose such a small value of the cfl factor was that it helps at diminishing dissipation after a very long time of evolution . +",
    "another issue is the problem of resolution . during the evolutions presented in this manuscript",
    "there were at most a couple of dozens of points ( using the low resolution ) covering the volume containing 95% of the total mass of the star , and twice as much outside such region . in consequence",
    "the gravitational wave detectors had to be placed rather close to the bs .",
    "but even so , the results are good .",
    "the ideal situation for more general configurations would be : high resolution in the central part of the grid and a physical domain big enough to allow one to place detectors far away from the source . thus practically means that the detector would be located in a schwarzschild - like region thus providing cleaner signals .",
    "+ using a uniform grid works fine for spherical symmetry , but presents a dilemma in other cases : use high resolution to cover the central part and then forget about obtaining high quality waveforms , or conversely , sacrifice the resolution at the center and pull the grid far away in order to have a clean gravitational wave signal , but produced by a not accurately evolved source .",
    "the solution to this problem would be provided by the implementation of mesh refinement @xcite , and will be useful when dealing with systems under more interesting symmetries .",
    "+      the phase of the field is an important indicator of the control one has on the simulation , because if the field is out of phase or the period of oscillation of the field are not the right ones , then the effects will be noticed in the geometric quantities . among the experiments carried out , it was observed that when using a three step iterative crank - nicholson ( 3icn ) @xcite or second order runge - kutta ( rk2 ) methods to evolve the system , the period of the scalar field changed after a while ( @xmath119 ) , whereas the third order runge - kutta preserved the phase and the period , although a modified version of icn @xcite proved to work properly as well .",
    "+ the dissipation is another issue one has to deal with when evolving matter . by observing the amplitude of the scalar field",
    "it was found that after @xmath120 the 3icn provided an amplitude of the field @xmath121% less than the original one , while with the rk2 the amplitude of the field it was @xmath122 bigger than the right value for the resolutions used here , which effects were evident in the measurement of physical quantities .",
    "the amplitude of the field after @xmath120 was less than the original by 0.3% using the coarse resolution .",
    "thus , the rk3 was the one providing the most confident results in terms of convergence for longer time , dissipation , phase and period of oscillation of the solutions .",
    "it was also essayed the fourth order runge - kutta scheme , however it required more time iterations and no major improvement in accuracy was found .",
    "rk3 showed to be optimal in performance and accuracy for the purposes of the runs shown here .",
    "+ in the case of stable configurations , the duration time scale of the simulations was enough to observe the oscillations of a wide range of stable configurations .",
    "however , the expected period of oscillation for very diluted configurations ( those to the left in fig .",
    "[ fig : qqmodes ] ) is bigger if the mass is smaller .",
    "therefore , it was not possible to study those configurations within the ranges of evolution times achieved with the present resolution and evolution times at the moment .",
    "+ in the case of unstable configurations it is not expected to observe a constant amplitude of the scalar field , instead the squeezing of the scalar field , which is confined to a small region , implies an increase in the amplitude of the field and energy density whereas it is more concentrated in a small region where nodes can be observed before the formation of an apparent horizon .",
    "after excision is applied , the gradients of the scalar field become important in the region close to the inner boundary , and some unstable modes develop at some point .",
    "we are certain these modes are not numerical artifacts because increasing the resolution they last more time to show up .",
    "i expect to report about this point in further reports .",
    "i have presented a 3d code that is able to keep under control the unconstrained evolution of spherically symmetric boson stars , both stable and unstable using the bssn formulation of general relativity , the @xmath29 slicing condition , a coarse grid and simple discretizations on a uniform grid and well known numerical methods to evolve in time . + stable configurations were evolved during several crossing times with second order convergence of the hamiltonian constraint and some characteristic properties of the geometry , like the convergence of the maximum of the radial metric function to the appropriate value .",
    "the process of collapse of unstable configurations was followed for quite a long time of around @xmath123 , after the bh was formed , with error in the mass of the horizons of less than 0.4% in several cases studied .",
    "the configurations that dispersed where followed for a very long time and no surprises were found when evolving the resulting flat space - time .",
    "+ it has been shown that these evolution techniques work properly when the ivp is not solved in the grid used for the evolution .",
    "this procedure will permit one to distinguish future problems intrinsically related to the solution of the initial value problem directly on the 3d grid @xcite .",
    "i also decided to use simple uniform grids in order to set up test beds for future boson star simulations without involving coordinate transformations @xcite that will be used for further research or mesh refinement that will be helpful as well @xcite . + it is possible to conclude by stating that it has been possible to reproduce in a 3d cartesian grid , the basic results found with 1d codes for spherically symmetric boson stars , which are related to infinitesimal perturbations due to the discretization error . in addition , taking advantage of the freedom one has in 3d grids to choose the discretization error in different directions , it was possible to extract a wave form that illustrates the type of signals one could expect from bss and showed that the signal obtained when exciting the fundamental mode , presents a quick damping as predicted for axial perturbations of boson stars @xcite . + a comment about the late development of a 3d code for boson stars is in turn . under the adm formulation of general relativity @xcite",
    "it was rather difficult to evolve a boson star in 3d for the periods of time shown here ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the main reason preventing such long evolution was the adm formulation itself , which showed to be inefficient at evolving a garden variety of physical systems @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , at the present time one accounts with several new gauge conditions allowing the control of the simulations .",
    "a few years ago considerable effort was invested to evolve boson stars in 3d that did not succeed only because of the formulation used @xcite , although previous studies using new formulations were also explored @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to point out that now it is possible to study in depth the phenomenology of boson stars in full 3d with the new techniques and tools that are emerging in the field of numerical relativity .",
    "boson stars could still be systems helpful at testing new numerical techniques , but most important they can be considered objects whose existence could eventually be probed if they are thought to be sources of gravitational waves .",
    "+ this code was written as a thorn in the cactus frame , and can be plugged into the variety of analysis tools and drivers available in the cactus toolkit @xcite . +    the author thanks horst beyer , peter diener , ian hawke , ed seidel , arturo urea and jason ventrella for important comments and suggestions ; special thanks to ian hawke for implementing the mol thorn , jonathan thornburg for implementing the apparent horizon finder , peter diener for implementing the event horizon finder , and the cactus - team for providing the necessary development tools .",
    "the cactus and cactuseinstein infrastructure with aei thorns were extensively used .",
    "the simulations were carried out in the peyote cluster at the aei and in the supermike cluster at lsu .",
    "this work was supported by the center for computation and technology at lsu .",
