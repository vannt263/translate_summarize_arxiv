    "excitations with fractional quantum numbers in general and neutral excitations with spin1/2 in particular constitute an essential ingredient of many theoretical approaches aimed to explain the non - fermi liquid behavior of quasi - two - dimensional copper oxide materials .",
    "these approaches try to generalize for higher dimensions such mechanisms as spin - charge separation and quantum number fractionalization , the phenomena well understood and adequately described for one - dimensional systems ( see recent review articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .    as a part of the general program to construct a theory of copper oxides ,",
    "there have been many attempts to find neutral spin1/2 excitations ( spinons ) in purely magnetic systems , that is to find higher - dimensional analogues of 1d spin s=1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "such generalization was qualitatively outlined by anderson @xcite in the form of the famous resonant valence bond ( rvb ) state .",
    "this is a _ spin - liquid _ state which breaks neither translational nor spin rotational symmetry .",
    "building on this proposal , kivelson , rokhsar and sethna showed @xcite that such state , if exists , must support neutral spin1/2 excitations .    despite more than a decade of strong efforts , no realization of an rvb state supporting excitations with fractional spin in d @xmath0 1 heisenberg magnets with short - range exchange interactions has been found in models with interactions of the _ heisenberg _ type .",
    "we exclude from the consideration models of _ quantum dimers _ , where such excitations have been shown to exist @xcite , and other recently suggested models with fractionalized excitations , which are not microscopic electronic models ( see , for example @xcite,@xcite ) , as well as generalizations for symmetries higher than su(2 ) .",
    "we also do not consider magnets with _ incommensurate _ ordering ( such as a spiral one ) which also support spin-1/2 excitations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "strong qualitative arguments against the rvb scenario have been presented by read and sachdev @xcite , who argued that the most likely mechanism for disordering an antiferromagnetic state is the _ spin - peierls _ one . here , although spin rotational symmetry is preserved , translational symmetry is broken since the spin system undergoes an explicit dimerization at a finite temperature . that makes the existence of deconfined spinons in the low - temperature phase impossible .",
    "an interesting by - product of the rvb scenario is strong coupling compact quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) field theory .",
    "this gauge theory describes the so - called @xmath1-flux rvb state in the continuum limit@xcite ( see also @xcite,@xcite ) , under the assumption that the system does not develop any spin - peierls ordering .",
    "the gauge theory has infinite bare coupling and therefore is difficult to study .",
    "all existing analysis relies on the results obtained for the su(n ) or sp(2n ) generalizations of this theory based on the 1/n - expansion , as in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe two d - dimensional ( d @xmath0 1 ) models which exhibit neutral spin-1/2 excitations ( spinons ) and apparently represent realizations of the @xmath1-flux rvb state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the models .",
    "they are spatially anisotropic and actually represent collections of weakly coupled chains . in all of these models , the naively strongest interactions between the chains , namely those that couple the antiferromagnetic ( with momentum close to @xmath1 ) fluctuations on neighbouring chains , are frustrated and so can be set to zero in the hamiltonian . in this case , the physics is governed by a _",
    "marginally _ relevant interaction between the long - wavelength magnetic fluctuations . in section 3",
    "we discuss results we managed to obtain for infinite number of chains .",
    "these can be summarized as follows :    * we give a proof of the existence of spin1/2 excitations in the limit of infinite number of chains ; * we demonstrate that in the low - energy limit the effective spin hamiltonian decouples into two commuting parts describing sectors with different parity ; * we show that the models are stable against an antiferromagnetic phase transition ; * for the models in question we demonstrate existence of a zero temperature phase transition ( spontaneous transverse dimerization ) .",
    "* we show that the ground state is degenerate ; for periodic transverse boundary conditions the degeneracy is equal to 2@xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of chains .",
    "to achieve a more detailed understanding of the model , its spectrum and correlation functions , we study some limiting cases . thus in section 4 we discuss two exactly solvable cases : two and four chains with periodic boundary conditions in the transverse direction . in section 5",
    "we consider another solvable case : the model of three chains with open boundary conditions . in all these cases",
    "magnetic excitations carry spin 1/2 , in agreement with the general result .",
    "systems with more than two chains also display non - magnetic ( singlet ) modes and a topological order .",
    "we show that this order is similar to the one which exists in the 1d quantum ising model .",
    "further , in section 5 we introduce a two - dimensional model with a hierarchy of interactions .",
    "we use this , apparently artificial but solvable model as a substitute for the original ( spatially uniform ) one with a hope to extract more detailed information about the structure of the hilbert space .",
    "the hierarchical model is solved by a cluster expansion .",
    "the results indicate that about half of the hilbert space is occupied by singlet modes .",
    "the ground state remains massively degenerate with the ground state entropy proportional to the number of chains .",
    "having in view future numerical simulations for our models , we discuss in section 6 finite  size effects for systems of a finite number of chains . in section 7",
    "we use the acquired knowledge to conjecture the properties of correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 8 .",
    "as in the original suggestion by anderson @xcite , the element most essential for our construction is frustration .",
    "another ingredient of our approach is strong spatial anisotropy : so far we have only been able to deal with models where the exchange interaction in one direction is much greater than in the others .",
    "thus it is proper to describe our models as assemblies of weakly coupled chains .",
    "our results also suggest an alternative approach to strong coupling cqed .",
    "we will not elaborate on this analogy , though , postponing this interesting question for future studies .",
    "the first model is a spin-1/2 heisenberg magnet on an anisotropic confederate flag ( cf ) lattice . in what follows",
    ", we will be working with a two - dimensional version of this model . the interaction pattern depicted on fig .",
    "1a ; one can easily generalize this construction to three dimensions .",
    "the cf model hamiltonian is given by h_acb = _ j , n\\{j_*s*_j , n _",
    "j+1,n + _ = 1 _ j , n + } , where @xmath4 are spin-1/2 operators , and @xmath5 . since the interchain couplings ( @xmath6 ) are much smaller than the exchange along the chains ( @xmath7 ) it is legitimate to adopt a continuum description of individual chains . in this description ,",
    "the local spin densities are represented as sums of the smooth and staggered parts : _ j , n /a_0 _ n ( x ) = * m*_n(x ) + ( -1)^j*n*_n(x ) ,  x = j a_0 , [ contins ] @xmath8 being the lattice spacing in the chain direction . the low - energy dynamics of the spin1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet h_1d = j__j(*s*_j*s*_j + 1 ) is described by the su@xmath9(2 ) wess - zumino - novikov - witten model .",
    "the latter hamiltonian can be written in terms of the so - called chiral vector _",
    "operators , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , satisfying the level @xmath12 kac - moody algebra ( this approach has been described in a vast number of publications ; see for a review @xcite or @xcite ) : h_1d x+ , [ wznw ] where @xmath13 is the spin velocity and the dots stand for a marginally irrelevant perturbation which will be discarded in what follows .",
    "it is remarkable that the smooth part of magnetization , = * j * + |*j * , [ m ] and the spin current , = v(*j * - |*j * ) , [ j ] are locally expressed in terms of the chiral currents .    in the cf model",
    ", the exchange is frustrated in the direction perpendicular to the chains and can be fine tuned to make its fourier transform vanish at @xmath14 .",
    "this is achieved when the rung and plaquette - diagonal coupling constants satisfy the relation @xmath15 , in which case the direct interchain interaction between staggered magnetizations , @xmath16 , is completely eliminated .",
    "the absence of this , strongly relevant perturbation is the most important property of our model .",
    "the triangular lattice is excluded from the consideration .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that the coupling of the staggered parts of magnetization can not be removed completely in that case : parity - breaking ( `` twist '' ) terms surviving the continuum limit make the analysis very complicated .",
    "= 0.65    apart from the collective spin excitations , the second model also involves charge degrees of freedom .",
    "it is a quasi - one - dimensional kondo - heisenberg model ( see fig.1b ) which has been already discussed in the context of theory of stripes @xcite,@xcite ( see also @xcite where the two chain case is discussed ) .",
    "it is assumed that neighboring chains have different band filling such that metallic chains are surrounded by insulating spin-1/2 magnetic chains . in order to eliminate the electron tunneling across the magnetic chain",
    ", one needs to have magnetic stripes consisting of at least three chains . at low energies one can consider such stripe as an effective single spin-1/2 chain . here",
    "the frustration is dynamical : the electrons living on metallic chains do not experience back - scattering on magnetic excitations due to incommensurability of the fermi wave vectors : @xmath17 .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate ( see , for instance @xcite ) that the charge excitations in this model decouple and remain one - dimensional ( this is true at least in the first approximation when one discards various virtual processes ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin sector is described by the same effective hamiltonian as in the cf model .    using the continuum description of individual chains in the interchain exchange interaction , based on the asymptotic representation ( [ contins ] ) of the spin operators , we arrive at the following effective hamiltonian : h = _",
    "n = 1 ^ 2n .[model ] where @xmath18 is given by eq.([wznw ] ) . here",
    "@xmath19 is determined by the lattice hamiltonian ; in the cf model with interactions chosen as in fig .",
    "1a we have @xmath20 . for the kondo - heisenberg model shown in fig.1b , eq.([wznw ] ) is modified in such a way that even ( metallic ) and odd chains ( effective spin-1/2 chains representing a stripe of three coupled heisenberg chains ) have different velocities .",
    "this detail , however , does not lead to any qualitative changes .    the model ( [ model ] ) is closely related to the gauge theories extensively studied in the context of strongly correlated systems .",
    "this analogy is briefly discussed in appendix a. in the rest of this paper , however , we will follow a different route .",
    "namely , we will return to eqs.([wznw ] ) , ( [ model ] ) and employ the abelian bosonization which proves particularly useful in revealing the topological nature of elementary excitations and determining their quantum numbers .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the chiral su@xmath9(2 ) currents can be faithfully represented in terms of holomorphic ( left ) and antiholomorphic ( right ) scalar fields , @xmath21 and @xmath22 : j^3 _",
    "n = _ n ,  & &   j^_n = ^_n[curr - bos1 ] +    @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the ultraviolet cut - off of the bosonic theory , and the fields @xmath21 and @xmath22 are governed by the _",
    "chiral _ gaussian actions @xcite,@xcite ( the latter work used this form of bosonization in the context of the theory of _ edge states _ in quantum hall effect ) .",
    "the bosonized low - energy effective action can then be suitably represented as & & s = _",
    "n = 1^nx   [ l^+ _ n + l^- _",
    "n + l^int _ n ] , [ entire ] + & & l^+ _",
    "n = _ x_2n(_x_2n - v^-1__2n ) + _ x|_2n + 1(_x|_2n + 1 + v^-1_|_2n + 1 ) + + & &  + _",

    "n = l^+ _ n ( |),[bosmodel ] + & & l^int _",
    "n = _ = 1\\{(2)^-2 + _ x_2n_x_2n + } + ( | ) .",
    "this is the form of the action in which the requirement of vanishing charge current ( @xmath25 ) , imposed in the gauge field rvb approach , is explicitly resolved .    according to the definitions ( [ curr - bos1 ] ) , ( [ curr - bos2 ] ) , the total spin projection @xmath26 is equal to s^z = _ n_-^x ( _ x_n + _",
    "[ spinz ] this is a general definition which does not assume that the fields @xmath21 and @xmath22 are independent .",
    "in fact , the interchain interaction that flows to strong coupling in the low - energy limit freezes certain combinations of the fields with opposite chiralities and thus makes them coupled .    in the first loops the renormalization group ( rg ) equations for the model of infinite number of chains coincide with the equations for two chains . at @xmath27",
    "the interaction of currents with different chirality in ( [ action ] ) , ( [ bosmodel ] ) is marginally relevant and reaches the strong coupling at an energy scale = c(v)^1/2(- v/),[scale ] where @xmath28 is a number . at the same time , the ( lorentz - noninvariant ) perturbation @xmath29 , which is responsible for the velocity renormalization , is irrelevant and flows only in the presence of the other interaction .",
    "thus it is likely that this interaction remains weak even when the relevant one reaches the strong coupling .",
    "for this reason , in the situation when the bare constant @xmath30 , we deem it possible to neglect @xmath29 .",
    "this results in an approximate lorentz invariance in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional space - time which plays an important role in the analysis that follows . without @xmath29 ,",
    "the action splits into two independent , chirally asymmetric sectors , @xmath31 .",
    "the two sectors are mapped onto each other under the reversal of the chiralities , @xmath32 , or a shift by one lattice spacing in the transverse direction .",
    "hence the total symmetry becomes [ su(2)]@xmath33[su(2)]@xmath34 and the excitations in this model carry two quantum numbers : spin and parity .",
    "notice that the multi - chain effective action ( [ entire ] ) features a local z@xmath35 symmetry already mentioned for the two - chain problem @xcite : as opposed to the original lattice model which displays global translational invariance , the effective hamiltonian of the continuum theory ( [ model ] ) is fully expressed in terms of the vector currents and , therefore , is invariant under _ independent _ translations along the chains by one lattice spacing .",
    "these translations are generated by the shifts _",

    "n ,  |_n |_n .",
    "[ transl2 ] the development of strong - coupling regime in the low - energy limit leads to a spontaneous breakdown of this symmetry . indeed , in the ground state the field combinations @xmath36 get frozen at the values ( see appendix b for the details ) _",

    "[ integers ] the sets of integers @xmath38 subject to the condition ( [ integers ] ) label different degenerate ground states , each of them breaking the local translational symmetry ( [ transl1 ] ) , ( [ transl2 ] ) .",
    "the existence of stable degenerate minima of the potential implies the existence of massive topological excitations , solitons , interpolating between adjacent vacua . using ( [ spinz ] ) and ( [ vac - fields ] ) one can represent the spin of a given state as s^z = _ n .",
    "[ spinz1 ] thus , the minimal nonzero value of the spin is 1/2 .",
    "this is the spin carried by the topological solitons .",

    "there are solitons and antisolitons with a well defined ( + ) and (  ) parity .",
    "we would like to briefly comment on the above results .",
    "the factor @xmath39 that appears in the arguments of the cosines in eqs.([action ] ) , ( [ bosmodel ] ) , representing a marginal current - current interchain interaction , is crucial . recalling the bosonization rules for the staggered magnetization of a single spin-1/2 chain ( see e.g. @xcite ) _",

    "however , by construction these terms do not appear in our models , and this is why the interchain interactions do not lead to spinon confinement .",
    "this argument does not require neglecting @xmath41 because the latter term also contains only @xmath39 cosines .",
    "thus we are confident that in the models in question spin-1/2 excitations do exist .",
    "we also may rest assured that these excitations do not remain confined to individual chains , as it happens , for instance in the so - called sliding luttinger liquid phase in arrays of crossed chains @xcite , @xcite . in that latter case , the spinons survive due to irrelevance of the interchain interactions .",
    "contrary to that scenario , in our case the interchain coulings remain relevant making the system truly multi - dimensional .",
    "the following calculation suggests that freezing of the fields does not imply that one can expand around the vacuum configurations .",
    "naively , one would adopt a self - consistent harmonic approximation ( scha ) in which the cosine term is expanded around the minimum : + ^2 . here",
    "@xmath42 denotes a deviation from the vacuum value .",
    "scha assumes that the transverse stiffness @xmath43 should be determined self - consistently : = .",
    "[ sf ] we shall demonstrate , however , that such procedure yields zero @xmath43 .",
    "the effective action for fluctuations around the minima is ( here we set @xmath44 ) s = _ p(^ * _ p , ^ * _ p ) (    cc q(q + ) + , & k + k , & q(q - ) +    ) (    c _ p + _ p    ) , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 being the longitudinal and transverse momenta , respectively . self - consistency condition ( [ sf ] ) becomes ~ & & - [ g _ + g _",

    "its failure originates from the chiral structure of the gaussian part of action ( [ action ] ) which includes the first power of the time gradient . for the conventional ( non - chiral ) gaussian model a similar solution would be self - consistent .",
    "one immediate consequence of it would be the appearance of an average staggered magnetization .",
    "thus the present calculation demonstrates _ stability against antifferomagnetism_.      as we have already seen , the fact that the combinations of the fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 get locked at @xmath51 , @xmath52 implies that the ground state of the system is characterized by a spontaneously broken local translational invariance ( [ transl1 ] ) , ( [ transl2 ] ) .",
    "the _ most obvious _ order parameters ( op ) in the two sectors of the model ( [ entire ] ) , whose structure directly follows from the form of the interaction , are given by & & t_^(+ ) = , + & & t_^(- ) = [ op ] the above ops are real ( see eq.([vac - fields ] ) ) , defined on the links of the lattice and are non - local in terms of original spins .",
    "moreover , since the ops include chiral fields , they are expressed ( nonlocally ! ) in terms of magnetization density and _ spin currents_. as is shown in appendix b , for different pairs of neighboring chains , the signs of the order parameters are uncorrelated .",
    "this leads to a massive gound state degeneracy 2@xmath2 ( recall that @xmath3 is the total number of chains ) .",
    "the non - locality of the order parameter suggests a possibility of _ topological _ order .",
    "this supports the original idea by wiegmann that topological order exists in rvb states @xcite,@xcite .",
    "characteristic features of such order is non - locality of the order parameter , ground state degeneracy ( in a closed system ) and the existence of edge states ( in an open system ) .",
    "the ground state degeneracy depends on the topology of the manifold ( hence the name topological ) .",
    "a relative stability of the state with respect to perturbations is protected by the spectral gap .",
    "one well known example of topologically ordered states is provided by incompressible fractional quantum hall states ( see the discussion in @xcite and references therein ) . in our case",
    "the degeneracy of the ground state is exponential in the number of chains .",
    "this fact alone indicates that these models have a topological order of a different type .",
    "this order is closely related to the one existing in 2d ising model , multi - channel kondo models and models with scattering matrices of the rsos - type .",
    "the first examples of non - local order parameters are given by the disorder field of 2d ising model @xcite and the dual field exponentials in 2d xy model@xcite,@xcite .",
    "these fields acquire non - zero expectation values in disordered phases of the corresponding models . according to @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite ,",
    "such order parameters ( also called string order parameters ) exist in various massive phases of 1d spin liquids .",
    "all these liquids are related to either spin s=1 heisenberg chain or two - leg spin 1/2 heisenberg ladders . as was demonstrated in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , after the wick rotation these systems can be described as a collection of 2d ising models .",
    "the evidence that the order is really topological was presented by affleck @xcite , who proved that 1d spin liquids have edge , or rather end , states : open chains have free spin-1/2 states located at the chain s ends .",
    "we postpone a more detailed discussion of the issue of topological nature of the order till the further sections .",
    "order parameters ( [ op ] ) change their sign on soliton configurations and , therefore , vanish at finite temperatures when the densities of solitons and antisolitons are finite and _",
    "equal_. this mechanism is a sufficient ( though not a necessary ) one to destroy the order parameter at finite @xmath53 .",
    "the sign changes may also originate from fluctuations in non - magnetic channels .",
    "later we will discuss an exactly solvable example of four coupled chains in which the latter scenario is realized .",
    "the temperature dependence of the correlation length depends on what mechanism is realized .",
    "if the order parameter is destroyed only by ( anti)solitons , the correlation length is exponentially large in @xmath54 .",
    "this is because the topological excitations have a finite spectral gap and therefore their density is exponentially small : @xmath55 . in this case , the correlation length is defined as the average spacing between the solitons : @xmath56 ( @xmath57 is the space dimensionality ) .",
    "as we shall see , the singlet excitations either have a very small gap or even no gap at all ( we do not know whether the latter is true ) .",
    "then the order parameter is governed by another correlation length quite distinct from the above .",
    "the density of non - magnetic excitations above their gap depends on @xmath53 as a power law .",
    "such situation would correspond to a quantum critical point with a power law correlation length .    turning to physical fields",

    "notice that both @xmath67-dependence of @xmath68 and the very existence of @xmath57 are effects exponential in @xmath188 .",

    "let us make a summary of our results .",
    "* we have found models of magnets with a short range heisenberg exchange which have neither magnetic nor spin - peierls order .",
    "* we have given a formal prove that these models possess excitations with spin 1/2 .",
    "* we established the existence of @xmath98 critical point and a massive ground state degeneracy .",
    "the ground state entropy is proportional to the number of chains .",
    "* we have also established that the low - energy hamiltonian separates into two weakly interacting parts describing sectors with different parity .",
    "* we established that the correlation functions of staggered magnetizations can be written as real space products of correlation functions of non - local operators belonging to the sectors with different parity ( see eqs.([factor1 ] , [ factor2 ] ) ) .",
    "* we have solved the problem exactly for the case of two and four coupled chains ( the latter one with periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "the results are consistent with the statements made for the case of infinite number of chains .",
    "the spectrum contains a massive amount of singlet excitations . in the language of gauge theory",
    "these excitations describe dynamics of wilson loops .",
    "a natural question is whether the models considered in our work can be realized .",
    "we believe that the the answer is positive .",
    "the model of stripes may well be relevant in a strongly underdoped regime of copper oxides .",
    "we have already mentioned in introduction , that there are other models of fractionalization , such as suggested in @xcite,@xcite together with the corresponding dimer models mentioned earlier . though these works use hamiltonians not based on any microscopic electron models",
    ", one might hope that they capture some features of the solution .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to study in detail how singlet excitations , which in our model are associated with the o(3 ) gn models emerging on each triad of chains , are related to z@xmath35 vortices ( visons ) introduced in @xcite,@xcite(see also the recent work @xcite , which essentially clarifies the concept of vison ) .",

    "the relationship with the gauge theories can be inferred from the fact that the level @xmath192 su(2 ) kac - moody currents can be identified with ( iso)spin currents of massless dirac fermions : j^a = r^+_^a_r _ ,   |j^a = l^+_^a_l _ , @xmath101 being pauli matrices .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ wznw]),([model ] ) becomes h = _ nx[fermions ] as gauge theories of the rvb state , this theory possesses redundant charge degrees of freedom which do not participate in the interactions .",
    "since every approximation violates this subtle property , dealing with the charge sector would become the same awkward problem as it is in the standard approach to the rvb gauge theory , once one decides to adopt this fermionic representation .",
    "let us , however , follow the well - trodden path for a while just to make sure that the model we are discussing does fall in the category of rvb liquids . to this end",
    ", we use the identity @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the permutation operator , and apply the hubbard - stratonovich transformation to rewrite the interaction term in eq.([fermions ] ) as _ , nx + ... where the dots stand for the terms we deem irrelevant .",
    "the procedure essentially coincides with the conventional decoupling scheme in the rvb approach .",
    "the fact that such decoupling here is done only in one lattice direction is not important provided one can justify that fluctuations of @xmath195 may be neglected . as we shall see , excitations associated with breaking of singlets carry the largest spectral gap .",
    "this justifies the assumption about small fluctuations of @xmath195 .",
    "once the amplitude @xmath196 is frozen , one is left with the compact u(1 ) lattice gauge theory in the strong coupling limit ( indeed , the gauge field has no bare @xmath197-term which corresponds to infinite bare charge . ) .",
    "the vector potential @xmath198 is represented by the phase of @xmath199 . since by omitting the term with @xmath200 we violate the decoupling of the charge degrees of freedom , we have to enforce the constraint on the absence of charge fluctuations by introducing the time component @xmath201 of the gauge field . in the mean field approximation ( that is , when fluctuations of the gauge fields are neglected ) we obtain the spectrum of the @xmath1-flux state @xcite : e(p ) = [ mf ] which has two dirac - like conical singularities in the brillouin zone . from what we have done in this paper",
