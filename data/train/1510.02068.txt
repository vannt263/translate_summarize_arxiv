    "one of the most controversial problems in physics is the cosmological constant problem ( ccp ) .",
    "the natural value predicted for the cosmological constant by particle physics is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the planck scale , which has a great discrepancy with the observational bound , @xmath5 ( about 120 orders of magnitude ) @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric theories put a lower bound for the cosmological constant which is about @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , the supersymmetry breaking scale , yet has a difference of about @xmath8 orders of magnitude . this discrepancy between the expected and observed value of cosmological",
    "constant remains as an unanswered question @xcite .",
    "many attempts have been done to give an acceptable and relevant answer to this problem in the context of general relativity , while some authors were seeking through the anthropic principle @xcite .",
    "a different aperture arose when it was shown that the cosmological constant became zero as a result of a unbroken supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , many attempts done in the context of supergravity @xcite and superstring @xcite , yet there is no mechanism known to have an effective cosmological constant which is of the same order of the observational limit and particularly is unaffected from the quantum fluctuation . on the other hand , the discovery of the cosmic acceleration , directed the study of cosmological constant in another point of view .",
    "the positive cosmological constant was demanded by observations including the more detailed studies of supernovae @xcite , large - scale structure , and the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "recently , the released planck data combined with other astrophysical data , including type ia supernovae , constrained the equation of state of dark energy to @xmath9 , which is well consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant @xcite .    meanwhile",
    ", the braneworld scenarios present a solution to the unsolved problems in gravity and cosmology , such as dark energy .",
    "in addition , it brought new methods for having a vanishing cosmological constant on the brane @xcite , but non could provide a convincing and robust justification .",
    "so there is not a general solution to explain why it is non - zero and yet it is so small . in the herein paper ,",
    "we focus our attempts on the approach introduced in @xcite and try to address this problem . in that paper , a covariant or a model",
    "independent einstein s equations of a brane world model embedded isometrically and locally in a ambient space with arbitrary number of dimensions are derived .",
    "therein , the use of nash s theorem for the perturbation of the submanifold lets the brane to have a thickness . in brane models with one non - compact extra dimension ,",
    "the extrinsic curvature is defined by using the junction condition .",
    "but , in the case of multiple extra dimensions , the junction condition is not applicable . then additional assumptions are needed to specify the extrinsic curvature .",
    "it was shown that , the induced gravitational constant , @xmath10 , depended on the local normal radii of the freidmann - lamatre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) submanifold , an arbitrary function of the cosmic time @xcite . in this paper , to be able to solve the resulting field equations , we will use a simple phenomenological power law form of @xmath11 in terms of scale factor .",
    "consequently the induced extrinsic term on the field equations of brane is of cosmological constant type .",
    "we will show that the observed cosmological constant is a gravitational - geometrical constant , and it is not related to the vacuum energy .",
    "following our previous work @xcite , consider the @xmath12-dimensional minkowskian ambient space @xmath13 with local natural cartesian coordinates @xmath14 , endowed with a metric @xmath15 with signature @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , consider in @xmath17 a @xmath18 lorentzian submanifold @xmath19 with adapted local coordinates @xmath20 and induced metric @xmath21 .",
    "we can then construct an adopted coordinate system in the ambient space which includes the local coordinates of submanifold @xmath22 as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are extrinsic or extra coordinates .",
    "in such a condition , the submanifold @xmath22 is defined by @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the isometric local embedding is given by @xmath12 differential maps @xmath26 also , the vectors @xmath27 form a basis of tangent and normal vector spaces respectively at each point of @xmath22 , where @xmath28 denotes the components of @xmath29 unit vector fields orthogonal to the @xmath22 and also normal to each other in direction of the extra coordinates @xmath30 .",
    "consequently , differential map @xmath31 satisfies embedding equations and large latin indices run from 0 to @xmath32 .",
    "units so that @xmath33 are used throughout this work . also , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . ]",
    "@xmath37 then the projected gradients of bases vectors can be decomposed with respect to the bases vectors @xmath38 which are the generalizations of well - known gauss - weingarten equations @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the connection coefficients compatible with induced metric , @xmath41 denotes extrinsic curvature and @xmath42 is the extrinsic twist potential ( or third fundamental form ) defined by @xmath43 . to introduce a brane with constant thickness @xmath44 , according to the nash - morse implicit function theorem @xcite , the submanifold @xmath19 is deformed so that it remains compatible with confinement . with this method",
    "one can generate a sequences of @xmath18 submanifolds isometrically embedded in ambient space , inside of thickness .",
    "nash s strategy , which is also the strategy of later authors , was to consider the problem of perturbing a given isometric embedding to achieve some desired and suitably small change in the metric @xcite .",
    "suppose the local coordinates of perturbed submanifold in the vicinity of original one , @xmath19 , is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes small perturbation parameter .",
    "then , the deformed or perturbed embedding will be @xcite @xmath47 the line element of ambient space in the vicinity of submanifold is @xmath48 . by substituting perturbed embedding ( [ sh6 ] ) into the expression for the line element , the metric of ambient space in the gaussian coordinates @xmath49 will be @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 this relation guides us to the definition of the curvature radii of the submanifold @xmath19 : the extreme values of normal curvature are calculated by the homogeneous equations @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the curvature radii for each principal direction @xmath55 and for each normal @xmath56 .",
    "hence the normal curvature determines the shape of the submanifold in the neighbourhood of any points .",
    "then the extreme value of the normal curvature is obtained by @xmath57 it follows that the metric of deformed submanifold ( [ sh8 ] ) becomes singular at the solution of equation ( [ 1 - 18 ] ) .",
    "hence , at each point of submanifold , the normal curvature radii generates a closed space @xmath58 ( extrinsic tube ) .",
    "the physical space on the ambient space is bounded to the extrinsic tube as shown in fig .",
    "all extra dimensions are assumed to be spacelike , then @xmath58 may be taken locally to be the @xmath59-sphere @xmath60 with radius @xmath61 , at each point of spacetime @xcite . according to the confinement hypothesis , it is supposed that the standard model particles are localized to a @xmath62-dimensional submanifold , while gravity can freely propagate in the ambient space",
    ". however , due to equation ( [ 1 - 18 ] ) , the normal curvature radii determines a characteristic radius , for the propagation of the gravitons .    generally , by substitution of @xmath63 derived from ( [ sh6 ] ) into the extrinsic curvature of deformed submanifold , defined by @xmath64",
    ", we obtain the extrinsic curvature of deformed submanifold in term of extrinsic curvature of original non - perturbed submanifold as @xmath65 comparing definition of @xmath66 in ( [ sh8 ] ) with ( [ sha1 ] ) we obtain @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the curvature associated with extrinsic twist vector field @xmath42 , defined as @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath42 plays the role of the yang - mills potential @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath42 transform as the component of a gauge vector field under the group of isometries of the bulk if the bulk space ( ambient space ) has certain killing vector fields @xcite and it only exist in the ambient spaces with dimensions equal to or greater than six @xmath70 .",
    "the extrinsic curvature gives a measure of the deviation from the submanifold and its tangent plane at any point .",
    "its symmetric part shows that the second fundamental form propagates in the bulk .",
    "the antisymmetric part is proportional to a yang - mills gauge field , which really can be thought of as a kind of curvature .",
    "is embedded in @xmath12-dimensional ambient space which is bounded by a closed space ( extrinsic tube ) , generated by the normal curvature radii @xmath71 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    now , using expression ( [ sh8 ] ) in einstein - hilbert action functional of abient spacetime and remembering the confinement hypothesis ( matter and gauge fields are confined to the brane with thickness @xmath44 while gravity could propagate in the ambient space up to the curvature radii @xmath71 with the local geometry of @xmath72 ) we obtain @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "hence , the relation between the fundamental scale @xmath75 and the @xmath18 planck scale @xmath76 will be @xmath77 also , with an eye on the lagrangian density of the yang - mills field @xcite @xmath78 the last part of ( [ 1 - 30004 ] ) gives @xmath79 where @xmath80 are the gauge couplings and the index @xmath81 labels the simple subgroups of the gauge group with @xmath82 therefore , the induced action functional is equivalent to the @xmath18 gravitational action containing extrinsic terms and yang - mills action @xmath83 equations ( [ sh11 ] ) and ( [ sh12 ] ) immediately give us the following fundamental relation between normal curvature radii , thickness of the brane , number of extra dimensions and 4d planck s mass @xmath84 in which @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 note that if @xmath87 , the above equation reduces to the equivalent relation in kaluza - klein gravity @xcite . also , from equation ( [ 1,35,0 ] )",
    ", it is easy to see that the following relation is hold between gravitational `` constant '' and gauge couplings @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the gravitational constant and gauge coupling constants at the present epoch , respectively .",
    "then , the induced einstein - yang - mills field equations for the thick brane world model will be @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the @xmath18 einstein tensor and @xmath10 is the induced gravitational constant .",
    "@xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the components of energy - momentum tensor defined such that to be compatible with the confinement hypothesis .",
    "@xmath96 denotes the yang - mills energy - momentum tensor and @xmath97 is a conserved quantity expressed in terms of extrinsic curvature and its trace , @xmath98 , as @xmath99 and @xmath100 , the total covariant derivative , is defined as @xmath101 the resulting field equations provide both the equations of general relativity and of yang - mills .",
    "thus , it introduces a unifying picture like the kaluza - klein theory @xcite .",
    "let us now analyze the influence of the extrinsic curvature terms on a homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "we assume that the flrw spacetime is embedded locally and isometrically in a @xmath102 dimensional minkowskian spacetime . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the twisting vector fields @xmath42 vanish ( charge less universe ) .",
    "consider the standard spatially homogeneous and isotropic line element @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the cosmic scale factor and @xmath105 is @xmath106 , @xmath107 or @xmath108 , corresponding to the closed , open , or flat universes , respectively .",
    "due to the symmetries of the embedded 4-dimensional universe , the energy - momentum tensor is taken to be diagonal .",
    "hence , we adopt the a perfect fluid form for the energy - momentum tensor in comoving coordinates , as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the pressure along the extra dimensions , inside of thick brane .    as we know , the line element ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) is conformally flat . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that a submanifold of a conformally flat ambient space is conformally flat if and only if it is totally quasiumbilical and a totally quasiumbilical submanifold of a conformally flat space is always conformally flat @xcite .",
    "this means that for a totally quasiumbilical submanifold , the second fundamental form is given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are arbitrary functions .",
    "in particular , if @xmath114 , then the submanifold is said to be cylindrical and if @xmath115 , then the submanifold is said to be totally umbilical .",
    "one can obtain the components of extrinsic curvature from the second set of the field equations ( [ 1 - 38 ] ) as @xmath116 where @xmath117 are arbitrary functions of cosmic time @xmath118 , and @xmath119 is the hubble parameter .",
    "note that , @xmath112 and @xmath113 in equation ( [ 1,1 ] ) can be verified in comparison with equation ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) as @xmath120 which shows that our calculations are consistent with above theorem on the quasiumbilical submanifolds .",
    "the values of normal curvature of flrw universe can be obtained from equation ( [ 1 - 18 ] ) as @xmath121 note that to determine uniquely the extrinsic curvature , the arbitrary functions @xmath122 must be determined .",
    "notwithstanding the fact that we considered more than one extra dimension , the junction condition is not applicable .",
    "hence , extra assumptions are needed to determine the extrinsic curvature .",
    "first , the symmetries of spacetime lets us assume the functions @xmath117 to be equal ; @xmath123 .",
    "if we set @xmath124 and assume @xmath125 , the normal curvature radii will be @xmath126 therefore , according to equations ( [ sh11 ] ) , ( [ r1 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) the induced @xmath18 gravitational `` constant '' and the fine structure `` constant '' , @xmath127 , are not actually true constants and dependent on the local normal radii of @xmath18 submanifold as @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the present value of @xmath130 and @xmath131 is the fine structure at the present epoch .",
    "on the other hand , using equations ( [ sh7 ] ) and ( [ sh8 ] ) , the line element of ambient space will be @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "also , the extrinsic curvature of any perturbed submanifold , inside of thick brane , using ( [ sha1 ] ) or ( [ sha2 ] ) will be @xmath135 therefore , the deformed geometry will be well defined if we know two independent fields : the metric and the bending function of non - perturbed submanifold .    the components of @xmath97 defined in ( [ 1 - 0 ] ) for an quasiumbilical submanifold will be @xmath136 therefore , for flrw universe , using equations ( [ 2 - 4 ] ) in field equations ( [ 1 - 38 ] ) plus generalized conservation equation for matter field @xmath137 for perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath138 , the induced friedmann equations will be @xmath139 also , determining the trace of the first equation in ( [ 1 - 38 ] ) and plugging it into the third equation of ( [ 1 - 38 ] ) , leads to @xmath140 which shows that the constancy of thickness gives a simple restriction on the pressure component of the confined matter fields along the extra dimensions . since we do not yet know the functional form of @xmath71 or @xmath141 , we have only the formal structure of a theory . to be able to solve above dynamical equations , we must specify @xmath71 .",
    "for this purpose we use a simple phenomenological form for gravitational `` constant '' as @xmath142 which using ( [ 2 - 7 ] ) leads to @xmath143 consequently , the field equations ( [ 2 - 9 ] ) will be @xmath144 the behavior of @xmath71 near a spacetime singularity depends on the topological nature of that singularity .",
    "in the point - like singularity ( like flrw case ) all values of @xmath145 tend to zero so that @xmath71 also tends to zero .",
    "this property plus the form of @xmath71 in equation ( [ r4 ] ) implies @xmath146 . on the other hand ,",
    "a recent fit of about 30 years of llr data yields the excellent measurement constraint on the time variation of @xmath11 @xcite @xmath147 which is a small fraction , about @xmath148 , of the observed hubble expansion rate of the universe .",
    "hence , @xmath149 . as we see from the friedmann equations ( [ 2 - 9aa ] ) , the extrinsic curvature plays the role of cosmological `` constant '' , where @xmath150 therefore , the extrinsic shape of brane induces a cosmological `` constant '' proportional to the inverse - square of normal curvature radii , @xmath151 explicitly , by inserting equation ( [ 1,35,0 ] ) into ( [ r6 ] ) we obtain @xmath152 where @xmath153 denotes reduced planck s length at the present epoch . an interesting point to note",
    "is that the obtained cosmological constant is inversely proportional to the sixth power of brane thickness , the inverse of the coupling constants .",
    "let us now back to the number of extra dimensions in our model . according to the janet - cartan theorem @xcite",
    ", an riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath154 can be embedded locally and isometrically into ambient riemannian space of dimension @xmath12 , if @xmath155 .",
    "friedman generalized this theorem to the case of lorentzian manifolds and showed that the same result is holed @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a 4-dimensional embedded spacetime , the theorem ensures the existence of a local isometric embedding for @xmath156 . on the other hand ,",
    "one of the major goals of field equations ( [ 1 - 38 ] ) is to find a geometrical method to unify fundamental forces , using the group of isometries of the ambient space @xcite .",
    "when we identify the extrinsic twist vector fields @xmath42 with the physical gauge fields , a simple arithmetic fixes also the number of extra dimensions : for the standard model @xmath157 it was found that the self - contained gauge structure requires 11 dimensions @xcite .",
    "let us return to the thickness of brane .",
    "the thickness of brane can be taken as a fundamental minimal length related to the the trapped standard model interactions on the brane .",
    "for example , let @xmath44 be of order of the planck length , then according to equation ( [ 2 - 26 ] ) we have @xmath158 ( or equivalently @xmath159 ) .",
    "this is the value predicted by by particle physics field . at the opposite end , by considering @xmath160 it leads to a very small cosmological constant . in embedding models of gravity",
    ", we usually assume that the standard model matter fields are confined to the @xmath18 submanifold .",
    "but in accordance with heisenberg s principle the confinement causes the matter fields to fluctuate very strongly in the direction normal to the submanifold , along the extra dimensions . in other words , if we assume that @xmath161 , then the momentum of confined particles along extra dimensions will be infinitely large .",
    "for example , trying to localize an particle to within less than its compton wavelength makes its momentum so uncertain that it can have an energy large enough to make an extra particle - antiparticle pair . in this direction",
    ", there is another supportive argument .",
    "suppose a massless dirac ( klein - gordon ) equation in the ambient space .",
    "for a @xmath12-dimensional spinorial field ( scalar field ) we may make the harmonic expansion on the compact manifold constructed from thickness of brane @xcite .",
    "then the induced fields are mass eigenstates in @xmath18 spacetime , with @xmath162 where @xmath163 , which shows that the thickness is proportional with the inverse of lowest mass , @xmath164 , particles .",
    "therefore , according to the quantum mechanics the thickness of brane is proportional with the compton wavelength of trapped baryonic matter ( since most of the mass of ordinary matter comes from the protons and neutrons inside atomic nuclei , and protons and neutrons are classified by particle physicists as baryons ) which can be thought of as a fundamental limitation on measuring the position of a particles . in the strong interactions physics",
    ", it is sometimes assumed that coupling to the lowest mass mesons determines the localization size of hadrons to be @xmath165 in the manner first described by yukawa @xcite . on the other hand , as we know , all hadrons couple via the strong interaction to low mass mesons .",
    "consequently , the thickness of brane can not be appreciably less than the range of the strong interactions @xmath166 fm . further evidence in support of the idea that all hadrons , e.g. nucleons , couple strongly to low mass mesons is the fact that pions are the principal secondary component in high - energy collisions @xcite .",
    "therefore , in a good approximation @xmath44 is set to be the overlap of the quark and antiquark wave functions in the pions , @xmath167 @xmath168 @xcite ( size of all hadrons are @xmath169 ) .",
    "therefore , we adopt @xmath170 inserting this relation into the equation ( [ 2 - 26 ] ) and also @xmath171 , we obtain @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the strong interaction pion - nucleon coupling parameter at the present epoch @xcite . therefore , the vale of the cosmological constant is greatly controlled by extrinsic size of trapped baryonic matter on the brane which causes the cosmological constant to be small . the cosmological constant and its energy density",
    "can be obtained as @xmath174 which is well consistent with the observation @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath175 is approximately equal to the compton wavelength of the pion .",
    "hence , the energy density of the cosmological constant approximately is @xmath176 remarkably , equation ( [ 3 ] ) is identical to the scaling law proposed by zeldovich @xcite .",
    "if the cosmological constant originates from the vacuum energy of particle physics , it suffers from a serious problem of its energy scale relative to the dark energy density today @xcite .",
    "a reasonable attitude towards this open problem is the hope that quantum gravity will explain that the vacuum does not gravitate , @xmath177 @xcite .",
    "hence , one may be able to argue that cosmological constant , or dark energy , has really a gravitational - geometrical origin and is not connected to the vacuum energy .",
    "to solve the cosmological constant problem , following @xcite , we introduced a new gravitational model in which our spacetime is embedded in the ambient space with seven extra dimensions .",
    "the use of nash - morse implicit function theorem , lets the embedded spacetime to have a thickness . as a application",
    ", we considered the flrw cosmological model to be embedded in @xmath178 ambient space .",
    "consequently , the induced gravitational constant is a function of the extrinsic normal curvature of spacetime .",
    "the violation of strong equivalence principle implies the age of universe as a time scale of variation and therefore the variation of @xmath11 can not be expected to be larger than @xmath179 .",
    "this suggest that the induced extrinsic term in field equations is of the cosmological constant type . according to the equation ( [ 13 ] ) , the present value of cosmological constant can be described in terms of @xmath18 gravitational constant , the strong interaction pion - nucleon coupling parameter and the size of overlapping of the quark and antiquark wave functions in the pions .",
    "this theoretical obtained value of cosmological constant is consistent with the observations .",
