    "the standard model ( sm ) fulfills all three sakharov conditions @xcite for generating a baryon asymmetry in the universe @xcite .",
    "however , the model fails to explain the value of the asymmetry , @xmath4 , measured through the cosmic microwave background @xcite , or the value required for the primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite , for two reasons .",
    "the first reason is that cp violation from the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism @xcite is highly suppressed @xcite .",
    "the second reason is that the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) is not strongly first - order .",
    "the experimental lower bound on the higgs mass , @xmath5 gev @xcite , implies that there is no ewpt in the sm @xcite .",
    "consequently , spharelon - induced ( b+l)-violating interactions are not sufficiently suppressed in the broken phase and wash out the baryon asymmetry . if the physics at the electroweak scale could explain the baryon asymmetry in the universe , the better understanding of the structure of the higgs sector and the source of cp violation would be required .",
    "various extensions of the higgs sector have been investigated from the above point of view : these include two higgs doublet model @xcite , minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , mssm with an extra singlet scalar @xcite , the sm with a low cut - off @xcite , and so on .",
    "the orginal higgs sector of the sm , if the electroweak interactions is turned off , is nothing but the o(4 ) linear sigma model and its finite temperature phase transition is second order , which is governed by the wilson - fisher ir - stable fixed point .",
    "it is the effect of the gauge interaction which makes the fixed point ir - unstable and causes a first - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "once the higgs sector is extended , the number of the scalar fields is increased and there appear additional quartic couplings among them .",
    "the fixed points of the multiple quartic coupling constants may be ir - unstable and one can expect a first - order phase transition even in the pure scalar sector @xcite . a related approach is to consider the single higgs doublet model ( the o(4 ) model ) with the dimension - six or higher operators @xcite .",
    "the quartic coupling is then assumed to be negative so that the model is out of the domain of the wilson - fisher fixed point .",
    "such higher dimensional operators may be induced by the effect of heavy particles coupled to the higgs doublet , or more generally , by the effect of a certain dynamical system behind the higgs sector .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the finite temperature restoration of su(@xmath3)@xmath1su(@xmath3 ) chiral symmetry with a large @xmath3 from the point of view of the electroweak phase transition .",
    "it has been argued by pisarski and wilczek that _",
    "if @xmath6 , the restoration of the chiral symmetry at finite temperature should be first - order _ , through the renormalization group analysis of linear sigma model as a low energy effective theory of qcd @xcite @xcite .",
    "the chiral symmetry with a large @xmath3 may appear in the higgs sector as a symmetry of a certain underlying dynamical system such as walking technicolor theories @xcite .",
    "we will examine whether the first - order phase transition associated with the chiral symmetry restoration can be strong enough for the electroweak baryogenesis to operate .",
    "a similar consideration has been performed by appelquist et al . in @xcite .",
    "following pisarski and wilczek , we consider the renormalizable su(@xmath3)@xmath1su(@xmath3 ) linear sigma model with a large @xmath3 as a low energy effective theory of a certain underlying dynamical system such as walking techinicolor theories . in adopting the model for the higgs sector ,",
    "we couple the su(2)@xmath1u(1 ) electroweak interactions and introduce the explicit symmetry breaking terms which give rise to the masses of the extra nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons .",
    "we will examine the chiral symmetry restoration in the model by the @xmath7-expansion @xcite and by the finite temperature effective potential obtained at one - loop in the ring - improved perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the sphaleron energy will be also re - examined within this model in order to clarify the criterion for the strength of the first - order transition @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the finite - temperature effective potential has been examined in a large @xmath3 expansion , but only for the case of the pure linear sigma model without the gauge interactions nor the explicit symmetry breaking terms .",
    "since the critical behavior of first - order phase transition at finite temperature that we concern , is not universal in general , the result of our analysis would depend on our choice of low energy effective theory , where a certain truncation of fields and operators has to be done .",
    "moreover , for the validity of the perturbation theory at finite temperature , the gauge- and scalar- coupling constants must satisfy certain constraints .",
    "it turns out that one can not push the masses of the scalar fields to so large values as expected in walking technicolor theories : the masses of the scalar fields are up to 300 gev and in particular the mass of the neutral scalar field which corresponds to the higgs field is up to 150 gev . our analysis , therefore , must be qualitative , just showing a possibility to realize strongly first - order electroweak phase transition required for the electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "we leave more thorough quantitative study of this possibility for other non - perturbative methods like the monte calro simulation in lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "we do not address , in this paper , the question about a possible new source of cp violation which is required for the electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "the sector which is responsible for the flavor physics , in particular , the generation of the masses of quarks and leptons , may well affect the dynamics of the chiral symmetry breaking / restoration .",
    "this effect of the flavor sector may be partly incorporated into the linear sigma model through the yukawa couplings to quarks and leptons and the explict symmetry breaking terms which give rise to the masses and the interactions of the pseudo nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons .",
    "however , the experimental constraints on the flavor sector make it quite non - trivial to build a model of dymanical electroweak symmetry breaking which takes account of the flavor physics .",
    "( see @xcite for recent progress in constructing a complete theory of fermion masses in the context of extended technicolor theories . ) in view of this situation , we simply omit the yukawa couplings to quarks and leptons ( and the cp violating phases ) and consider only the effect of the explicit symmetry breaking terms in the scalar fields .",
    "we choose the range and the pattern of the mass spectrum of the pseudo ng bosons so that the masses are within the allowed region of the direct search experiments @xcite and the contribution to the s parameter is not positive @xcite .    at zero temperature ,",
    "the phase transition associated with the breaking / restoration of su(@xmath3 ) @xmath1 su(@xmath3 ) chiral symmetry with a large @xmath3 has been examined by several authors @xcite . in su(@xmath8 ) vector - like gauge theories with @xmath3 massless flavors , there appears a non - trivial ir fixed point ( the banks - zaks fixed point ) @xcite in the weak coupling perturbation theory for @xmath3 large , but slightly less than @xmath9 .",
    "as @xmath3 is lowered , the value of the fixed - point coupling becomes larger .",
    "if the banks - zaks fixed point persists to larger coupling , it may exceed the critical value for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it has been argued that this `` phase transition in the number of flavors @xmath3 '' shows the peculiar nature : the transition is not second order even though the order parameter changes continuously .",
    "the critical behavior is not universal , where , from the side of the broken phase , the entire spectrum collapses to zero mass and contributes to any correlation functions .",
    "then , one can not reduce the theory to an effective low - energy scalar theory .",
    "however , in a real life , @xmath3 is supposed to be a fixed integer between the `` critical value '' @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "although there would be some very light particles besides the ng bosons , one may assume a description by a certain low energy effective theory which may include these light particles .",
    "the linear sigma model we consider in this paper is hopefully one of such low energy effective theories .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
