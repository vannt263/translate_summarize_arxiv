    "in recent years , a growing number of x - ray binaries have been found to exhibit absorption lines from highly ionized elements ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "these systems range from microquasars such as gro  j1655@xmath840 @xcite and grs  1915 + 105 @xcite to low - mass x - ray binaries such as gx  13 + 1 @xcite , x  1658@xmath8298 @xcite and x  1254@xmath8690 @xcite .",
    "these systems are viewed at high inclination angles , and the absorption structure is visible throughout the orbital period ( e.g. @xcite ; 2002 ) .",
    "the absorption features are therefore thought to originate in material that is associated with and extends above the outer accretion disk .",
    "this is illuminated by the x - rays produced from the innermost regions of the accretion flow ( both the disk and hard x - ray coronal emission ) . the reprocessed emission and",
    "scattered flux from the extended wind can be seen directly in the accretion disk corona sources , where the intrinsic x - rays are obscured ( e.g. kallman et al .",
    "2003 ) , but for the majority of highly inclined sources , the wind material is seen in absorption against the much brighter intrinsic central x - ray source .",
    "multiple absorption lines seen there then give an excellent probe of the physical conditions in the wind ( e.g. ueda et al .",
    "2004 ; miller et al .",
    "2006 ) , where the spectra indicate the presence of significant amounts of highly ionized outflowing material .",
    "such accretion disk winds can be produced by thermal driving ( e.g. , begelman et al .",
    "1983 ) , and/or by magnetic forces @xcite as inferred by @xcite from chandra hetgs data of gro  j@xmath9 .",
    "4u  1630@xmath8472 is a black hole candidate ( e.g. , @xcite ) , known for x - ray outbursts that repeat with an interval of roughly 600690 days ( jones et al .",
    "1976 ; parmar , angelini & white 1995 ) .",
    "the source has been observed with every major mission from exosat ( @xcite ; parmar et al .",
    "1986 ) , ginga ( parmar et al . 1997 ) , batse cgro ( bloser et al . 1996 ) , to beppo - sax ( oosterbroek et al .",

    "these x - ray observations showed that the source is absorbed heavily with @xmath10@xmath11 ( tomsick et al .",
    "1998 ; kuulkers et al . 1997 ; cui et al .",
    "2000 ; trudolyubov et al .",
    "2001 ; @xcite ) . while the ir counterpart was found during a 1998 outburst by augusteijn et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , no optical counterpart is known for 4u  1630@xmath8472 , most likely due to its high reddening and location in a crowded star field ( parmar , stella & white 1986 ) .",
    "thus , the distance , inclination angle , and mass of the compact object are unknown for 4u  1630@xmath8472 .",
    "this source is classified as a black hole not from dynamic mass measurements , but because of the similarity of its x - ray spectral and timing properties to those of systems with measured black hole masses .",
    "this source was observed six times with suzaku during its most recent outburst as part of a program to study discrete spectral structures as a function of the changing accretion conditions .",
    "the suzaku monitoring observation led to successful detection of absorption lines on all occasions .",
    "though one of the absorption lines may have been detected by chandra ( j. miller , private communication ) , the suzaku xis data reveal the line with a much higher significance , thanks to its larger effective area at 7  kev than that of chandra . in this paper , we focus mainly on the absorption line structures , and how these discrete features evolve over the two months span of our observations . considering the large absorption column density , we assume the source distance , @xmath12 , at @xmath13  kpc in this paper .",
    "in addition , by comparison to the other black hole binaries reported to show absorption lines , an inclination angle , @xmath14 , of @xmath15 is assumed .",
    "errors quoted in this paper represent 90% confidence limit for a single parameter unless otherwise specified .",
    "an outburst of 4u  @xmath0 was reported by the rxte all sky monitor ( asm ; @xcite ) on 2005 december . from 2006",
    "february 8 through march 23 , we observed the source six times with a series of 2123  ks exposures as part of the initial performance verification of suzaku .",
    "suzaku is the 5th x - ray astronomy satellite of japan launched on july 10 , 2005 , with an m - v rocket from the uchinoura space center ( mitsuda et al .",
    "it carries 4 sets of x - ray telescopes ( @xcite ) each with a focal - plane x - ray ccd camera ( xis , x - ray imaging spectrometer ; @xcite ) operating in the energy range of 0.212  kev , together with a non - imaging hard x - ray detector ( hxd , takahashi et al .",
    "2006 ) , which covers the 10600 kev energy band with si pin photo - diodes and gso scintillation counters .",
    "three of the xis ( xis0 , 2 , 3 ) have front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds , while xis1 utilizes a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd , achieving an improved soft x - ray response but poorer hard x - ray sensitivity . considering the large column density to 4u  @xmath0 , we concentrate on the harder x - ray band in this paper , and only analyze the data from the fi ccds .",
    "figure  [ fig : asm ] shows a lightcurve of 4u  @xmath0 obtained by the rxte asm .",
    "the suzaku observations are indicated with downward arrows . because the optical axes of the xis and the hxd are slightly offset , the source was put at the center of the hxd field of view during the observations , to maximize the hxd count rate , and to reduce the xis count rate as pileup",
    "is an issue for such a bright source ( see below ) .",
    "the hxd was operated in the nominal mode throughout the observations .",
    "because the source was very bright , the xis was operated with the 1/4 window option , in which a smaller field of view of @xmath16 is read out every 2  s. a burst option was added in the first four observations .",
    "this decreases the effective exposure by a factor of two .",
    "the editing modes of the fi ccds ( xis023 ) were set to @xmath17 and @xmath18 for high and medium data rates , respectively .",

    "the screening of the version 0.7 xis data are based on the following standard criteria : a ) only grade0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 events are accumulated , b ) the time interval after passage through the south atlantic anomaly is larger than 436 seconds , c ) the object is at least @xmath32 and @xmath33 above the rim of the earth during night and day , respectively .",
    "we limit our analysis to the @xmath17 mode data ( high data rate ) , because the @xmath18 mode data ( medium data rate ) are not well calibrated at this time . during the 2nd and 5th observations ,",
    "more than half of the exposure was acquired in @xmath18 mode , and thus these data have poorer statistics .",
    "the exposure times for the total and high data rate are summarized in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the xis events were extracted from a circular region with a radius of @xmath34 centered on the image peak .",
    "this extraction circle is larger than the window size .",
    "the effective extraction region is therefore the intersection of the window and this circle .",
    "the background was entirely negligible throughout the six observations ( less than 1% of the signal at 9  kev ) , so was not subtracted from the data . using xis2 as a reference , we find that the 210  kev count rate declined over the six observations , with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 respectively , roughly corresponding to 4.6 , 4.0 , 3.1 , 2.8 , 2.5 , and @xmath41 in the same energy band . within each observation",
    ", we find no significant intensity variation intrinsic to the source .",
    "the source was so bright during these observations that the xis suffered from photon pileup at the image center .",
    "a rough threshold above which the photon pileup becomes significant is @xmath42  cts  exposure@xmath43 for a point source .",
    "the count rates of 4u  @xmath0 during the observations were around this level .",
    "furthermore , because 4u  @xmath0 has a very soft energy spectrum , the effect of photon pileup can be significant in the hard band spectra .",
    "therefore , we excluded a circular region of @xmath44 at the image center from the event extraction region to minimize these effects .",
    "this did not remove the photon pileup completely , and an artificial structure is seen as a hard excess above @xmath45  kev at the @xmath46510% level . because photon pileup tends to produce x - ray events which have twice ( or a little more ) as high an energy as the most abundant events ( in this case , about 4 kev ) , we modeled the artificial structure as a gaussian centered at 10  kev with a fixed width of @xmath47  kev .",
    "as seen in the next section , this phenomenological model works quite well to compensate for the effect of pileup .    because the event extraction region has a complex shape ( an annulus truncated with the window size ) , we calculated the effective area for each xis sensor by using xissimarfgen ( version 2006 - 04 - 24 ) , which calculates the arf file through monte carlo simulations .",
    "the three fi ccds have almost the same performance , so we have added their data to increase the statistics in the spectra .",
    "hereafter we refer to the summed data as xis023 .",
    "we calculated the corresponding instrumental responses by summing the latest redistribution matrices of ae_xi[0,2,3]_20060213.rmf using the ftool addrmf and the arf files using the ftool addarf .",
    "though the main objective of this paper is the absorption structure in the xis energy band , it is also useful to understand the continuum emission since this provides a knowledge of spectral states and photoionising flux .",
    "we thus analyzed the hxd data using only the pin data , since the source is dim in the gso band .",
    "both high and medium data rate are used in the pin data analysis .",
    "the version 0.7 pin data are screened by the following selection criteria : a ) the object is at least @xmath32 above the earth rim , b ) the time interval after passage through the south atlantic anomaly is longer than 500 seconds , c ) the cutoff rigidity is greater than @xmath48 .",
    "the pin background events were provided by the hxd team for each observation based on two different models , a and b ( kokubun et al .",
    "here we constructed the pin background spectra based on model b filtered by the same good time intervals .",
    "the latest version of the response matrix , ae_hxd_pinhxnom_20060419.rmf , was used in our spectral analysis . even if we allow 5% systematic uncertainty in the background level , the source is clearly detected up to 40  kev and 35  kev in pin data from the first four and last two observations , respectively .",
    "dead time fractions were calculated from the pseudo event rates ( @xcite ) as 5.3 , 4.3 , 4.6 , 5.1 , 4.6 , and 4.6% , in the first to last observations , respectively .",
    "after the dead time correction , the background subtracted pin count rates are estimated to be 0.16 , 0.13 , 0.093 , 0.065 , 0.055 , and 0.043  @xmath49 in the range of 2040  kev , corresponding to 6.9 , 6.7 , 5.0 , 3.5 , 2.6 , and @xmath50 .      because the xis calibration is still in progress ,",
    "we include a brief description of the calibration uncertainties .",
    "the xis energy scale is relatively well calibrated with an uncertainty of less than 5  ev , or 0.2% when the standard mode is used ( @xcite ) . however , when a window option is applied , the gain can change slightly , because the number of frame - store and parallel transfers are different than in the standard mode .",
    "this difference is not taken into account in the version 0.7 processing software . since",
    "a window option was used for all the observations of 4u  @xmath0 , the xis instrument team estimates that this produces a systematic gain difference of @xmath110  ev at 6  kev at the time of 4u  @xmath0 observations . when the window option is used , the onboard @xmath51fe calibration source is not directly visible but some events can be scattered into the active window in xis2 , which has the strongest calibration sources .",
    "the scattered @xmath51fe events are accumulated from the regions free from the source photons ( @xmath52 of the window area for each side ) .",
    "we obtain an average energy of @xmath53  ev .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath110  ev offset estimated above .",
    "we also examined the data for a possible gain shift due to the large surface brightness ( local event density ) of the image , by comparing the absorption line energies in the observed spectra for different radii of extraction annuli .",
    "we find no significant differences .",
    "thus a conservative estimate is that the xis gain at the iron band is correct to within 20  ev during the 4u  @xmath0 observations .",
    "the energy resolution of the xis is gradually degrading due to the radiation damage on the ccd .",
    "however , this effect is not yet included in the currently available response matrices . at the time of the 4u  @xmath0 observations",
    ", a narrow line at 6 kev would appear broadened with @xmath54  ev , where @xmath55 is an equivalent gaussian width ( standard deviation ) .",
    "thus , when we evaluate a line width , we take this effect into account .",
    "it is important to note that this does not affect the measurement of the equivalent width .",
    "the effective areas of the xis and pin are calibrated using observations of the crab nebula .",
    "the accuracy is expected to be 510% .",
    "this is sufficient to estimate various emission parameters of 4u  @xmath0 .",
    "however , because of the very good statistics of the data , the systematic errors in calibration could degrade the model fitting significantly .",
    "a major contribution to the systematic error is the calibration uncertainty at gold m - ii edge in the instrumental response . to account for this residual",
    ", we added a gaussian at @xmath56  kev with a fixed width of @xmath57  kev .",
    "figure  [ fig : rawspec_xis - pin]a shows the 250  kev spectra of 4u  @xmath0 obtained with the xis023 and the pin .",
    "we do not use data below 2  kev , because of large interstellar absorption . an instrument - independent way to view",
    "the spectra is to construct the ratio of the source spectra to the corresponding data from the crab nebula , which has an approximately power - law spectrum with @xmath58 , and interstellar absorption of @xmath59 ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : rawspec_xis - pin]b shows the crab ratios calculated using the crab data obtained with suzaku on 2006 april 5 at the hxd nominal position and the xis operated with the 1/4 window option .",
    "this plot reveals several noticeable features in the broad band source spectra .",
    "the source spectra are characterized by a dominant soft thermal component in the xis band , which is heavily absorbed , while the harder x - ray pin data clearly show a weak power - law tail .",
    "the dominant soft component is generally observed from bright black hole binaries in the high / soft state @xcite , and is believed to be emission from the optically thick standard accretion disk ( @xcite ) . in the crab ratio ( figure  [ fig : rawspec_xis - pin]b ) , the weak power - law tail is roughly characterized as @xmath60 in the first two observations . when the 2050  kev pin spectra of these two observations are fitted with the single power - law model under the current response matrix , the values of @xmath61 are obtained as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the extrapolated 20100  kev fluxes are estimated as @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , which are only 3  % of the absorbed disk flux in the range of 210  kev . though the steeper power - law tails may be suggested on the latter four observations from the crab ratio plot ( figure  [ fig : rawspec_xis - pin]b ) , they are difficult to quantify because of their faintness under the current background uncertainty .",
    "further detailed analysis of the hxd data will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "the dominance of the disk and the weak power - law tail are both characteristic of the high / soft state .",
    "in addition , the crab ratios also reveal the presence of complex absorption structures in the iron k band . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on these absorption line structures and their relation to the accretion disk parameters .",
    "hereafter , we perform detailed spectral analyses on the xis data .",
    "( 80mm,60mm)figure2a.ps ( 80mm,60mm)figure2b.ps      figure  [ fig : spec_xis2 - 10 ] shows the 210  kev xis raw spectra . to reproduce the continuum spectra",
    ", we use the multi - color disk model ( diskbb in xspec , @xcite ) modified by interstellar absorption ( wabs model ; @xcite ) , following the canonical modeling for the high / soft state black hole binaries . here",
    ", the diskbb model approximates emission from the standard accretion disk , and is known to successfully reproduce the dominant soft spectra of the high / soft state black holes . as shown in figure",
    "[ fig : rawspec_xis - pin]b , the contribution of the power - law tail is negligible in the xis energy band , so is not included in the spectral fitting .",
    "the residual effects of pileup are modeled by a broad gaussian at 10  kev ( see   2.2 ) , and the current uncertainties in the instrument response at the gold m - ii edge by another gaussian at 3.2  kev ( see   2.3 ) .",
    "we start with the first observation , which showed the brightest spectrum . the continuum is well reproduced by the diskbb model with a disk temperature of @xmath66  kev .",
    "this is amongst the highest disk temperatures observed with rxte from this source in previous high / soft states ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a disk bolometric luminosity of @xmath67 and an apparent disk inner radius of @xmath68  km are obtained , where @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70 . the absorbing column density , @xmath71 ,",
    "is estimated to be @xmath72 .",
    "this is close to that seen with previous observations by asca and rxte ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the fit with this simple model is however far from acceptable ( @xmath73 ) because of the complex structure in the iron k band .",
    "residuals between the data and the best - fit continuum model are shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : spec_xis2 - 10]a .",
    "the most obvious features are two narrow dips at 7.0  kev and 6.8  kev .",
    "we therefore add two negative gaussians to the model .",
    "the fit is dramatically improved with @xmath74 .",
    "the line center energies are estimated to be @xmath75  kev and @xmath76  kev , consistent with the h - like and he - like iron k@xmath2 lines at 6.966  kev and 6.697  kev   and k@xmath77 by referring to the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ; see http://aeldata.phy.nist.gov/archive/data.html ) and @xcite for h - like and he - like k@xmath2 , respectively . ] ; the lines are possibly blue - shifted with @xmath78 .",
    "the equivalent widths are 30  ev and 7  ev , for the h - like and he - like lines , respectively .",
    "the lines are narrow with an upper limit to @xmath55 of 40  ev and 50  ev .",
    "these values are consistent with what we expect for narrow lines given the current response matrix , which does not include the degradation of the energy resolution (   2.3 ) .",
    "we thus fix the value of @xmath55 at 10  ev to represent intrinsically narrow lines in this subsection .",
    "in addition to these obvious line structures , the residuals reveal weaker absorption structures at 7.8  kev and 8.2  kev .",
    "these energies are very similar to the rest frame energies of he - like and h - like iron k@xmath3 lines , namely 7.88  kev and 8.25  kev .",
    "however , they are also close in energy to the he - like and h - like nickel k@xmath2 lines at 7.80  kev and 8.09  kev , respectively , which can have comparable equivalent width to that of the iron k@xmath3 lines ( kotani et al 2000 ) .",
    "the data can marginally constrain two weak lines at these energies , but not four .",
    "hence we include two additional negative gaussians , again with the width @xmath55 fixed at 10  ev , and allow the energies to vary freely .",
    "this decreases @xmath79 to @xmath80 , indicating that the two negative gaussians are statistically significant at the 99.98% confidence level using an @xmath81-test ( where @xmath82 ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : gaussfit ] .",
    "residuals between the data and the best - fit model are shown in the bottom panel in figure  [ fig : spec_xis2 - 10]a .",
    "the inferred energies are almost consistent with h - like and he - like iron k@xmath3 , though they can be contaminated by nickel k@xmath2 .",
    "we performed the same spectral analysis on the other five observations .",
    "the xis spectra , the best - fit models , and the residuals are shown in figure  [ fig : spec_xis2 - 10]b  f . the best - fit continuum and absorption parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : gaussfit ] , and the time histories of the continuum parameters are given in figure  [ fig : disk ] .",
    "through the six observations over two months , the value of @xmath83 remained approximately constant at @xmath84  km , while the disk temperature gradually decreased to 1.18  kev , corresponding to a factor 1.75 decrease in the disk bolometric luminosity to @xmath85 .",
    "the constancy of @xmath83 is another characteristic feature of the high / soft state of black hole binaries ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , and confirms that the object was indeed in the high / soft state .",
    "the correlated decrease in the derived value of @xmath71 by @xmath13% could be an artifact of the over - simplified diskbb model ; it assumes that the disk radiates locally as a blackbody , but distortions from this are suggested both observationally ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and theoretically ( @xcite ; @xcite ) from such luminous binaries .",
    "irrespective of the continuum modeling , the two strong iron k@xmath2 lines are clearly detected throughout the observations , whereas the weaker lines at higher energies are significantly detected in the first four datasets ( @xmath81-test significance values are given in table  [ tab : gaussfit ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 - 9 ] shows an enlargement of the 69  kev spectra , and residuals between the data and the continuum model .",
    "the time histories of the individual absorption - line equivalent widths and their energies are plotted in figure  [ fig : gauss ] . while the equivalent width of the h - like line was almost constant throughout the observations , that of the he - like line increased by a factor of two between the first and second observations , and then perhaps increased slightly more through the subsequent observations .",
    "these imply that the ionization state of the absorbing gas decreased over time , as expected from the declining source luminosity .",
    "the time averaged center energies of the two strong iron k@xmath2 lines are estimated to be @xmath86  kev and @xmath87  kev , suggesting a blue shift velocity of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "if we take only the first observation , the blue shifts become more significant with @xmath90 and @xmath91 , for the h - like and he - like irons , respectively . here , the errors are statistical only .",
    "given the current uncertainty in the gain calibration of @xmath92  ev or @xmath93 ( see   2.3 ) , the blue shift can not be measured with higher significance .",

    "they depend on the plasma thickness @xmath440 , and the longer distance and higher density are realized on the the condition of smaller @xmath440 .",

    "there are no significant changes over the six observations , but the data are consistent with a small increase in @xmath426 and/or a small decrease in @xmath446 as the luminosity decreases .",
    "there are some uncertainties on these numbers due to the statistical uncertainties in @xmath212 and @xmath211 , but the larger source of uncertainty is systematic from the assumed velocity dispersion of @xmath201 .",
    "the lower limit on @xmath187 gives an upper limit on @xmath212 and @xmath211 , and thus results in smaller launching radius with larger density .",
    "considering our range in @xmath187 of 200@xmath420 , the allowed range of @xmath426 is estimated to be ( 0.24)@xmath453  cm and ( 15)@xmath453  cm for the first and the last observations , respectively .",
    "the estimated launch radii are much smaller than the distance traveled by the absorbing material over a single 20  ks observation from the measured blue shift of @xmath454 , @xmath455 .",
    "thus the persistence of the wind over the two - month monitoring period , where the source was always in the high / soft state , shows that the material is not associated with a one  off event such as a state transition .",
    "neither can it be connected to the jet since the radio emission is strongly suppressed in the high / soft state ( fender et al . 1999 ) .",
    "instead it must be produced by the disk in a continuous or quasi - continuous manner .",
    "here we use the estimated physical parameters of the absorber to constrain the driving mechanism for this wind .",
    "one of the candidate mechanisms is radiation pressure on electrons , which becomes dynamically important as @xmath456 approaches @xmath457 , reducing the effective gravity by a factor @xmath458 .",
    "this can be made much more efficient if the cross - section for interaction between the matter and radiation is enhanced by line opacity .",
    "there are multiple line transitions in the uv region of the spectrum , so uv emitting disks can drive a powerful wind at luminosities far below eddington .",
    "such line driven disk winds are seen in cv s ( @xcite ) and are probably also responsible for the broad absorption line ( bal ) outflows seen in agn ( @xcite ) . however , the disk temperature for black hole binaries is in the x - ray regime , so line driving is probably unimportant here ( proga & kallman 2002 ) .",
    "we do indeed see lines , but the momentum absorbed in these iron transitions is very small , completely insufficient to drive the wind .",
    "another type of outflow from a disk is a thermally driven wind ( @xcite ) . here again the central illumination is important , but the process is less direct .",
    "the illumination heats the upper layers of the disk to a temperature of order the compton temperature , @xmath459 .",
    "this will expand due to the pressure gradient , and at large enough radii the thermal energy driving the expansion is larger than the binding energy , leading to a wind from the outer disk .",
    "simple estimates of the launching radius of this wind give @xmath460 cm ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is a much larger distance than inferred for our wind .",
    "however , this is an overestimate , and a more careful analysis shows that thermal winds are launched at a radius a factor 510 smaller than this ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the _ combination _ of thermal driving and radiation pressure from moderately sub - eddington illumination can be much more effective at producing a wind .",
    "the hydrodynamic calculation of proga & kallman ( 2002 ) shows that thermal driving with @xmath461 gives a powerful wind from well within the expected thermal driving radius .",
    "their simulation is not exactly matched to the situation here , as they model a neutron star rather than a black hole .",
    "nonetheless , their wind is launched from a distance of around @xmath462 , has a column between @xmath463 @xmath464 and ionization of @xmath465 for inclinations larger than @xmath15 .",
    "this is very close to our inferred parameters for the wind seen here in 4u  @xmath0 .",
    "the simulation even has an outflow velocity of @xmath454 as currently indicated by the data .",
    "the last type of outflow is a magnetically driven wind .",
    "these are much harder to quantitatively study as the magnetic field configuration is not known , yet they are almost certainly present at some level as the underlying angular momentum transport is known to be due to magnetic fields ( see e.g. balbus & hawley 2002 )",
    ". winds ( and jets ) are clearly present in magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations which include these magnetic stresses self consistently . these generically show that the mass loss is stochastic , with large fluctuations both spatially and temporally , but that the time averaged properties are well defined , so this magnetic wind is quasi - continuous ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these calculations are still in their infancy , especially for describing the properties of a geometrically thin disk as appropriate here , so can not yet be used for quantatiative predictions of the wind in the high / soft state . instead , an approximation to the properties of the self - consistent magnetic wind from an accretion disk can be made by imposing an external field geometry ( proga 2000 ; 2003 ) .",
    "the mass loss rates depend on this field configuration , but in general these allow steady , powerful winds to be launched from any radius .",
    "this lack of diagnostic power means that they can be reliably identified only when all other potential mechanisms for a wind are ruled out .",
    "while the physical parameters required for the absorbing material seen in 4u  @xmath0 are somewhat more extreme than produced by the simple analytic estimates of a thermally driven wind , they seem to be potentially within the range of composite thermal / radiation pressure driven winds if @xmath466 .",
    "unfortunately there are no firm estimates for the distance and black hole mass for 4u  @xmath0 , and thus the eddington ratio ( @xmath467@xmath468 ) is hard to constrain .",
    "neither are there any directly applicable simulations of these winds , and how their properties might change with @xmath469 decreasing by a factor 1.7 .",
    "hence there is no unambiguous requirement for magnetic driving from these data .",
    "nonetheless , this wind is clearly very similar in properties ( though with a slightly higher ionization state ) to that that seen in a similar high / soft state from another black hole , gro j1655 - 40 , where @xcite inferred a very small launching radius from the chandra grating data requiring a magnetic wind . given the continuity of properties seen between the wind in 4u  @xmath0 and gro  j@xmath9 then it seems likely that if the wind in gro  j@xmath9 is magnetically driven , then this process is important also in the 4u  @xmath0 absorber examined here .",

    "<S> we present the results of six suzaku observations of the recurrent black hole transient 4u  @xmath0 during its decline from outburst from february 8 to march 23 in 2006 . </S>",
    "<S> all observations show the typical high / soft state spectral shape in the 250  kev band , roughly described by an optically thick disk spectrum in the soft energy band plus a weak power - law tail that becomes dominant only above @xmath120  kev . </S>",
    "<S> the disk temperature decreases from 1.4  kev to 1.2  kev as the flux decreases by a factor 2 , consistent with a constant radius as expected for disk - dominated spectra . </S>",
    "<S> all the observations reveal significant absorption lines from highly ionized ( h - like and he - like ) iron k@xmath2 at 7.0  kev and 6.7  kev . </S>",
    "<S> the brightest datasets also show significant but weaker absorption structures between 7.8  kev and 8.2  kev , which we identify as a blend of iron k@xmath3 and nickel k@xmath2 absorption lines . </S>",
    "<S> the energies of these absorption lines suggest a blue shift with an outflow velocity of @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> like k@xmath2 line increases from 7  ev to 20  ev . </S>",
    "<S> thus the ionization state of the material decreases , as expected from the decline in flux . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the profiles with voigt functions ( curve of growth ) to derive absorbing columns , then use these together with detailed photo - ionization calculations to derive physical parameters of the absorbing material . </S>",
    "<S> the data then constrain the velocity dispersion of the absorber to 200@xmath6 , and the size of the plasma as @xmath7 assuming a source distance of 10  kpc . </S>"
