    "the large experimental collaborations @xcite in neutrino oscillation physics have successfully used effective two - flavor neutrino oscillation formulas in their analyzes in order to determine the fundamental neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "however , we now know that there exists ( at least ) three active neutrino flavors in nature , which , in principle , means that the analyzes have to be carried out using three - flavor neutrino oscillation formulas .",
    "thus , it is important to carefully examine the effective two - flavor formulas in order to determine their validity in different situations , especially since neutrino oscillation physics has now entered the era of precision measurements .",
    "for example , the super - kamiokande @xcite , sno @xcite , k2k @xcite , and kamland @xcite collaborations have significantly pinned down the errors on the fundamental parameters and future results of the above mentioned experiments as well as other long - baseline experiments will continue to decrease the uncertainties of these parameters .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the presence of matter can result in large alterations in the behavior of neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "an example of this is the mikheyev  smirnov ",
    "wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite , which is the most plausible description of the oscillations of solar electron neutrinos into neutrinos of different flavors .",
    "the matter effects are proportional to the energy of the neutrinos as well as the matter density .",
    "thus , for large neutrino energy and dense matter , the matter effects become important .",
    "note that , in ref .",
    "@xcite , approximate mappings between the three - flavor neutrino parameters in vacuum and matter have been obtained .",
    "in addition , in refs .",
    "@xcite , exact treatments of three - flavor neutrino oscillations in constant matter density have been performed , whereas , in refs .",
    "@xcite , different analytic approximations of three - flavor neutrino oscillation probability formulas have been investigated for both constant and varying matter density .    in this letter",
    ", we study the matter effects on neutrino mixing and oscillations in the limit where the matter density becomes infinite and the resulting neutrino oscillation probabilities are actual two - flavor formulas .",
    "we also investigate how well these two - flavor formulas reproduce the actual neutrino oscillation probabilities when neutrinos propagate through matter with large , but not infinite , matter density .",
    "with three neutrino flavors , there are six fundamental parameters which influence neutrino oscillations , two mass squared differences ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , three mixing angles ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) , and one _ cp_-violating phase ( @xmath5 ) . for the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath6 , we adopt the standard parameterization given in ref .  @xcite . in addition , we introduce the mass hierarchy parameter @xmath7 as well as the parameter @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the neutrino energy .",
    "we also use the abbreviations @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .    in some special cases ,",
    "it is possible to write one or more of the neutrino oscillation probabilities as effective two - flavor formulas , _",
    "i.e. _ , the probabilities can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the probability of the transition @xmath16 , @xmath17 defines the oscillation amplitude , @xmath18 defines the oscillation frequency , and @xmath19 is the length of the path travelled by the neutrinos . in the case of three - flavor neutrino oscillations in vacuum ,",
    "the survival probability @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 this probability takes the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2flav ] ) if any of the elements @xmath22 of the leptonic mixing matrix or any of the mass squared differences equals zero .",
    "the same argument holds for the neutrino oscillation probability @xmath15 .",
    "if one of the conditions is satisfied , then the leptonic mixing matrix can be made real and there is no _ cp_-violation in neutrino oscillations ( majorana phases , which do not influence neutrino oscillations , could still be present if neutrinos are majorana particles ) . in that case ,",
    "the neutrino oscillation probability is given by @xmath23 note that if @xmath24 , then only the oscillations involving the neutrino flavor @xmath25 will become effective two - flavor cases .",
    "the two - flavor cases mentioned above are realized if we make either of the approximations @xmath26 or @xmath27 , see table [ tab:2flav ] for amplitudes and frequencies .",
    "these approximations can be used when analyzing neutrino oscillation experiments neglecting matter effects , for example , the oscillations of electron anti - neutrinos of reactor experiments such as kamland @xcite ( @xmath28 ) and oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos in experiments such as super - kamiokande @xcite ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "@xmath30 & @xmath31 +   + @xmath32 & @xmath33 & @xmath0 + @xmath34 & @xmath35 & @xmath0 + @xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath0 +   + @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 + @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath40 +    the above argument also holds for neutrinos propagating through matter of constant density if exchanging the fundamental neutrino parameters for their effective counterparts in matter .",
    "this gives us another important two - flavor case , namely the limit of an effective matter potential approaching infinity , where all neutrino oscillation probabilities reduce to the two - flavor form of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2flav ] ) .",
    "the remainder of this letter is devoted to study this limit in detail .",
    "in matter , the hamiltonian of three flavor neutrino evolution consists of two parts , the kinematic term @xmath43 and the interaction term @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the fermi coupling constant , and @xmath47 is the electron number density , resulting from coherent forward - scattering of neutrinos .",
    "when @xmath48 , the term @xmath49 can be thought of as a perturbation to the term @xmath50 .",
    "since @xmath50 has two degenerate eigenvectors , we can use degenerate perturbation theory to find approximate eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the total hamiltonian .",
    "the degenerate sector of @xmath50 is spanned by @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in this sector , the hamiltonian is of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 depend on the fundamental neutrino parameters as well as the effective matter potential @xmath57 and the neutrino energy @xmath9 .    in the case of two - flavor neutrino oscillations in vacuum , the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath58 where @xmath18 and @xmath59 are the mass squared difference and mixing angle in the two - flavor scenario , respectively . defining @xmath60 as the effective mixing angle in the degenerate sector of @xmath50 and @xmath61 as the effective mass squared difference , by comparing eqs .",

    "it should be noted that if the absolute value of the fundamental parameter @xmath70 and the effective parameter @xmath61 were to be measured ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath61 determined in an experiment where the matter is extremely dense and @xmath71 is determined by vacuum or close to vacuum experiments ) , then the quotient @xmath72 could provide valuable information on the mass hierarchy ( _ i.e. _ , the sign of @xmath67 ) and the leptonic mixing angle @xmath4 .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that for @xmath73 ( normal mass hierarchy ) , there exists a value of @xmath4 such that @xmath74 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : effparam ] , we plot the effective neutrino parameters in matter as a function of the product @xmath75 .     for a normal mass hierarchy with the vacuum parameters @xmath76 ev@xmath77 , @xmath78 ev@xmath77 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82.,width=245 ]    for neutrinos at large values of @xmath75 , the effective mixing angles @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where the tilde denotes that these are the effective matter parameters , do not play a very important role , since @xmath85 when @xmath86 .",
    "instead , in this case , the important mixing angle is the mixing between the first and second eigenstates , which for @xmath87 becomes dependent on the the effective mixing angles @xmath83 and @xmath84 , as well as the effective phase @xmath88 , this angle is clearly the angle @xmath60 .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : effparam ] , we may consider essentially three different regions for the parameter @xmath75 .",
    "the first region is @xmath89 , where the fundamental neutrino parameters are essentially equal to the vacuum parameters , the second region is @xmath48 , where @xmath90 is essentially an eigenstate to the hamiltonian and there is two - flavor neutrino mixing between @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the last region is the region inbetween the other two , where resonance phenomena occur . in general , the results for an inverted mass hierarchy are similar to those of a normal mass hierarchy .",
    "observe that for atmospheric neutrinos passing through the earth with a characteristic energy of @xmath93 gev , the product @xmath75 is typically in the upper part of the resonance region in which none of the effective mass squared differences , nor any of the effective mixing angles , are small .",
    "this effect , which is studied in , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ( for a recent study , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , should be taken into account when analyzing data from atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "the accuracy of the two - flavor approximation in the limit @xmath94 is dependent on how close the leptonic matter mixing angle @xmath95 is to @xmath96 , or in other words , the value of @xmath97 .",
    "the correction to @xmath98 is given by @xmath99 in first order non - degenerate perturbation theory ( which can be used , since @xmath90 is a non - degenerate eigenstate of @xmath50 ) , where @xmath100 is the @xmath101-@xmath67 element of @xmath49 . from this calculation",

    "is the fact that if @xmath4 is large , then @xmath126 will approach @xmath96 slowly when @xmath127 compared to when @xmath4 is small , see eq .",

    "[ fig : rel7 ] and [ fig : rel3 ] , one should keep in mind that the @xmath91 survival probability @xmath110 is larger for @xmath112 km / 50 gev than for @xmath125 km / 50 gev and that we have plotted the relative accuracy of the approximation .",
    "the reason why the two - flavor neutrino approximation @xmath127 seems to be a good approximation even for small values of @xmath75 when @xmath4 is small has to do with the fact that for small values of @xmath105 and @xmath63 , this approximation gives an error which is of the order @xmath130 to the @xmath131 dependence of the probability @xmath110 when making a series expansion in the quantity @xmath105 .    presently , the number of experiments in which the approximation of @xmath94 can be justified is somewhat limited .",
    "one such example could be a neutrino factory setup with a `` magic '' baseline ( @xmath132 km ) @xcite with a neutrino energy of about 50 gev .",

    "even though the real earth matter density profile is not constant , the @xmath86 approximation should be at least as good as for the case of a constant matter density corresponding to the lowest density of the earth matter density profile .",
    "the approximation has no direct application to solar or supernova neutrinos for which there is a larger @xmath57 than that given by the earth .",
    "this is due to the fact that these situations are well - described by adiabatic evolution and that the neutrino energies are lower than in the case of a neutrino factory",
