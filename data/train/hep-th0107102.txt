    "little string theory ( lst ) is a non - local theory defined on the world volume of ns5-branes in the limit of vanishing string coupling @xmath0 where the string scale @xmath1 is kept fixed @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "this theory does not include dynamical gravity and in the ir flows to six - dimensional yang - mills theory .",
    "nonetheless , lst is quite different from a local field theory : it exhibits t - duality in toroidal compactifications and a hagedorn density of states at very high energy  both the intrinsic attributes of the `` standard '' string theories .",
    "the latter property in particular implies that the statistical mechanics of lst breaks down at a finite temperature , known as the hagedorn temperature .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to better understand the ultraviolet thermodynamics of the lst .",
    "a classical thermodynamics of the lst on the world volume of flat ns5 branes can be easily deduced from its holographic dual , realized as a near horizon geometry of non - extremal ns5 branes @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that as the number @xmath2 of the five - branes is large , @xmath3 , and the energy @xmath4 above extremality in string unites satisfies @xmath5 , the background geometry is smooth with small curvatures everywhere ; in addition , the string perturbation theory is also good as the dilaton is bounded from above by its value at the horizon , @xmath6 .",
    "ignoring loop / stringy corrections , one finds that the hawking temperature of the resulting black hole is independent of the energy @xmath4 and coincides precisely with the hagedorn temperature @xmath7 of the lst _ h=1t_h=2 .",
    "[ th ] since the can tune the energy and the temperature of the system independently , its equation of state ( in the ultraviolet ) is s=_h e , [ seh ] which leads to an exponential growth of the density of states ( e)~e^_h e. [ ph ] one - loop corrections to the hagedorn density of states of lst were studied in @xcite .",
    "the finite energy corrections to the density of states ( [ ph ] ) were argued to be of the form ( e)~e^ e^_h e(1+o(1e ) ) .",
    "[ pf ] the sign of @xmath8 in ( [ pf ] ) is of uttermost importance as it determines the stability of the thermal ensemble representing lst at high energy .",
    "the explicit calculation of @xcite indicated that @xmath9 is negative implying the negative specific heat and thus the thermal instability of the system . according to authors of @xcite",
    "the instability in question is of stringy origin .",
    "it is represented by a ( massless at tree level ) string mode that winds once around the euclidean time direction , but is supposed to become tachyonic at one - loop level .",
    "an alternative explanation of the instability of the lst at high energy has been advocated in @xcite .",
    "following the conjecture of @xcite that thermodynamic instabilities in field theories should correspond to classical instabilities of the dual spacetime geometry , rangamani proposed @xcite that the supergravity dual to lst at hagedorn temperature suffers from a gregory - laflamme ( gl ) @xcite like instability , thereby causing the thermal ensemble to be unstable . though he did not manage to explicitly demonstrate that the metric fluctuations about the background of interest have indeed a zero frequency mode , that is capable of explaining the origin of the instability , rangamani conjectured that the required mode is the one responsible for the gl instability in the near - extremal ns5-branes claimed in @xcite , that would survive the decoupling limit for the finite temperature lst .    in this paper",
    "we prove the proposal of @xcite and present yet another explicit example advocating the general philosophy of @xcite .",
    "we do not perform the stability analysis near the background representing finite temperature lst realized on flat ns5 branes as suggested in @xcite .",
    "rather , we study large metric deformations and show that the resulting black hole geometries have negative specific heat at the _ classical _ level . recall that in the flat case the temperature of the lst is ( classically ) independent of the energy . by changing the theory in the ir ( say wrapping ns5 branes on a 2-cycle , so that the theory is four dimensional macroscopically ) ,",
    "while preserving the uv characteristics ( having a 2-cycle of a finite size ) , we generically expect that temperature should become energy dependent",
    ". this must definitely be the case , if the deformation induces a phase transition in the ir , so that the deformed geometry is simply singular ( and thus does not make sense ) for sufficiently small energy .",
    "then , by studying the classical thermodynamics of the deformed background at high energy we should be able to deduce @xmath8 in ( [ pf ] ) . specifically , we propose to study the stability issue of lst at high energy from the thermodynamics of large number of type iib ns5 branes wrapping a two - cycle of a resolved conifold .",
    "the relevant extremal solution was discussed in @xcite .",
    "it has @xmath10 susy in four dimensions and exhibits a naked singularity in the ir associated with the chiral symmetry breaking of the dual gauge theory at zero temperature .",
    "the nonextremal deformation of this background was constructed in @xcite .",
    "it was argued there that the naked singularity ( at the extremality ) will be hidden beyond the black hole horizon for sufficiently large energy away from the extremality .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the gravitational background representing a large number of type iib ns5 branes wrapping a 2-cycle in the resolved conifold geometry at finite temperature .",
    "we study thermodynamics of this black hole solution , and show that at high energy the black hole has a negative specific heat .",
    "we analytically compute @xmath8 in the density of states expression ( [ pf ] ) for the discussed deformation .",
    "we briefly conclude in section 3 .",
    "technical details can be found in the appendix .",
    "in the previous section addressing the origin of thermodynamic instability of lst at high energy , we proposed to study large metric deformation of its holographic dual realized by wrapping ns5 branes on a two - sphere of a resolved conifold .",
    "the motivation for choosing this particular background came from the fact that the corresponding extremal solution had a naked singularity in the ir associated with the zero temperature chiral symmetry breaking phase transition of the dual gauge theory .",
    "as the result , the hawking temperature of its nonextremal deformation should be energy dependent , and so the classical analysis should be enough to extract @xmath8 in the `` corrected '' entropy - energy relation s=_h e+e + o(1/e ) .",

    ". the first condition amounts to choosing c = h_0g_h^2 f_0 , [ cdef ] and as we will see insures ( for @xmath29 ) that the dilaton is everywhere small .",

    "[ compal ] note that as in the flat lst case @xcite , @xmath9 is and extensive quantity  it is proportional to the noncompact factor @xmath32 of the fivebrane world - volume . since @xmath8 in ( [ compal ] ) is negative , the black hole ( [ m10 ] ) has negative specific heat and is thus thermodynamically unstable .",
    "the purpose of this paper was to argue that the instability of the ultraviolet lst thermodynamics in its holographic dual is of a supergravity origin , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "to do so , we identified a large metric deformation of the gravity dual to lst where the ( conjectured ) threshold instability of the flat lst dual should be enhanced to classical instability of the nonextremal generalization of the deformed background .",
