    "using field - theoretical methods and renormalization - group ( rg ) analyses we obtain the leading asymptotic behavior of the casimir force at the tricritical point . as a function of the film thickness @xmath2 it has the form of a power law multiplied by a fractional power of a logarithm and by the _ universal _ casimir amplitude .",
