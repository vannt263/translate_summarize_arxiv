    "the two parameters we used to bin , @xmath25 and @xmath2}$]@xmath118 , are primarily estimated from isochrone - fitting on cmd .",
    "stellar parameters estimated from photometry are far less accurate than the ones derived by spectroscopy . on the other hand , some assumptions must be made to constrain the parameter space in the cmd .",
    "here we have assumed all rgb stars have an age of 14 gyr for both gcs and dsphs .",
    "for the dwarf spheroidal galaxies , this assumption is too simple because some dsphs are known to have extended star formation histories compared with gcs ( harris 2001 ; puzia 2003 ; harris et al .",
    "sculptor and sextans are dominated by old populations ( orban et al .",
    "2008 ) , which should show observational properties similar to galactic globular clusters . however , shetrone et al .  ( 2003 ) proved that sculptor has a spread in age of at least 4 gyr .",

    "lianou et al .",
    "( 2011 ) demonstrated that the assumption of old ages for rgb stars in dwarf satellite galaxies leads to a bias toward metal - poor estimates if the ages of the stars are lower , as is possibly the case for fornax and leo  ii .",
    "the ages of stars are always difficult to estimate , although one technique is based on using the spectroscopic metallicity , and then measuring the age using photometry ( kgs08 ) .    in this work ,",
    "the age affect is not enough to highly bias our results , despite the age - spread in dsphs . in order to test the impact of age ,",
    "we have tried three ages in our photometric metallicity determination , 7 gyr , 9 gyr , and 14 gyr , and we found no significant difference in these ages .",
    "then we choose 14 gyr to set to all the test rgb stars and make comparison of metallicity derived from co - added spectra and isochrone - fitting photometrically for gcs and dsphs , as figure  [ fig : fehcompphot ] shows .",
    "there is a good reason , however , that @xmath30}$}_{\\rm phot}$ ] is less than @xmath30}$}_{\\rm coadd}$ ] for fornax .",
    "the average age is significantly younger than 14 gyr , which means the rgb stars are bluer than the 14 gyr isochrone .",

    "the uncertainty in @xmath2}$]@xmath83 may affect the results if @xmath2}$]@xmath83 is significantly different from @xmath2}$ ]  determined by spectroscopy .",
    "however , binning by @xmath2}$]@xmath83 is still efficient , and figure  [ fig : fehcomp ] shows that the span of metallicities derived from stars binned by @xmath2}$]@xmath83 covers a larger range than the one binned by @xmath25 , meaning that we would most likely discover extremely metal - poor stars by this way in more distant stellar systems .",
    "these intrinsic extremely metal - poor stars play a crucial role in chemical evolution of these satellite galaxies and accretion history of galactic stellar halo ( tolstoy et al .",
    "2001 ; helmi et al .",
    "2006 ; kirby et al .",
    "2008b ) .",
    "in the parameter space , the residuals of abundance binned by @xmath123 span a larger range , as shown in figure  [ fig : teff ] and figure  [ fig : logg ] , illustrating that these rgb stars are very sensitive to @xmath25 and show a larger variance with parameters such as s / n , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , the standard deviations of distributions show that chemical abundances determined by @xmath2}$]@xmath83-binned stars are tighter and similar to the weighted average abundances .",
    "the outliers in the @xmath25-binned stars are expected to induce the main source of the large scatter . in the future",
    ", we expect to combine these two parameters together , and to explore the impact of relationship between ages , photometric @xmath25 and @xmath26 and metallicity on binning stars .",

    "in this paper we present a method for spectral coaddition of medium resolution spectra for detailed measurements of multi - element abundances .",
    "our method overcomes the low s / n and weak spectral features of distant rgb stars by co - adding spectra of similar rgb stars .",
    "we impose a surface gravity restriction ( @xmath124 ) for rgb stars in gcs and dsphs in order to enhance the quality of spectra . we group stars in two ways , using photometric effective temperature estimates and photometric metallicity estimates , and then we determine detailed chemical abundances ( @xmath2}$ ] , @xmath3}$ ] , @xmath4}$ ] , @xmath5}$ ] , @xmath6}$ ] ) with elemental masks on the whole spectrum .",
    "we use more than 1300 well studied individual rgb stars from 8 gcs and 8 dsphs in the milky way to test the feasibility and accuracy of this method .",
    "this work can briefly be summarized as follows .",
    "first , we determine effective temperature , surface gravity and iron abundance by an isochrone - fitting technique on the cmd for individual rgb stars in our sample , then set these parameters as initial values for the following selection of synthetic spectra for each observed one and the chemical abundance comparisons .",
    "then , individual chemical abundances for all rgb stars have been determined and compare well with previous results ( kgs08 ; kirby et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "second , we make a cut ( @xmath125 ) on candidate rgb stars so that our resulting sample is a good match to the m31 red giant stars to which we aim to apply this spectral co - addition method",
    ". then the candidate stars were binned using two photometric parameters , effective temperature and metallicity .",
    "the science spectra belonging to one bin were added together , weighted by the inverse variance within specific elemental masks on the pixel level .",
    "we also selected a synthetic spectrum for each observed spectrum in each bin based on its photometric effective temperature and photometric surface gravity .",
    "the selected synthetic spectra have the same metallicity and @xmath0-element abundances for each bin .",
    "then , we added these synthetic candidate spectra together with the same weights as we used for the observed ones .",
    "third , we used the levenberg - marquardt algorithm to select the best fitting co - added synthetic spectrum for the co - added observed one by minimizing @xmath126 between synthetic one and observed one for whole spectrum on a pixel - to - pixel level in several iteratively steps . for each bin",
    "we determine each elemental abundance , @xmath2}$ ] , @xmath3}$ ] , @xmath4}$ ] , @xmath5}$ ] , @xmath6}$ ] , separately .",
    "only one element was considered in each run excluding bias probably induced by unavailable element abundances of individual stars .",
    "fourth , we combined individual abundances in each bin weighted almost the same way as we performed to the co - added spectra , to get the weighted average abundances , and then we carried out comparisons with co - added abundances .",
    "the co - added abundances agree reasonably well with the expected values from the weighted average abundances .",
    "fifth , for @xmath44 versus @xmath30}$}_{\\rm phot}- \\rm based$ ] binning scenarios , the abundance comparison and difference plots look similar for the two scenarios .",
    "this means the abundance errors are dominated by factors other than the spread of absorption line strength within a bin . for metal poor stars the rgb isochrones are really vertical",
    "so the two binning scenarios result in similar groups of stars .",
    "we prefer the @xmath30}$}_{\\rm phot}$ ] based binning scenario since our co - addition scenario for synthetic spectra can account for a spread in @xmath127 within a bin , but not for a spread in @xmath2}$ ]  or @xmath10}$ ] .",
    "last , the precision of the abundances measured from co - added mrs does not appear to be a strong function of s / n over the range we have explored : co - added spectral @xmath128 for gcs ( see figure  [ fig : sngc ] ) and @xmath129 for dsphs ( see figure  [ fig : sn ] ) . the s / n of the individual m31 rgb spectra to which we plan to apply this co - addition method is typically much lower than that of the individual spectra analyzed in this paper , but many more stars are co - added together in the m31 bins so that the s / n of the co - added m31 rgb spectra are expected to be comparable to that of the co - added spectra used here ( kirby et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the comparisons of metallicity and @xmath0 elements derived from the degraded spectra with s / n comparable to rgb stars of m31 satellite galaxies and weighted average results demonstrate the feasibility of this technique .    we conclude that we can safely apply this method of spectral coaddition to analyze chemical abundance patterns in m31 satellite galaxies using medium resolution spectra of rgb stars",
