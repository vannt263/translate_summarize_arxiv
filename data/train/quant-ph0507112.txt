    "quantum control is a very topical issue which bears relevance to many different fields of contemporary physics and chemistry , such as molecular dynamics in laser fields and quantum optics @xcite .",
    "a few examples of control of the quantum state by adiabatic transport @xcite , by unitary evolution @xcite or by conditional measurements @xcite have been already proposed for the particular quantum system of atoms interacting with quantized electromagnetic field in a single - mode resonator .    in parallel , a theoretical framework of quantum control has been built up .",
    "four different types of problems have been identified in the literature @xcite : the control of pure state , the control of density matrix , the control of observable and , finally , the control of the evolution operator",
    ". each of these problems can be formulated in the same way : the goal is to impose on the considered characteristics an arbitrarily chosen value .    to achieve a control objective",
    ", one has to perturb the system , since its natural evolution usually results in too restrictive a dynamics .",
    "the control hamiltonian @xmath1 thus comprises the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath2 as well as @xmath3 hamiltonians of the form @xmath4 , which stand for the interaction hamiltonians of the system with @xmath3 classical fields of controllable amplitudes @xmath5 , @xmath6 the functions @xmath7 play the role of the control parameters one has to adjust in order to achieve the desired control process .",
    "any problem of control can thus be put in the following form : for a given physical system , specified by @xmath2 and @xmath8 , find the values of the control parameters @xmath7 which ensure that a specific characteristics of the system ( quantum state , density matrix , observable , evolution operator ) will take an arbitrarily prescribed value .",
    "not all the objectives are always feasible . for example",
    ", the unitarity of the evolution operator for closed systems prevents the eigenvalues of the density matrix from changing through a hamiltonian process of control .",
    "this kind of constraints is often referred to as _ kinematical constraints _ @xcite .",
    "but there also exist _ dynamical constraints _ which stem from the algebraic properties of the hamiltonians @xmath9 . indeed , the evolution operator @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the chronological product , belongs to the lie group obtained by the exponentiation of the lie algebra generated by the operators @xmath12 .",
    "the feasibility of a particular problem of control in a specific physical situation , defined by the hamiltonians @xmath13 , is clearly related to the properties of this algebra . for example , if one wants to completely control the evolution operator of a quantum system , _",
    "i.e. _ to be able to give the operator @xmath14 any prescribed value , one must perturb the system in such a way that the operators @xmath12 generate the whole lie algebra @xmath15 which provides , through exponentiation , the whole lie group @xmath16 @xcite ( this prescription is called the bracket generation condition ) .",
    "necessary mathematical conditions also exist for the other types of control problems which can be found in the literature @xcite : these conditions are obviously weaker than the previous one , since the controllability of the evolution operator automatically implies all the other ones .",
    "the feasibility of a control problem can thus be decided through mathematical criteria established in the context of the lie group theory .",
    "but the explicit values of the control parameters achieving the desired control objective still remain to be found . in other words ,",
    "once the existence of a solution has been proved , one still has to find it explicitly . to achieve this goal , different methods , such as optimal control @xcite ,",
    "have been proposed , most of which rely either on a known or intuitively guessed particular solution which can be further optimized with respect to a given cost functional , through variational schemes @xcite .",
    "a purely algebraic approach @xcite , based on the decomposition of the arbitrary desired evolution on the lie group , is also possible , but rapidly leads to intractable computations as the dimension of the state space increases .    in the context of the control of the evolution operator ,",
    "a constructive method called nonholonomic control @xcite was proposed , in the same spirit as in @xcite : this method is fundamentally algebraic but also uses optimization steps .",
    "the physical idea is to alternately apply two distinct well chosen perturbations @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( _ i.e. _ two perturbations which check the bracket generation condition ) .",
    "the timings of the interaction pulses play the role of control parameters and are determined by solving the inverse floquet problem . the convergence of the algorithm results from an unsuspected simplification which emerges from the random matrix theory .",
    "indeed , it relies on the algebraic properties of the @xmath19 roots of the identity matrix , the spectra of which resemble those of random unitary matrices which are ruled by the dyson distribution law .",
    "this method , combined with a generalization of the quantum zeno effect , has also led to coherence protection schemes @xcite .",
    "the nonholonomic technique is completely universal and can thus be applied to any physical system . in the last few years",
    ", cold atomic rydberg states have appeared as particularly relevant in the context of quantum information , and have been widely investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose to consider a real system composed of two cold cesium ( cs ) atoms interacting via dipolar forces and prepared in rydberg states . under some physical assumptions , the hilbert space of the system",
    "is restricted to four states , as for a two qubit system .",
    "we then propose a control experiment employing a pulsed electric field which allows us to impose a @xmath0 gate to the system through nonholonomic control . even though we have tried to propose a realistic experimental setting , the simplifications we have made result in serious limitations of the scheme we present .",
    "nevertheless , it shows how the nonholonomic method can work on a real physical system and suggests that this technique can be an effective way to solve real - life problems of control .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we recall briefly the main features of the nonholonomic control technique . in sec.iii , we describe our physical application in detail - the system , the control hamiltonians , the calculated control parameters - and discuss its validity and limitations .",
    "let us consider an @xmath20-dimensional quantum system of unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "our goal is to control its evolution operator @xmath21 , _",
    "i.e. _ to be able to achieve any arbitrary evolution @xmath22 .",
    "[ ptb ]    cnotfig1.eps    to this end , we alternately apply two physical perturbations , of hamiltonians @xmath17 and @xmath18 , during @xmath23 time intervals ( pulses ) , the timings of which are denoted by @xmath24 ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 correspond to the beginning and the end of the control sequence , respectively ) .",
    "the control hamiltonian takes the following pulsed shape ( cf fig .",
    "[ fig1]):@xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35,$ ] where @xmath36 .",
    "the total evolution operator is therefore @xmath37 where we have implicitly assumed that @xmath20 is even .",
    "our control problem can thus be translated into the following form : given an arbitrary unitary operator @xmath38 we want to find a time vector @xmath39 with non - negative entries , such that @xmath40    as we said previously , for a solution to exist the operators @xmath41 must generate the whole lie algebra @xmath15 .",
    "this prescription can be checked directly as long as the dimension @xmath20 is not too big : one simply computes the commutators of all orders of @xmath42 and @xmath43 and stops as soon as they generate @xmath15 .",
    "but when @xmath20 becomes large , direct computation is intractable . in that case",
    ", one can simply check the following sufficient conditions , suggested by v.g .",
    "kac @xcite , according to which the system becomes nonholonomic , that is completely controllable , when the representative matrix of @xmath44 in the eigenbasis of @xmath45 has no zero elements and vice versa , and also the eigenvalues and their pairwise differences are distinct for both matrices",
    ".    once the previous criterion is checked , one has to compute the time vector @xmath46 solution of eq.([pbcont ] ) .",
    "the method consists in determining the time vector @xmath47 such that @xmath48 then iteratively approaching the time vector @xmath46 through a newton - like technique .",
    "the straightforward way to compute @xmath47  would be to minimize the functional @xmath49 with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "however , @xmath50 presents many local minima which make its optimization uneasy . yet",
    ", there exists an alternative method based on the algebraic properties of the @xmath19 roots of the identity matrix .",
    "the idea is to look for @xmath20 parameters @xmath51 such that @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a non - degenerate @xmath19 root of the identity matrix , _",
    "i.e. _ a matrix of the form @xmath54{cccc}% 1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0\\\\ 0 & e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{n } } & \\cdots & 0\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\cdots & e^{i\\left (   n-1\\right )   \\frac{2\\pi}{n}}% \\end{array } \\right ]   \\cdot\\widehat{m},\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is a unitary matrix . to compute the @xmath56 s",
    ", we use the following algebraic property : if @xmath57 denotes the characteristic polynomial of a unitary matrix @xmath14 , then @xmath58 and the equality is achieved if and only if @xmath14  is an @xmath19 root of the identity matrix , up to a global phase factor .    to obtain",
    "the @xmath56 s , one thus computes the characteristic polynomial @xmath59 of the matrix product @xmath60 and minimizes the function @xmath61 to @xmath62 with respect to the @xmath56 s .",
    "this minimization turns to be quite easy , due to the fact that a generic unitary matrix is very close to an @xmath19 root of the identity .",
    "in fact , numerical work shows that in about 30% cases of randomly chosen timings @xmath63 the standard steepest descent algorithm immediately finds the global minimum @xmath64 .",
    "this fact has roots in the random matrix theory @xcite . indeed , according to dyson s law ,",
    "the eigenvalues of random unitary matrices tend to repel each other , and are thus very likely to be almost regularly distributed on the unit circle , as those of an @xmath19 root of the identity , as shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "in other words , in the space of @xmath65 unitary matrices , the @xmath53 matrices are present in abundance , and can be reached from a randomly chosen point by small variation of the timings .    finally , we define the time vector @xmath47 corresponding to the identity matrix by simple repetition of @xmath63 @xmath66 and checks that indeed @xmath67 up to an irrelevant global phase factor .",
    "we now have to iteratively determine the time vector @xmath46 from @xmath47 .",
    "let us first consider the case of a target evolution close to the identity : in that case , @xmath68 can be written in the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is an @xmath71 bounded ( @xmath72 ) dimensionless hermitian hamiltonian , and @xmath73 a small parameter .",
    "we then calculate the variations @xmath74 , which are determined to first order in @xmath75 by the linear equations @xmath76 once @xmath77 has been calculated through standard techniques of linear algebra , we replace @xmath47  by @xmath78 and repeat the same operation until we obtain @xmath46 which checks @xmath79 at the desired accuracy .",
    "if the evolution @xmath80 is not close to the identity , that is , if @xmath75 is not small , one has to divide the work into elementary paths on which the previous method converges . to this end",
    ", we consider an integer @xmath81 such that @xmath82 is attainable from @xmath83 through our iterative algorithm , and determine in this way the associated time vector @xmath84  which checks @xmath85 taking @xmath86 as our new target , we repeat the same algorithm to compute @xmath87 such that @xmath88 and so on .",
    "we progress in this way as long as the algorithm converges : in general , it stops at a value @xmath89 , for which eq.([eqlin ] ) has no solution . then",
    ", we keep the time vector @xmath90 and simply repeat the same control sequence @xmath91 times to achieve the desired evolution @xmath92 ^{n^{\\ast } } & = & \\widehat{u}_{arbitrary}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to conclude this section , let us point out that another equivalent form of the nonholonomic control method exists , in which the durations of the pulses are fixed , whereas the strengths of the perturbations play the role of control parameters .",
    "the equations in that case are very similar to those we have just dealt with , and the same method applies with almost no change . for more details , see @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present the application of our control technique to a system of cold cs atoms .",
    "frozen rydberg gases of interacting cs atoms have been investigated in @xcite and have revealed the existence of new phenomena typical of low temperatures , such as the modification of resonance profiles , the explanation of which requires the framework of a @xmath20 body theory .",
    "the system we have chosen to consider in this paper is greatly inspired by the experimental situation studied in @xcite : it consists in two cs atoms in rydberg states , denoted by @xmath93 and @xmath94 , of dipole momenta @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , linked by the fixed vector @xmath97 which is determined by its norm , taken equal to @xmath98 ( of the same order as the distance between two close neighbour atoms in @xcite ) , and its direction @xmath99 , defined by polar angles @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( cf fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "these two atoms are coupled by dipole - dipole interaction @xmath102\\ ] ] and are subject to a stark field @xmath103 , the @xmath104 axis corresponding to the quantization axis for the total angular momentum .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system is thus composed of the unperturbed part , @xmath105 , and the controllable perturbation @xmath106 .    at this stage , we shall make two remarks .",
    "firstly , for the dipole - dipole approximation of the interaction energy to hold , _",
    "i.e. _ for higher order terms to be actually negligible , the distance @xmath107 between atoms must be much greater than the sum of the radii of the atoms , which is not strictly the case here : indeed , in the atomic rydberg states we shall consider ( @xmath108 ) , the two atoms have almost the same radius , approximately equal to @xmath109 , whence the prescription @xmath110 is not rigorously checked . to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", one could be tempted to increase the value of the interatomic distance @xmath107 , but this would result in a decrease of the typical value of the dipole - dipole interaction which would then become much smaller than the typical value of the stark interaction energy : this has to be avoided for our purpose of control , and the balance between the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath111 and the perturbation @xmath106 must be preserved .",
    "one might then suggest to decrease the stark field in order to make the stark interaction term decrease and follow the dipole - dipole interaction , but then the range of the required values for the stark field would not be realistic .",
    "we choose instead to keep the value of @xmath98 and to consider the dipole - dipole term only , bearing in mind that a more rigorous approach should take higher order effects into account .",
    "secondly , contrary to the experimental situation described in @xcite , we do not deal with a sample of @xmath20 interacting cs atoms but only with a two atom system .",
    "nevertheless , it has been demonstrated that this situation could be experimentally achieved @xcite .",
    "[ ptb ]    let us now describe the control operation we want to achieve .",
    "initially in zero field , the system is prepared in an arbitrary superposition @xmath112 of the following four states @xmath113 which formally stands for two qubits of information to be processed .",
    "our goal is to impose the @xmath0 gate , or , in other words , whichever the initial state @xmath114 is , we want to impose the particular evolution @xmath0 , yielding the final state @xmath115 let us underline that the choice of this specific gate is purely arbitrary : we could have chosen any other unitary evolution of the system .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath0 gate is particularly important since it enters into the composition of universal sets of quantum gates , as demonstrated by d.p .",
    "divincenzo in his well - known paper @xcite .    the control sequence which allows us to achieve this objective roughly consists in alternately and diabatically ( _ i.e. _ abruptly ) applying the two different values @xmath116 and @xmath117 of the stark field to the system",
    ", corresponding to two different values @xmath118 and @xmath44 of the total hamiltonian , during pulses the durations of which will be determined through the algorithm described in the previous section .",
    "from now on , we shall make the two following physical assumptions on the system : ( _ i _ ) the states @xmath119 and @xmath120 are not mixed with the stark multiplicities @xmath121 ( this assumption is motivated by the position of the avoided crossings , which are far from the values @xmath122 and @xmath123 of the applied field ) ; ( _ ii _ ) the states @xmath124 and @xmath125 remain unaltered ( we neglect their mixing with @xmath126 states , which is correct up to @xmath127 ) , while their energies decrease linearly with the amplitude of the applied field . according to these simplifications , the spectrum of our system in a static electric field can be represented as shown on fig.[fig4 ] : the energies of the states @xmath128 and @xmath129 vary linearly with the applied field ( with the same slope @xmath130 atomic units ) , while the energy of the state @xmath131 remains constant ; moreover , for the resonance fields @xmath132 , we have @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .    [ ptb ]    in the basis @xmath136 , the total hamiltonian takes thus the following expression @xmath137{cccc}% 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\gamma(e - e_{1 } ) & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\gamma(e - e_{2 } ) & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\gamma(e - e_{3 } ) \\end{array } \\right )   , \\ ] ] which will alternately take the two distinct values @xmath118 for @xmath138 and @xmath44 for @xmath139 .    in summary",
    ", we deal with a system whose hilbert space is restricted to @xmath140 states , to which we want to apply the @xmath0 gate . to this end",
    ", we propose to alternately apply two hamiltonians @xmath118 and @xmath44 during pulses whose timings @xmath141 are to be determined by the method we presented in the previous section .",
    "what we have to do first is to find the @xmath140 timings @xmath142 which meet eq.([racnid ] ) by minimizing @xmath143 .",
    "using eq.([temps ] ) we then build the @xmath144-dimensional time vector @xmath47 from the @xmath56 s , which achieves the evolution @xmath83 .",
    "then we apply the iterative algorithm described in the previous section .",
    "as the @xmath0 gate is far from the identity matrix , we have to divide the work : we take @xmath145 as our target evolution , where @xmath146 is an integer greater than @xmath147 for which our algorithm converges , providing the time vector @xmath148 ; then we take the new target @xmath149 where @xmath150 and run our algorithm again , yielding the vector @xmath151 , etc . as long as we obtain convergence .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath146 we obtained is @xmath152 , associated with the time vector @xmath153 which achieves the evolution @xmath154 : the desired evolution @xmath0 is obtained by repeating @xmath152 times the same elementary control sequence , defined by @xmath153 .",
    "we thus see that the time vector @xmath155 which achieves @xmath0 is @xmath156-dimensional and can be built by repeating @xmath157 times the vector @xmath153 .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig.[fig5 ] presents the numerical results we obtained for @xmath158 and @xmath159 ( cf fig.[fig3 ] ) which shows the switchings of the stark field on an elementary control sequence , whose duration is @xmath160 . in our calculations",
    ", we tried to remain in a realistic range for the different parameters of our system .",
    "for example , the total control duration , which is of the order of @xmath161 , is much smaller than the lifetime of the rydberg states considered , which is approximately @xmath162 . yet ,",
    "serious problems and limitations arise .",
    "firstly , the required switching time of the stark field is much less than @xmath163 ( some timings are a few @xmath164 ) , which is experimentally very difficult to achieve : this will unavoidably threaten the reliability of the control . to address this problem , one may consider replacing the static control fields by pulsed lasers , as in @xcite , which would probably allow rapid switching times and would certainly be more tractable experimentally .",
    "secondly , the four state system we have considered here is a severe idealization : the couplings between the states @xmath165 can not be ignored .",
    "in addition , the influence on the states @xmath166 and @xmath167 of the multiplicities",
    "@xmath121 has been completely neglected , as well as the mixing of the states @xmath168 with the states @xmath126 .",
    "one can solve these problems by increasing the state space , _ i.e. _ by taking all the states which are actually coupled by the stark field and the dipole - dipole interaction into account : calculating the control time vector becomes much longer , as the system considered is larger , but , fundamentally , the structure of the problem remains the same .",
    "finally , if we do not work with two atoms but rather with a large sample , it might be experimentally very difficult to fix precise values to @xmath169 and @xmath101 : this results again in a loss of reliability of the control . a possible solution to this problem , though not perfect , would be to put the atoms in an optical lattice , which would allow one to control more precisely their spatial arrangement .",
    "another method would be to perform a first control sequence , the goal of which would be to distinguish between  good  and  bad  pairs of atoms : for instance , starting from the state @xmath129 , the ",
    "good  pairs ( _ i.e. _ the pairs with the required vector @xmath170 ) will undergo the cnot gate and will thus end in the state @xmath171 , whereas the other pairs will end in a superposition of all states and could therefore be experimentally distinguished and destroyed .    to conclude this section , we want to emphasize that the limitations discussed above do not remove the pedagogical and demonstrative value of the application presented .",
    "the example considered here shows the operability of the nonholonomic control method and suggests that it can be actually employed to achieve real objectives of control .",
    "in this paper , we first recalled the nonholonomic control technique , which allows one to control the evolution operator of generic quantum systems which meet the bracket generation condition : after putting it in the general framework of quantum control we briefly exposed its main algorithmic features and underlined the fundamental reasons for its convergence . then we suggested a demonstrative application of this scheme to a system of two cold cs atoms , inspired by experimental studies on cold rydberg gases : we showed that through alternately applying two different values of a stark field during @xmath172 pulses , the timings of which range from @xmath173 to @xmath174 , one can impose the @xmath0 gate to two qubits of information stored in four specific states of the system .",
    "finally we discussed the physical validity and the limitations of our application .",
