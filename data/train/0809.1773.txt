    "an algebra with two compatible associative products is a vector space @xmath0 equipped with two binary operations such that each of them is an associative product , and these two products are compatible ( i.e. , any linear combination of these products is again an associative product ) .",
    "such algebras were recently studied by odesskii and sokolov ; in  @xcite , they classified simple finite - dimensional algebras of this type . in this paper",
    ", we study another extreme case : free algebras of this type .",
    "namely , we compute dimensions of graded components of this algebra , and also give an interpretation of operations in terms of combinatorics of planar rooted trees .",
    "just as for an arbitrary algebraic structure , to get information about free algebras , one first computes the @xmath1-module structure ( with respect to the action by permutations of the generators ) on the `` multilinear part '' ( i.e. , the space of elements in which each of the generators occurs exactly once ) of the free algebra with @xmath2 generators . then this information is used in a rather straightforward way to compute the dimensions of all graded components .",
    "as our computation shows , the free @xmath3-generated algebra with two compatible products has catalan numbers as dimensions of its graded components .",
    "we provide a materialisation of this formula , describing two compatible products on planar rooted trees and proving that the algebra of planar rooted trees is a free algebra with two compatible products .",
    "( we actually give a more general construction which is valid for any number of generators . )",
    "we use this construction to obtain yet another proof of the results on the grossman  larson algebra of planar rooted trees .      to compute dimensions and characters for spaces of multilinear elements , we use koszul duality for operads and the theory of koszul operads developed by v.ginzburg and m.kapranov .",
    "it turns out that the koszul dual to the operad of two compatible products is much simpler than the original operad . for any koszul operad , information on the dimensions of its components can be used to obtain similar information for the dual operad .",
    "namely , the following assertion is true .",
    "let @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5 is a koszul operad , then @xmath6    a similar functional equation holds for the generating functions of characters of representations of the symmetric groups in the components of an operad .    for the associative operad @xmath7",
    ", we have @xmath8 , and so @xmath9 .",
    "this operad is koszul and self - dual , which agrees with the functional equation : @xmath10    koszulness of the operad of two compatible products was proved by strohmayer  @xcite , whose result is crucial for this paper . in our study of free algebras over @xmath11 , we also use an elegant result of chapoton which can be used in many cases to prove that some class of algebras consists of free algebras .      throughout the paper , we assume that the reader is familiar with the main notions of operad theory . still we briefly remind the reader of some of them when they appear in the text .    in section  [ koszul ]",
    ", we recall some standard definitions of operad theory , define the operad of two compatible brackets , and list necessary facts about koszul duality for operads . in section  [ chi - calc ] ,",
    "we compute the generating functions for the characters of our operads using functional equations on these generating functions , and use them to identify the corresponding representations . in section  [ monomial ]",
    ", we construct a monomial basis in the multilinear part of the free algebra with two compatible products . in section  [ freealg ]",
    ", we prove that free algebras with two compatible products are free as associative algebras . in section  [ comb - oper ] , we relate compatible associative products to combinatorics of trees .",
    "it turns out that the linear span of planar rooted trees has two compatible associative products , and that the resulting algebra is a free algebra with two compatible products .",
    "we also give another proof of the result of grossman and larson @xcite on the algebra of planar rooted trees .",
    "we conclude with some remarks and conjectural generalisations for other compatible structures .",
    "all vector spaces and algebras throughout this paper are defined over an arbitrary field of zero characteristic .",
    "this paper was inspired by a table - talk at the workshop on algebraic structures in geometry and physics ( leicester , july 2008 ) .",
    "the author is grateful to alexander odesskii for his questions on the operad of compatible associative products , and to andrey lazarev for an opportunity to attend the workshop .",

    "the associativity conditions for both products are pretty transparent ; to show that all the terms in consecutive product @xmath260 appear in the product @xmath261 one should just notice that to obtain the terms in @xmath262 where subtrees of @xmath230 are attached directly to vertices of @xmath263 ( all other terms appear in @xmath264 for tautological reasons ) we should just attach the corresponding subtrees to the root of @xmath231 when computing @xmath248 for @xmath264 , then we can attach them as required when computing the final product .",
    "the same argument works for the second product",
    ".    we shall establish the compatibility condition rewritten in the form @xmath265",
    "the reason is that for our products both the left hand side and the right hand side are combinations of trees with nonnegative coefficients , and we can interpret the summands that appear there in a rather nice and simple way .",
    "namely , the trees that appear on the left hand side are those for which there exist subtrees of @xmath230 that are attached to some leaves of @xmath263 . obviously , the left hand side has the same interpretation .",
    "details are simple and we leave them to the reader .",
    "now we shall prove that the algebra @xmath227 is free as an @xmath11-algebra .",
    "note that this algebra admits a natural grading by the number of non - root vertices of a tree , and the dimensions of graded components are precisely the dimensions of the graded components of the free @xmath11-algebra generated by @xmath224 .",
    "it remains to show that our algebra is generated as an @xmath11-algebra by elements of degree  @xmath3 ; it will follow that it is a quotient of the corresponding free algebra , and since it has the same dimensions of graded components , these two algebras should be isomorphic .",
    "thus , it remains to prove the following lemma .    as an @xmath11-algebra ,",
    "@xmath227 is generated by elements of degree  @xmath3 .",
    "we use induction on degree .",
    "assume that all trees of degree at most @xmath44 are products of elements of degree  @xmath3 .",
    "let us show that the same holds for trees of degree @xmath223 .",
    "for the fixed degree , we use induction on the number of children of the root vertex .",
    "first of all , if the root of a tree has only one child , the label of this child is @xmath266 , and the subtree obtained by forgetting about the root and about the label of the child is @xmath267 , then our tree is @xmath268 , where @xmath266 denotes the tree with two vertices whose non - root vertex is labelled by  @xmath266 , so we can proceed by induction on degree .",
    "assume that the root has at least two children ; then @xmath269 , where the root of @xmath267 has only one child .",
    "let us compute @xmath270 .",
    "this product contains @xmath237 as a summand ; for all other summands the root of the result has fewer children than  @xmath237 ( so we can proceed by induction ) .",
    "theorem [ treefreealg ] can be used to obtain an alternative proof of one of the main results of the article @xcite .",
    "namely , since the first product @xmath248 is the grossman  larson product on @xmath227 , it follows from theorem [ freearefree ] that the grossman  larson algebra of planar rooted trees is a free associative algebra ; moreover , from our proofs it is easy to see that as a generating set of this algebra we can take all trees whose root has only one child .",
    "these are exactly the results of grossman and larson .",
    "define the coproduct @xmath271 by the formula @xmath272}t[i_1]\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot t[i_p]\\otimes t[j_1]\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot t[j_q],\\ ] ] where @xmath233\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot t[k]\\in\\mathbb{q}\\operatorname{rt}(s)$ ] , @xmath273 , @xmath274 .",
    "consider @xmath227 as an associative algebra with respect to either of the products @xmath54 , @xmath55 ( and introduce the product on its tensor square accordingly ) .",
    "then @xmath275 is an algebra homomorphism .",
    "for the first product , this statement is proved in  @xcite . for the second product",
    ", one can use the same proof with some slight modifications ( basically , what should be done is simply forgetting all summands where grafting to leaves occurs ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that although the tensor product of two @xmath11-algebras can be turned into an @xmath11-algebra in many different ways , two products on the tensor square of the free algebra that we just described are not compatible ; the family of products @xmath276 is a pencil of associative products , but it is not a linear pencil anymore ( they rather resemble pencils of associative products from  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the relationship between hopf algebra structure and the structure of an algebra with two compatible products is yet to be clarified .",
    "consider the operad @xmath277 generated by two binary operations @xmath278 and @xmath279 which satisfy the relations @xmath280 then @xmath281 is the operad @xmath282 of duplicial algebras  @xcite , while @xmath283 is the operad @xmath284 .    also , consider the operad @xmath285 generated by two binary operations @xmath286 and @xmath287 which satisfy the relations @xmath288 then @xmath289 is the operad @xmath282 , while @xmath290 is the operad @xmath291 of dendriform algebras  @xcite .",
    "it is known that free algebras over @xmath291 and @xmath282 can be realised by planar trees .",
    "it would be interesting to define in a pure combinatorial way a @xmath292-parameter family of pairs of binary operations @xmath293 and @xmath294 on @xmath227 which have correct specialisations to @xmath295 ( duplicial case ) @xmath121 , @xmath296 ( compatible associative products ) and @xmath297 , @xmath298 ( dendriform case ) .",
    "some general phenomenon that we think is worth mentioning here is the existence of compatible associative products for many other well known algebras where the product is described via combinatorics of trees .",
    "the main idea is very simple .",
    "if the product in the linear span of rooted trees ( planar or not ) is defined for two trees @xmath299\\cdot t_1[2]\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot t_1[k]$ ] and @xmath231 as the sum of all graftings of some type of trees @xmath300 $ ] to vertices of the tree @xmath231 , then another product over all graftings of the same type but only to internal vertices is compatible with the first product . for algebras of planar _",
    "binary _ trees ( which also often occur in literature ) an analogous recipe holds : if a product is defined in terms of graftings , then graftings only to the `` left - going '' leaves produce a compatible product .",
    "consider the connes ",
    "kreimer hopf algebra of renormalisation @xcite , which is a polynomial algebra on ( abstract ) rooted trees , or , in other words , an algebra on the linear span of forests of rooted trees . if we take its dual , and identify the dual of each forest with the rooted tree having all trees of the forest grafted at its root vertex , the coproduct of connes and kreimer yields a product on the linear span of rooted trees which is defined in terms of graftings as above .",
    "thus , this algebra is naturally endowed with another product which is compatible with the original one .    similarly , consider the noncommutative connes",
    " kreimer hopf algebra @xmath301 of foissy  @xcite , which is a free associative algebra on planar rooted trees , or , in other words , an algebra on the linear span of ( ordered ) forests of planar rooted trees .",
    "if we take its dual , and identify the dual of each forest with the planar rooted tree having all trees of the forest grafted at its root vertex , the coproduct of foissy leads to another product on @xmath227 which is again defined in terms of graftings .",
    "it follows that @xmath301 has a natural structure of an algebra with two compatible products .",
    "results of foissy  @xcite on isomorphisms of hopf algebras also produce compatible products on some other algebras on trees , for example , the brouder ",
    "frabetti hopf algebra of renormalization in qed  @xcite .",
    "one can easily check that unlike the case of the grossman ",
    "larson product , the dual of the foissy algebra is not a free algebra with two compatible products ; for example , the @xmath55-subalgebra of @xmath301 generated by elements of degree  @xmath3 ( i.e. , trees with one leaf ) is commutative .",
    "we expect that this is in some sense the only obstruction to freeness .",
    "it is natural to ask which of our results have analogues for other operads of compatible structures ( for the formal definition of compatible @xmath5-structures for any operad  @xmath5 , see @xcite ) .",
    "for the operad of compatible lie brackets , we can prove an exact analogue of theorem [ freearefree ] : free algebras over that operad are free as lie algebras .",
    "the proof is similar to the proof for compatible associative structures and also makes use of an appropriate monomial basis .",
    "we expect that actually both of these statements are particular cases of a very general theorem .      1 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a koszul operad .",
    "then the operad @xmath302 of two compatible @xmath5-structures is also koszul .",
    "if the operad @xmath5 is koszul , then free @xmath302-algebras are free as @xmath5-algebras .",
