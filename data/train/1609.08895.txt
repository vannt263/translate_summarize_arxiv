    "generational structure and its manifestation through fermion masses and mixings is one of the key ingredients of the standard model ( sm ) , however , the origin of flavor remains a puzzle .",
    "while quark flavor solely resides in the yukawa couplings to the higgs , flavor breaking in the lepton sector is even less clear - cut as neutrino masses could stem from a different mechanism .",
    "flavor symmetries explain the observed masses and mixings of the sm fermions , however , viable solutions are not unambiguous .",
    "physics beyond the sm provides opportunities for new insights , as new couplings allow for different combinations of flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "a well - known example is the minimal supersymmetric sm . here",
    "masses and mixings of scalar quarks and leptons are present which allow to probe also non - chiral combinations of matter bilinears @xcite .    here",
    "we consider scalar and vector leptoquark extensions of the sm @xcite .",
    "representations for @xmath8 and renormalizable couplings to sm fermions are given in appendix [ app : l ] .",
    "we assume that proton decay is safe , note , however , to ensure this requires further model - building for some of the leptoquarks @xcite .",
    "there are in total twelve different types of flavor - matrices that appear in leptoquark models with couplings to @xmath9 doublet quarks @xmath10 and leptons @xmath11 , and @xmath9 singlet quarks @xmath12 and charged leptons @xmath13 , schematically , @xmath14 where rows and columns correspond to quarks and leptons , respectively . to simplify the discussion , in the following these couplings",
