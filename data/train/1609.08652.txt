    "giant planets are thought to form either via core - accretion @xcite or gravitational instability scenario @xcite . to get a handle on which formation scenario led to an observed gas giant",
    ", the post - formation entropy of the planet was initially thought to distinguish between the two cases @xcite .",
    "traditionally , planets formed by core accretion were thought to have a low luminosity and entropy ( @xmath09.5 @xmath1/baryon )  corresponding to the so called  cold - start \" scenario  whereas gravitational instability was thought to lead to giant planets having a high luminosity and entropy  the  hot - start \" scenario ( @xmath29.5 @xmath1/baryon , @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies , however , pointed out that the situation is more complex .",
    "the entropy of the planets is affected by whether the accretion of gas onto the planet happens through a supercritical shock front , as indicated by one - dimensional spherically symmetric models @xcite .",
    "if the gas forming the planet passes through such a entropy - reducing shock where a significant part of the accretion luminosity can be radiated , the planet itself will have a low entropy , consistent with the  cold - start \" scenario , regardless which formation mechanism builds the gas giant @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mass of the solid planetary core can alter the post - formation entropy of the planet as well , with higher mass cores leading to hotter planets @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite showed that the presence of a circumplanetary disk around the planet will funnel hot gas to the planet that can inflate the outer layers of the gas giant , enhancing the planet s entropy .",
    "observations of directly imaged planets allow to measure the luminosities of young ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and recently also of still forming embedded planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this makes it possible to estimate their entropies @xcite and conclude whether they are consistent with the `` cold - start '' or  hot - start \" scenarios .",
    "a handful of directly imaged gas giants is available for study today , and most seem to be luminous and consistent @xcite with the  hot - start \" scenario ( which could in principle also be an observational bias as fainter planets are more difficult to detect ) .",
    "however , gravitational instability as a formation mechanism appears unlikely in several of these cases due to various factors , such as the rather small semi - major axis or a rather low circumstellar disk mass @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the luminosity estimations of forming embedded planets from direct imaging observations can be contaminated by the luminosity of the circumplanetary disk or accretion @xcite , enhancing the observed overall luminosity , that can make the planet look like a  hot - start \" case .",
    "the observation that the currently known directly observed planets seem to be consistent with a  hot - start \" scenario , but some of them may formed via core accretion ( e.g. , @xmath3 pic b , @xcite ) indicates that solely the low versus high entropy state of an observed gas giant can not conclusively distinguish between the two planet formation scenario .",
    "this is partially due to the lack of theoretical studies of the thermodynamics of giant planet formation which predict the post - formation entropy based on multi - dimensional , radiation - hydrodynamical simulations .    in this paper",
    "we therefore present a thermodynamical study based on 3d , radiative hydrodynamic simulations of forming gas giants with various masses embedded in circumstellar disks .",
    "the planets form circumplanetary disks or circumplanetary envelopes around them depending on the gas temperature in the planet vicinity @xcite .",
    "as described e.g. in @xcite , the accretion of the gas happens from the vertical direction through the planetary gap .",
    "this is because the top layers of the circumstellar disk try to close the gap opened by the giant planet , and , as gas enters the gap , it falls nearly freely onto the circumplanetary disk s surface and onto the polar regions of the protoplanet .",
    "the gas shocks at this surface , and then becomes the part of the disk , where it eventually spirals down to the planet . in this work",
    "we study the change of important thermodynamic quantities like the entropy or ionization state of the gas as it passes through the shock front .",
    "our study is based on three - dimensional , radiative , grid - based hydrodynamic simulations with the jupiter code @xcite , developed by f. masset & j. szulgyi .",
    "this code is based on a shock - capturing godunov s method using riemann - solvers and has nested meshes , which allow to zoom onto the planet s vicinity with high resolution .",
    "the radiative module is based on the flux limited diffusion approximation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and calculates temperatures where viscous heating and radiative cooling is included .",
    "the opacity of the gas and dust is taken into account through the @xcite opacity table .",
    "this means that despite of the purely gas hydrodynamic simulations , the impact of the dust on the temperature is included through the dust opacities and a fixed dust - to - gas ratio of 1% .",
    "more details about the radiative code and the simulations is given in @xcite and in a future paper for the 3 - 10 @xmath4 gas giants .",
    "here we only mention the most important characteristics .",
    "the coordinate system is spherical , centered onto the star , and covers the entire circumstellar disk radially between 2.0 and 12.4 au with an initial surface density @xmath5 with @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being the semi - major axis , 5.2 au ) .",
    "this density was chosen to be close to the minimum mass solar nebula ( @xcite ) .",
    "only the lower half of the circumstellar ( and circumplanetary ) disks are simulated , assuming symmetry to the disk mid - plane .",
    "the equation of state ( hereafter , eos ) in the code is the ideal gas eos with an adiabatic index @xmath8 equal to 1.43 , such that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the internal energy of the gas ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 is the pressure .",
    "the mean molecular weight is 2.3 , corresponding to the solar value . due to the fixed adiabatic exponent and",
    "mean molecular weight , the ionization and dissociation of hydrogen and helium is not taken into account .",
    "the lack of these mechanisms could alter the predicted temperatures , entropies , and compositions , therefore our computations are only estimates found with an idealized eos . due to the extensive computation time needed for the high - resolution radiative simulations presented here , and due to the limitations of the solver",
    ", we had to use in this work an ideal eos .",
    "we performed simulations with 1 , 3 , 5 , and 10 @xmath4 planets for @xmath13 orbits until steady state has been reached .",
    "a constant kinematic viscosity was applied with value of @xmath14 , where @xmath7 is the semi - major axis , @xmath15is the orbital frequency .",
    "this viscosity corresponds to a value of @xmath16 at 5.2 au . due to the nested meshes centered on the planet , the resolution changes mesh by mesh , with each level of refinement doubling the resolution",
    "this way the highest level of resolution ( reached on level 6 ) was @xmath17au@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the diameter of jupiter . in the simulations the planet is treated as a point - mass in the corner of 8 cells . in other words",
    "there is only a gravitational potential well , no sphere is modeled for the giant planet . the smoothing lengths were  @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath21 au , and @xmath22 au for the 1 , 3 , 5 , and 10 @xmath4 planets , respectively .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , in the 1 @xmath4 simulation the gas is too hot in the planet s vicinity to collapse into a circumplanetary disk . instead , a pressure supported spherical envelope formed around the planet .",
    "in this case , there is no shock front on the surface of the envelope where the vertical influx hits it .",
    "we show the entropies of this simulation for comparison , in order to distinguish between cases with and without supercritical shock fronts .",
    "to estimate the specific entropy ( @xmath23 ) of the gas , we used four different approaches .",
    "all four give the specific entropy based on the pressure and the temperature from the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the first expression we applied is the classical sackur - tetrode entropy formula for @xmath24/he mixture with he mass fraction of 25% @xcite :    @xmath25    this expression does not include ionization / dissociation , such as the eos used in the hydrodynamic code .",
    "the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig::entr ] shows the specific entropy  calculated with the sackur - tetrode expression  on a vertical slice through the 3 @xmath26 planet , zooming to the planet vicinity .",
    "the circumplanetary disk pops out with blue colors , which has clearly lower entropy than the supersonic vertical gas influx ( red - yellow colors ) which feeds the circumplanetary disk .",
    "the minimum entropy can be found in a spherical envelope around the planet , within the inner circumplanetary disk . in fig .",
    "[ fig::entr ] we also show the same vertical cut of the density and a further zoomed - in temperature map in the middle and the right - hand panels , respectively . on the temperature color - map",
    "one can see with bright yellow color part of the razor - sharp shock layer ( the zeldovich spike ) right above the planet and on the surface of the inner circumplanetary disk .",
    "the shock however , is even more extended on the top layer of the circumplanetary disk , based on maps of the mach number .",
    "the temperature just above and below zeldovich spike is identical , meaning that this shock front is super - critical @xcite for all the different mass planets which are forming circumplanetary disks ( 3 - 10 @xmath4 planets ) . in the case of the 1 jupiter - mass simulation , as it was mentioned in the previous section , the circumplanetary gas is too hot to collapse into a disk , therefore an envelope is found ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "due to the extended envelope , the vertical influx does not hit it with large enough velocity ( i.e. subsonically ) to create a shock front on the surface of the envelope .",
    "simulations are the zeldovich spikes at the supercritical shock front .",
    "the gas undergoes a strong entropy reduction ( @xmath27/baryon ) via radiative cooling while passing through the shock . ]",
    "the second eos we used was the saumon - chabrier - van horn eos developed for interiors of giant planets @xcite using the same he / h mass fraction . the third way to calculate the specific entropies was using the cea gibbs minimizer @xcite",
    "this approach , unlike the sackur - tetrode expression , calculates the specific entropy , mean molecular weight , and adiabatic index with the dissociation and ionization of hydrogen and helium taken into account .",
    "however , for comparison we also did a calculation with this code enforcing the molecularity and neutrality of the hydrogen - helium gas ( only h@xmath28 and he ) .",
    "this corresponds again to a situation close to the eos used in the hydrodynamic simulations , except for the inclusion of the variation of the degrees of freedom with temperature .",
    "[ fig::shockprof_cdp ] shows a 1d vertical profile of the entropy as the gas passes through the shock front right below the planet ( vertical cut through radius=5.2 au , azimuth=0.0 ) . as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , only the lower half of the circumstellar disk is simulated , therefore the co - latitute ranges in this figure from 1.562 radians to 1.57079 ( @xmath29 ) , the latter being the midplane value .",
    "the entropies shown were calculated with cea assuming only h@xmath28 and he .",
    "one can observe that the gas lost significant amount of entropy ( @xmath30/baryon ) when passing through the shock of the circumplanetary disk .",
    "the shock front itself is visible as a spike ( the zeldovich spike ) .",
    "it is obvious that in the vertical influx and at the zeldovich spike the entropy is very high ( 17 - 23 @xmath31/baryon ) as we are dealing with low - density preheated gas falling from the top of the gap .",
    "the entropy is minimal at the planet location ( around 13 @xmath1/baryon for each planet ) .",
    "this shows that also in 3d , an accretion shock is found to play a crucial role in regulating the planet s thermodynamic state . comparing the 3 - 10 @xmath4 gas giants",
    ", it can be observed that with increasing mass , the stronger is the shock , and the higher is the radiative entropy reduction .",
    "this is visible from the decreasing value of the minimum of @xmath23 at some distance behind the shock . also on the mid - plane ( right - end of the figure ) the 10 @xmath4 simulation has the lowest entropy . in the case of the 1 @xmath26 planet , where there is only a circumplanetary envelope without any shock ,",
    "the entropy almost steadily decreasing while approaching the planet .",
    "the shock @xmath32 and post - shock @xmath23 entropies ( measured in and immediately after the zeldovich spike , respectively ) for the four different eos can be found in table [ tab::entropy ] .",
    "the motivation to measure the entropy after the spike is to estimate the entropy of the gas which the planet will eventually accrete .",
    "currently we find high , `` hot - start '' like entropies in the ideal gas eos limit .",
    "the saumon - chabrier eos also give very similar entropy values ( within 0.1 @xmath1/baryon ) to the cea values , as expected .",
    "the sackur - tetrode expression gives somewhat higher ( by 0.6 - 0.7 @xmath1/baryon ) specific entropies .",
    "in contrast to this , in the zeldovich spike itself ( and in a small envelope right around the planet s position ) , the entropy values differ significantly when ionization and dissociation is included in cea relative to the neutral case , since here ionization and dissociation should happen .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also estimated with cea the mass fractions of h ( dissociation ) and h+ ( ionization ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig::ion - diss ] ) for the 10 @xmath4 planet .",
    "for all planetary masses the polar shock surface is so hot ( @xmath33 k ) , that the h@xmath34 molecules are dissociated , and in the 10 jupiter case ( @xmath35 k ) hydrogen is even ionized .",
    "the presence of h+ at the shock surface assumes a detectable h-@xmath36 emission from this extended ( in comparison to a typical planetary radius of a few jovian radii ) region .",
    "this typical accretion tracer was recently detected around the planet , lkca15b @xcite .",
    "we calculated the upper limit for h-@xmath36 flux from the shock of the 10 @xmath4 planet using eq . 21 in @xcite and found @xmath37 .",
    "for the planetary accretion , we applied the expression @xmath38 and its scaling with @xmath39 used in @xcite .",
    "the accretion rates to the planet calculated from our simulations are 9.8 , 13.89 , @xmath40 for the 3 , 5 , 10 @xmath4 planets , which indicate @xmath41 4 to 8 @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "this translates to @xmath41 4 to 7 @xmath44 for h-@xmath36 luminosity , an order of magnitude lower than what was measured in lkca15b .",
    "given that our h-@xmath36 line flux upper limit is three orders of magnitude higher than our planet emitted line flux , it is also plausible that the shock of circumplanetary disk accounts for difference found with @xcite .",
    "our results indicate , that by detecting the h-@xmath36 emission , one can not necessarily distinguish whether it tracks the accretion onto the circumplanetary disk or from the accreting planet itself .",
    "only the lower half of the disk is shown , so the mid - plane is at the top of the figures . in this case",
    ", ionization occurs at the shock front , which suggests that there is h-@xmath36 emission .",
    "dissociation only is found in the shock surfaces of 3 and 5 @xmath4 gas giants . ]    when observing a forming embedded giant planet via direct imaging , one has to be careful from where the detected luminosity originates . as we see on the temperature color map of fig .",
    "[ fig::entr ] , part of the shock front on the surface of the circumplanetary disk and protoplanet is very luminous due to shock heating .",
    "this part of the shock front extends to @xmath41100 - 250 @xmath45 in diameter for the 3 to 10 @xmath4 planet simulations .",
    "this part is optically thick in our grey approximation , so it is possible that observationally this shock front is the surface the observations detect , at least in some wavelengths , rather than the actual protoplanet below . because the luminosities of forming directly imaged planets are used to distinguish between `` hot - start '' and `` cold - start '' scenarios , and also to estimate the planetary mass , it is important to consider a possible contribution from the circumplanetary disk shock luminosity .",
    "this is in particular the case if it is not possible to distinguish observationally ( spectroscopically ) the origin of the radiation , e.g. , because hard shock radiation first gets reprocessed in the surrounding disk and re - radiated at longer wavelength .",
    "this highlights that observationally , even intrinsically cold planets could look like `` hot - start '' planets during formation if they are surrounded by luminous shocks on the circumplanetary disk surface . in conclusion ,",
    "circumplanetary disk shock surfaces play a key role not only in regulating a planet s post - formation thermodynamic state , but also for the observational appearance of protoplanets during formation .",
    "in this paper we present a study of the thermodynamics found in global three - dimensional radiative hydrodynamical simulations of embedded accreting giant planets of 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 @xmath4 .",
    "as described in detail in @xcite , the accretional gas flow from the circumstellar disk to the planet is the following",
    ". the gas acts to close the gap opened by the planet in the circumstellar disk , especially so in the high co - latitute regions .",
    "gas enters the gap region , and then falls nearly freely in a vertical influx onto the circumplanetary disk and protoplanet .",
    "because this vertical inflow is supersonic ( mach = 6.2 , 8.1 , 10.3 for the 3 , 5 , 10 @xmath4 planets , respectively ) , it shocks on the surface of the circumplanetary disk and on the polar region of the protoplanet before becoming part of the disk and eventually reaching the protoplanet . in this work we showed that the gas undergoes a significant reduction of the specific entropy ( typically more than 3 @xmath1/baryon ) while passing through the shock front that is found to be supercritical .",
    "the vertical influx has a very high entropy which after the shock in the disk mid - plane reaches a minimum value .",
    "we found that the circumplanetary disk consists of gas of significantly lower entropy than the vertical influx and the lowest entropies are found in a spherical small envelope around the planet within the inner parts of the circumplanetary disk .",
    "we conclude that shocks play a key role in regulating the post - formation entropy .    because the shock front on the circumplanetary disk is hot , optically thick ( in our grey - approximation ) , and this luminous region is extended ( 100 - 250 @xmath45 )",
    ", it can contribute strongly to the bolometric luminosity of a directly imaged planet if the gas giant is still accreting .",
    "therefore it is important to disentangle the luminosity of the shock front on the upper layer of the circumplanetary disk from the luminosity of the protoplanet itself beneath the shock surface .",
    "our radiative hydrodynamic simulations compute temperatures taking into account radiative cooling with the inclusion of dust opacities .",
    "however , the use of ideal gas eos does not take into account ionization and dissociation .",
    "this can lead to too high temperatures , and means that we can not yet exactly predict the post - formation entropies . to estimate where dissociation and ionization could occur , we used the cea code to determine potential h and h+ regions .",
    "we found that for 3 - 10 @xmath4 planets dissociation occurs in front of the polar shock surface indicating that non - ideal effect could be important .",
    "in the 10 jupiter - mass simulation the shock surface is so hot to also produced h+ , which means that there could be extended @xmath46 emission from this region , which may be detectable , as seen in lkca 15 b @xcite .",
    "shock surfaces on the surface of the circumplanetary disk and the polar region of the protoplanet could therefore also be important for the observational appearance of forming giant planets .",
