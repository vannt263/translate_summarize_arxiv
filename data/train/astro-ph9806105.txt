    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation is a direct imprint of the primordial matter , and its importance for cosmology can not be overestimated @xcite .",
    "the forthcoming map @xcite and planck @xcite satellite missions are expected to carry out high - resolution , low - noise measurements of the cmb temperature and polarization , yielding a stringent test of our theories of cosmological structure formation .",
    "one of the pronounced differences between the competing theories is a gaussian distribution of the density fluctuations in most inflationary theories versus the generically non - gaussian inhomogeneities in scenarios based on topological defects .",
    "for this reason , detection of non - gaussian features in the cmb is important for distinguishing the cosmological models .",
    "however , even if the fluctuations of the cmb were gaussian at the surface of last scattering , their later evolution would have introduced certain non - gaussian features in their distribution .",
    "one of such effects is gravitational lensing by matter present along trajectories of the primordial photons . while the effect of weak gravitational lensing on the power spectrum of the cmb fluctuations has been extensively studied ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , including its relevance to observations of large - scale structure @xcite and cosmological parameter estimation @xcite , it is only recently that attention has been drawn to the appearance of non - gaussian signal in the cmb due to weak lensing @xcite .    to identify a sky map as coming from an intrinsically non - gaussian model rather than from a lensed inflationary one , we need to distinguish the non - gaussian signature of lensing from that of other processes .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate in detail the effect of weak gravitational lensing on the distribution of the cmb fluctuations and to fully characterize the emergence of non - gaussian features . rather than restrict ourselves to a specific criterion of gaussianity at the outset",
    ", we describe the lensed sky in a general way by using the formalism of generating functionals , somewhat similar to that used in quantum field theory . a description of a random field in terms of a generating functional is equivalent to giving the full probability distribution and in principle is enough to evaluate any field statistic .    to test for the signature of lensing in practice , we chose a criterion based on cumulants of the temperature distribution @xcite .",
    "cumulants are generic additive and scale - sensitive probes of gaussianity defined through moments of the field and are easy to compute in our context",
    ". recent studies of geometrical criteria of gaussianity @xcite show that the `` generalized genus '' statistics based on minkowski functionals @xcite are sensitive to the @xmath1-point temperature distribution at points separated by the smallest map scale . a direct examination of that temperature distribution using cumulants yields a statistic essentially equivalent to or possibly more discriminative than the generalized genus .",
    "thus motivated , we apply a cumulant statistic to detect the non - gaussian effects of lensing .",
    "the distribution of the cmb after lensing depends on the initial cmb power spectrum and on the distribution and evolution of the lensing sources , all of which have to be taken from a particular cosmological model . we compute the effects of lensing in typical inflationary cdm cosmological models , using the program cmbfast @xcite to obtain the unlensed cmb power spectrum and the lens distribution .",
    "as our gaussianity test , we evaluate the dimensionless cumulant @xmath2 which of all cumulants is expected to show the largest deviation from the gaussian value @xmath3 , as well as the next largest cumulant @xmath4 . using a wide range of cosmological parameters ,",
    "we find that the maximum signal as measured by @xmath5 is generically expected to be of order @xmath6-@xmath7 at angular scales @xmath8-@xmath9 arcmin .",
    "the value of @xmath4 is smaller by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows : in the next section we present an outline and the results of our main calculation of the generating functional for the temperature distribution after lensing , in a model with gaussian initial fluctuations and gaussian distribution of lensing sources .",
    "the detailed definitions of the formalism are found in appendix [ app : weaklynong ] , while the calculation itself is deferred to appendix [ app : genfunc ] .",
    "we also comment on a generalization of our formalism to non - gaussian initial conditions and lens distributions . in section [ sec : observable ] and appendix [ app : chi ] we compute the observable effect of lensing as measured by the cumulant @xmath10 and investigate the possibility to detect this signal , which may just be at the lower limit of angular resolution and sensitivity of the forthcoming planck mission .",
    "to achieve a clear understanding of non - gaussianity due to lensing , we first wish to concentrate on the simplest case when both the initial cmb fluctuations and the lensing sources are gaussian .",
    "the effect of lensing is to make a primordial photon appear to originate from a slightly different direction of the sky .",
    "accordingly , one uses the `` lensing field '' @xmath11 to shift the original temperature field @xmath12 , so that after lensing it becomes the observed @xmath13 , @xmath14 the temperature before lensing is taken as a homogeneous gaussian random field @xmath12 with zero mean and known correlation function @xmath15 ( here @xmath16 is a point in a region of the @xmath17-dimensional euclidean space @xmath18 which represents a small flat patch of the sky .",
    "as we shall see below , all lensing effects appear on sub - degree scales , and the small - angle approximation used throughout this paper suffices for our purposes . )",
    "the `` lensing field '' @xmath11 is also assumed to be a homogeneous zero - mean gaussian random function on @xmath18 with values in the same space @xmath18 and known ( matrix - valued ) correlation function @xmath19 ( the function @xmath20 is the same as @xmath21 in the notation of ref .  @xcite . ) due to homogeneity , all our correlation functions depend only on distance , @xmath22",
    ".    we shall assume below that the angular displacement @xmath23 due to lensing is `` small '' and it makes sense to expand in @xmath23 .",
    "quantitatively , the lensing effect is small if the standard deviation of the deflection angle @xmath24 gives a scale at which the original temperature field does not change appreciably .",
    "this condition can be expressed through the real - space correlation functions of the two fields as @xmath25 as we verified numerically , this condition holds for all inflationary models .",

    "the correlation functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be computed from any given cosmological model .",
    "the cmb correlation function is conventionally expressed through the angular power spectrum @xmath31 , @xmath32 the angular displacement @xmath11 is found by integrating the transverse gradient of the gravitational potential @xmath33 from the time of last scattering to the present time .",
    "the gravitational potential is related to the fluctuation of the primordial matter density @xmath34 by a poisson equation .",
    "the explicit expressions are derived by several authors ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and we shall not need to reproduce them here . although the distribution of density fluctuations @xmath34 and hence of the gravitational potential @xmath33 may be non - gaussian due to either primordial topological defects or nonlinear evolution , the averaging over photon trajectories is expected to wash out , due to the central limit theorem , at least some of the non - gaussianity .",
    "we shall comment on more general initial conditions later , and for now we shall assume that a certain model of cosmological structure formation has been chosen and the corresponding correlation matrix @xmath35 of @xmath36 has been computed .    even if both the original field @xmath12 and the deflection @xmath23 are gaussian , the field @xmath13 after lensing has a non - gaussian distribution .",

    "( [ lnzans ] ) together with the diagrammatic method of computing the coefficients @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , ... is our main result describing the characteristic non - gaussian contributions of gravitational lensing .    from the spatial dependence of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ c4ans ] ) it is clear that the @xmath62-th order cumulant @xmath57 vanishes for certain combinations of points , for instance @xmath63 .",
    "it can be shown that similar restrictions hold for higher - order cumulants and , in particular , that the one - point cumulants @xmath64 for @xmath65 vanish , which means that the one - point temperature distribution remains gaussian .",
    "this is a manifestation of the specific signature of gravitational lensing : it only modifies the distribution of relative angular distances between the cmb photons .",
    "the condition that first - order corrections to the power spectrum due to lensing are small is , by inspection of eq .",
    "( [ c2ans ] ) , equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ cgsmall ] ) , so the expansion in @xmath20 is justified . in typical cosmological models ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath20 is never larger than @xmath6 in units of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ cgsmall ] ) .",
    "since the total power of @xmath41 in a diagram is equal to twice the number of vertices , it follows that diagrams contributing to higher - order cumulants will be suppressed by additional factors of @xmath20 , and the non - gaussian signal in higher - order cumulants rapidly becomes negligible .",
    "the most significant effects of gravitational lensing are therefore expected in the power spectrum ( i.e.  in @xmath59 ) and in the @xmath62-th order cumulant @xmath57 .",
    "( [ c2ans])([c4ans ] ) are consistent with the results of seljak @xcite and bernardeau @xcite .",
    "our approach is somewhat similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite where the non - gaussian contributions to the @xmath17- and @xmath62-point correlators of temperature were investigated by expansion in the angular displacement @xmath23 , and the results of ref.@xcite are of course reproduced by the leading - order expressions given by our eqs .",
    "( [ c2ans])([c4ans ] ) . as also noted by bernardeau @xcite , the correction to the power spectrum given by eq .",
    "( [ c2ans ] ) corresponds , in the lowest order in @xmath20 , to a more precise formula derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .    having treated the simplest case of gaussian fields , we now consider the possible generalization of our method to non - gaussian initial conditions and lensing source distributions .",
    "such a generalization can be implemented by introducing new kinds of diagrams contributing to the cumulant expansion .",
    "the non - gaussian effects may not be limited to even - numbered cumulants in that case .",
    "the generating functional of the lensed temperature can still be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ zexp2 ] ) , where one needs to put in a non - gaussian generating functional @xmath66 $ ] to represent the lensing sources as well as a non - gaussian term ( e.g.  cubic or quartic in @xmath41 ) in the exponential for each non - vanishing cumulant of the initial cmb distribution .",
    "then a reasoning similar to the one presented here and in appendix [ app : genfunc ] will again lead to a diagrammatic representation of cumulants . if the initial cmb distribution has nonzero cumulants of odd order , vertices giving odd powers of @xmath41 will also be present in the diagrams .",
    "on the other hand , non - gaussianities in the lensing sources lead to many - legged `` propagators '' ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "for a generic weakly non - gaussian distribution , one would expect the magnitude of an @xmath67-th order cumulant @xmath68 of the lensing sources to be of order @xmath69 . then , despite the infinite proliferation of vertices and propagators , the expression for any given cumulant will always be finite in all orders in @xmath20 and the leading order term will usually be given by few diagrams containing low - order vertices and propagators .",
    "although the signature of lensing becomes less clear - cut for a non - gaussian initial cmb distribution , one can still distinguish some intrinsic non - gaussian features from those due to lensing .",
    "for instance , one can show that the cumulant @xmath70 is unchanged after lensing .",
    "our formalism seems to require knowledge of the full generating functionals @xmath71 $ ] and @xmath66 $ ] for the lensing sources and original cmb distributions , but in fact leading - order results can be obtained using only the first few cumulants of those distributions , such as the three - point cumulant of the lensing sources @xmath72 which contributes to @xmath57 according to the diagram in fig .",
    "the cumulants of the lensing sources can in principle be estimated from @xmath73-body cosmological simulations or from galaxy surveys , which is an interesting direction for future work .",
    "many different statistics have been proposed and used to probe for non - gaussian features in the cmb . here",
    "we shall consider a form of the cumulants - based criterions suggested in @xcite which in a way generalizes the skewness and kurtosis @xcite and the genus statistics @xcite .",
    "our particular form of the cumulant criterion is related to the morphological descriptors of gaussianity based on minkowski functionals @xcite , which are a generalization of the topological genus .",
    "minkowski functionals have been applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to regularly pixelized maps , and it was found that all three morphological descriptors ( the area , the boundary length , and the genus of temperature excursion sets ) are effectively determined by the three - point distribution of temperature at nearest neighbor pixels in the map .",
    "one might as well inspect this three - point distribution directly and investigate whether it is gaussian ; such analysis would be in principle equivalent to inspection of the minkowski functional curves calculated from the same map . a standard method of checking that a distribution is gaussian is by computing its cumulants @xcite .",
    "thus we arrive to a criterion of gaussianity of a cmb map which consists of examination of various cumulants of the three - point distribution of temperature at neighbor pixels .",
    "note that the evaluation of a given cumulant requires to compute certain moments of temperature at neighbor pixel points , and since there is a fixed number of neighbors for each pixel , the total number of necessary operations is linear in the number of pixels in the map .    for the purposes of this paper , however , we shall limit ourselves to considering the two - point cumulants of the distribution of temperature , computed for pairs of points separated by a fixed angular distance @xmath74 .",
    "the cumulants of a two - variable distribution are labeled by two indices and may be defined by    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the generating function for the joint distribution . to be definite ,",
    "we denote the two field values by @xmath77 and @xmath78 , although we imply in our expressions below that averaging is performed over all pairs of points separated by @xmath74 .",
    "the formulae for the practical evaluation of cumulants from a given map follow from eq .",
