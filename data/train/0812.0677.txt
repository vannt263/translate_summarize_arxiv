    "most theories of interest contain fermion fields which lead to some or all integration variables being anticommuting grassmann ` numbers ' . in the standard approach these integrations",
    " possibly after introducing additional bose fields  are gaussian and are performed exactly .",
    "the result is an effective action of the bosonic fields alone which become coupled non - locally .",
    "the known monte carlo techniques to practically simulate such systems are mostly based on molecular dynamics and the hybrid monte carlo idea ( hmc ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these methods have been improved and optimized rather successfully over the years by a very large effort of many members of the lattice community . on",
    "the other hand practitioners know that once fermions are decoupled then hmc for locally coupled bose fields is not a very efficient algorithm compared to alternatives like over - relaxation which are then available , not to mention the ( unfortunately few ) cases where cluster methods can be applied .",
    "this implies a large penalty for fermions even in cases where their effects are only small . at small fermion masses",
    "the fermionic forces in hmc tend to grow and the step size of the molecular dynamics trajectories has to be taken small enough . with this quasi - continuous evolution one then has to be cautious about possible long autocorrelations .",
    "after all , to the best of the author s knowledge , the ergodicity of hmc has not been formally proven .",
    "maybe for the aforementioned reasons among others some part of the community has remained motivated to look for radically different approaches .",
    "a rather natural idea is to look for a representation of fermions as some sort of ` sum over configurations ' more similar to the bosons .",
    "one of the pioneering papers developing such ideas is @xcite .",
    "there as in numerous succeeding attempts one starts from an operator formulation of fermions and inserts intermediate states in the occupation number basis between factors of the transfer matrix . in this way",
    "occupied sites map out an ensemble of ` world - lines ' or a gas of loops of fermions on the lattice .",
    "often the amplitudes that arise oscillate in sign with the danger of leading to an unmanageable signal to noise ratio , the infamous fermionic sign problem .",
    "the inclusion of gauge fields in this approach poses additional problems .",
    "a somewhat different approach was successful for  but also restricted to  qcd at infinite gauge coupling , @xmath2 , @xcite . in the euclidean path integral with staggered fermions but no gauge plaquette term the group valued gauge fields can be integrated out first .",
    "the resulting model of locally paired even grassmann elements has contributions that can be viewed as a statistical system of explicitly color - neutral mesons ( dimers ) and baryon loops .",
    "both these systems and the world - line gas  la @xcite are difficult to simulate efficiently by local methods due to constraints which conflict with local deformations of the configurations . in some cases",
    "efficient nonlocal updates could be devised @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a ` more euclidean ' version of the idea was proposed in @xcite .",
    "these authors started from the determinant of the integrated - out staggered fermions and tried to stochastically generate its expansion into cycles .",
    "however the restriction to local updates and the sign problem , even for @xmath0 in this case , have limited the use of the method .    in @xcite ( see also @xcite )",
    "a loop or world - line representation was proposed for the partition function of standard two - dimensional euclidean wilson fermions in an external scalar field .",
    "they were mapped on a certain 8-vertex model .",
    "based on it the gross - neveu model was simulated with local updates in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the same representation was re - derived directly from the grassmann integral for charge self - conjugate ( majorana ) wilson fermions .",
    "the mapping between wilson fermions and a loop - gas could in addition be made precise also for a finite torus with ( anti)periodic boundary conditions . a cluster algorithm for the loop - gas",
    "was developed in @xcite which produces almost uncorrelated loop configurations at low cost . in the sequel willi rath and the author have tried to compute correlations based on these configurations @xcite .",
    "the only solution we have found so - far proceeds via the numerical generation of the scalar @xmath3-field that usually factorizes the gross - neveu interaction .",
    "then the close to singular dirac operator in this random scalar field has to be inverted and the cpu time ends up being spent in a very similar fashion as in hmc .    in this paper , as an alternative approach , we adopt the ` worm ' algorithm of prokofev and svistunov ( ps ) @xcite to lattice fermions of the wilson type . to this end",
    "we build on the study of the ps algorithm for the ising model carried out as a preparation in @xcite .",
    "while there the ( untruncated ) strong coupling expansion is sampled , the fermion loop - gas corresponds to the quite similar hopping expansion .",
    "we here extend the loop - gas formulation of fermions on a torus in two ways .",
    "we generalize @xcite to including two spinor field insertions at arbitrary lattice sites .",
    "it turns out that the ps algorithm is ideally suited to keep track of the non - local amplitudes involved due to fermi statistics .",
    "the second non - trivial extension takes this construction to majorana fermions in three euclidean dimensions .",
    "while we understand why the fermionic sign problem mentioned before is absent in two dimensions if the system size is large in correlation lengths , the full problem has to be confronted in three dimensions .",
    "we indeed find for free fermions that are implemented numerically in this study , that the ps algorithm for @xmath0 is similarly efficient as in the ising model .",
    "while clearly correct in principle also in @xmath1 it fails numerically with the present technique when the continuum limit is approached .",
    "we nonetheless find the three dimensional loop representation theoretically quite interesting .",
    "we think that the free majorana fermion in @xmath1 is an excellent study ground for more clever techniques , for instance cluster improved observables , to still overcome the sign problem , perhaps along the lines of @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section we set up our notation for the lattice fermions discussed followed by section 3 introducing dimers that label all possible hopping graphs needed for the ps simulation .",

    "the boundary conditions are coded into a vector @xmath8 with components 0,1 by the condition @xmath9 and similarly for @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a unit vector in the positive  @xmath12 direction .",
    "unless stated otherwise , the mass @xmath13 is assumed to be a real @xmath14-dependent periodic external field @xmath15 here .",

    "we consider only one such component in the following @xmath27 note that the matrix in this quadratic form is antisymmetric . by collecting diagonal and neighbor terms",

    "for constant @xmath13 such an evaluation can proceed by fourier expansion and will serve us as a check below .",
    "otherwise the pfaffian is a problem similar to the fermion determinant and methods like hmc are suitable at least for an even number of flavors @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our objective here is however to develop a simulation method alternative to this approach .",
    "we end this section with the remark that , in contrast to the ising model , @xmath42 is not equal to the ordinary partition function . instead",
    "one may show that for any @xmath13 @xmath43 holds . to derive this relation we use that the space of antisymmetric @xmath19 matrices is only one - dimensional , given by multiples of  the second pauli matrix .",

    "the analogous expansion requires 0 or 2 dimers around all sites .",
