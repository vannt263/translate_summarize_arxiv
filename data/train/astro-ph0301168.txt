    "we reported at the august 2001 gttingen meeting on cvs that vw hyi in outburst has dwarf nova oscillations ( dnos ) and quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) that keep an approximately constant period ratio of @xmath0 16 as they vary in period by a factor of two during the late stages of outburst ( warner & woudt 2002a ; see also woudt & warner 2002 )",
    ". interpreting the dnos and qpos in vw hyi as analogues of the high and low frequency qpos observed in x - ray binaries , we showed that vw hyi lies on an extension to low frequencies of the two - qpo correlation in x - ray binaries found by psaltis , belloni & van der klis ( 1999 ) .",
    "an important addition to this correlation was made by mauche ( 2002 ) , who found that the x - ray dnos and qpos in ss cyg also fall on this relationship , which helps to close the gap between the cvs and the x - ray binaries .",
    "one aspect of qpos in cvs is that double dnos are sometimes observed , and their frequency difference is equal to the qpo frequency ( woudt & warner 2002 ) - which we interpret as the dno rotating beam reprocessed off a progradely travelling wave in the inner disc ( warner & woudt 2002b ) .",
    "therefore , even if a qpo is not directly observed in a light curve , a proxy for it can be found when double dnos are observed .",
    "armed with this knowledge we have searched the literature for examples of the simultaneous appearance of dnos and qpos , or their proxies .",
    "table 1 lists the results of the search .    .dnos and qpos in cvs ( periods in seconds ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , < \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    the addition of these data , obtained from observing the literature and observing the sky , to the two - qpo diagram produces the correlation shown in figure 1 .",
    "it can be seen that the cv dno and qpo observations lie on an extension of the x - ray binary relationship to frequencies nearly three orders of magnitude lower .",
    "the essence of both the cv and the x - ray correlations is that p@xmath1 @xmath0 15 p@xmath2 .    adopting a magnetically controlled accretion model for dnos ( paczynski 1978 ;",
    "warner 1995 ; warner & woudt 2002b ) , the dno period is clearly related to the keplerian period at the magnetically truncated inner edge of the disc .",
    "a number of recent papers modelling accretion into magnetospheres find quasi - periodic accretion or oscillations ( e.g. uzdensky 2002 ; titarchuk & wood 2002 ) ; a quantitative model by goodson , bohm & winglee ( 1999 ) deduces p@xmath1/p@xmath2 @xmath0 @xmath3 .",
    "during the literature search for dnos and qpos we noticed that there are occasionally additional dnos listed that do not fall into the above category - indeed , several cvs show two sets of dnos simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , the second kind of dnos behave very differently from the ` classical ' dnos , in that their periods are relatively independent of outburst state , and they can appear during quiescence of dwarf novae ( which , apart from the apparently more strongly magnetic systems wz sge and gk per , normal dnos do not ) .",
    "the new type of dnos , which we will refer temporarily as ` longer period dnos ' - lpdnos , are demonstrated in the following stars : + * vw hyi : * in a superoutburst of vw hyi observed in 1975 haefner , schoembs & vogt ( 1977 , 1979 , see also schoembs 1977 ) found an @xmath0 80 s dno which persisted for nine nights and changed only slightly and erratically in period although the star decreased in brightness from mag 10.6 to 13.7 .",
    "we have also seen occasional dnos near 88 s in vw hyi",
    ". the normal dno periods in vw hyi range from 14 s at maximum of outburst to 40 s near return to quiescence ( woudt & warner 2002 ) .    * ec 2117 - 54 : * this newly discovered nova - like cv , from the edinburgh - cape survey , possesses normal ( including double ) dnos near 23 s and qpos near 450 s , but in addition frequently shows lpdnos near 94 s ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "thus ec 2117 - 54 has a suite of oscillations that closely resembles that of vw hyi in outburst .",
    "* ss cyg : * robinson & nather ( 1979 ) and patterson ( 1981 ) observed what they described as qpos in the range 32  36 s in two different outbursts of ss cyg , at the same time @xmath0 10 s normal dnos were present .    * ht cas and ah her : * patterson ( 1981 ) observed @xmath0 100 s qpos in ht cas and ah her in outburst , where the normal dnos are @xmath0 20 s and @xmath0 25 s respectively .",
    "the ht cas oscillations were also often seen during quiescence .      for a possible interpretation of the lpdnos we turn to measurements of @xmath4 of the white dwarf primaries . in vw hyi sion et al .",
    "( 1996 , 2001 ) have found projected rotational velocities in the range 300  500 km s@xmath5 . for @xmath6 = 65@xmath7 and a primary mass of 0.6 m@xmath8 this gives a rotation period of 120  165 s. the observed lpdno may therefore be associated with the bulk rotation of the primary ( as opposed to the rotation of the equatorial belt in the case of the normal dnos - warner & woudt 2002a , b ) , with two - pole magnetic accretion . a similar result is obtained for ss cyg , with @xmath4 = 300 km s@xmath5 ( sion 1999 ) , @xmath6 = 50@xmath7 and m = 1.2 m@xmath8 , which give a primary rotation period @xmath0 63 s.    we suggest , therefore , that the lpdnos result from accretion controlled by the magnetic field of the primary itself , whereas the normal dnos come from accretion onto the equatorial belt where a stronger field is generated by differential rotation .",
