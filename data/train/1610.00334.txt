    "galactic evolution is driven at the end - points of stellar evolution , where copious mass loss returns chemically - enriched and sometimes dusty matter back to the interstellar medium ( ism ) ; the stellar winds of evolved stars and the violent deaths of the most massive stars also inject energy and momentum into the ism , generating turbulence and galactic fountains when superbubbles pop as they reach the `` surface '' of the galactic disc .",
    "evolved stars are also excellent tracers , not just of the feedback processes , but also of the underlying populations , that were formed from millions to billions of years prior to their appearance .",
    "the evolved phases of evolution generally represent the most luminous , and often the coolest , making evolved stars brilliant beacons at ir wavelengths , where it is also easier to see them deep inside galaxies as dust is more transparent at those longer wavelengths than in the optical and ultraviolet where their progenitors shine .",
    "the final stages of evolution of stars with birth masses up to @xmath18 m@xmath4  asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and red supergiants ( rsgs )  are characterised by strong radial pulsations of the cool atmospheric layers , rendering them identifiable as long - period variables ( lpvs ) in photometric monitoring campaigns spanning months to years ( e.g. , whitelock , feast & catchpole 1991 ; wood et al .  1992 ; wood 2000 ; ita et al .  2004a , b ) .",
    "the prevalent theory of disc galaxy formation hinges on the formation of isolated discs through the dissipational collapse of a gaseous proto - galaxy embedded in cold dark matter halos ( white & rees 1978 ; fall & efstathiou 1980 ; peebles 1984 ) .",
    "thin discs are built through gas accretion , while spheroids and thick discs are built via mergers ( steinmetz & navarro 2002 ; brook et al .",
    "2004 ; brooks et al .  2009 ) .",
    "an alternative scenario for disc formation is based on gas - rich major mergers ( robertson et al .",
    "2006 ; stewart et al .",
    "in fact , each of these scenarios may operate depending on galaxy environments ( blanton et al .",
    "spatially - resolved observational estimates of the star formation histories ( sfhs )  and stellar chemical abundances  in spiral galaxies are a robust way to constrain models for their formation and evolution ( eggen et al .  1962 ; freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) .",
    "this has become possible within galaxies of the local group ( e.g. , sarajedini et al .",

    "m33 is a low luminosity , late type disc spiral galaxy in the local group of galaxies . with a stellar mass of @xmath19@xmath20 m@xmath4 and neutral gas mass of @xmath21 m@xmath4 ( corbelli 2003 ) , m33 is less massive but more gas - rich than the milky way disc , which has @xmath22 m@xmath4 ( licquia & newman ; cf .",

    "2006 ; u et al .",
    "2009 ) , its large  but not too large  angular size ( @xmath25 ) and low inclination ( @xmath26 ) offer us a unique opportunity to study its stellar populations , their history and their feedback across an entire spiral galaxy . using colour  magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of resolved stars in m33 , barker et al .",

    "more recently , williams et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found a negative age gradient within the break radius in the radial mass profile , @xmath27 kpc , in four fields on m33 s southern major axis .",
    "this hints at multiple mechanisms at play , that shaped the m33 disc as we see it today , and calls for independent , homogeneous analyses across the entire span of the m33 galaxy . here",
    "we provide such study .",
    "the main objectives of our project are described in javadi , van loon & mirtorabi ( 2011c ) : to construct the mass function of lpvs and derive from this the sfh in m33 ; to correlate spatial distributions of the lpvs of different mass with galactic structures ( spheroid , disc and spiral arm components ) ; to measure the rate at which dust is produced and fed into the ism ; to establish correlations between the dust production rate , luminosity , and amplitude of an lpv ; and to compare the _ in situ _ dust replenishment with the amount of pre - existing dust .",
    "paper i in the series presented the photometric catalogue of stars in the inner square kpc ( javadi et al .",
    "2011a ) , with paper ii presenting the galactic structure and sfh ( javadi , van loon and mirtorabi 2011b ) , and paper iii presenting the mass - loss mechanism and dust production rate ( javadi et al .",
    "paper iv presented the photometric catalogue of stars in a nearly square degree area covering much of the m33 optical disc .",
    "this fifth paper in the series covers the sfh across the enlarged area ; the next paper will present an analysis of the mass return to the m33 disc .",
    "in paper iv we described the method employed to identify large - amplitude lpvs across the galactic disc of m33 with the wfcam imager on the united kingdom ir telescope ( ukirt ) on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the area that was monitored covers almost a square degree ( @xmath28 ) ; given the inclination and distance of m33 , we thus probe all of its disc out to a galactocentric radius of 7.5 kpc , i.e.  0.88 @xmath29 ( optical radius ) , and out to 15 kpc ( 1.76 @xmath29 ) in certain directions .",
    "the observations were done between 20052007 in the k@xmath30-band ( @xmath31 @xmath32 m ) with occasionally observations in j- and h - bands ( @xmath33 and 1.68 @xmath32 m , respectively ) for the purpose of obtaining colour information .",
    "the photometric catalogue comprises 403734 stars , among which 4643 stars were identified as lpvs  agb stars , super - agb stars and rsgs . their distribution over magnitude and colour",
    "is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "some brighter variable rsgs are found ( around @xmath34 mag ) , but the clump of variable stars with @xmath35 mag are foreground stars and all are saturated .",
    "these stars are removed from further analysis .",
    "the amplitude is generally a@xmath36 mag , but a small fraction of variable stars ( 8% ) reach a@xmath37 mag . among these extreme variables ,",
    "311 have six or fewer measurements and their amplitudes are therefore unreliable . disregarding those , only 20 stars remain with a@xmath38 mag .",
    "we separate the stars in our catalogue into three categories : massive stars , agb stars and rgb stars , on the basis of k@xmath30-band magnitude and @xmath39 colour criteria ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we define a demarcation line between hot massive stars and cooler , less - massive giant stars to run from @xmath40 to @xmath41 mag , with massive stars those that have @xmath42 colours bluer than this ( down to @xmath43 mag ) or that have @xmath44 mag , and agb stars and rgb stars those that have @xmath39 colours redder than this and that have @xmath45 mag ( agb ) or @xmath46 mag ( rgb , which does extend to much fainter magnitudes than our survey completeness ) .",
    "we left small gaps to avoid contamination .",
    "the distributions of different types of near - ir populations across the galactic disc of m33 is shown in fig .  2 , deprojected onto the m33 galactic plane , with dashed lines showing the distributions for the variables that were identified in our near - ir monitoring programme .",
    "there is a clear difference between the stellar populations within the inner @xmath47 kpc , with rgb stars showing a core but massive stars  in particular those identified by their variability  showing a cusp .",
    "further out , all populations show a distribution consistent with an exponential disc .",
    "an exponential profile fit of the form @xmath48 yields @xmath49 for the agb stars ( @xmath50 kpc for the variables ) and @xmath50 kpc for the massive stars ( @xmath51 kpc for the variables , with a sersi core ) .",
    "the rgb population , dominated by old stars , is fit with a sersi profile , with @xmath52 kpc .",
    "this inflated distribution could be a sign of dynamical relaxation .",
    "the relatively large scalelength of the massive stars , which still reflect their birth sites , compared to the agb stars may be an indication of the inside  out formation of the disc of m33 , whilst the central hike in density of the massive stars may indicate accretion - induced star formation ( see paper ii ) .",
    "the method used here to derive the sfh strongly depends on the agb phase of stellar evolution . to date , the padova models ( marigo et al .  2008 ) are the most realistic . the full agb evolution is calculated  except for the super - agb phase of stellar evolution ( @xmath539 m@xmath4 : siess 2007 ; doherty et al .",
    "2015 ) , which is too fast to be calculated without a separate treatment .",
    "it accurately accounts for the third dredge - up , and hot bottom burning ( hbb ; iben & renzini 1983 ) in the most massive agb stars ( @xmath546 m@xmath4 ) .",
    "they also include the effects of molecular opacities in the cool stellar mantles and atmospheres , which becomes especially apparent in the transformation from oxygen - dominated ( m - type ) agb stars to carbon stars in the birth mass range @xmath554 m@xmath4 ( girardi & marigo 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , and crucial for our method , the padova models predict the pulsation properties and the effects of circumstellar dust production on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the star plus its dust envelope .",
    "separate models cover the massive stars , of which the lower mass range ( @xmath5630 m@xmath4 become rsgs .",
    "the full suite of models thus enables us to evaluate the sfh from as long ago as 10 gyr , to as recent as @xmath57 myr ago .",
    "that said , those models do not consider the effects of magnetic fields or rotation on the mixing process inside the stars . including more efficient mixing would make stars live longer and massive stars evolve to cooler rsgs ( meynet & maeder 2000 ; heger , woosley & spruit 2005 )",
    "likewise , the life times of intermediate - mass stars are prolonged in the presence of convective overshoot ( marigo & giardi 2007 ) .",
    "also , the thermal pulsing agb is computed by adopting parameterisations for the efficiency of third dredge - up , and the threshold temperature at which it sets in , not by solving the equations governing the stellar internal structure .",
    "in paper ii , we presented a novel way to derive the sfh by using cool , large - amplitude lpvs which are identified in ir monitoring programmes .",
    "we use the fact that these variables have reached the very final stages of their evolution , and their brightness can thus be transformed into their mass at birth by employing theoretical evolutionary tracks , or by isochrones .",
    "the lpvs are located at the cool end of each of the isochrones . hence , we convert the observed k - band magnitude ( which is close to the peak in the sed , thus minimising uncertainties in the bolometric corrections ) into the birth mass .",
    "this was done in paper ii for four different metallicities , from super - solar ",
    "suitable for massive elliptical galaxies and stellar populations in the bulges of massive spiral galaxies such as the milky way  to sub - solar values appropriate for galaxies such as the magellanic clouds ( rezaeikh et al .",
    "as discussed in paper ii , the central region of m33 has an approximately solar metallicity ( rosolowsky & simon 2008 ; magrini et al.2009 ) , for which we adopt @xmath58 .",
    "the disc of m33 outside that central region is characterised by sub - solar metallicity ; in paper iv we showed that @xmath59 agrees well with our cmds as well as the literature .",
    "magrini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) derived an oxygen abundance gradient based on hii regions of @xmath60 dex kpc@xmath5 for @xmath61 kpc and @xmath62 dex kpc@xmath5 for @xmath63 kpc , suggesting a possibly slightly larger range of metallicities .",
    "however , in paper ii we showed that the sfhs derived using @xmath64 and @xmath58 are very similar and hence we are not worried about small deviations from these typical values .",
    "since the method was described in detail in paper ii , here we only provide a brief summary .",
    "the total mass of the stars created between times @xmath65 and @xmath66 is defined as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the star formation rate ( sfr ) , in m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "the mass @xmath69 corresponds to the number of stars formed , @xmath70 , as : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the imf , which is described by : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the normalisation factor and @xmath75 is defined for different ranges in stellar mass , @xmath76 , by kroupa ( 2001 ) : @xmath77 for the minimum and maximum of the stellar mass ranges we adopt @xmath78 m@xmath4 and @xmath79 m@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the question now is how many of these stars , @xmath80 , are lpvs around time @xmath65 , which is when we observe them .",
    "the number of stars with mass between @xmath81 and @xmath82 that were created between times @xmath65 and @xmath66 is : @xmath83 combining the above equations we have : @xmath84 when we determine @xmath68 over an age bin @xmath85 , the number of lpvs observed in that age bin , @xmath86 , depends on the duration of the evolutionary phase of large - amplitude , long - period variability , the `` pulsation duration '' @xmath87 : @xmath88 inverting the above equations , we obtain a relation between the observed number of lpvs in a certain age bin , and the sfr that long ago : @xmath89 note that the value of the normalisation constant @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) does not matter .",
    "the relation between k - band magnitude and mass was constructed in paper ii from the points on each of the padova isochrones when stars reach their peak brightness in the k - band .",
    "the relation was monotonic for agb stars and rsgs ; in the mass regime @xmath901.3 the padova isochrones suggest an excursion towards fainter k - band magnitudes .",
    "the stellar evolution models for these super - agb stars are truncated .",
    "we compared two different approaches to deal with this : [ 1 ] interpolation of the @xmath91@xmath92 relation through the mass range of super - agb stars , or [ 2 ] accepting the jump to fainter magnitudes from agb to super - agb stars .",
    "the second approach yielded unrealistic results for the sfh while the first approach was credible , so we adopt the interpolation approach here also .",
    "dusty lpvs suffer from attenuation . while the isochrones of marigo et al.(2008 ) include an estimate of the photometric effects of circumstellar dust their values are very uncertain .",
    "instead , we correct for the effects of reddening by tracing the reddened stars , along the reddening vector , back to the point on the isochrone where they would lie in the absence of reddening . as fig",
    ".  1 illustrates , there exist two types of reddening ; carbon stars ( e.g. , at @xmath93 gyr , @xmath94 ) redden very rapidly , resulting in a relatively shallow trajectory in the cmd , whereas oxygen - rich stars ( such as low - mass stars at @xmath95 gyr , @xmath96 ) experience a `` greyer '' type of reddening due to the greater transparency of silicates .",
    "we thus obtain reddening - free k - band magnitudes , @xmath97 , from the relation : @xmath98 with @xmath99 mag mag@xmath5 for carbon stars and @xmath100 mag mag@xmath5 for oxygen - rich stars at @xmath58 , and @xmath101 mag mag@xmath5 for carbon stars and @xmath102 mag mag@xmath5 for oxygen - rich stars at @xmath59 .",
    "the reddening correction will be applied to stars with @xmath103 mag . in the case where no j - band data are available we use a similar reddening correction prescribed as a function of @xmath104 colour . in the case",
    "neither j- nor h - band data are available we assume a detection limit of @xmath105 mag .",
    "it is therefore important to distinguish between carbon stars and oxygen - rich stars .",
    "unfortunately , such information is not available for the majority of our lpvs in m33 .",
    "instead , we fix the mass range for carbon stars ; based on theory and observation in the lmc ( groenewegen & de jong 1993 ; van loon , marshall & zijlstra 2005 ; girardi & marigo 2007 ) we expect at solar and slightly sub - solar metallicity carbon stars to descend from stars in the range @xmath554 m@xmath4  at low mass the third dredge - up is not strong enough to change the composition of the surface to carbon dominated , while hbb prevents carbon to enrich the surface in higher mass stars . in practice , we first apply the carbon dust correction to all reddened stars ; if the derived mass is in the 1.54 m@xmath4 range then we accept that star as a carbon star , otherwise we re - apply an oxygenous dust correction .",
    "we refer to paper ii for the relations converting the de - reddened k - band magnitude into birth mass , and the birth mass into lpv age , and for the parameterisation of the pulsation duration . to have a meaningful errorbar on the sfr in each age bin , instead of using equal age bins we adjust the sizes of the age bins such that each contain the same number of stars . despite the rarity of massive lpvs born relatively recently , we are still more able to detect hikes in the star formation rate within the past gyr than 10 gyr ago .",
    "so a recent `` bursty '' sfh does not preclude this from having been a feature throughout the assembly of the galaxy .",
    "finally , in paper iii we realised that the duration of the lpv phase that we detect in our survey is overestimated in the padova models , resulting in too low values for the sfr .",
    "we thus applied a correction to the pulsation duration , and hence to the sfrs that had been derived in paper ii .",
    "we will revisit this important issue in detail for the disc and central region in the discussion section .",
    "furthermore , we stress that , while our method is model dependent , the padova models are the only models that predict the pulsation behaviour , which is essential information for our method to work .",
    "we would like to encourage other groups to also predict the pulsation behaviour , to offer another avenue to empirically explore the differences between models .",
    "other models that computate the thermal - pulsing agb evolution ( but , like the padova models , not for super - agb stars ) include basti ( pietrinferni et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) . in the appendix",
    "we compare the mass  luminosity and mass  age relations between the basti and padova models .",
    "the main difference is that the faintest stars , around @xmath106 mag ) are less massive and older when using the basti models ( @xmath107 gyr compared to 10 gyr when using the padova models ) , but the difference is negligible for intermediate - age stars ( few gyr old ) .",
    "since we already derived the sfh for the central region of m33 using uist data in paper ii , we first show how this compares to the sfh derived from the wfcam data .",
    "the distribution over brightness and the present day ( birth ) mass function of lpvs are shown in fig .",
    "two peaks can be seen , one at @xmath108 and another at @xmath109 .",
    "as described in paper iv , the branch of stars brighter than @xmath110 mag was removed from further analysis because these stars are affected by saturation .",
    "however , rsgs in m33 are fainter than this , so the derived mass function is not affected .",
    "the sfh of the central square kpc of m33 is shown in fig .  4 , separately as derived from the wfcam data and from the uist data .",
    "the oldest bin is only shown in part as it extends to ( unrealistically ) large ages .",
    "the only reason it is plotted is to show that , as expected , the star formation rate we estimate for ages exceeding the hubble time is negligible .",
    "two main epochs of star formation are obvious ; a major epoch of formation @xmath1115 gyr ago ( @xmath1129.7 ) peaking around 4 gyr ago at a level @xmath113 times as high as during the subsequent couple of gyr .",
    "this is slightly shifted to more recent times compared with the uist result for which this epoch is @xmath1118 gyr ago ( @xmath1129.9 ) with a peak around 6 gyr ago ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "this could arise from the inferior angular resolution of wfcam , resulting in incompleteness and blends rendering stars brighter ( hence appearing younger ) than they really are .",
    "the uist data may be affected too , if less so ( the ancient sfr is higher than in the wfcam data ) , and hence the peak at 46 gyr may not be real and star formation could well have started  and peaked  earlier .",
    "however , this does not change our final conclusion that the sfr in the central regions of m33 has dropped considerably some 4 gyr ago .    a second epoch of star formation",
    "is seen to occur from 300 myr20 myr ago ( @xmath1157.2 ) , in both data sets , with a rate @xmath116 times higher than the aforementioned peak .",
    "there is a hint for the sfr to have been decreasing slightly over the course of this more recent epoch , suggesting that something may have happened @xmath117 myr ago which triggered an enhanced sfr .",
    "the wfcam images reach out to a galactocentric radius of nearly 15 kpc , which includes the pseudo - bulge and most of the disc and spiral arms of m33 . the distribution over brightness and the present day ( birth ) mass function of lpvs in this larger area are shown in fig .  5",
    "again , the mass distribution is dominated by two populations of lpvs ; one around @xmath118 and another around @xmath119 .",
    "there are relatively many intermediate - age agb stars in the disc compared with the central region , and this suggests that the average age of stars in the disc is lower than in the central region .",
    "the sfh across the disc of m33 is shown in fig .",
    "the double - peaked mass function is again translated into two epochs of enhanced star formation .",
    "the old epoch took place @xmath1206 gyr ago ( @xmath1219.8 ) , peaking @xmath122 gyr ago ( @xmath123 ) at a level almost twice that in the subsequent few gyr .",
    "barker et al .",
    "( 2011 ) showed that the outer disc of m33 had a major epoch of star formation @xmath1244 gyr ago ( @xmath1250.4 for a standard wmap @xmath126cdm cosmology ; dunkley et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the offset by one gyr compared to the timing of this epoch of star formation in the central region ( derived from the superior uist data ) , suggests that the outer regions of m33 are younger than the central region .",
    "this would confirm the results by li et al .",
    "this conclusion is , however , controversial since cioni et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggested the opposite .",
    "because their results were based on photometry with wfcam , they may have been affected by the crowding in the central regions .    the second",
    ", recent epoch of enhanced star formation occurred @xmath127300 myr ago ( @xmath1288.5 ) , reaching a level of almost 4 times that during the earlier epoch of star formation .",
    "we caution , though , that this is almost certainly due to the difference in time resolution : the peak of the earlier epoch is an average over @xmath129 gyr and peaks lasting only @xmath17 myr may have been much more intense than that .",
    "what is beyond doubt , however , is that the more recent peak in sfr is relatively strong compared to the same epoch in the central region of m33 .",
    "while our approach may favour the assignment of the status of carbon star over oxygen - rich star , the sfh results do not change substantially when assuming that all stars are oxygen - rich ( see appendix ) .",
    "the variation of sfh as a function of radial distance from the centre of m33 ( @xmath130 ) is shown in fig .",
    "each radius bin contains the same number of variable stars ; as a result , the bins grow in size with increasing distance .",
    "two important results become clear immediately ; firstly , the old epoch of star formation weakens and then practically disappears as one moves outward through the disc . in the outermost parts of the disc , the star formation rate gradually increases until @xmath131 myr ( @xmath128 ) ago , and then decreases again in more recent times .",
    "secondly , the very recent epoch of star formation is seen across the entire disc at a similar rate , but lower in the very central region .",
    "more subtly , star formation at intermediate ages , @xmath132 gyr ( @xmath94 ) is most pronounced in the most prominent part of the disc , @xmath133 kpc , but weaker both in the central and the outermost regions .",
    "gratier et al .  (",
    "2010 ) showed that the radial profile of total baryonic mass in m33 displays a double exponential component , with a break around @xmath134 kpc . within that radius , while the star formation efficiency is relatively constant the sfh shifts to more recent times as one moves outward ; this is referred to as the `` inside  out '' formation scenario . our analysis ( fig .",
    "7 ) clearly confirms this scenario for the disc of m33 .",
    "fig .  7 also suggests a change in sfh around @xmath134 kpc ; beyond that radius , the star formation efficiency decreases ( see also robles - valdez et al .",
    "2013 ) .    to examine the difference between the disc within @xmath135 kpc and the outer regions at @xmath136 kpc ,",
    "the mass functions for these two areas are shown separately in fig .",
    "apart from an overall drop in stellar content , the outer regions display a conspicuous dearth of intermediate - mass stars ( between @xmath1370.4 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the outer regions contain more  even in an absolute sense  low - mass , presumably old lpvs ( @xmath138 ) . in these sparsely populated regions , stars at @xmath139",
    "could be foreground stars ; we provide an estimate of this in section 4.4 .",
    "the corresponding sfhs are shown in fig .",
    "both at @xmath135 kpc and at @xmath136 kpc there is strong evidence for recent star formation .",
    "the old epoch of star formation is present in both areas as well .",
    "it is possible that the old stars in the outermost regions were formed further in , but migrated outwards through dynamical relaxation or interaction with spiral arms ( grand , kawata & cropper 2012 ) .",
    "we have divided the stellar populations into four different age bins , and plot their spatial distributions in fig .",
    "all populations are centrally concentrated , but this is especially true for the youngest and  to a lesser extent  the oldest .",
    "the intermediate - age populations are distributed more uniformly across the disc .",
    "it is interesting to note also the asymmetry in the distributions , with a higher density towards the south .",
    "the youngest population exhibits a local overdensity in the north as well , around @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) in right ascension and @xmath142 in declination .",
    "the spiral structure is not obvious in these graphs .    to assess the level of contamination by foreground stars we used the trilegal simulation tool ( girardi et al .",
    "we used the default parameters for the structure of the galaxy , simulating a 0.68 square degree field in the direction of m33 ( @xmath143 , @xmath144 ) .",
    "the region with which we compare this simulation is the area in the galaxy plane that avoided the central @xmath27 kpc .",
    "the result of this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "the variable stars with @xmath145 mag experience only a modest level of contamination ( @xmath146% ) ; those with @xmath147 mag and @xmath148 mag are not affected at all .",
    "the level of contamination for all sources with @xmath149 mag and those with @xmath150 mag and @xmath151 mag is @xmath152% .",
    "these are all upper limits , as most foreground stars would not appear as lpvs .",
    "m33 has two main , inner spiral arms  in ( the northern branch ) and is ( the southern branch ) , indicated by the spiral curves in fig .",
    "these logarithmic arms have a pitch angle of @xmath153 and can be traced out to @xmath154 kpc ; they include some of the most prominent hii regions in m33 : ngc604 ( @xmath155 , @xmath156 ) , ic143 ( @xmath157 , @xmath158 ) , ic142 ( @xmath159 , @xmath160 ) , ngc 595 ( @xmath161 , @xmath162 ) in in and ic137 ( @xmath163 , @xmath164 ) in is . however , the spiral arm pattern of m33 is much more complex , with at least four additional sets of arms that can be traced out to radii of @xmath165 , i.e.  @xmath166 kpc ( e.g. , newton 1980 ; hagen et al .",

    "this already suggests that the uist survey is no more complete than @xmath220% , and likewise the wfcam survey is no more complete than 52% .",
    "this is most likely due to the limited sampling of the lightcurves , as most of the variable stars that are sought have amplitudes that exceed the photometric uncertainties ; blending is unlikely to be a major factor as wfcam recovers 95% of the stars ( variable and not variable ) detected with the sharper uist camera .",
    "thus , the survey incompleteness of the uist and wfcam for the large - amplitude lpvs is likely to be close to 60% and 50% , respectively , leaving another factor 3.5 that we attribute to the over - estimation by the models of the pulsation duration .",
    "the latter correction can not be much smaller than that  and , consequently , the survey incompleteness can not be much worse than stated above  as the mass - loss catastrophy that first triggered the inquest into the correction factor ( paper iii ) required a total correction of a factor 10 .",
    "( we expect that we need to seek to reduce the mass loss estimates by a factor 0.7 , for the mass - loss catastrophy to be avoided when adopting a correction to the number of variable stars of a factor 7 . )      as time passes , the metallicity of the ism  and hence that of new generations of stars  changes as a result of nucleosynthesis and feedback from dying stars .",
