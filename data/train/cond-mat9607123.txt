    "many experiments tell us that one of the low temperature states of the heavy fermion materials is a fermi liquid whose quasiparticle masses are @xmath4 to @xmath5 larger than those of the normal metals@xcite .",
    "it is commonly believed that the heavy fermi liquid state is one of the possible ground states of the kondo lattice model @xmath6 .",
    "the most popular description of the heavy fermion state is that below a characteristic temperature @xmath7 @xmath8 , the conduction electrons ( @xmath9electrons ) and the local moments ( @xmath10electrons ) have common excitations .",
    "this picture leads to the important fact that the localized spins also participate in the fermi surface @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the @xmath12 has a large area .",
    "de haas - van alphen measurements@xcite of some heavy fermion compounds have shown that the @xmath12 has a @xmath13 character .",
    "ab - initio local density approximation @xmath14@xcite computations of the band structure of heavy fermions also predict a large @xmath12 , although these calculations fail to reproduce heavy masses .",
    "these results are indeed expected from the luttinger theorem which states that the volume of the @xmath12 is unchanged by the electron - electron interaction .",
    "intuitively , however , it is not straigthforward to understand in the framework of the @xmath15 , how the @xmath13-electrons can be included in the @xmath16 since there is no explicit hybridization between the @xmath17-electrons and them .",
    "@xmath18 computations have shown the existence of a narrow @xmath13 bandwith which is due to hybridization@xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 itself is an effective model of the periodic anderson lattice @xmath19 in the limit of nearly integral valence and of strong coulomb correlation .",
    "one may thus wonder wether or not the residual @xmath13-electrons itinerant character present in the strong coupling limit of the @xmath20 plays a crucial role in the formation of the heavy fermi liquid state .",
    "analytical@xcite@xcite and numerical@xcite@xcite@xcite studies have focused on the @xmath12 of the @xmath21 @xmath15 .",
    "their results remain very controversial . in the following",
    ", we will study the @xmath21 @xmath15 numerically .",
    "a numerical study of the @xmath21 @xmath15 presents two essential difficulties .",
    "the first one arises from the very low energy scale of the kondo physics which requires the investigation of lattices of very large sizes . in real materials ,",
    "the heavy masses involve a very small value of the quasiparticle weight . for the @xmath21 model , in the physical range of parameters @xmath22 ,",
    "the size of the expected singularity in the electron momentum distribution @xmath23 is likely to be very small .",
    "the second problem is the occurrence of a ground - state phase transition from a paramagnetic @xmath24 state at weak couplings to a ferromagnetic @xmath25 state at strong couplings@xcite@xcite .",
    "therefore , the results of the strong coupling regime where the model converges more rapidly to the thermodynamic limit can not be extrapolated to the weak - coupling region where size effects are still significant even in very long chains .",
    "we will show that the study of a @xmath15 ( eq .",
    "1 ) in which the strong coupling regime is smoothly connected to the weak coupling one can give insight of the existence of a large @xmath12 for the usual @xmath15 .",
    "then , a careful analysis of the usual @xmath15 will be made .",
    "a large @xmath12 means that the fermi wave vector is located at @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the fermi wave vector of the @xmath9electrons only",
    ". we will consider the following @xmath15 :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a localized spin .",
    "the hopping integral @xmath31 is set to @xmath32 .",
    "a direct heisenberg exchange term between local moments @xmath2 is introduced here .",
    "we have recently argued@xcite that the occurence of a ferromagnetic phase transition in the @xmath15 in the strong coupling region is due to the fact that the @xmath33 interaction becomes ineffective .",
    "one would thus expect that a sufficiently strong antiferromagnetic heisenberg coupling between the local moments can stabilize a @xmath34 ground state . in the conventional @xmath15 , this term",
    "is usually omitted because typical lattice parameters in the heavy fermion compound are @xmath35 while the ionic radii of the @xmath13 ions are less than @xmath36 , so that the overlap between the @xmath13 orbitals is negligible",
    ". it should be noted that the strong @xmath37 regime of the hamiltonian @xmath38 is relevant in the study of high-@xmath39 materials . in this case , @xmath2 is the superexchange interaction between copper ions . the double occupancy in the @xmath9electron band is naturally suppressed by @xmath37 , so that one need not include an explicit repulsion term between these electrons .",
    "we have investigated hamiltonian @xmath38 using the density matrix renormalization group @xmath40 method@xcite .",
    "we have chosen an algorithm with open boundary conditions .",
    "we keep between @xmath41 and @xmath42 states in the two external blocks .",
    "these states are labelled by the @xmath43component of the total spin @xmath44 .",
    "the ground state corresponds to the lowest state with @xmath45 .",
    "the maximum truncation error is in the order of @xmath46 .",
    "although we have reached @xmath47 sites , the longest distance in the calculation of the correlation function is @xmath48 . because we have first built lattices of @xmath49 sites before we start to calculate the correlation functions .",
    "this way , we minimize the end effects and density fluctuations that are larger in the early steps of the algorithm .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath38 has _ a _ @xmath51 _  ground state with a luttinger fermi surface _",
    "when @xmath52 in the strong @xmath37 regime .",
    "we have chosen our value for the heisenberg coupling on the grounds that it is necessary that @xmath2 exceeds the effective @xmath53 coupling @xmath54 between the @xmath13 electrons to stabilize the @xmath34 ground state for all @xmath37 .",
    "our first choice was @xmath55 .",
    "for this value , we found that the ground state is @xmath34 in the weak @xmath37 region , @xmath53 for intermediate couplings , then @xmath34 for strong @xmath37 .",
    "we can estimate @xmath56 by using the results of the strong coupling expansion@xcite .",
    "@xmath57 is approximatively @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively for the partial band - fillings @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "then , knowing that the strong coupling region starts for @xmath37 of order @xmath32 , one obtains the upper bound , @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "our value of @xmath65 thus include a security factor . in fig.1",
    ", we show @xmath23 ( the fourier transform of @xmath66 ) for the band - fillings @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath23 at @xmath60 and @xmath62 are affected by density fluctuations , since the band - filling is not constant during the @xmath68 iterations .",
    "nevertheless , clean singularities are observed at @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the magnetic structure factor of the localized electrons @xmath72 ( the fourier transform of @xmath73 ) , shown in fig.2 , presents a maximum at @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "these values correspond to @xmath76 , since @xmath77 is greater than @xmath78 . clearly , neither the bare @xmath9electron nor the bare @xmath10electron signatures are detected .",
    "there are instead unique compound - particles propagating with a characteristic wave vector at @xmath79 .",
    "an analogy can be made with the hubbard model@xcite . at half - filling , in the @xmath80 limit ,",
    "all the conduction electrons form on - site singlets with the localized spins , so that the overall system is in a singlet state .",
    "the non half - filled cases correspond to the introduction of holes in the system .",
    "these holes which can hop from site to site are associated with the @xmath81 unpaired @xmath10electrons , @xmath82 being the number of @xmath9electrons .",
    "obviously , double occupancy of holes is forbidden : one has a @xmath83 hubbard model of @xmath84 hole density .",
    "depletion effects@xcite are also observed in fig.2 : the reduction of the conduction electron density increases the tendency to magnetism .",
    "the maximum of @xmath72 increases when @xmath85 decreases .",
    "now we wish to discuss how the system evolves when @xmath37 is reduced .",
    "we show in fig.3 @xmath23 at @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the height of the singularity at @xmath79 decreases as @xmath37 is reduced .",
    "concurrently the drop at @xmath27 which , was negligibly small in the strong @xmath37 case , increases . the @xmath9electron character is progressively enhanced . the local spin - spin correlation which is @xmath89 at @xmath90 , is equal to @xmath91 at @xmath67 and @xmath92 at @xmath93 .",
    "the deviation of this quantity from the perfect on - site singlet value @xmath94 means that the singlet clouds have a spatial extension at lower @xmath37 . at @xmath93 ,",
    "short - range effects coexist along with the long - range behavior of the system .",
    "clearly , it becomes hard to define the exact position of the @xmath12 .",
    "this can be better illustrated in @xmath72 ( fig.4 ) at @xmath86 .",
    "a new peak appears at @xmath95 at small @xmath37 , signaling short - range antiferromagnetic correlations . at @xmath96 ( not shown here ) , the peak at @xmath97 is not seen .",
    "we can no longer observe the long - distance behavior of the model because of the finite - size effects ( long correlation length ; see the discussion below ) . since there is no phase transition in the system , the weak and the strong @xmath37 regimes are continuously connected .",
    "we thus believe that _ the _ @xmath98 _  is large even at smaller _ @xmath37 .",
    "the above discussion is similar to the one made by kotliar in the framework of the @xmath20@xcite .",
    "the local singlets of the strong - coupling limit are obtained as the kondo resonances are pulled out of the @xmath9electron band by increasing @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath12 is conserved during this process .",
    "we now discuss if the above conclusions can be extended to the @xmath34 phase of the conventional @xmath15 . at first sight",
    ", one can argue that the conventional @xmath99 is adiabatically reached by taking the limit @xmath100 .",
    "thus the conventional @xmath15 may have a large @xmath12 in its @xmath34 phase .",
    "it should be noted from the above results and from the knowledge of the occurrence of a phase transition , that the range of @xmath37 in which we can expect to detect a large @xmath12 with numerical methods in the conventional @xmath15 is narrow .",
    "an estimation of this range can be obtained by examining the kondo coherence length @xmath101 of the one - inpurity problem .",
    "@xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the fermi velocity and @xmath104 the kondo temperature .",
    "the observation of the long range properties of the model is only possible at distances @xmath105 .",
    "for @xmath106 finite size effects dominate , only short - range effects governed by the @xmath33 interaction will be observed .",
    "srensen and affleck have recently made an accurate computation of @xmath101@xcite .",
    "some typical values are @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "clearly , for @xmath110 the long - range behavior of the model is not attainable since the longest distance in our study is @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath53 transition occurs at @xmath111 for @xmath86 and @xmath112 for @xmath113 . at low band - fillings ,",
    "depletion effects enhance the @xmath53 instability .",
    "the @xmath34 phase boundary is shifted towards weak couplings where @xmath101 becomes very large .",
    "hence , at quater filling where there is no density fluctuations , this range is very narrow .",
    "thus we have chosen to study the @xmath15 at @xmath113 in the range @xmath114 . in ref.@xcite , we have found that @xmath23 displays a sharp drop at @xmath27 and @xmath72 presents a maximum at @xmath115 in the small @xmath37 regime . as @xmath37 was increased , these features vanished before the phase transition was reached .",
    "but we were unable to draw a firm conclusion about the location of the @xmath12 .",
    "a more careful analysis will now show that we had observed a short - range effect governed by the @xmath33 interaction .",
    "furthermore , we will identify the true long - range properties of the model which are not easily observable . in fig.5",
    ", we display @xmath72 at @xmath113 for @xmath116 and @xmath117 . starting from @xmath118",
    ", we can only detect the @xmath33 maximum at @xmath119 . for @xmath96 ,",
    "the maximum of @xmath72 is still located at the @xmath33 wave vector .",
    "but one can also observe a local maximum at the position of the large @xmath12 at @xmath120 . at @xmath121 and @xmath88 ,",
    "the height of the @xmath33 maximum decreases .",
    "at the same time , the height of the maximum at @xmath77 increases .",
    "this trend is unambigously confirmed at @xmath122 , where the maximum at @xmath77 is now the highest .",
    "the height of these maxima however , is still smaller than the one at @xmath115 for @xmath123 in ref @xmath124 $ ] , and are thus harder to detect .",
    "finally , @xmath23 , shown in fig.6 , corroborates the existence of the large @xmath12 in the @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath23 drops monotonously when @xmath125 , shows a small plateau just before @xmath126 , and then drops abruptly at @xmath127 .",
    "the width of the plateau shrinks and then becomes undetectable when @xmath37 is decreased . at the same time , the drop at @xmath27 is enhanced indicating that the short range effects are becoming dominant .",
    "this is consistent with the results for @xmath128 .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the @xmath15 with a direct exchange heisenberg coupling has a large @xmath12 in the strong kondo coupling limit .",
    "we have shown that this phase is continously connected to the weak kondo coupling regime . as a consequence , the latter model has a large @xmath12 in the small coupling regime .",
    "the conventional @xmath15 can continously be reached by taking the limit of vanishing heisenberg coupling .",
    "we have concluded from this that its @xmath12 should have a large area in its @xmath34 phase .",
    "direct numerical computations made on the @xmath15 support the existence of a large @xmath12 . the height of the singularity in the electron momentum distribution decreases and becomes very small as the kondo interaction goes towards the weak coupling region .",
    "these features are however very hard to observe .",
    "a more accurate study is certainly needed to confirm our conclusions .",
    "finally , the nature of the heavy quasiparticles appear to be different from that proposed in the renormalized band structure studies@xcite . in the renormalized band picture",
    ", the heavy quasiparticles result from the small hybridization between the conduction electrons and the renormalized @xmath10bands pinned at the fermi level of the conduction electron sea .",
    "this requires the number of @xmath13-electrons per site to be sligthly less than one .",
    "our results suggest that these are instead loosely bound states made up of conduction electrons and @xmath129spin fluctuations .",
    "this is consistent with recent results from field theory@xcite and exact diagonalization@xcite .",
