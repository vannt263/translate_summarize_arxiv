    "as a ubiquitous phenomenon in microscopic world , decoherence is a main obstacle to the realization of any applications of quantum coherence , e.g. , quantum information processing @xcite , quantum metrology @xcite , and quantum simulation @xcite .",
    "many methods , such as feedback control @xcite , decoherence - free subspace encoding @xcite , and dynamical decoupling @xcite , have been proposed to beat this unwanted effect .",
    "the dynamical decoupling scheme can be generally described by the so - called spectral filtering theory in the first - order magnus expansion @xcite , which is valid when the control pulses are sufficiently rapid .",
    "based on the spin echo technique , this scheme is widely exploited to suppress dephasing @xcite , where the system has no energy exchange with the environment , and classical noises @xcite .",
    "it requires a high controllability to the system due to its sensitivity to the time instants at which the inverse pulses are applied @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when dissipation and quantum noises are involved , it generally can not perform well .",
    "although the dissipation control was partially touched in the original form of the spectral filtering theory @xcite , whether the first - markovian approximation used there can capture well the physics for such time - dependent systems is still an open question .",
    "this is because that new time scales would be introduced to the systems by the time - dependent control field , which might invalidate the application of the markovian approximation .    as a main inspiration",
    ", we notice that the decoherence of dissipative systems connects tightly with the energy - spectrum characters of the total system consisting of the system and its environment @xcite .",
    "if a bound state residing in the energy bandgap of the whole system is formed by changing the environmental spectral density , the decoherence of the system can be suppressed .",
    "thus one can artificially engineer the bound state to suppress decoherence of quantum emitters by introducing spatial periodic confinement in a photonic crystal setting @xcite . here the spatial periodic confinement dramatically alters the dispersion relation of the radiation field of the quantum emitter such that a certain bandgap structure is present in the spectral density .",
    "if the frequency of the quantum emitter resides in the bandgap region , then a bound state is formed and thus the decoherence of the emitter can be suppressed . however , in practical solid - state systems , one generally faces that it is hard to manipulate the spectral density via changing the spatial confinement once the material of system is fabricated .",
    "thus a more efficient way in engineering the bound state than changing the spectral density is desired .",
    "recently , temporal periodic driving has become a highly controllable and versatile tool in quantum control .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to explore non - trivial effects induced by periodic driving on physical systems .",
    "it has been proven to play profound role not only in controlling single - quantum - state of microscopic systems @xcite and implementing geometric phase gates in quantum computation @xcite , but also in generating novel states of matter absent in the original static system @xcite .",
    "different from static systems , periodically driven systems have no stationary states because the energy is not conserved . due to floquet theory , they have well - defined quasi - stationary - state properties described by the floquet eigen - values , which are called quasienergies .",
    "the distinguished role of periodic driving in these diverse systems is that the versatility of driving schemes can induce more colorful quasi - stationary - state behaviors than the static case by controlling the quasi - energy spectrum .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility of periodic driving on engineering the bound state of a spin-1/2 system interacting with a xx - type coupled spin bath . via manipulating the quasi - energy spectrum by periodic driving , we find that a floquet eigenstate with discrete quasienergy , which we name a floquet bound state ( fbs ) , can be formed within the bandgap of the quasienergy spectrum .",
    "we further reveal that the presence of the fbs would dynamically cause the dissipation of the system spin inhibited .",
    "the result suggests that we can manipulate the periodicity in a temporal domain instead of the one in a spatial domain to suppress decoherence , which relaxes greatly the experimental difficulty in fabricating periodic confinement in a photonic crystal .",

    "for a static two - level system @xcite or a harmonic oscillator @xcite interacting with an environment , depending on the parameters in the spectral density , the total system may possess a stationary state named a bound state @xcite localized out of the continuous energy band of the environment . as a stationary state ,",

    "there are several methods in the literature to explore the effects of periodic driving on quantum systems .",
    "for example , via neglecting the coupling between different temporal subspaces of the floquet eigenequation in the high - frequency driving condition , it was shown that the periodic driving can induce the suppressed tunneling of a quantum particle , a phenomenon called coherent destruction of tunneling @xcite , and the decoupling between open system and its environment @xcite .",

    "second , we emphasize that , our mechanism is substantially different from the spectral filtering theory @xcite .",

    "<S> our protocol is robust against the fluctuation of control parameters and easy to realize in practice . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests a promising perspective of periodic driving in decoherence control . </S>"
