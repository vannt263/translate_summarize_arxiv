    "the subject of complex networks has recently caused a rapid surge of interest and already quite a few reviews have surfaced @xcite . while a large effort has been devoted to undirected networks , comparatively less attention has so far been payed on modeling directed networks . on the other hand , there exist also many different types of real directed networks from various realm of science@xcite .",
    "the directed networks - models discussed in the present paper structurally resembles two examples from biology i.e.  metabolic networks @xcite and transcriptional networks @xcite .",
    "these two types , while being structurally rather different , both display a broad out - degree distribution .",
    "the scale - freeness of the degree - distributions has been a central issue in the network research @xcite .",
    "typical questions we can ask are : does the feature of broad degree distributions observed in real networks suggest a common cause ? or does the broad distributions arise in a variety of ways , implying that no common cause exists ? can directed networks with scale - free degree distributions be subdivided into `` universality classes '' based on relations between in and out - degrees in the networks ?    in the first step we try to find local organizational update rules , which automatically generate directed networks with broad scale - free - like degree - distributions .",
    "we present two such local rules which we term _ friendly _ and _ hostile _ merging .",
    "we further characterize the two emerging types of directed scale - free networks by measures connected to the relative amount of and the relations between in- and outgoing links .",
    "we notice that directed networks have more characteristic features than undirected ones which make it easier to detect differences between them .",
    "next we introduce two minimalistic random network models which display features reminiscent of the two types of networks obtained from , respectively , _",
    "friendly _ and _ hostile _ merging .",
    "we clarify the similarities and differences and suggest that the common overall features can be described in terms of two distinct prototypes of directed scale - free - like networks .",

    "here @xmath12 is the number of links which the nodes @xmath1 and @xmath0 have to common neighbors ( including the one to each other ) .",
    "since only at most one link of each direction between two different nodes are allowed , these in- and out - degrees disappear .",
    "this reflects the efficiency gain in the merging step . *",
    "_ balance step _ : add a new node with degree zero , @xmath13 , and then add @xmath14 links that connect randomly into the system .",
    "this step ensures that the number of nodes is constant and that the number of links reaches an equilibrium value after going through the updating steps many times .",

    "we instead consider the nodes as boxes of certain sizes ( degrees ) , @xmath35 , and with the size distribution @xmath36 .",
    "we then put in red and blue balls ( respectively , in- and out - links ) into the boxes until they are filled .",
    "in such a case the average number of in - links ( red balls ) on a node with precisely @xmath37 out - links ( blue balls ) , @xmath38 , is just given in terms of the binomial distribution @xmath39 i.e.  the probability to get @xmath32 tails when tossing a coin @xmath40 times :    @xmath41    where @xmath35 is the total number of links attached to a node ( so that @xmath42 ) , and @xmath43 is the largest node in the network . here",
