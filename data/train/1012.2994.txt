    "solid - to - solid phase transitions can be of different nature : diffusive and displacive .",
    "diffusive transformations are second order phase transitions , and are able to describe , among others , processes involving diffusion of atoms .",
    "typical examples include spinodal decomposition , vapour - phase deposition , crystal growth during solidification and grain growth in single - phase and two - phase systems .",
    "spinodal decomposition can occur , for instance , in an eutectoid steel : a diffusive transition from a high temperature stable phase , austenite ( fig.[fig : micros]a ) , to perlite ( fig.[fig : micros]b ) takes place at low cooling rate ; as the temperature decreases slowly , carbon ( the solute ) can migrate outside iron cell and originate cementite layers .",
    "displacive transformations are first order phase transitions involving a lattice distortion .",
    "typical examples include the martensitic transformation of shape memory alloys or martensitic transformation of quenched steels : here the displacive transformation from austenite to martensite ( fig.[fig : micros]c ) occurs at high cooling rate ; the temperature decreases fast , and there is no time for diffusive phenomena to take place so that the new phase originates with a lattice deformation .",
    "diffusive and displacive phase transitions are concurrently involved in many and very important industrial processes , such as the heat treatments of steel . in particular , in a steel subjected to a heat treatment there may be different zones in which , due to a different cooling rate , the transformations are of different kind , leading to different phases .",
    "a number of approaches may be adopted to model both the aforementioned phase transitions ; for instance , use of phenomenological laws can be made : brokate @xcite , following the approach proposed by hoemberg @xcite , presents a model constituted by the koistinen - marburger rule for the prediction of the martensitic phase fraction , the johnson - mehl formula for the estimate of the perlitic phase fraction , together with the scheil s additivity rule for non - isothermal conditions . however , in author s opinion , such an approach does not make clear the physics behind the phenomena involved .",
    "a different way to tackle the problem may consist in setting a framework in the context of nonlinear thermoelasticity including the ginzburg - landau theory of phase transitions @xcite , @xcite . following the phase - field approach ,",
    "a microstructure is identified by a variable named order parameter .",
    "the phase transitions rely on phase evolution equations ; constitutive laws are expressed as the derivatives of the helmholtz free energy density , which is given as a function of the order parameters .",
    "in particular , a ginzburg - landau theory was proposed by falk @xcite for the martensitic phase transition in shape memory alloys using an order parameter dependent on the strain tensor .",
    "the same idea has been developed by barsch et .",
    "@xcite to describe the microstructure of inhomogeneous materials and their proposed model has been extended to simulate martensitic structures in two- and three - dimensional domains . in the work by ahluwalia",
    "@xcite this theory is generalised to describe a two - dimensional square to rectangle martensitic transition in a polycrystal with more than one lattice orientation .",
    "other models which describe the martensitic transformation in a ginzburg - landau framework using a different order parameter not dependent on the strain tensor are proposed by levitas et .",

    "ginzburg - landau frameworks have also been applied to study diffusive phase transitions . in this context ,",
    "cahn @xcite presented a first model in the simplest case of diffusive phase transition without accounting for thermal effects .",
    "an extension to cahn s model is presented - among others - by alt et .",
    "@xcite ; in their paper the coupled phenomena of mass diffusion and heat conduction in a binary system subjected to thermal activation have been modelled .",
    "other models accounting for the mechanical aspects related to the diffusive phase transitions are the ones by onuki et .",
    "@xcite and fried et .",
    "al.@xcite .",
    "first attempts to study diffusive and displacive phase transitions together were made by rao et .",
    "@xcite and by levitas @xcite ; the same idea has been developed by bouville et .",
    "@xcite , who proposed a ginzburg - landau framework including the balance of linear momentum equation and the cahn - hilliard equation and analysed the effects of a volume change consequent to a diffusive or a displacive phase transformation .    in this paper ,",
    "an attempt to describe both displacive and diffusive phase transitions in a thermodynamically consistent framework is made ; the coupling between thermal , chemical and mechanical effects is accounted for , and a way to overcome the difficulties arising from the treatment of the gradient terms is proposed .",
    "three are the governing equations , presented as balance equations for observable variables : the balance of linear momentum , the cahn - hilliard equation as a solute mass balance @xcite and the heat equation ( balance of internal energy ) .",
    "the model is completed with a suitable description of the free energy .",
    "the analysis is reduced to a two dimensional setting , which is simpler than a three dimensional one , but still meaningful .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the outline of the paper is as follows : after explaining the choice of the order parameters for each transformation in sect.[ops ] , in sect.[balance ] balance equations are provided for linear momentum , solute mass and internal energy ; the first two will act as the evolution equations needed for a ginzburg - landau framework . in sect.[second - law ] the restrictions provided by the second law of thermodynamics are highlighted and its exploitation in the form of the clausius - duhem inequality is provided . in sect.[free energy ] the model is completed with the description of the helmholtz free energy density , which will allow an explicit form for the constitutive laws to be derived in sect.[explicit ] .",
    "the resulting model is a diffuse interface one , and this implies the presence of the gradient of the order parameters , which will put some issues regarding the exploitation of the second principle of thermodynamics ( sect.[second - law ] ) and the necessary high order boundary conditions , as highlighted in sect.[bcs ] .",
    "the paper ends drawing some conclusions .",
    "the model is set at a microscopic scale of observation which may be , for instance , a single - grain scale and relies on a number of order parameters to describe the different kinds of transformations involved . in order to account for the presence of three phases ( austenite , perlite and martensite ) , two order parameters playing as the unknowns of the problem may be introduced .      to account for diffusive phenomenon , an order parameter called @xmath0",
    "is set : @xmath1 being @xmath2 a two - dimensional domain .    this parameter describes the evolution from one phase to another one with a different structure . according to experimental observations and the use of the cahn - hilliard equation @xcite ( see sect.[balance ] ) , the order parameter may represent the solute mass fraction .",
    "hence , pearlite , and in general phases obtained by diffusive transformations , will be the one for which this order parameter is non - zero , i.e. the carbon has migrate to generate areas in which there is a great quantity @xmath3 in spite of other areas , in which there is a lack of carbon @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the higher value @xmath0 will assume in a point of the domain , the more the transformation will be at a late stage there .",
    "given this interpretation , the cahn - hilliard equation may be seen as a balance of mass equation .      regarding martensitic phase formation , a shear strain needs to be applied to the lattice in order to obtain the phase change @xcite , @xcite . for this reason , in considering displacive phenomena ,",
    "the common choice for the order parameter , called @xmath5 , in a two - dimensional setting @xcite @xcite @xcite is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the linearised strain tensor and @xmath8 is the displacement field .",
    "we start the description of the model by stating the balance equations and then by examining the restrictions imposed by the second law of thermodynamics . we will last enter appropriate constitutive hypothesis by choosing a constitutive law for the free energy .",
    "the model consists of three balance equations , reported here in their pointwise formulation :    * balance of linear momentum : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the stress tensor and @xmath11 is the external body force ; * balance of solute mass : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the flux vector related to the solute mass fraction ( @xmath14 is its the velocity ) ; * balance of energy : @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the internal energy density , @xmath17 is the mechanical internal power ( density ) , @xmath18 is the internal power associated to the solute mass balance equation and @xmath19 is the internal thermal power .",
    "this can be expressed by the thermal power balance @xmath20 @xmath21 being the heat flux and @xmath22 the external heat supply .",
    "the balance of linear momentum and of solute mass give rise to two power balance equations .    to account for non - local effects and spatial variations of the order parameters ( interfaces )",
    ", we demand a non - local constitutive relation for stress and chemical potential .",
    "some cares are needed due to the presence of non - localities in the constitutive equations , as this will lead to non - conventional expressions for the internal powers associated to momentum and solute mass balance .    for the time being it suffices to consider this relation in the quite generic form @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the local state variables and @xmath25 is the full set of state variables moreover , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are supposed to be symmetric second order tensors . the dependence upon @xmath28 accounts for possible dissipative contributions to the local stress ; we will not consider dissipative contributions to the non local part of the stress .",
    "the balance of mechanical power is obtained by multiplying the balance of linear momentum equation by @xmath29 , which leads to @xmath30 \\cdot { \\bm v}= \\\\      = -({\\bm\\sigma}_{loc } : \\dot{\\bm\\varepsilon}+ { \\bm\\sigma}\\vdots \\nabla \\dot{\\bm\\varepsilon } ) +      \\nabla \\cdot [ { \\bm\\sigma}\\cdot { \\bm v}+ { \\bm\\sigma } : \\dot{\\bm\\varepsilon } ] + { \\bm f}\\cdot { \\bm v},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] having enforced the symmetry condition for the tensors and therefore substituted @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "we interpret ( [ eqn : balance ] ) as a balance equation for the rate of change of kinetic energy and the _ internal and external _ ( mechanical ) powers : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is any sub - body , @xmath35 is the volume measure , @xmath36 the surface measure and @xmath37 the surface normal .",
    "we have used capital letters for the integrated powers , so that @xmath38 .",
    "the balance of mechanical power equation is expressed as @xmath39 now we consider the power associated to the balance of solute mass equation .",
    "we call @xmath40 the _ chemical potential _ , which is the variable conjugated to @xmath41 defining the power balance associated to ( [ eqn : bal - carbon ] ) : @xmath42 a constitutive expression function of @xmath43 for the chemical potential has to be given , as well as a non - local relation : @xmath44 we can rewrite ( [ eqn : mudotc ] ) as @xmath45 we define the internal and the external powers as follows : @xmath46 so that the balance of powers in the sub - volume @xmath34 is expressed as @xmath47 note that there is no energy related to a second order time derivative in the balance of solute mass equation .",
    "we will examine the restrictions entailed by the second law of thermodynamics in the form of the classical clausius - duhem inequality : @xmath48 by using the first law of thermodynamics ( balance of energy equation ) : @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 ) to eliminate the source term @xmath22 , and introducing the _ helmholtz free energy density _ @xmath51 , the clausius - duhem inequality can be expressed in the more convenient form ( _ reduced inequality _ ) @xmath52 by substituting the expressions for the internal powers and remembering that @xmath53 is a function of the variables @xmath54 , the inequality becomes @xmath55 where the subscripts represent partial derivatives .",
    "this inequality has to be satisfied for all processes @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath57 ( as well as @xmath53 ) depends only on the state , we obtain @xmath58 by considering processes with only @xmath59 different from zero .",
    "similarly , as also @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 are assumed state - dependent only , we have @xmath63 the entropy inequality is therefore reduced to @xmath64 } : \\dot{\\bm\\varepsilon}+ { \\bm j}\\cdot \\nabla\\mu    + \\frac{{\\bm q}}{t } \\cdot \\nabla t \\leq 0.\\ ] ] the current @xmath65 and the heat flux @xmath21 are in general functions of the state and the process . for our purposes",
    "it will be sufficient to make the following simple assumptions ensuring the exploitation of the inequality : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a positive definite fourth order tensor of which we provide an explicit formulation in sect .",
    "[ par : stress - cp ] , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are positive coefficients in general dependent on @xmath43 , more often only on the temperature @xmath70 .",
    "the subscript in the symbol @xmath71 stands for _ anelastic_. the presence of a dissipative term in the local stress provides a damping mechanism for the displacive transition , as showed in sect .",
    "[ res : displ ] .",
    "we point out that the chemical potential and the non - dissipative part of the stress can be written accounting for their local and non - local parts in terms of functional derivatives of a _ free energy functional _",
    "@xmath72 where @xmath2 is the material domain and @xmath35 the material volume measure",
    ". then , @xmath73 these definitions being consistent with the choice of the boundary conditions made in sect.[bcs ] .",
    "it is possible to substitute the constitutive relations in the equation for the internal powers , obtaining the following internal power density : @xmath74 besides , by using @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 so that ( [ eqn : fl ] ) can be rewritten in term of the free energy as @xmath77 this is a thermodynamically consistent framework which will be substantiated with a convenient choice of the free energy @xmath53 ( sect.[free energy ] ) .",
    "since constitutive equations have been determined by means of derivatives of the free energy , the choice of this latter is a convenient way to characterise the constitutive content of the model .",
    "there are two main phenomena involved in the discussion : the diffusive and the displacive transitions , which have to be accounted for at the same time ; this is done by exploiting the additivity property of the energy .",
    "the free energy density is written as the sum of different contributions : @xmath78 where :    * @xmath79 is a term accounting for the background thermal properties of the material ( contributing to specific heat ) ; * @xmath80 is a term accounting for the dilatation due to phase transitions and for the contribution of the shear strain ; * @xmath81 , which is a function of @xmath82 , accounts for the displacive transition ; * @xmath83 , which is a function of @xmath0 , accounts for the diffusive transition ; * @xmath84 is a coupling term for the interaction between the two phases ; * @xmath85 is a gradient term and accounts for non - local properties and spatial variations of the order parameter .    in the ginzburg - landau theory of phase transitions , it is assumed that the free energy density admits a power series expansion with respect to an order parameter .",
    "the diffusive part of the free energy may be postulated as follows @xcite : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a constant . the function @xmath88 is given by : @xmath89 with @xmath90 constant and @xmath91 the temperature of perlitic phase transition .    in fig.[fig",
    ": diff_free_energy ] , @xmath83 as a function of @xmath0 is depicted for various values of temperature . at high temperature",
    "there is only one stable phase identified as the minimum for @xmath92 , while at low temperature a different stable phase appears for values of @xmath0 starting from @xmath93 for @xmath94 and increasing for decreasing temperature .",
    "the transition occurs without hysteresis , i.e. with a continuous variation of the order parameter .",
    "the displacive part of the free energy may be postulated as follows @xcite , @xcite : @xmath95 being @xmath96 , @xmath97 constants .",
    "the function @xmath98 is given by : @xmath99 with @xmath100 constant and @xmath101 the temperature of martensitic phase transition .",

    "another phase become stable , as the free energy shows two minima . below the critical temperature ,",
    "the phase corresponding to the order parameter equal to zero is unstable , whilst the other one , corresponding to non - zero values of @xmath82 , is stable .",
    "note that , as @xmath82 describes a first order phase change , the transition between the phases occurs with a jump in the order parameter .",
    "the expression of @xmath80 is the one for the free energy accounting for the dilatation due to phase transitions @xcite @xcite , changes in temperature and for the contribution of the shear strain . @xmath104 being @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 constants .",

    "the constitutive laws of stress and chemical potential can be put in an explicit form .",
    "it is useful to introduce the following notation : @xmath119 the stress tensor can now be written as @xmath120 where the local part is given by four contributions : @xmath121 with @xmath122 as it regards the conservative contributions ; for the dissipative term , we assume @xmath123 which amounts to consider @xmath124 . in this way , we consider a dissipative term associated only to the displacive order parameter @xmath82 ; its effect is to dim the time oscillations in the order parameter after the displacive transition .",
    "the chemical potential is the following : @xmath125 where @xmath126 these expressions have to be substituted in the first two equations of system ( [ eqn:3bal ] ) .",

    "the given expression of the heat equation allows to identify the thermo - chemical and the thermo - mechanical coupling terms ( contained in the second term of eq .",
    "[ eqn:3bal]@xmath130 ) , which contribute to the changes in temperature during a phase transition , and the chemical and mechanical dissipations , respectively @xmath131 and @xmath132 , which act as heat sources when a displacive or a diffusive transition occurs .",

    "the equations of the model are the balance of linear momentum equation , the cahn - hilliard equation and the heat equation ; the first two are the evolution equations for the two order parameters ; the heat equation accounts for thermal effects like cooling or heat released due to a phase change .",
