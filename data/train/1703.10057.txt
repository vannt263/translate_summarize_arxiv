    "in the @xmath0 century it was first realized that it is not nuclear fusion but actually gravity which powers most of the luminous objects in our universe .",
    "the mechanism by which gravity does this is the accretion of matter onto gravitating bodies . of course stronger gravitating bodies",
    "are bound to be more effective in releasing more gravitational power .",
    "it is thus obvious that the accretion of matter onto black holes , which are known to be the strongest gravitating objects in the universe , is responsible for the high - energy flux from active galactic nuclei and quasars .",
    "the investigations of the accretion processes onto celestial objects were initiated by hoyle and lyttleton in 1939 @xmath1 , later studies were carried out by bondi and hoyle @xmath2 for a pressure - less gas falling onto a moving star .",
    "subsequently , a theory of stationary , spherically symmetric and transonic hydrodynamic accretion of adiabatic fluid onto a gravitating astrophysical body at rest was formulated in a seminal paper by bondi in 1952 @xmath3 , in a purely newtonian way .",
    "this calculation included the effect of pressure of the in - falling material .",
    "thereafter a large body of literature has been devoted to the theoretical and observational studies of accretion processes ( see for example the standard texts @xmath4 ) .",
    "the general relativistic treatment of the problem of steady - state spherically symmetric flow of a test gas onto a schwarzschild black hole was initiated in @xmath5 . there",
    "the equations of motion for steady - state spherically symmetric flow of matter into ( or out ) of a black hole had been solved for simple polytropic gases .",
    "it was argued that infalling matter would be heated to temperatures as hot as @xmath6k and the resulting x - ray luminosities were shown to be of the order of @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "further , comprehensive analysis has also been carried out to compute the luminosity and frequency spectrum @xmath9 and study the influence of an interstellar magnetic field on the accretion of ionized gases @xmath10 .",
    "aspects of matter accretion onto a charged black hole that was originally considered in @xmath5 , was more elaborately investigated in @xmath11 .",
    "studies involving spherical winds and shock transitions were carried out in @xmath12 .",
    "efforts to understand the influence of back - reaction on the phenomenon of accretion can be found in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "moreover , in recent times , accretion of a hypothetical phantom fluid onto black holes has been investigated in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the increasing recognition of the importance of accretion has accompanied the dramatic expansion of observational techniques in astronomy , in particular it helps in explaining the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum from the radio to x - rays and @xmath13-rays .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that not only in the large length scale but even in the planck scale the phenomenon of accretion may lead to provide important insights in testing the physical principles .",
    "indeed , aspects of mini black holes are becoming an important topic of research , since it is speculated that they may be produced at the large hadron collider .",
    "if this really happens then even a shortly existing thermal environment around such mini black holes may lead to some new features in the process of accretion .",
    "a few initiatives had actually been taken in this direction , namely , the investigation of accretion phenomenon in higher dimensional spherically symmetric black holes @xmath14 and in a background string cloud model @xmath15 .",
    "it was shown in @xmath14 that the accretion rate decreases with increase in the dimension of spacetime . in the background string cloud model @xmath15",
    ", it was observed that the matter accretion rate increases with the increasing string cloud parameter . in @xmath16",
    "quantum gravity corrections has been included in the process of matter accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "noncommutative geometry @xmath17 has been a very active area of research because of its direct relevance in planck scale physics .",
    "the idea of noncommutative spacetime @xmath18=i\\vartheta_{\\mu \\nu }   \\label{noncomm_rln}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is an antisymmetric matrix representing the fundamental cell discretization of spacetime , was first put forward formally in @xmath20 but was largely ignored .",
    "it gained importance from string theory which pointed out that target spacetime coordinates become noncommuting operators on d - brane @xmath21 .",
    "in this paper we study the phenomenon of accretion around a noncommutative inspired schwarzschild black hole @xmath22 .",
    "this black hole metric was first put forward in @xmath23 .",
    "it resulted from the argument that point - like structures get replaced by smeared objects due to noncommutativity @xmath24 .",
    "the effect of smearing is to use a gaussian distribution of minimal width @xmath25 in place of a position dirac - delta function .",
    "this observation resulted in choosing the mass density of a static , spherically symmetric , smeared , particle - like gravitational source as @xmath26 a justification of choosing the above form for the mass density was provided in @xmath27 . there",
    "the importance of the voros product in defining the mass density was elaborated . in this paper",
    "our aim is to find the effect of the noncommutative parameter @xmath28 on the matter accretion rate .",
    "we further investigate the effect of noncommutativity on the sonic radius , the speed of sound and also the thermodynamic profiles of the accreting gas , namely , the gas density and the gas temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we deduce the general equations for spherically symmetric accretion of matter onto a noncommutative inspired schwarzschild black hole . in section 3 ,",
    "the sonic point is determined for this metric . in section 4",
    ", we obtain a polytropic solution to the accretion rate of matter and also carry out numerical calculations .",
    "the thermodynamic profiles of the accreting fluid is analyzed in the sub - bondi regime in section 5 and at the event horizon in section 6 .",
    "we conclude in section 7 .",
    "we now present the basic equations describing the phenomenon of spherical accretion to investigate the flow of gas onto the noncommutative(nc ) inspired schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the noncommutative inspired schwarzschild black hole metric is given by @xmath23 @xmath29 + where @xmath30 and @xmath13 is the incomplete gamma function @xmath31 our aim is to find how the noncommutativity of spacetime affects the matter accretion rate @xmath32 onto the nc inspired schwarzschild black hole , the asymptotic compression ratio and the temperature profiles below the sonic radius and at the event horizon .",
    "we follow the approach developed in @xmath5 to tackle the problem of relativistic spherical accretion .",
