    "element abundance variations observed in the solar corona and wind with respect to those determined for the solar photosphere have proved to be one of the most enduring mysteries of solar physics of the past 15 - 20 years .",
    "the most commonly observed fip ( first ionization potential ) effect refers to the case where elements with first ionization potential below about 10 ev are observed to be enhanced in abundance by a factor of about 3 - 4 in the solar corona and in the slow speed solar wind .",
    "coronal holes and the fast speed solar wind which emanates from them by contrast show no such fractionation .",
    "models for such phenomena have come and gone .",
    "early diffusion models based on ion coupling to a background flow of protons @xcite were shown either to be based on somewhat artificial boundary conditions @xcite , or inherently too slow @xcite .",
    "the first fip effect model to include an external forces acting on the plasma ions that is worked out in some details is that due to @xcite , based on cross b thermoelectric fields associated with the downward electron flux which gives rise to chromospheric evaporation .",
    "the absence of a fip effect in coronal holes arises naturally , but in coronal regions where fip fractionation occurs , a mass dependence is predicted which is not observed .",
    "more recently two distinct possibilities have been discussed in the literature .",
    "@xcite proposed that reconnection events in the chromosphere heat ions and not neutrals , the higher ion scale heights then leading to enhanced coronal abundances for those elements which are ionized in the chromosphere , the low fip elements .",
    "a fractionation by a factor of 3 - 4 arises naturally out of this model ; if the reconnection is driven any harder , chromospheric heating ionizes all elements and the distinction between high and low fip elements is lost .",
    "this might be problematic , since higher fip fractionations are observed in discrete solar features @xcite .",
    "less satisfactory is that the difference between corona / slow wind and coronal holes / fast wind is not accounted for . in a qualitatively different approach , @xcite envisaged a wave heated coronal loop where waves penetrate down to the chromosphere at each footpoint and there selectively heat the ions but not the neutrals , again leading to a positive fractionation of the low fip species .",
    "we remark that the precise nature of the wave heating in their model remains obscure .",
    "ions are heated to a constant velocity , the wave phase speed , by isotropic waves .",
    "this would suggest a resonant ion cyclotron heating mechanism .",
    "it seems to us that sufficient energy in these waves is unlikely to reach the partially ionized layer of the chromosphere , due to the intrinsically small amount of energy generally believed to reside in high frequency waves , and the damping they would undergo in the partially ionized chromosphere @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider below the effect of nonresonant waves on chromospheric ions , through the action of the ponderomotive force that must exist as alfvn waves propagate through the chromosphere , either as initially upwards propagating waves impinging on the corona from below , or downward propagating coronal waves impinging of the chromosphere from above .",
    "the difference between corona / slow wind and coronal hole / fast wind abundances arises quite naturally in this model , in that waves on closed loops inevitably return to loop footpoints unless damped or reflected higher up , but waves on open field lines do not . in common with @xcite , @xcite only produce a positive fip fractionation , i.e. only enhancements in abundance of low fip ions .",
    "this last point has become of great interest with the advent of element abundance measurements in stellar coronae .",
    "@xcite reviewed the observational situation prior to the launch of chandra and xmm - newton . at that time",
    ", coronal abundance patterns showed a trend of increasing metal depletion with increasing activity for the most active stars , going from fip effects in single stars of solar - like activity , through higher activity stars with essentially no coronal abundance anomaly , right up to the most active stars with values of the coronal fe / h abundance _",
    "lower _ than solar photospheric values by factors of up to about 3 , i.e. a depletion of an order of magnitude compared to low fip enhanced coronae like that of the sun .",
    "the lowest activity solar - like star , procyon , also showed no coronal abundance anomaly . with the advent of data from xmm - newton and chandra , the elemental abundance anomalies in active stellar coronae",
    "were revealed to be more akin to an inverse fip effect @xcite , in that while high fip elements are essentially unchanged relative to h , low fips are now depleted by typical factors of 1/3 .",
    "the transition from unfractionated to inverse fip fractionation with increasing stellar activity is illustrated by @xcite . while the ubiquity of the inverse fip effect remains controversial in many sources due to uncertainties in the underlying photospheric abundances ( see discussion in section 4 ) , it appears real enough in at least a few cases to deserve serious consideration . as will be seen in section 5 , an inverse fip effect",
    "can also be produced by ponderomotive forces , which is an encouraging sign .",
    "the ponderomotive force for alfvn waves has been derived from the term @xmath0 in the mhd momentum equation by @xcite .",
    "we work from a more general expression for the time - independent ponderomotive force on a particle of species @xmath1 , @xmath2 , given by @xcite ; @xmath3.\\ ] ] here @xmath4 are the terms in the dielectric tensor contributed by the species @xmath1 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the wave electric field and its complex conjugate , @xmath7 is the levi - cevita symbol , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the magnetic field , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the charge and mass of particles of species @xmath1 , @xmath12 is the speed of light , and @xmath13 is the wavevector . we will consider the simplest possible geometry for a loop footpoint for this initial study , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which means that @xmath5 has only perpendicular ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) components for alfvn or ion cyclotron waves propagating along @xmath9 .",
    "all plasma quantities are constant in the region of interest , except for @xmath18 , the particle density , and the ionization fraction of the various elements which may have gradients in the @xmath19 direction .",
    "this means that @xmath20 in the second term in equation 1 , giving @xmath21 , and hence this term drops out .",

    "hence @xmath43 , so the three terms in equation 4 are in the ratio @xmath44 : @xmath45 : @xmath46 . for low frequency nonresonant waves the first term always dominates , and hereafter we neglect the second two . as @xmath47",
    ", we recover the expression of @xcite . for wave intensity",
    "increasing upwards in the loop footpoint , the first term gives a force directed _ downwards _ on the ions if @xmath48 , and _ upwards _ if @xmath49 .",
    "the upwards force is proportional to mass , so the resulting acceleration is mass independent .",
    "the reason for such forces lies in the refraction of waves in a density gradient .",
    "all waves are refracted towards plasma regions with higher refractive index , which means regions of high density for low frequency waves and regions of low density for high frequency waves .",
    "the increased wave pressure in the region of high refractive index produces a force which pushes ions in the plasma towards regions of lower refractive index .",
    "this means that low frequency waves push ions to low density regions , i.e. upwards in a gravitationally stratified medium , and high frequency waves push ions towards high density region , i.e. downwards .",
    "close to a resonance @xmath50 , using @xmath51 , and so @xmath52.\\ ] ] both terms in general give an upwards force on the ions , unless @xmath53 .",
    "both positive and negative changes in the abundances of ions compared to those of neutrals in the partially ionized region of the chromosphere are possible in the scenario we discuss , but are generally negligible compared to the ponderomotive force due to nonresonant waves . in chromospheric plasma , waves of sufficiently high frequency to produce a downwards ponderomotive force or to resonate with ion gyrofrquencies are rapidly damped by charge exchange collisions @xcite , and so their effect on abundance fractionation is negligible .",
    "we follow in part the approach and notation of @xcite .",
    "consider first the motion of ions and neutrals of element @xmath1 in a background flow of protons and hydrogen with speed @xmath54 .",
    "we neglect the ambipolar force which is generally much less than gravity , and assume a flux tube of constant cross sectional area and magnetic field with height ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to write the momentum equations for ions and neutrals as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the partial pressures of ions and neutrals of element @xmath1 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the corresponding densities , @xmath60 and @xmath61 the collision rates with ambient gas ( assumed hydrogen and protons ) , @xmath62 and @xmath63 the flow speeds , and @xmath54 the hydrogen flow speed imposed on the loop .",
    "we also neglect an inertial term @xmath64 since the flow speed is much lower than particle thermal speeds .",
    "the momentum equations can be combined to give @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 the ionization fraction of element @xmath1 . for @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the mean molecular weight ,",
    "all elements are lifted by the background flow to the same scale height given by @xmath70 .",
    "this obviously requires @xmath71 ( assuming the term in @xmath72 negligible ) . for @xmath73 , we get gravitationally stratified solutions with @xmath74 . with @xmath75 cm s@xmath76 , and",
    "@xmath77 the former case is valid for the sun for flow speeds in the chromosphere greater than a relatively modest 10 - 100 cm s@xmath78 .",
    "the solar wind particle flux at @xmath79 is of order @xmath80 cm@xmath76s@xmath78 , which probably requires a flow speed well in excess of @xmath82 cm s@xmath78 at a density of @xmath83 @xmath84 ( accounting for an unknown area filling factor ) to supply it , so we do not expect gravitational separation of elements in the chromosphere .",
    "the solar chromosphere is doubtless a more dynamic environment than represented by equations 6 - 9 . for our purposes",
    "the net result of this dynamic behavior is merely to completely mix up the plasma to give uniform elemental composition with height , which is obtained in our model with the above choice for @xmath85 .",
    "other choices may be possible which would provide chemical fractionation in the unperturbed chromosphere , and one could choose @xmath85 to provide the required fip effect .",
    "however the physics behind such a specification for @xmath85 in most cases remains obscure , and is probably unrealistic , leading to an unsatisfactory explanation for the fip effect .",
    "problems of this sort abound in models where no external force provides the fip fractionation , as in e.g. @xcite .",
    "our model starts with a fully mixed chromosphere , upon which pondermotive forces due to alfvn wave reflection and transmission act to provide the fractionation .",
    "the low solar chromosphere is of much higher density than the upper layers where the fip fractionation will occur in our models .",
    "consequently the lower boundary condition of completely mixed photospheric composition material gives an essentially infinite particle `` reservoir '' to supply the extra fractionated elements .",
    "we now include a ponderomotive force , @xmath86 ( see equations 4 and 5 ) , on the ions in the momentum equations ; @xmath87 taking @xmath85 as specified above and assuming @xmath88 we find @xmath89 a quantitative assessment of coronal element abundances anomalies requires an evaluation of equation 12 with a realistic model chromosphere in the region of alfvn wave reflection . with @xmath90 ,",
    "the fractionation produced by the ponderomotive force is proportional to @xmath91 and is approximately mass independent if @xmath92 is dominated by the microturbulent velocity , as it must be if the unperturbed chromosphere is completely mixed with gravitational scale height corresponding to the mean molecular mass .",
    "henceforward we take @xmath90 , following the discussion in section 2 .",
    "the chromospheric reflection and damping of alfvn waves has recently been studied in some detail @xcite in connection with observations by trace of the damping of loop oscillations @xcite .",
    "waves with frequency below the ion - neutral charge exchange rate propagate essentially undamped through chromospheric plasma , but can be reflected at the chromosphere - corona boundary .    when the alfvn wavelength is much larger than the characteristic length scale over which the density changes , the amplitude reflection coefficient is given approximately by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the alfvn speeds of the incident and transmitted wave respectively .",
    "since @xmath96 is continuous across the boundary , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "these simple results are recovered in the long wavelength limit when the chromosphere is treated as an exponential atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the wave magnetic field in this case can be expressed in terms of hankel fuctions @xcite with argument @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the chromosphere scale height , @xmath101 is the chromospheric alfvn speed , in terms of its ( assumed constant ) coronal value @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the depth below the corona . when @xmath104 ( the long wavelength limit ) the expression can be simplified by expressing the hankel functions in terms of bessel functions and taking the appropriate limits when the arguments are much less than unity .",
    "the result is @xmath105\\exp\\left(i\\omega t\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath106 , @xmath107 is the longitudinal ( static ) magnetic field , @xmath108 is the radius of the assumed torsional oscillation , and @xmath109 and @xmath110 are complex constants representing the magnetic field amplitude of the upward and downward propagating chromospheric waves respectively .",
    "so long as the alfvn wave energy flux through the chromosphere is nonzero ( i.e. @xmath111 ) , with @xmath112 for solar parameters , @xmath113 and the wave energy density @xmath114 are essentially independent of @xmath19 in all regions except the lowest chromospheric levels . making the identification @xmath115 , for the wave energy density we deduce @xmath116 the ponderomotive acceleration is then @xmath117 cm s@xmath76 for @xmath118 erg @xmath84 , @xmath119 km and @xmath120 g @xmath84 .",
    "more realistic chromospheric models employed below @xcite have steeper density gradients in certain regions , giving even stronger ponderomotive acceleration . if sufficient cancelation exists between @xmath109 and @xmath110 so that the first term in equation 13 dominates , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , giving a ponderomotive force on ions directed downwards .",
    "the possibility that solutions of this type might play a role in the inverse fip effect is discussed in more detail below .",
    "we calculate the wave energy gradient using the results above in the model chromospheres of @xcite .",
    "atomic data for ionization and recombination rates are taken from the compilation of @xcite , including rates due to charge transfer recombination and ionization from @xcite .",
    "photoionization rates are evaluated using fits to cross sections in @xcite . at each layer of the chromosphere ,",
    "the average solar spectra of @xcite and @xcite are attenuated by absorption by atomic hydrogen , and then used to compute the photoionization rates for neutral species , which together with collisional ionization and recombination rates are used to calculate the ionization fractions of the various elements .",
    "plots of the ionization fraction of o , ne , si , and ar against height above the photosphere coming from our models are given as solid lines in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the long dashed line gives the h ionization fraction in the valc model , and the short dashed line gives the temperature in the model .",
    "all other low fip elements are virtually indistinguishable on this plot to si , i.e. all retain ionized fractions very close to unity for the range of heights shown .",
    "the o ionization balance follows that of h very closely because of the fast charge exchange rates between o and h. this is due to the close correspondence between their first ionization potentials .",
    "we evaluate equation 12 integrating the valc model , corresponding to average quiet sun , through the chromosphere .",
    "the ponderomotive acceleration is calculated from the gradient of the alfvn speed in the valc chromospheric model and equation 14 .",
    "this is not completely self - consistent , since equation 14 is derived assumed an exponential atmosphere , not the valc model , but should be adequate for the purposes of this paper .",
    "the ion - proton elastic collision rate is given by the standard spitzer formula and is numerically : @xmath123 collision rates where one or both particles are neutral are calculated from the effective cross sections given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and tabulated for reference in table 1 ) , assumed constant with proton or hydrogen velocity .",
    "formally , such behavior arises in the limit that the scattering particle wavefunction is much larger than the range of the scattering potential ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "previous authors @xcite have used formulae for ion - hydrogen and proton - neutral collision rates involving the static atomic polarizability which give collision rates larger by a factor typically about 2 . in equations 6 - 11 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "we estimate @xmath61 for other elements by scaling from values given in table 1 using tabulated values of static polarizabilities for neutral atoms of the various elements in @xcite .",
    "we give in table 2 the fip fractionation for a variety of elements computed for the valc background model for alfvn wave energy densities ranging between 0.01 and 0.1 ergs @xmath84 , corresponding to non - thermal mass motions of up to 10 km s@xmath78 at a density of @xmath131 @xmath84 . at an energy density of 0.04 ergs @xmath84",

    "in particular an almost mass independent fraction of around 3 occurs for mg , si , fe , and ni .",

    ", ar has the highest abundance enhancement of 1.25 .",
    "s is something of a special case , being the high fip element with the lowest fip of 10.36 ev .",
    "our model gives it an intermediate behavior , with a fip fractionation of 1.93 .",
    "al and ca are predicted to have similar mass independent fractionation to mg , si , and fe , whereas observations indicate a behavior more like na and k. this discrepancy would probably be resolved by improved atomic data for neutral - h collisions for these elements .",
    "we emphasize that given the background model and the atomic data , there is _ only one free parameter _ in all these models , namely the alfvn wave energy density .",
    "insignificant fractionation between h and he occurs in our model .",
    "the abundance ratio he / h has recently been measured in regions of quiet solar corona @xcite to be similar to that observed in the slow speed solar wind , i.e. in the range 0.04 - 0.05 instead of the value inferred for the solar envelope by helioseismology of 0.085 @xcite .",
    "the he / h abundance ratio in the solar wind is observed to be quite variable over the course of the solar cycle @xcite , and these variations are not present in the fip fractionation of other elements .",
    "consequently , one should not expect the physical mechanisms that produce the fip effect to be responsible for the he fractionation .",
    "different val models produce different fip fractionations . for 0.04",
    "ergs @xmath84 wave energy density , runs for the si fip fractionation which with valc is given in table 2 as 3.42 , vala gives 30.2 , valb 6.59 , vald 2.56 , vale 2.02 and valf give 1.69 .",
    "these models range from a dark point within a cell ( vala ) , an average cell center ( valb ) , average quiet sun ( valc),average network ( vald ) , a bright network element ( vale ) and a very bright network element ( valf ) .",
    "we have extended the elements we consider beyond the list of those usually of interest to spectroscopists to include kr , rb and w. modest increases in the wave energy density from that which gives the observed quiet sun fip fractionation produce enormous increases in the abundances of rb and w , which may be of relevance to element abundances in some impulsive solar energetic particle events .",
    "kr on the other hand , behaves like the other high fip elements .",
    "the @xmath132he abundance enhancements of factors @xmath133 in such events are relatively well known .",
    "more modest abundance enhancements of heavy elements are also seen , e.g. fe is observed enhanced relative to o by a factor @xmath134 over usual coronal abundances .",
    "this is usually interpreted as being due to more efficient stochastic acceleration of ions with lower charge to mass ratios , i.e. those ions with longer gyroradii .",
    "such acceleration occurs in the flare loop rather than in the chromosphere .",
    "going to elements heavier than fe , even stronger anomalies have recently been found @xcite .",
    "measurements with the wind / epact / lemt ( energetic particle acceleration , composition and transport / low energy matrix telescope ) instrument reveal elements with @xmath135 overabundant by a factor @xmath136 and those with @xmath137 overabundant by @xmath138 , relative to coronal values .",
    "these anomalies are similar in magnitude to those for @xmath132he .",
    "the ace / uleis ( advanced composition explorer / ultra low energy isotope spectrometer ) instrument reveals similar anomalies going out as far as bismuth ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "if these abundance anomalies were related to the fip effect under discussion here , we would expect @xmath140 bin to be dominated by the very low fip elements rb , sr , y , etc , with kr remaining essentially unchanged and the bin at @xmath141 to be dominated by cs and ba .",
    "some fip selectivity is evident around atomic masses corresponding to kr , rb , sr , etc in recent observations of sep ultra - heavy ions in impulsive solar flares ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 6 ) , but the data appear to be in better agreement with our computed values for wave energy densities around 0.04 ergs @xmath84 , rather than the higher values .",
    "data around xe , cs , and ba are noisier , but show essentially no fip selectivity .",
    "we emphasize that the degree of fractionation depends on the assumption that in the chromosphere unperturbed by alfvn wave reflection , these elements are sufficiently coupled to the background flow to rise up to the same gravitational scale height as h and the other elements , and that this might be questionable for these , the heaviest of the elements in our sample .",
    "some gravitational settling of heavy elements does appear to be in evidence in the solar photosphere and convection zone , as indicated by the disagreement between recent spectroscopic photospheric abundance measurements and determinations from helioseismology @xcite .",
    "before proceeding to discuss how variations of the fip fractionation , including the possibility of an inverse fip effect , might arise , we consider in more detail the properties of alfvn waves in the chromosphere .",
    "@xcite modeled the transmission of alfvn waves from the chromosphere into the corona using a three layer loop model ; a coronal midsection anchored in the chromosphere at each end .",
    "waves are fed in at one end , may undergo reflection or transmission each time they encounter a chromosphere - corona boundary , and can leak out of the other footpoint . in figure 3",
    "we show the transmission coefficient into the corona for upward propagating waves in the chromosphere ( lower panel ) .",
    "the results are calculated for a model with chromospheric scale height @xmath142 cm , coronal alfvn speed @xmath143 cm s@xmath78 , and loop length @xmath144 cm ( solid curves ) , and for a coronal hole where the limit @xmath145 is taken ( dashed curves ; hollweg s two - layer model ) .",
    "the upper panel shows the associated wave magnetic field at the corona - chromosphere boundary , in units of the initial upward wave amplitude @xmath109 expressed as a fraction of the unperturbed magnetic field strength @xmath96 and the radius of the torsional oscillation @xmath108 .",
    "the strongest wave magnetic field , and hence energy density and ponderomotive force , are clearly associated with the maxima in the alfvn wave transmission . from the difference in the plots for a closed loop and the coronal hole",
    ", we see that most of the waves responsible for the fip fractionation must be of relatively low frequency close to the loop fundamental near a period of 200 s , in order for different fractionations to appear in each case . at higher frequencies corresponding higher order harmonics of the loop ,",
    "the difference in wave magnetic field between the closed loop and coronal hole is rather small , and less obviously capable of producing different fractionations .",
    "the alfvn wave energy density represented by the plots in figure 3 is nearly 6 times higher in the closed loop than in the coronal hole assuming a flat wave spectrum between 10 and 1000 s periods . in the range between 100 and 1000 s period ,",
    "the closed loop has a factor 20 more wave energy density .",
    "with reference to table 2 , these differences are more than sufficient to produce the observed abundance differences .",
    "note that in each case we have assumed the same wave amplitude incident from below .",
    "if it is the case that the solar fip effect in coronal loops is due to the approximate equality of wave frequencies generated within the convection zone and hence the chromospheric alfvn wave spectrum ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the resonant frequencies of coronal loops , then a number of other predictions should follow . first , the fip enhancement in any particular solar loop should depend on its size .",
    "this does indeed appear to be the case , in that the small loops reaching maximum temperatures below @xmath146 k ( the unresolved fine structures * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) do have element compositions resembling the solar photosphere @xcite , whereas larger higher temperature loops show the usual fip effect .",
    "this is presumably because these smaller loops have resonant frequencies too high for efficient alfvn wave transmission to their higher temperature regions .",
    "further , the fip effect in stars of different spectral type might also show interesting variations from the solar case .",
    "stars of earlier type than the sun ( g2v ) will have shallower convection zones , and are generally thought to have lower coronal magnetic fields .",
    "consequently the chromospheric alfvn wave spectrum might be expected to be of higher frequency than that in the sun , while the resonant frequencies of coronal loops are lower , more similar to solar coronal holes .",
    "the observed absence of the fip effect in the corona of procyon ( f4iv ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is indicative of such an example .",
    "going to later spectral type than the sun , the deeper convection zones generate lower frequency chromospheric waves , but also higher coronal magnetic fields leading to a mismatch in the opposite sense , i.e. the coronal loop resonant frequency is higher than the chromospheric wave spectrum leading again to inefficient wave transmission and reduced abundance enhancements .",
    "fip effects reduced in magnitude compared to that in the sun , but not absent , are seen in @xmath147 eridani ( k2v ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) show similar fip fractionation to the solar corona .",
    "it is less clear what the correspondence between upward propagating chromospheric wave frequencies and resonant frequencies of coronal loops should be in interacting binary stars such as rscvn and algol - type binaries .",
    "observationally , the pre - chandra / xmm - newton view of essentially zero coronal abundance fractionation at the low end of the activity scale for these objects going over to inverse fip effect or metal depletion at the high reviewed by @xcite still holds true , with the caveat raised recently by @xcite , that fewer and fewer of these stars seems to exhibit true metal depletion in their coronae , the coronal abundance merely reflecting metal poor photospheres",
    ". however metal depleted coronae , or inverse fip effect , does appear to exist in some cases , e.g. ii peg ( k2iv plus an unseen companion ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ar lac ( g and k subgiants in a 1.98 day orbit ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ab dor ( k2 iv - v with a 0.515 day spin period ; * ? ? ?",
    "further , the variation of element abundance during stellar flares , in which initially metal depleted plasma evolves towards the standard composition , interpreted in terms of the chromospheric evaporation of unfractionated plasma to the coronal flare site , seems to require the existence of such abundance anomalies .",
    "such phenomena are observed in hr 1099 ( k1 iv and g5 iv ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , algol ( b8 v and k2 iv ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ux ari ( g5 v and k0 iv ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where the later type subgiant is taken to be the main source of coronal emission , as well as ab dor @xcite , yy gem ( dme and dme with 0.814 day orbit ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ii peg@xcite , and at mic ( dm4.5 and dm4.5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argues further that some coronal dissipation of the alfvn waves must exist , in order to overestimating the nonthermal line broadening .",
    "the inclusion of wave damping does not qualitatively change our considerations , except that for increased damping the difference in wave properties between coronal holes and closed loops becomes smaller . only at wave damping rates beyond the validity of hollweg s analytic treatment does this difference actually disappear .    in figure 4 we plot the variation of the wave electric field ( upper panel ) and magnetic field ( lower panel ) with distance through the chromosphere below the corona .",
    "a positive gradient of wave electric field gives an upwards ponderomotive force , and is realized in all cases close to the coronal boundary . at a wave period of 207 s , corresponding to the loop fundamental frequency ,",
    "the upwards force is strongest and is present at all heights . for most chromospheric heights the off resonant waves , corresponding to the magnetic field minimum at wave period 408 s gives decreasing wave electric field with increasing height , which would lead to a downwards ponderomotive force on the ions",
    "this is discussed further below in the subsection on the inverse fip effect .",
    "away from these two limiting cases , the chromospheric wave fields generally show negative gradient of electric field at low heights and a positive gradient higher up . in our simulations above with hopefully more realistic chromospheric density profiles coming from val models , most fip fractionation occurred within 200 km of the chromosphere - corona boundary , and so we should expect a closed loop excited by a broad spectrum of alfvn waves below to generally show a positive fip enhancement .",
    "however it is not absolutely clear that the top of the chromosphere in val models can be identified with the chromosphere - corona boundary in hollweg s model , which really marks a transition from an exponentially stratified atmosphere to a uniform density corona , and might reasonably be taken to indicate the top of the transition region instead .",
    "we now consider possibilities arising with wave reflection in the chromosphere to produce a so - called inverse fip effect .",
    "we mentioned above that high frequency waves from the corona capable of producing a downwards ponderomotive force on ions are likely to be heavily damped by charge exchange in the partially neutral chromosphere .",
    "even the lower charge exchange rates in molecular as opposed to atomic gas do not allow sufficient ponderomotive forces , even for wave energy densities in the range up to 1 erg @xmath84 .",
    "further , a ponderomotive acceleration produced by such waves would not in general be mass independent , in conflict with observations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we instead turn our attention to the most direct `` inverse '' of the model outlined above .",
    "alfvn waves coming up from the stellar convection zone can be reflected back down again unless they are of the precise frequency to be transmitted all the way into the corona @xcite . taking the corona - chromosphere boundary in hollweg s model to represent the true top of the chromosphere ,",
    "then to have a downwards ponderomotive force just below this region , we require from equation 13 an almost zero net alfvn wave energy flux through the chromosphere , i.e. complete reflection at the chromosphere - corona boundary to give @xmath152 . in this case the wave energy density @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the gradient of @xmath155 is now directed downwards , @xmath156 giving the ponderomotive force necessary for an inverse fip effect .",
    "this cancellation between these two terms is the origin of the inverse fip effect found above at the wave period of 408 s corresponding to the minimum wave magnetic field . from equation 13",
    ", we see that we require @xmath157 which for a chromosphere similar to that of the sun ( @xmath158 ) requires cancelation between @xmath12 and @xmath159 to an accuracy of @xmath160 close to @xmath161 , where most fractionation occurs in our models .",
    "this cancelation condition requires an almost complete reflection of waves upon first encountering the corona from below , which can be shown analytically and numerically to practically never occur within hollweg s model .",
    "the cancelation condition may only be achieved if waves are fed in from each chromospheric footpoint with the same amplitude and phase .",
    "this is probably more likely in stars with lower gravity , and hence larger chromospheric scale heights , where the degree of cancelation required is significantly lower .",
    "a further condition required to achieve wave cancellation in the chromosphere with waves fed in from both footpoints is that there should be negligible wave dissipation in the corona .",
    "@xcite shows that in the solar case some coronal wave dissipation is necessary to avoid predicting unrealistically high non thermal line broadening .",
    "we speculate that chromospheric incident waves with lower frequencies relative to those in the sun will need to turbulently cascade to higher relative frequencies to dissipate if the coronal magnetic field is higher , and that this extra decade or two in frequency reduces the dissipation to sufficiently low levels .",
    "constraints on non thermal line broadening are much less stringent in stars exhibiting the inverse fip effect , due to their rapid rotation .",
    "we speculate that a more realistic chromospheric density and alfvn wave profile would yield a more robust inverse fip effect .",
    "in particular , if the region of fip or inverse fip fractionation could be identified not with the region just below the chromosphere - corona boundary in hollweg s model , but lower down ( i.e. @xmath162 instead of @xmath163 ) then downwards ponderomotive forces could be more prevalent .",
    "stars with copious low frequency alfvnic turbulence could then routinely show inverse fip effects .",
    "this would obviate the need for waves being fed into both loop footpoints , and reduce the degree of cancellation required between upward and downward propagating waves .",
    "such turbulence is likely to derive from differential rotation of the envelope rather than from convection , in order to provide the necessary low frequency waves , and to match the observational constraint that inverse fip effects generally appear only in rapidly rotating stars .",
    "we close this section by commenting that @xcite also give a mechanism for inverse fip effects .",
    "the combination of upwards force due to the partial pressure of neutrals and downwards force due to the partial pressure of ion has the effect of enhancing the coronal abundance of high fip ions since they ionize higher up than the low fip elements .",
    "however quantitative considerations indicate that such fractionation only occurs for flow speeds in the coronal section of the loop much less than 1 km s@xmath78 ( in section 3.1 above we discussed flow speeds through the chromosphere ) .",
    "at a more realistic flow speed of 1 - 10 km s@xmath78 , all fractionation disappears .",
    "in this paper we have attempted to demonstrate that the ponderomotive force arising as alfvn waves propagate through the chromosphere of the sun or stars can give rise to the by now well documented coronal element abundance anomalies . the upward ponderomotive force on ions that produces",
    "the fip effect turns out to be relatively robust for solar parameters , and most likely diminishes as one moves either up or down in stellar activity from the sun .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the fractionation produced depends sensitively on the chromospheric wave energy density .",
    "there is nothing `` magic '' about the solar fip fractionation of a factor of 3 - 4 ; in the presence of higher or lower wave energy densities higher or lower fip fractionations will be seen . as well as providing a successful quantitative account of the solar fip effect and its variations",
    ", an inverse fip effect may also come out of the same model .",
    "the main simplifying assumptions we have employed in this work are that the magnetic field is constant with height in the chromospheric loop footpoints , the alfvn waves propagate only along the magnetic field ( but in both directions ) , and that the vertical structure of the chromosphere can be described by the models of @xcite with no fractionation in the absence of ponderomotive forces . using observed coronal spectra we have calculated the various element ionization fractions in the chromosphere , and using equation 14 we have evaluated the ponderomotive acceleration and resulting fip fractionation . once fully understood , coronal abundance anomalies may offer a unique diagnostic of alfvn wave propagation between the solar / stellar chromosphere and corona .    this work has been supported by nasa grant nag5 - 9105 , by nasa contract s13783 g , and by the nrl / onr solar magnetism and the earth s environment 6.1 research option .",
