    "the discovery of a new particle , which is consistent with the higgs boson within the current experimental uncertainties , by the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments at the lhc seems to complete the story of the standard model .",
    "the focus is now geared towards deciphering the next fundamental layer of physics , often referred to as `` new physics '' , as the standard model has several shortcomings .",
    "for instance , it does not have a suitable dark - matter candidate , nor can it fully account for the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in universe .    as a next - generation flavor experiment ,",
    "belleii  @xcite at the superkekb collider  @xcite is expected to play a pivotal role in the above pursuit . using a huge sample of @xmath2 collision data recorded at various @xmath3 resonances , about @xmath0 times that of its predecessor experiment ( belle  @xcite ) , it will indirectly probe new physics at an unprecedented level . measurements of charge - parity violation asymmetry in the decays of beauty and charm hadrons constitute a key experimental approach for belleii .",
    "the studies hinge on an accurate determination of decay - point positions of these hadrons as well as a precise measurement of low - momentum charged particles .",
    "these important tasks are accomplished by a sophisticated inner tracking device comprising two layers of pixelated silicon detector ( pxd ) and four layers of silicon vertex detector ( svd ) based on double - sided microstrip sensors .",
    "we report herein the design , prototyping and construction efforts of the belle - ii svd .",
    "details on the pxd can be found at ref .",
    "the pxd and svd are the two innermost subdetectors of the belleii experiment .",
    "they nicely complement each other in providing information of excellent spatial granularity and timing resolution .",
    "the resulting impact parameter resolution improves by a factor of two compared to belle , from 40 down to 20@xmath4 m  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the reconstruction efficiency of low - momentum particles and relatively long - lived particles such as @xmath5 mesons is improved , thanks to the extended outermost svd layer . the radii of the inner two pxd layers ( layer 1 and 2 ) are @xmath6 and @xmath7 mm , while the radii of the outer four svd layers ( layer 3 through 6 ) are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 mm . in comparison ,",
    "belle had the outermost svd layer at a radius of @xmath12 mm  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : layout ] shows a cut - off view of the svd . its l3 , l4 , l5 , and l6 ( l stands for layer ) are respectively composed of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath6 modules or ` ladders ' with a polar - angle coverage of @xmath16 . the asymmetry reflects the forward boost of the center - of - mass system arising due to a difference in energies ( @xmath17 on @xmath13gev ) of the colliding @xmath18 and @xmath19 beams .",
    "the l3 ladders are straight in shape , while those for l4 - 6 exhibit a slanted structure in the forward side .",
    "the corresponding slant angles are @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the idea behind this lantern - like layout is to reduce the material budget and number of readout channels without compromising the performance .",
    "clearly , these benefits come at the cost of a fairly complex mechanical structure .",
    "three types of double - sided silicon microstrip detectors ( dssds ) are used in the svd , all having the same length of 12.3 cm and thickness of 300 or 320@xmath4 m .",
    "the large rectangular dssds are @xmath23 cm wide and fully utilize the available space on a 6-inch wafer . a smaller width ( @xmath24 cm ) is chosen for l3 to ensure that the dssds are aranged in a circular fashion around the pxd .",
    "the width of the trapezoidal dssds in the forward part ranges between @xmath24 to @xmath23 cm .",
    "table  [ tab : sensor ] lists the specifications of various dssds used in the svd .",
    "the longer strips on the p - side are placed along the @xmath25 axis ( parallel to the beam direction ) and the shorter strips on the n - side are located on the transverse @xmath26-@xmath27 plane . the p - side of the l4 - 6 dssds faces the beam pipe , while the l3 dssds are oppositely arranged . both small and large rectangular dssds",
    "are fabricated by hamamatsu photonics in japan , and the trapezoidal ones by micron semiconductor in the uk .    to cope with the high particle rates expected at belleii , the dssds require fast readout electronics with a short integration ( shaping ) time .",
    "a pipeline is also necessary to allow a dead - time free data taking .",
    "furthermore , a radiation tolerance up to @xmath28kgy is desirable .",
    "the apv25 readout chip  @xcite , originally developed for cms , is found to satisfy all these requirements .",
    "it has a shaping time of @xmath0ns , compared to @xmath29ns of the va1ta chip used in belle , a pipeline depth of @xmath30 cells , and a nominal clock speed of @xmath31mhz .",
    "these chips are fabricated using a @xmath32 m cmos process and can withstand a radiation dose of over @xmath33mgy .    due to faster shaping of the apv25 chip compared to va1ta , a smaller input capacitance is required for the amplifier to retain signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this also means that concatenations of several dssds , as was done for belle , are simply prohibitive necessitating the need to place the readout asic as close to the dssd as possible .",
    "these conflicting requirements are met by the so - called `` origami '' chip - on - sensor design  @xcite .",
    "the full l3 ladder , and the forward and backward dssds in l4 - 6 adopt an edge - side readout scheme with fanouts , similar to belle . on the other hand , the central dssds ( one , two , and three for an l4 , l5 , and l6 ladder , respectively ) rely on the origami concept .",
    "this novel scheme helps minimize the distance between the dssd and the readout electronics , which in turn reduces the capacitive noise .",
    "the origami is a three - layer flexible fanout circuit ( flexpa ) made of polymide .",
    "it has ten apv25 chips for reading out the sensors .",
    "table  [ tab : ladder ] describes the number of ladders for each svd layer , the number of dssds and origamis per ladder , and the number of apv25 chips per dssd .",
    "we need three different kinds of origami flexpa designs depending on the svd layer : @xmath34 ( backward ) , ce ( central ) , and @xmath35 ( forward ) .",
    "all three of them are electrically equivalent differing only in the length of the tail part , or in the outer shape in case of origami @xmath35 , which is only used in l6 . between the flexpa and dssds , a @xmath33 mm thick sheet of light - weight styrofoam ( airex  @xcite )",
    "is inserted .",
    "this sheet provides both thermal and electrical insulation to minimize the heat transfer from the chips to the dssds and to avoid signal cross - talk .",
    "the apv25 chips are thinned down to 100@xmath4 m for the material budget reduction , and are glued to the origami flexpa by a thin layer of conductive adhesive .",
    "the n - side strips of a dssd are directly connected to the chips by wire - bonding and a small fanout circuit .",
    "those of the p - side are attached by two flexible fanout circuits , which are bent around the edge of the dssd and glued onto the origami flexpa in front of the apv25 chips .",
    "a gluing robot is used to dispense the glue , while an ultrasonic wedge bonder used for wire - bonding .",
    "figure  [ fig : origami ] shows the key feature of the origami concept .",
    "the ladder assembly procedure  @xcite is complicated and requires several kinds of jigs for each operation involved .",
    "the main purpose of these jigs is to ensure a precise alignment of the dssds during assembly .",
    "the total number of jigs required is different for each layer , being the maximum for l6 .    for the ladder assembly",
    ", we align the central dssd(s ) with the p - side at top , glue two fanout circuits on it , and perform wire - bonding between the readout and fanout circuit pads .",
    "we then flip the dssd and place it on the assembly bench . at this stage",
    ", we pickup the forward and backward subassemblies from the multipurpose chuck and place them on the assembly bench .",
    "we use a precision three - dimensional coordinate measuring machine ( cmm ) to align the sensors within a tolerance of 10@xmath4 m .",
    "each ladder is supported by two ribs made of carbon - fiber reinforced airex foam .",
    "the rib structure is very light but extremely stiff .",
    "we pick up the forward and backward subassemblies from the assembly bench , and glue them on the ribs .",
    "while assembling the central dssd we first glue the airex on the sensor , glue the origami module on the airex , and then perform wirebonding .",
    "the pick - up and placing of the sensors and flex circuits are accomplished via vacuum chucking . at the end",
    ", we place the plastic clips for holding the cooling pipe ( see below ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : assembly ] illustrates a part of the ladder assembly procedure .",
    "stage under the cmm.,title=\"fig : \" ]   stage under the cmm.,title=\"fig : \" ]   stage under the cmm.,title=\"fig : \" ]    on top of all apvs , we place a sheet of glass fiber and silicone rubber composite ( keratherm  @xcite ) that is electrically isolated but thermally conductive . the svd power dissipation per active area",
    "is estimated to be 60.7mw/@xmath36 .",
    "the apv25 chips are cooled down to @xmath37c with two - phase co@xmath1 flowing inside a thin @xmath38-mm diameter pipe that is placed on keratherm .",
    "this cooling has two major advantages : a ) it can withstand large amount of radiation and b ) it exhibits an excellent thermomechanical behavior . both the pxd and svd system share a common volume , filled with dry nitrogen gas to maintain a stable temperature and low dew point for avoiding condensation .",
    "the average material budget for one ladder including ribs , dssds , electronics and cooling is about @xmath39 of a radiation length .",
    "the construction workflow is split among several sites .",
    "the forward and backward subassemblies are produced at infn pisa and later shipped to other assembly sites : l4 ( tifr ) , l5 ( hephy ) , and l6 ( ipmu ) .",
    "the l3 assembly is performed by the melbourne group .",
    "the r&d for the ladder assembly procedure is now over , and each site has assembled a number of mechanical prototypes as well as one or two electrically working ladders .",
    "the latter have been tested with a @xmath40 @xmath41-ray source or laser to assess the overall performance and potential defects of the sensors .",
    "we present an l4 mechanical prototype in figure  [ fig : l4ladder ] .",
    "results of the source measurement performed on an electrically working l5 ladder are shown in figure  [ fig : eqa ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : electronics ] shows an overview of the whole svd readout system  @xcite .",
    "the analog signals from the apv25 chips are transmitted to flash analog - to - digital converter ( fadc ) boards via repeater boards .",
    "each fadc board can receive up to 48 apv25 analog outputs , and performs the analog to digital conversion for obtaining digitized signals .",
    "the digitized signals are decoded and further processed on an fpga , and propagated to a finesse transmitter board ( ftb ) .",
    "the ftb sends the data to the common pipelined platform for electronics readout ( copper ) , which is the belleii daq interface , through an optical cable using a unified high - speed serial protocol ( belle2link ) . in parallel",
    ", the ftb also transmits a replica output to the pxd data acquistion system using an aurora link .",
    "the copper board performs further data processing and sends the data for storage via the high - level trigger ( hlt ) system .",
    "a total of 48 fadc boards and 48 ftbs will be employed across belleii .",
    "all the components in the svd readout system are being developed while prototypes were successfully produced and tested .",
    "a test of the complete pxd+svd readout chain was performed  @xcite using the electron beam at desy .",
    "the beam energy was 2 to 6gev and 1 t of magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the beam line .",
    "the set - up included four svd test modules , with one large rectangular dssd in each , and one pxd module in a light - tight box , fadc and ftb boards , co@xmath1 cooling , slow control and environmental sensors based on optical fiber sensors .",
    "several aspects were checked .",
    "we find the svd cluster hit efficiency to be above @xmath42 for tracks within the fiducial volume .",
    "further , we confirm that the common mode correction and zero suppression schemes do not deteriorate the svd hit efficiency .",
    "in summary , the kekb machine and belle experiment are being upgraded to superkekb and belleii with a goal to indirectly probe new physics , in which the svd will play a key role .",
    "we have developed a robust assembly procedure for the svd ladder modules after extensive r&d .",
    "this includes the production of dedicated jigs , their fine - tuning and handling , glue spread control , and wire - bonding parameter tuning .",
    "the most innovative aspect among all has been the origami chip - on - sensor scheme that enables an excellent signal - to - noise ratio by reducing the capacitive noise .",
    "the assembly procedure is found to be reproducible allowing us to consistently assemble the ladders with an acceptable mechanical offset and good electrical quality .",
    "the full - scale production of svd ladders will start at the beginning of 2016 , which will be followed by commissioning in mid-2017 .",
    "the first physics run with both pxd and svd in will be towards the end of 2018 .",
    "we congratulate the organizers for a well organized conference and are grateful to colleagues those have helped us in preparing these proceedings .",
    "the research leading to these results has received funding from the european commission under the fp7 research infrastructures project aida , grant agreement no ."
