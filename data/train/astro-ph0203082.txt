    "most nearby galaxies contain massive dark objects at their centers ( e.g. kormendy & richstone 1995 , kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) , which are presumably black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "the existence of these objects was predicted by arguments based on quasi - stellar object ( qso ) energetics and demography ( e.g. sotan 1982 , rees 1984 ) .",
    "studies of central bhs in nearby galaxies have also revealed a tight correlation between bh mass and galactic velocity dispersion @xcite , and a less tight correlation between bh mass and the luminosity ( or mass ) of the hot stellar component of the host galaxy ( e.g. kormendy & gebhardt 2001 and references therein ; by `` hot''component we mean either an elliptical galaxy or the bulge of a spiral or s0 galaxy ) .",
    "these correlations strongly suggest a close link between the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central bhs .",
    "the simplest and most elegant argument relating the properties of qsos to bhs in nearby galaxies is due to @xcite , who pointed out that the luminosity function of qsos as a function of redshift traces the accretion history of these bhs .",
    "the bh mass density due to bright qso phases can be estimated directly from the local energy density in qso photons and an assumed mass - to - energy conversion efficiency ( sotan 1982 ; chokshi & turner 1992 ) .",
    "comparison of this density with the local bh mass density provides considerable insight into the formation and growth of massive bhs ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    in ",
    "[ sec : bhden ] , we provide new estimates of the local bh mass density and the bh mass density accreted during bright qso phases .",
    "there are several reasons why a re - analysis of this classic problem is timely .",
    "( i ) the past several years have seen dramatic improvements in optical qso surveys , both in terms of the total numbers of qsos and the parameter ranges ( i.e. , luminosities and redshifts ) over which the qso luminosity function is reliably determined .",
    "for example , the 2df qso redshift survey @xcite and the large bright qso survey @xcite have found @xmath8 qsos with absolute magnitude @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , at redshifts @xmath11 ; the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has found several hundred qsos with redshifts @xmath12 ( e.g. @xcite ; see also other surveys at high redshifts , e.g. schmidt , schneider & gunn 1995 etc . )",
    "( ii ) the sdss has provided a sample of @xmath13 nearby early - type galaxies ( elliptical galaxies and s0 galaxies ; bernardi et al .",
    "2001 ) with accurate luminosities and velocity dispersions . using the tight correlation between bh mass and galactic velocity dispersion",
    ", we can estimate the bh masses in these galaxies and thereby obtain the mass function of bhs at @xmath14 .",
    "( iii ) a large number of obscured active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( e.g. @xmath15410 times the number of unobscured agns ) is required to explain the observed x - ray background spectrum ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the bh mass density inferred from the x - ray background by @xcite is larger than the one derived from optically bright qsos by @xcite by a factor of 34 .",
    "bhs in local galaxies are the remnants of both obscured and unobscured agns .",
    "thus , an accurate estimate of the local bh mass density and the accreted mass density from optically bright qsos can also constrain the fraction of obscured agns for comparison to models of the x - ray background .    if bh growth occurs mainly during optically bright qso phases , then not only should the bh mass density in local galaxies be consistent with the total energy density in qso light , but also the bh mass distribution in local galaxies should be consistent with the qso luminosity function ( e.g. @xcite ) . in ",
    "[ sec : clue ] , by studying the continuity equation for the bh mass distribution , we test this hypothesis and give more general observational constraints ( e.g. on the mass - to - energy conversion efficiency and lifetime of qsos ) on the growth of massive bhs in galactic nuclei .",
    "the effects of bh mergers ( caused by galaxy mergers ) on the bh mass distribution are also considered . since the physics of bh mergers is poorly understood , we consider two extreme cases : one is the classical case ( mergers do not emit gravitational radiation and the total bh mass is conserved during bh mergers ) , which is implicitly assumed in sotan s argument ; the other is the adiabatic case ( total bh area and entropy is conserved during bh mergers and mass is radiated away as gravitational radiation ; see also @xcite ) .",

    "this result differs by only 20% from the estimate of bernardi et al . , which uses several parameters including the concentration index to separate early- from late - type galaxies .",

    "was derived by magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but with normalization larger by a factor of 34 , presumably because of the limitations of ground - based spectroscopy and isotropic dynamical models .",
    "most of the galaxies in @xcite and @xcite have distances derived from tonry et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which implies a hubble constant @xmath69 @xcite , and the normalizations in equations ( [ eq : msigma ] ) and ( [ eq : mlb ] ) have been adjusted to our assumed hubble constant @xmath70 .",
    "because the mass  dispersion relation is the tighter of the two relations , we will first use equation ( [ eq : msigma ] ) to estimate the local bh mass density .",
    "thus , with the distribution of velocity dispersion @xmath71 determined by @xcite , we have the local bh mass density in early - type galaxies : @xmath72 where @xmath32 has been equated to @xmath64 and @xmath73 is obtained from equation ( [ eq : msigma ] ) .",
    "the error estimate represents only the effects of the uncertainties in equations ( [ eq : numden ] ) and ( [ eq : msigma ] ) .",
    "we may also use the mass  luminosity relation ( [ eq : mlb ] ) to estimate @xmath74 .",
    "we note first that the luminosity provided in @xcite is the total luminosity .",
    "early - type galaxies include both elliptical galaxies and s0 galaxies . for s0 galaxies ,",
    "the bulge and disk both contribute to the total luminosity .",
    "therefore , when applying equation ( [ eq : mlb ] ) , we need to correct the total luminosity of an s0 galaxy to its bulge luminosity . since the bh mass is approximately proportional to the luminosity of the hot stellar component ( i.e. , @xmath66 in eq .  [ eq : mlb ] is approximately 1 ) , we may simply correct the total luminosity density of early - type galaxies in @xcite by the ratio of the luminosity density of hot components to the total luminosity density .",
    "@xcite estimated the relative luminosity densities @xmath75 ( in the @xmath47 band ) for elliptical galaxies , s0 galaxies , spiral and irregular galaxies , and hot components .",
    "they found @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "they also estimate that in s0 galaxies , the bulge luminosity is a fraction @xmath78 of the total luminosity .",
    "thus , the total luminosity in hot components of early - type galaxies occupies a fraction 0.76 [ eq : lfrac ] of the total luminosity in early - type galaxies . the local bh mass density in early - type galaxies is therefore given by : @xmath79 where the color transformation between @xmath38 and @xmath47 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : bgtrans ] ) has been used .",
    "massive bhs exist not only in early - type galaxies but also in spiral bulges .",
    "hence , we must augment the estimates ( [ eq : rhoearlysigma ] ) and ( [ eq : rhoearlyl ] ) by the contribution from bhs in spiral bulges . as above , we assume that the luminosity fraction is approximately equal to the bh mass fraction , and thus the total bh mass density is @xmath80 times the bh mass density in early - type galaxies , i.e. , from equation ( [ eq : rhoearlysigma ] ) ( z=0)1.44=(2.30.3)10 ^ 5 ^-3 , [ eq : rhosigmaa ] and from equation ( [ eq : rhoearlyl ] ) ( z=0)1.442.910 ^ 5 ^ -3 .",
    "[ eq : rhola ]    one additional correction to these estimates must be considered . in deriving equations ( [ eq : rhoearlysigma ] ) and ( [ eq : rhoearlyl ] ) ,",
    "we have ignored any intrinsic dispersion in the mass  dispersion relation and the mass  luminosity relations ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : msigma ] and [ eq : mlb ] ) .",
    "note that equations ( [ eq : msigma ] ) and ( [ eq : mlb ] ) are fitted in the @xmath81@xmath82 and @xmath83@xmath84 spaces .",
    "let us assume that the distribution in @xmath83 at a given value of @xmath32 or @xmath85 is gaussian , with mean given by the relations ( [ eq : msigma ] ) or ( [ eq : mlb ] ) , and standard deviation @xmath86 that is independent of @xmath32 or @xmath85 .",
    "then our estimates of the mass density must be increased by a factor = 1 + 12 ( 10)^2 ^ 2_m+(^4_m ) . the intrinsic scatter @xmath86 in the mass - dispersion relation is small enough that it is difficult to distinguish from measurement errors , but is less than @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding correction factor is therefore between 1 and 1.2 , and we shall adopt 1.1 .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion in the mass  luminosity relation is @xmath88 ( note that only the intrinsic dispersion , not measurement error , is included in the definition of @xmath86 ) , so the corresponding correction is a factor of 2.0 .",
    "thus the density estimates ( [ eq : rhosigmaa ] ) and ( [ eq : rhola ] ) become ( z=0)=(2.50.4)10 ^ 5 ^ -3 , [ eq : rhosigma ] and ( z=0)=5.810 ^ 5 ^ -3 .",
    "[ eq : rhol ] the error estimate in equation ( [ eq : rhosigma ] ) represents the combination of the @xmath1510% uncertainty in the correction factor 1.1 due to intrinsic scatter , and the error estimate in equation ( [ eq : rhosigmaa ] ) .",
    "the error in equation ( [ eq : rhol ] ) is difficult to estimate but is certainly much larger than the error in equation ( [ eq : rhosigma ] ) .",
    "earlier estimates include @xmath89 @xcite , @xmath90 @xcite , and @xmath91 @xcite .    the estimates ( [ eq : rhosigma ] ) and ( [ eq : rhol ] ) differ by a factor of more than two .",
    "we believe that equation ( [ eq : rhosigma ] ) is substantially more reliable than equation ( [ eq : rhol ] ) , since the correlation between @xmath63 and @xmath32 is tighter and the result does not depend on the uncertain bulge - disk decomposition . nevertheless , the discrepancy between the two equations is worth investigating .",
    "the problem can not arise from different estimates of the local galaxy density , since both results employ the same galaxy sample @xcite ; nor can it plausibly arise from errors in the bh mass determinations , since the mass - dispersion and mass - luminosity relation are based on the same set of mass estimates ( see tremaine et al . 2002 and kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ,",
    "respectively ) . to isolate the problem",
    ", it is useful to examine the faber - jackson relation between dispersion and luminosity .",
    "the mean relation derived from a large sample of early - type galaxies @xcite by @xcite is ( /)=2.25 - 0.102(m_b+20 ) , [ eq : prug ] while the mean relation derived from the @xcite sample is ( /)=2.18 - 0.100(m_b+20 )",
    ". thus the mean absolute magnitude at a given dispersion in the @xcite sample is displaced by @xmath92 from equation ( [ eq : prug ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean residual in absolute magnitude from the relation ( [ eq : prug ] ) for the 31 early - type galaxies with bh mass determinations in @xcite is @xmath93 .",
    "a component of the latter difference arises because equation ( [ eq : prug ] ) includes both bulge and disk luminosity in s0 galaxies , while the luminosities quoted in @xcite refer only to the bulges in s0 galaxies .",
    "correcting crudely for this using equation ( [ eq : lfrac ] ) reduces @xmath94 to + 0.24 .",
    "together , @xmath95 and @xmath94 imply that the mean absolute magnitude at a given dispersion is about 1 magnitude brighter in the @xmath18 sdss galaxies used to determine the velocity - dispersion and luminosity distribution of nearby galaxies than in the @xmath96 galaxies used to determine the mass - luminosity and mass - dispersion relation for bhs .",
    "this difference is sufficient to explain the difference in bh density estimates in equations ( [ eq : rhosigma ] ) and ( [ eq : rhol ] ) .",
    "what is less clear is the origin of this difference .",
    "possible explanations include selection effects in either the @xcite sample or the sample of galaxies with bh masses , or systematic differences in the magnitude or dispersion measurements between sdss and pointed galaxy surveys .",

    "2001 ) . in our calculation",
    "we have extrapolated bernardi et al.s distribution of magnitude ( or velocity dispersion ) to arbitrarily faint galaxies .",
    "this uncertain extrapolation should not significantly affect our estimate of bh mass density , as seen from the following arguments .",
    "( i ) if we assume that the distribution of absolute magnitude obtained in the sdss is constant for all magnitudes fainter than @xmath98 ( rather than obeying a gaussian distribution in @xmath99 ) , the total luminosity density is increased by less than 15% .",
