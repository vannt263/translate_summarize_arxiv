    "the wind in zones [ 2 , 1 ] , [ 2 , 2 ] , and [ 2 , 3 ] are located above the accretion disk ( figure  [ fig : cydiskmodelzone ] , _ right _ ) .",
    "since the initial positions of the streamlines , @xmath42 , are contained within zone [ 2 , 0 ] , the rotational velocity in these outer zones rapidly diverges from keplerian motion and quickly becomes smaller with larger @xmath30 , in accordance with the conservation of angular momentum ( see equation  [ eqn : rotvelocity ] ) .",

    "the median black hole mass recovered using the model was @xmath98 , approximately four times larger than the input black hole mass , and for the model , the median recovered black hole mass is double the input mass with @xmath99 .",

    "the median black hole mass recovered for the model of @xmath100 is slightly overestimated , while the mass is underestimated in the model with @xmath101 .",
    "obtaining accurate black hole mass measurements is crucial for understanding the role of black hole growth in galaxy evolution .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand how the geometry and inclination of the blr , and the chosen line width measurement affect the accuracy in our mass estimation .    the range of @xmath0 values can be much greater than the prescribed spread in the literature value .",
    "therefore , we need to be cautious when using a single value of @xmath0 as it may bias mass estimates especially when the inclination angle is low . the and models establish relationships between the @xmath0 factor and inclination angle ( figure  [ fig : logfvsiz22_me ] , _ upper _ ) , in agreement with @xcite despite different modelling approach .",

    "however , the @xcite predictions for a geometrically thin disk model better matches our findings for @xmath93 .    the line widths are typically measured using the fwhm or @xmath13 . as the fwhm is a zeroth moment of the line profile , the sensitivity to the line core is higher than it is in the line wings .",
    "in contrast , @xmath13 is a second moment of the line and is less affected by the line core .",

    "it is worth mentioning several caveats in our modelling approach .",
    "the disk wind model simulations presented are simplifications of the complex blr .",
