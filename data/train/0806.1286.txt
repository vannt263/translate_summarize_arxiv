    "cahn - hilliard equation describes the process of phase separation , by which the two components of a binary fluid spontaneously separate and form domains pure in each component .",
    "the main objective of this article is to provide a theoretical approach to dynamic phase transitions for binary systems .",
    "classically , phase transitions are classified by the ehrenfest classification scheme , based on the lowest derivative of the free energy that is discontinuous at the transition . in general , it is a difficult task to classify phase transitions of higher order , which appears in many equilibrium phase transition systems , such as the pvt system , the ferromagnetic system , superfluids as well as the binary systems studied in this article .    for this purpose ,",
    "a new dynamic transition theory is developed recently by the authors .",
    "this new theory provides an efficient tool to analyze phase transitions of higher order . with this theory in our disposal ,",
    "a new dynamic classification scheme is obtained , and classifies phase transitions into three categories : type - i , type - ii and type - iii , corresponding mathematically to continuous , jump , and mixed transitions , respectively ; see the appendix as well as two recent books by the authors @xcite for details .",
    "there have been extensive studies in the past on the dynamics of the cahn - hilliard equations .",
    "however , very little is known about the higher order transitions encountered for this problem , and this article gives a complete classification of the dynamics transitions for binary systems .",
    "the results obtained lead in particular to various physical predictions .",
    "first , the order of phase transitions is precisely determined by the sign of a nondimensional parameter @xmath0 such that if @xmath1 , the transition is first - order with latent heat and if @xmath2 , the transition is second - order .",
    "second , a theoretical transition diagram is derived , leading in particular to a prediction that there is only second - order transition for molar fraction near @xmath3 .",
    "this is different from the prediction made by the classical transition diagram .",
    "third , a critical length scale is derived such that no phase separation occurs at any temperature if the length of the container is smaller than the critical length scale .",
    "these physical predictions will be addressed in another article .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2 , both the classical cahn - hilliard equation and the cahn - hilliard equation coupled with entropy are introduced in a unified fashion using a general principle for equilibrium phase transitions outlined in appendix b. sections 3 - 6 analyze dynamic transitions for the cahn - hilliard equation in general domain , rectangular domain , with periodic boundary conditions , and for the cahn - hilliard equation coupled with entropy .",
    "physical conclusions are given in section 7 , and the dynamic transition theory is recalled in appendix a.",
    "materials compounded by two components @xmath4 and @xmath5 , such as binary alloys , binary solutions and polymers , are called binary systems .",
    "sufficient cooling of a binary system may lead to phase separations , i.e. , at the critical temperature , the concentrations of both components @xmath4 and @xmath5 with homogeneous distribution undergo changes , leading to heterogeneous distributions in space .",
    "phase separation of binary systems observed will be in one of two main ways .",
    "the first is by nucleation in which sufficiently large nuclei of the second phase appear randomly and grow , and this corresponds to type - ii phase transitions .",
    "the second is by spinodal decomposition in which the systems appear to nuclear at once , and periodic or semi - periodic structure is seen , and this corresponds to type - i phase transitions .",
    "since binary systems are conserved , the equations describing the helmholtz process and the gibbs process are the same .",
    "hence , without distinction we use the term `` free energy '' to discuss this problem .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 be the concentrations of components @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , then @xmath8 . in a homogeneous state , @xmath9 is a constant , and the entropy density @xmath10 is also a constant .",

    "we first briefly recall the classical thermodynamic theory for a binary system .",

    "when consider the concentration @xmath415 as homogeneous in @xmath288 , then by ( [ 8.122 ] ) the dynamic equation of a binary system is an ordinary differential equation : @xmath416    let @xmath417 @xmath418 be the steady state solution of ( [ 8.124 ] ) .",
    "then , by the taylor expansion at @xmath419 , omitting the @xmath119th order terms with @xmath420 , ( [ 8.124 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath421 where @xmath422 it is easy to see that @xmath423    it is clear that the critical parameter curve @xmath424 in the @xmath425 plane is given by @xmath426 which is schematically illustrated in the classical phase diagram ; see the dotted line in figure  [ f8.14 ] .",

    "in the following we shall discuss the spinodal decomposition in a unified fashion by applying the phase transition theorems presented in the previous sections .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "phase separation processes of binary systems occur in two ways , one of which proceeds continuously depending on @xmath104 , and the other one does not .",
    "obviously , the classical theory does not explain these phenomena .",
    "in fact , the first one can be described by the type - i phase transition , and the second one can be explained by the type - ii and type - iii phase transitions .",
    "we first consider the case where the container @xmath435 with @xmath436 is a rectangular domain .",

    "the phase diagram for type - ii transition is given by figure [ f8.16 ] .",
    "in figure [ f8.16 ] , @xmath386 is the critical temperature as in ( [ 8.117 ] ) , @xmath441 is defined by ( [ 8.126 - 1 ] ) and is the saddle - node bifurcation point of ( [ 8.125 ] ) .",

    "the type - i phase transition occurs at @xmath394 and type - ii does in @xmath447 .",
    "furthermore , latent heat is accompanied the type - ii phase transition . actually , when a binary system undergoes a transition from @xmath417 to @xmath450 @xmath451 , there is a gap @xmath452 for any @xmath447 . by the first equation in ( [ 8.113 ] ) it yields a jump of entropy between @xmath417 and @xmath450 : @xmath453 where @xmath454 represents the entropy density deviation .",

    "in addition , @xmath732 satisfy @xmath733 where @xmath734 is the chemical potential of component @xmath735 , @xmath736 and @xmath737 is a function depending on the other components @xmath449 @xmath738 . when @xmath114 , i.e. , the system consists of two components @xmath4 and @xmath5 , this term @xmath739 .",
    "thus , from ( [ 7.33])-([7.35 ] ) we obtain the dynamical equations as follows @xmath740,\\\\ & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n}|_{\\partial\\omega}=0,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\frac{\\partial\\delta u}{\\partial n}|_{\\partial\\omega}=0,\\\\ & u(x,0)=\\varphi ( x ) , \\end{aligned } \\right.\\label{7.36}\\ ] ] for @xmath741 , where @xmath742 are constants , @xmath743 satisfy @xmath744    if the order parameters @xmath745 are coupled to the conserved variables @xmath746 , then the dynamical equations are @xmath747,\\\\ & \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial n}|_{\\partial\\omega}=0\\ \\ \\ \\ ( \\text{or}\\ u_i|_{\\partial\\omega}=0),\\\\ & \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial n}|_{\\partial\\omega}=0,\\ \\ \\ \\",

    "the model ( [ 7.38 ] ) gives a general form of the governing equations to thermodynamic phase transitions .",
    "hence , the dynamics of equilibrium phase transition in statistic physics is based on the new ginzburg - landau formulation ( [ 7.38 ] ) .",
    "physically , the initial value condition @xmath750 in ( [ 7.38 ] ) stands for the fluctuation of system or perturbation from the external .",
    "hence , @xmath751 is generally small .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility of a bigger noise @xmath751 ."
