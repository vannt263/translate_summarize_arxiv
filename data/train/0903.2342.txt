    "background estimation is an omnipresent problem for source detection methods in astrophysics , especially when the source signal is weak and difficult to discriminate against the background .",
    "an inaccurate estimation of the background may produce large errors in object photometry and the loss of faint and/or extended objects .",
    "deep observations are commonly obtained by combining several individual exposures to generate a final astronomical image .",
    "often large exposure variations characterize these data and the background may vary significantly within the field . hence , the background modelling has to incorporate the knowledge provided by the observatory s exposure time without compromising the statistical properties .",
    "in addition , instrumental structures , such as detector ribs or ccd gaps , produce lack of data .",
    "the missing data must be handled consistently in the background estimation to prevent undesired artificial effects .",
    "+ celestial objects exhibit a large variety of morphologies and apparent sizes .",
    "thus , the search for sources should not be driven by any predefined morphology , allowing proper estimate of their structural parameters .",
    "the instrumental point spread function ( psf ) is often not known exactly for the whole field of view .",
    "so a source detection algorithm should be able to operate effectively without the knowledge of the instrument characteristics .",
    "conventional source detection methods employed in deep imaging surveys are : sextractor ( @xcite ) , sliding window technique ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and maximum likelihood psf fitting ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , wavelet transformation ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a review of these techniques can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "sextractor is one of the most widely used source detection procedure in astronomy .",
    "it has a simple interface and very fast execution .",
    "it produces reliable aperture photometry catalogues ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is applied in _",
    "x_ray regime on filtered images ( valtchanov et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the sliding window technique is a fast and robust source detection method .",
    "this technique may fail while detecting extended sources , sources near the detection limit and nearby sources ( valtchanov et al .",
    "this source detection method has been refined with more elaborated techniques , such as matched filters ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) and recently the cash method ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cash method is a maximum likelihood technique .",
    "for source detection , the method employs a cash likelihood  ratio statistic , that is an extended @xmath0 statistic for poisson data ( @xcite ) .",
    "both the matched filters and cash methods are at least by a factor of @xmath1 more sensitive than the sliding  window technique ( @xcite ) .",
    "though , both methods are designed for the detection of point sources .",
    "the candidate sources are characterized in a further step using maximum likelihood psf fitting .",
    "the maximum likelihood psf fitting procedure performs better than other conventional techniques for flux measurements of point  like sources although accurate photometry is achieved when the psf model used is close to the image psf ( valtchanov et al .",
    "2001 ) . in @xcite , the maximum likelihood profile fit on photon images is extended taking into account a spherically symmetric @xmath2model ( king profile , see refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) convolved with the instrumental psf for improving the photometry of extended objects .",
    "wavelet transform ( wt ) techniques improve the detection of faint and extended sources with respect to other conventional methods ( see @xcite for more details ) . in fact , wt techniques are able to discriminate structures as a function of scale . within larger scales ,",
    "faint and extended sources are revealed .",
    "wts are therefore valuable tools for the detection of both point  like and extended sources ( valtchanov et al",
    ".  2001 ) .",
    "nonetheless , these techniques favor the detection of circularly symmetric sources ( valtchanov et al .",
    "in addition , artefacts may appear around the detected structures in the reconstructed image , and the flux is not preserved ( @xcite ) . in order to overcome these problems ,",
    "some refinements have been applied to the wt techniques .",
    "@xcite , for instance , employ a multi  resolution support filtering to preserve the flux and the adjoint wt operator to suppress artefacts which may appear around the objects .",
    "an advance on this method is presented in @xcite .",
    "a space  variant psf is incorporated in their wt technique .",
    "object by object reconstruction is performed . for point sources the flux measurements are close to that obtained by psf fitting .",
    "the detection of faint extended and point  like sources is a non ",
    "trivial task for source detection methods .",
    "this task becomes more complicated when the detection rate and photometric reconstruction for the sources are taken into account ( valtchanov et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "a self  consistent statistical approach for background estimation and source detection is given by bayesian probability theory ( bpt ) , which provides a general and consistent frame for logical inference .",
    "the achievement of bayesian techniques on signal detections in astrophysics has already been shown , for example in the works of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , for instance . in modern observational astrophysics , bpt techniques for image analysis",
    "have been extensively applied : e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for the detection of discrete objects embedded in gaussian noise ( microwave regime )",
    ", @xcite utilizes a model  fitting methodology , where a parameterized form for the objects of interest is assumed .",
    "chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) techniques are used to explore the parameter space . an advance on this work",
    "is provided by carvalho et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . for speeding up the method of @xcite , carvalho et al .",
    "( 2008 ) proposes to use gaussian approximation to the posterior probability density function ( pdf ) peak when performing a bayesian model selection for source detection .",
    "the work of @xcite is developed within gaussian statistics ( infrared data ) . at each pixel position in an image , their method estimates the probability of the data being described by point source or empty sky under the assumptions that the background is uniform and the sources have circular shapes .",
    "the bayesian information criterion is used for the selection of the two models .",
    "source parameters are estimated in a second step employing bayesian model selection .",
    "@xcite developed a technique for image analysis within poisson statistics .",
    "the technique is instrument specific and is applied to @xmath3ray data .",
    "the first objective of this technique is to reconstruct the intensity in each image pixel given a set of data .",
    "the maximum entropy method is used for selecting from the data an image between all the available ones from a multi  dimensional space .",
    "the dimension of the space is proportional to the number of image pixels .",
    "we propose a new source detection method based on bpt combined with the mixture  model technique .",
    "the algorithm allows one to estimate the background and its uncertainties and to detect celestial sources jointly .",
    "the new approach deals directly with the statistical nature of the data .",
    "each pixel in an astronomical image is probabilistically assessed to contain background only or with additional source signal .",
    "the results are given by probability distributions quantifying our state of knowledge .",
    "the developed background  source separation ( bss ) method encounters : background estimation , source detection and characterization .",
    "+ the background estimation incorporates the knowledge of the exposure time map .",
    "the estimation of the background and its uncertainties is performed on the full astronomical image employing a two  dimensional spline .",
    "the spline models the background rate .",
    "the spline amplitudes and the position of the spline supporting points provides flexibility in the background model .",
    "this procedure can describe both smoothly and highly varying backgrounds .",
    "hence , no cut out of regions or employment of meshes are needed for the background estimation .",
    "the bss technique does not need a threshold level for separating the sources from the background as conventional methods do .",
    "the threshold level is replaced by a measure of probability . in conventional methods ,",
    "the threshold level is described in terms of the noise standard deviation , then translated into a probability .",
    "the classification assigned to each pixel of an astronomical image with the bss method allows one to detect sources without employing any predefined morphologies .",
    "only , for parametric characterization of the sources predefined source shapes are applied .",
    "the estimation of source parameters and their uncertainties includes the estimated background into a forward model .",
    "only the statistics of the original data are taken into account .",
    "the bss method provides simultaneously the advantages of a multi  resolution analysis and a multi  color detection .",
    "objects in astronomical images are organized in hierarchical structures @xcite . in order to quantify the multiscale structure in the data ,",
    "a multi  resolution analysis is required ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the bss approach the multi ",
    "resolution analysis is incorporated in combination with the source detection and background estimation technique with the aim to analyse statistically source structures at multiple scales . when multiband images are available , the information contained in each image",
    "can be statistically combined in order to extend the detection limit of the data ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "+ the capabilities of this method are best shown with the detections of faint sources independently of their shape and with the detections of sources embedded in a highly varying background .",
    "the technique for the joint estimation of background and sources in digital images is applicable to digital images collected by a wide variety of sensors at any wavelength .",
    "x_ray environment is particularly suitable to our bayesian approach for different reasons .",
    "x_ray astronomy is characterized by low photon counts even for relatively large exposures and the observational data are unique , i.e.  the experiment is rarely reproduced .",
    "second , the _ x_ray astronomical images provided by new generation instruments are usually a combination of several individual ccd imaging pointings .",
    "last , there are few source detection algorithms developed so far for an automated search of faint and extended sources .    in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to describe the developed bss technique .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ bi ] ,",
    "we briefly review the basic aspects of bpt . in section [ technique",
    "] , we introduce the background estimation and source detection technique . in section [ eosp ] ,",
    "the bss algorithm is extended in order to obtain an automated algorithm for source characterization . in section [ rely ] , the issue of false positives in source detection is addressed . in section [ simu_data ] ,",
    "the bss method is applied to simulated data .",
    "we show results for two different choices of prior pdf for the source signal . in section [ compa ] ,",
    "our results on the three simulated datasets are compared with the outcome from wavdetect algorithm ( @xcite ) . in section [ odata ] , we test the bss method on astronomical images coming from _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) data . our conclusions on the bss technique are provided in section [ conclu ] . in section [ acro ] , a list of acronyms used throughout the paper is reported .",
    "the flexibility of our bayesian technique allows the investigation of data coming from past and modern instruments without changes in our algorithm .",
    "an extensive application of the bss technique to real data is addressed in a forthcoming paper ( guglielmetti et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in the latter , the bss algorithm is used for the analysis of a specific scientific problem , i.e.  the search of galaxy clusters in the cdf  s data .",
    "in order to analyse the heterogeneous data present in astronomical images , we employ bpt ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "bpt gives a calculus how to resolve an inference problem based on uncertain information .",
    "the outcome of the bpt analysis is the pdf of the quantity of interest , which encodes the knowledge to be drawn from the information available ( _ a posteriori _ ) .",
    "the posterior pdf comprises the complete information which can be inferred from the data and the statistical model , and supplementary information such as first  principle physics knowledge .",
    "this statistical approach is based on comparisons among alternative hypotheses ( or models ) using the single observed data set .",
    "each information entering the models that describe the data set is combined systematically .",
    "the combination includes all data sets coming from different diagnostics , physical model parameters and measurement nuisance parameters .",
    "each data set and parameters entering the models are subject to uncertainties which have to be estimated and encoded in probability distributions . within bpt",
    "the so  called statistical and systematic uncertainties are not distinguished .",
    "both kinds of uncertainties are treated as a lack of knowledge .",
    "bayes theorem states : @xmath4 where the number of alternative hypotheses to be compared is larger than or equal to @xmath5 .",
    "bayes theorem is a consequence of the sum and product rules of probability theory .",
    "the vertical bars in ( [ bt ] ) denote conditionality property , based on either empirical or theoretical information .",
    "equation ( [ bt ] ) relates the _ posterior _ pdf @xmath6 to known quantities , namely , the _ likelihood _ pdf @xmath7 and the _ prior _ pdf @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the _ evidence _ of the data which constitutes the normalization and will not affect the conclusions within the context of a given model .",
    "the posterior pdf is the quantity to be inferred .",
    "it depends on the full data set @xmath10 , on the errors @xmath11 entering the experiment and on all relevant information concerning the nature of the physical situation and knowledge of the experiment ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the likelihood pdf represents the probability of finding the data @xmath10 for given quantities of interest , uncertainties @xmath11 and additional information @xmath12 .",
    "it reveals the error statistics of the experiment .",
    "the prior pdf is independent from the experimental errors .",
    "it represents physical constraints or additional information from other diagnostics . the terms ` posterior ' and ` prior ' have a logical rather than temporal meaning .",
    "the posterior and prior pdfs can be regarded as the knowledge ` with ' and ` without ' the new data taken into account , respectively .    in order to arrive at the pdf of any quantity @xmath13 in the model , marginalization of the multi  dimensional pdf",
    "can be regarded as a projection of the complete pdf on to that quantity .",
    "marginalization is performed by integration over the quantity @xmath14 one wants to get rid of : @xmath15 marginalization of a quantity @xmath14 thus takes into account the uncertainty of @xmath14 which is quantified by the pdf p(y ) .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath14 propagates into the pdf p(x ) .",
    "marginalization provides a way to eliminate variables which are necessary to formulate the likelihood but otherwise uninteresting .",
    "another important property of bpt is the capability of modelling the data by mixture distributions in the parameter space ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "mixture distributions are an appropriate tool for modelling processes whose output is thought to be generated by several different underlying mechanisms , or to come from several different populations .",
    "our aim is to identify and characterize these underlying ` latent classes ' .",
    "therefore , we follow the standard bayesian approach to this problem , which is to define a prior distribution over the parameter space of the mixture model and combine this with the observed data to give a posterior distribution over the parameter space . essential for model comparison or object classification",
    "is the marginal likelihood ( _ evidence _ , _ prior predicted value _ ) .",
    "marginalization ( integration ) of the likelihood over parameter space provides a measure for the credibility of a model for given data",
    ". ratios of marginal likelihoods ( _ bayes factors _ ) are frequently used for comparing two models @xcite .",
    "details of mixture modelling in the framework of bpt can be found in von der linden et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) and fischer et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 , 2002 ) . in particular , @xcite have demonstrated the capability of the bayesian mixture model technique even with an unknown number of components for background separation from a measured spectrum .",
    "the present approach follows these previous works .",
    "the aim of the bss method is the joint estimation of background and sources in two  dimensional image data .",
    "we can identify two basic steps of our algorithm : ( a ) background estimation and source detection , ( b ) calculation of source probability maps in a multi  resolution analysis .",
    "the input information of the developed algorithm is the experimental data , i.e.  the detected photon counts , and the observatory s exposure time .",
    "the background rate is assumed to be smooth , e.g.  spatially slowly varying compared to source dimensions . to allow for smoothness the background rate is modelled with a two  dimensional thin ",
    "plate spline ( tps ) , ( section [ tps_label ] ) .",
    "the number and the positions of the pivots , i.e.  the spline s supporting points , decide what data structures are assigned to be background .",
    "all structures which can not be described by the background model will be assigned to be sources . the number of pivots required to model the background depends on the characteristics of the background itself . though the minimum number of pivots is four ( since the minimum expansion of the selected spline has four terms ) , their number increases with increasing background variation .    the coexistence of background and sources is described with a probabilistic two  component mixture model ( section [ tcmm ] ) where one component describes background contribution only and the other component describes background plus source contributions .",
    "each pixel is characterized by the probability of belonging to one of the two mixture components . for the background estimation the photons contained in all pixels",
    "are considered including those containing additional source contributions .",
    "no data censoring by cutting out source areas is employed .    for background estimation the source intensity",
    "is considered to be a nuisance parameter . according to the rules of bpt ,",
    "the source signal distribution is described probabilistically in terms of a prior pdf .",
    "the prior pdf of the source signal is an approximation to the true distribution of the source signal on the field .",
    "we studied two prior pdfs of the source signal : the exponential and the inverse  gamma function .",
    "the background and its uncertainties ( section [ sec : errbkg ] ) are estimated from its posterior pdf .",
    "therefore , for each pixel of an astronomical image an estimate of its background and its uncertainties are provided",
    ".    moreover , the bayesian approach introduces hyper  parameters , that are fundamental for the estimation of the posterior pdfs for the background and source intensities .",
    "specifically , in section [ hyperpar ] we show that the hyper ",
    "parameters are estimated exclusively from the data .",
    "the source probability is evaluated with the mixture model technique for pixels and pixel cells ] in order to enhance the detection of faint and extended sources in a multi  resolution analysis .",
    "pixels and pixel cells are treated identically within the bayesian formalism .",
    "for the correlation of neighbouring pixels , the following methods have been investigated : box filter with a square , box filter with a circle , gaussian weighting filter ( see section [ tcmm ] for more details ) .",
    "the bss technique is morphology free , i.e.  there are no restrictions on the object size and shape for being detected .",
    "an analysed digital astronomical image is converted into the following :    * the background rate image , or _ ` tps map ' _ , is an array specifying the estimated background rate at each image pixel for a given observation .",
    "the effects of exposure variations are consistently included in the spline model ; * the background image , or _ ` background map ' _ , is an array specifying the estimated background amplitude at each image pixel for a given observation .",
    "it is provided by the tps map multiplied with the telescope s exposure ; * the source probability images , or _",
    "` source probability maps ' ( spms ) _ , display the probability that source counts are present in pixels and pixel cells for a given observation in a multi  resolution analysis .",
    "movies are produced with the spms obtained at different resolutions .",
    "the moving images allow one to discern interactively the presence of faint extended sources in digital astronomical images .",
    "the size of faint extended sources is correlated with the scale of the resolution , used for their detection .",
    "spms coming from other energy bands can be combined statistically to produce conclusive spms at different resolutions with the advantage to provide likelihoods for the detected sources from the combined energy bands ( section [ comb ] ) .",
    "the general idea of the described bayesian model is that a digital astronomical image consists of a smooth background with additive source signal , which can be characterized by any shape , size and brightness .",
    "the background signal is the diffuse cosmic emission added to the instrumental noise .",
    "the source signal is the response of the imaging system to a celestial object .",
    "a surface @xmath16 describes the background under the source signal , where @xmath17 corresponds to the position on the grid in the image .",
    "+ therefore , given the observed data set @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is photon counts in pixel ( or pixel cell ) @xmath20 , two complementary hypotheses arise : @xmath21 hypothesis @xmath22 specifies that the data @xmath19 consists only of background counts @xmath23 spoiled with noise @xmath24 , i.e.  the ( statistical ) uncertainty associated with the measurement process .",
    "hypothesis @xmath25 specifies the case where additional source intensity @xmath26 contributes to the background .",
    "additional assumptions are that no negative values for source and background amplitudes are allowed and that the background is smoother than the source signal . + the smoothness of the background is achieved by modelling the background count rate with a bivariate tps where the supporting points are chosen sparsely to ensure that sources can not be fitted .",
    "the spline fits the background component whereas count enhancements classify pixels and pixel cells with source contributions .    in the following ,",
    "pixel cells are subsumed by pixels .",
    "pixel cells are collections of pixels where @xmath19 is the total photon count in the cell @xmath20 .",
    "the photon counts of neighbouring pixels are added up and the formed pixel cell is treated as a pixel . in principle , any cell shape can be chosen . in practice ,",
    "two methods have been developed when pixels have weight of one within the cell ( box filtering with cell shape of a square or of a circle ) and one method when pixels have different weights within the cell ( gaussian weighting ) .",
    "the box filter with cells of squared shape consists of taking information of neighbouring pixels within a box .",
    "the cell size is the box size .",
    "the box filter with cells of circular shape considers pixels with a weight of one if inside the cell size , otherwise zero .",
    "pixels have a weight of one when the cell size touches them at least at the centre .",
    "this method allows the pixel cells to have varying shapes .",
    "the gaussian weighting method provides gaussian weights around a centre : weights are given at decreasing values according to the distance from the centre .    as expressed in ( [ bt ] ) , we are interested in estimating the probabilities of the hypotheses : @xmath22 and @xmath25 .",
    "+ in this paper we address the problem when the photon counts are small and poisson statistics have to be used . the likelihood probabilities for the two hypotheses within poisson statistics",
    "are : @xmath27 this technique is easily adaptable to other likelihoods , for instance employing gaussian statistics as given in @xcite .",
    "+ the prior pdfs for the two complementary hypotheses are chosen to be @xmath28 and @xmath29 , independent of @xmath30 and @xmath31 . specifically , the parameter @xmath2 is the prior probability that a pixel contains only background .",
    "since it is not known if a certain pixel ( or pixel cell ) contains purely background or additional source signal , the likelihood for the mixture model is employed .",
    "the likelihood for the mixture model effectively combines the probability distributions for the two hypotheses , @xmath22 and @xmath25 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath20 corresponds to the pixels of the complete field .",
    "the probability of having source contribution in pixels and pixel cells is according to bayes theorem ( see @xcite ) : @xmath35 this equation enables the data contained in an astronomical image to be classified in two groups : with and without source signal contribution .",
    "equation ( [ eqsp1 ] ) is also used in the multi  resolution analysis .",
    "the spm with the largest resolution is characterized by the probability of uncorrelated pixels . at decreasing resolutions a correlation length",
    "is defined .",
    "starting from a value of @xmath36 , the correlation length increases in steps of @xmath36 pixel for decreasing resolution .",
    "the spms at decreasing resolutions are , therefore , characterized by the information provided by background and photon counts in pixel cells .",
    "specifically , photon counts and background counts are given by a weighted integration over pixel cells .",
