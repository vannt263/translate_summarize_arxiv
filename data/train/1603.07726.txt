    "the symmetric dddp has also been studied [ 4 ] as a scattering potential possessing oscillatory transmission coefficient @xmath11 as a function of energy . using the potential ( 1 ) , a subtle `` threshold anomaly '' in the scattering from one - dimensional attractive potential wells",
    "has been revealed earlier [ 5 ] . according to this the reflection probability becoming anomalous ( @xmath12 )",
    "is directly related to the fact whether the potential is at the threshold of possessing a bound state near @xmath2 . here",
    "we show a critical nature of this effect . this attractive double delta potential has also been studied for an interesting effect that the wigner s time - delay [ 6 ] at small energies is very large [ 7 ] if the potential supports a bound state near @xmath2 or if its strength is just enough to support another bound state .    notwithstanding",
    "the versatility and simplicity of this potential ( 1 ) , it has not been utilized fully in textbooks . here in this paper , we show that this is the simplest potential to introduce double wells , the rare avoided crossing of two levels in one - dimension , perfect transmission and resonances .",
    "also , in the textbooks , the utility of transmission ( @xmath13 ) and reflection ( @xmath14 ) amplitudes in extracting bound states , resonances and perfect transmission energies is not often discussed [ 2,3,6,9,10 ] . here in this paper , we first explain these connections in general and demonstrate the extraction of three discrete energy spectra of : bound states , resonances and perfect transmission from @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the general double dirac delta potential given as ( 1 ) .     .5 cm   .5 cm   + .5 cm   .5 cm   .5 cm",

    "every textbook [ 2,3,6,9 - 10 ] writes the general solution of @xmath24 in this case as @xmath25 for the region @xmath26 , the particular solution of schrdinger equation ( a combination of two linearly independent solutions ) for the given potential , is juxtaposed between these two solutions .",
    "one then matches the wave function and its derivative at @xmath27 to obtain the reflection and transmission amplitudes usually as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are functions of energy and mass of the particle and the potential parameters . by reversing the signs of the strengths of the potential barrier ( e.g. , @xmath30 in ( 1 ) we can get @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the well .",
    "let us change @xmath33 to @xmath34 in the equation _ a la _ ( 4 ) .",
    "so on the left , we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 on the right . in order to have bound states we demand the wave function to converge to zero as @xmath37 .",
    "this requires @xmath38 at @xmath39 , which in turn are the poles of @xmath40 and @xmath41 at negative energies , @xmath42 .",
    "one may also find the negative energy poles of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we would like to caution that in ref . [ 6 ] ( on page 109 in fig .",
    "6.9 ) the negative energy poles mistakenly appear as spikes of height 1 in the graph of @xmath45    students could be further instructed to find the poles of @xmath14 and @xmath13 that amounts to finding the zeros of @xmath46 , this turns the solutions ( 4 ) into gamow s pioneering idea [ 8,9 ] of out - going - wave boundary condition at the exit of the potential @xmath47 in case the potential possesses resonances , one gets the poles at @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "the solution @xmath50 of the time dependent schrdinger equation for the resonant state can be written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 , so that @xmath53 .",
    "one can see that the spatial part is an oscillating wave with growing amplitude ( spatial catastrophe ) for @xmath54 .",
    "similarly one can get spatial catastrophe on the left side @xmath55 time - wise , @xmath56 is well known as gamow s decaying state .",
    "these states have explained then enigmatic phenomenon of alpha - decay from nucleus [ 8 ] . recalling that hermitian hamiltonians have real eigenvalues",
    "is misplaced here as we are not imposing the condition of bound state that @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "also the spatial catastrophe @xmath59 in ( 7 ) will be controlled [ 9 ] by the time - wise decaying part @xmath60 .",
    "in the following we obtain the @xmath14 and @xmath13 from scattering states of the potential ( 1 ) ( @xmath61 in fig .",
    "1(a , b , c ) ) , we write the plane wave solution of ( 2 ) in different regions as @xmath62 as the potential ( 1 ) is zero excepting at two points @xmath27 where it is suddenly infinite and hence discontinuous .",
    "normally , the solution of schrdinger equation needs to be both continuous and differentiable .",
    "however , if a potential has the dirac delta discontinuity ( say ) at @xmath63 , such that @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is continuous at @xmath63 , the integration of ( 2 ) from @xmath66 to @xmath67 and then the limit as @xmath68 yields @xmath69 this is the well known condition of momentum mismatch due to dirac delta function [ 2,3,9,10 ] at @xmath63 .",
    "so the condition of continuity and ( 9 ) at @xmath27 gives the following equations .",

    "let us change in ( 11,12 ) @xmath73 which amounts to changing @xmath74 ( 8) to @xmath75 ( see ( 13 ) below ) .",
    "the poles of @xmath14 and @xmath13 are then given by @xmath76 for finding the bound state eigenvalues of the double delta wells ( fig .",
    "1(c ) ) one has to solve this implicit equation numerically . since this one - dimensional finite potential _",
    "well _ satisfies the condition that @xmath77 ( finite ) [ 11 ] , it will have at least one bound state eigenvalue .",
    "next , on the left of the eq .",
    "( 13 ) we have a quadratic ( parabolic ) function of @xmath78 and on the right we have a decreasing exponential , consequently they can cut each other at most at two values of @xmath78 .",
    "so there can be at most two discrete eigenvalues in the double delta well ( fig .",
    "let us first recover the well known results in the special cases .",
    "when @xmath79 this potential becomes a single delta well at @xmath80 with the strength as @xmath81 in this case from ( 13 ) , we get @xmath82 further if @xmath83 , we get the well known single eigenvalue of the dirac delta potential as @xmath84 [ 2,3,9,10 ] .",
    "next when @xmath85 , from ( 13 ) we get the eigenvalue equation in this case as @xmath86 if we take @xmath87 , the potential ( 1 ) becomes a delta well near a rigid wall ( fig .",
    "1(d ) ) which is a well studied potential [ 2,3 ] . for this case",
    "let us divide eq.(13 ) by @xmath88 and take the limit @xmath87 we get the eigenvalue equation as @xmath89 the single eigenvalue will occur only if @xmath90 .",
    "when @xmath88 is changed from 0 to @xmath91 the single eigenvalue of ( 1 ) ( fig .",
    "1(d ) ) will vary from @xmath92 to the root of the eq .",
    "so if the delta well is strong enough ( @xmath90 ) even the rigid wall perturbation at @xmath93 near the delta well can not remove the single bound level from the well .    again",

    "<S> we study a general double dirac delta potential to show that this is the simplest yet versatile solvable potential to introduce double wells , avoided crossings , resonances and perfect transmission ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> perfect transmission energies turn out to be the critical property of symmetric and anti - symmetric cases wherein these discrete energies are found to correspond to the eigenvalues of dirac delta potential placed symmetrically between two rigid walls . for well(s ) or barrier(s ) , perfect transmission [ or zero reflectivity , @xmath1 at energy @xmath2 is non - intuitive . </S>",
    "<S> however , earlier this has been found and called  threshold anomaly \" . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that it is a critical phenomenon and we can have @xmath3 when the parameters of the double delta potential satisfy an interesting condition . we also invoke zero - energy and zero curvature eigenstate ( @xmath4 ) of delta well between two symmetric rigid walls for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we resolve that the resonant energies and the perfect transmission energies are different and they arise differently . </S>"
