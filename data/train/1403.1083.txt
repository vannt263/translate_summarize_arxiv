    "pulsar radio emission is still not explained in details but it is believed to originate close to the pulsar surface ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the analysis of 62 mean profiles of 23 pulsars at different frequencies regarding aberration and retardation effects yielded the estimation of the emission height being below 1500 km , but most probably being of the order of 500 km above the pulsar surface .",
    "the advance in theoretical understanding of the emission mechanism and conditions in the magnetosphere have been driven mainly by the observations . recently",
    "many observations have been concentrated on observing single pulses which carry detailed information about the physics of radio emission .",
    "analysis of single pulse high resolution time series can show a few interesting properties i.e. giant and bright pulses , subpulse drift , nulling , microstructure , etc .",
    "observations of single pulses for most pulsars may be carried out mainly at lower frequencies because pulsars are weak radio sources at high frequencies which is clearly seen in their steep spectra .",
    "the pulsar spectrum in general can be described by a power law @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the spectral index . the average spectral index for 266 pulsars for frequency spread from 0.4 to 23  ghz is @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "the analysis of psr b1133 + 16 single pulses is a process that needs a certain amount of care .",
    "first off all , it is important to take into account different observational and technical effects that can affect recorded data , especially with very high time resolution .",
    "the effects that are presented in this paper play huge role and alter the data significantly . understanding of such effects and their influence on the data recording process is important for proper data reduction .",
    "some of the effects are not visible in the mean profiles but only in single pulses data .",
    "the mean profiles of psr b1133 + 16 at 4.85  ghz and 8.35  ghz consist of two components ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mean.profiles ] ) .",
    "the second component is emitted almost exclusively by low intensity individual pulses .",
    "on the other hand , the first component is seen in single pulses regardless of their intensity except for the cases when it is not present at all .",
    "however , lower intensity emission contributes mostly to the leading part of the first component whereas higher intensity single pulses contribute mainly to its trailing part ( fig .  [",
    "fig : intensity.ranges ] ) which was also reported by @xcite .",
    "the results of analysis of 4.85  ghz and 8.35  ghz data are consistent with previous studies by @xcite at 430  mhz but studies of b0329 + 54 @xcite show entirely opposite behaviour without full explanation .",
    "this inconsistency requires further studies of other pulsars single pulses to explain this effect .",
    "we show , in contradiction to studies at lower frequencies by @xcite , who report an almost uniform spread of single pulse maxima , that the maximum emission of b1133 + 16 single pulses at 4.85 and 8.35  ghz contributes almost exclusively to the trailing part of the leading component of the mean profile .",
    "our result is consistent with the behaviour at 341 , 626 , 1412 and 4850  hmz mentioned by @xcite and extends the studies up to 8.35 ghz .",
    "radio emission arises close to the pulsar surface at the distances of around 65 stellar radii at frequencies of 4.85  ghz and 8.35  ghz .",
    "weaker emission , which contributes to the leading part of the leading components , comes in earlier phases which suggests that originates in magnetosphere further from the pulsar surface than more energetic emission .",
    "our calculations shows , that the difference of the emission heights for stronger and weaker emission is of the order of a few stellar radii , amounting to a change of 1%2% of the emission height , which is consistent with previous estimations @xcite .",
    "there are 60 mean flux measurements in the literature of psr b1133 + 16 that are known to us .",
    "they span a very wide radio frequency range from 16.7  mhz up to 32  ghz . to reproduce the spectrum we fitted two different models : the broken power ",
    "law model and one based on flicker noise model of pulsar radio emission @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the model proposed by @xcite is not widely used in the literature although it reproduces the pulsar spectrum comparably well to the power - law model .",
    "future high time resolution observations might be useful to verify nano  pulse emission model .    due to the fact , that the pulsar radio emission is weaker at higher frequencies , giant pulses are the ones that can allow us to study closely their structure . in our both data samples",
    "there is roughly one per cent of bright pulses that are at least ten times stronger than mean flux and their microstructure is clearly visible .",
    "the presented results are based on the observations with the 100m telescope of the mpifr ( max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie ) at effelsberg .",
    "this work has been supported by polish national science centre grants dec-2011/03/d / st9/00656 ( kk , as ) , dec-2012/05/b / st9/03924 ( om ) and dec-2011/02/a / st9/00256 ( jd ) . data analysis and figures were partly prepared using r @xcite ."
