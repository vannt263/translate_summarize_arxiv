    "the sub - mjy radio source population has been the subject of considerable study over the last decade , particularly at 1.4  ghz , with observations pushing down to the @xmath3jy level ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "studies of the differential source counts derived from these observations allow us to probe how the different galaxy populations contribute to the total number of objects in the universe , and how the luminosity functions of these objects change with cosmic epoch .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the inflection in the differential source counts observed at @xmath10  mjy is due to the emergence of star - forming galaxies and radio - quiet agn , which begin to contribute significantly to the radio sky below @xmath10  mjy ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "an in - depth review of radio source counts and their implications is given by .",
    "there is significant scatter in different measurements of the differential source counts at 1.4  ghz , many of which do not agree with each other within their respective errors ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "there has been significant debate about the origin of this scatter , but @xcite showed that sample variance alone can not account for the differences found , pointing towards instrumental effects .",
    "interest in the faint radio sky was heightened by the absolute radiometer for cosmology , astrophysics and diffuse emission ( arcade2 ; @xcite ) balloon experiment , which showed that there was a significant excess in the sky brightness temperature at 3  ghz which can not be explained by current models @xcite .",
    "if this result is genuine , it suggests that there is a population of unknown radio sources at the @xmath3jy or njy level .",
    "the extragalactic source population at higher frequencies ( @xmath11  ghz ) has been much less widely studied , mostly due to the increased telescope time required to carry out a survey to an equivalent depth over a significant area at higher frequencies .",
    "one exception is the tenth cambridge ( 10c ; @xcite ) survey made with the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) large array @xcite , in the deep part of which 12  deg@xmath0 were observed at 15.7  ghz to a completeness limit of 0.5  mjy across ten different fields .",
    "study of the 10c sources @xcite has shown that their properties do not match those predicted by several leading models ( e.g.  ) , demonstrating the need to study this population rather than rely on extrapolations from lower frequencies .",
    "specifically , @xcite showed that there is a population of faint , flat - spectrum sources present in the 10c survey which is not predicted by the models .",
    "further study has shown that these sources are the cores of faint radio galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which are both more numerous and have flatter spectra than expected .",
    "a recent deeper continuation of the 10c survey ( 10c ultra - deep , @xcite ) has extended the 10c survey to 0.1  mjy in two fields . due to telescope scheduling ,",
    "the deeper of these 15.7  ghz surveys is in the ami001 field , a region of the sky with very little in the way of complementary data as the field was chosen purely on radio grounds . in order to investigate this sample further and constrain the proportions of different source types",
    "which contribute to this population it is vital that we have observations at other frequencies ; we have therefore used the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) to observe this field at 610 mhz .",
    "this paper describes these 610-mhz observations , and their implications for the nature of the higher - radio - frequency source population .",
    "the first part of this paper describes deep 610-mhz gmrt observations of the ami001 field ; in section  [ section : obs ] the observations and data reduction are explained , the source extraction is described in section  [ section : catalogue ] and the source counts are presented in section  [ section : counts ] .",
    "we then show how these observations can provide vital information about the higher - frequency population ; the spectral index distribution of a 15.7-ghz - selected sample is presented in section  [ section : alpha ] and the conclusions are given in section  [ section : conclusions ] .",
    "the ami001 field was observed with a single pointing centred on @xmath12 , @xmath2 ( j2000 coordinates , used throughout ) on 7  january 2012 with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) operating at 610  mhz .",
    "the pointing centre was chosen to be away from bright sources so as to minimise dynamic range issues . at this frequency",
    "the gmrt has a primary beam of 44 arcmin ( fwhm ) and an angular resolution of @xmath13 arcsec .",
    "the field was observed for 11 hours , including calibration , with a bandwidth of 32 mhz which was split into 256 spectral channels .",
    "the radio sources 3c286 and 3c48 were observed at the beginning , in the middle and at the end of the run as primary flux density calibrators . the nearby radio source j0029 + 346 was observed for 5 minutes every 30 minutes as a secondary flux density and phase calibrator .",
    "the total time on source was 400  minutes . the resulting @xmath14 coverage is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uv ] .     coverage .",
    "baselines shorter than 1  k@xmath15 were not included in the imaging and are omitted from this plot . ]",
    "the data reduction was performed using the astronomical image processing software ( aips ) package .",
    "the aips task setjy was used to calculate 610-mhz flux densities of 3c286 and 3c48 as 21.1 and 29.4 jy respectively @xcite .",
    "standard aips tasks were used to flag bad channels , baselines and antennas suffering from interference .",
    "a bandpass correction was then applied using the primary calibrators .",
    "five central channels which were relatively free from interference were averaged to create a pseudo - continuum channel and an antenna - based phase and amplitude calibration was created using observations of j0029 + 346 .",
    "this calibration was then applied to the full 256 channel dataset .",
    "the dataset was then compressed into 23 channels , each containing 10 original channels ( the first and last few spectral channels were omitted as they tend to have large bandpass corrections ) .",
    "further flagging was then performed on the 23 channel dataset .",
    "one antenna required re - weighting as it was noticed that the weights were discrepant .",
    "this was carried out using a custom aips task .",
    "if we had imaged the whole field at once the non - planar nature of the sky would have caused the introduction of phase errors . to avoid this , the field was split into 31 smaller facets",
    "which were imaged separately with different phase centres , and then recombined .",
    "an additional six small facets around bright sources outside the imaging area were also included to account for contributions from these sources .",
    "jy . ]    the lack of bright sources in the field meant that care had to be taken when performing the self - calibration ( the brightest source in the field has a flux density of 8  mjy ) .",
    "for the self - calibration a lower resolution image , with beam size 8.3  arcsec , was created .",
    "this lower - resolution image then went through three iterations of phase self - calibration with 15- , 5- and 2-minute solution intervals before a final iteration of phase and amplitude self - calibration with 15-minute intervals .",
    "the overall amplitude gain was held constant to ensure the flux density of the sources was not altered . a final , full resolution image",
    "was then created with a synthesised beam size of @xmath16 , pa @xmath17 and with a pixel size of 1.4  arcsec to ensure the beam was oversampled .",
    "natural weighting was used ( imagr parameter robust = 5 ) ; baselines shorter than 1  k@xmath15 were omitted from the imaging as the gmrt has a large number of short baselines which would otherwise dominate the beam shape , and are also prone to interference .",

    "the source fitting was carried out using the source_find software , which is described in @xcite and summarised briefly here .",
    "a noise map is produced by the software as follows ; at each pixel position , the noise is taken as the r.m.s .  inside a square centred on the pixel with a width of approximately ten times the synthesized beam .",

    "there are @xmath49 synthesised beams in the map , so we expect less than one false detection in the image .",
    "residual phase and amplitude errors mean that the noise is not purely gaussian . to investigate the effects that these may have on the false detection rate we have run the source - finding algorithm on an inverted image .",
    "the rationale behind this is that noise fluctuations are equally likely to be positive or negative , but we expect signals from real sources to be positive only .",
    "the source finding algorithm only detects positive peaks , so by inverting the image and running source_find on the inverted map in exactly the same way as described in section  [ section : source_finding ] any sources detected result from noise on the map .",
    "14 sources were detected in the inverted image ( compared to 955 in the real image ) , giving a false detection rate of 1.5  per cent , which indicates , as expected , that the noise in the image is not purely gaussian .",

    "the half - power beam width ( hpbw ) of the primary beam varies slightly between the gmrt antennas . to test the effect that this might have on the final images ,",
    "two different images were made , one with a hpbw of 44.0  arcmin and one with 44.8  arcmin ( a value of 44.4  arcmin was used in the image described in section  [ section : obs ] ) .",
    "these values represent an over - estimate of the possible range of the mean hpbw , as the variations between the individual antennas is @xmath51  arcmin ( n. g. kantharia , private communication ) , resulting in an estimated error on the mean hbpw of 0.3  arcmin .",
    "the source fitting procedure described in section  [ section : source_finding ] was carried out on both of these images and the resulting two catalogues were compared .",
    "these two catalogues proved to be extremely similar : all the sources in one image were found in the other and vice versa and the ratio of the flux densities in the two images is @xmath52 .",
    "thus the possible small variations in the hpbw value used when applying the primary beam correction to the final image do not have a significant effect on the sources detected in the image .",
    "there are two other catalogues available in this field : the 10c survey @xcite and the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) very large array ( vla ) sky survey ( nvss ; @xcite ) .",
    "both of these catalogues are relatively low resolution , with synthesised beam sizes of 30 and 45 arcsec respectively ; this means they are not ideal for assessing the astrometric accuracy of our catalogue ( this field is not covered by the faint images of the radio sky and twenty - one cm ) .",
    "nevertheless we matched our source catalogue to both the 10c ultra - deep and nvss catalogues ( using a match radius of 15  arcsec in both cases ) and found 132 matches to the 10c ultra - deep catalogue and 56 to nvss ( see section  [ section : matching ] for further details of the matching to the 10c catalogue ) .",

    "@xcite studied the spectral index distribution of sources selected from the 10c survey at 15.7 ghz and found a significant change with flux density ; above @xmath64  mjy the sample was dominated by steep - spectrum sources , while at @xmath65  mjy sources with much flatter spectra dominated the population .",
    "this showed that the nature of the population was changing as flux density decreased .",

    "the difference in resolution between the 610-mhz and 15.7-ghz observations can cause problems when matching the two catalogues , as sources which are unresolved in the ami data may be resolved into several components in the gmrt data .",
    "we therefore extracted 2.5  arcmin ` postage stamp ' images from the gmrt map at the position of each 10c source and examined them by eye .",

    "[ fig : alpha_frac ] shows the fraction of steep - spectrum ( @xmath62 ) sources in the same flux density bins for the three samples and indicates that the proportion of steep - spectrum sources decreases as flux density decreases .",
    "these results suggest that star - forming galaxies are not making a significant contribution to the 15.7-ghz source population at flux densities down to @xmath74 , as these sources typically have steeper spectra ( with @xmath75 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusions of @xcite , who used the 10c ultra - deep data to calculate the 15.7-ghz source counts down to 0.1  mjy and found no evidence for the emergence of a significant new population of sources , such as star - forming galaxies .",
    "it is in contrast to the predictions made by the skads simulated skies @xcite , which predicts that 20 per cent of the sources with @xmath76 should be star - forming galaxies .",
    "it seems that star - forming galaxies are not contributing to the high - frequency source population at the levels predicted by the simulation .",
    "assuming they have steep spectra , the population of star - forming galaxies which are responsible for the inflection in the 1.4-ghz source counts observed at 1  mjy ( e.g.  @xcite ) should begin to contribute to the 15.7-ghz source counts at around @xmath9  mjy , the limit of this study .",
    "extending this work to fainter flux densities should therefore allow us to detect these star - forming galaxies , and see whether or not they contribute to the high - frequency sky at the levels expected at fainter flux densities .",
    "we refer the reader to section  7 of @xcite for a recent review of the future prospects for studying the faint radio sky with upcoming surveys .",
    "we have made new 610-mhz observations with the gmrt of 0.84  deg@xmath0 with a lowest r.m.s .",
    "noise of 18  @xmath3jy beam@xmath4 .",
    "the differential source counts derived from these observations between @xmath77 are in agreement with other work within the expected scatter between different surveys .",
    "the ska simulated skies underestimate the euclidean normalised source counts by a factor of 1.4 at @xmath78  mjy ; however as this difference is a similar order of magnitude to the scatter found between different surveys , it could be due to cosmic variance and instrumental effects rather than a failure in the model .",
    "these deep 610  mhz observations enable us to investigate the spectral index distribution of an unique sample of radio sources selected at 15.7  ghz .",
    "we find that this population continues to be dominated by flat spectrum sources down to @xmath9  mjy , with a median spectral index of @xmath8 between @xmath7 .",
    "this suggests that star - forming galaxies make no significant contribution to this population .",
