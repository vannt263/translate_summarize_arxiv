    "these high energy electron - proton interactions provide a testing ground for the standard model ( sm ) complementary to @xmath6 and @xmath7 scattering , giving access to rare processes with cross sections below @xmath0  pb .",

    "neutral current deep inelastic scattering ( nc dis ) is measured at hera for values of the photon virtuality @xmath8 up to about @xmath9 gev@xmath10 . at the highest @xmath8 , a good agreement between the data and the sm expectation , derived from the dglap evolution of parton density functions determined at lower @xmath8 , is observed .",
    "stringent constraints on new physics can thus be set .",

    "new interactions between electrons and quarks with caracteristic mass scale in the tev range may also modify the cross section at high @xmath8 via virtual effects .",
    "many such interactions can be modelled as a four - fermion contact interaction . currently , the zeus data constrain the effective scale @xmath15 of @xmath16 contact interactions to be larger than @xmath17 to @xmath18 tev , depending on the model , as presented in figure  [ fig : ci ] .    % c.l . on @xmath15 for various contact interaction scenario from recent zeus data .",
