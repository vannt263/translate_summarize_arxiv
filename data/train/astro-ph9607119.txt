    "the low heavy - element abundance in sbs 0335052 implies that this galaxy could be a nearby young galaxy experiencing its first burst of star formation .",
    "several new studies found additional evidence for the youth of sbs 0335052 .",

    "1995 ) have derived the carbon abundance in this galaxy from hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xmath26 spectra and found a c / o abundance ratio @xmath5 5 times lower than that in the sun .",

    "such observations are important in that they allow us to estimate the primordial helium abundance of extremely low - metallicity bcgs .",
    "izotov , thuan & lipovetsky ( 1996 ) have shown that the primordial helium abundance can not be estimated accurately for i zw 18 because of the peculiarity of its hei emission line intensities .",

    "it is known that the electron temperature , @xmath4 , is different in high- and low - ionization zones of hii regions ( stasinska 1990 ) , and we have chosen to determine @xmath4(oiii ) from the [ oiii]@xmath14363/(@xmath14959+@xmath15007 ) ratio and @xmath41(sii ) from the [ sii]@xmath1@xmath16717/@xmath16731 ratio .",

    "it is well established theoretically that the oxygen seen in hii regions is a primary element produced by massive stars with m@xmath2910m@xmath15 .",
    "other @xmath16-process elements seen in the spectra of hii regions , such as neon , argon , and sulfur , are generally thought to be primary as well .",
    "the ne / o , s / o and ar / o ratios are independent of o / h ( vigroux , stasinska & comte 1987 ; garnett 1989 ; thuan , izotov & lipovetsky 1995 ; izotov , thuan & lipovetsky 1996 ) .",
    "the situation for nitrogen is more complex . while in spiral galaxies",

    "0335052 we derive an oxygen abundance , 12 + log ( o / h ) = 7.33@xmath00.01 , somewhat larger than value 7.30 derived by melnick , heydari - malayeri & leisy ( 1992 ) . the value of 12 + log ( o / h ) = 7.0  7.1 found by izotov et al .",
    "( 1990ab ) was an underestimate caused mainly by nonlinearity of the detectors used and by saturation of strong emission lines .    in figure 3",
    "we show the n / o , ne / o , ar / o and s / o ratios for sbs 0335052 ( filled circles ) .",
    "we also show the data from thuan , izotov & lipovetsky ( 1995 ) and izotov , thuan & lipovetsky ( 1996 ) ( open circles ) for a sample of low - metallicity bcgs .",
    "we used the [ nii ] @xmath16584 emission line to derive the nitrogen abundance for sbs 0335052 .",
    "however , our relatively low spectral resolution is insufficient to resolve it from h@xmath16 and its intensity was derived after subtraction of the broad h@xmath16 wings .",
    "therefore , the derived nitrogen abundance is somewhat uncertain and higher spectral resolution observations are needed to improve this value . as it is evident from figure 3 , the n / o , ar / o and s / o abundance ratios in sbs 0335052 are in excellent agreement with those derived for other bcgs , and we confirm the important conclusion by thuan , izotov & lipovetsky ( 1995 ) that all these elements in low - metallicity bcgs are primary elements produced by the same massive stars",
    "this result is especially important for nitrogen . while our data show that nitrogen in low - metallicity bcgs is a primary element , pettini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found very low n / o ratio in low - metallicity high - redshift absorbing clouds which is at variance with the data for bcgs , suggesting the presence of a significant amount of nitrogen , produced as a secondary element .",
    "timmes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have noted that no primary nitrogen is produced in the standard massive star models .",
    "however , if numerical parameters governing convective overshoot are enlarged , primary nitrogen is produced in all low metallicity massive stars with m@xmath4530m@xmath15 .",
    "the synthesis of primary nitrogen in these low metallicity massive stars occurs as the convective helium burning shell penetrates into the hydrogen shell with violent , almost explosive consequences . on the other hand , in massive stars with solar metallicity",
    "no primary nitrogen is produced even with enhanced overshoot .",
    "thus , chemical evolution models with primary nitrogen production in low - metallicity massive stars can explain the observed lack of secondary nitrogen in bcgs and the small dispersion in log(n / o ) .",
    "we have detected the [ feiii]@xmath14658 emission line in the spectrum of sbs 0335052 and have derived the iron abundance in hii region .",
    "iron is a primary element produced during explosive nucleosynthesis either in type i supernovae ( sn i s ) with low - mass progenitors or in type ii supernovae ( sn ii s ) with more massive progenitors ( weaver & woosley 1993 ; woosley & weaver 1995 ) . due to the difference in evolution timescales of type i and type ii supernova progenitors , sn i s begin to contribute only when the age of the system is @xmath2910@xmath30yr .",
    "therefore , the fe / o ratio provides an important constraint on galaxy chemical evolution models .",
    "however , there remain uncertainties concerning models of explosive nucleosynthesis due to the uncertainties in central collapsing core parameters and the initial conditions for the shock wave in the supernova progenitor .",
    "it was shown by thuan , izotov & lipovetsky ( 1995 ) that o / fe in bcgs is overabundant by @xmath50.34 dex , the same overabundance found in galactic halo stars .",
    "this implies a similar chemical enrichment history for bcgs and the galactic halo .",
    "the comparison of the observed fe / o abundance ratio and theoretical fe / o yield ratio in bcgs favors massive star explosive nucleosynthesis models with reduced iron production .",
    "we show in figure 4 [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] for the bcgs in the sample from thuan , izotov & lipovetsky ( 1995 ) and izotov , thuan & lipovetsky ( 1996 ) ( open circles ) along with [ o / fe ] for sbs 0335052 ( filled circles ) , derived in this paper . for the solar abundance",
    "we adopt 12 + log(fe / h)@xmath15 = 7.51 consistent with the meteoritic value ( holweger et al .",
    "1991 ; bimont et al .",
    "1991 ; hannaford et al .",
    "1992 ) . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the data for galactic disk and halo stars ( points ) from edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , barbuy ( 1988 ) and barbuy & erdelyi - mendes ( 1989 ) . while other bcgs show significant overabundance of oxygen relative to iron , the o / fe abundance ratio in sbs 0335052 is close to solar .",
    "the reason for such difference is not clear .",
    "we can only propose several possibilities : a ) the contribution of iron from type i sne is large in sbs 0335052 due to the presence of a significant ( but undetected ) stellar population with age @xmath2910@xmath30yr ; however , [ feiii ] lines are detected in the region of present star formation and , therefore , we do not believe the significant iron yield from sn i s ; b ) [ feiii]@xmath14658 emission line in the spectrum of sbs 0335052 is contaminated by wolf - rayet ciii @xmath14658 emission .",
    "however , the @xmath14658 line is narrow , atypical of wr lines , and we do not detect any other evidence for wr features in the spectrum of sbs 0335052 ; c ) iron in other bcgs is significantly depleted due to the dust formation ; d ) uncertainties in the ionization correction factor ( icf ) for iron .",
    "icf(fe ) is large ( table 2 ) and dependent on the o / o@xmath42 ionic ratio , where o = o@xmath42 + o@xmath43 .",
    "therefore , uncertainties in o@xmath42 abundance could significantly influence iron abundance .",
    "however , this explanation is implausible because icf(n ) also scales with o / o@xmath42 , whereas n / o in sbs 0335052 is normal .      the extremely low oxygen abundance in sbs 0335052 and high surface brightness of its hii region implies that this galaxy is one of the best objects for determining the helium abundance at low metallicity .",
    "the high s / n ratio spectrum obtained for sbs 0335052 ( figure 2 ) allows us to measure helium line intensities with good accuracy .",
    "the hei line intensities corrected for interstellar extinction are shown in the table 1 .",
    "for the helium abundance determination we use the hei @xmath14471 , @xmath15876 and @xmath16678 emission lines . however , hei line intensities deviate from the pure recombination values ( izotov , thuan & lipovetsky 1996 ) and must be corrected .",
    "the main mechanism changing the hei line intensities from their recombination values is collisional excitation from the metastable 2@xmath46s level .",
    "this mechanism depends on electron temperature and electron number density and is significant in sbs 0335052 because of the high electron temperature @xmath4=19200k in its hii region .",
    "the line most sensitive to collisional enhancement in optical range is hei @xmath17065 .",
    "another mechanism which could drive hei line intensities from their recombination values is self - absorption in some optically thick emission lines , such as hei @xmath13889 .",
    "the emission lines most sensitive to this fluorescence mechanism are hei @xmath13889 and @xmath17065 . in contrast to collisional enhancement , which increases the intensities of all hei lines",
    ", the fluorescence mechanism works in such a way as to decrease the intensity of the hei @xmath13889 line as its optical depth increases , while increasing the intensities of other lines of interest ( hei @xmath14471 , @xmath15876 , @xmath16678 and @xmath17065 ) .    in sbs 0335052 such fluorescent enhancement could be important .",
    "since hei @xmath13889 is blended with h8 @xmath13889 , we have subtracted the latter , assuming its intensity to be equal to 0.106 i(h@xmath11 ) ( aller 1984 ) .",
    "then the intensity of hei @xmath13889 corrected for interstellar extinction is equal to 0.065 i(h@xmath11 ) , which gives an observationally inferred ratio i(@xmath13889)/i(@xmath15876 ) = 0.65 compared to the recombination value of 1.08 at @xmath4 = 20000k ( brocklehurst 1972 ) .",
    "taking into account that collisional enhancement factors for hei @xmath13889 and @xmath15876 emission lines are nearly the same ( kingdon & ferland 1995 ) we conclude that the intensity of hei @xmath13889 is reduced due to self - absorption . to correct hei emission line intensities for collisional and fluorescent enhancement we follow the approach described by izotov , thuan & lipovetsky ( 1996 ) .",
    "we assume that the electron temperature in he@xmath42 zone is equal to that in the o@xmath43 zone .",
    "however , we do not use the electron number density derived from [ sii ] @xmath16717/@xmath16731 for two reasons : 1 ) the s@xmath42 and he@xmath42 zones not coincide ; 2 ) although the electron number density @xmath41(sii)=393 @xmath47 is definitely larger than the low density limit for the [ sii ] line ratio , we find that the width of [ sii]@xmath16731 for unknown reasons is 9% larger than that of [ sii]@xmath16717 .",
    "therefore , rather than using @xmath41(sii ) , we take into consideration 5 hei emission lines : @xmath13889 , @xmath14471 , @xmath15876 , @xmath16678 and @xmath17065 and solve problem self - consistently to reproduce the theoretical hei line intensity recombination ratios for two unknown quantities : 1 ) the electron number density in the he@xmath42 zone and 2 ) the optical depth @xmath48(@xmath13889 ) in hei @xmath13889 line .",
    "the best solution is found for electron number density @xmath41(he@xmath42)= 153 @xmath47 and optical depth @xmath48(@xmath13889)=1.5 .",
    "the helium abundance for individual lines along with correction factors for collisional and fluorescent enhancement are given in table 3 .",
    "the helium mass fraction in sbs 0335052 , y=0.245@xmath00.006 , is in close agreement with that derived for other low - metallicity bcgs and is close to the primordial helium mass fraction y@xmath2=0.243@xmath00.003 derived by izotov , thuan & lipovetsky ( 1996 ) .",
    "the presence of large number of massive stars in the central part of sbs 0335052 implies that the enrichment of ionized gas with heavy elements occured in the short time scale of @xmath5 10@xmath4910@xmath13yr , comparable to the lifetime of massive stars .",
    "the scenario of self - enriched giant hii regions has been proposed by kunth & sargent ( 1986 ) , who suggest that new heavy element ejecta originating from stellar winds and supernovae of type ii initially mix exclusively with the ionized gas in the hii zone , waiting for further mixing with the cold gas during the long interburst phase .",
    "roy & kunth ( 1995 ) have analyzed different mechanisms of interstellar medium mixing and found that ionized gas is well mixed due to rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholz instabilities on time scales 1.5@xmath2710@xmath49 yr within regions of 100 pc size .",

    "however , this would not seem to be the case for sbs 0335052 where , because of its very low metallicity , wr stars are unlikely to exist .",
    "we suggest that the strong heii @xmath14686 emission line is connected in some way with evolved massive stars ; however , the particular mechanism ( massive x - ray binaries , shocks from supernovae , and others ) is at present unknown .",
    "we use emission line intensities along the slit oriented in se ",
    "nw direction to model colors @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath10 and @xmath9 of pure gaseous emission at electron temperature @xmath4=20000k .",
    "taking into consideration free - free , bound - free , two - photon continuum emission and equivalent widths for emission lines we found good agreement between observed and theoretical @xmath10 and @xmath9 colors suggesting in favor of a significant contribution of gaseous emission in extended low - intensity envelope .",
    "however , observed equivalent width of h@xmath11 emission line is @xmath5 23 times lower than value expected from pure gaseous emission . besides that",
    ", we found that @xmath10 and @xmath9 colors of gaseous continuum at @xmath4=20000k are close to those for stellar population with age 10@xmath14yr . at last , widths of h@xmath12 and h@xmath11 lines are narrower than instrumental profiles , probably , due to presence of underlying stellar absorption from a stars .",
    "these arguments suggest in favor of an older stellar population with age @xmath510@xmath14yr , which gives @xmath52/3 of the light in the stellar continuum outside of the inner region @xmath5500 pc in diameter where the young clusters reside .",
    "we estimate the mass of older stellar population of @xmath510@xmath13m@xmath15 , which is significantly lower ( 2 orders of magnitude ) than the mass of neutral gas in sbs 0335052 , but it is comparable with mass of present burst of star formation .",
    "hence , observational data suggest that sbs 0335052 is young galaxy with age of @xmath510@xmath14yr experiencing now at least the short episode of star formation with duration @xmath32 10@xmath13yr , or the episode of propagating star formation in the direction nw  se with duration of 10@xmath14 yr , as suggested in part by the color gradient for stellar clusters found by thuan , izotov & lipovetsky ( 1996 ) . to confirm the presence of an underlying stellar component , it is important to derive the @xmath66 color , which is very different for gaseous and stellar emission .",
