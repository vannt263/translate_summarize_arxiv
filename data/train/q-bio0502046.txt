    "biological evolution presents many problems concerning highly nonlinear , nonequilibrium systems of interacting entities that are well suited for study by methods from statistical mechanics .",
    "an excellent review of this rapidly growing field is found in ref .  .",
    "among these problems are those concerned with _ coevolution _ : the simultaneous evolution of many species , whose mutual interactions produce a constantly changing _ fitness landscape_. throughout this process , new species are created and old species go extinct . a question that is still debated in evolutionary biology is whether evolution on the macroscale proceeds gradually or in ` fits and starts , ' as suggested by eldredge and gould.@xcite in the latter mode , known as _ punctuated equilibria _ , species and communities appear to remain largely unchanged for long periods of time , interrupted by brief ( on a geological timescale ) periods of mass extinctions and rapid change .",
    "a coevolution process involves a large range of timescales , from the ecologically relevant scales of a few generations , to geological scales of millions or billions of generations .",
    "traditionally , models of macroevolution have been constructed on a highly coarse - grained timescale .",
    "( the best - known such model to physicists is probably the bak - sneppen model.@xcite ) however , the long - time dynamics of the evolution is clearly driven by ecological processes , mutations , and selection at comparatively short timescales . as a result , in recent years several new models have been proposed that are designed to span the disparate ecological and evolutionary timescales .",
    "these models include the webworld model,@xcite the tangled - nature model,@xcite and simplified versions of the latter.@xcite in this paper i discuss and compare some of the properties of fluctuations in two simplified coevolution models : the model introduced in ref .   and a different model that i am currently developing.@xcite    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : mod ] i introduce the two models , in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] i compare and discuss numerical results from large - scale monte carlo simulations for the different models , and in sec .  [ sec : conc ] i present a summary and conclusions .",
    "both of the models studied here consider haploid species whose genome is represented by a bit string of length @xmath0 , so that there are a total of @xmath1 potential species , labeled by an index @xmath2 $ ] . at the end of each generation , an individual of species @xmath3 can with probability @xmath4 give rise to @xmath5 offspring and then die , or with probability @xmath6 it dies without offspring .",
    "the fecundity @xmath5 is assumed fixed and will be chosen appropriately for each model as discussed below . during its birth ,",
    "an offspring individual may undergo mutation with a small probability @xmath7 per bit in its genome . during a mutation event ,",
    "a bit in the genome is flipped , and the mutated offspring individual is considered as belonging to a different species than its parent .",
    "the reproduction probability @xmath8 of species @xmath3 in generation @xmath9 depends on the interactions of individuals of that species with other species , @xmath10 , that are present in the community with nonzero populations @xmath11 , as well as possibly on its ability to utilize an external resource , @xmath12 .",
    "it is given by the convenient nonlinear form , @xmath13 } \\ ; , \\label{eq - pi}\\ ] ] which resembles the acceptance probability in a monte carlo simulation using glauber transition rates.@xcite the function @xmath14 depends linearly on the set of all nonzero populations in generation @xmath9 , @xmath15 , and possibly also on the external resource @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath14 is large and negative , the reproduction probability is near unity , while large positive values lead to a low reproduction probability .",
    "the coupling to the @xmath11 is effected via the interaction matrix @xmath16 , whose elements @xmath17 are chosen randomly ( with restrictions discussed below for the individual models ) from a uniform distribution on @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath19 and @xmath20 , species @xmath3 is a predator and @xmath10 its prey , or _ vice versa _ , while @xmath17 and @xmath21 both positive denotes mutualism or symbiosis , and both negative denote competition .",
    "once @xmath16 is chosen at the beginning of a simulation , it remains fixed (  quenched randomness \" ) .",
    "these interactions ( together with other , model - specific parameters ) determine whether or not a species will have a sufficient reproduction probability to be successful _ in a particular community _ of other species .",
    "typically , only a small subset of species have nonzero populations at any one time , forming a community .",
    "* model a : * + in model a , which was introduced and studied in refs .",
    ", @xmath14 takes the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total population at @xmath9 . in this model , the verhulst factor @xmath24 prevents the population from indefinite growth and can be seen as representing an environmental  carrying capacity.\"@xcite the interaction matrix has elements that are randomly distributed over @xmath18 $ ] , except that @xmath25 to focus on the effects of interspecies interactions . here , model a will be simulated with the following parameter values : @xmath26 ( see below ) , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "* model b : * + the new model b is a predator / prey model .",
    "it is somewhat more realistic than model a in that the population is maintained by a subset of the species that can utilize the external resource @xmath12 ( primary producers , or autotrophs ) .",
    "other species can maintain themselves only by predation on one or more of the producer species ( consumers , or heterotrophs ) .",
    "these modifications lead to the restrictions that the off - diagonal part of @xmath16 must be antisymmetric , and further that if @xmath3 is a producer and @xmath10 a consumer , then @xmath3 must be the prey of @xmath10 , so that @xmath29 . to avoid runaway population growth ,",
    "the diagonal elements are chosen randomly on @xmath30 .",
    "such negative self interactions are commonly used in population dynamics models.@xcite the specific form of @xmath14 in this model is @xmath31 where @xmath32 can be seen as a  cost of reproduction , \" and @xmath33 is the coupling to the external resource .",
    "the latter is positive for producers and zero for consumers . in this implementation of the model , both @xmath34 and the nonzero @xmath35 are chosen uniformly from @xmath36 $ ] at the beginning of the simulation and kept fixed thereafter . here , model b will be simulated with the following parameter values : @xmath37 ( see below ) , @xmath38 , and @xmath28 .",
    "only 5% of the potential species are producers ( i.e. , have @xmath39 ) , and in order to obtain food webs with more realistic connectivity , 90% of the @xmath40 pairs are randomly chosen to be zero , giving a _ connectance_@xcite of 10% , while the elements of the nonzero pairs are chosen on @xmath18 $ ] as described above .",
    "both models are sufficiently simple that the populations and stabilities of fixed - point communities can be obtained analytically for zero mutation rate .",
    "these analytical results are extensively compared with simulations in refs .  , and  .",
    "for the purposes of the present study i just mention that the analytical stability results yield intervals for the fecundity @xmath5 , inside which it is ensured that a fixed - point community in the absence of mutations is stable toward small deviations in all directions .",
    "the values of @xmath5 used here are chosen to yield such stable fixed - point communities for both models .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper i have discussed the fluctuations in two different , simplified models of biological macroevolution that both are based on the birth / death behavior of single individuals on the ecological timescale . on evolutionary timescales",
    "both models give rise to power - law distributions of characteristic waiting times and power spectra that exhibit @xmath41 like flicker noise , in agreement with some interpretations of the fossil record.@xcite the main difference in the construction of the models is that in model a the population size is controlled by a verhulst factor , while in model b the population is maintained by a small percentage of the species that have the ability to directly utilize an external resource ( producers or autotrophs ) .",
    "all other species must maintain themselves as predators ( consumers or heterotrophs ) .",
    "in both models the probability density of the lifetimes of individual species follows a 1/time@xmath42 power law and , consistently , the power spectra of the time series of diversity and extinction sizes show @xmath41 noise .",
    "however , the probability density of quiet periods , defined as the times between events when the magnitude of the logarithmic derivative of the diversity exceeds a given cutoff , behaves differently in the two models . in model b",
    ", the quiet - period distribution goes as 1/time , consistent with the universality class of the zero - dimensional bak - sneppen model .",
    "in contrast , in model a the behavior is proportional to 1/time@xmath42 , like the lifetimes of individual species .",
    "the difference between the behaviors can be linked to the lower degree of synchronization between extinction events in model b. it remains a topic for further research to see whether this difference extends to more realistic modifications of model b.    i thank r.  k.  p.  zia for a pleasant and fruitful collaboration in formulating and studying model a , v.  sevim for the data on model a that appear in fig .",
