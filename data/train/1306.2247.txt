    "a globular cluster system ( gcs ) is the ensemble of all such star clusters within a given galaxy .",
    "the history of gcs studies in the astronomical literature can properly be said to begin with shapley s ( 1918 ) work on the milky way gcs , which he used to make the first reliable estimate of the distance to the galactic center .",
    "next pioneering steps were taken with reconnaisance of the m31 gcs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) and the other local group galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews of this early history ) . however , it was not until discovery and measurement of the rich gc populations around the virgo elliptical galaxies had begun @xcite that gcs studies began to emerge as a distinct field .",
    "it is now realized that virtually all galaxies more luminous than @xmath12 ( that is , all but the tiniest dwarfs ) contain old globular clusters , and that these massive , compact star clusters represent a common thread in the earliest star formation history in every type of galaxy .",
    "the first ` catalog ' of gcss @xcite listed just 27 galaxies , all from either the local group or the virgo cluster . by 1991",
    "the number had grown to 60 @xcite and a decade later to 73 @xcite , with the sample starting to include galaxies in a wider range of environments .",
    "other compilations for different purposes were put together by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    in the past decade , many new surveys of gcss for galaxies throughout the nearby universe have taken place . the relevance of gcs properties to understanding galactic structure and early evolution is becoming increasingly apparent , so the construction of a complete new catalog is well justified .",
    "a new list may reveal large - scale trends of gcs properties with galaxy type or environment , and may also provide a springboard for designing new studies .",
    "perhaps the most basic question , and one that dates back decades , is simply to ask what determines the total population of gcs in a galaxy .",
    "the total gc population size , @xmath0 , must relate to the gc formation efficiency relative to the field - star population as well as to the later dynamical evolution of the system . in this paper",
    ", we address these questions by using a newly constructed gcs catalog to search for correlations of cluster population size with several other global properties of their host galaxies .",
    "we have carried out an extensive literature search to find published studies of galaxies that , at a minimum , give some useful , quantitative information for the total number @xmath0 of its globular clusters .",
    "much of this material now comes from a few recent major surveys that have the distinct advantage of being internally homogeneous , such as for the virgo cluster galaxies @xcite , the fornax cluster @xcite , nearby dwarf galaxies @xcite , nearby e and s0 galaxies @xcite , and supergiant e galaxies @xcite .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) cameras including wfpc2 , acs , and most recently wfc3 have provided a powerful stimulus for the imaging and photometry that such surveys depend on .",
    "however , dozens of other gcs studies exist that are widely scattered through the literature and we have searched thoroughly for these as well .",
    "in total we have extracted gcs data from 112 papers published up to december 2012 .",
    "these yield @xmath0 measurements for 422 individual galaxies , a dramatic increase over previous compilations .    the distribution by distance for the galaxies in the catalog is shown in figure 1 . here , the predominance of targets in the virgo - to - fornax distance range ( @xmath13 mpc ) is obvious , but the numbers of more remote galaxies are gradually increasing as new work goes on .",
    "in general , the hst cameras can reach gcss reliably for @xmath14 mpc ( about twice the coma cluster distance ) , the necessary exposure times becoming quite large beyond that ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) . by comparison ,",
    "gcs measurement through ground - based imaging becomes difficult for @xmath15 mpc even with 8-meter - class telescopes , an empirical limit that partly determines the steep dropoff of targets beyond that distance .",
    "the complete catalog with literature sources is included in the published electronic version of this paper , and can also be obtained from the website of the first author at http://physwww.mcmaster.ca/@xmath16harris/databases.html .",
    "in addition to @xmath0 , we include some selected observational parameters describing the luminosities , masses , and scale sizes of the galaxies and that are available for most of the objects in the list .",
    "the full catalog contains the following information :    * galaxy identification ( from more than one catalog source if appropriate ) . * right ascension and declination ( j2000 ) . *",
    "morphological type .",
    "* foreground absorption @xmath17 , from ned ( nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) .",
    "* distance @xmath18 , primarily from the raw data in ned .",
    "for relatively nearby galaxies , wherever possible we adopt @xmath19values measured from primary standard candles based on resolved stellar populations ( cepheids , red - giant - branch - tip stars , planetary nebulae luminosity functions , mira stars , rr lyrae stars ) .",
    "surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) measured from integrated light are also used as a standard candle .",
    "for each such galaxy we adopt the average of the most recent individual measurements of those six primary methods ( we emphasize that our adopted values are _ not _ the averages given in ned ) . for some slightly more distant galaxies for which these primary indicators are not available , we use recent determinations from the tully - fisher relation as listed in ned . for still more distant systems ( @xmath20 mpc )",
    "we use hubble s law with @xmath21 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 and with the galaxy radial velocity corrected to the cmb reference frame . *",
    "absolute visual magnitude @xmath23 , calculated from the distance modulus and the integrated magnitude @xmath24 if available from ned . in other cases",

    "\\(1 ) the only quantities available for _ all _ the galaxies in the catalog are @xmath0 , galaxy type , and luminosity @xmath23 . in principle , a total magnitude obtained from a near - infrared band such as @xmath36 , or @xmath29 is a better photometric proxy for total stellar _ mass _ than are optical bands .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p08 , v10 ) , but at present we place most of our reliance on absolute visual magnitudes because these are available for all of the targets , and allow us to compare various results readily with earlier work . in the discussion",
    "below , we also present some correlations with @xmath37 from the 2mass @xmath30 data , but these generally do not exhibit any smaller scatter than the ones using @xmath23 .",
    "\\(2 ) the velocity dispersion @xmath2 is a key quantity in many studies of the `` fundamental plane '' ( fp ) of early - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) .",
    "it is a critical element to dynamical estimates of galaxy mass ( see below ) , and is a valuable indicator of the depth of the galaxy s potential well @xcite .",
    "an additional advantage to including @xmath2 here is that it appears to be stable with time for early - type galaxies over a significant range of redshift , as would be the case if large galaxies form their major core light at high redshift and then evolve later by inside - out growth mainly through minor mergers @xcite .",
    "the scale radius @xmath3 , by contrast , is expected to grow with time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "\\(3 ) the population size @xmath0 is only a simple first - order gauge of a gcs .",
    "other gcs characteristics that are of strong interest include the gcs _ radial profile _ , the gc _ luminosity distribution _ ( gclf ) , and the _ metallicity distribution _ ( mdf ) .",
    "the mdf in particular  in most cases measured through broadband color indices  has stimulated much ongoing discussion of the cluster formation process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) .",
    "many of the sources listed in our bibliography discuss these other characteristics , but a comprehensive analysis of them extends far beyond the goals of our present study .",
    "for each galaxy we have selected the studies that gave the best estimates of the total gc population , not necessarily the best analysis of the mdf or other characteristics .",
    "\\(4 ) it should be emphasized that the @xmath0 values collected here are of greatly differing internal uncertainty from one galaxy to the next and thus certainly do not make up a homogeneous list .",
    "ideally , @xmath0 should be determined from imaging that is both deep enough to reach nearly to the faint limit of the gclf , and also wide - field enough to cover the full radial extent of the gcs as well as to determine the background contamination level accurately .",
    "these twin conditions are rarely met .",
    "the most commonly used technique is to obtain gc photometry with a limiting magnitude near the `` turnover '' or peak point of the gclf and then fit a standard gaussian gclf shape to predict the total over all magnitudes . if ( as is usually the case ) the field coverage does not sample the entire halo of the target galaxy , then some outward extrapolation of the gcs radial profile beyond the heavily populated inner regions is also needed to estimate the total over all galactocentric radii .",
    "good recent examples of the standard techniques can be found , for example , in @xcite , p08 , @xcite , and references cited there . in all cases",
    "the gc population totals are simply the best attempts , with the available imaging data , to extrapolate over the full luminosity range and spatial range needed .",
    "inspection of the data catalog will show that the quoted relative uncertainties @xmath38 span a wide range : at best the population total is known to @xmath39% while at worst it may be uncertain by as much as a factor of two .",
    "we return to this point in the later discussion .",
    "\\(5 ) earlier gcs lists were dominated by large e galaxies with rich gc populations .",
    "the current catalog now reduces many sampling biasses : it includes the complete range of galaxy environment , type , and luminosity , from the smallest dwarfs to the largest supergiants .",
    "our catalog contains 248 ellipticals , 93 s0 s , and 81 spirals or irregulars .",
    "the smallest one in the list is the dsph kks-55 at @xmath40 holding a single gc , while the largest are cd / bcg supergiants with @xmath41 and holding up to 30,000 gcs each .",
    "\\(6 ) we note that for most galaxies in this catalog , we have used the single literature source that gives the best recent estimate of the total gc population .",
    "this may not correspond to the best sources for other purposes , such as discussions of the mdf . in some cases",
    "we have averaged the results from two or more sources that appear to give comparably good estimates of @xmath0 .",
    "lastly , in the catalog we have chosen _ not _ to list any galaxies for which the estimated @xmath0 was zero or negative .",
    "such cases include a few very small dwarfs @xcite for which @xmath42 after subtraction of field contamination ; or a few galaxies for which the imaging data simply did not reach deep enough to provide a sensible estimate of gc numbers @xcite .",
    "an exception is the local group elliptical m32 , which we include for historical reasons though it has no clearly identified clusters .",
    "using the entire database , we next explore some simple correlations of @xmath0 with large - scale host galaxy properties such as luminosity , dynamical mass , or scale size .",
    "the overall purpose is to use this new and larger dataset to search for _ reliable predictors of gc population size _ that can be calculated from the shortlist of simple structural parameters that are available for most of the galaxies . in doing so",
    ", we concentrate particularly on the ellipticals in the catalog , for two reasons : ( a ) they cover the largest range in luminosity , from dwarf - spheroidal up to cd supergiants ; and ( b ) they form the largest and most homogeneous subset of the gc measurements , making up almost 60% of the entire catalog .",
    "in general we take pairs of parameters ( x , y ) in log / log space and search for linear correlations of the normal form @xmath43 .",
    "assume that we have a sample of @xmath44 measured datapoints @xmath45 with quoted measurement uncertainties @xmath46 .",

    "@xmath48 is a suitable mean value over the the sample such that @xmath49 to minimize the covariance between @xmath50 .",
    "the parameters @xmath51 are constants that represent any additional variances in @xmath52",
    ". these variances might be due to intrinsic ( `` cosmic '' ) scatter built in to the sample population ; or extra measurement uncertainties if the quoted @xmath53 ) are underestimated ; or a combination of both effects . with only two pairs of measurements @xmath45 in the solution , and without any other external constraints , in general it will not be possible to solve independently for both of @xmath54 .",
    "therefore in practice for each solution described below , we set @xmath55 and vary @xmath56 until @xmath57 , the reduced @xmath58 per degree of freedom , equals 1 . in the discussion below",
    "we refer to @xmath56 determined from the solution as the _ residual dispersion _ for the dependent variable @xmath59 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "to set up several of the correlation solutions discussed later , we also calculate ( a ) the total visual luminosity @xmath60 with solar @xmath61 ; and ( b ) the dynamical mass , @xmath62 following @xcite .",
    "since the luminosity - weighted velocity dispersion is dominated by light from within @xmath3 , and the dark - matter halo contributes a small fraction of the mass within @xmath3 , @xmath34 is close to being the baryonic mass of the galactic bulge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dynamical mass can be calculated for 61% of the galaxies in our catalog , i.e. the ones with measurements of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    as a preliminary step and a check of our procedures , we show in figure [ lmass_3panel ] the direct correlation between @xmath34 and visual luminosity @xmath63 .",
    "the data are shown separately for the e , s0 , and spiral galaxies ( note that no dwarf irregulars are present here , since they lack any `` bulges '' from which a velocity dispersion can be measured ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that @xmath63 and @xmath34 are observationally nearly independent measurements except insofar as @xmath3 relies on knowing the large - scale light profile of the galaxy . for the e galaxies over their entire range ,",
    "the best - fit linear solution is listed in table 2 , along with the other correlations to be presented below . in the table ,",
    "the successive columns give ( 1 ) the pair of parameters ( x , y ) being fit , ( 2 ) the subsample of galaxy types used in the solution , ( 3 ) the number of galaxies in the solution , ( 4 - 6 ) the sample mean @xmath48 , zeropoint @xmath64 , and slope @xmath65 , ( 7 ) the best - fit residual dispersion @xmath56 , and ( 8) total rms scatter @xmath66 of the datapoints around the fitted solution . throughout table 2 , the luminosities @xmath63 and masses @xmath34 are in solar units",
    ".    the result @xmath67 corresponds to the well known systematic increase in mass - to - light ratio with galaxy size derived from the fundamental plane ( fp ) of early - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the measured scatter of @xmath70 dex rms in log @xmath34 about the best - fit line is also encouragingly small , given that the luminosity and calculated mass are derived from a wide variety of observational sources for @xmath71 , and @xmath3 and are unavoidably a somewhat heterogeneous sample .",

    ", we show all galaxy types together where an offset of 0.2 dex to the calculated mass has been applied to the s0 systems to bring them in line with the ellipticals , and an offset of 0.3 dex to the s / irr systems .    in figure [ irmass ]",
    "we show a similar correlation for the @xmath72band luminosity versus @xmath34 . plotting the three types of galaxies ( e ,",

    "we next plot total cluster population @xmath0 versus the other listed scaling parameters : @xmath63 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath34 .",
    "these are displayed in figures [ lum_3panel ] to [ mass_all ] , and selected best - fit solutions are listed in table 2 .",
    "comparison with the remaining quantity in the list , the smbh mass , is a special topic that has been the subject of discussion in several recent papers including @xcite ( hereafter s09 ) ; @xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "the most easily observable relation is between @xmath0 and the galaxy @xmath25 luminosity , which was also historically the first to be discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the data for all the systems in the current catalog are shown in figure [ lum_3panel ] . as has been found in all earlier discussions , @xmath0 increases very roughly in direct proportion to host galaxy luminosity , but",
    "obvious systematic deviations occur at both the high- and low - luminosity ends of the scale , and between e / s0 systems and s / irr ones .    in figure [ lumir_3panel ]",
    ", we show the correlations between @xmath0 and near - infrared luminosity @xmath37 .",
    "the pattern is very much the same , and the scatter quite similar to the previous figure .",
    "since the @xmath80 graph appears to give much the same information , and @xmath23 is available for a larger sample of galaxies , we stick primarily with the use of the visual - luminosity data in the following discussion .    the connection between galaxy size and gc population is most often presented in terms of the specific frequency @xcite , @xmath81 in the @xmath72band , if we adopt a typical color index @xmath82 for e galaxies and bulges ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the equivalent relation is @xmath83 the trend of @xmath4 versus @xmath23 is shown in figure [ sn ] , for the three subsets of data combined .",
    "the characteristic u - shaped distribution is the most prominent feature of the diagram : the intermediate - luminosity galaxies form a rather tight grouping in a `` valley '' around @xmath7 and the dwarfs and supergiants at opposite ends show much larger scatter and higher mean @xmath4 .",

    "this simple relation is not useful for late - type spiral or irregular galaxies where @xmath2 is not defined or not measurable . in those cases , a rough but still useful predictor of @xmath0 appears to be the effective radius @xmath3 alone , as seen in fig .",
    "[ resig_3panel ] ( lower left panel ) . for these types of galaxies ,",
    "we find @xmath99 ( listed in its log / log form in table 2 ) .",
    "the scatter in this case is @xmath100 dex in log @xmath0 , significantly higher than for the other relations presented above , and reflecting the intrinsically wide range of gc systems found in star - forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , it should be useful for giving first - order estimates if no other recourse is available .",
    "the total number of gcs in a galaxy is only a proxy for a more physically relevant quantity , the total stellar _ mass _ @xmath35 contained in all the gcs .",
    "ultimately , we would like to know the typical fraction of baryonic mass or total halo mass taken up by the gcs .",
    "here we use the `` specific mass '' defined as a percentage of the previously calculated dynamical mass of the host galaxy , @xmath101 this ratio should in principle be similar to the definition @xmath102 used by p08 , since as discussed above , @xmath34 is nearly equal to the total bulge stellar mass with minor contributions from either dark matter or gas ( except for major star - forming systems ) . by comparison , g10 use @xmath103 , which can be significantly different for either gas - rich dwarfs or cd - type systems with massive amounts of hot halo gas .",
    "perhaps more importantly however , our discussion of @xmath5 differs from those of p08 , s09 , or g10 in that they used _ photometrically estimated _ stellar masses @xmath104 versus our dynamical masses .    to define",
    "@xmath5 we need to add up the masses of the gcs in a given galaxy , or equivalently find the mean gc mass . for studies of gcss such as the virgo cluster survey ( peng et al . ) or ones in very nearby galaxies , it is possible to obtain a nearly complete census of all the clusters in a given galaxy and explicitly add them up one by one . for most of the galaxies in our catalog , however , we must adopt a more broad - brush procedure in hopes of identifying first - order trends .",
    "what helps considerably is the empirical fact that the gclf has a consistent , predictable shape across all galaxies , which conveniently allows us to scale @xmath0 to @xmath35 fairly straightforwardly .",
    "usually the gclf is represented by a simple gaussian in number of gcs per unit magnitude interval , @xmath105 , with a characteristic peak @xmath106 and standard deviation @xmath107 .",
    "more detailed analysis suggests that a slightly asymmetric form such as the `` evolved schechter function '' developed by @xcite is a better match to the data .",
    "however , this is only a minor concern because the total mass in the gcs is dominated by the clusters brighter than the peak ( turnover ) point of the gclf ; the clusters fainter than the turnover make up typically only @xmath108% of the total gcs mass .",
    "thus the normal gaussian - type analytical approximation where @xmath107 is determined by the bright half of the gclf remains quite useful .",
    "a more important consideration is that @xmath106 and @xmath107 depend on galaxy luminosity , in the sense that the gclf becomes broader and brighter for bigger galaxies . to integrate over the gclf",
    ", we follow the relations derived by @xcite and v10 , adopting @xmath109 and @xmath110 , where the zeropoints are normalized to the milky way .. inspection of the data from v10 shows that the deduced slope @xmath111 depends heavily on the more luminous galaxies , whereas for the dwarfs there is mainly a large scatter with no clear trend . ] finally , to convert gc luminosity to mass , we use a constant @xmath112 @xcite . and @xmath107 to calculate @xmath35 .",
    "] figure [ meanmass ] shows the resulting trend of mean individual gc mass versus galaxy mass @xmath34 ( where now @xmath113 ) .",
    "the residual scatter around this relation is simply the visible result of the galaxy - to - galaxy differences in the calculated @xmath114 for a given galaxy luminosity .",
    "this graph would be a dispersionless relation if , as in other papers , we had used galaxy _ luminosity _ to determine galaxy mass .",
    "the overall trend is listed in table 2 and shown in figure [ meanmass ] and is well matched by a single power law , @xmath115 in solar masses .    the correlation solution for gcs mass versus galaxy mass , for the e galaxies with @xmath116 ( table 2 ) , yields @xmath117 , slightly but significantly steeper than the @xmath118 dependence found earlier .",
    "the difference is a direct result of the second - order trend for mean gc mass to increase with host galaxy size . for the smaller e galaxies , the mean trend is @xmath119 , again quite similar to the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath34 .",
    "the plot of @xmath5 versus @xmath34 is shown in log / log form in figure [ sm ] .",
    "the overall distribution is roughly similar to that for @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ sn ] ) , though with less scatter at either the high - luminosity or low - luminosity ends .",
    "this reduced scatter is partly a result of our use of dynamical masses rather than photometric masses for the galaxies ( for example , two giant ellipticals may have the same luminosities , but if one of them is a cd - type or bcg , it will usually have a larger effective radius or central velocity dispersion and thus a higher dynamical mass ) .",
    "the practical penalty for using @xmath5 instead of @xmath4 is that we can not strictly include as many datapoints because we need to have both @xmath3 and @xmath2 to determine @xmath34 .",
    "we therefore supplement the dynamical data by adding in photometrically calculated masses from the known conversion between @xmath63 and @xmath34 , from eq .",
    "( 3 ) and table 2 .",
    "these secondary masses are added for the galaxies without measured @xmath3 and @xmath2 . as is evident in fig .",
    "[ sm ] , the extra points are particularly valuable for the lower - luminosity galaxies .",
    "we can gain some more understanding of why the relation shown in fig .",
    "[ genfit ] between cluster population and @xmath120 works by looking further at the scaling relations among galaxy mass , luminosity , size , and velocity dispersion . for the giant ellipticals ( @xmath121 ) , direct fits of each of @xmath3 and @xmath2 versus luminosity give @xmath122 and @xmath123 . combining these",
    "then predicts @xmath124 , using the other correlations in table 2 to translate from @xmath125 to @xmath34 and then to @xmath0 . inverting the result then gives @xmath126 , which closely matches what we obtain from the direct solution in fig .",
    "[ genfit ] and table 2 .",
    "the dwarf galaxies obey somewhat different scalings among size , dispersion , and luminosity , namely @xmath127 and @xmath128 . combining these leads to @xmath129 .",
    "however , this shallower trend is partly compensated by the shallower dependence of cluster population on mass for the dwarfs ( table 2 ) , @xmath130 .",
    "the luminosity range of the dwarf e s is small enough that they can accommodate a relatively wide range of slopes , permitting a single linear relation across the entire range from dwarf spheroidals to supergiants to be a workable representation .",
    "said differently , the gc population of a galaxy can be seen as another outcome of the fundamental plane for early - type galaxies .",
    ", it can be shown from the scalings between @xmath131 , and @xmath125 listed above that any pair of exponents where @xmath132 will work for both the giants and dwarfs . however , the combination @xmath133 has the strong advantage of simplicity and reproduces the actual data well . ]",
    "discussion of the specific frequency and specific mass @xmath4 and @xmath5 quickly leads to the question of gc formation efficiency  the original reason for defining these ratios .",
    "a summary of the thinking during the early ( pre-@xmath134cdm ) literature can be found in @xcite .",
    "a more recent view with growing evidence is that the gcs , which are compact stellar subsystems emerging from the densest and most massive sites of star formation , could be the objects that form earliest in any starburst , followed by the bulk of the field stars and the lower - mass star clusters that soon dissolve into the field .",
    "first ideas along these lines were explored by @xcite , and @xcite , pointing to the possibility of a universal gc formation efficiency _ per unit",
    "baryonic mass _ including both stars and gas .",
    "if the later rounds of star formation _ after _ gc formation are truncated or severely reduced by any combination of external or internal quenching , then the resulting @xmath4 or @xmath5 observed long after the fact is a marker of how well the quenching worked .",
    "high@xmath135 systems thus would be _ field - star deficient _",
    "( not `` cluster - rich '' ) because the star formation was prevented from running to completion .",
    "this interpretation has been developed further by p08 , g10 , and @xcite ; in particular , p08 estimate quantitatively that in dwarf galaxies the peak star formation epoch lagged the peak gc formation epoch by @xmath136 myr .",
    "different mechanisms for shutting down star formation will operate at the opposite extremes of the galaxy mass range .",
    "for the dwarfs with their small potential wells , internally driven feedback including starburst winds , photoionization , and ultimately sne may eject a large fraction of the gas , while external quenching from tidal stripping of gas or external uv fields can also reduce the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) .",
    "for the most massive galaxies , agn feedback and virial shock heating of infalling gas will lower the sfe @xcite .",
    "the maximum sfe should then happen for intermediate - mass galaxies which are massive enough to hold their star - forming gas against sn and starburst winds , but in which agn feedback or shock heating are not intense enough to have much effect .",
    "much recent literature has addressed this issue by tracing the change in the ratio @xmath137 versus galaxy size , which displays the same u - shaped distribution that we see in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 curves . to mention only two recent studies , @xcite",
    "identify sfe(max ) at a stellar mass @xmath138 or @xmath139 , while from a combination of direct stellar mass and halo mass observational determinations @xcite find the sfe maximum to be at @xmath140 .",
    "viewed in this light , the _ minimum _ of the @xmath5 or @xmath4 distributions becomes perhaps the most interesting region of those diagrams .",
    "the baseline ratios @xmath7 and @xmath141 essentially tell us , _ in the galaxies where star formation was globally the most efficient _ , what mass fraction went into the dense compact systems that we _ now _ see surviving as globular clusters .",
    "that is , _ these baseline values reveal what the `` natural '' gc formation efficiency is when any disruption or quenching of star formation is at its least important .",
    "_    this present - day mass fraction is , however , only a lower limit to the value at the time of formation , because ( a ) many low - mass or low - density star clusters are disrupted or dissolved over the subsequent hubble time , and ( b ) even the surviving ones that started as the densest , most massive clumps have lost a large fraction of their initial mass through a combination of early rapid mass loss ( expulsion of residual gas , and sne and stellar winds from massive stars ) and later dynamical erosion .",
    "the current literature @xcite indicates that the individual globular clusters that have survived to the present should have been @xmath142 10 times more massive when they were protoclusters than they are now .",
    "the conclusion we draw from these arguments is that the surviving gcs represented at least 1 percent of the star formation mass fraction in the maximally efficient intermediate - mass galaxies . in either dwarf or supergiant galaxies , however ,",
    "where @xmath5 may be an order of magnitude higher , the gcs we see today could  as protoclusters  have taken as much as 10% of the gas that successfully formed stars . and",
    "these mass fractions must only be lower limits to the amounts of star - forming gas that went into young star clusters , after accounting for the clusters that did not survive to the present .",
    "the interpretation that @xmath35 is driven by the amount of gas mass initially present in the galaxy s potential well ( and not the gas mass that was actually consumed in star formation ) then raises the possibility that @xmath35 should be more nearly proportional to @xmath9 , or the total depth of the galaxy potential well .",
    "this direction has been explored by @xcite , p08 , s09 , and g10 . following the notation of g10 , we denote @xmath143 . for the dwarf galaxies in particular ( discussed at greater length by p08 and g10 ) , our derivation that @xmath119 is in excellent agreement with the scaling @xmath144 obtained by @xcite if we assume that @xmath145 and also @xmath146 as above .    to derive the `` absolute '' gc formation efficiency parameter @xmath147 from our new sample of galaxies",
    ", we need to adopt a stellar - to - halo mass conversion relation @xmath148 , or else its inverse . by hypothesis",
    "we also simply use @xmath146 and @xmath149 as mentioned above .",
    "these steps then directly link @xmath9 to @xmath35 and @xmath104 , and the assumed value of @xmath147 can be varied until a match is achieved with our data .",
    "our specific approach is to fix @xmath147 by requiring the resulting @xmath5 vs.  @xmath104 curve to pass through the baseline @xmath141 for the intermediate - mass galaxies .",
    "one such conversion between @xmath104 and @xmath9 is given by @xcite and @xcite , derived from a combination of methods for measuring @xmath9 and @xmath104 over a wide range of luminosity regimes ( see eq .",
    "24 from behroozi or eq .  13 from leauthaud ) .",
    "their empirical model shows a clear rise in the ratio @xmath150 at the low - mass and high - mass ends with a minimum at intermediate galaxies .",
    "however , their model function and parameters give a curve for @xmath5 that is too steep at each end to be satisfactory in detail for our purposes .",
    "a flexible and simpler conversion relation from @xcite and also used by s09 is @xmath151 to use this , we assume a value for @xmath9 , which determines @xmath104 ( which by hypothesis equals our @xmath34 ) .",
    "finally @xmath152 , which then defines a point on fig .",
    "[ sm ] . repeating for a wide range of @xmath9 then defines a complete @xmath5 vs. @xmath34 curve .",
    "an illustrative fit of this model to the gcs data is shown as the solid curve in fig .",
    "this curve uses the parameters @xmath153 , log @xmath154 = 9.98 , and log @xmath155 = 10.7 along with exponents @xmath156 . ) , and the values we find to give a good fit are slightly different from the ones used by s09 .",
    "again , they used a different , simpler prescription for @xmath157 and thus @xmath35 ; a smaller gcs dataset ; and a different prescription for computing galaxy masses . ] at either the low - mass or high - mass end of the scale ,",
    "the @xmath5 curve asymptotically approaches a simple power law . at the high - mass end , where @xmath158 becomes large , it can quickly be shown that @xmath159 , which for our fitted value @xmath160 gives @xmath161 . at the low - mass end where @xmath158 is small , then @xmath162 , which for @xmath163 gives @xmath164 .",
    "our estimated @xmath165 represents the absolute efficiency of gc formation . by comparison , through different combinations of methods for deriving the various masses and luminosities , g10 find a mean @xmath166 , while s09 find @xmath167 .",
    "the agreement among these discussions is well within the scatter we can expect given the different assumptions for the definition of @xmath5 and the methods for finding galaxy luminosities , stellar masses , and dark - halo masses .",
    "we have suggested in the discussion above that the galaxy mass where @xmath5 reaches a minimum represents the level where star formation efficiency was the highest .",
    "the @xmath5 interpolation curve in fig .  [ sm ] reaches a minimum at @xmath168 . within the accuracy permitted by the scatter around the curve ,",
    "this minimum point is strikingly similar to the galaxy - based estimates of @xmath169 mentioned above for the point of maximum sfe , and emerges from quite a different line of argument .",
    "yet another piece of information in line with these results is recent evidence @xcite that the maximum _ metallicity gradient _ within galaxies occurs near @xmath170 , as would be the case for galaxies that have had minimal influences from mergers and feedback during their primary star - forming stages .",
    "along with the gcs catalog itself , we view fig .",
    "[ sm ] and the discussion above as the most important result of this paper .",
    "the relative number of globular clusters in a galaxy as measured by either @xmath4 or @xmath5 differs considerably from one system to another , but still follows a systematic trend that can be matched by a single , constant ratio @xmath171 .",
    "our results strongly support recent work ( s09 , g10 ) that the globular cluster system is a remarkably simple proxy for the most fundamental characteristic of a galaxy , namely its dark - matter potential well .",
    "the hypothesis @xmath145 can explain the basic shape of the @xmath5 distribution with its characteristic rise at extreme low and high luminosities , but it does not address the _ scatter _ that we see in any given mass range .",
    "quantitatively this scatter is @xmath172 dex at any point on the mean curve , or slightly less than a factor of two in @xmath5 .",
    "we should expect four generic sources of scatter :    * random measurement uncertainties in @xmath0 and thus @xmath35 . the raw uncertainties or even the statistical variance in @xmath0 , as discussed above , may be up to factors of 2 depending on the galaxy and are therefore probably the dominant source of the observed scatter . * random uncertainties in the quantities that determine @xmath34 , namely @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "these behave differently from random scatter in @xmath0 , since @xmath173 , and thus @xmath5 and @xmath34 are not independent quantities .",
    "any error in @xmath34 would generate an equal , inverse change in @xmath5 and would shift points along a diagonal line in fig .",
    "[ sm ] . if this was , however , an important source of the observed scatter then it should be most visible at the high - mass end where the @xmath5 curve is nearly perpendicular to that error line . in practice",
    "we see rather similar amounts of scatter over a wide range of masses , consistent with the expectation from the raw observations that @xmath3 and @xmath2 are uncertain to @xmath174% ( see * ? ? ? * ) . * intrinsic differences in gc formation efficiency between galaxies of similar type and mass .",
    "these differences certainly exist ( compare the classic well - studied cases of the virgo giants m87 and m49 , which have similar luminosities but gc populations different by almost a factor of 3 ) , but it is harder to make any general statements about the amount of such `` cosmic scatter '' at this stage .",
    "a large part of the scatter may be the result of environment : for example , p08 address this question in detail for dwarfs , and find evidence that de galaxies near dominant giants are more likely to have higher@xmath135 gcss . by hypothesis",
    "these galaxies may have benefitted from being in deeper halo potential wells which increased massive star cluster formation . at the opposite end of the environment scale",
    ", @xcite find that e galaxies in very isolated environments have quite low specific frequencies in the range normally associated with spirals or s0 s .",
    "* the stochastic effects of different individual merging and star - forming histories , which are hard to recover in full detail long after the fact .",
    "these must also play a role in generating galaxy - to - galaxy differences .",
    "conversely , differences in dynamical gc destruction interior to a galaxy should not be a major factor , since internal gc erosion rates should be similar _ for galaxies of the same type and luminosity_. going further into these intriguing questions is beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "lastly , although some dwarfs and supergiants stand out as having exceptionally high @xmath5 , it is perhaps worth noting as well that many dwarfs and giants have @xmath5 or @xmath4 values that are quite similar to those of the intermediate - luminosity galaxies in the `` baseline '' middle range .",
    "the large size of our new catalog allows this feature of the distribution to stand out more clearly than before .",
    "quantitatively , fully 80% of the _ entire _ sample in fig .",
    "[ sm ] falls within @xmath175 ( below the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ sm ] ) , and 64% fall within @xmath176 .",
    "the median of the whole sample ( less sensitive to outliers than the mean ) is at @xmath177 . in terms of specific frequency",
    ", 64% of the entire catalog falls below @xmath178 and the median is at @xmath179 .",
    "it seems that no single starting point for gc formation may work equally well for every galaxy .",
    "if gcs form extremely early and the later field - star formation is quenched or disrupted , then the result will be a cluster - rich galaxy .",
    "contrarily , if there is little difference between gc formation times and field - star formation times , then a lower@xmath135 gc system will result .",
    "therefore we suggest that the many dwarfs and giants with lower specific frequencies could be ones in which the gc and field - star formation rates versus time were the same as in the intermediate galaxies .    a next step in understandng",
    "the link between gc formation and their host galaxies will be to explore more thoroughly the relation with cluster metallicity ( color ) : what does the correlation of @xmath5 versus galaxy mass look like for the red and blue gc subgroups ?",
    "another major question is the role of galaxy environment , and how much of the scatter around the @xmath5 and @xmath4 relations is driven by a galaxy s location .",
    "initial work on these questions has started , but extensions to much bigger samples will be valuable .",
    "we summarize the results of our discussion as follows :    * a new catalog of 422 galaxies with published measurements of their globular cluster systems is presented along with a source bibliography .",
    "this list , based on a literature survey to the end of 2012 , contains 248 ellipticals ( dwarfs and giants ) , 93 s0 s , and 81 spirals and irregulars . *",
    "total gc population @xmath0 increases monotonically with either host galaxy luminosity or baryonic mass , but not in a simple linear way . in agreement with other recent studies but now based on a larger sample , we find that the gc specific frequency and specific mass follow a u - shaped trend , with very high @xmath4 at either very low or very high luminosity , but reaching a well defined mean value @xmath180 and @xmath8 in the range @xmath181 . this trend can be understood as the result of the different kinds of feedback operating during galaxy formation : for the low - mass dwarfs , field - star formation is inhibited by radiative feedback , gas ejection , and externally driven damping before it can run to completion ; while for giants , early agn activity and virial heating inhibit field - star formation after the gcs have formed . at intermediate galaxy mass ,",
    "neither kind of feedback is as important and so these galaxies can form stars the most efficiently . thus along with p08 , g10 we identify these minimum @xmath182 values as the _ baseline normal _ for star formation minimally damped by feedback or external quenching . *",
    "galaxies such as the extreme dwarfs or supergiants may be ones in which the gc formation epoch preceded the bulk of field - star formation and was therefore less affected by feedback and quenching processes . * previous recent studies including @xcite have explored the proposal that gc population size ( or more importantly , the mass @xmath35 ) is directly proportional to the host galaxy halo mass @xmath9 .",
    "our work adds support to this interpretation .",
    "we find that a single constant ratio @xmath183 is capable of reproducing the systematic trend of specific mass @xmath5 versus galaxy mass , over the entire range of galaxy sizes and masses .",
    "the galaxy - to - galaxy scatter anywhere around this relation is typically a factor of two .",
    "* we find that gc population size can also be accurately predicted by a simple product of galaxy effective radius and velocity dispersion , as @xmath11 .",
    "the residual scatter is @xmath184 dex , making it competitive with any other proposed correlation .",
    "we show that this relation can be roughly understood from previously known fundamental plane scaling relations among galaxy luminosity , mass , and scale size .",

    "<S> we present a catalog of 422 galaxies with published measurements of their globular cluster ( gc ) populations . of these , 248 are e galaxies , 93 are s0 galaxies , and 81 are spirals or irregulars . among various correlations of the total number of gcs with other global galaxy properties , we find that @xmath0 correlates well though nonlinearly with the dynamical mass of the galaxy bulge @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the central velocity dispersion and @xmath3 the effective radius of the galaxy light profile </S>",
    "<S> . we also present updated versions of the gc specific frequency @xmath4 and specific mass @xmath5 versus host galaxy luminosity and baryonic mass . </S>",
    "<S> these graphs exhibit the previously known u - shape : highest @xmath4 or @xmath5 values occur for either dwarfs or supergiants , but in the midrange of galaxy size ( @xmath6 ) the gc numbers fall along a well defined baseline value of @xmath7 or @xmath8 , similar among all galaxy types . </S>",
    "<S> along with other recent discussions , we suggest that this trend may represent the effects of feedback , which systematically inhibited early star formation at either very low or very high galaxy mass , but which had its minimum effect for intermediate masses . </S>",
    "<S> our results strongly reinforce recent proposals that gc formation efficiency appears to be most nearly proportional to the galaxy halo mass @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean `` absolute '' efficiency ratio for gc formation that we derive from the catalog data is @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the galaxy - to - galaxy scatter around this mean value may arise in part because of differences in the relative timing of gc formation versus field - star formation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that an excellent empirical predictor of total gc population for galaxies of all luminosities is @xmath11 , a result consistent with fundamental plane scaling relations . </S>"
