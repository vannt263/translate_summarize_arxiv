    "the development of new methods for efficiently separating charged biopolymers by length has been an area of significant recent activity due to the fact that strategies for genome sequencing are based on sorting dna fragments by size @xcite .",
    "simple charge - based sorting is not possible because the increase in electrostatic force on longer molecules with greater total charge is exactly offset by a corresponding increase in hydrodynamic drag @xcite . instead",
    ", separation is achieved using techniques such as gel electrophoresis , in which longer molecules are slowed relative to shorter ones due to interactions with cross links in the gel .",
    "gel and capillary electrophoretic techniques are limited to dna strands less than @xmath0 base pairs ( bp ) in length @xcite ; the mobility saturates for longer strands , and sufficiently large strands fail to pass through the gel at all .",
    "there is a need for separation of strands up to @xmath1 bp , and thus new techniques which can sort longer molecules are of particular interest @xcite .",
    "the motion of elastic strings through random media is also of general interest for a wide range of systems including magnetic domain wall motion , vortex lattice motion in superconductors , and charge density waves .",
    "several recent proposals for electrophoretic techniques move away from the traditional media of gels and polymers and instead take advantage of advances in nanolithography to create microstructured devices for separation @xcite .",
    "the sorting effectiveness of these techniques is limited by the relative size of the nanofabricated structure and the polymers to be sorted , making it necessary to fabricate a separate device for each size range of interest .",
    "in contrast , seo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed an adsorption - based separation technique that could permit the sorting of polymers which vary in size by three orders of magnitude . when the ionic strength of the buffer solution is altered @xcite , the dna is partially adsorbed onto a clean surface , forming a series of loops which extend into the solution and trains which are adsorbed on the substrate .",
    "it has been proposed that separation occurs because the longer polymers have a larger number of train segments , and thus experience a greater retardation of their motion @xcite .    the quasi - two dimensional geometry considered in ref .",
    "@xcite is very appealing for separation purposes , in part because adsorbed polymers spread out significantly into flat ` pancakes ' @xcite compared to their coiled three - dimensional configurations , permitting better coupling to length differences . the sorting mechanism in ref .",
    "@xcite precludes complete adsorption , however , since there is no separation for fully desorbed or fully adsorbed polymers .",
    "this limits the length range that can be processed , since if the surface is strongly attractive to dna , long dna chains fully adsorb and separation by length is lost .",
    "if instead the surface weakly attracts dna , short chains desorb from the surface and can not be separated @xcite .    here",
    "we propose an alternative sorting technique for long dna strands in which the polymers are fully adsorbed on the surface . to permit separation ,",
    "we spatially modify the surface , but instead of of using posts or other impenetrable barriers , we consider randomly spaced pinning sites which temporarily retard the motion of the polymer , yet still allow it to pass through .",
    "such pinning could be created via the manipulation of lipid bilayer membranes @xcite or surface patterning @xcite .",
    "we show that in this geometry , longer polymers are more mobile than shorter ones , in contrast to typical separation methods where longer polymers move more slowly .",
    "this avoids the jamming or clogging associated with long polymers in other techniques .",
    "the steric interaction between polymer segments causes the longer polymers to be less well pinned by the random disorder than the short polymers , and allows separation by length to occur .    to demonstrate our separation mechanism",
    ", we use a simulation model that we have developed for long dna fragments .",
    "many of the existing simulation models for electrophoretic processes are best suited for shorter polymers @xcite .",
    "since we are concerned with polymers up to 300 @xmath2 m in length , we do not attempt to simulate each atom in the polymer . instead , we adopt a bead - spring model in which the polymer is represented by multiple beads @xcite which are each spaced many persistence lengths apart .",
    "there is an entropic resistance to the stretching of the polymer segment between two beads , which is represented by a finitely extensible nonlinear spring ( fene ) potential @xcite that replaces the internal degrees of freedom of the polymer molecule @xcite .",
    "an essential assumption of this model is that the polymer segment between beads is significantly longer than the polymer persistence length .",
    "this is in contrast to bead - stick models @xcite , where the distance between beads is ten or less actual chemical segments .",

    "the persistence length @xmath21 of double - stranded dna is @xmath22 @xcite . the kuhn length @xmath23 , giving @xmath24 m , where we assume that the ionic strength of the buffer solution is sufficient to screen electrostatic repulsion between sections of the chain @xcite .",
    "each base pair is 0.34 nm long so one kuhn length contains 300 bp @xcite . since we will be using a gaussian chain model for the excluded volume interactions , which requires the chain segments between beads to be represented statistically and not deterministically ,",

    "( 4 ) since thermal effects do not play a significant role in the separation technique , thermal broadening of the bands by diffusion should be strongly suppressed .",
