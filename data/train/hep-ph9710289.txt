    "the flavour oscillations of particles are a fascinating demonstration of quantum mechanics in the macroscopic world .",
    "flavour oscillations can generically occur when the states which are produced and detected in a given experiment are superpositions of two or more eigenstates which have different masses .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons have been observed experimentally  @xcite and have been used to place stringent constraints on physics beyond the standard model .",
    "if neutrinos are massive , they too may oscillate , and this could lead to the resolution of the well - known solar neutrino problem  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the discussion of particle oscillations has been extended to include supersymmetric particles in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of particle oscillations has been studied extensively and is generally thought to be very well understood .",
    "there nevertheless remain several subtle issues which continue to cause some confusion .",
    "the key to a complete understanding of any such issue lays in treating correctly the necessary interplay between the `` classical '' and `` quantum '' natures of the particles which are interfering to produce the oscillations .",
    "thus , for example , the interference effect itself is purely `` quantum '' in nature ( it requires that the particles be described by waves ) , and yet the resulting oscillations in space are only observable if the particles are sufficiently localized in space  @xcite .",
    "this example highlights the fact that any discussion of particle oscillations implicitly assumes that the mass eigenstates which are interfering to produce the oscillations are described by some sort of wave packets .    despite the success of the wave packet approach in clarifying many aspects of the phenomenon of particle oscillations  @xcite ,",
    "the approach is not without its own difficulties .",
    "the results of a given calculation will depend , for example , on the details of the initial mass eigenstate wave packets ( including their shape , spectrum and relative normalization ) .",
    "one particularly difficult problem which arises is the conversion of the final time - evolved wave packets into an experimentally observable quantity : since it is generally the * flux * of particles which is measured in an experiment , one is required to calculate a current density rather than a probability density .",
    "the difference between a current density and a probability density , at least naively , involves a factor of the velocity @xmath2 , which is very significant if the mass eigenstates have quite different masses .",
    "thus , if one would calculate the probability density at the detector and integrate it over time , the resulting expression would have factors of @xmath3 pre - multiplying the various terms , leading to an enhancement of the terms corresponding to heavier mass eigenstates . in the case of neutrinos , as was noted in  @xcite , this would skew the usual oscillation formula quite dramatically if one of the mass eigenstate neutrinos was non - relativistic .",
    "efforts to construct an appropriate current density which retains the necessary wave packet features have had mixed success .",
    "a calculation in the kaon case appears to give reliable results  @xcite , but it can be shown that unphysical effects arise if one attempts to define a suitable current when the mass eigenstates have very different masses  @xcite .",
    "there is another very striking apparent `` ambiguity '' which arises if one does not treat the delicate interplay between the classical and quantum natures of the particles correctly . in this case",
    "the `` ambiguity '' leads to an alleged error by a factor of `` 2 '' in the calculation of the oscillation length  @xcite . in order to understand the source of the ambiguity , we follow the discussion given by lipkin",
    "suppose we consider the oscillations in time of a system for which the initial and final states are not eigenstates of the free hamiltonian .",
    "the phase of the interference term will then be given by @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 , where @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "detectors do not measure oscillations directly as a function of time , however , so one needs somehow to convert this expression into an oscillation in terms of space .",
    "we may then , as is conventionally done , set @xmath10@xmath5@xmath11 , with @xmath2@xmath5@xmath12 representing a sort of average velocity .",
    "we then obtain the following phase in terms of @xmath10 , _",
    "conv(x ) = .",
    "[ eq : phaseconv ] this is the conventional ( and correct ) result for the phase difference .",
    "let us now attempt to incorporate a classical aspect of the problem and argue that since the two mass eigenstates travel at different speeds , they will arrive at the detector at _ different _ times @xmath13 and @xmath14 , related by @xmath10@xmath5@xmath15@xmath5@xmath16 .",
    "taking the phase of the interference term to be @xmath17@xmath5@xmath18 , we then obtain _",
    "new(x ) = , [ eq : phasenew ] which differs from the conventional phase difference , eq .",
    "( [ eq : phaseconv ] ) , by a factor of two .",
    "this result , were it correct , would indeed be rather remarkable .",
    "the first resolution of this ambiguity was given by lipkin  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) who argued , on physical grounds , that the energies ( rather than the momenta ) of the two mass eigenstates should be set equal . in this case",
    "the oscillations are described in terms of distances directly ( since it is the momenta of the two eigenstates which differ ) and the `` correct '' oscillation formula is obtained . lowe _",
    "et al _  @xcite and kayser  @xcite have extended this discussion and have argued that the key to avoiding ambiguities is to ensure that one evaluates the wave functions of the mass eigenstates at precisely the same space - time point .",
    "that is , even though classically the mass eigenstates will arrive at the detector at different times , quantum mechanically the wave functions corresponding to different space - time points can not interfere . indeed the analysis leading to the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phasenew ] ) involves interfering the wave functions for the two mass eigenstates at the same position but _ different _ times and hence gives the incorrect result .",
    "this issue is , in fact , quite subtle .",
    "for example a long coherent measurement in time may be used to `` revive '' particle oscillations even after the mass eigenstate wave packets have completely separated spatially  @xcite .",
    "oscillator gets hit by two successive pulses .",
    "the first pulse sets the oscillator in motion , causing it to oscillate for a time determined by its @xmath19 value .",
    "if the oscillator is still oscillating when the second pulse arrives , the resulting oscillations will exhibit an interference pattern .",
    "] thus , wave packets arriving at the `` classically '' separated times @xmath13 and @xmath14  and having negligible overlap in their wave packets  may still interfere to give rise to oscillations .",
    "there is then some sense in which wave functions corresponding to different space - time points may interfere .    in light of the issues",
    "presented above , it is our view that a proper treatment of the quantum ",
    "classical interface of particle oscillations should incorportate the source and the detector as key components of the system . in this paper",
    "we present a simple model for a particle source - detector system which addresses many of the above issues in a very natural and self - consistent way .",
    "we shall , for concreteness , consider the case of neutrino oscillations , but our approach could easily be adapted to other situations .",
    "the source and detector will be modeled by simple harmonic oscillators which are de - excited or excited by emitting or absorbing neutrinos of a given flavour .",
    "( two - level `` fermionic '' source  detector systems could also be considered . )",
    "having defined the model , it will be straightforward to calculate the oscillation probability as a function of the distance between the source and detector .",
    "the resulting expressions will be found to exhibit all of the known `` wave packet '' characteristics in the relativistic limit , but will also give useful insight into cases in which one or more of the mass eigenstates is non - relativistic .",
    "in particular , we will find no evidence for the enhancement of non - relativistic neutrinos which can occur in conventional wave packet analyses .",
    "including the source explicitly in the calculation gives the added benefit that the characteristics of the initial wave packets corresponding to the various mass eigenstates are completely determined by the characteristics of the source and need not be put in by hand .",
    "our approach is similar in spirit to the calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite , but is more transparent due to the simplified model which we consider .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar calculation performed within the context of elementary quantum mechanics . )",
    "one advantage of our simplified approach is that the dependence on the time - resolution of the detector is very clear .",
    "this will allow us to verify explicitly that a long coherent measurement in time may be used to revive the oscillations of particles whose wave packets have separated spatially .",
    "we shall also settle the issue of the `` factor of 2 '' ( hopefully ) once and for all .",
    "we begin in the next section by analyzing a simple model in which the neutrino is described by a complex scalar field .",
    "this field is coupled to two localized simple harmonic oscillators , representing the source and detector .",
    "modeling the neutrino by a complex scalar field allows for a simpler and more complete evaluation of physical quantities than if a spinor field is used . in sec .",
    "[ asingleneut ] we study the case of a single neutrino species coupled to the source and detector .",
    "this allows for a careful analysis of the efficiency of our system at producing and detecting neutrinos of different masses .",
    "although no oscillations are possible in this case , this calculation will be essential in interpreting the results when neutrino oscillations are present . in sec .",
    "[ sevneut ] we couple several neutrino fields to the source and detector .",
    "this gives rise in a natural way to oscillations ( as a function of the distance between the source and detector ) in the probability for the source to decay and the detector to be excited .",
    "these are of course `` neutrino oscillations . ''",
    "[ sec : nonrelcase ] contains a brief analysis of the non - relativistic case .",
    "we then extend our analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec3.3 ] to a more realistic model in which the neutrinos are described by dirac spinor fields .",
    "these results are compared to the ones with a complex scalar field .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec3.4 ] with a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "the idea of using an idealized detector to clarify physically measurable quantities in quantum field theory has been used extensively in the analysis of quantum fields in non - inertial frames and in gravitational backgrounds  @xcite . in our idealized model , we have chosen to couple the neutrino field to two harmonic oscillators , one representing a neutrino `` source , '' and the other representing a neutrino `` detector .

    "the neutrinos are first taken to be complex scalar fields which simplifies the calculations considerably .",
    "nature of neutrino interactions . ]",
    "the physical picture which we have in mind is the following : we imagine our `` source '' and `` detector '' to be microscopic on the scale of some macroscopic `` bulk '' source and detector , but to also be very massive compared to the energy of the exchanged neutrino ( so that the dynamical degrees of freedom of the source and detector may be ignored ) .",
    "thus , for example , the source ( detector ) could represent some nucleus inside a bulk sample which undergoes beta decay ( inverse beta decay ) .",
    "the spatial `` widths '' of the source and detector in our calculation are then widths appropriate to , say , nuclear or atomic dimensions . in principle , the oscillation probability which we calculate here should subsequently be averaged incoherently over the physical dimensions of the macroscopic source and detector , although we do not perform this average .",
    "if the size of the macroscopic source and detector are much smaller than the neutrino oscillation length ( which they need to be in order to observe oscillations ) , then this averaging would have only a small effect .",
    "the interactions at the source and detector will be made explicitly time dependent so that they may be turned `` on '' and `` off . ''",
    "this is in keeping with our physical picture . in general",
    "a real ( microscopic ) source or detector will be in an environment which is `` noisy , '' so that the coherent emission or absorption of a neutrino gets cut off after some time due to the interactions of the source or detector with its surrounding environment  @xcite .",
    "the amount of time which the model source or detector spend being `` on '' is then related to the `` coherence time '' of the physical source or detector .",
    "our calculation proceeds as follows .",
    "we first write a lagrangian which couples the source and detector to the neutrino field . in the initial state of the system ,",
    "the source is in its first excited state ( ready to emit a neutrino ) and the detector is in its ground state .",
    "we then calculate the probability that at some time far in the future the source is found to be in its ground state and the detector in its first excited state .",
    "the model will be constructed in such a way that this interaction will correspond to exactly one neutrino being exchanged between the source and detector ( to first non - vanishing order in perturbation theory . ) in this approach , then , the neutrinos themselves are not observed , but are simply the exchange particles in the source - detector interaction .      to describe our model , we begin with a single complex scalar field @xmath20 and two oscillators @xmath21 and @xmath22 describing the source and detector , respectively . the action for our model is given by s = d^4x ( l_^0 + l_int ) + dt l_q^0 , [ toyaction ] where @xmath23 the functions @xmath24 are explicit functions of time which allow us to `` turn on '' and `` turn off '' the interactions , and the functions @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) are smooth functions of @xmath27 which vanish outside the source ( detector ) .",

    "a second observation is that conservation of energy at the source and of momentum at both the source and detector are governed by the relative sizes of @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "this latter point is due to the fact that our souce and detector have no dynamical degrees of freedom  they can not recoil when a neutrino is emitted or absorbed  and thus the neutrino gets all of its momentum from the uncertainties in the positions of the source and detector . in order to avoid the problem that low momenta are favoured",

    "it becomes possible to also produce lepton pairs with positive helicity .",
    "the quantities which will occur in the oscillation probability are the squares of the matrix elements .",
    "let us define @xmath173 then @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) gives some measure of the probability that the source / detector interaction gives rise to two leptons with positive ( negative ) helicity .",
    "since the efficiency of the system at producing and detecting neutrinos of a given mass is determined to some extent by the functions @xmath176 , it is useful to plot them as a function of the mass of the exchanged neutrino .",

    "[ matrixsq.fg ] shows a plot of @xmath180 and @xmath181 as a function of the neutrino mass .",
    "the `` threshold '' in this case is determined by the condition @xmath61@xmath5@xmath182 , where @xmath70 is the neutrino mass .",
    "the upper curve corresponds to the negative helicity case and approaches unity as @xmath70@xmath101@xmath65 .",
    "the lower curve disappears in the same limit . for neutrino masses closer to threshold , fairly substantial deviations from the @xmath70@xmath5@xmath65 case",
    "are observed to occur .    the plot in fig .",
    "[ matrixsq.fg ] should of course be treated with some caution , since it shows only the square of the matrix element evaluated at some `` optimal '' energy and momentum configuration . in general , the oscillation probability will also receive contributions due to energy and momentum configurations which are non - optimal .",
    "furthermore , it has been found that the procedure which we have followed can lead to non - sensical results if the neutrino mass is taken to be large compared to the lepton mass . and @xmath183 need not be the same . for very heavy neutrinos",
    "this starts to cause problems in this approach . ] in any case , however , the plot _ does _ demonstrate something which might be regarded as `` typical '' : for non - relativistic neutrinos there will be a non - zero probability to produce charged leptons in the final state which have the `` wrong '' helicity configurations .",
    "thus , particularly if the spin of the leptons were to be measured in a certain experiment , one could expect there to be quite strong mass effects for non - relativistic neutrinos . in our case , for example , there is a suppression of the negative helicity final states for large mass and a mild enhancement of the positive helicity ones .",
    "since in this model the neutrinos no longer have their momenta centered about the ( unphysical ) value of `` zero , '' one would expect in this case that the non - relativistic neutrinos would not be favoured , as was found to be the case in the bosonic model studied above .",
    "in fact , it is possible that there would be a suppression for non - relativistic neutrinos due to the phase space suppression of the final state leptons , for small momenta .",
    "this question could really only be answered by performing a thorough numerical analysis of the model , which we shall not do at this time .",
    "most phenomenological work in the field of particle ( @xmath184 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , ... ) oscillations describes the oscillations as a function of time and then converts the time dependence of the results to a space dependence .",
    "there have been many attempts in the literature to improve on these calculations by explicitly including the spatial dependence of the wave function .",
    "these approaches have necessarily lead to the description of the wave function as a wave packet .",
    "it has been shown that several recent claims that such wave packet approaches lead to different results than the simple time ",
    "oscillation approach , are incorrect and that a _ proper _ wave packet calculation leads to the `` expected '' results .    in this paper",
    "we have presented a novel approach to the study of the spatial dependence of neutrino ( and other particle ) oscillations .",
    "we have done this by coupling the neutrino field to an idealized , localized model of a source and detector which we have chosen to describe as simple harmonic oscillators which can be excited or de - excited by the absorption or emission of a neutrino .",
    "the system begins with the source in the first excited state and the detector in its ground state .",
    "we then compute the probability that at a much later time the source is in its ground state ( so that it has emitted a neutrino ) and the detector is in its first excited state ( so that it has absorbed a neutrino ) . this probability is evaluated as a function of the distance between the source and the detector and it depends , in detail , on the spatial extent of the source and the detector as well as on the length of time for which each is on .",
    "we have seen how to use this dependence to obtain a better understanding of how neutrino oscillations depend on the time resolution and the coherence properties of the source and the detector .",
    "we have also seen how our approach is useful in clarifying several subtle issues related to the quantum mechanics of neutrino oscillations .",
