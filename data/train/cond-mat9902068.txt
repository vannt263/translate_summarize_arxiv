    "<S> we study a stochastic multiplicative process with reset events . it is shown that the model develops a stationary power - law probability distribution for the relevant variable , whose exponent depends on the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> two qualitatively different regimes are observed , corresponding to intermittent and regular behaviour . in the boundary between them , </S>",
    "<S> the mean value of the relevant variable is time - independent , and the exponent of the stationary distribution equals @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of diffusion to the system modifies in a non - trivial way the profile of the stationary distribution . </S>",
    "<S> numerical and analytical results are presented .    </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of power - law distributions ( plds ) is a common feature in the description of natural phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> these distributions appear in a wide class of nonequilibrium systems , ranging from physical processes such as dielectric breakdown , percolation , and rupture @xcite , to biological processes such as dendritic growth and large - scale evolution @xcite , to sociological phenomena such as urban development @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> power - laws have been associated with the effect of the complex driving mechanisms inherent to these systems and with their intrincate dynamical structure . </S>",
    "<S> criticality , fractals , and chaotic dynamics are known to be intimately related to plds @xcite .    in view of the ubiquity of plds in the mathematical description of nature </S>",
    "<S> , much work has been recently devoted to detecting universal mechanisms able to give rise to such distributions . in the frame of equilibrium processes , for instance </S>",
    "<S> , power - laws have been shown to derive from generalized maximum - entropy formulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for nonequilibrium phenomena , self - organized criticality ( soc ) and stochastic multiplicative processes ( smps ) have been identified as sources of plds . according to the soc conjecture @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , some nonequilibrium systems are continuously driven by their own internal dynamics to a critical state where , as for equilibrium phase transitions , power - laws are omnipresent . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , smps @xcite provide a ( more flexible ) mechanism for generating plds , based in the presence of underlying replication events .    </S>",
    "<S> it is however well known that a pure smp , @xmath1 with @xmath2 a random variable , does not generate a stationary pld for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> rather , it gives rise to a time - dependent log - normal distribution . to model the above mentioned phenomena , therefore , smps have to be combined with additional mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that transport processes @xcite , sources @xcite , and boundary constraints @xcite are able to induce a smp to generate power - laws . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present paper is to discuss an alternative additional mechanism , namely , randomly reseting of the relevant variable to a given reference value . in a real system </S>",
    "<S> , this would represent catastrophic annihilation or death events , seemingly originated outside the system .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a discrete - time stochastic multiplicative process @xmath3 , added with reset events in the following way . at each time step , @xmath4 is reset with probability @xmath5 to a new value @xmath6 , drawn from a probability distribution @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> if the reset event does not occur , @xmath4 is multiplied by a random positive factor @xmath2 with probability distribution @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> namely , @xmath9 between two consecutive reset events , @xmath3 thus behaves as a pure multiplicative process . </S>",
    "<S> when one of such events occurs , the multiplicative sequence starts again .    in order to gain insight into the dynamics of process ( [ p0 ] ) we first consider the simplest case where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are constant for all @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> since an arbitrary factor in the initial value of @xmath4 is irrelevant to its subsequent evolution , we take @xmath13 without loss of generality . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus @xmath14 this stochastic recursive equation can be readily solved to give @xmath15 note that the possible values of @xmath3 , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , lie in the interval @xmath18 $ ] for @xmath19 and in @xmath20 $ ] for @xmath21 . except for the extreme value @xmath22 , </S>",
    "<S> the associated probabilities are time - independent . as time elapses , </S>",
    "<S> the probability of each possible value of @xmath3 is therefore quenched for @xmath23 , and the corresponding probability distribution evolves at this extreme value only . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the distribution sequentially builds up in zones that lie increasingly further from @xmath24 .    for large times , when the number of possible values of @xmath3 becomes also large , it is possible to give the probability distribution @xmath25 for @xmath26 $ ] for @xmath19 and @xmath27 for @xmath21 as a function of a continuous variable . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath28 with @xmath29 . in order to account for the contribution at @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath25 should be added with a delta - like term @xmath31 , where the factor @xmath32 can be obtained from the normalization of @xmath25 .    according to ( [ f1 ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> the stochastic process ( [ p1 ] ) gives rise to a _ </S>",
    "<S> stationary power - law _ </S>",
    "<S> distribution @xmath25 in an increasingly large interval of values of @xmath4 . for @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath25 is a stationary power - law distribution in @xmath34 $ ] for @xmath19 , and in @xmath35 for @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with multiplicative processes with boundary constraints @xcite , there are no conditions on the parameters to obtain a stationary power - law distribution . for @xmath36 , </S>",
    "<S> the exponent of this distribution is positive ( @xmath37 ) , and @xmath25 grows with @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , however , the distribution is defined for @xmath38 and exhibits a cut off at @xmath24 . on the other hand , for @xmath39 or @xmath21 the exponent is negative ( @xmath40 ) . for @xmath21 , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. when @xmath41 , the moments @xmath42 diverge for @xmath43 , indicating the presence of intermittent amplifications @xcite . for @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath44 diverges for @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to relate the exponent of the power - law distribution with the evolution of the mean value @xmath46 . from ( [ s1 ] ) , this mean value can be written as @xmath47 for @xmath48 , the mean value of @xmath3 converges to a finite value @xmath49 $ ] , whereas for @xmath50 it `` explodes '' . in the boundary between both regimes , where @xmath51 , the exponent of the distribution is @xmath52 and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this exponent is therefore to be associated with the explosion threshold .    the power - law distribution in ( [ f1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can also be inferred from a description of the evolution of @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , since at each time step where no reset occurs the probability contribution to @xmath54 comes from @xmath55 , we can write @xmath56 assuming now that this distribution is stationary , @xmath57 , a solution to ( [ e1 ] ) is given by @xmath58 , with @xmath59 which produces the same value of @xmath60 as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that ( [ e1 ] ) does not hold for @xmath24 , where the contributions to the probability come from reset events .    </S>",
    "<S> the above argument provides a method for dealing with the general multiplicative process with reset events , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p0 ] ) , when both @xmath2 and @xmath6 are drawn from prescribed probability distributions @xmath8 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath7 is appreciably different from zero in a bounded region , where the contributions from reset events are relevant . outside this region </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of @xmath25 can be written as @xmath61 which generalizes eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e1 ] ) . under the assumption of stationarity </S>",
    "<S> , this equation is solved by @xmath62 , where the exponent @xmath60 must verify @xmath63 for regular forms of @xmath8 this equation has at least one solution for @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> when the probability is mainly concentrated in values of @xmath2 larger than unity the solution is expected to be positive ( @xmath40 ) and _ vice versa_.    as in the case of constant @xmath2 and @xmath6 , a close relation exists here between the evolution of the average @xmath64 and the exponent of the power - law distribution . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , @xmath65 is found to remain stationary along the whole process when @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> again , thus , the exponent @xmath52 is associated with the explosion threshold , and marks the boundary between regular and intermittent evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen , for instance , from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e0 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> multiplication of this equation by @xmath4 and integration over @xmath4 yields @xmath66 \\langle n(t)\\rangle.\\ ] ] comparing with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a ] ) , we readily note that the multiplicative constant @xmath67 that governs the evolution of @xmath64 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ en ] ) equals unity for @xmath52 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , depending on @xmath5 and @xmath68 the system can be in a regular regime where @xmath69 converges to a finite value , or in an intermittence regime , where @xmath70 diverges . at the boundary , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. at the explosion threshold , @xmath71 remains constant and , independently of the specific value of @xmath5 and of the particular form of @xmath68 , the probability distribution @xmath25 exhibits a power - law tail with a characteristic exponent , @xmath72 .    we have numerically checked that the exponent of the stationary profile of @xmath25 does not depend on the particular form of the distribution of reset values @xmath7 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we present the function @xmath25 obtained with constant @xmath2 and @xmath5 , for three different choices of @xmath7 : a uniform distribution between @xmath73 and @xmath13 ( circles ) , an exponential distribution , @xmath74 , with @xmath75 ( squares ) , and a discrete distribution @xmath76/2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the particular form of @xmath77 sets a lower boundary for the region where @xmath25 behaves as a power law , but does not affect the corresponding exponent . </S>",
    "<S> solid lines in the log - log plot of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 have the theoretical slope @xmath78 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows our simulation results for three different forms of @xmath8 : an exponential distribution @xmath79 with @xmath80 , a uniform distribution @xmath81 with @xmath82 $ ] , and a discrete distribution @xmath83 with @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the solid lines has been obtained numerically for various values of @xmath5 from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this yields @xmath87 for the exponential distribution with @xmath88 , @xmath89 for the uniform distribution with @xmath90 , and @xmath91 for the discrete distribution with @xmath92 . in all cases , </S>",
    "<S> our numerical and analytical results are in full agreement within six to nine decades in the power - law region .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also investigated the effects of diffusive transport on the process ( [ p1 ] ) . with this aim , </S>",
    "<S> we have considered a one - dimensional array of elements whose individual dynamics is given by ( [ p1 ] ) and , at each time step , we have incorporated an interaction mechanism that mimics diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> after the multiplicative process with reset events has been applied , the state of each element is further changed to @xmath93 , \\ ] ] where @xmath94 labels the elements in the array , with periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath95 is used as the input state for the next step . in this deterministic , time - discrete version of diffusive transport </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath96 plays the role of a diffusion constant .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 summarizes our numerical results on the effect of diffusion on the smp ( [ p1 ] ) , displaying the dependence of the power - law exponent with the diffusion constant . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen values of @xmath5 and @xmath2 such that the different regimes of the process have been explored . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the multiplicative constant has been fixed in this case to @xmath97 . in the regular regime ( i.e. @xmath48 ) , diffusion produces a decrease of @xmath60 in the power - law distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood if we consider that the role of diffusion is to deplete dense areas , transporting material to less occupied cells . </S>",
    "<S> the multiplicative process is not fast enough in this regime to balance the joint effect of reset events and diffusion . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , underpopulation occurs in the high - density region , and @xmath60 decreases ( @xmath98 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . in the intermittent regime ( @xmath99 i.e. @xmath50 ) </S>",
    "<S> , diffusion favors the opposite effect . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , diffusion does not have any effect on the value of @xmath60 when the system is evolving at the explosion threshold . </S>",
    "<S> within numerical errors , in fact , @xmath52 irrespectively of the value of @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth to point out that the qualitative behaviour of the process depends on @xmath2 and @xmath5 only . </S>",
    "<S> changing @xmath96 does not allow the system to switch between the intermittent and the regular regimes .    summing up , in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have studied a stochastic multiplicative process with reset events . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of this random reseting with the replication events driven by the stochastic process allows for the development of a stationary distribution in the system , both when the mean value of the relevant variable converges to a finite value ( regular regime ) and when it diverges ( intermittent regime ) . </S>",
    "<S> the regime at the boundary between regular and intermittent behaviour is of particular interest . at this point , where the overall effects of the multiplicative process are exactly balanced by the random resets , the mean value of the relevant variable remains constant in time . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that this property is closely related with the fact that the exponent of the power - law stationary distribution equals @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is to be related with zipf law , which predicts the same exponent of power - law distributions in a series of seemingly disparate natural systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the smp with reset events offers an alternative explanation of this ubiquitous exponent . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , whereas a general trend of biological and social systems could be to improve their growth rates by increasing the parameter @xmath2 , it is on the other hand to be expected that external constrains are going to operate in order to avoid divergencies by increasing @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it is not unlikely that the competition between these two processes could lead real systems to this boundary between regular behavior and developed intermittency . </S>"
