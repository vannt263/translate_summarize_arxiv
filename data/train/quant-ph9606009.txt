    "large fluctuations are a salient feature of the thermal behavior of systems of bosons . for example , if @xmath2 is the mean number of non - interacting particles occupying a particular one - particle state , then the mean - square occupation fluctuation is @xmath3 .",
    "this is easily derived in the grand canonical picture by considering diffusive equilibrium with a particle reservoir characterized by a chemical potential@xcite .",
    "if , however , the system has a _ fixed _ total number of particles , @xmath4 , confined in space by a trapping potential or container , then at low enough temperature @xmath5 or fixed total energy @xmath6 when a significant fraction of @xmath4 are in the ground state , such large fluctuations are impossible . no matter how large @xmath4 , this aspect of the grand canonical description can not be even approximately true .",
    "this paper addresses what _ does _ happen for fixed large @xmath4 as @xmath7    a decades - old answer to this question is that any interaction between the particles would eliminate such large fluctuations , even in the presence of a chemical potential . with a weak inter - particle interaction and a chemical potential , fluctuations in the occupations of various states",
    "are only weakly correlated .",
    "therefore , the fluctuation in the total number of particles _ not _ in the ground state is microscopic .",
    "hence , a macroscopic condensate fluctuation would mean a macroscopic density fluctuation .",
    "even if the particles interact weakly , this would mean a macroscopic energy fluctuation .",
    "the consequent macroscopic rise in free energy would suppress the fluctuation .",
    "( see appendix b for a more formal sketch of this argument . ) thus , with interactions producing a finite compressibility , the equivalence of the three standard statistical ensembles is assured in the thermodynamic limit , and the computationally convenient chemical potential can still be used for isolated , large systems@xcite . in the context of bose liquids ,",
    "the ideal gas is a theoretical curiosity .",
    "large condensate fluctuation is only one of several features for which ignoring interactions gives qualitatively incorrect results@xcite .",
    "this argument does not address the question of what _ does _ happen to condensate fluctuations of the ideal bose gas .",
    "this is not a totally idle or purely theoretical question . in current experimental work on the trapping and cooling of bosonic atoms",
    ", there is typically no diffusive particle or thermal energy reservoir@xcite . while the atoms most certainly interact , @xmath8",
    "hence , one can ask about the system as a whole rather than only describing densities ( intensive quantities ) , which are really just sub - volumes in diffusive and thermal equilibrium with their ( much larger ) surroundings . for sub - volumes of an infinite system , @xmath9 and @xmath10 give an appropriate description .",
    "however , for a finite , isolated system taken as a whole , which has a greater impact on the condensate fluctuations , the particle interactions or the constraint of fixed total @xmath4 ?",
    "the answer depends on the density realized in the particular situation .",
    "a practical distinction of a gas from a liquid is that the density can be easily varied over many orders of magnitude . in the first successful experiments@xcite",
    ", there are noticeable effects of interparticle repulsion ; and many of the more detailed observations currently underway require a mean field ( albeit weak ) description of the interparticle scattering length to reconcile theory with observations . nevertheless , it is possible to imagine approaching bose condensation with a box or trap so large and density so low that the effects of a given inter - atomic interaction , characterized by a fixed scattering length , are negligible , even for density fluctuations of order the equilibrium density .",
    "( an estimate of the requisite relation of the scattering length , trap parameters and density is given in appendix b. ) even though the bose - einstein transition temperature decreases with decreasing density , the total energy shift due to a weak fixed - strength inter - particle interaction decreases faster .",
    "also , the actual inter - atomic interactions may not serve to stabilize anything . rather , the gaseous state may itself only be metastable@xcite . in such situations ,",

    "vi ) , while comments on details of the numerical work are left to appendix a. appendix b outlines the simple estimate of the condensate fluctuation damping due to repulsive interactions , which allows a comparison with the effect due to fixing @xmath4 .",
    "it is only the non - interacting particles in the ground state of a trap or confining potential that do not satisfy the hypotheses of the standard demonstration@xcite of the equivalence of the grand canonical and canonical ensembles in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "hence , the questions raised here only arise if the ground state occupation is macroscopic . at ultra - low @xmath14 when almost all particles are in the ground state , the condensate serves as a particle reservoir for all the excited states , and so some form of the grand canonical description for excited states should be valid in that domain .",
    "but what about intermediate @xmath10 s ? is the inequivalence of chemical potential and fixed @xmath4 limited to the size of the ground state fluctuations ? if the condensate manifested the boson propensity for large fluctuations and there were _ any _ macroscopic fluctuation in the condensate number , it would have to be accompanied by correlations between the various occupation numbers .",
    "( such correlations are identically zero for the grand canonical ideal gas . )",
    "there need not be any macroscopic fluctuation in the average density because the total number is fixed .",
    "yet , larger than anticipated exited state fluctuations and correlations might lead to larger fluctuations in the total @xmath6 at fixed @xmath10 . and were this the case , the equivalence of fixing @xmath6 and fixing @xmath10 might be lost in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "there is really no practical alternative for analytic calculations because not much is known directly about the large but fixed @xmath4 asymptotics of the canonical or microcanonical partition functions , even for systems as simple as the ideal bose gas .",
    "if this analytic tool were lost , theory would be reduced almost entirely to numerical techniques .",
    "the resolution of these conundrums lies in the observation that the grand canonical excited state occupations in the thermodynamic limit are independent of not only the condensate fluctuations but the condensate occupation itself . hence ,",
    "if the behavior of the excited state occupancies can be reliably estimated using the concept of a chemical potential , one can deduce the behavior of the condensate from the constraint of fixed @xmath4 .",
    "this argument is really just a minor extension of the traditional one used to compute the condensate fraction@xcite . in particular",
