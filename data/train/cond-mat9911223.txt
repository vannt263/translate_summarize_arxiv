    "functional methods have long been used as a tool to study interacting systems .",
    "these involve techniques ranging from simple weak coupling perturbative methods to strong coupling expansions . often , since it is not possible to sum the entire series of diagrams one takes recourse to various approximation schemes in the hope that they will capture some of the essential physics .",
    "in addition , functional methods , have a long history of systematizing these approximations . a direct way of testing the validity of any approximation is through the effective action approach to interacting systems .",
    "typically , the effective action is obtained in terms of some relevant variable , for e.g. the density , magnetization , the order parameter , the single particle greens function etc .",
    ", as a perturbative series in the interaction",
    ". a well known and frequently used functional is the baym kadanoff functional @xmath0 ( [ bk ] ) @xcite , which is the effective action for the single particle green s function @xmath1 .",

    "very recently , a functional of the green s function whose minimum gives the local green s function of the hubbard model on the bethe lattice was investigated by one of us .",
    "this functional has several desirable properties , in particular it is a true extremum at the physical local greens function . @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to search for generalizations of the functional of ref . to finite dimensions .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new functional @xmath2 for the single particle green s function , for which we can show that its saddle point is in fact an extremum , in the case that the irreducible vertex function in the particle hole channel has a definite sign ( see below for a precise definition ) .",
    "this functional has many other useful properties primarily in the context of dynamical mean field methods which can now be naturally viewed as an approximation to this functional .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we introduce the baym kadanoff functional and our proposed functional and obtain the conditions under which the saddle points of this functional are extrema .",
    "we then proceed to show that the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) equations are a simple outcome of certain simple approximations on our functional , hence providing some justification for direct extensions of dynamical mean field theory to finite dimensions .",

    "we note that the functional is an extremum only if the hermitian matrix @xmath73 is positive or negative definite . referring back to the previous section",
    ", we see that this is not the case even in the non - interacting limit where this operator has eigenvalues of both sign.to summarize , the instability of the stationary solutions of @xmath2 is linked to physical instabilities in the particle hole sector",

    "the validity of these approximations depend on whether ( [ bkder ] ) ( or ( [ newder ] ) for @xmath2 ) are positive or not .",
    "typical approximations range from hartree fock and rpa methods at weak coupling to atomic limits for strong coupling .",
    "recent years have seen the development of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) which is one of the very few methods available to study correlated electron systems in the weak , strong and intermediate coupling regimes .",
    "though this method is exact only in the limit of infinite dimensions , it has been very successful in describing the physics of realistic three dimensional systems , like the transition metal oxides .",

    "there , dmft viewed as a theory for the local green s function , is an exact theory but the functional which needs to be constructed is not known explicitly ( beyond a general diagrammatic series discussed in ref @xcite ) . here",
    "we adopt a different approach and would like to view dynamical mean field theory as an _ approximation _ to a simple functional .",
    "when the saddle point fluctuations ( [ form ] ) are positive , we can gauge the quality of different approximations .",

    "another choice of orbitals would lead to a different trial function ( [ trial ] ) , so a functional perspective offers the possibility of optimizing the basis of orbitals specifically for dmft calculations .",
    "ordinary dynamical mean field theory treats longer range interactions at the level of the hartree approximation .",
    "an extended dynamical mean field approach has been suggested @xcite to partially remove this shortcoming .",
    "recent work on the effects of long range coulomb interactions within dmft have shown that they can substantially modify the behavior near a mott transition @xcite , changing the nature of the transition from a continuous one for short range interactions , to a discontinuous one . in the light of these works and",
    "given the relevance of long range interactions , we present a functional derivation of _ extended _ dmft equations along the lines of sec.[sdmft ] .",

    "the subscript @xmath137 denotes the quantities evaluated at criticality .",
    "we have seen in sec.[newf ] that when @xmath138 ceases to be invertible , an instability sets in the particle hole channel at zero momentum .",
    "this implies a divergent compressibility unless there exist matrix elements which cancel the contribution of the vanishing eigenvalue of the bethe salpeter kernel , which signals the instability .",

    "in fact , even in infinite dimensions , the landau functional at zero temperature has some very singular bifurcations in its phase diagram at which the compressibility does not diverge .",
    "this issue as well as the computation of matrix elements in specific bifurcations requires a problem specific analysis which at this stage can be performed rigorously only in the limit of infinite dimensions@xcite",
    ".    finally it would be useful to extend the analysis to spin dependent green s functions .",
    "this would allow us to understand the effects of magnetism in many cases , examples being the doping driven mott transition in two dimensions , where one approaches a magnetically ordered state and the problem of of the antiferromagnetic metal to antiferromagnetic insulator transition in infinite dimensions that we have studied recently @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have constructed a new functional for the single particle green s function and investigated its use as a variational free energy .",
    "we found that stability of the saddle point solutions was linked to the bethe - salpeter equation in the particle hole sector . from the perspective of applications ,",
    "the use of @xmath2 allows us to derive dmft and extended dmft , directly in finite dimensions , for non translationally invariant geometries .",
    "functional methods provide simple connections between one particle green s functions and particle hole instabilities , and we use these ideas to discuss the compressibility near the mott transition . finally , we have shown that under some circumstances it is possible to understand whether the stationary points of @xmath2 are extrema or saddle points .",
    "we feel that this is a significant advantage , over the baym - kadanoff functional @xmath0 , when used to generate non perturbative approximations using trial green functions .",
    "there is a great deal of freedom , in adding sources to @xmath0 so as to convert its stationary points into extrema , and constructions along the lines of our paper , but with different additions of sources , so as to obtain more general stability conditions than the ones we were able to obtain are well worth pursuing .",

    "<S> we construct a new functional for the single particle green s function , which is a variant of the standard baym kadanoff functional . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of the stationary solutions to the new functional is directly related to aspects of the irreducible particle hole interaction through the bethe salpeter equation . </S>",
    "<S> a startling aspect of this functional is that it allows a simple and rigorous derivation of both the standard and extended dynamical mean field ( dmft ) equations as stationary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> though the dmft equations were formerly obtained only in the limit of infinite lattice coordination , the new functional described in the work , presents a way of directly extending dmft to finite dimensional systems , both on a lattice and in a continuum . </S>",
    "<S> instabilities of the stationary solution at the bifurcation point of the functional , signal the appearance of a zero mode at the mott transition which then couples to physical quantities resulting in divergences at the transition .    </S>"
