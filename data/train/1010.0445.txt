    "quark models provide a simple picture of the physics of ground state baryons and their excitations @xcite , but their connection with qcd is not so clear .",
    "an alternative approach to baryon phenomenology that is closer connected to qcd is provided by the @xmath0 expansion @xcite , which has been applied to the study of both the ground state and excited nucleons @xcite , leading to interesting insights that would be difficult to obtain in a particular model calculation .    in order to bridge the gap between the more intuitive quark model calculations and the effective operator approach , in a recent paper @xcite we showed how to match an arbitrary quark model hamiltonian onto the operators of the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "we made use of the transformation of the states and operators under the permutation group of @xmath2 objects acting on the spin - flavor of the quarks .",
    "the approach is similar to the one discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the orbital part of the interaction and at @xmath3 .",
    "the main result of @xcite can be summarized as follows : consider a two - body quark hamiltonian @xmath4 , where @xmath5 acts on the spin - flavor quark degrees of freedom and @xmath6 acts on the orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "then the hadronic matrix elements of the quark hamiltonian on a baryon state @xmath7 contains only the projections @xmath8 onto irreducible representations of the spin - flavor permutations and can be factorized as @xmath9 , where the coefficients @xmath10 are reduced matrix elements of the orbital operators @xmath6 , given by overlap integrals of the quark model wave functions .",
    "the matching procedure has been discussed in detail for the isgur - karl ( ik ) model in ref .",

    "@xcite we examine the spectrum of @xmath1 negative parity baryons and discuss the implications for the spin - flavor structure of the most general two - body quark interaction .",
    "the present talk summarizes some aspects of this recent work that strive to understand the physics hidden in the numerical values of the fitted coefficients of the general operator expansion .",
    "the isgur - karl model is defined by the quark hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 contains the confining potential and kinetic terms of the quark fields , and is symmetric under spin and isospin .",

    "this interaction hamiltonian is an approximation to the gluon - exchange interaction , neglecting the spin - orbit terms .    in the original formulation of the ik model",
    "@xcite the confining forces are harmonic .",
    "we will derive in the following the form of the mass operator without making any assumption on the shape of the confining quark forces .",
    "we refer to this more general version of the model as ik - v(r ) .",
    "the @xmath1 quark model states include the following su(3 ) multiplets : two spin-1/2 octets @xmath18 , two spin-3/2 octets @xmath19 , one spin-5/2 octet @xmath20 , two decuplets @xmath21 and two singlets @xmath22",

    "we find @xcite that the most general mass operator in the ik - v(r ) model depends only on three unknown orbital overlap integrals , plus an additive constant @xmath28 related to the matrix element of @xmath12 , and can be written as @xmath29 where the spin - flavor operators are understood to act on the state @xmath30 constructed as a tensor product of the core of quarks 2,3 and the ` excited ' quark 1 , as given in @xcite .",

    "( [ hik ] ) , one finds that the reduced matrix elements in the ik model with harmonic oscillator wave functions are all related and can be expressed in terms of the single parameter @xmath35 as @xmath36 this gives a relation among the coefficients @xmath37 of the mass matrix eq .",
    "( [ ikmass ] ) : @xmath38 we recover the well known result that in the harmonic oscillator model , the entire spectroscopy of the @xmath1 baryons is fixed by one single constant @xmath39 , along with an overall additive constant @xmath28 , and the model becomes very predictive .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] we show the result of a best fit of @xmath37 in the ik - v(r ) model together with the predictions of the ik model .",
    "the ik - v(r ) spectrum is the best fit possible for a potential model with the spin - flavor interaction given in eq .",
    "( [ hik ] ) .",
    "the most general quark hamiltonian containing only two - body interactions has the form @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the part of the quark hamiltonian which does not depend on the quarks spin and flavor degrees of freedom .",

    ".    we will consider the case of contact scalar interactions @xmath47 and study the following question : what information can be obtained from the coefficients @xmath48 of the @xmath0 studies of the spectrum of @xmath1 negative parity baryons ?",
    "the quark hamiltonian @xmath49 is matched onto the hadronic mass operator @xmath50 where the ellipses denote terms arising from the tensor and spin - orbit interactions , which were considered in ref .",
    "all three possible zero range two - body interactions @xmath51 and @xmath52 lead to @xmath53 and are matched onto the same operator @xmath54 in the effective theory .",
    "this means that there is no way to distinguish between these three types of scalar interactions as long as they are of very short range .",
    "experimentally , at @xmath3 one can determine only two linear combinations of the three coefficients @xmath55 ( as functions of @xmath56 ) @xcite from the mass spectrum and mixing angles of the negative parity @xmath1 baryons .",
    "these linear combinations can be taken as @xmath57 and their explicit expressions in terms of the nonstrange hadron masses and mixing angles can be found in ref .",

    "@xcite we obtain @xmath62 the corresponding ratio of the coefficients @xmath63 displays the relative suppression of @xmath64 @xmath65 an alternative determination of this ratio can be made using only the excited baryon masses , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "it was shown that in any quark model containing only two - body quark interactions there is a correlation between both mixing angles ( up to a discrete ambiguity ) that corresponds to the dashed and solid lines in fig .",

    "[ fig : ratioc12 ] the first determination of the ratio eq .",
    "( [ cratio ] ) is shown as the black point with error bars and falls within the dark ( green ) area .",
    "finally , it is interesting to notice @xcite that for the particular case ( @xmath68 ) of the spin - flavor structure corresponding to one - pion exchange @xmath64 vanishes regardless of the spatial range of the orbital part of the interaction ( although for non - zero range @xmath69 do not vanish separately ) .

    "this explicit model calculation of the operator coefficients ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) connects two different approaches to baryon phenomenology and is an illustration of the general matching procedure discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite using the permutation group .    considering the most general spin - flavor structure for the scalar part of the two - body quark interactions we find @xcite that in the case of contact interactions all spin - flavor structures are matched onto the same effective operator in the @xmath0 expansion . for the particular case of a pion exchange interaction this holds independently of the range of the spatial part of the interaction . comparing the values obtained for the operator coefficients from masses and independent determinations of mixing angles",
