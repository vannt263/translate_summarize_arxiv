    "however , quantum field theory on static space - times is technically much easier than on dynamical space - times . for an eternal schwarzschild black hole",
    ", the unruh state @xcite contains an outgoing thermal flux of radiation at future null infinity , and therefore is the state analogous to that at late times for a black hole formed by gravitational collapse .",
    "since all two - dimensional space - times are locally conformally flat , quantum field theory on two - dimensional space - times is rather simpler than in four space - time dimensions , particularly if one is considering dynamical space - times . in particular , two - dimensional black hole space - times",
    "have proven to be useful toy models for understanding various aspects of quantum field theory on four - dimensional black holes , in particular hawking radiation and black hole evaporation @xcite .",
    "one advantage of working in two space - time dimensions is that there is an exact prescription @xcite for computing the renormalized expectation value of the stress - energy tensor @xmath0 for a massless scalar field . applying this prescription to a two - dimensional asymptotically flat space - time describing a black hole formed by gravitational collapse",
    ", it is found that at late times after the gravitational collapse , far from the black hole @xmath1 contains an outgoing flux of energy compared to that at early times before the collapse starts @xcite .",
    "this outgoing flux is the hawking radiation and is also found in the expectation value @xmath0 for the unruh vacuum state on an eternal two - dimensional schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "a natural question is how the above picture is modified in space - times with different asymptotic structure .",
    "the case of a schwarzschild - de sitter black hole was studied many years ago .",
    "working in two space - time dimensions , any static quantum state defined in the region between the event and cosmological horizons must have a stress - energy tensor @xmath0 which diverges at either the event or the cosmological horizon @xcite , in agreement with the four - dimensional kay - wald theorem that there is no stationary , nonsingular state on schwarzschild - de sitter space - time @xcite .",

    "in other words , the null coordinates @xmath20 have the same functional form at late times in terms of the exterior null coordinates @xmath79 .    to find this functional form , consider modes seen by an observer far from the black hole at late times .",

    "considering now the internal null coordinates , in our small neighbourhood of @xmath34 , we have @xmath96 ignoring higher - order terms .",
    "therefore , at @xmath37 , the interior and exterior outgoing null coordinates are related by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the value of the interior null coordinate @xmath62 at @xmath34 ( which is finite ) , @xmath99 is a constant and we have ignored terms which are finite as @xmath100 . note that @xmath101 at @xmath37 . to match the modes ( [ eq : extmodes ] , [ eq : intmodes ] ) at @xmath37 , such that the boundary conditions at both @xmath48 and @xmath59 are satisfied , it must be the case that the functional relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath63 is the same as that between @xmath6 and @xmath62 at @xmath37 , namely : @xmath102    we now need to trace the ray back to early times .",

    ", we can now define the null coordinates @xmath20 at late times for the modes ( [ eq : dfumodes ] ) , implicitly via the following relations : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a constant and @xmath113 is a function which is finite as @xmath114 , for a constant @xmath115 which is the value of @xmath13 on the future event horizon @xmath33 .",

    "similarly , there is a maximum value of @xmath14 , say @xmath118 , for modes exterior to the event horizon at late times .",
    "this corresponds to the value of @xmath14 for the ingoing ray which , after reflection at the origin at the point @xmath35 in figure [ fig : one ] , forms the event horizon .",
    "the field modes ( [ eq : latephi ] ) must vanish at the origin , in particular at the point @xmath35 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath121 .",
    "we now use the definitions ( [ eq : earlyuv ] , [ eq : lateuv ] ) to compute the stress - energy tensor in the vacuum state @xmath19 using the method outlined in section [ sec : dfu ] .",

    "our analysis has indicated that the state at late times for a quantum field on a black hole in ads formed by gravitational collapse is in fact the hartle - hawking vacuum .",
    "it should be emphasised however , that our choice of reflective boundary conditions on the ads boundary is crucial for obtaining this result .",
    "for example , a toy model very similar to ours is studied in @xcite , where it is concluded that the state soon after the black hole forms will be analogous to the asymptotically flat space - time unruh state ( that is , an outgoing flux of thermal radiation but no incoming flux ) . however , in @xcite reflecting boundary conditions are not imposed at @xmath48 .",
    "another key part of our analysis is that we have assumed that the shell collapses rapidly to form the black hole . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the quantum field remains in the boulware - like state if the shell is lowered quasi - statically towards the event horizon .",
    "our analysis makes no distinction between `` small '' and `` large '' ( relative to the ads length scale @xmath40 ) black holes , the latter of which are thermodynamically stable @xcite while the former are thermodynamically unstable and are therefore expected to evaporate .",
    "this is because we have considered a fixed ( but dynamical ) space - time geometry and ignored backreaction effects , which may be very significant for a collapsing shell of quantum matter in ads ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that even `` large '' asymptotically ads black holes may evaporate if the boundary conditions on @xmath48 are changed , for example , by coupling to an external field so that the ads boundary is at least partially absorbing ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we consider a massless quantum scalar field on a two - dimensional space - time describing a thin shell of matter collapsing to form a schwarzschild - anti - de sitter black hole . at early times , before the shell starts to collapse , the quantum field is in the vacuum state , corresponding to the boulware vacuum on an eternal black hole space - time . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar field satisfies reflecting boundary conditions on the anti - de sitter boundary . using the davies - fulling - unruh prescription for computing the renormalized expectation value of the stress - energy tensor </S>",
    "<S> , we find that at late times the black hole is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at the hawking temperature , so the quantum field is in a state analogous to the hartle - hawking vacuum on an eternal black hole space - time . </S>"
