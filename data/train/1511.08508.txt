    "with relatively low masses and small physical sizes , m dwarfs are attractive targets for the search and characterization of small planets .",
    "gj 1214b is one of the most intensely observed exoplanets , and the first detailed atmospheric characterization of this intermediate - sized planet between earth- and neptune - like ones was enabled by the large transit depth and brightness of its host star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , both the census of small planets around mid - to - late m dwarfs ( stars with effective temperatures of @xmath10 k ) and the atmospheric characterization of these objects are still in their infancy ; only five transiting systems ( gj 1214 , gj 1132 , kepler-42 , kepler-445 , and kepler-446 ) have been reported to date around mid - to - late m dwarfs @xcite , and the latter three are too faint or the transit depths too shallow to permit intensive follow - up studies .",
    "the failure of a second reaction wheel ended the _ kepler _ prime mission , but the spacecraft s second mission (  k2 \" ) consists of observations of new fields and new targets with a cycle of @xmath11 days @xcite .",
    "k2 has so far unveiled many planetary systems with distinguishing characteristics , including a compact multi - planet system with sub - saturn - mass planets in the 3:2 mean motion resonance , multiple systems with earth- to super - earth - sized planets around rather bright m dwarfs @xcite , and a disintegrating minor planet around a white dwarf @xcite . in order to fully exploit the worldwide ground facilities for k2 follow - ups ,",
    "we had started the esprint ( _ equipo de seguimiento de planetas rocosos intepretando sus transitos _ ) collaboration , which aims to discover and characterize unique transiting planets unveiled by k2 .",
    "esprint has contributed to the k2 haul of discoveries with a disintegrating ultra - short period planet with a cometary tail around an m dwarf ( esprint i : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and confirmation of three systems in the campaign 1 field by radial velocity measurements ( esprint ii : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    "we validate a @xmath12 planet around a mid - m star in k2 campaign 3 , which is located at a high galactic latitude ( @xmath13 ) and samples a distinct stellar population from the prime _ kepler",
    "_ mission .",
    "our target is labeled as epic 206318379 ( which we call k2 - 28  hereafter ) with the kepler magnitude of @xmath14 .",
    "the relative brightness of the star in the near infrared ( e.g. , @xmath8 ) summarized in table [ hyo1 ] from the sdss @xcite and 2mass @xcite catalogs suggest that it is a rather cool star ( @xmath15 k ) and thus an excellent target for further follow - up studies .",
    "we organize the rest of the paper as follows . in section [ s : obs ] , we describe how we reduced and detected the planet candidates in k2 field 3 , and present the ground - based observations for the target , including follow - up transit observations with the infrared survey facility ( irsf ) 1.4-m telescope and okayama 1.88-m telescope , low - resolution spectroscopy with uh88 and the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) , and adaptive - optics ( ao ) imaging with the subaru 8.2-m telescope .",
    "we then carefully analyze the ground and space - based transit observations in section [ s : analysis ] using gaussian processes .",
    "the transit depths from the ground - based follow - ups are compared to that from the k2 reduced light curve , and consequently we show that they are all in agreement within @xmath3 .",
    "section [ s : astrovalid ] describes to what extent we are able to exclude the false positive scenario by first computing the probability that the transit - like signal is caused by a background eclipsing binary , which turns out to be very low ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the almost constant transit depths from the optical to the near infrared also put a constraint on the magnitude of possible close - in companion around k2 - 28 .",
    "finally , section [ s : discussion ] is devoted to discussion and summary .",
    "the images of all the k2 campaign 3 targets were downloaded from mast , and we used our own tools ( described in detail in * ? ? ? * ) to produce corrected light curves ready for our planet search routines .",
    "in particular , field 3 targets were observed for 69 days , from 2014 november 15 through 2015 january 23 .",
    "the dataset was split into 9 segments with a duration of approximately 7.5 days each .",
    "because of the faintness of k2 - 28 , we defined an aperture at each segment with all the pixels that had 4% more counts than the mean background on at least 50% of the images of that segment .",
    "the light curves are corrected both for instrumental noise induced by the motion of the telescope and astrophysical long term variability using independent 4th - order polynomials with both time and centroid motion as variables .",
    "we searched the processed long cadence light curves in k2 campaign 3 for planet candidates using a box - fitting least squares routine .",
    "we improved the efficiency of the original bls by implementing the optimal frequency sampling described in .",
    "k2 - 28  emerged as a clear detection with snr of @xmath179 .",
    "a linear ephemeris analysis gave a best - fit period of @xmath18 days and mid - transit time of @xmath19 .",
    "in the archived sdss image of k2 - 28  there is a second , fainter ( @xmath20 mag ) source @xmath21 to the north - east .",
    "we made sure that given the difference in magnitude , there is no excess of brightness detected in the k2 data pixels around the location of the faint companion seen in the sdss image .",
    "our imaging and astrometric analysis show the fainter source to have proper motion with respect to k2 - 28  and is thus physically unrelated and probably a background star ( section [ s : astrometry ] ) .",
    "we determined the position of the star at the epoch of k2 observations , designed a k2 photometric aperture that excludes this star but includes the 8 brightest pixels for k2 - 28 and extract a light curve using this aperture and the public code outlined in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fullcurve ] shows thus extracted light curves with and without the correction for the centroid motions and baseline flux variations .",
    "some of the data points , including ones during transits , are missing in the reduced light curve ( bottom ) , mainly due to the removal of outliers when we corrected for the centroid motion and baseline function .",
    "the revised light curve contains the same transit events with the same depth , suggesting that k2 - 28  and not the fainter star is the source of the signal .",
    "we also performed an odd - even test by folding the k2 light curve with twice the period of k2 - 28  b. as shown in figure [ fig : oddeven ] , the odd and even transits exhibit equal depths within @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is defined as the depth uncertainty for each folded transit in the preliminary depth measurement , indicating that we have identified the correct period .",
    "the odd - even test also shows no indication of a secondary eclipse , excluding many false - positive scenarios involving an eclipsing binary .",
    "we therefore conducted a campaign of follow - up observations to validate this candidate planet .",
    "we conducted a follow - up transit observation with the simultaneous infrared imager for unbiased survey ( sirius ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mounted on the irsf 1.4-m telescope at south african astronomical observatory on 2015 august 7 ut .",
    "sirius has three infrared detectors , each having 1,024 @xmath24 1,024 pixels with the pixel scale of 045 pixel@xmath25 , allowing @xmath26- , @xmath27- , and @xmath28-band simultaneous imaging .",
    "the exposure times were set to 30  s for all bands .",
    "we started the observation at 20:50 ut and continued it until 24:03 ut ( the airmass had changed from 1.54 to 1.10 ) , covering the expected duration of a transit . during the sirius observation , we employed the position - locking software to fix the centroid of stellar images within a few pixels from the initial position @xcite .    , @xmath27 , @xmath29 bands , respectively . the best - fit transit model for each band",
    "is shown by the red solid line .",
    "light curves in different bands have a vertical offset for clarity.,width=321 ]    the observed images were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded in the standard manner . for the flat fielding , we combined 15 , 18 , and 17 twilight flat images for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 bands , respectively , taken before and after the observation .",
    "we then performed aperture photometry using two , one , and one comparison star(s ) for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , respectively , by using a custom code @xcite .",
    "the aperture sizes of 6.0 , 8.0 , and 6.0 pixels were selected for the @xmath26- , @xmath27- , and @xmath28-band data to minimize the dispersion of the light curves with respect to the best - fit transit models .",
    "the time system of the light curves was converted from julian day ( jd ) to barycentric jd ( bjd ) by the code of @xcite .",
    "the resulting light curves are plotted in the top panel of figure [ fig : irsf_jhk ] .",
    "we also conducted a follow - up transit observation with the multicolor simultaneous camera for studying atmospheres of transiting exoplanets ( muscat ; * ? ? ? * ) mounted on the 188-cm telescope at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) on 2015 august 23 ut .",
    "muscat consists of three ccds , each having 1,024 @xmath24 1,024 pixels with the pixel scale of 036 pixel@xmath25 , allowing simultaneous three - band imaging through the generation 2 sloan @xmath30- , @xmath31- , and @xmath32-band filters .",
    "muscat can also fix the centroid of stellar images within @xmath33 pixel from the initial position @xcite . because the @xmath30-band channel was not available at that time due to an instrumental trouble , we used the remaining two channels for the observation .",
    "the exposure times were set to 120  s and 60  s for the @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands , respectively .",
    "we started the observation at 17:10 ut and continued it until 18:48 ut ( the airmass had changed from 1.54 to 2.33 ) , covering the first half of the transit .     and @xmath32 bands , respectively .",
    "the best - fit transit model for each band is shown by the red solid line .",
    "light curves in different bands have a vertical offset for clarity.,width=321 ]    the observed images were reduced by the same procedure as done in section [ sec : irsf_obs ] . for the flat fields , we used one hundred dome - flat images taken on the same observing night for all bands .",
    "we performed the aperture photometry using three comparison stars for all bands , with the aperture sizes of 18 pixels for both of the @xmath31- and @xmath32-band data .",
    "the produced light curves are shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : oao_rz ] .",
    "we note that the comparison stars of our ground - based photometry are all solar - type ones with their colors ranging from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , which are in stark contrast to the color of k2 - 28  ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this difference could be a source of systematic effects in the reduced light curves arising from relative flux variations by e.g. , changing precipitable water vapor and target s airmass .",
    "but the five photometric bands that we employed are generally less affected by the telluric water absorption , and in particular , the @xmath32-band is designed to avoid strong telluric absorption .",
    "the target s airmass was changing monotonically during the irsf and oao runs , and thus its impact is not expected to be large as long as the baseline of the light curve is corrected from the out - of - transit flux data .",
    "we obtained an optical spectrum of k2 - 28  with the supernova integral field spectrograph ( snifs * ? ? ?",

    "with @xmath80 derived from the optical spectrum and @xmath60 $ ] from the nir spectrum , we computed the stellar radius and mass following the empirical relations from @xcite .",
    "these values are reported in table [ hyo1 ] along with other derived parameters ( i.e. , the stellar density @xmath70 , surface gravity @xmath62 , and distance to the star ) .",
    "we conducted a high - angular resolution imaging with the subaru telescope equipped with the adaptive optics ( ao ) instrument ao188 and the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs , kobayashi et al .",
    "2000 ) on 2015 september 17 ut .",
    "we used the `` high - resolution '' mode of ircs , which has a pixel scale of 20.6 mas pixel@xmath25 and the fov of 211 @xmath24 211 .",
    "we used the target star itself as a natural guide star .",
    "the target star was observed through the @xmath81-band filter at nine dithering points , each with the exposure time of 30  s ( 2  s @xmath24 15 coadds ) , resulting in the total integration time of 270  s. the airmass was 1.26 and the ao - worked full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the target @xmath17018 .",
    "the observed images were dark - subtracted and flat - fielded in a standard manner .",
    "twilight flat images taken in the morning were used for the flat fielding .",
    "the reduced images were then aligned , sky - level - subtracted , and median - combined .",
    "the combined image and the 5-@xmath23 contrast curve are shown in figure [ fig : ircs ] .",
    "due to the sparse time sampling of the k2 data ( @xmath82 hour ) in comparison with the transit duration ( @xmath83 hour ) , the folded k2 transit curve looks v - shaped as shown in figure [ fig : k2transit ] .",
    "this leads to a degeneracy in system parameters ( i.e. , the scaled semi - major axis @xmath84 , transit impact parameter @xmath85 , and planet - to - star radius ratio @xmath86 ) when we fit the time - integrated k2 flux data alone .",
    "on the other hand , the follow - up transit curves exhibit a clearer ingress ( egress ) and flat bottom ( especially in the @xmath32-band ) in spite of the worse photometric precision than _ kepler _ , suggesting that the transiting body is significantly smaller than the central late - type star .",
    "the clear ingress and egress also enable us to better constrain the transit parameters , and thus we here decide to fit the follow - up transit curves simultaneously with the k2 light curve .",
    "when a source of dilution , i.e. a physical companion star or background star , is present in the photometric aperture , the transit depths measured in different bands may vary depending on the contrast ratio of the objects in each band .",
    "conversely , a wavelength - independent transit depth is suggestive of no dilution source in the aperture , on the assumption that the diluting star does not have an identical spectral energy distribution as that of the primary",
    ". thus , in order to constrain the presence of possible dilution sources , we attempt to measure the radius ratio for each observed band as accurately as possible , and compare the results in different bands from the optical to the near infrared .",
    "since only a part of the transit is observed for oao datasets , we do not attempt to fit the light curves in individual bands , but combine all the transit curves and perform a global fit .",
    "we employ the method of gaussian processes ( gp ) to obtain the most accurate radius ratio for each band from our current datasets .",
    "in addition to the flux counts , ground - based observations in general provide many auxiliary variables such as target s pixel centroid drifts , sky background count , target s fwhm in the photometric aperture , etc .",
    ", which are not monotonic functions of time .",
    "time - correlated noises are also present in our datasets owing both to the intrinsic stellar activity and other instrumental systematics . taking account of these pieces of information in modeling the observed light curves yields more accurate estimates for the model parameters ( e.g. , *",
    "a gp model assumes that the observed flux values with @xmath87 points follow a multi - variable gaussian : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the observed and modeled flux vectors ( with @xmath87 components ) , and @xmath91 is the covariance matrix . when @xmath91 has only diagonal components , representing independent gaussian noises in individual fluxes , the exponent in equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) reduces to @xmath92 .",
    "by introducing non - diagonal components in the covariance matrix @xmath91 , we can deal with correlated noises among flux values , not only as a function of time but also functions of other auxiliary parameters like pixel centroid shifts and sky background counts , which are often corrected by modeling the baseline flux variations with e.g. , polynomials of the parameters . in a gp modeling",
    ", we do not need to assume such a functional form for the flux variation by auxiliary variables , and the best correlation pattern among the flux values are found in the fitting process through an optimization of hyper - parameters @xcite .",
    "we estimate the posterior distribution of the system parameter vector @xmath93 using bayes theorem : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the likelihood of the flux values and @xmath96 is a prior distribution for the system parameters . in the present case , where we simultaneously model the observed fluxes in five different bands with gp ,",
    "the likelihood @xmath97 is expressed as a product of gaussians given in equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) for individual bands : @xmath98 where @xmath99 , and @xmath100 and @xmath101 are @xmath102th band s observed and model flux vectors each comprised of @xmath103 rows , and @xmath104 is the covariance matrix of @xmath105 for that dataset .",
    "the vectors @xmath106 and @xmath107 are transit model parameters and hyper - parameters , respectively , which are to be optimized by the procedure below . for the model flux",
    "@xmath101 , we use the analytic model by @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : muscat_onfocus ] plots our latest @xmath32-band image taken by muscat on 2015 august 23 ut , in which we found the faint companion with the same magnitude difference as in sdss , located further from k2 - 28 . considering the proper motion of k2 - 28  ( @xmath169 mas yr@xmath25 and @xmath170 mas yr@xmath25 ) @xcite ,",
    "the expected current separation between the two is @xmath171 on the assumption that the fainter object is a background one .",
    "after calibrating the coordinates of both stars , we find that the faint companion stays at the almost same location while the current coordinate of k2 - 28  has slightly moved to @xmath172",
    ". the current separation between the two is estimated as @xmath173 , which is fully consistent with the background scenario of the faint object .",
    "although the coordinate of the background star is outside of our custom - made aperture in the k2 photometry , a portion of its pixel response function ( prf ) is involved in the aperture , meaning that the background star could still be a source of false positive .",
    "we checked the magnitude of its contamination on k2 - 28  assuming the averaged prf for _ kepler _ prime mission ( equation ( 10 ) in * ? ? ? * ) . to estimate the fraction of the companion s prf that falls on our custom - made aperture , we simplified the aperture so that it is a circle encompassing all the aperture pixels with its radius being @xmath174 .",
    "the resulting companion s prf fraction was estimated as @xmath175 , and combining this with the magnitude difference between the two stars ( @xmath176 ) , we estimated the maximum contamination from this companion as @xmath177 .",
    "the prf for k2 could be larger than for the _ kepler _ prime mission , but since the aperture does not extend to the coordinate of the background star , the prf fraction can not exceed @xmath82 . along with the fact that the maximum flux contamination from the companion star is smaller than the observed transit depth ( @xmath178 ) ,",
    "we conclude that it is not responsible for the transit - like signal detected in our pipeline .",
    "note that we also checked the current coordinate of k2 - 28  in the sdss image , finding no bright object which could become a possible source of false positives .",
    "we performed a bayesian calculation of the false positive probability ( fpp ) that the signal arises from a background star ( i.e. , an eclipsing binary , eb ) in the vicinity of the location of k2 - 28 .",
    "the calculation does not address the probability that such a star is actually a binary on an eclipsing orbit , but address the probability that an appropriate star is close on the sky to produce the signal , and thus it is an upper limit on fpp .",
    "the procedure is described in detail in gaidos et al .",
    "submitted , apj , and only briefly described here .",
    "the calculation multiplies a prior probability based on a model of the background stellar population by likelihoods from observational constraints . the synthetic background population at the location of k2 - 28was constructed using trilegal version 1.6 @xcite : to improve counting statistics , the population equivalent to 10 sq .",
    "deg . was computed .",
    "the background was computed to @xmath179 , i.e. far fainter than the faintest object ( @xmath180 ) that could produce the signal if it were an eb with the maximum eclipse depth of 50% .",
    "the likelihood factors are the probabilities that ( a ) the background star can produce the observed transit depth ; ( b ) the mean density of the background star is consistent with the observed transit duration ; and ( c ) the background star does not appear in our subaru icrs - ao @xmath181-band imaging of the k2 - 28  ( section [ s : ircs ] ) .",
    "the calculation was performed by monte carlo : it sampled the synthetic background population randomly and placed them randomly and uniformly over a @xmath182-radius circle centered on k2 - 28 . stars that violated the ao contrast ratio constraint ( condition c ) were excluded .",
    "given the known orbital period and mean density of the synthetic star , the probability that a binary would have an orbit capable of producing the observed transit duration ( condition b ) was calculated assuming a rayleigh distribution of orbital eccentricities with mean of 0.1 .",
    "( binaries on short - period orbits should quickly circularize . ) to determine whether a background star could produce the observed transit signal with an eclipse depth @xmath183 ( condition a ) , we determined the relative contribution to the flux of k2 - 28  using bilinear interpolations of the prf for detector channel 48 with the tables provided in the supplement to the kepler instrument handbook ( e. van cleve & d. a. caldwell , ksci-19033 ) .",
    "the calculations were performed in a series of 1000 monte carlo iterations and a running average used to monitor convergence .",
    "we found a fpp of @xmath184 and therefore , we rule out the false positives by a background eclipsing binary .",
    "the remaining false positive case is that a physically associated stellar companion is present around k2 - 28 .",
    "the bound companion could have a transiting object ( case a ) , or k2 - 28  could have a transiting object but its depth is diluted by the bound companion ( case b ) .",
    "our ao image achieves a @xmath185 contrast of @xmath186 at a separation of @xmath187 , which translates to @xmath188 au from k2 - 28 .",
    "thus , it is possible that a bound companion later than m4 dwarf is present within this distance from the central star .",
    "however , the similar values for the transit depth ( @xmath86 ) from the optical to near infrared suggest that case a is unlikely , when the bound companion has a different spectral type from k2 - 28 .    to quantify this statement , we refit the observed light curves introducing a  dilution factor \" @xmath189 , defined as the ratio of the companion s flux to that of k2 - 28  in each bandpass .",
    "the companion has to be equal to or later than m4 dwarf since our spectroscopy implies k2 - 28  is the dominant source of brightness in the system .",
    "thus , @xmath189 is in general larger in the infrared than in the optical . on the assumption that the later - type companion has a transiting object ( case a )",
    ", we search for a solution to the observed light curves as in section [ s : analysis ] .",
    "we assume various stellar types for the companion , and employ the contrast ratio for each band from @xcite .",
    "we simply use the @xmath190 and @xmath191 magnitudes in @xcite to represent the muscat @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands , and @xmath192 is computed by @xmath193 . as a result of the global fit to the ground - based transit follow - ups along with the k2 light curve including @xmath189 , we find that a companion later than m4 dwarf leads to an incompatible result : in case of an m5 dwarf companion , the intrinsic radius ratio of the eclipsing objects in the optical ( e.g. , @xmath194 for the kepler band ) becomes inconsistent with that in the infrared ( e.g. , @xmath195 for the @xmath26 band ) with @xmath196 . hence , the putative bound companion ( having a transiting object ) around k2 - 28 , if any , has to be another m4 dwarf . even in this case , the transiting object falls on the planetary regime considering that the maximum possible dilution ( m4+m4 binary case ) brings about an underestimation of the radius ratio by a factor of @xmath197 .    for the rest of the discussion , we resort to the statistics to constrain the possible dilution scenario by computing the probability that  k2 - 28",
    "has an almost identical bound stellar companion \" .",
    "first , the probability that an m dwarf ( @xmath198 ) has any stellar companion is @xmath199 , and the probability that their mass ratio @xmath200 is greater than 0.75 ( @xmath201 mass ratio between m4 and m5 dwarfs ) is @xmath202 on the assumption that the probability distribution of @xmath200 follows @xmath203 with @xmath204 .",
    "then , adopting the log - normal distribution for the period @xmath146 , we estimate the probability that binary s semi - major axis is smaller than 5 au as @xmath205 .",
    "thus , the total probability that k2 - 28  has such an m4 companion is @xmath206 .",
    "this is not critically low , yet we can safely say that it is more likely that k2 - 28  is a single star with a transiting super - earth / mini - neptune are conventionally referred to as super - earths and k2 - 28 s radius ( @xmath207 ) suggests that its mass is smaller than @xmath208 .",
    "but the division could also depend on the host star s type and orbital period . ] .",
    "we note that case b of the dilution scenario is also possible , but this possibility is not so high as well following the same discussion above . in order to estimate the maximum radius ratio , we repeat the fit of the light curves with @xmath209 , representing the case that a bound m4 dwarf identical to k2 - 28  is present in the system .",
    "the global fit to the observed light curves yields @xmath210 , corresponding to @xmath211 .",
    "again , this is an upper limit of the planet radius , and the planetary size is much closer to @xmath212 when the dilution source is later than m4 .",
    "all these dilution possibilities could be settled by taking a high resolution spectrum of the target and checking the binarity from the line blending , although the faintness of the target would make it challenging in the optical region ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "we have conducted intensive follow - up observations for k2 - 28 , which emerged as a planet - host candidate within the esprint collaboration .",
    "our optical spectroscopy indicates that k2 - 28  is a metal - rich m4 dwarf , located at @xmath214 pc away from us .",
    "based on the absence of bright sources in the ao image taken by subaru / ircs , we computed the probability that the transit - like signal is caused by a background eclipsing binary , and showed that such an fpp is very low ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "the remaining possible false positive scenario is that a physically associated companion has a transiting object , but this still puts k2 - 28b in the planetary regime considering the maximum possible dilution case .",
    "our ground - based transit follow - ups using oao / muscat and irsf / sirius revealed similar transit depths in different bands from the optical to the near infrared , thus showing such a bound companion is not likely to exist around k2 - 28 , with the probability being @xmath206 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the high cadence photometry of ground - based follow - ups helped to break the degeneracy between the system parameters .",
    "the poor sampling of the k2 data makes the transit curve v - shaped as shown in figure [ fig : k2transit ] , which could be explained by a grazing eclipsing binary , but follow - up transits exhibit flat bottoms in all bands , which are suggestive of a small transiting body . even in the absence of a prior probability on the stellar density in fitting the follow - up transits ,",
    "we could obtain a relatively tight constraint on the scaled semi - major axis and radius ratio .",
    "this case clearly demonstrates the importance of transit follow - ups from the ground to validate planetary candidates with relatively short transit durations .    despite the careful analysis for the follow - up transits using gp , the transit depths in the @xmath165 and @xmath28 bands shows a moderate disagreement ( @xmath3 ) with that in the kepler band",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : rprs ] . as discussed below , these differences in @xmath86 are significantly larger than the ones expected from the different optically - thick planet radii in individual bands ( @xmath215 at the most assuming a hydrogen - rich atmosphere ) .",
    "the disagreement in the @xmath165 band could be due to the lack of egress combined with the small number of data points during the transit . at the end of the oao / muscat run ,",
    "the target was also low in elevation , suggesting that higher airmass may have caused some systematics . to take account of the airmass - related systematics",
    ", we also performed a global fit to the observed light curves including an airmass - dependent gp term in equation ( [ eq : covariant ] ) .",
    "the result of the fit was fully consistent with the result without the airmass - dependent gp term ( i.e. , @xmath216 for the @xmath165 band ) .",
    "on the other hand , if we simply remove the flux data taken at higher airmass ( @xmath217 ) from the oao dataset , the global fit yields @xmath218 for the @xmath165 band , which agrees with @xmath86 in the kepler band with @xmath219 .",
    "this treatment is rather arbitrary so that we do not claim its result as the final one .",
    "further transit observations covering a whole transit would be able to settle this issue .",
    "we also investigated the reason for the disagreement in the @xmath28 band by checking the raw images taken by irsf .",
    "we found that the fwhm of the target image slightly changed ( by @xmath220 ) during our irsf observation , and that variation was not a monotonic function of time ; the fwhm takes its maximum during the transit .",
    "although we have incorporated the fwhm as an input auxiliary variable in the gp regression to the correlated noises , this significant variation in fwhm may have caused further systematics in the extracted light curves .",
    "to further investigate this possibility , we adopt time - variable apertures and set each aperture radius as fwhm multiplied by a constant value ( e.g. , 0.6 ) , and extracted light curves again . then , following the fitting procedure described in section [ s : analysis ] , we estimate the planet - to - star radius ratio for each band . consequently , we find @xmath221 for the @xmath28 bands ( figure [ fig : rprs ] : open squares ) .",
    "this value is consistent with the transit depth in the kepler band ( @xmath222 ) , but the photometric precision turns out to be much worse than the fixed - aperture photometry .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy between the light curves for fixed and time - variable apertures is not known , but imperfect correction for flat - fielding or inclusion of scattered light from a neighboring star could be relevant .",
    "@xcite found that while the occurrence rate of earth - sized planets ( @xmath223 ) around coolest m dwarfs monitored by _",
    "kepler _ is consistent with that around hotter m dwarfs ( @xmath224 k ) , the occurrence rate of super - earths around cooler m dwarfs is significantly smaller than that around hotter m dwarfs .",
    "figure [ fig : midm_planets ] plots the transiting planets around m dwarfs later than m3 . among those planets ,",
    "the transiting planets with @xmath225 are only gj 1214b , kepler-445c , and k2 - 28b .",
    "we note that their hosts are all metal - rich stars , which is in marked contrast to the metal poor hosts , kepler-42 , kepler-446 , and gj 1132 , having only earth - sized ( or sub - earth - sized ) planets",
    ". the occurrence rate calculated by @xcite could contain @xmath226-dependent systematic errors in the stellar ( and thus planet ) radii , arising from the adopted models which become unreliable for lower @xmath226 . with more samples as presented here , one can discuss the statistical property of planets around cooler m dwarfs more accurately .    with the relatively bright host star in the near infrared and moderate transit depth ,",
    "k2 - 28  is a good target for future follow - up studies .",
    "it is particularly tempting to compare k2 - 28b with another well - studied super - earth / mini - neptune , gj 1214b , in terms of atmospheric characteriztions . using the semi - major axis of @xmath227 au and k2 - 28 s radius and effective temperature in table [ hyo1 ] , we find that k2 - 28b happens to receive almost an equivalent insolation from its host star as gj 1214b ( incident energy fluxes @xmath228 for k2 - 28b and @xmath229 for gj 1214b , respectively ) .",
    "@xcite conducted a spectro - photometry with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , and as a result of analyzing 12 transits of gj 1214b , they achieved a precision of @xmath230 ppm for the transit depth in the individual spectroscopic channel between @xmath231 m . since the transit depth variation against wavelength scales as @xmath232 , where @xmath27 is the scale height , this variation for k2 - 28  as a function of wavelength would be @xmath233 that for gj 1214b . if one conducts a similar observation for k2 - 28to the one conducted by @xcite , observing the same number of transits with hst , we expect a precision of @xmath234 ppm for the transit depth measurement on the assumption that the uncertainty is dominated by the photon - limited shot noise ( @xmath235 mag and transit duration of @xmath236 minutes ) .",
    "this level of precision is sufficient to confirm or rule out the atmospheres dominated by hydrogen or methane , for which the scale height equal to gj 1214b would lead to @xmath237 ppm and @xmath238 ppm in variation amplitudes , respectively . ruling out the water- or carbon - dioxide - dominated atmospheres ( @xmath11 ppm and @xmath239 ppm , respectively ) could be challenging , but increasing the number of observed transits will help .",
    "searching for additional planets in the system is also important to understand the architecture of planetary systems around mid - m dwarfs .",
    "@xcite showed that a significant fraction ( @xmath240 ) of mid - m dwarfs hosts multiple planets within 10 days .",
    "concerning k2 - 28 , we could not find evidence of another transiting planet in our bls analysis .",
    "the sparse sampling of the k2 data during the transit makes it complicated to search for possible transit timing variations ( ttvs ) , but further intensive ground - based transit follow - ups would find or at least be able to put a constraint on the presence of additional bodies . while k2 - 28  is faint in the optical , it is relatively bright in the nir ( @xmath241 mag ) , and thus is likely within the reach of existing and planned nir radial velocity instruments ( e.g. , ird , carmenes , spirou , hpf ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
