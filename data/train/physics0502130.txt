    "<S> we report a detailed experimental study of vector modulation instability in highly birefringent optical fibers in the anomalous dispersion regime . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the observed instability is mainly induced by vacuum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the detuning of the spectral peaks agrees with linear perturbation analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the exact shape of the spectrum is well reproduced by numerical integration of stochastic nonlinear schrdinger equations describing quantum propagation .    in birefringent silica fibers , </S>",
    "<S> stable propagation of a monochromatic wave can be inhibited by a nonlinear process called _ vector _ modulation instability ( v - mi ) in both dispersion regimes ( normal or anomalous).@xcite this contrasts with the _ scalar _ modulation instability ( s - mi ) that does not require birefringence but can only arise in the anomalous dispersion regime ( at least when second order dispersion dominates@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> two limits , those of weak and strong birefringence , are amenable to relatively simple analytical study.@xcite these predictions have been confirmed experimentally in a number of cases,@xcite particularly in the normal dispersion regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the only experimental investigation of v - mi in the anomalous dispersion regime that we are aware of is a recent unsuccessful attempt using photonic crystal fibers.@xcite here we report what is to our knowledge the first experimental study of v - mi in strongly birefringent silica fibers in the anomalous dispersion regime . </S>",
    "<S> we also carry out a very precise comparison between experimental results and the predictions of numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> modulation instabilities ( mi ) can be induced by classical noise present initially together with the pump beam . </S>",
    "<S> but mi can also arise spontaneously through amplification of vacuum fluctuations.@xcite in practice classical input noise and vacuum fluctuations compete for inducing mi . the experiment reported here </S>",
    "<S> is carried out in the regime where the quantum noise is dominant .    </S>",
    "<S> elsewhere,@xcite we present an unified approach to the problem of scalar and vector mi based on the _ stochastic nonlinear schrdinger equations _ ( snlse ) which generalizes the work of ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is particularly well suited for numerical simulations in complex situations where classical noise and vacuum fluctuations act together , where the pump is depleted , or where the higher order harmonics of mi appear . in previous work on modulation instability , </S>",
    "<S> comparison between theory and experiment has generally been limited to noting that the frequency at which the maximum gain of the mi occurs is correctly predicted . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that there is excellent agreement between the experimental results and the numerical integration of the snlse . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the detailed shape of the output spectrum can be predicted in detail , even in the case where higher order harmonics appear ( which can not be predicted by linear perturbation theory ) . to our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time experimental and theoretical studies of mi are compared in such detail . </S>",
    "<S> a related work is the comparison between theory and experiment for rf noise measurements reported in ref .  .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental setup is reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a q switched laser ( cobolt tango ) that produces pulses at 1536 nm , with a 3.55  ns full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) duration @xmath0 and a 2.5  khz repetition rate @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the gaussian spectral shape of the laser has been characterized using a fabry - perot interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath2  ghz fwhm spectral width is slightly larger than expected in the fourier transform limit . </S>",
    "<S> the pump power is adjusted using variable neutral density filters ( nd ) . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the injected mean power @xmath3 at the end of the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the peak power @xmath4 is relied to the mean power according to the relation : @xmath5 a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs1 ) ensures the pump pulse is linearly polarized . </S>",
    "<S> a half - wave plate is used to tune the angle @xmath6 between the pump polarization direction and the principal axes of the fiber . a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs2 ) </S>",
    "<S> can be used in order to observe the field components polarized along the fast or slow axes separately . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , spectra are recorded using an optical spectral analyser ( osa ) . in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> we use the fibercore hb1250p optical fiber . the fiber length @xmath7  m , the group - velocity dispersion ( gvd ) parameter @xmath8   ps@xmath9  km@xmath10 and the group - velocity mismatch parameter @xmath11  fs  m@xmath10 have been measured by independent methods ( only significant digits have been indicated ) . note that the accuracy on the value of @xmath12 is poor compared to the standards . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the interferometric method @xcite that we used turned out to be difficult to implement with a birefringent fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the group - velocity mismatch parameter @xmath13 is deduced from the walk - off between pulses propagating on the principal axes of the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the fiber length @xmath14 is deduced from a measurement of the pulse time of flight . </S>",
    "<S> the other important parameters of the fiber , and a more accurate estimation of @xmath12 , can be inferred from mi spectral peaks positions , as explained further .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f2 ] shows a typical spectrum at the fiber output when the angle @xmath6 is set to 45 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> the fast and slow polarization components have been separated using pbs2 and their spectra recorded successively . </S>",
    "<S> the plot clearly exhibits two v - mi peaks at 1511.4  nm and 1561.4  nm that are polarized along the fast and slow axes respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it also shows s - mi peaks at 1530.0  nm and 1541.9  nm , with first harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with v - mi , s - mi is equally generated on both principal axes . by polarizing the input field along the fast or slow axes , we have observed that v - mi disappears and that the amplitude of the s - mi peaks increases dramatically ( figure not shown ) .    according to linear perturbation analysis , </S>",
    "<S> the angular frequency shifts from the pump of the mi peaks are given by @xmath15 \\label{mis}\\\\ \\delta\\omega_{v - mi}^{2}&\\approx&\\left(\\frac{\\delta\\beta_1}{|\\beta_2|}\\right)^{2}\\left[1+\\frac{2\\gamma p_0}{|\\beta_2|}\\left(\\frac{|\\beta_2|}{\\delta\\beta_1}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\label{miv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for s - mi and v - mi peaks respectively . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 stands for the kerr nonlinearity parameter of the fiber . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f3 ] shows the evolution of the spectrum of light emerging from the fiber when the pump power is increased . </S>",
    "<S> using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mis ] ) and ( [ miv ] ) , the ratios @xmath17  ( rad )  thz and @xmath18  ( rad )  thz@xmath9  w@xmath10 where deduced from these measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the first ratio and the measured value of @xmath13 permits to infer that @xmath19  ps@xmath9  km@xmath10 , which is compatible with the independently measured value . from the second ratio </S>",
    "<S> , we deduce that @xmath20  w@xmath10  km@xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> the exponential growth of the mi peaks and harmonics is clearly apparent on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f3 ] . from these measurements </S>",
    "<S> we deduce that the ratio between the maximum gain of the v - mi and of the s - mi is 0.67@xmath21 , in good agreement with the theoretical value @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the ratio between the maximum gain of the 1st harmonic and of the s - mi is 1.88@xmath23 , in good agreement with the theoretical value@xcite of 2 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now focus on the quantitative comparison between experimental spectral amplitudes and those predicted by the snlse model for spontaneous ( or vacuum - fluctuations induced ) modulation instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison makes sense because the exact shape of the spectrum , and in particular the relative intensities of the modulation instability peaks and harmonics , is very strongly dependent on the initial noise and pump peak power . </S>",
    "<S> experimental and computed spectra are plotted together in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f4 ] . in the simulations we used the parameters deduced from experimental mi peaks positions ( see above ) , but in order to obtain a good fit we had to increase the peak pump power by 5% with respect to that deduced from the measurements using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ power ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we are not sure of the origin of this discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> it could either be due to a systematic error in the measured values of @xmath24 , to an error in the experimental measure of @xmath13 , to the fact that the experimental pulses are not exactly fourier - transform limited , or to some classical noise photons ( for instance due to raman scattering in the fiber ) that are added to vacuum fluctuations and slightly speed up the instability . in any case </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy is small enough to confidently conclude that in our experiment the mi is mainly induced by vacuum - fluctuations . indeed with this small adjustment </S>",
    "<S> the experimental mi spectra are very well reproduced by numerical integration of the snlse model .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we report what is to our knowledge the first experimental observation of spontaneous vector modulation instability in a highly birefringent silica fiber in the anomalous dispersion regime . </S>",
    "<S> the pump power dependence of the detuning of both scalar and vector side - bands , as well as their polarizations , agree with linear perturbation theory when the pump depletion is small . </S>",
    "<S> we have also obtained very good agreement between the experimental spectra and those obtained by numerical integration of the snlse derived from the quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> this is to our knowledge the first time that theoretical and experimental spectra are compared in such quantitative detail . </S>",
    "<S> this very good agreement between the two approaches proves that the modulation instability that we observed was truly spontaneous , in the sense that it mainly results from the amplification of vacuum - fluctuations . </S>"
