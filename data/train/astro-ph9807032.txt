    "our method of `` direct '' spectral analysis is described in section  3 , and results are presented in section  4 . in section  5",
    "we discuss evidence that sn  1991 t was too luminous to be a chandrasekhar  mass explosion , and suggest that it probably was a substantially super  chandraskhar explosion resulting from the merger of two white dwarfs .",
    "a general discussion appears in section 6 .",
    "filippenko et  al ( 1992 ) presented optical spectra obtained from @xmath0 to @xmath1 days .",
    "( thoughout this paper , epochs are in days with respect to the date of maximum light , 1991 april 28 ; lira et  al .",
    "they showed that although the premaximum optical spectra did not resemble those of any other supernova , beginning near maximum light the usual sn  ia lines of intermediate ",
    "mass elements slowly developed , and months after explosion the iron  dominated spectrum appeared almost identical to that of a typical sn  ia .",
    "they identified the two strong features in the premaximum optical spectrum with the fe  iii @xmath2 and @xmath3 multiplets and concluded that the composition of the outer layers was dominated by iron  group elements .",
    "given their inferred composition structure of a thin layer of intermediate ",
    "mass elements sandwiched between inner and outer regions dominated by iron ",
    "peak elements , they favored a double  detonation model ( the nearly complete incineration of a mildly sub  chandrasekhar  mass white dwarf by detonation waves propagating inward and outward from the base of an accumulated helium layer ) for the origin of sn  1991 t .",
    "they noted that it was odd , then , that in their @xmath4 day spectrum an absorption near 7550  that is ordinarily attributed to o  i @xmath5 seemed to be present at its usual strength .",
    "ruiz  lapuente et  al ( 1992 ) presented optical spectra obtained on seven consecutive nights from @xmath6 to @xmath7 days .",
    "they too identified the fe  iii lines , as well as lines of ni  iii , and they too concluded that the outer layers had undergone complete burning to iron  peak elements .",
    "they supported that conclusion by presenting synthetic spectra based on approximate nlte calculations , for the time ",
    "dependent nickel  cobalt  iron composition that results from the radioactive decay of initially pure @xmath8ni . as they noted , though , the lines in their synthetic spectra tended to be stronger than the observed lines .",
    "their spectra did not extend late enough in time for them to encounter the oxygen line .",
    "they did , however , discuss another puzzle .",
    "their spectra showed no evidence for the high velocities of the outer layers that would follow from complete burning to iron ",
    "peak elements .",

    "oxygen envelope associated with a merger of two white dwarfs .",
    "phillips et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) presented optical spectra obtained from @xmath6 to @xmath9 days . from the appearance of the spectra they concluded that the abundances of silicon , sulfur , and calcium in the outer layers were unusually low , but they did not specify what was present in their place .",
    "jeffery et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) carried out parameterized synthetic ",
    "spectrum calculations , based on the sobolev approximation , an approximate radiative  equilibrium temperature distribution , and full lte , including a planckian rather than a resonance scattering source function .",

    "deflagration model w7 ( nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi 1984 ; thielemann , nomoto , & yokoi 1986 ) , by trial and error , to get reasonable fits to observed optical ( and some iue near  ultraviolet ) spectra obtained at @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 days .",
    "the adopted composition ( displayed in their figure  7 ) was complex , and not simply dominated in the outer layers by iron  peak elements .",
    "it was like that of model w7 for ejection velocities less than 8500 ; heavily modified between 8500 and 14,400 in favor of iron ",
    "peak elements at the expense of intermediate ",
    "mass elements ; heavily modified between 14,400 and 21,000 in favor of both intermediate  mass and iron ",
    "peak elements at the expense of carbon ; and primarily carbon and oxygen above 21,000 . noting that somewhat weaker fe",
    "iii lines might have gone unrecognized in previous studies of other sne  ia , they suggested that although the composition structure was unusual the explosion history of sn  1991 t probably was not fundamentally different from that of a normal sn  ia .",
    "mazzali , danziger , & turatto ( 1995 ) also carried out parameterized spectrum calculations , using a monte carlo code and a resonance scattering source function .",
    "they were restricted to using a homogeneous composition above the photosphere at each of the seven epochs considered .",
    "for each epoch they used a combination of a mixed w7 composition and the time ",
    "dependent @xmath8ni  decay composition .",
    "they concluded that an unusually high temperature was partly responsible for the weakness of the lines of singly ionized intermediate ",
    "mass elements , but also that iron  peak elements dominated the composition above 13,000 .",
    "they favored a `` late  detonation '' ( yamaoka et  al .",
    "1992 ) explosion mechanism in a chandrasekhar  mass white dwarf for the origin of sn  1991 t .",
    "( mazzali et  al referred to it as a `` delayed detonation '' , but by custom that term is used to refer a class of models that , unlike the late detonations , do not synthesize @xmath8ni in the outer layers ; e.g. , khokhlov , mller , & hflich 1993 ) .",
    "nugent et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) calculated detailed nlte spectra using the phoenix code [ cf .",
    "hauschildt and baron 1998 , and references therein ] , for a fixed composition ( w7 mixed above 8000 , with titaniium enhanced by a factor of 10 ) and a series of temperatures .",
    "they found that their series of synthetic spectra gave a good account of many of the spectral differences among sne  ia , from the peculiar , cool , `` weak '' sn  1991bg , through the normal sne  ia , to the peculiar , warm , `` strong '' sn  1991 t .",
    "this showed that to a certain extent the differences between the spectra of sne  ia are due to temperature differences , and confirmed that in sn  1991 t a high temperature can enhance the fe  iii and si  iii lines and weaken the lines of singly ionized elements .",
    "still , the temperature differences among sne  ia presumably are caused by differences in the amounts of ejected @xmath8ni , and differences in the composition structures certainly are to be expected .",
    "in this paper we use the fast , parameterized , supernova spectrum  synthesis code synow to make a `` direct '' analysis ( fisher et  al .",
    "1997 ) of spectra of sn  1991 t .",
    "the goal is to study line identifications and determine intervals of ejection velocity within which the presence of lines of various ions are detected , without initially adopting any particular composition structure .",
    "the composition and velocity constraints that we obtain with synow then can provide guidance to those who compute hydrodynamical explosion models and to those who carry out computationally intensive nlte spectrum modeling .",
    "the synow code was described briefly by fisher et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) and in detail by fisher ( 1998 ) . in our work on sn  1991 t we have made extensive use of the paper by hatano et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which presented plots of lte sobolev line optical depths versus temperature for six different compositions that might be expected to be encountered in supernovae , and which presented synow optical spectra for 45 individual ions that can be regarded as candidates for producing identifiable spectral features in supernova spectra .",
    "fisher et  al . (",
    "1997 ) concentrated on a high quality spectrum of the normal type  ia sn  1990n that was obtained by leibundgut  et  al .",
    "( 1991 ) at @xmath13 days .",
    "fisher et  al . suggested that at this very early phase an absorption feature observed near 6040 , which previously had been attributed to moderately blueshifted si  ii @xmath14 , actually was produced by highly blueshifted ( @xmath15 ) c  ii @xmath16 , indicating the presence of an outer high  velocity carbon ",
    "rich layer in sn 1990n . in this paper",
    "we suggest that sn 1991 t also contained an outer carbon  rich layer , but extending to lower velocity than in sn  1990n .",
    "we have studied spectra of sn  1991 t ranging from @xmath6 days to @xmath17 days . for comparison with",
    "each observed spectrum we have calculated a large number of synthetic spectra with various values of the fitting parameters .",
    "these include : @xmath18 , the temperature of the underlying blackbody continuum ; @xmath19 , the excitation temperature ; @xmath20 , the velocity of matter at the photosphere ; and @xmath21 , the maximum ejection velocity . for each ion that is introduced",
    ", the optical depth of a reference line also is a fitting parameter , with the optical depths of the other lines of the ion are calculated assuming boltzmann excitation at @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , we can introduce restrictions on the velocity interval within which an ion is present ; when the minimum velocity assigned to an ion is greater than the velocity at the photosphere , the line is said to be detached from the photosphere .",
    "the radial dependence of the line optical depths is taken to be exponential with e  folding velocity @xmath22 km s@xmath23 ( with one exception to be discussed in section 4.2 ) and the line source function is taken to be that of resonance scattering .",
    "the most interesting fitting parameters are @xmath20 , which as expected , decreases with time , and the individual ion velocity restrictions , which constrain the composition structure .",
    "in this section we present comparisons of synthetic spectra with observed spectra at several selected epochs , to illustrate how we reach our conclusions about the composition structure of the ejecta .",
    "the premaximum and postmaximum spectra are discussed separately , because the the former were so peculiar while the latter became increasingly normal .      in the premaximum spectra",
    "only two features have obvious identifications : two strong features produced by the fe  iii @xmath2 and @xmath3 multiplets .",
    "figure  1 compares a @xmath6 day observed spectrum to a synthetic spectrum that has @xmath24 and @xmath25 k. the optical depth of the fe  iii reference line and the velocity at the photosphere have been chosen such that the @xmath3 multiplet gives a reasonable fit to the strong p cygni feature near 5000 .",
    "similarly , the optical depth of the reference line of ni  iii has been chosen to give a reasonable fit to the weaker absorption near 5300 ; then , in the synthetic spectrum , ni  iii also is responsible for the weak absorption near 4700 .",
    "we consider the presence of ni  iii lines in the observed spectrum to be probable .",
    "the diagnostic value of a spectral feature is not simply proportional to its strength .",
    "a weak feature in the premaximum spectra that is of special interest to us is the broad , shallow absorption near 6300 , which definitely is a real feature because it can be seen in almost all of the spectra obtained by filippenko et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , ruiz  lapuente et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) and phillips et al .",
    "( 1992 ) earlier than @xmath26 days ; this feature was not mentioned in the previous discussions of the sn  1991 t spectra . as shown in figure  1 , c",
    "ii @xmath16 can account for this feature , and in spite of searching for a plausible alternative with the help of the plots of hatano et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we have none to offer .",
    "figure  2 compares a @xmath27 day observed spectrum to a synthetic spectrum that has @xmath28 and @xmath25 k. the two strong fe  iii features are fit reasonably well , and ni  iii and ni  ii probably account for some of the other observed features .",
    "additional ions of iron ",
    "peak elements would need to be introduced to account for the observed flux deficiency at @xmath29  .",
    "the narrow absorption near 4400  is well fit by the si  iii @xmath30 multiplet , which is the strongest optical multiplet of si  iii and was identified in sn  1991 t by jeffery et al .",
    "note that at this phase , there is a weak absorption near 6200 , rather than the 6300  of earlier phases .",
    "in general , supernova absorption features shift redward as the photosphere recedes with respect to the matter , or they remain unshifted if the line has become detached .",
    "a blueward shift of an absorption is almost a sure sign that a new line is beginning to make a significant contribution . in this case",
    "the new line is very likely si  ii @xmath14 , which in normal sne  ia is very strong at this phase .",
    "( in the synthetic spectrum , lines of ni  ii and fe  iii also are affecting this feature . )    from the premaximum spectra we infer that iron , silicon , and probably nickel were present above 10,000 , with iron being detected up to 20,000 . if the nickel identifications are correct , then freshly synthesized iron ",
    "peak elements were present in these outer layers . carbon seems to have been present down to at least 15,000 . between @xmath6 and @xmath27 days ,",
    "the red absorption feature apparently transformed from mainly c  ii forming above about 15,000 to mainly si  ii forming above 10,000 .",
    "a very careful study of a good series of spectra obtained within this time interval might better determine the minimum velocity at which c  ii was present . if the c  ii line became detached before the si  ii line made its appearance , the observed absorption minimum whould have remained constant at the detachment velocity until the development of the si  ii line started to cause a shift to the blue .",
    "figure  3 shows a @xmath4 day observed spectrum . by this time",
    "the spectrum had begun to look much less peculiar .",
    "the synthetic spectrum has @xmath31 and @xmath32 k. the synthetic feature near 5000  is now a blend of fe  iii and fe  ii lines .",
    "the observed s  ii and si",
    "ii features are weaker and narrower than in normal sne  ia . in the synthetic spectrum of the top panel ,",
    "a maximum velocity of 12,000 for s  ii lines has been introduced to fit the absorptions near 5300 and 5500 , and a maximum velocity of 15,000 has been used to fit the si  ii absorption near 6200  .",
    "the lower panel shows how the fit degrades when these maximum velocities are not used .",
    "the observed spectrum that appears in figures  4 and 5 was obtained by meikle et  al .",
    "( unpublished ) at @xmath17 days .",
    "the synthetic spectra have @xmath33 and @xmath32 k. the upper panel of figure  4 shows that resonance scattering by permitted lines of just three ions  fe  ii , ca  ii , and na  i  can give a reasonable account of most of the features in the observed spectrum , although the height of the synthetic peaks in the blue indicate that the synthetic spectrum is underblanketed . in the synthetic spectrum na  i and ca",
    "ii are detached at 9000 , and an abrupt decrease in the fe ii line optical depths , by a factor of 10 , has been introduced at 10,000 .",
    "this is inferred to be a measure of the maximum velocity of the iron ",
    "peak core .",
    "the structure of the synthetic spectrum near 5000  is quite sensitive to the velocity of the fe  ii line optical depth discontinuity ( fisher 1998 ) .",
    "the major shortcoming in the upper panel of figure  4 is that the broad minimum observed near 7000  is not reproduced by the synthetic spectrum .",
    "( the weak synthetic absorptions in the vicinity are from fe  ii . )",
    "a possible identification for this feature is [ o  ii ] @xmath34 ( fisher  1998 , hatano et  al .",
    "1998 ) . for a forbidden transition",
    "the natural first approximation to the source function would be the planck function evaluated at the local electron temperature , but instead of introducing a whole new fitting function involving the radial dependence of the electron temperature , we have simply retained the resonance scattering source function . in the lower panel of figure  4",
    "the [ o  ii ] feature is calculated with a line optical depth that is detached at 10,000 , where @xmath35 , and has a shallow radial gradient ( @xmath36 ) such that @xmath37 at the maximum [ o  ii ] velocity of 25,000 .",
    "the upper panel of figure  5 , which is like the upper panel of figure  4 but with the [ o  ii ] feature included in the synthetic spectrum , looks better than the upper panel of figure  4 .",
    "the lower panel of figure  5 shows how the fit degrades when na  i is not detached , the discontinuity in the fe  ii line optical depths is not introduced , and the upper and lower velocity limits on [ o  ii ] are dropped .    from a spectroscopic point of view",
    "the [ o  ii ] identification is attractive and plausible .",
    "moreover , kirshner et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) discussed the velocity interval in which the o  i @xmath5 line could be detected in the early spectra of a small sample of well observed sne  ia . for sn",
    "1991 t they estimated that the o  i line had a significant optical depth from at least as low as 9000 to at least as high as 19,000 , which is not inconsistent with what we are using for [ o  ii ] .",
    "but the mass and associated kinetic energy of the oxygen that would be required to produce a significant [ o  ii ] line optical depth , at such high velocities and at this fairly late phase , appear to be high . for this feature , with its very low transition probability ,",
    "just producing a uniform line optical depth of 0.2 requires    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the maximum velocity in units of 25,000 , @xmath40 is the time since explosion in units of 77 days ( allowing for a rise time to maximum of 18 days ) , and @xmath41 is the fraction of all oxygen that is in the lower level of the transition .",
    "it is possible that essentially all of the oxygen is singly ionized at this phase , but @xmath41 must be significantly less than unity because the lower level of the transition is 3.3  ev above the ground level of singly ionized oxygen .",
    "( the ground level of the transition is , at least , the metastable lowest level of the doublets , the true ground level of singly ionized oxygen being a quartet . )",
    "we have no plausible alternative to offer for the 7000  minumum .",
    "if it is not an absorption feature at all , then the continuum must be at a level that is considerably lower than we have adopted to obtain the fits shown in the top panels of figures  4 and 5 .",
    "we suspect that the [ o  ii ] identification is correct , but in view of the mass and energy problem the maximum [ o  ii ] velocity may need to be somewhat lower than the 25,000 that we have used .      in paper",
    "i we presented evidence for c  ii in sn  1990n at @xmath15 km s@xmath23 .",
    "it is thought that when sne  ia are arranged in a sequence from powerful events like sn  1991 t to weak ones like sn  1991bg , sn  1990n belongs on the powerful side ( e.g. , phillips 1992 ; nugent et  al .",
    "one might then expect events that are weaker than sn 1990n to have unburned carbon extending down to velocities lower than 26,000 km s@xmath23 , and our synow studies of other sne  ia suggest that this generally is the case ( fisher 1998 ) .",
    "similarly , one might expect events like sn  1991 t that are thought to be stronger than sn  1990n to have a minimum velocity of carbon that is higher than 26,000 .",
    "but in sn  1991 t we find evidence for c  ii moving at least as slow as about 15,000 km s@xmath23 . at the same time , we find evidence that the iron ",
    "peak core of sn  1991 t extended out to velocities at least as high as in sn  1990n and other sne ia .",
    "independently , mazzali et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) list outer velocities of the iron core for 14 sne  ia , inferred from nebular  phase spectra , and they find that sn  1991 t has the highest velocity in their sample .",
    "thus sn  1991 t seems to have had both slower unburned carbon and a faster iron ",
    "peak core than sn  1990n , with its intermediate ",
    "mass elements being confined to an unusually narrower velocity interval .",
    "figure  6 shows the velocity at the photosphere as a function of time .",
    "the pause in the velocity decrease , around 10,000 , presumably reflects an increase in the density or the opacity near the outer edge of the iron  peak core .",
    "our combined constraints on the composition structure are shown in figure  7 .",
    "the inferred structure is not like any hydrodynamical model that has been published .",
    "a speculation about the cause of the peculiar composition structure of sn  1991 t will be offered in section  5 , after the implication of the high luminosity of sn  1991 t is considered in the next section .",
    "ngc 4527 , the parent galaxy of sn  1991 t , is in the southern extension of the virgo cluster complex . according to the nearby galaxies catalogue ( tully 1988 ) it is a member of the same small group of galaxies ( group 11 4 in tully s notation ) as ngc 4536 and ngc 4496 , the parent galaxies of the normal type ia sne 1981b and 1960f .",

    "the peak luminosity of a type ia supernova can be written ( arnett 1982 , branch 1992 )    @xmath62    where @xmath63 , the instantaneous radioactivity luminosity per unit nickel mass at the time of maximum light , is a known function of the rise time @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the mass of ejected @xmath8ni , and @xmath66 is dimensionless and of order unity . for normal sne ia , such as sn 1981b , characteristic values of @xmath67 , @xmath68 days , and @xmath69 ( e.g. , hflich & khokhlov 1996 ; branch et  al . 1997 ) give @xmath70 ergs s@xmath23 .",
    "this corresponds to a bolometric absolute magnitude @xmath71 , a little brighter than , but not inconsistent with , the value implied by the cepheid distance and the adopted extinction .    at first glance",
    "one might think that sufficient overluminosity of sn 1991 t with respect to sn 1981b could be achieved with a chandrasekhar mass , just by allowing the nickel mass to approach the chandrasekhar mass in sn 1991 t ( i.e. , @xmath72 , and we have estimated that sn  1991 t was more luminous than sn  1981b by a factor of 2.4 ) . however , there are severe problems with this simple picture , in which nearly all of the ejected mass of sn 1991 t is initially in the form of @xmath8ni .",
    "( 1 ) spectral lines formed by elements other than nickel , cobalt , and iron show that the initial composition of sn  1991 t was not just @xmath8ni .",
    "( 2 ) no hydrodynamical models of chandasekhar  mass explosions produce just @xmath8ni .",
    "even the pure detonation model of khokhlov et al .",
    "( 1993 ) produced only @xmath73 of @xmath8ni , with the rest of the mass being in the form of other iron  peak isotopes .",
    "( 3 ) a rapid expansion of the ejecta caused by the high kinetic energy per gram , together with the prompt escape of gamma rays emitted by @xmath8ni in the outer layers , would make the light curve too fast , and with gammas escaping the value of @xmath66 would be low . for example , for the detonation model of khokhlov",
    "( 1993 ) , hflich & khokhlov ( 1996 ) calculated @xmath74 ( in their notation it is @xmath75 ) .",
    "( 5 ) the optical and gamma  ray luminosities depend on distance in the same way . from the optical brightness of sn 1991 t and the lack of detection of gamma rays by lichti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and leising et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the latter authors conclude that  some way of producing optically brighter but gamma  ray fainter supernovae [ compared to sn ia models in the literature ] is required to explain sn 1991 t \" .",
    "a chandrasekhar  mass explosion that contained nearly a chandrasekhar mass of @xmath8ni would have a _ low _ ratio of optical and gamma  ray luminosities .",
    "if sn 1991 t is at the same distance as sne 1981b and 1960f then it is unlikely that its luminosity can be explained in terms of a chandrasekhar mass ejection .",
    "if the luminosity of sn  1991 t was too high to be explained in terms of a chandrarsekhar mass ejection , the only recourse would seem to be to appeal to the explosion of a super  chandrasekhar product of the merger of two white dwarfs .",
    "the question of whether mergers of white dwarfs actually can produce explosions is not yet settled ( e.g. , mochkovitch , guerrero , & segretain 1997 ) .",
    "an attractive recent suggestion was that of iben ( 1997 ) , who noted that because tidal torques will spin up the premerger white dwarfs to rotate in near synchronism with the orbital motion , huge shear forces will arise at the onset of the merger .",
    "if both white dwarfs ignite prior to or during the merger , owing to shear and tidal heating , or if the ignition of one of the white dwarfs then provokes the ignition of the other , this might be a way to get not only a super  chandrasekhar mass ejection , but even a super  chandrasekhar mass of @xmath8ni if such should prove to be required . getting a super  chandrasekhar mass of @xmath8ni out of a thermonuclear explosion was difficult to envision before iben s suggestion",
    ". it must be noted , though , that in the first calculations of tidal heating during a merger , it failed by a narrow margin to cause carbon to ignite ( iben & tutukov 1998 ) .",
    "it is interesting that on the basis of their population  synthesis studies , tutukov & yungelson ( 1994 ) predict that for `` young '' mergers , those that occur within 300 myr of star formation , the average combined mass is substantially super  chandrasekhar , typically about @xmath76 ( see their figure  4 ) .",
    "recall that sn 1991 t appears to have occurred near a spiral arm .",
    "preliminary indications are that the several other events resembling sn  1991 t that have been discovered in recent years also tend to be associated with star forming regions and/or to be significantly extinguished by dust ( a.  v.  filippenko 1998 , personal communication ; p.",
    "garnavich 1998 , personal communication ) .",
    "sn  1991t  type events may be from a younger population than most sne  ia .",
    "it also is interesting that ruiz ",
    "lapuente et al . (",
    "1992 ) discuss the possible detection of a narrow circumstellar line of o i @xmath77 in their earliest spectrum of sn 1991 t .",
    "searching for narrow circumstellar lines of hydrogen , helium , carbon , or oxygen is one the best ways to probe the composition of the donor star in the binary progenitor system of a sn ia ( branch et al .",
    "no signs of circumstellar interaction , and no clear detections of narrow circumstellar lines of hydrogen or helium have been found in _ any _ sn  ia .",
    "the proposition that sn 1991 t was the result of a super  chandrasekhar merger is consistent with the findings of hflich & khokhlov ( 1996 ) , who calculated light curves for a variety of sn ia hydrodynamical models and found that the slow light curve of sn 1991 t was best fit by models of khokhlov et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) that had a super  chandrasekhar ejecta and/or substantial amounts of unburned carbon and oxygen in their outermost layers .",
    "the particular models that hflich & khkokhlov cited as best fitting the light curve have a peak @xmath78 , which is not luminous enough for sn 1991 t .",
    "however , in their models the underlying explosion was the detonation of only 1.2 @xmath79 , inside low  density carbon  oxygen envelopes of 0.2 , 0.4 , and 0.6 @xmath79 .",
    "if the central explosion had been the detonation of a chandrasekhar mass the peak would have been brighter .    in a very general sense ,",
    "the composition structure expected of a merger explosion might resemble the composition structure that has been inferred for sn  1991 t ( cf .",
    "lapuente et  al .",
    "an unusually strong explosion produces a high  mass , high  velocity iron ",
    "peak core surrounded by an unusually small mass of intermediate ",
    "mass elements ; this encounters a surrounding low ",
    "density mass of carbon and oxygen which decelerates the intermediate ",
    "mass elements and forces them into a narrow velocity interval .",
    "the super  chandraskhar models of khokhlov et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) had this sort of composition structure , but the minimum velocity of unburned carbon was lower than 10,000 , a value which is lower than we infer from the spectra . in this respect ,",
    "too , replacing the 1.2 @xmath80 core with a chandrasekhar mass would be a step in the right direction .",
    "none of this explains the presence of iron - peak elements at higher velocity than the intermediate ",
    "mass elements , or the possible coexistence in velocity space of iron  peak elements and unburned carbon .",
    "eventually , only multidimensional hydrodynamical studies of the merger process can tell us whether this is possible .",
    "it should be noted that liu , jeffery & schultz ( 1997b ) used a steady  state model of ionization and thermal structure to calculate early nebular ",
    "phase spectra for comparison with observed spectra obtained hundreds of days after the explosion .",
    "although they favored a _",
    "sub_chandrasekhar mass ejection for sn  1991 t , the mass was higher than they favored for normal sne  ia ( liu , jeffery , & schultz 1997a ) .",
    "the argument that sn  1991 t was super  chandrasekhar depends , of course , on our assumption that sn  1991 t is at the same distance as sne  1981b and 1960f . a cepheid  based determination of the distance to ngc 4527 , although perhaps not easy for such a dusty , inclined galaxy , is vital to check on this assumption .",
