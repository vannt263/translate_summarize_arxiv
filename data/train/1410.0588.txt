    "maximal functions are a central object in harmonic analysis ; conversely , harmonic analysis is built up from trigonometric functions .",
    "we were motivated by the simple question whether a maximal function is able to recognize a trigonometric function in any particular way .",
    "we focus on the centered hardy - littlewood maximal function on the real line @xmath9 classical results are the embedding @xmath10 , where the sharp constant is known @xcite , as well as the embedding @xmath11 for @xmath12 . the wealth of theory developed around maximal functions can no longer be succinctly summarized : we refer to the book of stein @xcite for the classical theory and a survey of wolff @xcite on the kakeya problem .",
    "usual questions around maximal functions are concerned with their size : since @xmath14 in all lebesgue points , it is of interest to understand mapping properties in @xmath15 spaces .",
    "our question goes in an orthogonal direction : how complicated is the dynamical behavior of the maximal intervals ?",
    "the question is not well - posed because there might be more than one interval centered at @xmath16 over which the average value of the function coincides with the maximal function : in these cases , we opt for taking the smallest such interval .",
    "formally , we define the length function @xmath17 associated to a periodic function @xmath18 by @xmath19 where the integral is to be understood as the point evaluation if @xmath20 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath21 is well - defined and finite for periodic functions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the situation , where for all @xmath7 both @xmath13 and @xmath22 are either 0 or a fixed positive real number and to show that this characterizes the trigonometric function .",
    "this theorem may be understood as a characterization of trigonometric functions by means of a dynamical aspect of the hardy - littlewood maximal function .",
    "it seems to have surprisingly little to do with traditional characterizations involving geometry , power series , differential equations or spectral theory .",
    "indeed , we failed to find a slick reduction to any of the classical characterizations and ended up needing tools from transcendental number theory .",
    "let @xmath2 be a periodic function and @xmath3 .",
    "there exists a positive number @xmath23 such that the averaging operator @xmath5 has a critical point in @xmath6 for every @xmath16 if and only if @xmath8    theorem 1 is the strongest statement in this paper ; it is relatively easy to deduce the following statement , which formulates everything in terms of the complexity of the maximal intervals .",
    "let @xmath2 be a periodic function and @xmath3 .",
    "then @xmath24 if and only if @xmath8    we emphasize that we do not even know whether the statement remains true if the constant 2 is replaced by a larger positive integer ( but conjecture that it does ) .",
    "another way of stating theorem 2 is as follows : suppose the periodic function @xmath25 does not change sign and that both @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be computed by checking the average over an interval of fixed interval and comparing it with point evaluation , i.e. suppose there exists a fixed number @xmath4 such that @xmath18 satisfies the equation @xmath28 and the same condition ( with the same value @xmath29 ) holds for @xmath27 , then @xmath8      perhaps the most natural first step after seeing theorem 1 would be to try a combination of differentiation and algebraic manipulations to obtain an ordinary differential equation ( with the hope of it being @xmath30 ) .",
    "as it turns out , this does not work and produces much more interesting results instead .",
    "differentiation in @xmath31 implies that @xmath32 assuming @xmath33 , this equation can now be differentiated in @xmath16 and yields @xmath34 the qualitative theory of delay differential equations is a lot more complicated than the theory of ordinary differential equations because the space of solutions is _ much _ larger ( uncountable ) : any @xmath35 function @xmath36 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}$ ] with correct boundary conditions can always be extended to a solution of the delay differential equation .",
    "however , as an easy consequence of theorem 2 , we can show that there are few periodic solutions .",
    "let @xmath23 be fixed and let @xmath37 be a solution of the delay differential equation @xmath34 if @xmath18 is periodic , then @xmath8    considering the large ( uncountable ) number of solutions , it is utterly remarkable that there are so few periodic solutions .",
    "we have not been able to locate any type of argument in the literature that would allow to prove a result of this type .",
    "we believe that many of the assumptions can be weakened .",
    "periodicity of the functions is necessary to allow the use of fourier series on which our argument is based , however , it seems natural to assume that the properties discussed could not hold for a nonperiodic function anyway .",
    "the assumption @xmath2 with @xmath3 is required at one point in the proof to enforce uniform convergence of the fourier series ; again , it seems to be an artefact of the method .",
    "we note that the condition @xmath2 with @xmath3 in our statements could always be replaced with the condition of @xmath18 having an absolutely convergent fourier series . the strongest statement",
    "we believe could to true is the following .    _",

    "it seems to indicate , in some weak sense , that fourier frequencies interact weakly ( perhaps in the sense of a @xmath40property ? ) .",
    "furthermore , it seems that if @xmath18 is given by a lacunary fourier series , then @xmath41 again in a vague sense ( small measure and a very large number of connected components ) : it could be of interest to try to understand quantitative versions of this basic intuition .",
    "one could also ask to which extent this persists in higher dimensions : in @xmath42 , if we consider the maximal function associated to axis - parallel rectangles and the natural analogue @xmath43 , then setting @xmath44 already in two dimensions , there are many natural maximal functions and it is not clear to us whether similar statements hold for any of them .",

    "numerical experiments show that the continuous case translates into the discrete setting : for generic parameters functions of the form @xmath51 seem to give rise to two - valued @xmath21 .",
    "we do not have a formal proof of this statement , it should be equivalent to a series of trigonometric inequalities that might actually be in the literature . the property is stable under small perturbations",
    "however , there also exist completely different functions with a two - valued @xmath21 : the following example was found by xiuyuan cheng ( personal communication ) .",
    "taking @xmath52 introducing a cut - off and making it periodic can yield functions with @xmath53 .",
    "this example is structurally totally different from the sine : having oscillations at scale 2 seems crucial .",
    "we do not know whether there are any solutions of other types and consider it to be a fascinating problem",
    ". a natural conjecture would be that if a periodic function @xmath48 satisfies @xmath54 and has a two - valued @xmath21 , then @xmath55 for some function @xmath56 tending to 0 as @xmath57 tends to 0 .",
    "we are not aware of any related work in this direction .",
    "our interest in the hardy - littlewood maximal function itself , however , stems from a series of recent interesting results studying fine properties of @xmath26 : since @xmath26 tries to maximize local averages , there is every reason to believe that it should decrease total variation  this turns out to be a surprisingly intricate problem .",
    "motivated by a question of kinnunen @xcite , tanaka @xcite showed for the _ uncentered _ hardy - littlewood maximal function @xmath58 that @xmath59 where the constant 2 was then improved to 1 by j. m. aldaz & j. prez lzaro @xcite .",

    "these results are well in line of what one would expect from a maximal function , however , it is quite interesting that all of them seem quite difficult to prove ; indeed , the sharp constant 1 for the centered maximal function on the real line is still merely conjectural .",
    "+ _ stokes wave .",
    "_ equations of the type appearing in our proof seems to have previously surfaced in a completely different context : in a 1987 paper on on the behaviour of the stokes wave of extreme form near its crest , amick & fraenkel @xcite encounter the equation @xmath61 and require statements about the linear independence of the solutions of such an equation .",
    "all solutions @xmath62 with @xmath63 are simple and the amick - fraenkel conjecture says that @xmath64 shargorodsky @xcite showed that this is implied by the schanuel conjecture .",
    "our proof encounters similar issues but can be unconditionally resolved using the lindemann - weierstrass theorem .",
    "this section contains all the proofs .",
    "we first prove theorem 1 and then show how it implies theorem 2 and theorem 3 .",
    "the proof of theorem 1 uses an expansion into fourier series and the fact that averaging over intervals acts diagonally on the fourier basis .",
    "this implies that a particular fourier series has to vanish identically which implies that all fourier coefficients have to vanish identically  this can be reduced to a system of diophantine equations ( over @xmath65 ) . using arguments from transcendental number theory ,",
    "we can show that this system only has the trivial solution , which implies that the function has to be localized at one point in the frequency spectrum . the latter part of the argument is exploiting the arising structure in a very particular way and seems to only work in the very special case we are considering .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 for some @xmath3 is periodic .",
    "without loss of generality , we can use the symmetries of the statement to assume that the function has mean value 0 and the smallest period is @xmath66 and that it can be written as @xmath67 we assume now that @xmath68 the trigonometric identities @xmath69 yield that @xmath70 here we invoke the classical theorem of bernstein ( see , e.g. @xcite ) stating that periodic functions in @xmath2 for some @xmath3 have an absolutely convergent fourier series .",
    "furthermore , this allows us to interchange the sum and derivative with respect to @xmath31 @xmath71 because @xmath72 and therefore @xmath73 the only way for a fourier series to vanish everywhere is for all the coefficients to vanish .",
    "note that @xmath23 and therefore @xmath74 for any fixed @xmath75 , it is certainly possible to choose @xmath29 in such a way that the equation is satisfied .",
    "it remains to show that no two such equations can be satisfied at the same time .",
    "we prove this by contradiction and assume now that @xmath76 this would imply the existence of a solution @xmath77 @xmath78 with @xmath23 and @xmath79 . if we could derive a contradiction from this assumption",
    ", it would imply that , independently of the value @xmath29 , @xmath80 from which the statement follows since then @xmath81 it is not surprising that number theory enters here : one way of rephrasing the problem is that any two elements in the set @xmath82 the rest of the argument can be summarized as follows : the tangent has the powerful property of sending nonzero algebraic numbers to transcendental numbers .",
    "any nonzero solution @xmath83 of the equation @xmath84 must therefore be transcendental , which means that it is never the root of a polynomial with rational coefficients . using multiple angle formulas for the tangent",
    ", the assumption of any nontrivial solution @xmath29 satisfying two of these equations at the same time allows to construct an explicit polynomial for which @xmath29 is a root  this contradiction will conclude the proof .",

    "thus we can focus on the remaining case of @xmath21 and @xmath129 being two - valued ( by the same reasoning 0 always has to be one of the two values ) : @xmath130 we are now in the case where @xmath18 is continuous , non - constant and has vanishing mean : this allows to partition @xmath131 into three nonempty sets @xmath132 we will now prove that @xmath68 this is easy to see on @xmath133 : if @xmath134 and @xmath135 , then the maximal function would have the value @xmath136 . however , by taking the maximal interval of length @xmath66 , we can at least get an average value of 0 , which exceeds @xmath25 .",
