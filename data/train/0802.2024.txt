    "the infectious agents responsible for disease transmission , known as prions , present some unusual biological properties ( as a high resistance to inactivation by heat or radiation ) . according to the  protein - only hypothesis \"",
    ", prions may consist in a misfolded protein ( called prpsc ) , without any nucleic acid .",
    "this hypothesis suggests that prpsc replicates in a self - propagating process , by converting the normal form of prp ( called prpc ) into prpsc @xcite .",
    "many evidences are in favour of an autocatalytic replication of prpsc , as the generation of infectivity from recombinant proteins @xcite or the use of in vitro prpsc conversion systems , such as the protein misfolding cyclic amplification ( pmca ) technique @xcite .",
    "however , the precise mechanism of conversion remains unclear .",

    ", it is supposed that strain diversity is supported by various conformation states of prpsc , that leads to various biological and biochemical properties @xcite . a critical challenge of prion biology consists in elucidating the mechanism of conversion of prpc into prpsc , and therefore how a diversity of strains may exist in the same host ( expressing the same prp molecule ) .    to investigate the conversion of prpc in prpsc , many relevant mathematical modeling of prion replication",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "major aim of these modelling is to demonstrate that essential features of prion disease can be explained by purely physico - chemical mechanisms , as supposed by the protein - only hypothesis . in addition",
    ", mathematical modeling allows to study the effect of every elementary process in a separate manner @xcite , what is difficult to do experimentally .",
    "the early proposed model is the heterodimer one .",

    "this model does not take into account the aggregation of prpsc , and thereby fails to explain the association between infectivity and aggregated prp .",
    "some other mechanisms have been proposed , which are interested in prp aggregation @xcite . based on fibrilar aggregation ,",
    "the model which seems by now broadly accepted is the one of nucleated polymerization @xcite . in this approach",
    ", prpsc is considered to be a polymeric form of prpc .",
    "polymers can lengthen by addition of prpc monomers , and they can replicate by splitting into smaller fragments .",
    "it is worth noting that deterministic @xcite as well as stochastic @xcite simulations of this model lead to an unimodal size distribution of prp aggregates , which seems to be quite insensitive to small variations of parameters @xcite .",

    "however , recent experimental analysis of relation between infectivity and size distribution of prpsc aggregates ( for prpsc purified from infected brain @xcite or for prpsc produced by pmca @xcite ) contradicts this uniform behaviour of prpsc aggregates .",

    "the goal of this present study is to better understand the unexpected experimental size distribution of prion aggregates in brain , and to investigate the potential implication of this size distribution in the strain phenomenon .",
    "to do so , we generalize masel and coauthors model so as to take into account aggregate size - dependent parameters .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we recall and review the model of masel _ et al . _ and its continuous version @xcite which is going to be used .",
    "we introduce our main improvement , namely a size - dependent lenghtening factor related to nonuniform infectivity rate ; and we discuss the eigenvalue problem which is a key tool to analyze the model . in section [ sec : bimodal ] we investigate heuristically and numerically the formation of a bimodal distribution of polymers . in section",
    "[ sec : stability ] we prove the stability of the zero steady state in the disease free regime ( generalizing partially a result in @xcite ) .",

    "the following set of coupled differential equations has been introduced by masel et al .",
    "@xcite in order to model the polymerization ( aggregation , fragmentation ) process involved in infectious prion self - replication .",
    "it describes the dynamics of the quantity of prpc , @xmath1 , coupled with the evolution of aggregates of prpsc which have size @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 the index @xmath5 denotes the minimal size of prpsc polymers . the quantity @xmath6 is the total amount of prion aggregates .",
    "the constant parameters @xmath7 are respectively the basal synthesis rate of prpc , the degradation rate of prpc , the conversion rate of prpc into prpsc ( autocatalytic process following the mass action law ) , the fragmentation coefficient and the degradation rate of prpsc .",

    "our motivation for this work is to better understand the unexpected bimodal size distribution of prions , observed by silveira et al @xcite .",
    "based on the nucleated polymerization model of prion fibril growth describing the dynamics of prpc monomeres and prpsc aggregates , we take into account aggregate - size dependent parameters , expanding thus a previous study @xcite .",
    "we have shown numerically that bimodal stationary distribution can occur in the case of a non - uniform conversion rate from prpc into prpsc .",
    "it is worth noticing that experimental distribution of prp may not correspond to a steady state of the system since the biological process is dramatically stopped with the animal death .",
    "therefore the considerations about the stationary distribution might be not biologically relevant .",
    "nevertheless we also observe bimodal distribution generically along the temporal dynamics , a new feature in comparison to @xcite . for further modifications concerning model",
    "we suggest to take into account saturation in the fragmentation rate for large fibrils , as noticed in @xcite .",
    "theoretical analysis of the model gives necessary criterion on the parameters for a bimodal distribution to occur in the stationary phase .",
    "numerical analysis of the eigenvalue problem shows in addition that parameters which lead to a bimodal distribution of prpsc are not the most favourable for prpsc accumulation in the exponential phase , see figure [ fig : vp ] .",
    "it suggests that infectious ability concentrated on a restricted range of prpsc aggregate sizes ( 14 to 28 molecules @xcite ) does not consist in a replicative advantage for prion at the molecular level .",
    "therefore , this restriction could be caused by a physico - chemical constraint , carried out by the host metabolism or by the prion aggregate itself .",
    "this could eventually be due to the prpsc aggregate shape , since the most infectious intermediate aggregates have been found to be spherical or ellipsoidal whereas the others form fibrilar structures @xcite .",
    "however , understanding the precise nature of the constraint would help to identify new therapeutic targets .    furthermore , we investigate the implications of varying the fragmentation and transconformation rates notably in the biological perspectives of the prion strain phenomenon .",
    "prion strains have been initially distinguished by incubation periods and lesion profiles in congenic mice @xcite .",
    "nowadays , a large body of literature suggests that differences between prion strains lie in the diversity of structures of prpsc aggregates that can be stably and faithfully propagated @xcite .",
    "however , it remains poorly understood how these changes in the conformation of prpsc aggregates can account for their physiopathological effects @xcite . among the attempted biochemical characterisation of prion strains , a relationship was found between the relative stability values of prpsc aggregates @xcite or level of aggregation @xcite and incubation times , indicating that less stable prions are more infectious , as judged by their shorter incubation times .",
    "this is presumably because unstable prions fragment more easily , giving rise to smaller aggregates of prpsc that are more infectious than larger ones ( represented by an increased transconformation rate in the mathematical model ) .",
    "our model agrees with these observations , since increasing the fragmentation rate @xmath198 leads to a faster prpsc accumulation .",
    "more interestingly , our model enables to explore quickly the influence of every elementary mechanism involved in prion replication . whereas changing parameters leads to similar effects on prpsc accumulation kinetics , the resulting size - distribution variations are indeed different .",
    "the achievement of experimental size - distribution of prpsc aggregates for many prion strains , as obtained by silveira et al @xcite for 263k prion strain , could therefore allow to better understand the mechanisms involved in prion strain phenomenon , by comparing the experimental distribution and the predicted ones .",
    "one limit to our approach is that prion strains are not only characterized by a precise incubation time but also by a specific cellular tropism .",
    "it would be of interest to introduce some mathematical formalism taking into account cell heterogenity in the brain and the resulting local influences .",
    "in addition , transmission of prion diseases between different mammalian species is almost systematically less efficient than within a single species .",
    "this obstruction has been termed species barriers .",
    "early studies argue that barrier resides in prp primary structure difference between donor and recipient species @xcite .",
    "however , this issue has been called into question notably by bse strain capability . indeed",
    ", different strains propagated in the same host may thus have completely different barriers to another species .",
    "consequently , transmission barrier appears to depend on prion strain specificities @xcite .",
    "this is supported by our model .",
    "indeed , we learn that the renormalized bimodal distribution of prpsc aggregates tends to align along the eigenvector associated to the dominant eigenvalue @xmath186 ( solid line in figure [ fig : eigenvalue](left ) ) @xcite . in our analysis , we assumed implicitely that the distribution of polymers is initially proportional to this eigenvector ( which depends upon the the parameters of the model , and thus on the strain - host relationship ) .",
    "otherwise there is some delay for the microscopic distribution to reach the good shape which slows down the process of prion accumulation .",
    "this might account for the strain adaptation mechanism , where primary inoculation is associated with more prolonged incubation period than subsequent passages in the same type of hosts @xcite .",
    "according to these observations and the experimental ones , it should be very interesting to study experimentally the distribution of aggregates and infectivity between strains which are able or not to cross many species barriers .",
    "the distributions of prpsc aggregates could be used to evaluate the influence of fragmentation , transconformation rate or infectivity distribution on the strenght of prion strain in crossing species barriers .",
    "these data could give a new signature of prion strain .",
    "meanwhile the elucidation of structural basis of prion strains , strenght barrier species discrimination by these prion strain signature could be useful to predict the potential transmissibility of prion strain to human , notably for recent atypical scrapie strain , bovine amyloidic spongiform encephalopathy ( base ) strain and chronic wasting disease strain @xcite .",
    "thus , our model could be used to investigate essential features of prion strains .",
    "the next step of our work is to approximate faithfully the inverse problem in order to obtain the size dependence of the transconformation rate from the distribution of prpsc .",
    "we therefore would be able to determine the most infectious compartment for several prion strains .",
    "this knowledge is a critical step for experimental approaches of prion infectivity investigation , like pmca .",
    "pmca goal is to quickly synthetize in vitro large amounts of prpsc starting with minute amounts of prions .",
    "the yield of this technique is very sensitive to experimental procedures .",
    "then size distribution of infectivity could help to optimize strain specific pmca protocols , notably by adaptating sonication steps to fall into the most infectious size compartment of prpsc aggregates .",
    "finally , we have analyse the stability of the steady states in a general framework .",
    "the difficulty arising here is that we can not reduce the study to a set of ordinary differential equations , as it is the case in @xcite . under general assumptions on the coefficients ,",
    "compatible with bimodal distributions , the asymptotic stability of the healthy state ( i.e. no prion aggregates ) is established when the prpc is low .",
    "we also prove that this healthy state is unstable when the prpc production rate is high enough .",
    "this is in accordance with the asymptotic stability of the non - zero steady state for constant coefficients proved in @xcite , even though a perfect dichotomy between the two results is left open in the general case .",
    "biologically , these results can be interpreted as the propensity of prpsc aggregates to give rise to prion disease depends on the amount of prpc . in the more general context of understanding why some amyloids are infectious and others are",
    "not , it therefore could be useful to investigate the amount of amyloidogenic precursors .",
