    "despite the strong theoretical prejudices favouring a flat universe@xcite , there is a fair amount of observational data which suggests the possibility of an open universe , with a present density that could be as low as @xmath0notably , the so - called ` age problem'@xcite and recent measurements of the baryonic content of x - ray clusters@xcite . since in a low-@xmath1 universe structures collapse earlier",
    ", observations of galaxies at high redshift would also be easier to explain if the universe is open .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to consider how some of the standard cosmological scenarios would change if this possibility turns out to be true .",
    "one relevant case is that of the evolution of a network of cosmic strings@xcite .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that defect models normalized to cobe in an open universe predict a galaxy power spectrum consistent with that inferred from galaxy surveys without requiring an extreme bias ( in general , @xmath2 models predict more small - scale power than low-@xmath3 ones ) . however , these results were established either using _ a priori _ scaling assumptions for the string network@xcite or numerical simulations of texture evolution@xcite . here",
    "we study the evolution of a cosmic string network in open universes , using the velocity - dependent ` one - scale ' model of martins & shellard@xcite , which provides the first quantitative description of the complete evolution of the large - scale properties of a cosmic string network .",
    "this is briefly summarised below , and used in the following section to obtain the evolutionary properties of both the long - string and the loop populations in an open universe ; these are then compared with the standard flat universe case , and some implications of these results are discussed .",
    "two different but complementary approaches have been used to study cosmic string evolution . the simplest ( although more expensive ) is to use large numerical simulations@xcite . among other interesting things ,",
    "these revealed a significant amount of small - scale structure ( or ` wiggles ' ) on the strings , containing up to one half of the total string energy .    on the other hand",
    ", there is always thew possibility of using analytic methods ",
    "an approach first used by kibble@xcite . due to the strings statistical nature , what one really does is ` string thermodynamics ' , that is describing the network by a small number of macroscopic ( or ` averaged ' ) quantities whose evolution equations are derived from the microscopic string equations of motion , and introducing additional ` phenomenological parameters ' if necessary .",
    "the first such model providing a quantitative picture of the complete evolution of a string network ( and the corresponding loop population ) has been recently developed by martins & shellard@xcite ; this has the added advantage of being equally applicable to the study of vortex - string evolution in a condensed matter context@xcite . here",
    "we will present a very brief description of this model  the reader is referred to the original paper@xcite for further details .",
    "apart from the straightforward definition of the energy of a piece of string , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the coordinate energy per unit @xmath6 ) , the only other macroscopic quantity in this model is the string rms velocity , defined by @xmath7    explicitly distinguishing between long ( or ` infinite ' ) strings and loops , we can use the fact that the former should be brownian to define the long - string correlation length as @xmath8 .",
    "phenomenological terms must be included for the interchange of energy between long strings and loops .",
    "a ` loop chopping efficiency ' parameter ( expected to be slightly smaller than unity ) is introduced to characterise loop production @xmath9 and in the particular case of gut - scale strings ( but not more generally@xcite ) it can be safely assumed that loop reconnections onto the long - string network are negligible . in particular , this has been confirmed in numerical simulations@xcite . note that it is conceivable that the behaviour of @xmath10 is different in flat and open universes . however",
    ", this effect will not be crucial , because the scaling properties do not depend strongly on it@xcite .",
    "it is then simple to derive the evolution equation for the correlation length @xmath11 .",
    "since we are only interested in the epoch around radiation - matter equality , we need not be considering frictional forces@xcite , and we simply have @xmath12    for the case of string loops , the relevant lengthscale is simply the loop length , which decays due to gravitational radiation , and its evolution equation is @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "then the only other thing that is needed is an assumption on the loop size at formation . in the epoch relevant to this paper",
    ", we expect it to be approximately constant and much smaller than the correlation length  we will take @xmath15 .",
    "then for any given time , one only has to look at the loops that have formed until then , determine which of them are still around and add up their lengths to determine the total energy density in the form of loops .",
    "this is conveniently expressible in terms of the ratio of the energy densities in loops and long strings @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a lorentz factor accounting for the fact that loops are usually produced with a non - zero centre - of - mass velocity , @xmath18 is the loop size at formation relative to the correlation length at that time and @xmath19 is the length at time @xmath20 of a loop that was formed at a time @xmath21 .",
    "finally , one can derive an evolution equation for the long string or loop velocity with only a little more than newton s second law @xmath22 here @xmath23 is another phenomenological parameter that is related to the presence of small - scale structure on the strings ; an appropriate ansatz for it is ( refer to @xcite for a complete justification ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the curvature radius of the string ( that is , @xmath26 for long strings , but @xmath27 for loops ) and @xmath28 is a numerically determined coefficient of order unity , whose precise value depends on whether one is using the above ansatz for long strings or loops ",
    "see@xcite for a complete discussion of this point .",
    "the above quantities are sufficient to quantitatively describe the large - scale characteristics of a cosmic string network around the epoch of equal matter and radiation densities ( see@xcite ) . in a more general situation",
    "one would need to include the effect of frictional forces@xcite due to particle scattering on the strings .",
    "we now come to the issue of this paper . as we already pointed out",
    ", we only need to study the behaviour of the string network in the transition between the radiation- and the matter - dominated regimes ( see martins & shellard@xcite for a detailed discussion of the early stages of evolution of gut - scale and other cosmic string networks ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see that there is one crucial difference with respect to the case of a flat universe : in an open universe there will no longer be a linear scaling regime .",
    "this arises naturally from the fact that in a universe where the scale factor grows as @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 ) the linear regime has the following properties @xmath31^{1/2 }   \\ , , \\label{openl}\\ ] ] @xmath32^{1/2 }   \\ , .",
    "\\label{openv}\\ ] ] in an open universe the ` effective ' @xmath33 is a variable , increasing from @xmath34 in the radiation era to an asymptotic value of @xmath35 ( see figure [ figopenu ] ) .",
    "for example , if we happen to live in a universe where @xmath36 , we have @xmath37 today , and @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "in other words , there will be corrections to the simple linear behaviour , such that the correlation length @xmath11 will grow slightly faster than @xmath20 .",
    "nevertheless , since the horizon size for an @xmath29 universe is @xmath40 one can easily show that @xmath11 will always be smaller than the horizon .",
    "on the other hand , the string velocity will decrease with time , and therefore loop formation will gradually switch off .    note that the power - law dependence of the scale factor obviously changes in the transition between radiation and matter domination , even in the case of a flat universe . in particular , there will of course be a departure from linear scaling while the transition is taking place , with @xmath41 growing from @xmath42 to @xmath43 ( approximately ) .    in particular , we can easily find the solution to the averaged equations of motion in the limit where @xmath35 , @xmath44 note that in this limit the correlation length grows more slowly than the horizon ( which goes like @xmath45 ) .    in order to get quantitative results , we must solve the averaged evolution equations described in section [ s - mod ] numerically .",
    "to these we must add a further equation  the friedmann equation  specifying how the scale factor ( and hence the hubble parameter ) evolves in the transition between the radiation- and the matter - dominated epochs : @xmath46 where @xmath47 for a flat universe and @xmath48 for an open universe ; note that we should at least consider the possibility of the string density becoming a non - negligible source for the friedmann equation .",
    "figures [ openlong ] and [ openloop ] contrast the evolution of the long - string and loop populations in a flat universe and in open universes with @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( we have assumed that @xmath51 in both cases ) ; note that the present epoch corresponds to @xmath52 .    as was first discussed in@xcite , even in the case of a flat universe the transition from the radiation to the matter epoch is a very slow process , lasting about eight orders of magnitude in time . in the case of an open universe , apart from the differences we already expected , the most interesting result is that , although the string density always decreases with respect to the critical density ( as one would also expect ) , at a redshift around @xmath53 ( which is approximately when curvature has started to dominate the dynamics ) the string density has started to grow relative to the background density .",
    "in fact , in a @xmath49 universe strings will become the main component of the universe in about seven orders of magnitude in time , whereas if we had @xmath50 this would only take about four orders of magnitude in time .",
    "it is also interesting to point out that , although having @xmath49 or @xmath50 does not yield very significant differences in the values of the long - string correlation length or velocity , it does produce very significant differences in the ratio of the long - string and loop densities to that of the background .",
    "moreover , one should note that despite the significant drop in the number of loops produced ( see [ openloop](a ) ) , the ratio of the energy densities in loops and long strings decreases rather more slowly .",
    "this is because loops are slightly larger at formation and , since the average long - string velocity is decreasing , so is that of large enough loops ( note that we assume that the rms loop velocity at formation is equal to the rms long string velocity at that time ) .",
    "consequently , loops will live longer , since the redshift and gravitational radiation terms in ( [ evlps ] ) are velocity - dependent .",
    "in this paper we presented the first discussion of cosmic string evolution in open universes , in the context of the generalized ` one - scale ' model of martins & shellard@xcite .",
    "we have shown that there is no linear scaling regime in an open universe , and that although the string density always decreases with respect to the critical density , it has been increasing relative to that of the background from @xmath53 , and it will become the main component of the universe sometime in the future .    these differences with respect to the standard ( flat universe ) case only become significant fairly late in the matter - dominated epoch ,",
    "so with respect to the string - seeded structure formation scenario we should only expect changes on very large scales  that one can easily estimate to be larger than the scales of the largest existing surveys .",
    "on the other hand , such large scales are of course relevant when one is comparing the cosmic microwave background anisotropies produced by cosmic strings to cobe data  thereby normalizing the string mass per unit length@xcite  since this essentially involves an integration from the present time to the surface of last scattering .",
    "thus the changes in the string network properties discussed in the present paper can significantly alter this normalization .",
    "this issue will be discussed in a forthcoming publication .",
