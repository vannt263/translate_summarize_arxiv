    "the interpretation and theoretical description of measurements on quantum systems have been under debate since the birth of quantum theory  @xcite .",
    "more recently , interest for this question has been revived by new developments in quantum information .",
    "quantum detection can be used either to extract information on quantum states or to monitor quantum systems ( quantum trajectories  @xcite , quantum zeno effect  @xcite ) .",
    "quantitative treatments of measurement models serve both to elucidate the self - consistency of quantum theory and its interpretation , and to calculate the time scales relevant for experiments .",
    "data for the decoherence time are in fact accumulating , in microwave cavities  @xcite , in solid state devices like superconducting tunnel junction nanocircuits  @xcite , and in electron beams interacting with a semiconducting plate  @xcite . on a more fundamental ground , ever larger classes of nonlocal",
    "hidden - variable theories are being ruled out experimentally as competitors of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "we propose in this letter to extend the range of validity of the approach by zeh , zurek , and others based on environment - induced decoherence @xcite . in this vein ,",
    "i.e. , on the basis of the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics ( born rules ) and of a lack of knowledge about the microscopic degrees of freedom of the apparatus , we demonstrate that the reading of a macroscopic pointer of the apparatus reveals an eigenvalue of an observable of the measured quantum object , in spite of the unitary evolution of the composite system ( object and apparatus ) .",
    "we obtain explicit results for the object - pointer dynamics for a class of models under realistic assumptions .",
    "we would like to note that macroscopic manifestations of microscopic quantum fluctuations are not the exclusive privilege of measurement : they also appear e.g. in superfluorescence , where intense light pulses display substantial shot - to - shot fluctuations  @xcite and in cosmic rays , where single particles propagating in a fluctuating spacetime generate large showers of particles in the atmosphere .    during an ideal measurement the quantum object ( @xmath0 ) interacts with the pointer ( @xmath1 ) in such a way that a one - to - one correspondence arises between the eigenvalues of the measured object observable and macroscopically distinct pointer states .",
    "the coupling of @xmath1 with its environment ( `` bath '' @xmath2 ) causes decoherence .",
    "most previous work deals with these two interactions separately ( see , however , @xcite ) : a first step ( `` premeasurement '' ) exclusively treats the unitary evolution entangling @xmath0 and @xmath1 and yields a superposition of the macroscopically distinct object - pointer states associated with each eigenvalue of the measured observable .",
    "that latter `` schrdinger cat '' state is taken as the initial state for a second process , decoherence ; there , the quantum correlations between object and apparatus are transformed into classical correlations , as the superposition of object - pointer states is degraded to a statistical mixture of the same states .",
    "for such a sequential treatment to make physical sense , the time duration of the entanglement process would have to be short compared with the decoherence time @xmath3 .",
    "but since the latter tends to be very small for macroscopic superpositions , that assumption is quite questionable .",
    "a second shortcoming of some previous work lies in the assumption of initial statistical independence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; since these two systems can not be isolated from each other , a more realistic assumption is a metastable local thermal state of @xmath4 . as a third restriction ,",
    "memory effects are often neglected for the ( reduced ) object - pointer dynamics . that markov approximation assumes @xmath5 to be larger than the bath correlation time @xmath6 , a condition not satisfied in some experiments  @xcite and of questionable validity if macroscopic or even mesoscopic superpositions or mixtures arise during the object - pointer evolution .",
    "we overcome the three aforementioned deficiencies .",
    "the key is an assumption for a certain ordering of time scales : the decoherence time @xmath7 and the object - pointer interaction time @xmath8 must be small compared to the characteristic time @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) of the evolution of the measured observable @xmath11 ( the pointer position @xmath12 ) under the object hamiltonian @xmath13 ( the pointer hamiltonian @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 in the last limit , @xmath16 denotes the inverse temperature of the bath .",
    "as desirable for a measurement , the free dynamics of @xmath0 then remains ineffective on @xmath11 during the measurement , i.e. , @xmath17 for @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 means that the expectation value of @xmath20 in the object initial state is approximately equal to the @xmath21th moment of @xmath11 , for any @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , the free dynamics of @xmath1 is ineffective to move the pointer between @xmath23 and @xmath24 . note that @xmath25 if @xmath11 commutes with @xmath13 .",
    "the conditions on @xmath9 in ( [ timescales ] ) are necessary in order that an eigenstate @xmath26 of @xmath11 be left almost unchanged by the measurement .",
    "the conditions on @xmath10 ( in particular , the high - temperature limit @xmath27 ) would be difficult to avoid for a macroscopic pointer .",
    "a further key input is the quantum central limit theorem ( qclt )  @xcite which implies gaussian statistics ( wick theorem ) for the bath coupling agent in the pointer - bath interaction , as discussed below .",
    "the limits ( [ timescales ] ) and the qclt imply validity of our results for a wide class of objects and apparatus .",
    "an extreme case of universality  @xcite arises under the further stipulation that entanglement and decoherence be faster than the decay of bath correlations ( time constant @xmath6 ) .",
    "indeed , for @xmath28 even the free bath motion remains ineffective during the measurement .",
    "opposite to that slow - bath limit is the markov regime @xmath29 .",
    "our analysis below covers both these regimes as well as the intermediate case @xmath30 .",
    "we consider a three - partite system comprising the microscopic object @xmath0 , a single - degree - of - freedom macroscopic pointer @xmath1 and a bath @xmath2 with many ( @xmath31 ) degrees of freedom ( labelled by @xmath32 ) .",
    "the following dynamical variables will come into play : for @xmath0 , the observable @xmath33 to be measured , assumed to have a discrete spectrum ; for @xmath1 , the position @xmath34 and momentum @xmath35 ; and for @xmath2 , a certain coupling agent @xmath36 .",
    "the pointer is coupled to @xmath0 and @xmath2 by the hamiltonians @xmath37 the object - pointer coupling hamiltonian @xmath38 is chosen so as to ( i )  not change the measured observable @xmath11 ( i.e. , @xmath39=0 $ ] ) ; ( ii )  be capable of shifting the pointer position by an amount proportional to @xmath33 , such that each eigenvalue @xmath40 of @xmath11 becomes tied up with a specific pointer reading ; ( iii )  involve a large coupling constant @xmath41 , so that different eigenvalues @xmath42 end up associated with pointer readings separated by large distances .",
    "the pointer - bath interaction is chosen for most efficient decoherence of distinct pointer positions  @xcite ; the additivity of @xmath36 in contributions @xmath43 acting on single degrees of freedom of the bath will allow us to invoke the qclt .",
    "let us point out an essential difference between our model and the interacting spin model of  @xcite .",
    "unlike in this reference , @xmath0 is strongly coupled to a single degree of freedom ( the pointer @xmath1 ) of the apparatus , e.g. with its total momentum @xmath44 in a given direction .",
    "the coupling of @xmath0 with the other apparatus degrees of freedom ( the bath @xmath2 , for us ) is assumed to be much weaker and can therefore be neglected ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the full hamiltonian is @xmath45 .",
    "we need not specify @xmath13 .",
    "the pointer hamiltonian @xmath46 must allow for a well - defined rest state .",
    "we assume that @xmath47 has a local minimum at @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the time scale for free pointer motion then is the period @xmath51 of oscillations around this minimum . like the coupling agent @xmath36 , the bath hamiltonian @xmath52",
    "is assumed additive as @xmath53 with @xmath54\\propto \\delta_{\\mu \\nu }   \\dot{b}_\\mu$ ] and @xmath55=0 $ ] , again clearing ground for the qclt .",
    "it is appropriate to require initial statistical independence of the object and the apparatus , and thermal equilibrium for the apparatus .",
    "the initial density operator @xmath56 of the object may represent a pure or a mixed state .",
    "the full initial density operator reads @xmath57 by invoking the high - temperature limit @xmath27 and the gaussian statistics of @xmath36 ( as implied by the qclt ) and by tracing out the bath we find ( see below ) the reduced density matrix @xmath58 of the pointer in the position representation , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the thermal de broglie wavelength .",
    "the pointer potential here appears renormalized by the pointer - bath interaction as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the autocorrelator of the bath coupling agent with respect to the free bath thermal state @xmath63 , @xmath64 and we assume @xmath65 . for stability of the whole apparatus the pointer - bath coupling must be weak enough so that @xmath66 ; we even bound the latter curvature finitely away from zero by , say , @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 this makes sure that the initial density @xmath69 of pointer positions has a single peak at @xmath48 with a renormalized width @xmath70^{-1/2}$ ] of the order of the bare thermal fluctuation @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath72 at large distances @xmath73 , the effective potential @xmath74 is unstable . the matrix elements ( [ eq - rhop(0 ) ] ) then correspond to ( the reduced pointer state of ) a _ local thermal equilibrium_. that local equilibrium for the apparatus can be achieved by preparing @xmath1 in some state localized near @xmath48 at time @xmath75 and then letting it interact with @xmath2 between @xmath75 and @xmath23 .",
    "if the thermalization time is small compared with the tunnelling escape time , one may choose @xmath76 larger than the former but much smaller than the latter time , so that @xmath1 is still within the effective potential well when the measurement starts at @xmath23 . in order to be able to prepare the apparatus in such a local equilibrium , the",
    "height @xmath77 of the two potential barriers surrounding the local minimum of @xmath74 at @xmath48 must be large compared with the thermal energy @xmath78 .",
    "thanks to ( [ eq - stability ] ) , this is the case provided that the bare potential @xmath47 satisfies the same requirement , i.e. , @xmath79 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath47 can be chosen such that the two potential barriers of @xmath74 are separated by a mesoscopic distance @xmath80 ( so that @xmath81 ) which is small compared with the macroscopic read - out scale @xmath82 .",
    "the object - pointer interaction then just has to get the pointer out of the well , leaving the subsequent displacement growth to the action of the effective pointer potential .",
    "the instability resulting from the pointer - bath coupling ( [ eq - int_hamiltonian ] ) hence provides an amplification mechanism . for a macroscopic pointer at high temperature ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "the different length scales are ordered as @xmath83 .",
    "assuming that the bath state is not ascertainable , we define the object - pointer density matrix at time @xmath84 as @xmath85 . accepting a relative error @xmath86 ,",
    "we simplify the time evolution operator at time @xmath87 as @xmath88 , with @xmath89 here , @xmath90 denotes time ordering ; the momentum @xmath44 was used as the generator of pointer displacements , @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , we invoke @xmath92 , the cyclicity of the trace and the product initial state ( [ eq - initial_state ] ) to get the matrix elements of @xmath93 in the joint eigenbasis @xmath94 of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath95 with @xmath96 evolving as for the free object , while the pointer matrix elements @xmath97 involve the bath evolution operator and shifted positions @xmath98 note that @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath13 can not be neglected in ( [ eq - rhos^0 ] ) , even for @xmath101 , although for such times @xmath102 .    to evaluate the matrix elements ( [ eq - pointer_matrix_elements ] ) we use the high - temperature approximation @xmath103 for the pointer - bath gibbs state ( [ eqapp ] ) .",
    "given the weak - coupling condition @xmath104 implying the stability ( [ eq - stability ] ) ( thanks to @xmath105 , see  @xcite ) , the error incurred is @xmath106 , as easily seen from the baker - campbell - haussdorf formula .",
    "thus @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the bath average with respect to the modified equilibrium state @xmath109 ; the normalization factor is determined by using the qclt as  @xcite @xmath110    at this point we momentarily pause with dynamics and show that at @xmath23 , when @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , ( [ eq - y - integral ] ) yields the initial pointer state announced in ( [ eq - rhop(0 ) ] ) . to that end we invoke high temperatures @xmath114 again to approximate the matrix element @xmath115 by @xmath116 .",
    "replacing @xmath117 by @xmath118 in that expression and doing the gaussian @xmath119-integral in ( [ eq - y - integral ] ) , we arrive at the initial state ( [ eq - rhop(0 ) ] ) by neglecting terms @xmath120 .",
    "let us return to the time - evolved pointer matrix ( [ eq - y - integral ] ) . since @xmath121 factors into single - degree - of - freedom states , the qclt assigns gaussian statistics to the bath coupling agent @xmath36 for the average @xmath122 , with a mean @xmath123 given by linear response theory and a variance _ independent of y _",
    "@xcite , @xmath124 therefore , @xmath125 coincides with its value for @xmath126 up to a phase factor @xmath127 and the @xmath119-integral in ( [ eq - y - integral ] ) remains gaussian for @xmath128 .    of prime importance is the _ decoherence factor _",
    "@xmath129 with a _ positive decoherence exponent _ @xmath130 revealed by the qclt as  @xcite @xmath131 and a real phase @xmath132 irrelevant for decoherence .",
    "let us stress that the aforementioned results ( in particular ( [ eq - d_t ] ) ) are exact ( not lowest order in the pointer - bath coupling ) .",
    "they are consequences of wick s theorem as implied by the qclt and the additivity ( [ eq - int_hamiltonian ] ) of the bath coupling agent @xmath36",
    ". direct proofs of ( [ eq - z_by ] ) , ( [ eq - varianceb ] ) and ( [ eq - d_t ] ) are easy in the particular case of a bath composed of harmonic oscillators linearly coupled to @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out  @xcite that the phase factor @xmath133entails nothing but a correction of relative order @xmath134 to the decoherence exponent @xmath130 under the stability condition ( [ eq - stability ] ) . dropping that correction",
    ", the @xmath119-integral reduces to the initial pointer density matrix ( [ eq - rhop(0 ) ] ) , albeit with the shifted pointer positions @xmath135 and @xmath136 reflecting the action of the object - pointer coupling .",
    "our final result for the object - pointer state at time @xmath87  is @xmath137 with the notations specified in ( [ eq - rhop(0 ) ] ) , ( [ eq - rhos^0 ] ) and ( [ eq - d_t ] ) . entanglement and decoherence contribute separately in that remarkably simple `` final state '' ; they lead respectively to the second and third factors in ( [ eq - object - pointer - state ] ) .",
    "the decoherence ( third ) factor equals unity for @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "given the narrow peaks ( of width @xmath140 ) of the initial pointer density matrix ( [ eq - rhop(0 ) ] ) at @xmath141 , one can appreciate the fate of the @xmath142 coherences in the final state ( [ eq - object - pointer - state ] ) by setting @xmath143 there .",
    "the decoherence factor then reads @xmath144 and reveals irreversible decay as soon as the time @xmath84 much exceeds the _ decoherence time _",
