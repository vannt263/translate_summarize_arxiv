    "frequently problems arise in science which involve both additive and multiplicative noise .",
    "the first type is relatively easy to handle with the help of the central limit theorem .",
    "the situation changes dramatically with the appearance of multiplicative noise .",
    "famous examples are the anderson localization , turbulence , and the kicked quantum rotator among others . in this",
    "field results of an importance comparable to the central limit theorem are still lacking .",
    "moreover , the approaches are in general numerical ones and analytical tools are the rare exception .",
    "we present such an analytic approach which permits to deal in great generality with processes involving multiplicative and additive noise even in the limit of strong disorder . in this paper",
    "we apply the formalism to the famous anderson localization in a two - dimensional ( 2-d ) disordered system which is one of the paradigms of solid state theory .",
    "the quantum mechanical consequences of disorder in solids have first been revealed by anderson @xcite .",
    "the anderson model provides a standard framework for discussing the electronic properties of disordered systems , see reviews @xcite .",
    "the nature of electronic states in the anderson model depends strongly on the spatial dimension @xmath0 .",
    "it has been shown rigorously that in one dimension ( 1-d ) all states are localized at any level of disorder @xcite .",
    "the shape of these localized wave functions is characterized by an asymptotic exponential decay described by the lyapunov exponent @xmath1 .",
    "the most important results for dimensions higher than one follow from the famous scaling theory of localization @xcite , which assumes a single scaling parameter for the dimensionless conductance @xmath2 or , equivalently , the localization length @xmath3 .",
    "the conclusion of the scaling theory is that for @xmath4 all states are localized at any level of disorder , while a delocalization ( metal - insulator ) transition occurs for @xmath5 if the disorder is sufficiently strong .",
    "a detailed review of the scaling theory for disordered systems can be found in @xcite .",
    "the 2-d case still presents a problem , since there is no exact analytical solution to the anderson problem , and all numerical results published so far rely on finite - size scaling @xcite .",
    "recent studies @xcite have questioned the validity of the single parameter scaling theory , including the existence of a finite asymptotic localization length for @xmath6 .",
    "additional boost of interest in the @xmath7 anderson model has been triggered by experimental observations of kravchenko et al .",
    "@xcite of a metal - insulator transition in thin semiconductor films , which contradicts the conventional scaling theory .",
    "moreover , recent experiments of ilani et al .",
    "@xcite can be interpreted in terms of the coexistence of localized and delocalized states .",
    "these experiments are still being discussed controversially .",
    "the experimental reality is certainly more complex than the simple tight - binding schemes used in the theoretical treatment so far and in particular the electronic iteractions could play a role in the above mentioned experimental situations .",
    "but nevertheless these results add doubts to the status of the localization theory in 2-d . before embarking on computational schemes beyond the tight - binding approach , which necessarily lead to more restricted system sizes and other approximations",
    ", it appears advisable to try to solve as rigourously as possible the problem in the tight - binding scheme . in the present controversial situation",
    "the first step in resolving the conflict is thus in our opinion to consider exact results that do not rely on the scaling theory or small parameter expansions .",
    "the starting point for the method presented in this paper is found in the work of molinari @xcite , in which the anderson problem for the 1-d system is dealt with as a statistical stability problem for the solutions @xmath8 of the tight binding hamiltonian in a semi - infinite system , @xmath9 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the equations for the statistical moments of the type @xmath10 can be obtained analytically ( explicit solutions are given for @xmath11 ) , which enabled the author to derive exact generalized lyapunov exponents .",
    "we will show in the following that this approach can be further generalized for systems of higher spatial dimensions .",
    "but it turns out to be unavoidable to change again the mathematical tools for the treatment . in the present investigation",
    "we use both for the 1-d and the 2-d case the tool of signal theory abundantly used in electrical engineering , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "the basic idea in applying signal theory to the problem of anderson localization is to interpret certain moments of the wave function as signals .",
    "there is then in signal theory a qualitative difference between localized and extended states : the first ones correspond to unbounded signals and the latter ones to bounded signals . in the case of a metal - insulator transition extended states ( bounded signals )",
    "transform into localized states ( unbounded signals ) .",
    "signal theory shows that it is possible in this case to find a function ( the system function or filter ) , which is responsible for this transformation .",
    "the advantage of working with filters instead of the signals themselves lies in the fact that the filters do not depend on initial conditions in contrast to the signals .",
    "the existence of this transformation in a certain region of disorder and energy simply means that the filter looses its stability in this region .",
    "the meaning of an unstable filter is defined by a specific pole diagram in the complex plane .",
    "these poles also define a quantitative measure of localization .",
    "thus it is possible here to determine the socalled generalized lyapunov exponents as a function of disorder and energy .    the outline of the present article is as follows . in chapter 2",
    "we treat the 1-d case in detail describing also essential elements of signal theory .",
    "the theory for the 2-d problem is presented in chapter 3 and the results are given in chapter 4 . in the latter chapter also",
    "the implications of the present approach for perturbation theory , the order of the phase transition and the problem of self - averaging is discussed as well as numerical scaling .",
    "we start for pedagogical and methodical reasons with the treatment of the 1-d case .",
    "the aim of this section is to apply mathematical tools which are new in the field of anderson localization but well - known from other fields and which may and do in fact prove useful also for the higher dimensional cases .",
    "we start from the hamiltonian of the standard 1-d anderson model in the tight - binding representation @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the hopping matrix element ( units with t=1 are used below ) and the @xmath14 are the on - site potentials which are random variables to simulate the disorder .",
    "the @xmath15 are independently and identically distributed with existing first two moments , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this model is well investigated @xcite and it is known that for any degree of disorder the eigenfunctions become localized .",
    "this in turn means that @xmath18 with @xmath19 is growing exponentially in the mean on a semi - infinite chain where the rate of growth is described by the lyapunov exponent .    in the one - dimensional case",
    "one can compute the lyapunov exponent by different methods and under different assumptions @xcite or numerically by means of the transfer matrix method which results in solving a recurrence equation @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of these analytical methods is that they can not be easily extended to the 2-d and 3-d cases . in this paper",
    "we want to show that one can construct an approach which is able to handle all cases from a universal point of view .",
    "it is well - known that the two - point boundary problem for a finite difference analog to the stationary schrdinger equation with homogeneous boundary conditions can be reduced to a cauchy problem with the one - side ( initial ) condition @xcite @xmath20 due to the linearity of the equation the non - zero value of @xmath21 serves only as a normalization parameter .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the solution is completely determined by the energy @xmath22 and the level of disorder @xmath23 .",
    "the presence of a boundary permits one to rewrite the schrdinger equation @xmath24 in the form of a recursion relation for the grid amplitude of the wave function @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) : @xmath27 statistical correlations in this equation are separated : it is easy to see that in a formal solution of the recursion relation the amplitude @xmath28 depends only on the random variables @xmath29 with @xmath30 , which is the causality principle",
    ". this observation has been extensively used by molinari@xcite in the solution for the 1-d case .",
    "we emphasize that this property is fundamental as a key for obtaining an exact solution to the anderson problem for all dimensions .",
    "note that both amplitudes @xmath8 and @xmath31 on the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ recursion ] ) are statistically independent of @xmath32 .    the equation for the first moment of the random variable @xmath8 does not include the parameter @xmath33 : @xmath34 the ansatz @xmath35 results in the @xmath36 which satisfy the equation @xmath37 .",
    "energies with @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 , obviously coincide with the band of delocalized states in a perfect chain ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "a bounded asymptotical behaviour of the first moment at any level of disorder indicates that there are always physical solutions inside the band @xmath38 .",
    "further information about the character of these states ( localized / delocalized ) can be gained by considering the other moments . for one - dimensional models with random potential",
    "the eigenstates are always exponentially localized @xcite .",
    "the natural quantities to investigate is therefore the lyapunov exponent @xmath42 @xmath43 the generalized exponents have been studied extensively by pendry et al .",
    "( see ref . @xcite and references given there ) , in a systematic approach based on the symmetric group .",
    "the method involves the construction of a generalized transfer matrix by means of direct products of the transfer matrices , followed by a reduction of the matrix size .",
    "this generalized transfer matrix produces the average values of the required power of the quantity under consideration .",
    "the concept of lyapunov exponent @xmath1 and the corresponding localization length @xmath44 describe a statistical stability of solutions of the tight - binding equations .",
    "anderson localization as a metal - insulator transition is a typical critical phenomenon . to determine the phase - diagram of the system we need only make use of the qualitative aspect of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "two phases differ qualitatively : @xmath45 for conducting states ( metallic phase ) and @xmath46 for localized states ( insulating phase ) .",
    "the lyapunov exponent @xmath1 is a typical order parameter @xcite .",
    "it is useful to check whether this kind of relation is valid for other systems like ferromagnets and ferroelectrics too . here",
    "the order parameters are the magnetization @xmath47 and the polarization @xmath48 , respectively . at high temperatures and zero external field",
    "these values are @xmath49 ( paramagnetic or paraelectric phase ) . at lower temperatures , however ,",
    "spontaneous magnetization and polarization arise , @xmath50 .",
    "the order parameter is zero for one phase and becomes nonzero for the other phase .",
    "it is well - known that there is no unambiguous definition of an order parameter @xcite .",
    "this holds also in our case , many different definitions are possible ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and literature cited there ) .",
    "every exact lyapunov exponent either via the log - definition ( @xmath42 ) or via the @xmath51-definition ( @xmath52 ) gives this property .",
    "this permits us to consider a transition from the quality @xmath45 to the quality @xmath46 as a critical point , where all moments @xmath53 diverge for @xmath54 simultaneously .",
    "if on the other hand we are interested in the values themselves of the lyapunov exponents @xmath55 , they always depend on the definition .",
    "if one prefers a particular definition , this can only be by agreement and always remains quite arbitrary .    in the 1-d case",
    "we find the metallic phase ( @xmath56 ) only for @xmath41 ; even for infinitesimally small disorder one has @xmath57 and only the insulating phase exists .",
    "the critical point is therefore @xmath58 independently of the value of the energy @xmath22 , and the phase - diagram is trivial .",
    "this situation is typical for a critical phenomenon in a 1-d system with short range interaction @xcite : all 1-d systems ( e.g. 1-d ising - model ) do not possess a true phase transition at a finite value of the parameter ( temperature in the ising model or disorder @xmath23 in the anderson model ) ; one of the phases exists only at a point .",
    "one also says @xcite , that 1-d systems do not possess a phase transition .",
    "the advantage of the new @xmath51-definition rests in the possibility to play with the parameter @xmath51 which gives a new degree of freedom . in quantum theory",
    "there are many examples , where a problem is insoluble in the schrdinger picture , but looks rather simple in the heisenberg picture .",
    "the same holds for representations in coordinate or momentum space .",
    "it is always useful to transform the mathematics in such a way that the problem becomes soluble . and nothing else is done here . for @xmath42 ( log - definition )",
    "the problem remains analytically insoluble .",
    "molinari @xcite was the first to show that with a generalisation of the definition , and for special values of @xmath59 , a simple analytical ( algebraic ) investigation becomes possible .",
    "molinari@xcite has not only considered a standard definition via `` the log of the wave function '' i.e. @xmath42 , but also a set of so - called generalized lyapunov exponents @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 for the square of the wave function ) . in general",
    "all the @xmath60 are quite different parameters .",
    "however , it is important that a transition from the quality @xmath45 to the quality @xmath46 is simultaneous , all @xmath63 for @xmath41 and @xmath64 for a disordered system .",
    "as has already been established @xcite , in the limit of small disorder different definitions of the lyapunov exponent or localization length give values differing only by an integer factor .",
    "this property is again a signature for a critical phenomenon . in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath58 as common for all critical phenomena and only one scale dominates .",
    "thus molinari has shown that for the 1-d anderson problem all @xmath65 for @xmath66 ( this is proven for @xmath67 ) , where @xmath68 is taken from other investigations@xcite , the only difference being the numerical cofactor .",
    "this means that even in 1-d there are other quantities besides the logarithm of the wave function which can be used for the analysis .      in order to obtain the phase diagram",
    "it is ( based on the above discussion ) sufficient to choose a particular and convenient value of the parameter @xmath51 , e.g. @xmath69 , the second moments .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the calculation of the higher moments , @xmath70 with @xmath71 , is important for determining the shape of the distribution of @xmath72 , but at the same time the higher moments of the on - site potentials beyond the second one must be considered .",
    "we will restrict ourselves here to the pair moments only .",
    "then the initial full stochastic problem eq .",
    "( [ recursion ] ) can be mapped onto an exactly solvable algebraic problem , in which the random potentials are characterized by a single parameter @xmath23 .",
    "two points should be mentioned : ( i ) we are at present not interested in the shape of the distribution which is influenced by the higher moments of the on - site potentials but in the problem of localization ( phase - diagram ) ; ( ii ) in the analysis of the moments of the amplitudes the localization of states finds its expression in the simultaneous divergence of the even moments for @xmath73 .",
    "because the second moment depends only on the parameter @xmath23 this means that the critical properties are completely determined by @xmath23 .",

    "( [ secondmoment_e2 ] ) the mean of the product of uncorrelated quantities was replaced by the product of the means .",

    "the causality principle has led to a set of linear algebraic equations for the second moments of the random field instead of an infinite hierarchy of equations that couple the second moments with the third ones etc .",
    "the set of equations is closed , but it does not include all possible second moments of the type @xmath82 ( this fact is irrelevant in the search for localization criteria ) . at this level",
    "the on - site potentials are also characterized by a single second moment @xmath83 only , which implies that the shape of the distribution does not matter for localization .",
    "information on higher moments is a crucial step for other models , e.g. , in turbulence and econophysics because the third and the fourth moments are linked to skewness and kurtosis of the distribution which are interesting features in these fields .",
    "equations for the higher moments can be easily constructed using the same causality property@xcite , but in the treatment of the anderson problem we restrict ourselves to the second moment only .",
    "the set of equations is exact in the sense that no additional approximations were made in its derivation .",
    "therefore , we conclude that at the given point the stochastic part of the solution to the anderson problem is completed and one has to deal further only with a purely algebraic problem .",

    "these fragments consist of localized charge that coexists with the surrounding metallic phase . as the density is lowered into the insulating phase , the number of fragments increases on account of the disapearing metallic phase.      the results of the present investigation - if it proves to be correct - have certain consequences for the validity of many theoretical tools used for the investigation of anderson localization in the past .",
    "our comments do not exclude the possibility that better theroretical tools in the traditional approaches can be found , which may better master the situation .",
    "our comments in the subsequent paragraphs are intended to highlight the differences between the present and previous approaches and the basic problems encountered by previous approaches - all this under the premise that the present analytical theory is proven to be correct .",
    "our first comment refers to the anderson localization as a critical phenomenon .",
    "one has always believed that all states in a 1-d and 2-d systems are localized for infinitesimal disorder , whereas in 3-d a metal - insulator transition occurs . from our studies it , however , emerges that a metal - insulator transition occurs in 2-d system .    because localization as a metal - insulator transition is a typical critical phenomenon , the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath44 are quite generally not analytical functions neither in the energy nor in the disorder parameter .",
    "it is well - known that perturbation theory is not a suitable method for describing critical phenomena .",
    "e.g. for @xmath246 and @xmath66 one has from eq.([gam ] ) @xmath308 . from this",
    "follows that the function @xmath1 can not be represented as a series in powers of @xmath83 .",
    "i.e. perturbation theory is not applicable to the anderson problem in 2-d ( as it is neither for other critical phenomena @xcite ) : the corresponding series expansions tend to diverge .",
    "this should be quite generally valid ; that is why all estimations which result from first order perturbation theory ( e.g. for the mean free path ) are physically extremely doubtful , because they are the first term of a divergent series .    in the case of 1-d systems",
    "it is known@xcite that in the limit of small disorder all lyapunov exponents @xmath309 . here",
    "perturbation theory is completely acceptable , because 1-d systems do not show a phase transition @xcite .",
    "these results of perturbation theory tend , however , to become inapplicable for higher spatial dimensions . in a similar vein",
    "it can be stated that results for the 1-d ising - model have no relevance for the 2-d model ( onsager solution ) @xcite .",
    "physics of disorder associates experimental quantities with quantities obtained by averaging over random potentials ( statistical ensemble of macroscopically different systems ) .",
    "this approach is well - known @xcite .",
    "one expects that , although the results of measurement of this physical quantity are dependent on the realization of disorder , the statistical fluctuations of the result are small .",
    "one assumes that physical quantities are only those which do not fluctuate within the statistical ensemble in the thermodynamic limit ( length of system @xmath310 ) .",
    "one defines these as self - averaging quantities .",
    "it is also known that in connection with localization this self - averaging property is not trivially fulfilled , e.g. the transport properties of the disordered systems are in general not self - averaging@xcite . here",
    "the fluctuations are much larger than expected or they even diverge in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "even though the existence of non - self - averaging quantities is known , the theory of the physics of disorder starts from the assumption that certain quantities will still be self - averaging and physical .",
    "however , one has to the authors knowledge never analyzed the conditions for the validity of this statement from the point of view of phase transition theory . in a system without phase transitions one can prove the existence of certain self - averaging quantities .",
    "their existence is also possible if there is a second order phase transition . here in the thermodynamic limit",
    "there exists only one or the other phase , a coexistence of phases is impossible by principle . in each phase there",
    "do exist certain average values which have physical relevance .",
    "strong fluctuations are observed only as usual in the vicinity of a critical point . in a system with a first order phase transition one",
    "finds certain parameter values for which two phases do coexist ; i.e. a macroscopic system is heterogeneous and consists of macroscopically homogeneous domains of the two phases . in this case a formal averaging over the statistical ensemble takes into consideration also an averaging over the phases , and the resulting averages have no physical meaning .",
    "physically meaningful are only the properties of the pure homogeneous phases .",
    "the trivial example in this respect is the coexistence of water and ice .",
    "an average density of this system has no sense and depends on the relative fraction of the phases , whereas the density of pure water and pure ice are meaningful quantities .",
    "formally systems with a first order phase transition do not possess self - averaging quantities .",
    "the well - known idea @xcite , to analyze such non - self - averaging quantities via probability distribution functions or all of its moments , can not be realized in practice .",
    "in the theory of phase transitions @xcite one has a general idea to treat such multi - component systems , but these exist only as approximations .",
    "one writes down the equations for certain averages . if these equations possess a multiplicity of solutions one interprets the corresponding solutions as phases .",
    "let us now consider the present solution of the anderson problem from this point of view .",
    "it is well - known that the exact equations of statistical physics are always linear but form an infinite chain ( e.g. see the equations which form the basis of the bbgky theory ( bogoliubov , born , green , kirkwood , yvonne ) @xcite . via decoupling approximations which use multiplicative forms of distribution functions",
    "( see e.g. the kirkwood approximation @xcite ) one derives from the insoluble infinite chain a finite set of equations which , however , are now nonlinear .",
    "this latter property leads to the multiplicity of solutions and the possibility to describe the phase transition .",
    "it remains , however , unclear in which way the original linear equations describe mathematically the phase transition .",
    "the anderson localization problem is the extremely rare case where an analytic solution was found for the chain of equations . as a result one",
    "can clearly see how mathematics produces a multiplicity of solutions in the form of non - analytic filter functions @xmath127 .",
    "the z - transform lifts the phase degeneracy allowing one to study the properties of each phase independently .",
    "particular solutions @xmath304 and @xmath305 can be naturally interpreted not as the result of full averaging over all realizations of random potentials , but as averaged over one of the two classes of filtered realizations . if a particular realization of random potentials for a given energy @xmath22 leads to unbounded sequences for all boundary conditions , we classify it as belonging to the first class .",
    "otherwise the realization of random potentials belongs to the second class .",
    "sorting of the realizations into two classes corresponds mathematically to an infinitely weak constraint on the on - site potentials , which are still characterized in the equations by a single parameter @xmath23 .",
    "therefore the equations for the second moments given above will describe both one - phase solutions with full averaging ( if the metallic phase is impossible ) and each phase of the two - phase solution separately with partial averaging .      for known technical reasons one treats d - dimensional systems as quasi - one - dimensional ones @xcite ; this is e.g. done for the recursive calculation of the lyapunov exponents .",
    "one starts with a system of the size @xmath311 : it is infinite in the @xmath312direction and the length @xmath313 in the other directions is finite .",
    "numerical scaling studies @xcite assume the scaling variable to be self - averaging .",
    "a further crucial assumption is that there is one - parameter scale function .",
    "one calculates the localization length @xmath314 as the average of the logarithm of the quantum mechanical transmission probability @xcite , and assumes that this quantity is self - averaging . for any finite length @xmath313",
    "the localization length @xmath314 is finite too .",
    "this fact is rather trivial .",
    "every quasi - one - dimensional system is qualitatively similar to a true one - dimensional one .",
    "because in the 1-d anderson model all states are localized , the same will hold for quasi - one - dimension systems .",
    "it is known that a rigorous theoretical definition of the phases requires the investigation of the thermodynamic limit @xmath310 .",
    "one assumes that in order to be extrapolate to infinite system size it is necessary to investigate the scaling behaviour of @xmath314@xcite .",
    "it is possible to establish a scaling function @xmath315 that does not depend on the disorder .",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath316 is a function of disorder .",
    "this method yields complete localization in 2-d dimension , and an anderson transition in 3-d case .     is the scaling parameter necessary to scale numerical data onto the same curve .",
    "values of the disorder @xmath23 are indicated .",
    ", width=302 ]    one notices that the idea of numerical scaling has a weak point ; one starts from the assumption that self - averaging quantities exist .",
    "the analytic solution presented in the present paper , section [ 2d ] , offers in principle the possibility to clarify the problems connected with the numerical scaling procedure .",
    "the analytic equations treat from the very start a system in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath317 ) , because the integer @xmath318 in eq.([schroedinger ] ) . a transition to a finite system ( @xmath319 ) in this context is rather trivial and corresponds simply to the transition from the fourier integral , eq.([ft ] ) to the fourier series .",
    "thus we arrive from the filter - function in the form of eq.([h ] ) at another equation : @xmath320",
    "the difference is large .",
    "the filter ( [ h ] ) has a multiplicity of solutions : the unit circle @xmath139 divides the complex plane into two analytic domains . for a finite system one has only one solution , the unit circle @xmath139 does not play a role anymore .",
    "the filter ( [ hl ] ) corresponds to only one phase , where all states are localized .",
    "mathematically this means that between the possible poles @xmath131 of the function ( [ hl ] ) there always exist the pole @xmath321 , and the filter is unstable . if one defines the localization length as @xmath322 , where according to the definition by using the second moments @xmath323 , then this length is always finite .",
    "the physical reason for this result is rather clear : in the @xmath161-direction the system remains infinite since the @xmath324-transform always `` feels '' the true asymptotic behavior .",
    "fixing a finite size @xmath313 in the @xmath155-direction effectively renders the system a one - dimensional one at large scales , hence the corresponding behaviour ( full localization ) . from this point of view",
    ", @xmath314 is essentially the crossover length form 2-d to 1-d behavior .",
    "let us do now a typical scaling study for the localization length @xmath314 at the band centre , @xmath246 .",
    "we have found that the scaling parameter @xmath316 is identical with the value @xmath44 , where @xmath325 and @xmath1 is defined in eq.([gam ] ) .",
    "disregarding for the moment the fact that one commonly uses a different definition of the localization length @xmath314 via the log - definition , we arrive qualitatively at the same results as numerical scaling@xcite .",
    "there exists a scaling function , fig.1 , which is typical for 2-d systems and whose behaviour one commonly interprets as complete localization in 2-d dimensions .",
    "the corresponding scaling parameter is , however , identical with the localization length @xmath44 in the insulating phase .",
    "i.e. numerical scaling is not capable to analyze a system consisting of two phases .",
    "this approach to the problem with particular solutions of different asymptotic behaviour , @xmath326 or @xmath46 , always sees only one diverging solution ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the basic idea of the present work is to apply signal theory to the anderson localization problem .",
    "we interpret certain moments of the wave function as signals .",
    "there is then in signal theory a qualitative difference between localized and extended states : the first ones correspond to unbounded signals and the latter ones to bounded signals . in the case of a metal - insulator transition extended states ( bounded signals )",
    "transform into localized states ( unbounded signals ) .",
    "signal theory shows that it is possible in this case to find a function ( the system function or filter ) , which is responsible for this transformation .",
    "the existence of this transformation in a certain region of disorder and energy simply means that the filter looses its stability in this region .",
    "the meaning of an unstable filter is defined by a specific pole diagram in the complex plane .",
    "these poles also define a quantitative measure of localization . thus it is possible here to determine the socalled generalized lyapunov exponents as a function of disorder and energy .    for pedagogical reasons",
    "we have analyzed in this paper first the 1-d case . here",
    "no new results are obtained .",
    "all states are localized for arbitrary disorder .",
    "the aim of this section consists in showing to the uninitiated reader a possible alternative to the traditional mathematical tools of dealing with anderson localization and to interpret its content .",
    "the power of the approach comes only to its full bearing when it proves possible to find analytically the filter function also for the 2-d case .",
    "although the filter is quite in general defined by an integral , it is possible to give a representation in terms of radicals . as a consequence we have been able to find an exact analytical solution for the generalized lyapunov exponents for the well - known and notorious anderson problem in 2-d . in this way",
    "the phase diagram is obtained .",
    "the approach suggested in the present paper does not in any way represent the complete solution to the problem of anderson localization in 2-d .",
    "the very important topic of the transport properties of disordered systems lies outside the presumed region of applicability of the method .",
    "the results of the studies give us a few answers to existing questions but open up even more questions .",
    "we have only considered the phase diagram of the system .",
    "the theory permits us to ascertain to which class of problems anderson localization belongs .    in the 1-d case",
    "all states are localized for infinitesimally small disorder in complete agreement with the theoretical treatment of molinari @xcite . in the 2-d case",
    "we have shown that in principle there is the possibility that the phase of delocalized states exists for a non - interacting electron system .",
    "this phase has its proper existence region and it belongs to the marginal type of stability .",
    "all states with energies @xmath327 are localized at arbitrarily weak disorder . for energies and disorder , where extended states may exist we find a coexistence of these localized and extended states .",
    "thus the anderson transition should be regarded as a first order phase transition .",
    "the argument of mott that extended and localized states can not be found at the same energy is probably not applicable in our case as the solutions for the two relevant filter functions do not mix .",
    "this has to be worked out in detail in the future .",
    "also the role of different disorder realizations has to be elaborated , which could be a source of the observed phenomena .",
    "our findings can in principle explain the experimental results of kravchenko et al .",

    "they are also in agreement with the experimental findings of ilani et al @xcite which showed the coexistence of phases .",
    "although one has to be cautious in concluding from our results directly onto specific experimental situations our theory is the first one to be in accord with experiment for 2-d systems .",
    "the qualitative diagnosis which we propose here is in several aspects different from the predictions of prevailing theories , scaling theory , mean field and perturbation theory .",
    "it has to be stated here that much work still remains to be done both via the present approach as via other established approaches .    1",
    ".   the anderson problem belongs to the class of critical phenomena .",
    "it is known from the scientific literature that in such a case one encounters in general a poor convergence behaviour of approximations @xcite , which in their basis contain a mean field approach . to cite an example : the exact solution of onsager for the 2-d ising model is in complete disagreement with the landau theory of phase transitions ( mean field theory ) @xcite .",
    "all critical exponents differ in the two approaches .",
    "yet there is at least a qualitative agreement between the two theories : the landau theory describes second order phase transitions and the exact onsager theory confirms this aspect .",
    "2 .   for the anderson problem the outlook on the theories",
    "might also be far reaching , if our approach should prove to be correct .",
    "all presently accepted theories derive here from the scaling idea which is in turn based on the assumption that the anderson transition belongs to the class of second order phase transitions .",
    "this basic idea is up to now a hypothesis which can not be proved in the absence of the exact solution .",
    "one has assumed that averaged or self - averaging quantities are always physical quantities .",
    "and every theory had the direct aim to calculate such quantities .",
    "our exact solution for the phase diagram , however , indicates that in this system the coexistence of phases is possible , i.e. that the anderson transition should be regarded as a phase transition of first order .",
    "3 .   for a phase transition of first order with a coexistence of phases there surely also exist self - averaging quantities , whose fluctuations are small .",
    "the quantities , however , tend to be unphysical because the average over an ensemble includes an average over the phases . physically meaningful in this case",
    "are only the properties of the pure phases .",
    "consequently one requires a new idea to calculate the transport properties of the disordered systems .",
    "we can at the present time only surmise that this future theory of transport properties will calculate the transport properties with the help of equations which have the property of a multiplicity of solutions",
    ". this theory should also formulate in a new way the average over the ensemble of random potentials in order to arrive at the properties of the pure phases ."
