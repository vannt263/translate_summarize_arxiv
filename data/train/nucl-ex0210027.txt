    "qcd calculations predict that high energy partons traversing nuclear matter lose energy through induced gluon radiation @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of inclusive charged hadron distributions in au+au collisions at = 130 gev show a suppression of hadron yields at high   in central collisions relative to peripheral collisions and scaled nucleon - nucleon interactions @xcite , consistent with the picture of partonic energy loss in a dense system .",
    "the fragmentation products of high energy partons that have propagated through the azimuthally asymmetric system generated by non - central collisions may exhibit azimuthal anisotropy due to energy loss and the azimuthal dependence of the path length @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow @xcite at @xmath7 gev / c measured at = 130 gev reaches the values predicted by hydrodynamical models based on the assumption of complete local thermalization @xcite . at high @xmath6 ,",
    "azimuthal distributions of charged hadrons exhibit a structure suggestive of fragmentation of hard scattered partons as well as an anisotropy with respect to the reaction plane @xcite .",
    "the new star data on the azimuthal anisotropy parameter @xmath8 for au+au collisions at @xmath1=200 gev extend the measurements up to @xmath4 gev / c and provide important constraints on the underlying mechanisms of high @xmath6 hadron production in nuclear collisions .",
    "the main tracking detector in star is the time projection chamber ( tpc ) situated in a solenoidal magnetic field of 0.5 t. the tpc has wide pseudorapidity @xmath9 and complete azimuthal coverage , with excellent momentum resolution .",
    "charged hadrons are identified by measuring specific energy loss @xmath10 for @xmath11 gev / c .",

    "the minimum - bias data correspond to @xmath15% of the geometric cross section .",
    "all tracks used in this analysis passed within 1 cm of primary vertex and had at least 20 measured space points .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy of an event in momentum space is quantified by the coefficients of the fourier decomposition of the azimuthal particle distributions , with the second harmonic coefficient @xmath8 referred to as elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 is inferred from the azimuthal particle distribution with respect to the estimated reaction plane orientation , corrected for the reaction plane resolution .",

    "similar to the results at 130 gev @xcite , @xmath8 rises linearly for @xmath11 gev / c , but saturates for @xmath16 gev / c for both methods .",
    "the @xmath8 values obtained from the four - particle cumulant method are 20% lower than those from the reaction plane analysis .",
    "this difference is attributed to the non - flow correlations in the reaction plane analysis , and we assign a one - sided 20% systematic uncertainty for the reaction plane @xmath8 values presented below .    figure  [ fig : ratio ] , upper panel , shows @xmath0 of charged hadrons obtained with the reaction plane analysis for minimum - bias collisions at 130 and 200 gev .",

    "figure  [ fig : ratio ] , lower panel , shows the ratio of @xmath8 from the 200 gev and 130 gev datasets . the elliptic flow is stronger at 200 gev for @xmath11 gev / c , suggesting a higher degree of thermalization .     of charged particles for different centralities at 200 gev.,width=294 ]     of charged particles for different centralities at 200 gev.,width=294 ]    in the saturation region at high @xmath6 , the magnitude of the azimuthal anisotropy is the same to within 5% , in contrast to the growth of the inclusive cross section with increasing  @xcite .",
    "this is an indication of the geometrical origin of the large anisotropies observed in the hard scattering region .",
    "figure  [ fig : charged ] shows the @xmath0-dependence for different collision centralities for @xmath17 gev / c .",
    "@xmath8 remains finite for non - central collisions , exhibiting a decrease from the saturation level at the highest measured @xmath6 for the more central events .",
    "it is expected that the azimuthal anisotropy will vanish in the limit of very high @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath8 values measured at @xmath18 gev / c for a restricted centrality range , corrected for contribution from non - flow effects , are consistent with the maximum expected @xmath8 from surface emission @xcite .",
    "a proposed explanation of the saturation of @xmath8 at transverse momenta @xmath19 gev / c is the dominance of baryons in this @xmath6 region described by non - perturbative mechanisms such as baryon junctions or hydro , while pion production is dominated by the quenched pqcd spectra @xcite . a qualitatively different @xmath0 behavior is therefore predicted for baryons and mesons .",

    "many different approaches have been attempted to describe the data , such as combining hydrodynamical elliptic flow with perturbative qcd including jet quenching @xcite , parton cascade @xcite , minijets @xcite , and surface emission @xcite . a simultaneous quantitative description of all the experimental data on high @xmath6 production at rhic , including inclusive spectra suppression , saturation of @xmath8 , and disappearance of back - to - back jets in central collisions @xcite , is needed . however , the data clearly point in the direction of qualitatively new physics phenomena in high @xmath6 particle production in nuclear collisions at rhic energies .",
