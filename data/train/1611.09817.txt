    "in the late 1990s , juan maldacenas s conjecture or ads / cft duality @xcite opened a myriad of possibilities in theoretical physics .",
    "this conjecute or duality teaches us how to relate a superconformal yang - mills theory @xmath2 with symmetry group @xmath3 living in a flat four dimensional minkowski space with a supergravity theory , which is the low energy limit of @xmath4 superstring theory living in a curved ten dimensional anti de sitter space or @xmath5 . after breaking the conformal symmetry one can build phenomenological models that describe",
    "approximately qcd known as ads / qcd models .",
    "this is done , for instance , in a model known as the hardwall , where a hard cutoff is introduced at a certain value @xmath6 of the holographic coordinate , @xmath7 , and a slice of the @xmath8 space is considered @xcite .",
    "this approach proved to be very fruitful to investigate hadronic physics , such as , regge trajectory studies . from the regge theory",
    "it can be shown that for some resonances there is an approximate mathematical relationship between their squared masses @xmath9 and their spin quantum number @xmath10 , given by : @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 constants .",
    "this idea can extended to bound states of gluons predicted by qcd , which have not yet been detected experimentally , called glueball states . using the holographic hardwall model the masses for even and odd glueball states and the regge trajectories for both the pomeron and the odderon",
    "were obtained @xcite , which are compatible with those found in the literature . besides , there are other recent works dealing with glueballs within other holographic approaches , see for instance @xcite . for non - holographic approaches , see @xcite .",
    "another well known holographic ads / qcd model is the softwall where a dilaton field is introduced playing the role of a soft cutoff .",
    "the main feature of this model is to produce linear regge trajectories @xcite . as was discussed in @xcite the regge trajectories for glueballs coming from the original softwall model although linear are not in agreement with lattice data . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proposed a dynamical modification of the softwall model for glueballs considering different dilaton fields . in the work @xcite a modified holographic softwall",
    "was proposed based on its dynamical version but being analytically solvable .",
    "this model was used to calculate the masses of the scalar glueball states and its radial excitations as well as of higher even spin glueball states from a single mass equation .",
    "one problem of this approach is that one needs different dilaton constant values for the scalar and high spin sectors .    here , in this work we perform a renormalisation in the five dimensional ads mass to overcome the problem mentioned above .",
    "then , we obtain from a single mass equation , with a unique dilaton constant value , the masses for the scalar and its radial excitations as well as for high even glueball states .",
    "the results achieved in this work are in agreement with others holographic and non - holographic approaches .    in order to make easier the comparison between our results and the results coming from other approaches",
    ", we will provide some values of the masses for the scalar glueball and its radial excitations ( see table [ tzero ] ) and other higher even spin glueball states ( see table [ thigher ] ) .",
    ".__lightest scalar glueball and its radial excitation masses expressed in gev from lattice .",
    "the numbers in the parenthesis represent the uncertainties . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     using the values found in table [ t1 ] , for the states @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we got the following regge trajectory for the pomeron in accordance with eq . :",
    "@xmath19 the errors come from the linear fit .    the plot related to the regge trajectory for the pomeron from eq .",
    ", using the data found in table [ t1 ] , is presented in the figure [ plot2 ] .",
    "in this work we have implemented an @xmath8 mass renormalisation in the modified softwall model ( which is analytically solvable ) in order to unify the spectra of the scalar and higher even spin glueball states with just one dilaton constant value .",
    "note that in the previous work @xcite a single mass equation for the scalar and higher even spin glueball states was obtained but to fit lattice data different values of @xmath20 were needed . here , with the implemented @xmath8 mass renormalisation this problem is overcome .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum obtained here in particular for the scalar glueball and its radial excitations fits better the lattice data summarised in table [ tzero ] than the ones presented , for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the calculated mass for the scalar glueball @xmath21 is too low in comparison with the literature .",
