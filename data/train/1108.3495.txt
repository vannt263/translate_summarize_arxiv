    "one of the many features displayed by self - organized collective motion of animals or individuals is the formation of trails .",
    "for instance , ant displacements are characterized by their organization into lanes consisting of a large number of individuals , for the purpose of exploring the environment or exploiting its resources .",
    "another example involving species with higher cognitive capacities is the formation of mountain trails by hikers or herds of animals . in both cases ,",
    "the main feature is that the interaction between the individuals is not direct , but instead , is mediated by a chemical substance or by the environment .",
    "indeed , ants lay down pheromones as chemical markers .",
    "these pheromones are sensed by other individuals which use them to adjust their path . in the case of mountain trails ,",
    "the modification of the soil by walkers facilitates the passage of the next group of individuals and attracts them .",
    "this phenomenon is well - known to biologists under the name of stigmergy , a concept first forged by pierre - paul grass @xcite to describe the coordination of social insects in nest building .",
    "the formation of trails by ants has been widely studied in the biological literature @xcite .",
    "one general observation is the fact that trail formation is a self - organized phenomenon and expresses the emergence of a large - scale order stemming from simple rules at the individual level . indeed ,",
    "ant colonies in the numbers of thousands of individuals or more arrange into lines without resorting to long - range signaling or hierarchical organization .",
    "another striking feature is the variability of the trail patterns , which may range from densely woven networks to a few large trails .",
    "this flexibility may result from the ability of the individuals to adapt their activity to variable external conditions such as food availability , temperature , terrain conditions , the presence of predators , etc .",
    "trail plasticity derives from internal and external factors : for example it may vary according to the species of ant under consideration or depends on the properties of the soil .",
    "our goal is to provide a model that accounts for these two general facts : spontaneous formation of trails , and variability of the trail pattern .    at the mathematical level ,",
    "several types of ant displacement and pheromone deposition models have been introduced .",
    "a first series of works deal with ant displacement on a pre - existing pheromone trail and focus on the role of the antennas in the trail sensing mechanism @xcite .",
    "spatially one - dimensional models do not specifically address the question of trail build - up either , since motion occurs on a one - dimensional predefined trail .",
    "one - dimensional cellular automata models have been used to determine the fundamental diagram of pheromone - regulated traffic and to study the spontaneous break - up of bi - directional traffic in one preferred direction @xcite .",
    "the decision - making mechanisms which lead to the selection of a particular branch when several routes are available have been modeled by considering ordinary differential equations ( ode s ) for the global ant and pheromone densities on each trail @xcite .",
    "these models do not account for the spontaneous formation of the trails . in @xcite ,",
    "the spatial distribution of trails is ignored in a similar way .",
    "however , it introduces the concept of a space - averaged statistical distribution of trails , which reveals to be very effective . in the present work ,",
    "we have borrowed from @xcite the idea of considering trails as particles in the same fashion as ants , and of dealing with them through the definition of a trail distribution function . however , by contrast to @xcite , we keep track of both the spatial and directional distribution of these trails .",
    "in general , two dimensional models consider that ant motion occurs on a fixed lattice .",
    "two classes of ant models have been considered : cellular automata models @xcite , and monte - carlo models @xcite . in the first class of models",
    ", no site can be occupied by more than one ant , while in the second class , ants are modeled as particles subject to a biased random walk on the lattice . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors introduce some mean - field approximation of the previous models : a time - continuous master equation formalism is used to determine the evolution of the ant density on each edge . in all these models , the jump probabilities are modified by the presence of pheromones .",
    "the pheromones can be located on the nodes @xcite , but the trail reinforcement mechanism seems more efficient if they are located on the edges @xcite . to enhance the trail formation mechanisms , some authors @xcite introduce two sorts of pheromones , an exploration pheromone which is deposited during foraging and a recruit pheromone which is laid down by ants who have found food and try to recruit congeners to exploit it . in @xcite , it is demonstrated that trail formation is enhanced by introducing some saturation of the ant sensitivity to pheromones at high pheromone concentrations .",
    "inspired by the observation that pheromone deposition on edges seems to be more efficient in producing self - organized trails , we suppose that laid down pheromones give rise to trails ( i.e. directed quantities ) rather than substance concentration ( i.e. scalar quantities ) .",
    "all these previously cited two - dimensional models assume a pre - existing lattice structure .",
    "one questions which is seldom addressed is whether this pre - existing lattice may influence the formation of the trails .",
    "for instance , it is well - known that lattice boltzmann models with too few velocities have incorrect behavior .",
    "one may wonder if similar effects could be encountered with spatially discrete ant trail formation models .",
    "for this reason , in the present work , we will depart from a lattice - like spatial organization and treat the motion of the ants in the two - dimensional continuous space .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a time and space continuous individual - based model for self - organized trail formation . in this model ,",
    "self - propelled particles interact by laying down pheromone trails that indicate both the position and direction of the trails .",
    "ants adapt their course by following trails deposited by others , therefore reinforcing existing trails while evaporation of pheromones allows weaker trails to disappear .",
    "the ant dynamics is time - discrete and is a succession of free flights and velocity jumps occuring at time intervals @xmath0 .",
    "velocity jumps occur with an exponential probability .",
    "two kinds of velocity jumps are considered : purely random jumps which translate the ability of ants to explore a new environment , and trail - recruitment jumps . in order to perform the latter ,",
    "ants look for trails in a disk around themselves , pick up one of these trails with uniform probability and adopt the direction of the chosen trail .",
    "this model bears analogies with chemotaxis models .",
    "chemotaxis is the name given to remote attraction interaction through chemical signaling in colonies of bacteria .",
    "mathematical modeling of chemotaxis has been largely studied .",
    "macroscopic models were first introduced by keller and segel in the form of a set of parabolic equations @xcite .",
    "these equations can be obtained as macroscopic limits of kinetic models @xcite .",
    "kinetic models describe the evolution of the population density in position - velocity space . in @xcite a direct derivation of the keller - segel model from a stochastic many - particle model",
    "the common feature of most chemotaxis models is the appearance of blow - up , which corresponds to the fast aggregation of individuals at a specific point in space ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , in the present paper , the dynamics gives rise to the spontaneous organization of lane - like spatial patterns , much alike to the observed behavior of ants .",
    "the reason for this different morphogenetic behavior is the directed nature of the mediator of the interaction .",
    "the model also bears analogies with the kinetic model of cell migration developed in @xcite . in this model , cells move in a medium consisting of interwoven extra - cellular fibers in the direction of one , randomly chosen fiber direction .",
    "as they move , cells specifically destroy the extracellular fibers which are transverse to their motion .",
    "the induced trail reinforcement mechanism produces a network .",
    "there are two differences with the trail formation mechanism that we present here .",
    "the first one is that the dynamics starts from a prescribed set of motion directions and gradually reduces this set , while our algorithms builds up the set of available directions gradually and new directions are created through random velocity jumps .",
    "the second difference is the role of trail evaporation in our algorithm , which has no equivalent in the cell motion model . indeed , trail evaporation is a major ingredient for network plasticity .    in the last part of the present work ,",
    "we derive a kinetic formulation of the proposed ant trail formation model in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "then , the fluid limit of this kinetic model is considered .",
    "we show that the resulting fluid model can exhibit trail formation only if some concentration mechanism is involved , while numerical simulations indicate that trail formation may occur without such a mechanism .",
    "therefore , the appearance of trails is enhanced when the model provides more information about the ant velocity distribution function .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    ", we provide the model description .",
    "section [ sec : simulation ] is devoted to the analysis of the numerical simulations .",
    "we establish a methodology for the detection of trail patterns from a simulation outcome , and analyze the dependency of the observed features on the model parameters . in section [ sec :",
    "kinetic ] , we formally establish a set of kinetic equations that describes the dynamics and we investigate their fluid limit . a conclusion in section [ sec : conclu ]",
    "draws some perspectives of this work .",
    "we consider @xmath1 `` ants '' in a flat ( 2-dimensional ) domain : each ant is described by its position @xmath2 and the direction of its motion @xmath3 .",
    "the vector @xmath3 is supposed to be of unit - length , i.e. @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the unit circle .",
    "we also consider pieces of trails described by pairs @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the trail piece position and @xmath8 is a unit vector describing the trail direction ( see figure [ fig : ant_saut ] ) . in the case of ants , the marking of the trail",
    "is realized by a chemical marker , namely a trail pheromone .",
    "we assume that the ants can distinguishably perceive the direction of the trail of this chemical marker and that they are able to follow , not the line of steepest gradient , like in chemotaxis , but the direction of this trail .",
    "note that in the case of walkers or sheep in an outdoor terrain , the marking of the trail is realized by the modification of the terrain consecutive to the passage of the walkers , such as flattened grass .",
    "for wild white bears , this modification is realized by the trail left in the snow by the animals . in the sequel ,",
    "we concentrate on the modeling of ant trail formation , and we will indistinguishably refer to these pieces of trails as trails or trail pheromones , or simply , pheromones. the set of pheromones varies with time , since new pheromones are created by the deposition process and pheromones disappear after some time in order to model the evaporation process .",
    "we will denote by @xmath9 the set of pheromones at time @xmath10 .",
    "the simulated ants follow a random walk process . during free flights , ant @xmath11 moves in direction @xmath3 at a constant speed @xmath12 , i.e. is subject to the differential equation : @xmath13 where the dots stand for time derivatives .",
    "this free motion is randomly interrupted by velocity jumps . when ant @xmath11 undergoes a velocity jump at time @xmath10 , its velocity direction before the jump @xmath14 is suddenly changed into a different one @xmath15 .",
    "the jump times are drawn according to poisson distributions . in practice , a time discrete algorithm is used , with time steps @xmath0 .",
    "with such a discretization , a poisson process of frequency @xmath16 is represented by an event occuring with probability @xmath17 over this time step .",
    "there are two kinds of jumps : random velocity jumps and trail recruitment jumps",
    ".    _ random velocity jumps . _ in this case , @xmath15 differs from @xmath18 by a random angle @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 , where @xmath19 is drawn out of a gaussian distribution @xmath21 with zero mean and variance @xmath22 , periodized over @xmath23 $ ] , i.e. @xmath24.\\ ] ] the frequency of the poisson process is constant in time and denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "_ trail recruitment jump .",
    "_ in this case , @xmath26 , is picked up with uniform probability among the directions @xmath8 of the trail pheromones located in the ball @xmath27 of radius @xmath28 centered at @xmath29 ( see figure [ fig : ant_saut ] ) .",
    "@xmath27 is the ant detection region and @xmath28 its detection radius .",
    "more precisely , defining the set @xmath30 ant @xmath11 chooses an index @xmath31 in @xmath32 with uniform probability and sets @xmath33 a variant of this mechanism involves a nematic interaction ( i.e. the deposited trails have no specific orientation ) . in this case , the new direction is defined by @xmath34 the nematic interaction makes more biological sense , since it seems difficult to envision a mechanism which would allow the ants to detect the orientation of a given trail . the use of a uniform probability to select the interacting pheromone can be questioned .",
    "for instance , the choice of the trail pheromone @xmath31 could be dependent on the angle @xmath35 like considered in @xcite , but in the present work we will discard this effect .",
    "ants may also preferably choose the largest trails indicated by a large concentration of pheromones in one given direction .",
    "this preferential choice will be discussed in connection to the kinetic and fluid models in section [ sec : kinetic ] but discarded in the numerical simulations of the individual - based model .",
    "the frequency of the poisson process is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of pheromones in the detection region of ant @xmath11 : @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the trail recruitment frequency per unit pheromone .",
    "the dependency of the jump frequency upon the number of detected pheromones accounts for the observed increase of the alignment probability with the pheromone density .",
    "of course , nonlinear functions of the pheromone density could be chosen as well .",
    "for instance , some saturation of the detection capability occurs at large pheromone densities , such as investigated in @xcite .",
    "this effect will also be discarded here .",
    "we also discard any consideration of the detection mechanism , such as discussed e.g. in @xcite .    .",
    "]    during their walk , ants leave trail pheromones at a certain deposition rate @xmath40 .",
    "if at time @xmath10 , ant @xmath11 deposits a pheromone , a new pheromone particle is created at position @xmath29 with the direction @xmath41 .",
    "hence , we postulate that : @xmath42 pheromones have a life - time @xmath43 and remain immobile during their lifetime . in this work ,",
    "pheromone diffusion is neglected .",
    "pheromone deposition and evaporation times are modeled by poisson processes : each ant has a probability @xmath40 per unit of time to lay down a pheromone and each pheromone has a probability @xmath44 per unit of time to disappear .",
    "pheromone deposition mediates the interactions between the ants .",
    "this interaction is nonlocal in both space and time ( because the ant which has deposited a pheromone may have moved away quite far before another ant interacts with it ) .",
    "random velocity jumps and trail recruitment jumps have opposite effects .",
    "random velocity jumps generate diffusion at large scales whereas trail recruitment jumps tend to produce concentrations of the ants trajectories on the pheromone trails .",
    "therefore , the pheromone - meditated interaction induces correlations of the ants motions and these correlations result in trail formation .    the trail recruitment process together with pheromone evaporation result in network plasticity .",
    "to illustrate this mechanism , let us consider the following simplified situation .",
    "suppose an ant reaches a `` crossroads '' of trails , meaning a spot where pheromones point in two different directions denoted by @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "suppose there are @xmath47 pheromones in one direction and @xmath48 in the other one .",
    "the probability for the ant to choose to orient in direction @xmath11 ; @xmath49 , is equal to the ratio @xmath50 .",
    "when the ant turns to its new direction , it may release a pheromone which will serve to reinforce this branch .",
    "eventually , one under - selected branch of the crossroads will vanish due to evaporation of the pheromones .",
    "note that the choice of the surviving branch depends on random fluctuations of this process : therefore , the outcome of this situation is non - deterministic and even an initially strongly populated branch has a non - zero probability to vanish away .",
    "we use experimentally determined parameter values as often as possible . since parameters are species - dependent , we focus on the species lasius niger.    in our model , the motion of a single ant is described by three quantities : the speed c , the frequency of random velocity jumps @xmath25 and their amplitude @xmath51 .",
    "these three parameters have been estimated in different studies @xcite which give us a range of possible values .",
    "we choose rather low estimations of @xmath25 and @xmath51 ( see table [ table : parameters ] ) since in real experiments the estimation of these coefficients counts both for random jumps and recruitment by trails .",
    "the deposition rate of pheromones @xmath40 and their life time @xmath43 have also been measured experimentally for lasius niger @xcite . after leaving a food source ,",
    "an ant drops on the average @xmath52 pheromone per second .",
    "this experimental value gives us an upper bound for @xmath40 because it corresponds to an estimation of @xmath40 in a very specific situation where the ant activity level is high . in our simulations",
    ", we use @xmath53 .",
    "since in our model , all the ants lay down pheromones , we also take a low estimation of the pheromone lifetime ( @xmath54 ) otherwise the domain becomes saturated with pheromones .",
    "by contrast , the interaction between ants and pheromones has not been quantified experimentally .",
    "for this reason , we do not have experimental values for the pheromone detection radius @xmath28 and the alignment probability per unit of time @xmath39 . in our simulations",
    ", we fix the radius of perception @xmath28 equal to @xmath45 cm ( corresponding roughly to 2 body lengths ) .",
    "the alignment probability @xmath39 remains a free parameter in our model . by changing the value of @xmath39",
    ", we can tune the influence of the pheromone - mediated interaction between the ants .",
    "a low value of @xmath39 corresponds to a weak interaction , whereas , for large values of @xmath39 , the ant velocities become controlled by the pheromone directions . in our simulations , @xmath39 varies from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .    for simplicity ,",
    "all simulations are carried out in a square domain of size @xmath57 cm with periodic boundary conditions . for the initial condition , @xmath58",
    "ants are randomly distributed in the domain .",
    "their velocity @xmath3 is chosen uniformly on the circle @xmath5 .",
    "the ant - pheromone interaction is always taken nematic unless otherwise stated .",
    "we can estimate the average number of pheromones @xmath59 at equilibrium , when the average is taken over realizations .",
    "the evolution of @xmath60 is given by the following differential equation : @xmath61 where @xmath1 is the number of ants , @xmath40 and @xmath43 are ( resp . ) the deposition rate and pheromone lifetime .",
    "thus , at equilibrium ( i.e. @xmath62 ) , the average number of pheromones is given by @xmath63 .",

    "a rigorous derivation of the kinetic model from the discrete dynamics is up to now beyond reach .",
    "issues such as the validity of the chaos propagation property @xcite , which is the key for proving such results , may be quite difficult to solve . then , fluid limits of this kinetic model will be considered .",
    "we will notice that the resulting fluid models can only exhibit the development of trails if some concentration mechanism is added , while the numerical simulations above indicate that such a mechanism is not needed at the level of the individual - based model .      in this section ,",
    "we introduce the kinetic model of the discrete ant - pheromone interaction on a purely formal basis .",

    "@xmath78 is decomposed into @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively describe the random velocity jumps and the trail recruitment jumps .",
    "both operators @xmath82 , @xmath83 or @xmath84 express the balance between gain and loss due to velocity jumps , i.e. @xmath85 . the gain term @xmath86 describes the rate of increase of @xmath87 due to particles which have post - jump velocity @xmath72 and pre - jump velocity @xmath88 .",
    "similarly , the loss term @xmath89 describes the rate of decay of @xmath87 due to particles jumping from @xmath72 to another velocity @xmath88 .",
    "the jump probability @xmath90 is the probability per unit time that a particle with velocity @xmath72 jumps to the neighborhood @xmath91 of @xmath88 due to jump process @xmath92 .",

    "indeed , the contribution of the largest trails is amplified and the ant flux becomes more strongly correlated to the direction of the largest trails .",

    "* we have shown that macroscopic models are unable to develop trail formation without some mechanism allowing to amplify the variations of the pheromone distribution function .",
