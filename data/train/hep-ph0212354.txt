    "the flavor problem in the gravity mediation scenario has to be resolved if it is going to descibe the soft terms of the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) successfully . in the 4 dimensional ( 4d ) supergravity models ,",
    "this has been known to be an extremely difficult problem@xcite . with the advent of new tries on extra dimensions@xcite",
    ", this flavor problem can be reconsidered toward a possible understanding of the susy flavor problem .",
    "the recent @xmath7extra dimensional scenarios are based on the hope that these extra dimensional field theories are obtainable from compactifications of 10d superstring models or 11d m - theory@xcite . in the early string models , it was argued@xcite that the gut scale , the string scale , and the reduced planck scale   are considered to be of the same order , under the assumption that a 4d susy field theory is obtained from a 10d susy field theory which in turn is considered to be a valid effective theory below the string scale @xmath8 . however , the string scale of order @xmath9 gev@xcite is known to be somewhat larger than the unification scale @xmath10 gev determined from the renormalization group running of the observed low energy couplings .",
    "contrary to this early prediction on o(1 ) number for the mass ratios , phenomenologically we need to introduce a small parameter , @xmath11 where @xmath12 gev is the reduced planck mass . initially , this small number has been considered to be a problem in perturbative string models .",
    "therefore , horava and witten proposed a relatively large @xmath13 dimension with two 9-branes with an @xmath2 group at each brane to interpret this small number@xcite .",
    "recently , friedmann and witten@xcite estimated  from the top - down approach with the 11d supergravity compactified with a @xmath14 holonomy . in this top - down calculation",
    ", they seem to obtain a small number if @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an appropriate ratio of the 7d compact internal space and 7/3 power of the 3d internal space of 7d supergravity , and @xmath18 is the o(1 - 10 ) number of the lens space .",
    "numerically , then eq . ( [ g2 ] ) turns up a number of o(@xmath19 ) . even though one can argue that the friedmann - witten calculation ( [ g2 ] ) is for a specfic model",
    ", it may have some truth in it if the volume of the extra dimension is relatively large .",
    "one notable difference of this calculation from that of ref.@xcite is that a 10d susy field theory is not considered as an intermediate effective theory .",
    "the recent tries of the extra dimensional field theories also do not assume a 10d susy field theory .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", it was pointed out in addition that for a 6d susy field theory between the string scale and the gut scale(@xmath20 compactification scale ) , one has @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath22 , then the scale  can be at most @xmath23 , which was the reason that ref.@xcite assumed that even in 6d a small number ( [ small ] ) is unreasonable .",
    "however , with a power - law asymptotic freedom above the scale , @xmath24 can be much smaller than @xmath25 and a large discrepancy between  and @xmath8 can be generated .",
    "this power law running was not used in ref.@xcite .    with a large internal space volume , many kaluza - klein(kk ) modes in the bulk",
    "can contribute significantly in the running of the gauge couplings , leading to a power law instead of a logarithmic running@xcite .",
    "if an effective 4d @xmath26 function contributed by the bulk fields is negative , the corresponding gauge coupling constant decreases very rapidly at shorter distance scales . this can be translated to a ratio between the compactification volume and an appropriate planck scale .",
    "thus , if the volume of the internal space is large compared to a planckian volume , there is a chance to understand the small number ( [ small ] ) .",
    "if the susy flavor problem is related to this small number , there is a hope to understand it with extra dimensions .",
    "indeed , kubo and terao@xcite investigated the possibility of solving the susy flavor problem using the small number ( [ small ] ) without introducing bulk matter .",
    "in this paper , we confirm their conclusion even with bulk matter , and obtain several candidate gut groups in 6d from the conditions on the asymptotic freedom and anomaly freedom .",
    "let us briefly discuss the kubo and terao(kt ) idea@xcite in higher dimensional susy field theory models , notably in 6d models . here",
    ", gauge multiplets are put in the bulk and matter multiplets are put only at the branes .",
    "to realize this kind of setting from string theory , the compactification creates matter only at the branes .",
    "however , we argue that it is not an absolute requirement to put matter only at the branes .",
    "an asymmetric assignment of matter in the bulk and branes can be more flexible in understanding top - bottom mass hierarchy@xcite , and still a kind of kt mechanism can work , since the essence of the kt mechanism is the asymptotic freedom of the gauge couplings in the bulk and the existence of kk towers from the bulk fields .",
    "note that the threshold effect of ref.@xcite relies only on the topology of the internal space , not needing a knowledge on the kk spectrum , which made it easy to write the answer in the simple form given in ( [ g2 ] ) .",
    "holonomy case since a detail knowledge on the kk spectrum in the bulk is not needed in this case . ]",
    "the orbifold compactifications toward 4d and 6d models are extensively tabulated in the literature@xcite .",
    "two explicit 6d models ( @xmath27 and @xmath1 ) are obtained by a @xmath28 orbifold compactification@xcite . here",
    "we study susy field theories in 5 or 6 dimensions , but with a keen eye on possible compactifications from 10d string theory or 11d m - theory .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that below the string scale @xmath8 particle interactions are effectively described by a @xmath29dimensional field theory with @xmath30 a small number .",
    "specifically , we will choose @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath8 may or may not coincide with the planck mass @xmath32 gev , but it is known to be close to @xmath33@xcite and we take this viewpoint .",
    "we also assume for simplicity that the grand unification scale  is the kk scale @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the compactification radius in the sense that the compact volume is @xmath36 with @xmath37 namely , the scales have a hierarchy @xmath38 thus , toward a 4d observer at low energy there arise towers of kk states above the scale @xmath39 . including these states in the running of gauge couplings between @xmath39 and @xmath8 , we obtain@xcite @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the beta function coefficient of the group @xmath42 contributed by all the mssm fields ,",

    "the kk sum is from the lowest one @xmath45 to the highest one @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the length scale describing the internal space is @xmath46 and the string scale is @xmath47 , giving a ratio of the compactification volumes as @xmath48 which is another way of saying that the small number ( [ small ] ) needs a large volume in the extra @xmath30-dimension . for the friedmann - witten case ( [ g2 ] )",
    ", we do not obtain this relation exactly even though a large volume effect must be there .",
    "the gaugino masses evolve as @xmath49 and the soft scalar masses evolve as @xmath50 \\delta^i_j |m_a(\\mg)|^2 + ( m^2)^i_j(m_s)\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the quadratic casimir operator , e.g. @xmath52 and @xmath53 . from the gaugino mass evolution ( [ gaugino ] )",
    ", we note that due to the small number ( [ small ] ) @xmath54 is large if the group @xmath42 is asymptotically free .",
    "then , if @xmath55 is small or comparable to the gaugino mass squared at @xmath8 , the soft mass term at the scale @xmath39 is dominated by the diagonal element due to eq .",
    "( [ soft ] ) .",
    "this relative enhancement of the soft mass from the kk mode contribution in the bulk is the kt scenario of suppressing the flavor changing neutral current . for this scenario to work ,",
    "_ one needs an asymptotically free gauge interaction in the bulk and a large internal space volume . _ in this case , it was also pointed out@xcite that the soft @xmath56 and @xmath57 terms tend to the flavor conserving points .",
    "we confirm that these conclusions are true .    as a numerical guide",
    ", we present the evolution of the gaugino mass in 5d in fig .",
    "1 with all yukawa couplings set at zero except that of the top quark . we chose a figure with 1.5 tev gluino mass at @xmath58 . here",
    ", we assumed the mssm spectrum between @xmath58 and @xmath39 .",

    "are obtained by running the unified gaugino mass(the gluino mass ) from @xmath39 down to @xmath58 . between @xmath39 and @xmath8 , a susy @xmath59",
    "is assumed with three families and two higgs quintets but without a @xmath60.[a geometrical breaking of @xmath59 does not need an adjoint higgs field . ] indeed , @xmath61 is a big number and softening of the flavor changing neutral current is achieved .",

    ".    0.3 cm    0.6 cm    [ fig : gaugino mass ]    0.3 cm",
    "for the kt scenario to work , the yukawa couplings should not behave in the same way as the soft mass behavior discussed in sec .",
    "namely , the yukawa couplings should not be diagonalized so that a reasonable quark mixing matrix is obtained .",
    "if there is no bulk matter@xcite , this differentiation is easily achieved .",
    "the main reason for this differentiation is that the soft masses are renormalized additively but the main contribution to the yukawa coupling renormalization is multiplicative .",
    "it is ironic to observe that _ the very nature of the additive renormalization of scalar masses needed supersymmetry for the gauge hierarchy solution , but the susy flavor problem created by supersymmetrization employs this additive renormalization property toward a solution of the susy flavor problem . _    on the other hand , if we introduce bulk matter , the discussion is more involved , which we show below . for the bulk matter",

    "we have checked the contributions of @xmath91 to the evolution equations are also negligible , and bulk matter can be allowed toward a successful kt mechanism .",
    "in the previous section , the softening of the susy flavor problem has been obtained by a large number of @xmath54 which depends on @xmath92 ^ 2 $ ] which in turn depends on @xmath93 .",
    "given the small number of order @xmath94 for @xmath95 , a larger @xmath30 can remove the unwanted flavor violating pieces more effectively .",

    "we have considered 6d groups with the asymptotic freedom in the bulk , toward softening of the susy flavor problem .",
    "we extended the kt mechanism to include the possibility of hyper multiplets in the bulk .",
    "the two conditions on the anomaly freedom and asymptotic freedom exclude most 6d gut models , except two @xmath4 models , @xmath5 models(one each for each @xmath6 ) , and several exceptional group models .",
    "the suppression of the flavor changing neutral current is obtained because of the existence of a small number ( [ small ] ) due to a large internal 6d volume compared to the planckian volume(or the string scale volume ) .",
