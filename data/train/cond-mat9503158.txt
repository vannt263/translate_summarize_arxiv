    "it has become increasingly clear that studies of magnetic ordering quantum transitions in metallic , fermionic systems will be of significant utility in understanding the properties of strongly correlated systems like the cuprates or the heavy - fermion compounds  @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to a recent comprehensive study by barzykin and pines  @xcite comparing such ideas with experimental data on the cuprates .",
    "we begin by discussing some background before introducing the question addressed in this paper .",
    "consider a metal in the vicinity of a transition to a ground state with spin or charge density wave order .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the order parameter field as a function of space ( @xmath5 ) and matsubara time ( @xmath6)the index @xmath7 for the case of vector spin density wave order and @xmath8 for the case of scalar charge density wave order .",
    "the long distance , long - time , zero temperature ( @xmath9 ) effective action for @xmath10 obtained after integrating out all the fermionic degrees of freedom takes the form  @xcite @xmath11 we have fourier transformed to wavevector @xmath12 and matsubara frequency @xmath13 , and introduced phenomenological constants @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; the ellipsis represent higher order couplings between the @xmath10 .",
    "we are considering here only the case originally considered by hertz  @xcite in which  @xcite the ordering wavevector , @xmath17 , is not a spanning wavevector of the fermi surface , and it is possible to connect at least two points on the fermi surface by @xmath17for a spherical fermi surface this last condition is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the fermi wavevector . in the language of a recent paper by one of us , chubukov and sokol  @xcite , we are considering only transitions of type @xmath20 . under these conditions ,",
    "the density of particle - hole excitations with wavevector @xmath17 are linear in energy at small energies , and this is responsible for the dissipative @xmath21 term in @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xcite terms are simply regular terms controlling spatial and dynamic fluctuations .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath24 term may be viewed as the simplest addition that makes the order parameter correlator have the correct @xmath25 decay at large frequencies .    in mean - field theory",
    ", @xmath22 undergoes an ordering transition when the landau - like parameter @xmath26 hence @xmath27 measures the distance of the metal from the ordered state ( we caution that an action like @xmath22 is _ not _ appropriate for @xmath28  @xcite ) . for the usual reasons , the mean - field transition has a correlation length exponent @xmath29 . at low energies",
    ", the @xmath21 is the most important term controlling the energy scale  comparing this with the @xmath23 term we get a mean - field value for the dynamic critical exponent of @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "later we will consider the solution of a model for such a transition in the limit of large dimensionality , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are not separately defined , but the energy scale exponent @xmath33 is .",
    "hence we prefer to quote the value of @xmath34 which is @xmath35 for the present mean - field theory .",
    "it has been argued on theoretical and phenomenological grounds  @xcite that , under suitable conditions , the nearly - ordered metallic state should exhibit a crossover at higher frequency or temperature scales to region with the effective exponent @xmath36 , or in mean - field theory , @xmath3 ( at the @xmath36 fixed point we still have @xmath29 in large @xmath37 mean - field theory , but @xmath38 in @xmath39 ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that this @xmath36 behavior is observed in the cuprates not only at very low doping  @xcite but also at moderate dopings  @xcite . in a simple mean - field analysis of @xmath22 ,",
    "the energy / temperature scale above which @xmath3 behavior appears is of order @xmath40 , as that is when the @xmath24 term starts becoming more important than the @xmath21 term .",
    "the question we address in this paper is the following : under what conditions does this crossover from @xmath35 to @xmath3 actually occur ?",
    "in other words , is there a reasonable scenario in which the crossover scale @xmath41 is significantly smaller than all other higher energy cutoffs of the critical behavior , so that @xmath3 behavior is clearly observable ? at sufficiently high energies the behavior of the system must become dominated by lattice scale cutoffs , and hence non - universal , and it is therefore important to have the cutoff @xmath41 be lower than such cutoffs .    we will answer this question here using the solution of a large dimensionality model of spinless fermions which has a charge density wave - like order parameter with a @xmath42 symmetry ( the solution uses recent progress in understanding the hubbard model in large dimensions  @xcite ) .",
    "our model exhibits a transition between metallic states with and without a mean value for the @xmath42 order parameter .",
    "we will show that there is indeed a reasonable scenario in which the vicinity of this transition exhibits @xmath3 behavior over a significant intermediate energy scale .",
    "although we will explicitly display results only for a specific model , our arguments are quite generic ; we expect that similar results apply to other models of ordering transitions in fermionic systems in infinite dimensions , including those with order parameters with a larger symmetry _",
    "e.g. _ the @xmath43 symmetry in spin density wave transitions .",
    "we now turn to a qualitative discussion of the region of parameter space where such behavior occurs . rather than introducing the infinite - dimensional model at this point ,",
    "let us discuss a more familiar example in two dimensions ; this example has the virtue of having phases closely analogous to all of the phases of the infinite - dimensional model ( and perhaps more ) .",
    "this will make the physical meaning of the phases transparent , allowing us , then , to jump directly to the phase diagram of the infinite - dimensional model .",
    "consider spin-1/2 electrons moving on a square lattice with first ( @xmath44 ) and second ( @xmath45 ) neighbor hopping matrix elements and short range repulsive interactions of scale @xmath46 which prefer spin density wave ordering at the wavevector @xmath47 ( see _ e.g. _",
    "we need second neighbor hopping to avoid effects from nested fermi surfaces . on general grounds we anticipate 4 distinct ground states for this model at half - filling :",
    "+ ( a ) metal  this is a fermi liquid whose fermi surface crosses the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "such a fermi surface is not nested and is also of the type in which spin fluctuations are described by an action like @xmath22 .",
    "+ ( b ) metal with spin density wave order  the magnetic order causes gaps over portions of the fermi surface , but the system remains metallic . + some details of the evolution of the fermi surface and critical properties of the transition between phases ( a ) and ( b ) were discussed in ref  @xcite . at very large values of @xmath46",
    "we can have two additional insulating phases + ( c ) insulator with nel order  all charged excitations are now gapped .",
    "the appropriate model for spin excitations is the spin-1/2 heisenberg spin model with first and second neighbor exchange  the so - called @xmath48-@xmath49 model .",
    "+ ( d ) insulating quantum paramagnet  or a mott - hubbard insulator .",
    "the @xmath48-@xmath49 model can have a ground state in which the magnetic order is short - ranged  @xcite .",
    "this state can also have spin peierls order  @xcite , but this is incidental to our considerations here .",
    "+ determining , in this two - dimensional model , the topology of the phase diagram with phases a , b , c , d , and possibly others , the nature of the phase transitions , and of the possible multicritical points , is a formidable problem which we shall not address here .    turning then to the large dimensionality model to be introduced later in this paper , we show in fig  [ phasediag ] its phase diagram .",
    "the phases are closely analogous to phases a , b , c , and d above and are labeled as such in the figure .",
    "the model has a charge density wave - like @xmath42 order parameter @xmath50 , but its role is analogous to the nel order parameter above .",
    "we are now ready to state the main result of this paper .",
    "we are interested in critical properties of the transition from phase a to phase b. consider the region of phase a which is close to the mott - hubbard insulator d. we identify this region as a ` strongly correlated metal ' , and has been shaded as such in the fig  [ phasediag ] .",
    "in such a metal  @xcite the fermionic quasiparticles are quite heavy and form a narrow band of width @xmath1 around the chemical potential .",
    "a large part of the single particle spectral weight is in the higher energy lower and upper hubbard bands . now consider the ordering transition from the strongly correlated metal to the metallic , ordered , phase b ; in other words , the transition from a to b , not too far from the multicritical point m. we shall show that in the large dimensionality limit , the order parameter fluctuations are characterized by @xmath51 only at energy scales below @xmath1 , while @xmath52 behavior takes over at the intermediate energy scales between @xmath1 and @xmath53 . for all energies below @xmath53 , and in finite , but large , dimensions , the action @xmath22 in eqn .",
    "( [ action ] ) is an excellent starting point for describing order parameter fluctuations and the crossover between @xmath35 and @xmath3 criticality , as examined in ref  @xcite .",
    "as @xmath1 can be made small by moving towards phase d , there is a significant window of intermediate energies with @xmath3 order parameter fluctuations .",
    "( for extremely small values of @xmath1 , it may also be necessary to consider the energy range between @xmath53 and @xmath46this regime also has @xmath3 criticality , but with a significant non - universal renormalization of the parameter @xmath54 in @xmath22 at the scale @xmath53 ) .",
    "these results suggest an intimate relationship between a low energy crossover to @xmath3 behavior , heavy quasiparticle bands , and the removal of spectral weight to the lower and upper hubbard bands  we conjecture that this relationship is more generally valid .    finally , we mention that a recent study  @xcite of liquid @xmath55he considers a large dimensionality model whose phase diagram has many similarities to fig  [ phasediag ] , and which also appeals to the proximity to a multicritical point closely anologous to m.    the infinite dimensional model will be introduced in section  [ model ] and its ground states discussed in section  [ ground ] .",
    "the main conclusions will be reiterated in section  [ conc ] .",
    "we motivate our model from the @xmath39 spin-1/2 model considered in section  [ intro ] . in the vicinity of the transition between phases a and b , we need only focus on the spin density wave order parameter and portions of the fermi surface which are close to pairs of points that can be connected by the ordering wave - vector @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath56 and @xmath57 be one such pair of points ; in general , there will be other pairs of points , usually related to @xmath56 , @xmath58 by symmetry operations of the square lattice",
    " these can be treated in a similar manner and are not considered explicitly .",
    "we introduce two species of fermions @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is the spin index ) representing fourier components of the electron in the vicinity of @xmath56 and @xmath58 .",
    "the low energy effective action for the vicinity of the boundary between @xmath62 and @xmath20 can be written as  @xcite @xmath63,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 , @xmath65 are the fermi velocities at @xmath56 , @xmath58 , and @xmath66 are the pauli matrices . after integrating out the fermions ,",
    "the effective action for @xmath10 should be of the form ( [ action ] ) .",
    "the dissipative term is of the form @xmath21 as long as @xmath64 and @xmath65 are not anti - parallel _ i.e. _ there is no nesting .",
    "we now abstract from @xmath67 the essential ingredients for a simple model of the ordering transition in large dimensions .",
    "first , we reduce the symmetry of the order parameter from @xmath43 down to @xmath42 ( the symmetry of a charge density wave order parameter ) by discarding the spin index @xmath68 .",
    "then , we replace the scalar field @xmath69 by an ising spin @xmath70its ` kinetic ' term then becomes a transverse field , @xmath71 .",
    "( for the model with @xmath43 symmetry , the ising spins in a tranverse field would be replaced by @xmath43 quantum rotors ) .",
    "finally , we place the system on a lattice ( not the same lattice for which @xmath67 was the continuum limit ) and write down the hamiltonian @xmath72 we have introduced the two pauli matrices @xmath70 , @xmath73 , an ising spin exchange @xmath74 , a chemical potential @xmath75 , hopping matrix elements @xmath76 and @xmath77 and a fermion - ising coupling @xmath78 .",
    "the parameter @xmath79 has different meanings depending upon the particular large dimensionality limit chosen  @xcite  for a regular @xmath37 dimensional lattice , @xmath80 ; for the bethe lattice , @xmath79 is the co - ordination number ; and for a fully connected cluster with random hopping @xmath76 , @xmath77 between all pairs of site , @xmath79 is the total number of sites .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath81 contains all low order terms consistent with the @xmath42 symmetry @xmath82 in the context of the original lattice model of electrons , this @xmath42 symmetry is simply the sublattice interchange symmetry which is broken by a charge density wave ordered state",
    ".    we will study in this paper the @xmath83 limit of @xmath81 .",
    "further , we will focus only on solutions of the mean field equations in which all sites are equivalent .",
    "this amounts to neglecting possibilities in which there is a staggered ordering of the ising spins @xmath70 .",
    "such solutions do occur , and are often lower in energy than the ones we consider  @xcite ; however we are not interested in them on physical grounds .",
    "one can also appeal to the fully connected random clusters for which the spatial uniform solutions are expected to be true ground states  @xcite .",
    "we will make an additional , final , simplification .",
    "we will work with models in which @xmath84 .",
    "although there is no symmetry enforcing this equality , in finite - dimensional , regular lattice models such an assumption would drastically change the physics of the transition .",
    "this is because , as will become clear below , for @xmath85 there are additional conserved charges which have a significant effect on the critical theory  @xcite .",
    "however at @xmath83 , all of the non - trivial critical behavior is in local correlators which are expected to behave in a similar manner for @xmath84 and @xmath86 .",
    "the numerical analysis required to solve the mean - field equations becomes much simpler at @xmath84 .",
    "we conclude this section by writing down the mean - field equations .",
    "the equations take their simplest form after performing a rotation of the fermionic fields @xmath87 under the @xmath42 symmetry ( [ symmetry ] ) we have @xmath88 and @xmath89 ; this makes it clear that we can simply think of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 fermions as moving predominantly on the two sublattices of the model underlying @xmath67 .",
    "for @xmath83 , the model is mapped onto a single - site mean - field hamiltonian supplemented by a self - consistency condition . following refs  @xcite , for @xmath92 for nearest neighbors on the bethe lattice , or for the fully connected cluster with @xmath84 random but @xmath74 uniform , the single site mean - field hamiltonian is @xmath93 we have introduced fermions @xmath94 , @xmath95 to model the environment of the site of interest .",
    "the couplings of these fermions and the parameter @xmath96 are determined by the self - consistency conditions  @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the fourier transform of the @xmath90 fermion greens function @xmath99 and likewise for @xmath100 .",
    "note that the total number of @xmath90 fermions and @xmath91 fermions is separately conserved .",
    "this is a consequence of the choice @xmath84 ; we reiterate that while such a choice and the additional conserved quantities would be dangerous in the finite dimensional theory , it s effect on local correlators in the @xmath83 limit is expected to be innocuous .",
    "this section will consider solution of the @xmath83 model @xmath101 in eqn ( [ hmf ] ) along with the self consistency conditions ( [ selfcon ] ) .",
    "we will consider subsection  [ atomic ] the exact solution in the atomic limit @xmath102 , @xmath103 , followed by a numerical solution of the @xmath104 , @xmath103 case in subsection  [ jeq0 ] .",
    "the most general @xmath105 , @xmath106 case will be considered in subsection  [ jgt0 ] .",
    "all of the sites are now independent .",
    "each site can have either 0 , 1 , or 2 fermions and the eigenenergies of @xmath81 can be easily determined .",
    "they are @xmath107 a key observation is that if we take the lower eigenvalue for each particle number , the states map exactly onto those of the hubbard model with @xmath108 . moving away from the atomic limit",
    ", the mapping of the low energy states to the hubbard model will continue to hold as long as @xmath109 .",
    "this mapping will be very useful to us in the subsequent discussion .",
    "we will study the ground states at fixed values of @xmath78 and @xmath110 as a function of @xmath71 .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath111-axis in fig  [ phasediag ] which presents results at @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "first consider the limits of large and small @xmath71 .    for large @xmath71",
    ", the ising spin flips rapidly between its up and down states as a consequence of the @xmath114 term .",
    "the value of @xmath70 averages out to zero , and the fermions effectively do not see the ising spin .",
    "the fermion spectral function @xmath115 is then simply the semi - circular density of states of free fermions : @xmath116 for @xmath117 and zero otherwise .",
    "one might also wonder why , for small @xmath71 , we do not expect the @xmath42 symmetry to be broken , thus causing the ising spin to pick a definite orientation and @xmath122 .",
    "this , however , does not happen for the same reason that the insulating solution of the hubbard model in refs  @xcite is not ferromagnetic .",
    "one can test instability towards ` ferromagnetism ' by measuring the response to an external field  even though the local susceptibility is infinite in the insulating solution , there is an internal field from the neighboring fermions which causes the net local effective field to vanish  @xcite , and the uniform susceptibility remains finite ; the reader is referred to the discussion in refs  @xcite for more discussion on this important point in the context of the hubbard model .",
    "we have numerically studied the crossover from small to large @xmath71 by solving the eqns ( [ selfcon ] ) using the exact diagonalization method  @xcite .",
    "we used as many as 8 sites each for the @xmath90 and @xmath91 fermions and worked at half - filling .",
    "the results were very similar to those obtained in the hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "we obtained two classes of solutions , a metallic solution present for @xmath123 and an insulating solution present for @xmath124 with @xmath125 . for @xmath113 and @xmath112 ( the parameters used in fig  [ phasediag ] ) , the energies of the two solutions crossed each other at a value of @xmath126 which was quite close to @xmath127 .",
    "we are therefore uncertain as to whether the metal - insulator transition was first or second order .",
    "however this issue is really peripheral to what we are interested in here , and so we did not do the necessary investigation of numerical fine structure to resolve it .    what we do care about is the behavior of the metallic solution for @xmath71 close to but greater than @xmath128_i.e _ the shaded region of the strongly correlated metal in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] . in this region , it is appropriate to use the continuous transition at @xmath127 to obtain a scaling description of the response functions .",
    "there is a low energy scale , which we denote by @xmath1 , which vanishes as @xmath71 approaches @xmath128 as  @xcite @xmath129 the scale @xmath1 controls the width of the quasiparticle band ( @xmath130 ) or the effective mass ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "our main interest here is in the behavior of dynamic correlations of the order parameter @xmath70 .",
    "its scaling properties can be deduced from the elegant critical theory of the mott transition provided recently by moeller _ et .",
    "( our model @xmath81 has only a @xmath42 symmetry and so the critical theory will be a self - consistent kondo - like model  @xcite but with a planar anisotropy in the exchange constants ) .",
    "for the response , @xmath132 , to a local field coupling to @xmath70 @xmath133 we have  @xcite : @xmath134 with @xmath135 a universal scaling function , @xmath136 is an upper cutoff of order @xmath78 or @xmath71 , and constants @xmath137 , @xmath138 contain the corrections to scaling contributions of the higher energy excitations associated with lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "the latter excitations have an energy @xmath139 and hence their contribution can be expanded in a smooth power series in even powers of @xmath13 . on dimensional grounds we expect @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "we show in fig  [ scaling ] a test of the scaling form ( [ chiloc ] ) using the numerically computed value of @xmath132 at four values of @xmath123the collapse of the data onto a single scaling curve is quite reasonable .",
    "the scaling function @xmath142 can be chosen such that @xmath143 and must satisfy the asymptotic limits @xmath144 for some positive constants @xmath145 . the non - analytic @xmath146 behavior at small frequencies is a consequence of the damping of spin excitations from the finite density of states at the fermi level in the metal , while the @xmath147 behavior at large frequencies follows simply from the spectral representation of the response functions in the critical theory .",
    "these asymptotic limits suggest the simple interpolation form @xmath148 which satisfies ( [ asymptote ] ) .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] a fit of the measured scaling functions to ( [ interpolate ] ) .",
    "it is apparent that the interpolation form works rather well , and that the accuracy of the numerical results is not sufficient to distinguish between the true @xmath142 and the approximate form ( [ interpolate ] ) .",
    "for the parameters chosen , the best fit values were @xmath149 and @xmath150 ; the value of @xmath151 is quite reliable , but the same can not be said of @xmath152 slightly different choices in the fitting process gave values of @xmath152 differing by a factor of 2 , but only a few percent changes in @xmath151 .",
    "however , @xmath152 always remained significantly smaller than @xmath151indeed , the linear @xmath21 dependence of @xmath135 is barely visible in fig  [ scaling ] .",
    "we had to compute @xmath132 at fairly large values of @xmath71 ( @xmath153 ) , lying well within phase a , before the metallic @xmath21 behavior was clearly evident .",
    "the scaling behavior of the @xmath154 susceptibility , @xmath155 , which determines the dynamic response of the @xmath70 to a spatially - uniform but time - dependent field acting on the @xmath70 , is somewhat more complicated ( note that since @xmath70 mimics the density wave order parameter at a wavevector @xmath17 in the physical system , the @xmath154 susceptibility of @xmath81 is really the physical staggered susceptibility ) .",
    "unlike , @xmath132 this susceptibility is finite at the transition at @xmath127  @xcite ; as a result the interesting frequency dependence of @xmath156 is really in a correction to scaling contribution . with the limited accuracy of the numerical method we are using , it would be quite difficult to obtain the scaling results from the data .",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves here to a qualitative discussion , which will be sufficient to extract the physics we are interested in . because of the similarity in the low energy structure of @xmath81 to the hubbard model ( in particular , the two - fold degeneracy of the lowest energy state @xmath157 in ( [ e123 ] ) in atomic limit )",
    ", we expect that @xmath156 will behave in a manner similar to the uniform spin susceptibility near the mott transition . from arguments similar to those in ref",
    "@xcite we may then deduce that @xmath158 behaves roughly like @xmath159 where the constant @xmath160 and @xmath161 is a dimensionless constant of order unity ( on the hypercubic lattice , the above equation actually requires @xmath162 ) . combining ( [ chiloc ] ) , ( [ asymptote ] ) and ( [ chiqz ] )",
    ", we can now deduce the frequency dependency of the uniform dynamic susceptibility : @xmath163 the first of these results in the energy range @xmath164 will be used below to reach the main conclusions of this paper .",
    "the exchange coupling @xmath166 plays a very simple role in the @xmath83 mean - field theory .",
    "it is apparent from eqns ( [ selfcon ] ) that in phases with @xmath167 the single particle green s functions are in fact independent of @xmath166 .",
    "the results at @xmath103 thus continue to apply for a finite range of values of @xmath166 .",
    "there is however a change in the @xmath70 correlation functions .",
    "it is not difficult to show , using an argument quite similar to that in the original curie - weiss mean field theory , that @xmath168 the finite @xmath166 uniform susceptibility therefore diverges at @xmath169 , which is the point we have onset of a nonzero @xmath170 .",
    "the phase boundary between phases a and b and between d and c in fig  [ phasediag ] was determined in this manner .",
    "the phase boundary between phases c and d requires computations in the phase with @xmath171 ; as this phase boundary is of no interest to us here , we did not carry out the rather involved computations required  the boundary between c and d , shown in fig  [ phasediag ] is just an educated guess .",
    "fig  [ phasediag ] also shows a multicritical point m , which is the point where all four phases would meet if the metal - insulator transition was second - order .",
    "the correlation functions on the @xmath172 side of this critical point are however simply related to those at the @xmath127 , @xmath103 critical point discussed in section  [ jeq0 ] : the single particle correlators are unchanged , while the relationship in the spin susceptibility follows from ( [ nonzeroj ] ) .",
    "the central interest of this paper is in the nature of the order parameter fluctuations near the phase boundary between a and b , at a point not too far from m ( fig  [ phasediag ] ) . from ( [ nonzeroj ] ) and ( [ zeroj ] )",
    "we see that the static uniform susceptibility diverges at @xmath173 , and the landau parameter @xmath174 .",
    "the nature of the dynamic susceptibility near the phase boundary between a and b also follows from ( [ nonzeroj ] ) and ( [ zeroj ] ) . from these equations we see that the infinite dimensional transition has @xmath35 at the lowest energies ; however this behavior is only present for energies smaller than @xmath1 , and @xmath3 criticality takes over for larger energy scales .",
    "observe , however , by comparing the two equations in ( [ zeroj ] ) , that there is a significant change in the coefficient of the @xmath24 term at a scale @xmath175 .",
    "we can in fact also make a crude connection between the dynamic susceptibility computed here and the finite - dimensional action @xmath22 for discussed in section  [ intro ] .",
    "one perspective on the meaning of the results for dynamic correlators in the infinite dimensional model is that these specify the input form of the effective action that must then be used to understand fluctuations in finite dimensions .",
    "with this point of view , our results allow us to deduce the following effective action for the order parameter @xmath10 in finite dimensions : @xmath176 where the @xmath23 has been added on phenomenological grounds and , as in ( [ action ] ) , the ellipsis represent non - linearities not explicitly displayed . from ( [ zeroj ] ) and ( [ nonzeroj ] ) we see again that @xmath177 , and that the two actions ( [ action ] ) and ( [ newaction ] ) have identical frequency dependencies in the frequency range @xmath178 where @xmath179 the insight gained from the present approach is that we now have an estimate of the scale at which the crossover from @xmath35 to @xmath3 behavior occurs  it is the small energy @xmath1 , as had been claimed earlier in the paper .",
    "the crossover itself is described by the action @xmath22 in ( [ newnewaction ] ) , which is an excellent approximation for energies below @xmath180 . in the higher energy range @xmath181 we should use instead the second result for @xmath158 in ( [ zeroj])this range still has @xmath3 behavior , but there is a non - universal crossover in the coefficient of the @xmath24 term at the boundary @xmath182 .",
    "so if @xmath1 is extremely small , this second regime of @xmath3 behavior will be the most important , and the very low energy regime of @xmath35 behavior will be unobservable .    before concluding , we also note that a similar approach can be used to describe the ordering transition between the insulating phase d and c. in this case @xmath183 and we are always in the second of the regimes in ( [ zeroj])the transition therefore has @xmath3 down to the lowest energy scales .",
    "this paper has examined a simple , infinite - dimensional model for spin or charge density wave ordering transitions in strongly correlated metals .",
    "we were interested in the case , originally considered by hertz  @xcite , in which fermi surface geometry was such as to induce a @xmath21 damping in effective action for the critical modes of the order parameter . as a result",
