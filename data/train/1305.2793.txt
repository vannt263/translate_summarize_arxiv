    "such interactions are very difficult to observe due to the extreme kinematic complexity present toward the inner galactic plane where most massive stars and snrs are found . over the last two decades it has been recognized that when oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers are found toward snrs they act as signposts for snr / molecular cloud interactions",

    "indeed , all 24 oh ( 1720 mhz ) maser snrs can be found in the @xcite catalogue of 34 snrs thought to be interacting with associated molecular clouds .",
    "the observational properties of these snr masers are quite different from those of hii region oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers .",
    "snr oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers have : ( 1 ) larger maser spot sizes ; ( 2 ) narrow and simple line profiles ; ( 3 ) low levels of circular polarization ( typically @xmath7 ) ; ( 4 ) low magnetic field strengths ( @xmath8 mg ) ; ( 5 ) relatively non - variable flux densities ; ( 6 ) a notable lack of any other maser species ; and ( 7 ) low luminosity @xcite .",
    "these observational facts can be explained if oh ( 1720 mhz ) snr masers originate in the post - shock molecular gas behind c - type shocks , and are collisionally pumped in contrast to their radiatively pumped hii region counterparts @xcite .",
    "current theories further suggest that the collisional pump is most efficient for post - shock densities of @xmath9 @xmath10 and temperatures in the range 50 k @xmath11 125 k , and that the abundance of oh must be enhanced by the dissociation of water due to x - rays and/or @xmath2-rays emanating from the snr @xcite .",

    "hence , as a powerful probe of snr / molecular cloud interactions , observations of this oh maser line can potentially pinpoint sites of particle acceleration .    of the known snr oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers ,",
    "the origin of those observed toward the w51 complex remain among the most poorly understood @xcite .",
    "w51 is composed of two large hii region complexes w51a ( also known as w51 main ) and w51b , as well as the snr w51c ( see the 90 and 400  cm images in figure  [ fig1]a , b ) .",
    "w51 is located near the sagittarius arm tangent point at @xmath12 and @xmath13 and thus velocity crowding in this direction has made distance determinations ( and relative orientations along the line of sight ) for the three w51 components ( a , b , and c ) uncertain . in the past ,",

    "a maser parallax distance has recently been measured for w51a of 5.4 ( @xmath14 ) kpc @xcite .",
    "additionally , the soft x - ray absorption seen toward the w51b region compared to the rest of the w51c snr suggests that w51b lies in front of w51c @xcite .",
    "however , it remains uncertain whether w51a is in front of , co - distant with , or behind w51b .",
    "the oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers reported by @xcite are located @xmath15 west of the w51b hii region g49.2 - 0.3 .",
    "subsequent observations of these masers by @xcite demonstrated that these masers exhibit all the hallmarks of snr oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers . like green et al .",
    ", these authors conclude that these masers are most likely excited by the interaction between the w51c snr ( the only known snr in the region ) and the molecular gas associated with the w51b hii region .",
    "however , the exact nature of this interaction remains unclear especially since snr oh ( 1720 mhz ) maser theory suggests that a sufficient column of oh with the necessary velocity coherence can only be achieved in shocks that move ( more or less ) perpendicular to the line of sight ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "it is difficult to reconcile the need for an edge - on shock with the fact that w51b lies in front of the w51c snr ( i.e. it seems that any shock would propagate with a substantial component along the line of sight ) .",

    "since no calibration source suitable for vlba observations was known at that time , a short vlba survey of near - by vla calibrators was carried out prior to the target observations . from this survey , the jvas source j1911 + 1611 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 with an uncertainty of @xmath22  mas ) had the strongest compact emission and was used to phase reference the maser data with a cycle time of 2 minutes ( this source is now available in the vlba calibrator catalog ) .",

    "absolute flux , bandpass , and coarse phase calibration at 400  cm were all obtained from observations of cygnus  a ( located @xmath31 distant ) .",
    "of particular note is the lack of accurate absolute position information for the 400  cm data due to the large distance to the 400  cm phase calibrator .",
    "typically this problem is solved by using a 90  cm image as an initial model for the 400  cm self - calibration . however , in the case of the w51 region , much of the total 90  cm flux is dominated by hii regions making it unsuitable for a 400  cm model ( 400  cm emission is absorbed by ionized thermal emission along the line - of - sight creating distinct differences in their morphology , see fig .",

    "at the resolution of the merlin data ( @xmath50 mas , p.a.=@xmath51 ) the two maser spots remain unresolved .",
    "however , maps of the velocity field of the two masers ( see figs .  [ mermom]b , and c ) are notably different , with the w51_1 spot showing a moire pattern indicative of no resolved velocity structure ( note the very small width of the displayed velocities ) , while the w51_2 spot shows a clear se - nw velocity gradient with higher velocities to the nw .",

    "thus , roughly 1/2 to 1/3 of the observed line width can be attributed to thermal motion , with the remaining line width is due to bulk or non - thermal motions .",

    "interestingly , only about half of the vla a - configuration integrated flux density is recovered by the merlin observations , while the vlba and merlin recover a similar integrated flux density .",
    "if these masers are non - time variable , this suggests that merlin and the vlba resolved out about half the total flux density .",

    "still these observations demonstrate that the range of expected densities and temperatures from the maser models are supported by the thermal molecular line data .",
    "first , to summarize the key multi - wavelength results : a non - thermal source of low frequency radio emission ( w51b_nt ) has been detected in the vicinity of the w51b oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers .",
    "this source is partially encircled by shocked molecular gas that is coincident in space and velocity with the masers .",
    "moreover , detailed modeling of the molecular emission indicates that the physical conditions in the pre- and post - shock gas are in good agreement with that expected from collisional pump models .",
    "it is also notable that the molecular gas associated with w51b_nt shares a similar lsr velocity with nearby hii regions ( for example g49.2@xmath1020.3 ) , suggesting that the masers are co - distant with the northern members of the w51b hii region complex .",
    "the non - thermal radio source is also coincident with a hard x - ray source and falls within the region of high likelihood for the position of tev @xmath2-ray emission , both of which have been suggested as necessary to produce enough oh abundance ( from water ) in c - type shocks for snr oh ( 1720 mhz ) maser emission .",
    "thus , the evidence indicates that these oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers are of the snr / molecular cloud interaction variety .",
    "the multi - wavelength data presented in this work suggests two possible scenarios for the nature of w51b_nt : ( 1 ) the non - thermal radio continuum emission , co shock , oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers , and hard x - ray emission are due to the w51c snr , which lies close enough behind w51b for its shock wave to have hit the hii region complex ; or ( 2 ) along this crowded , tangent point line of sight there is a previously unknown small diameter ( @xmath149 ) supernova remnant co - distant with the w51b hii regions .",
    "as will be described below , option ( 1 ) seems the most consistent with the full range of data available for this region .",
    "it is clear from both 4 m and soft x - ray absorption that the w51b hii region complex lies at least partially _ in front _ of the w51c snr .",
    "the key uncertainty is whether w51b is close enough to w51c for the snr s shock front to have reached its back side .",
    "in addition to the presence of w51b_nt and the oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers , there is further evidence that the w51c snr is interacting with much of the northern end of w51b .",
    "for example , @xcite report a filamentary arc of high velocity ( hv ) , shocked hi emission at velocities between @xmath150 km  s@xmath4 toward the northern section of w51b .",
    "this arc of emission begins just west of w51b_nt , curves around to the south , and ends just north of the hii region g49.1@xmath1020.4 .",
    "figure  [ hvhi]a shows the morphology of the hv hi compared to the 90  cm continuum ; the co(32 ) emission from the smaller field of view imaged with the jcmt is also shown .",
    "the arc of the filament matches very closely with the morphology of the 90  cm continuum emission in this region .",
    "@xcite also find hv co(10 ) emission roughly co - spatial with the hv hi ( most of the hv co(10 ) is outside the field of view of the co(32 ) jcmt data , see fig .",
    "[ hvhi]a ) .",
    "these authors suggest that the hv gas is tracing a shock interaction between the w51c snr and the molecular gas associated with the ( foreground ) w51b complex of hii regions .",
    "indeed , the hv hi does appear to lie along the transition between the unabsorbed 400  cm snr emission and the large scale filamentary molecular cloud associated with the w51b complex  the co filament is roughly coincident with the _ spitzer _ 8 @xmath19 m emission shown in fig .",
    "[ big]a , b ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite finds that the properties of the hv hi shock are consistent with a dissociative j - type shock , and further postulate that the post - shock gas is mostly atomic since the hv hi column density is quite high .",
    "therefore , the non - detection of hv hi toward w51b_nt is not surprising since it is spatially coincident with the oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers that are thought to arise in non - dissociative c - type shocks @xcite .    another piece of evidence indicating a more extensive interaction is the morphology of the 400  cm emission . in particular , the non - thermal 400  cm emission appears to both encircle and partially overlap with the g49.2@xmath1020.3 hii region emission as defined by the shorter wavelength 21  cm image ( see figs.[zoom]a , b ) .",
    "as described , for example , in @xcite and @xcite , relatively little thermal ionized gas is required to absorb 400  cm emission so it would be surprising to detect such low frequency emission in the direction of a foreground hii region .",
    "this expectation can be quantified by comparing an estimate of the 400  cm free - free continuum opacity from the hii region with the observed 400  cm emission .",
    "the 400  cm opacity was calculated by first convolving the c+d 21  cm continuum image to the 400  cm image resolution of @xmath151 , and then converting this image to brightness temperature .",
    "next the @xmath152 was calculated from @xmath153 assuming an electron temperature of 10,000 k , and then extrapolated to @xmath154 using @xmath155 . using this method , we find a peak 400  cm opacity of 22.5 with @xmath156 extending well into the observed 400  cm emission , see figure  [ hvhi]b .",
    "of course , in reality the @xmath157 within the hii region is unlikely to be constant , but the relatively high assumed value yields a lower limit to @xmath152 .",
    "the strongest observed 400  cm emission is on the eastern side of w51c at 1.35 jy  beam@xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "since it seems unlikely that the unabsorbed 400  cm emission underlying the hii region is significantly brighter than this intensity , we take it to be an upper limit to the unabsorbed 400  cm non - thermal emission toward g49.2@xmath1020.3 .",
    "when this assumption is coupled with the @xmath158 rms noise of the 400  cm image of 0.3 jy  beam@xmath4 , we find that lines of sight with @xmath159 would be undetectable _ if the hii region lies entirely in front of the 400  cm non - thermal emission_. however , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ hvhi]b detectable 400  cm emission is observed toward regions with @xmath154 up to @xmath160 ! this analysis suggests , as does the morphology , that in fact the w51c snr has partially enveloped the g49.2@xmath1020.3 hii region .",
    "interestingly , from analysis of the optical extinction toward the w51b region , @xcite found that the northern half of w51b is more heavily extincted than the south / southwestern end . since the total molecular column density is actually larger to the sw , these authors ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that the northern end of w51b is tilted deeper into the cloud than the south / southwestern end , placing it closer to w51c . from all of these comparisons",
    "it seems clear that the w51c snr is interacting with the northern part of the w51b hii region complex .      as a shock propagates ,",
    "the gas is compressed in the direction the shock is moving and the component of the magnetic field parallel to the shock front will be amplified . for collisionally",
    "pumped maser emission it is further expected that the shock must be moving more or less perpendicular to our line - of - sight in order to assure adequate velocity coherence , and column density along the line - of - sight .",
    "thus , collisionally pumped masers like oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers associated with snrs and class i ch@xmath61oh masers are always found near the systemic velocity .",
    "these two facts together imply that the magnetic field vector is oriented somewhere in the plane perpendicular to the direction the shock front is moving , and we are viewing that shock front edge - on . using this as the starting geometry , one would like to use the polarization measurements to constrain the direction of the magnetic field vector and the value of @xmath93 in the @xmath85@xmath91@xmath92equation .",
    "maser propagation theory ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as mentioned above , we expect that @xmath92 lies parallel to the plane of the shock front ( perpendicular to its direction of motion ) , and in principle the orientation of the shock front itself can be discerned from the morphology of the shocked co(32 ) emission .",

    "the observed polarized intensity could be a lower limit to the true intensity , owing to the factors mentioned by @xcite , including including faraday depolarization and tangling of the magnetic field lines within the masing region .",
