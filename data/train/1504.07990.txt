    "recent observational and theoretical results have shown that a peak of the star formation rate ( @xmath6 ) appears between z @xmath12 - 3 , decreasing to the present epoch ( bouwens et al .",
    "2011 , burgarella et al .",
    "2013 , behroozi et al .",
    "2013 and references therein ) .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that evolution of bimodality in colour distribution is clearly observed , showing that the fraction of red massive ( i.e. early type ) galaxies with quenched star formation is higher at z@xmath1 0 than in the earlier epochs .",
    "star formation rate also depends on the environmental density , assuming that quenching of star formation is more efficient in high density regions ( cucciati et al .",
    "2006 , scoville et al .",
    "2013 , tal et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the dominant factor of quenching is different for the high mass ( central ) and low mass ( satellite ) galaxies . according to findings by peng et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2012 ) , the former galaxies preferred the self - regulated `` mass quenching '' , while quenching in latter galaxies occurred mainly due to environmental and/or merging influence ( see also tinker et al .",
    "2013 , tal et al .",
    "2014 , wetzel et al .",
    "2014 ) . however , the physical mechanisms of internal `` mass quenching '' are still under discussion .",
    "it would appear that active galactive nuclei ( agn ) feedback is the dominant regime for internal mass quenching .",
    "occurring in high mass galaxies , it consists in kinematic outflows ( winds ) from the accretion disk surrounding the black hole .",
    "this removes the cold gas from the galaxies , terminating the star formation .",
    "the theoretical underpinnings of the importance of this process are described by khalatyan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , dubois et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and others .",
    "the observational evidence is summarized in fabian ( 2012 ) , see also a statistical study by lemaux et al .",
    "it is also noted that radio feedback observed in radio - loud agn plays an important role in the host galaxy star formation quenching , see for example croton et al .",
    "for example , schawinski et al .",
    "( 2014 ) argues in a that agn feedback is a key factor accompanying spiral galaxy merging for quenched elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "apparently this process could explain a formation of isolated / void early type galaxies , where an influence of environment is minimal ( croton & farrar 2008 ) .",
    "it is thought that agn feedback influence could also be positive , triggering star formation on shorter timescales ( zinn et al .",
    "2013 , zubovas 2013 ) .",
    "in addition to minor and major mergings , the processes of ram pressure stripping , harassment and strangulation facilitate environmental quenching .",
    "relatively slow strangulation , where a galaxy loses its gas due to tidal effects produced by the gravitational potential of the group / cluster seems to be a more effective quenching mechanism than others ( van den bosch et al .",
    "2008 , taranu et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "an effective method for the study of environmental impact upon galaxy evolution is to compare the properties of galaxies from dense environments with corresponding properties of isolated galaxies , i.e. objects that have not been appreciably affected by an external influence of their environments for at least a few gyr ( see verley et al . 2007 , karachentseva et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this has been confirmed by comparison between modelling results and observations , revealing that properties of isolated galaxies have been mainly influenced by internal processes .",
    "hirschmann et al .",
    "( 2013 ) showed that only 45% of isolated galaxies have experienced at least one merger event in the past ( most of the mergers are minor , with mass ratios between 1:4 and 1:10 ) .",

    "the 2mig entire sky catalogue of isolated galaxies ( karachentseva et al .",
    "2010 ) was selected from 1.6 million objects of the 2mass xsc ( jarrett et al .",
    "selection of objects was performed twice :    \\(i ) automatically according to the original criteria of isolation by karachentseva ( 1973 ) adapted to the 2mass data :    @xmath11    and    @xmath12    where subscripts `` 1 '' and",
    "`` i '' refer to the fixed galaxy and its neighbours , respectively .",

    "\\(ii ) visual inspecting of the images ( dss1,2 and sdss ) of all isolated candidates to identify visible neighbours .",
    "visual inspection allowed us to physically eliminate multiple systems with blue neighbours missed in the automatic selection ( see details in karachentseva et al .",
    "2010 ) . finally , the 2mig catalogue consists of 3227 galaxies brighter than @xmath17 = 12 mag and with angular diameters @xmath18 30@xmath19 .",
    "we found approximately 6% of isolated galaxies among the 51572 extended sources of the 2mass xsc survey .    in total , 2869 from",
    "the 3227 2mig galaxies have radial velocities according to the ned and hyperleda databases .",
    "we removed 23 galaxies from the 2mig list due to the presence of significant companions in their neighbourhood , or otherwise their protometry was contaminated by a projected star : 2mig90 , 174 , 243 , 320 , 586 , 1137 , 1172 , 1548 , 1809 , 1819 , 1822 , 1949 , 1970 , 1988 , 2242 , 2243 , 2249 , 2285 , 2585 , 2976 , 2989 , 3143 , 3193 , 3201 .",
    "therefore , in this paper we consider only 1616 isolated galaxies having fuv magnitudes ( see next subsection ) .",

    "we note that near 7% of the catalogue galaxies have different morphologies in comparison to the types noted in primary 2mig catalogue ( karachentseva et al .",
    "these morphological types were revised according to sdss dr10 images and the classification used by coziol et al .",

    "( 2014 ) .",
    "the isolated galaxies for the log list were selected from the primary catalogue of @xmath111000 galaxies within the volume of the local supercluster @xmath203500 km / s at the galactic latitudes @xmath21 . at first , only galaxies from the primary galaxy catalogue of the virialized groups were selected . for that ,",
    "makarov & karachentsev ( 2011 ) used a modified percolation method .",
    "this takes into account the individual characteristics of galaxies and the following conditions :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the velocity difference between two galaxies , @xmath24 is the corresponding projected distance , @xmath25 is the gravitational constant and @xmath26 is the total mass of the pair .",
    "each galaxy mass was calculated using condition @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the 2mass @xmath29 band luminosity while @xmath30=6 is the empirical coefficient .",
    "the condition ( 3 ) means that a total energy of the physical pair must be negative and supplemented by condition ( 4 ) , according to which the pair of components should remain within the sphere of zero - velocity :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the hubble constant .",
    "all the pairs satisfying conditions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) with a common main component were combined into a group .",
    "therefore , a primary sample of @xmath111000 galaxies was divided into `` clusterized '' galaxies , i.e. 54% are located in virialized groups , and `` non - clusterized '' galaxies .",
    "the candidates for isolated galaxies were chosen by application of the clusterization algorithm to all galaxies with empirical coefficient @xmath33 40=240 .",
    "if , at this strong condition , a galaxy still remained `` non - clustered '' it was considered as a candidate to the isolated one ( see more details in karachentsev et al .",
    "2011 ) . among 990 isolated candidates ,",
    "the true isolated galaxies were chosen by application of the karachentseva ( 1973 ) selection criteria , i.e. visual inspection of all targets and their environments . as a result ,",

    "in the paper we have considered the star formation properties of 1616 isolated galaxies from the 2mig catalogue ( karachentseva et al .",
    "2010 ) with fuv magnitudes .",
    "the star formation rates ( @xmath6 ) and specific star formation rates ( @xmath0 ) of 2mig galaxies were compared with corresponding properties of isolated galaxies from the log catalogue ( karachentsev et al . 2011 ) and with paired galaxies ( wp  wide pairs and cp  the most compact pairs with velocity difference less than 150 km / s and a projected distance less than 50 kpc ) . we summarize our main findings below :    \\1 .",
    "different selection algorithms applied to different primordial samples define different populations of isolated galaxies .",
    "the population of the log catalogue , selected from the local supercluster non - clustered galaxies , mostly consists of spiral and late type galaxies .",
    "these are up to two orders of magnitude less massive than the 2mig galaxies of corresponding morphology .",
    "the 2mig population , in ontrast , was selected from the 2masx ( jarrett et al .",
    "2000 ) within quite bright near - infrared galaxies ( @xmath3512 mag and angular diameters @xmath18 30@xmath19 ) consisting of normal mass galaxies , predominantly of early spirals .",
    "late type galaxies of both samples have almost the same amount of gas at present epochs though the gas fraction in spiral and early type galaxies of the 2mig sample is much smaller and will be consumed over less time than @xmath36 . in general , the @xmath6 vs. @xmath4 and @xmath0 vs. @xmath4 relations of the log sample complete 2mig corresponding relation to lower masses .",
    "the @xmath0 upper limit in all considered galaxy samples ( i.e. isolated and paired ) of the local universe ( at least at z@xmath20.06 ) does not exceed the value of @xmath1dex(-9.4 ) .",
    "this is probably common for galaxies of differing activity located in different types of environments ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2013 , karachentsev and kaisina 2013 , karachentseva et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the fractions of quenched ( q , with fuv - k ( ab ) @xmath37 6.6 ) galaxies of 10.5@xmath2log@xmath3811.5 masses are nearly twice as high in the paired galaxy sample than among the 2mig isolated galaxies .",
    "this suggests that quenching proved more effective in higher density regions in the past ( cucciati et al .",
    "2006 , scoville et al .",
    "2013 , tal et al .",
    "2014 ) . from the behaviour of @xmath6 vs. @xmath4 relations we concluded that the main factor of evolutionary processes is defined by the galaxy mass",
    "however , the environmental influence is notable : the 2mig s and pair s main sequence ( non - quenched with fuv - k ( ab ) @xmath2 6.6 ) galaxies have different gradients : the relation for the former sample is smaller than the latter , i.e. the paired galaxies have somewhat lower @xmath6 and @xmath0 at low masses and higher @xmath6 and @xmath0 for the massive galaxies with log@xmath511.5 .",
    "the student s t - test showed that the difference is significant only for the high - mass end .",
    "therefore we suggest , that the environment triggers star formation in the highest mass galaxies . moreover , the values of @xmath6 and @xmath0 are higher in general for galaxies in the most closely spaced pairs suggesting the outgoing interactions .",
    "the existence of a significant fraction of quenched isolated galaxies ( 21% ) reveals that the main quenching mechanism probably does not depend on the environmental density .",
    "the similarity of the mean values of the @xmath6 and gradients in @xmath6 vs. @xmath4 ( also in @xmath0 vs. @xmath4 ) relations for quenched 2mig and paired galaxies also support the assumption that the dominant quenching mechanism is similar for galaxies located in all type of environments and depend mainly upon the galaxy mass ( possibly the main driving mechanism is agn feedback croton & farrar 2008 , see also discussion in peng et al .",
    "2010 and schawinski et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "we found that the fraction of agn in paired samples is a little higher ( but not significantly in the statistical sense ) than in our isolated galaxy sample .",
    "we suggest that agn phenomenon is not necessarily connected with environmental density and , most probably , defined by secular galaxy evolution confirming the previous results by coziol et al .",

    "<S> we have considered the star formation properties of 1616 isolated galaxies from the 2mass xsc selected sample ( 2mig ) with the fuv galex magnitudes . this sample </S>",
    "<S> was then compared with corresponding properties of isolated galaxies from the local orphan galaxies catalogue ( log ) and paired galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> we found that different selection algorithms define different populations of isolated galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the population of the log catalogue , selected from non - clustered galaxies in the local supercluster volume , mostly consists of low - mass spiral and late type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 upper limit in isolated and paired galaxies does not exceed the value of @xmath1dex(-9.4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is probably common for galaxies of differing activity and environment ( at least at z@xmath20.06 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fractions of quenched galaxies are nearly twice as high in the paired galaxy sample as in the 2mig isolated galaxy sample . from the behaviour of @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 relations we deduced that the characteristic value influencing evolutionary processes is the galaxy mass . </S>",
    "<S> however the environmental influence is notable : paired massive galaxies with log@xmath511.5 have higher @xmath3 than isolated galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the environment helps to trigger the star formation in the highest mass galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the fraction of agn in the paired sample is only a little higher than in our isolated galaxy sample . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that agn phenomenon is probably defined by secular galaxy evolution .    </S>",
