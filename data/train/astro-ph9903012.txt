    "a foreground star is projected on the host galaxy at a distance of 6 arcsec to the nucleus in north - east direction ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "therefore , it has been supposed in some early papers that mkn  110 might be a double nucleus galaxy ( petrosian et al .  1978 ) .",
    "on the other hand the peculiar morphology of mkn  110 is an indication for a recent interaction and/or merging event in this galaxy ( hutchings & craven 1988 ) .",
    "one can clearly recognize a tidal arm to the west with a projected length of 50 arcsec ( corresponding to 35 kpc ) and further signs of asymmetry in the disturbed host galaxy on the r - band image ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "ten years ago we started a long - term variability campaign to study the continuum and emission line intensity variations in selected agns .",

    "the spectra were obtained at calar alto observatory in spain with the 2.2  m and 3.5  m telescopes as well as at mcdonald observatory in texas with the 2.1  m and 2.7  m telescopes .",
    "the individual exposure times range from 10 minutes to 1 hour ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we used spectrograph slits with projected widths of 2 to 2.5 arcsec and 2 arcmin length under typical seeing conditions of 1 to 2 arcsec .",
    "we extracted spectra of the central 5 arcsec .",
    "the slit was oriented in north - south direction in most cases .    to investigate the spatial extension of the narrow line region we took spectra at different position angles : 0@xmath5 , 45@xmath5 , 90@xmath5 , and 135@xmath5 . a possible extended [ oiii]@xmath05007 emission line flux was always less than 3% of the nuclear point - like emission .",

    "this is a further indication that the broad - line regions in agn are structured as e.g. in ngc  4593 ( kollatschny & dietrich 1997 ) . in fig .",
    "12 it is shown that during the first half of our campaign a red line component was present in the h@xmath9 spectra .",
    "this component was not visible during the second half of the campaign .",
    "the size of the h@xmath4 line emitting region ( r  =  40 ld corresponding to 1.0 10@xmath37 cm ) and the optical continuum luminosity is compared to those of other seyfert galaxies .",
    "the continuum luminosity amounts to @xmath38 erg s@xmath3@xmath3 . in this case",
    "we used @xmath39 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 in order to compare directly the radius and luminosity of mkn  110 with those of other seyfert galaxies compiled by carone et al .",
    "the values of mkn  110 fit nicely into the general radius - luminosity relationship for the broad - line regions in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the balmer line emitting region as well as the luminosity of mkn  110 are arranged in the upper region of the radius - luminosity plane close to the galaxies mkn  590 and mkn  335 .",
    "there is a trend that the broader emission lines originate closer to the center ( see table 7 ) .",
    "a similar trend was found for ngc  5548 , too ( kollatschny & dietrich 1996 ) .",
    "the central mass in mkn  110 can be estimated from the width of the broad emission line profiles ( fwhm ) under the assumption that the gas dynamics are dominated by the central massive object .",
    "furthermore , one needs the distance of the dominant emission line clouds to the ionizing central source ( e.g. koratkar & gaskell 1991 , kollatschny & dietrich 1997 ) .",
    "we presume that the characteristic velocity of the emission line region is given by the fwhm of the rms profile and the characteristic distance r is given by the centroid of the corresponding cross - correlation function : @xmath40 in table 7 we list our virial mass estimations of the central massive object in mkn  110 .    lccc line & fwhm(rms ) & r & m + & [ km s@xmath3 ] & [ ld ] & [ @xmath41 + ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) & ( 3 ) & ( 4 ) + heii@xmath10   & 4930 @xmath34 200 & @xmath25 & @xmath42 + hei@xmath12   & 2200 @xmath34 100 & @xmath27 & @xmath43 + h@xmath4 & 2010 @xmath34 100 & @xmath26 & @xmath44 + h@xmath9 & 1540 @xmath34 100 & @xmath29 & @xmath45 +    altogether we determine a central mass of : @xmath46    we can independently estimate an upper limit of the central mass if we interpret the observed redshift of the very broad heii component ( @xmath47 ) as gravitational redshift ( e.g.  zheng & sulentic 1990 ) : @xmath48 again we presume that this line component originates at a distance of 9 ld from the central ionizing source .",
    "we derive an upper limit of the central mass of @xmath49 this second independent method confirms the former mass estimation .",
    "mkn  110 shows strong variations in the continuum and in the line intensities on time scales of days to years .",
    "the continuum - especially the blue range - varies by a factor of 3 to 5 on time scales of years .",
    "the balmer line intensities vary by a factor of 2.5 while the heii@xmath04686 line shows exceptionally strong variations by a factor of 8 .",
    "we cross - correlated the light curves of the emission lines with those of the continuum .",
    "the emission lines originate at distances of 9 to 80 light days from the central source as a function of ionization degree .",
    "not only the line intensities but also the line profiles varied .",
    "we detected a very broad line region vblr component in the high intensity stages of the balmer and heii lines .",
    "this region exists separated from the `` normal '' broad - line region at a distance of only 9 light days from the central ionizing source .",
