    "water is a key element for life , but nevertheless its properties arising from its unique structure are not fully understood yet .",
    "a large amount of published works explored the several phases of water and many efforts have been spent by the scientific community in order to match experimental findings with theoretical predictions .    from the chemical and biological points of view , a deep understanding of the properties of acqueous systems and therefore of liquid water is fundamental .",
    "over the past years , the structural and dynamical properties of liquid water have been investigated relying on the state - of - the - art molecular dynamics techniques such as empirical force field methods @xcite and _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) .",
    "the latter methodology has been extensively employed for the study of liquid water @xcite as well as acqueous solution of biological interest @xcite ; within , this technique , the atomic force fields required as input by any molecular dynamics simulation are constructed from _ ab initio _ potential energy surfaces ( pess ) and therefore directly derived from first principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "working out an accurate pes for liquid water has been a longstanding challenge in the scientific community ; this is due mainly to the absence of an _ ab initio _ method able to develop a reliable pes that describes breaking and formation of hydrogen bonds ; other issues are related to difficulties in simulating weak interaction and polarization effects in the network of polar molecules .",
    "the simulation of liquid systems requires model clusters with a large amount of molecules and therefore a good scalability is fundamental in order to carry out simulations in a reasonable computational time ; therefore the technique which has been mostly employed over the past years is density functional theory ( dft ) which combines scalability and flexibility features .",
    "nevertheless , molecular dynamics simulations which start from dft - based pes fail in reproducing basic properties of liquid water such as the melting point temperature @xcite and the oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "another major problem which has not been elucidated yet by aimd is the description of proton transfer ( pt ) in liquid water , phenomenon which goes under the name of grotthuss mechanism @xcite .",
    "this process is extremely important in a wide range of biological systems and it influences many dynamical processes in material science , biochemistry and bioenergetics ; for example , pt is one of the main mechanism for charge transport through the cell membranes @xcite ; it plays an important role in several enzymathic reactions and photosynthesis @xcite and moreover proton has the role of mediator and promoter of many acid - base reactions in solution @xcite .",
    "although over the past years many experimental and theoretical works have been devoted to the study of grotthuss reaction , an accurate quantitative explanation of the underlined mechanism is not fully reached yet .",
    "theoretical investigations still fail in pt basic properties predictions , such as the activation barrier .",
    "experimental measures of this quantity have been carried out @xcite and followed by many attempts of its numerical estimation @xcite , without a satisfactory accordance .",
    "nevertheless , over the past years aimd simulations have given many insights on the physics of grotthuss mechanism @xcite .",
    "it has been found that proton transport is abnormally high and it is not driven by any ordinary diffusion process .",
    "the picture which is instead commonly accepted describes the translocation of excess positive charge along the hydrogen - bonded network as structural diffusion of the defects .",
    "has very recently shed new lights on proton transfer and has highlighted the complex nature of the process which involves both structural and dynamical changings of the hydrogen - bonded network .",
    "one of the main issues which sets back from a complete understanding of pt in water , is related to the very sensitive thermal behavior of pt .",
    "the required pes precision of the order of few tenths of kcal / mol has been reached only recently by the state - of - the - art computational methods beyond dft , such as coupled cluster ( cc ) , multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) and the full configuration interaction quantum monte carlo ( fciqmc ) methods ; on the other hand , they are characterized by a much poorer scalability with respect to dft and therefore they do not allow simulation of sufficiently large molecular clusters .    over the past years , two main structural models has been proposed to explain proton hydration : m. eigen @xcite considered as core of pt the complex @xmath5 in which an hydronium @xmath6 is strongly bounded to three water molecules ; g. zundel @xcite proposed a different reaction which involves the simpler @xmath0 complex ( the `` zundel ion '' or `` protonated water dimer '' ) as core of the transfer of proton between two h@xmath7omolecules .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that these two models occur only as limiting or ideal structures for a more complex phenomenon which involves a large portion of the hydrogen - bonded network .",
    "nevertheless they constitute a perfect testing ground for the most advanced simulation techniques .",
    "in particular , the protonated water dimer @xmath0 is the smallest system in which an excess proton is shared between water molecules ; due to its simplicity , many studies have been carried out to elucidate its properties .",
    "over the past years , several accurate theoretical works have appeared on the zundel ion to study its structure and energetics@xcite ; the fast development of spectroscopical instruments allowed to probe experimentally vibrational properties of ionic species and therefore many studies on this side have been published @xcite on @xmath0.also molecular dynamics simulations which include quantum effects via feynman path integrals have been performed ( see ref .   as a relevant example ) and recently an accurate pes has been produced @xcite with state - of - the - art coupled cluster technique including single , double and perturbative triple excitations ( ccsd(t ) ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we report on an extensive study of the protonated water dimer using a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) approach based on a highly correlated variational wave function for energy and geometry calculations .",
    "this approach has a very good scalability with the number of particles with respect to other post - dft methods .",
    "we demonstrate that it also insures the precision of a few tenths of kcal / mol required for an accurate study of the system .",
    "these appealing targets are achieved by our jastrow correlated antisymmetrized geminal power wave function ( jagp ) , developed on an efficient contracted single particle basis set . while the jagp provides the necessary ingredients to treat both dynamical and static correlations , the contracted basis set , based on atomic hybrid orbitals , reduces dramatically the computational cost to optimize the jagp wave function .",

    "this method allows a very small force convergence threshold of @xmath12 h@xmath13 on each atomic component at the end of the relaxation .",
    "the potential energy surface of the dimer is very flat @xcite and it develops on energy differences of less than 1 kcal / mol .",
    "therefore such an accuracy on atomic forces is essential for the minimization to provide a reliable dft description of the system .",
    "we perform gaussian dft calculations with both pseudopotentials and full electron - ion potentials .",

    "these singularities represent a serious issue when an approximated wave function ansatz is employed to solve the schrdinger equation of a quantum system .    within a dft framework ,",
    "the divergence created by electron - electron coalescence is intrinsically solved by the mean - field description of the system , which maps the interacting hamiltonian onto a one with independent electrons .",

    "we are able to perform calculations considering the bare interaction for both oxygen and hydrogen atoms ( full potential calculations ) . furthermore , at variance with conventional dft calculations based on gaussian localized orbitals , in our approach all the overlap matrix elements involved are computed as numerical integrals over a uniform mesh .",
    "such integrals , due to the presence of the jastrow factor , converge very rapidly with the number of points in the mesh and thus can be evaluated with a reasonable computational effort.@xcite    with the aim at reducing the computational cost , calculations are carried out also by replacing the 1s core electrons of oxygen with the pseudopotential approximation , while the hydrogen atoms are treated always with the full coulomb potential .",

    "indipendently of the technique , qmc provides an intrinsic scaling of @xmath54-@xmath3 , with @xmath38 the number of electrons , whereas state - of - the - art coupled cluster single and double ( ccsd ) is @xmath55 and coupled cluster single , double and triple ( ccsd(t ) ) methods are @xmath56 . therefore qmc approaches allow the treatment of larger molecular clusters with respect to other highly - correlated methods .",

    "qmc total energy calculations are in general much more efficient than those of other observables , due to the _ zero - variance _ property of the energy estimator . generally speaking ,",
    "estimators of other important observables , as the charge density , do not possess this property .",
    "some other bare estimators , as the one for the atomic forces , could have infinite variance .",
    "thus they affect the overall computational efficiency of the qmc calculation .",
    "in particular , over the recent years a major improvement has been achieved in the development of an efficient estimator for nuclear forces@xcite .    in the present work , we use a version of this estimator based on the space - warp coordinate transformation@xcite and implemented with an exact infinitesimal differentiation method@xcite .",
    "this allows a single sample calculation of the ionic forces with a computational effort of the order of @xmath2 ; this scaling is comparable to the one for total energy .",
    "moreover , the infinite variance of the space - warped force estimator in the proximity of the nodal surface of the wave function is solved as explained in refs .  .",

    "[ static_barrier ] shows that qmc and ccsd(t ) display a vanishing energy barrier of the order of @xmath99 kcal / mol as the hydrogen is displaced along the oxygen - oxygen axis .",
    "the height of this barrier is slightly above the attained statistical error in our typical qmc run .",
    "however , despite the very sensitive behavior of the dimer pes around the symmetry - breaking point , the accuracy of our force minimization algorithm allows to account for the tiny energy differences involved ; thus it ensures the necessary precision to describe the pt physics in the dimer .",
    "as we discuss in the next section , a similar accuracy can be achieved in larger molecular clusters with a reasonable amount of computational time .",
    "therefore our qmc framework guarantees a reliable description of the pt physics also for more realistic models .",
    ".static proton transfer barriers ( kcal / mol ) at fixed @xmath8 separations .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the other results are obtained at larger oxygens separations , further from the symmetry - breaking point . they confirm the general behavior already seen along the @xmath8 rc .",
    "lrdmc and cc results are in a good agreement up to @xmath137 kcal / mol , whereas the vmc slightly overestimates the barrier . as well known from previous works , dft substantially underestimates the barrier with respect to post - dft methods which provide a better treatment of correlations .    finally , let us analyze the extreme limit of the asymmetric zundel configuration , namely when @xmath138 , with the formation of one h@xmath7o  and one hydronium .",
    "the dissociation energy @xmath139 of @xmath0 is computed by setting the distance between the two oxygens to @xmath140  . with the ccsd(t ) pes , we checked that this is already in the large distance plateau .",
    "we get a @xmath139 of @xmath141 kcal / mol by vmc , and @xmath142 kcal / mol by lrdmc , to be compared with the ccsd(t ) value of @xmath143 kcal / mol from ref .  , while the pbe - dft gives @xmath144 kcal / mol .",
    "the agreement between the lrdmc and ccsd(t ) is impressive , while it is already good for the vmc estimate.this is mainly due to the size consistency of the jagp ansatz , obtained once the jastrow is close to the complete basis set limit .",

[ blowup_landscape ] with respect to lrdmc values .       & & + 1 & 0.05 & 0.15 + 2 & 0.24 & 2.13 + 6 & 6.49 & 164.35 +    qmc methods present a favorable scalability with the number of particles with respect to other highly correlated approaches such as cc . with the aim at proving this feature also for our approach",

    "[ comp_time ] we report a comparison of the computational time required to carry out typical vmc and lrdmc runs for different sizes of the protonated water cluster at fixed optimized variational parameters and geometry .",
    "the calculations have been carried out on the hpc curie thin nodes ( 2.7 ghz 8 core intel sandy bridge processors ) , and performed with a target statistical error of @xmath145 kcal / mol in the total energy . by performing a simple fit on the data in table  [ comp_time ]",
    ", we notice that the simple vmc displays a @xmath54 scaling with the number of particles ; the more accurate lrdmc , carried out at a lattice space of @xmath146 , shows instead an almost perfect @xmath3 scaling .",
    "however , the lrdmc calculations are still feasible in a reasonable computational time for the 6 h@xmath7o  cluster , while the vmc is still cheap at that cluster size .",
    "in this paper we presented an extensive study of the protonated water dimer by means of the vmc and lrdmc techniques .",
    "the jagp ansatz employed in this work implements an accurate treatment of both static and dynamical correlations among electrons .",
    "the expansion of the determinantal part over atomic hybrid orbitals ensures a drastic reduction of the number of variational parameters thus making the wave function optimization procedure efficient and robust even for large systems . the comparison with previous published qmc calculations on the single water molecule showed the quality of our wave function ansatz .",
    "total energy calculations are performed with the less expensive variational monte carlo approach along with the more precise projective diffusion monte carlo .",
    "the powerful minimization algorithm implemented in our qmc software , allows an efficient estimation of the forces acting on each atomic component with a reasonable computational cost .",
    "hence both energetics and geometry calculations are perfomed within the qmc framework .",
    "a simple mechanism of proton transfer in the dimer has been presented and exploited to choose a suitable reaction coordinate for the potential energy curve .",
    "the energy landscape as a function of the oxygen - oxygen distance is computed and compared with density functional theory in the pbe approximation and with ccsd(t ) results ; lrdmc is in excellent agreement with ccsd(t ) calculations ( within @xmath137 kcal / mol ) , whereas minor differences ( up to about @xmath147 kcal / mol ) are shown by vmc .",
    "ref .   has recently reported a similar accuracy for small water clusters by diffusion monte carlo calculations .",
    "geometrical properties of the excess proton are also investigated by vmc structural relaxations , which provide geometries remarkably close to the ones obtained by a ccsd(t ) fitted pes .",
    "we show the presence of two distinct regimes of the dimer depending on the oxygen - oxygen distance : one with a centrosymmetric excess proton and the other with the proton localized on one of the water molecules .",
    "the stability of these configurations crucially depends on the level of theory employed to describe the electronic structure of the system . a better treatment of electron correlation results in the stability of the asymmetric proton geometry over a wider range of @xmath8 distances .",
    "these results , together with the proton transfer static barrier and the dissociation energy @xmath139 , show that our qmc approach has a global accuracy comparable with the state - of - the art coupled cluster in both geometry and energetics of the dimer , with the advantage of having a better scaling with the number of particles .",
    "the accuracy shown by our qmc calculations combines with a favorable scalability with the number of particles with the respect to other highly correlated techniques , as demonstrated with a test simulation on a larger protonated water cluster .",
    "these features make this approach a very promising candidate for the study of proton transfer in complex acqueous systems .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the vmc method is cheap , provides very accurate geometries and a global accuracy of less than 1 kcal / mol in the most important region for the pt physics .",
    "we hope that our work will inspire further studies on this direction , and pave the way for accurate highly - correlated simulations of more realistic proton transfer models which will eventually shed new insights onto the pt mechanism in water .",
