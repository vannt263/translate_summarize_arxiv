    "the study of complex networks , representing interactions among components , has become a central tool in the science of complex systems @xcite .",
    "evolutionary relationships between species are usually represented in phylogenies , i.e. evolutionary trees .",
    "one branching event represents the evolution of an ancestral species into descendent ones .",
    "the whole set of relationships among all known species is conceptually represented as a huge _ tree of life_. a tree is a network in which there are no cycles , i.e. , there is a unique path from one node to another inside the network .",
    "this is probably a good approximation to the correct large scale structure of the tree of life , but processes such as lateral gene transfer or hybridization would need a richer network structure to be properly represented @xcite .",
    "if analyzing the tree of life at a finer detail , entering the scale appropriate for ecological interactions , we observe that species are composed of different populations , and that those are made of individuals that interchange genes and recombine their genomes in processes such as sexual reproduction .",
    "thus , there are gene flow processes , particularly obvious when looking at the intraspecific level , which add loops to the tree of life , and make the whole structure a rather complex object .    in this paper",
    "we briefly analyze , at three different scales , some properties of this complex network of evolutionary and ecological gene flow .",
    "our aim is just to provide an overview of the many interesting features of genetic relationships and phylogenies that can be addressed from the point of view of complex systems , with the hope that this will stimulate further and more detailed work .",
    "first , we characterize large scale evolutionary relationships , the ones more traditionally represented in a tree topology . to this end",
    "we analyze a large scale reconstruction of the tree of life and characterize it by its degree distribution .",
    "second , we represent the genetic relationships between individual shoots of a mediterranean marine plant , posidonia oceanica , sampled across its entire geographical extent , in terms of a minimum spanning tree that would represent the most parsimonious pattern of gene flow between distant populations .",
    "finally , relationships among shoots in the same population are represented as networks of genetic similarity .",
    "since the beginning of the studies on evolutionary biology , one of the most ambitious goals has been the assemble and comprehension of the complete evolutionary history of biodiversity .",
    "this assembly has produced a huge phylogenetic tree , baptized with the name  tree of life \" .",
    "the data set analyzed here is the reconstruction of the tree of life which is available at the database of the _ tree of life web project _ ( http://www.tolweb.org/ ) .",
    "it contains about @xmath0 nodes . a very small portion of it , showing the first ramifications ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tree of life ] .",
    "one of the first quantities to discuss when analyzing complex networks is the degree distribution , @xmath1 , i.e. the proportion of nodes in the network which are connected to @xmath2 neighbors . for our tree , this function is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : degree distribution ] ( together with the function @xmath3 , giving an accumulated version of the distribution ) .",
    "we see that the probability of finding a node with degree @xmath2 decays as a power law @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    "thus , this phylogenetic tree has a broad degree distribution of the scale - free type .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath6 characterizing this distribution is consistent with the results obtained by cartozo _",
    "@xcite from a previous taxonomic diversity analysis , where the values obtained were in the range @xmath7 .",
    "the use of the degree distribution to characterize a phylogenetic tree needs some qualification : it is generally accepted that a true phylogenetic tree at high enough resolution will contain only binary branchings @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath8 for all internal nodes , and @xmath9 for the root and the terminal tips , that would constitute about one half of the nodes .",
    "the presence of nodes with a very high degree ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : degree distribution ] ) in our data set reveals a large amount of polytomies .",
    "this would correspond to successive branchings of several species or groups in an order that can not be resolved with the techniques used in the phylogenetic reconstruction , so that all of them are assigned the same branching point . in this sense",
    ", it can be thought that a characteristic such as the degree distribution is quantifying more the limitations of the methodology used to reconstruct the phylogenetic history than the true evolutionary branching itself",
    ". the limitation would be clearer if considering the statistics of taxonomic classifications , in which branchings are forced to fit into the restricted set of levels established by taxonomic science ( domain , kingdom , phyllum , class , order , family , genera , specie ) .",
    "the _ tree of life web project _ used here does not use a strict taxonomic classification , since new levels are added as needed .",
    "it is likely that the broad distribution of degrees obtained here reflects a property of _ radiation _ processes during evolutionary history , i.e. events in which many new species appeared during a relatively short period of time @xcite .",
    "clearly , further analysis is needed to establish which features of the degree distribution arise from phenomena of biological relevance and which are consequences of the lack of resolution of available reconstruction methods . in any case , it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : degree distribution ] that the proportion of nodes with @xmath8 , representing binary branchings , stands up above the background power law behavior .",
    "we see also the presence of some nodes with @xmath10 ( they represent taxa which consist of only one subtaxon ) , although in a very small proportion .",
    "we now consider in more detail the genetic structures present at one of the tips of the above tree of life .",
    "we focus in a particular species and analyze its internal genetic relationships , first across its whole geographical range , and then at particular locations .",
    "we consider the case of posidonia oceanica , a marine angiosperm living in meadows submerged between 0 to 40 m in the mediterranean sea @xcite .",
    "it combines clonal reproduction with episodes of sexual reproduction .",
    "this plant is experiencing basin - wide decline and is subject to specific protection and conservation measures @xcite .",
    "genomic dna data are available from approximately 40 shoots sampled in each of 37 localities across the mediterranean .",
    "a set of seven microsatellite markers was used to characterize the genotype of each individual .",
    "this provides us with a data set @xcite consisting on the number of repetitions of the microsatellite motif at each locus of each shoot sampled . in this set",
    ", a convenient genetic distance @xmath11 can be defined @xcite which measures the degree of dissimilarity among every pair @xmath12 of sampled shoots . from this distance matrix , several trees and networks can be built and analyzed , as described in the following .",
    "we can consider the fully connected network linking all pairs of shoots in our data set . given a connected , undirected graph ,",
    "a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph which is a tree , i.e. contains no loops , and connects all the vertices together .",
    "a single graph can have many different spanning trees .",
    "our distance matrix @xmath11 assigns a weight to each of the links .",
    "we can use this information to assign a total _",
    "length _ to each of the possible spanning trees by computing the sum of the distances of the edges which are kept in that spanning tree . a minimum spanning tree ( mst ) is then a spanning tree with the minimum possible total length . in the case",
    "in which all edges have a different distance , the mst is unique . but more generally , there could be several msts for a particular network and distance matrix .",
    "a mst is in fact the minimum - cost subgraph connecting all vertices , since subgraphs containing cycles necessarily have more total weight .",
    "this allows to interpret the mst as the main path of gene flow among the plant populations , as it links all the specimens in the genetically shorter way .",
    "[ fig : mst ] shows the mst associated to the set of shoots and the corresponding distances ( it is in fact one of the several equivalent mst with identical total length and similar shape that can be constructed from our distance matrix ) .",
    "the nodes , representing shoots , are colored with the same shade if they have been collected from the same meadow .",
    "the upper part of the tree contains shoots from populations in the eastern and central mediterranean , and the lower part from the northern spanish coast , in the western mediterranean .",
    "the central part of the mst is occupied by populations in the balearic islands .",
    "the tightly packed balls of nodes group together genetically identical shoots , arising from clonal reproduction . although most of the shoots from the same location appear close together in the tree , there is some scatter , indicating that there has been some migration between different populations .",
    "this would need to be represented with additional links introducing cycles and transforming the tree into a more complex network .",
    "figure [ fig : degreemst ] shows the cumulative degree distribution characterizing the mst .",
    "it follows a power law with exponent -1.95 , so that the degree distribution is of the scale - free type , satisfying @xmath13 .          still at a smaller scale",
    ", we can address the genetic relationship among shoots sampled inside the same meadow .",
    "it is clear that a tree structure is not appropriate to represent the intense gene mixing that would be provided by sexual reproduction at this scale .",
    "starting from the fully connected network containing links among all pairs of shoots , we can discard the links containing higher distances and retain only those that represent a sufficiently close genetic similarity .",
    "this is related to the network construction methods based in correlation thresholds @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we constructed networks of genetic similarity among _ genets _ ( the set of clonally identical shoots ) by choosing as the distance threshold the so called _ outcrossing distance_. this is the average distance between the genets in a population and its offspring obtained from a simulation of outcrossing , i.e. sexual reproduction among genetically different individuals .",
    "the same idea is applied here to obtain networks of shoots .",
    "network links will join shoots which are genetically closer than the typical outcrossing distance for their population .",
    "figure [ fig : espujolscampomanes ] shows two examples of networks obtained in such a way .",
    "the network representation visually highlights the main features of the population structure .",
    "for example the population in es pujols ( fig .",
    "[ fig : espujolscampomanes]a ) consists of a central core of interconnected shoots to which less central organisms are linked",
    ". campomanes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : espujolscampomanes]b ) , instead , is structured in two main components .",
    "the size of these networks is too small to search for scaling properties in the degree distribution , but the analysis in @xcite at the genet level reveals that they have the characteristics of small worlds @xcite , i.e. clustering significatively higher than a random network with the same number of nodes and links , while at the same time keeping the same low diameter values characteristic of random networks .",
    "we have presented a brief overview of properties of trees and networks constructed in the context of phylogenetic and genetic relationship at very different scales , from evolutionary to ecological .",
    "the visual inspection of these structures reveals interesting clues such as paths of gene flow , patterns of speciation , or population structure . the open challenge is to relate more quantitative topological properties of these complex networks to relevant biological mechanisms .",
