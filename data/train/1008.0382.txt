    "can straightforwardly relate the parameter @xmath78 with the brans  dicke constant : choosing the radial flare - out condition it is necessary ( but not sufficient ) that @xmath112 and @xmath113 in order to satisfy the energy conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "if the areal flare - out condition is adopted the energy conditions require that @xmath114 and @xmath113 .",
    "given the number of parameters involved in the analysis and the range of values that they can take , a natural approach is to draw the intersection of conditions ( [ for ] ) , ( [ s+pr ] ) and ( [ s+pf ] ) and of the conditions ( [ foa ] ) , ( [ s+pr ] ) and ( [ s+pf ] ) . the results are shown for the radial flare - out condition in fig . 2 , and for the areal flare - out condition in fig .",
    "3 , choosing different values of the parameters and of the brans  dicke constant . by comparing these figures with fig .",
    "1 , they reveal that in the case of the regular constructions ( @xmath102 ) , the existence of a throat requires the presence of exotic matter . instead , for manifolds with a singularity at a finite radius ( @xmath100 ) , the existence of a throat is compatible with a layer of matter satisfying the energy conditions .",
    "this happens with any of both definitions of the flare - out condition and for both normal and ghost scalar fields .",
    "the regions where the energy conditions are fulfilled turn out to be larger in the case of the areal definition ; the reason can be found in the fact that the areal condition reflects the fast increase in the function @xmath15 with the radius @xmath51 corresponding to @xmath113 and negative values of @xmath6 .",
    "we have constructed static cylindrical thin - shell wormholes within the brans  dicke theory of gravity .",
    "two possible definitions of the flare - out condition areal and radial were considered , and the character of matter in the shell placed at the throat has been studied .",
    "examples of wormholes obtained by the cut and paste procedure from the general cylindrical static vacuum solution and from the metrics corresponding to magnetic and electric axisymmetric fields have been examined in detail . in the vacuum and in the magnetic cases",
    "the wormhole construction can be performed , but with exotic matter in the shell for all values of the parameters . in the case",
    "associated with a radial electric field , the metric adopted in the construction has a singularity at a finite radius .",
    "wormholes with regular asymptotics can be constructed , but they must be threaded by exotic matter .",
    "configurations with a throat without exotic matter are possible for certain values of the parameters and of the brans  dicke constant , but they present a singular surface at a finite radius .",
    "this result is obtained for both definitions of the flare - out condition and both normal or ghost brans  dicke fields .",
    "the global properties in this case are rather unusual : the geometry opens up at the throat but ends at a singular surface of finite radius ( some authors would not call them true wormholes @xcite ) .",
    "the non exotic layers supporting these geometries turn out to be possible even for a non ghost scalar field . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that wormholes supported by non exotic matter require the presence of ghost fields in scalar - tensor theories of gravity ; however , these works deal with wormholes which have compact throats and extend to infinity .",
    "we understand that our results regarding throats supported by ordinary matter are a consequence of the non compact character of the configurations considered , and of the ill behavior of the geometry , which has a singularity at a finite radius .",
