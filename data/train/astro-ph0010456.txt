    "many models predict that the outflows from young protostars are magnetically collimated ( e.g. uchida & shibata 1985 ; pudritz 1986 ; shu et al . 1994 ; fiege & henricksen 1996 ) .",
    "the collimation may take place within a few stellar radii , or be maintained at much larger distances , for example by alignment of the magnetic field with streamlines in the extended protostellar envelope .",
    "these theories have previously been very difficult to test , as the outflow emission is weak compared to that of the ambient cloud .",
    "detection of the zeeman effect in molecular lines is thus very difficult , and the more sensitive technique of mapping of polarized thermal dust emission ( e.g. hildebrand et al .",
    "1996 ) can not be used , as there is no velocity information to separate the envelope and outflow .",
    "this problem can now be addressed with spectropolarimetry in the millimetre - wave regime , a recently developed technique ( e.g. greaves et al . 1999 ) utilising the goldreich - kylafis effect . in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "zeeman splitting of the rotational levels of molecules occurs , and rotational transitions can then be polarized , due to imbalances in the magnetic sublevel populations ( goldreich & kylafis 1981 ) .",
    "the percentage polarization is sensitive to optical depth and excitation conditions , since both polarizations saturate if @xmath1 , and the sub - level populations equalise if collisional transition rates significantly exceed radiative rates .",
    "however , with suitably chosen molecular lines , spectropolarimetry can be used to map magnetic fields _ as a function of velocity_. there is an ambiguity in the field direction , since the polarization direction may be either parallel or perpendicular to the net field in the plane of the sky , but this can be resolved for simple velocity structures ( kylafis 1983 ) .",
    "detections of magnetic fields using this technique have previously been published by glenn et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the envelope of the evolved star irc+10216 , and by greaves et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for two molecular clouds and the ` 2 pc ring ' around the galactic centre .",
    "these are all bright sources and the deepest observations so far are those of girart , crutcher & rao ( 1999 ) , who used the bima array to map the environment of the ngc1333-iras4a protostellar system .",
    "surprisingly , they did not find a field clearly aligned with the outflow axis , but did detect strong polarization ( 210% ) in a region within the flow where the magnetic field appears to be deflecting the gas .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we present results of a similar experiment for the molecular outflow from the vicinity of the massive young source ngc2024-fir5 .",
    "this outflow has been extensively mapped ( e.g. richer et al .",
    "1992 ) and extends several arcmin to the south , but has apparently no northern lobe .",
    "we have used the james clerk maxwell telescope to search for polarized co j=21 rotational emission ( at 1.3 mm wavelength ) in the bright , highly collimated , red - shifted lobe .",
    "polarization was detected at a low level ( @xmath2 1  % ) , and the results are discussed in the context of the outflow structure .",
    "the observations were made on 10 december 1996 , using the single - polarization heterodyne receiver a2 ( davies et al .",
    "1992 ) at the jcmt , located on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the backend was a digital auto - correlation spectrometer , set to a resolution of 0.156 mhz .",
    "standard observing techniques were used , with position - switching 0.5@xmath0",
    "west for sky subtraction , and three - load calibration ( ambient , sky and cold load ) .",
    "the polarimeter module , consisting of a rotating half - wave plate ( murray et al .",
    "1992 ) , was mounted externally in front of the receiver , and the wave plate was ` stepped ' at intervals of 22.5@xmath0 around a complete circle ( one waveplate cycle ) , to produce a set of 16 spectra .",
    "the half - wave plate rotates the source plane of polarization with respect to that accepted by the single - polarization receiver , and modulations in the co spectra were subsequently analysed as a function of waveplate angle .",
    "the reduction techniques were developed after the observations were completed , and are described below and in more detail by greaves et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "two positions were observed , centred on the positions shown in figure  1 .",
    "the integrated intensities in the outflow line wings , as a function of waveplate position , were fitted for the polarization parameters using a least - squares procedure ( nartallo 1995 ) , which gives the stokes parameters q and u of the polarization , in the receiver frame of reference .",
    "half - cycles were fitted , each containing 8 spectra , and points were allowed to be dropped to improve the fits , although only 8  % of the final data was removed in this way .",
    "the noise appears to be dominated by a few anomalous signals ( probably produced by calibration errors or brief sky changes ) , and removing these data decreases the reduced-@xmath3 of the fits by a factor of two .",
    "if these poorer data are left in , the final position angles change by about 1015@xmath0 .",
    "an instrumental polarization ( ip ) was then subtracted , measured using the same technique on the 1.3 mm continuum emission of saturn , which was assumed to be unpolarized .",
    "the ip was found to be @xmath4  % at a position angle of @xmath5 in az - el co - ordinates , and is thought to be dominated by the vertical weave of the jcmt ` windblind ' .",
    "the ip measurement used was calculated over the wing velocities , but is the same within the errors for the whole passband used ( approximately 300 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the ip - subtracted values were then corrected for parallactic angle and a fixed rotation due to the instrument position in the receiver cabin , and coadded to give the final results listed in table  1 .",
    "additionally , the data were reduced by the same algorithms but subtracting spectra taken 45@xmath0 apart , to produce stokes spectra q(v ) and u(v ) .",
    "the results for the brighter outflow position are shown in figure  2 , after converting to p(v),@xmath7(v ) , the polarization percentage and direction ( measured anti - clockwise from + declination ) .",
    "the two positions observed are a bright peak in the red - shifted outflow , and a more generic point 40 arcsec to the south . after 5 and 4 waveplate cycles respectively ( 2560 and 2048 seconds of integration ) , the rms noise levels are @xmath8 mk per rebinned 2 km s@xmath6 spectral channel , compared to the line wing brightness of @xmath9 5 k. the integrated intensities in the wings were approximately 60 and 30 k km s@xmath6 , in the t@xmath10 antenna temperature scale ( corrected for atmospheric opacity but not the main - beam efficiency , which was approximately 0.7 ) .",
    "the fainter position is about three times lower in integrated intensity than any of our previously published data ( greaves et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "polarization was detected at both positions , with similar levels of around 1  % ( table  1 ) .",
    "the significance level of the data is high , with detections of 3.5 and 4.8 sigma . using the statistical methods of clarke & stewart ( 1986 ) , these detections are real at the 99.9  % confidence level .",
    "no special procedures were used to enhance the signal - to - noise , although one fit was eliminated for each position , out of the ten and eight originally obtained .",
    "one of these discrepant fits was clearly associated with a change in intensity ( most likely a sky fluctuation ) , while the other was not explained but the stokes parameters were out of phase by @xmath11 compared to the final result .    to confirm that the results are real , a further short observation of the northern position",
    "was made on 13 august 2000 .",
    "polarization spectra from a single waveplate cycle indicated p,@xmath7 of @xmath12  % , @xmath13 .",
    "although conditions allowed only this short test , the result is in good agreement with the 1996 data . significantly , the observing parameters were completely different , including a new receiver , wider spectrometer setting , different planet ( uranus ) used for the instrumental polarization measurement , and a parallactic angle higher by 100@xmath0 .",
    "a further ` null ' test for instrument systematics is to observe a source where little polarization is expected , for example a very optically thick line .",
    "this test was performed in july 1996 , during polarimetry of the co j=32 emission towards the galactic centre ( cf .",
    "greaves et al .",
    "1999 ) , and p @xmath14  % was measured in a very bright position in the south of the ` 2 pc ring ' .",
    "this confirms that polarization is not always detected and strengthens the case for low instrumental residuals .",
    "the polarization position angles are 6@xmath0 and + 21@xmath0 , and are well aligned with the outflow axis .",
    "we estimate the flow orientation to be 5@xmath0 east of north on large scales , although the angle may be higher nearer to the origin , presumed to be fir5 ( marked in the figure by a square symbol ) or a fainter source nearby ( chernin 1996 ) .",
    "thus the polarization is within about 10@xmath0 and 15@xmath0 of the flow axis at the north and south points , respectively .",
    "there may be a slight bending of the polarization coinciding with local fluctuations in flow direction ( figure  1 ) , but this is at the limits of the errors .",
    "the percentage polarization is in very good agreement with theoretical values .",
    "deguchi & watson ( 1984 ) have modelled co polarization in sources with velocity gradients , and for the outflow optical depth and density conditions ( @xmath15(co ) @xmath9 5 , n(h@xmath16 ) @xmath9 10@xmath17 @xmath18 , richer et al . 1989 , 1992 ) , they predict p values up to about 1.0 % , depending on viewing angle ( their figures 2 and 5 ) .",
    "the observed values are at this level , consistent with the calculations if the outflow is close to the plane of the sky , as seems likely from the large extent and high apparant collimation .",
    "the polarized spectra for the north position are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the errors for single spectral channels are considerable ( averaging @xmath19  % over 2  km  s@xmath6 ) , and thus only broad conclusions can be drawn , but the percentage and direction in the red wing appear to be approximately constant .",
    "the mean values are 1.0  % and 9@xmath0 , in good agreement with the results from the fits ( table  1 ) , confirming that the two analysis methods agree .",
    "the polarization spectra for the south position are considerably noisier per channel , as the wing intensity is a factor of two less , and these spectra are not shown .",
    "the observed polarization direction is a direct diagnostic of the orientation of the magnetic field in the plane of the sky .",
    "kylafis ( 1983 ) has shown that the polarization will be either perpendicular or parallel to the field direction , even for quite low field strengths ( b @xmath9 1 @xmath20 g ) .",
    "further , if the outflow is assumed to have a one - dimensional velocity field , it is possible to distinguish between these two orientations . for large @xmath15(co )",
    ", the polarization will generally be seen parallel to the field , unless the field is at a large angle to the velocity gradient ( kylafis 1983 ) .",
    "the criterion for the field and polarization to be parallel is cos@xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , where @xmath23 is the angle between the velocity gradient and the field .    for ngc2024 , richer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have found that the flow is accelerated , with the fastest moving material further from the star , so we assume that the dominant velocity gradient is along the outflow axis .",
    "then the most probable interpretation of the data is that the magnetic field lies close to the flow axis , i.e. @xmath24 , and the polarization will be produced near the flow axis , as observed .",
    "it is unlikely that the p vectors are perpendicular to the field , as then the field would lie across the flow axis ( @xmath25 ) , and this would impede the flow by channeling ionized molecules sideways .    magnetic channeling of the outflow is not implausible on energy grounds . for a gas cylinder ,",
    "the magnetic energy is given by @xmath26 for a unit length ( e.g. chandrasekhar & fermi 1953 ) , and the outflow kinetic energy will be @xmath27 . adopting an outflow radius ( cf .",
    "figure  1 ) of @xmath28  pc or @xmath29  cm , the mass per unit length is @xmath30 g , and a lower limit on the bulk outflow speed is @xmath31  km s@xmath6 ( cf .",
    "figure  2 ) .",
    "this gives a required magnetic field strength , for the two energies to be equivalent , of @xmath32 .",
    "however , since the magnetic field affects only _ orthogonal _ flow , then the energy required is reduced when the field and flow are nearly aligned . adopting an outflow opening angle of @xmath33 ( cf .",
    "4 of richer et al .",
    "1992 ) , the cross - wise velocity is only 12  km  s@xmath6 and b @xmath34 should provide sufficient energy to keep the flow well collimated .",
    "this is not excessive , given that crutcher et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have measured a lower limit to the line - of - sight field component of 80 @xmath35 , in the main cloud emission near our north point .    in summary , the spectropolarimetry observations have shown that the outflow gas is in fact magnetized , and that the net field direction is aligned within a few degrees of the flow axis , as predicted in most models .",
    "if the magnetic field is channeling the outflowing gas , this process must be effective at quite large distances from the star ( 1 arcmin , or about 0.1 pc at a distance of 415 pc ) .",
    "we see little sign of ` magnetic deflections ' as in the ngc1333-iras4a outflow observed in co j=21 spectropolarimetry by girart et al ( 1999 ) , using the bima array with a @xmath36 synthesized beam .",
    "the ngc2024 outflow is relatively straight , although the small differences in our north and south polarization directions do appear to follow slight bends in the flow at the limits of the errors .",
    "we would like to thank per friberg , bill dent , sye murray and ramon nartallo for vital assistance with the polarimeter hardware and software , ramprasad rao for some very useful discussions , and an anonymous referee for helpful comments .",
