    "since electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) was proposed  @xcite , it has been extensively explored in various contexts  @xcite using three - level systems .",
    "the main feature of eit is that the absorption of of a weak probe field in a medium is reduced because of the presence of a strong control field .",
    "eit can be used to control the propagation of the weak field through the medium .",
    "it can also be used to greatly enhance the nonlinear susceptibility in the induced transparency region , and thus to generate a strong photon - photon kerr interaction .",
    "strong photon - photon kerr interactions have been studied to realize quantum logic operations such as controlled phase gates  @xcite , quantum fredkin gates  @xcite and conditional phase switches  @xcite for photon - based quantum information processing .",
    "moreover , kerr interactions can be employed to realize quantum nondemolition detection of photons  @xcite .",
    "recent studies show that superconducting quantum circuits ( sqc ) are one of the best candidates for quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , these artificial atoms  @xcite have been employed to study quantum optics and atomic physics in the microwave domain . for example , several studies  @xcite have explored population trapping and dark states in three - level sqcs .",
    "eit was also theoretically studied for probing the decoherence of a superconducting flux qubit  @xcite via a third auxiliary state .",
    "how to realize eit using sqcs has also been theoretically studied using several different setups  @xcite .",
    "experimentalists showed autler - townes splitting ( ats )  @xcite using various three - level sqcs  @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , up to now , there is no experiment on eit using sqcs .",
    "the main obstacle is that the decay rates of the three - level system and the strength of the rabi frequency corresponding to the controlling field can not satisfy the condition for realizing eit  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that eit  @xcite is mainly caused by fano interference  @xcite , while ats  @xcite is due to the driving - field - induced shift of the transition frequency .",
    "although the mechanisms of eit and ats are very different , they are not easy to discern from experimental observations , since both of them exhibit a dip in the absorption spectrum of the weak probe field . theoretically , there is a threshold value  @xcite to distinguish eit from ats .",
    "this threshold value is determined by two decay rates of the three - level system  @xcite .",
    "when the strength of the rabi frequency of the strong controlling field is smaller than this value , eit occurs , otherwise , it is ats .",
    "experimentally , the data should be analyzed by virtue of the akaike information criterion  @xcite .",
    "the transition from eit to ats has been experimentally demonstrated in coupled whispering - gallery - mode optical resonators  @xcite .    here , _ instead of three - level _ superconducting quantum circuits  @xcite , we study eit and the transition from eit to ats using _ a driven two - level _ circuit qed system  @xcite , where a superconducting qubit is coupled to a single - mode cavity field and driven by a classical field . the three - level system used to study eit is constructed by the three lowest - energy mixed polariton states , formed by the driving field and the states of the circuit qed system .",
    "the polariton states are hybridizations of microwave photon and qubit states . thus , the decays of the polariton states are determined by the decays of both the cavity field and the superconducting qubit .",
    "the eigenstates of the circuit qed system are mixed states of the cavity field and the superconducting qubit .",
    "these states can be approximately reduced to product states of the uncoupled cavity field and qubit states when the frequencies of the cavity field and the superconducting qubit are largely detuned . in this case",
    ", the qubit acquires a small frequency shift due to the microwave field and the purcell  @xcite enhanced spontaneous decay rate  @xcite is obtained .",
    "therefore , when the detuning between the cavity field and the qubit is changed from zero to a finite value , the decay rates of the eigenstates of the circuit qed system can also be changed",
    ". however , such tunable decay is not easy to be realized when the sample is fabricated .",
    "thus , we introduce a classical driving field to further mix the eigenstates of the circuit qed .",
    "we call these newly mixed states as polariton states",
    ". the weights of the photon and qubit states in polariton states can be tuned by the driving field , and thus the decay of the polariton states can be controlled .",
    "such polariton states were studied in order to implement an impedance - matched @xmath0 system  @xcite , where the two decay rates from the top energy level to the two lowest energy levels are identical . however , in our study , we need to engineer different decay rates of the three - level @xmath0 system so that the condition to realize eit and ats can be satisfied .",

    "sometimes , we can only find a peak and can not find a windows even when then eit and ats conditions are satisfied for a given frequency of the control field .",
    "this is because the driving energy structure of the chosen three - level system are changed by the driving field , when the frequency of the control field is largely out of resonance with the two addressed energy levels , the two peaks become one peak and then the transparency window disappears . to observe a dip in the absorption spectrum for both eit and ats",
