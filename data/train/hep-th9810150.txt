    "in the last few years the study of d - branes @xcite and their dynamics has revealed to be , under many respects , one of the most promising aspects of string theory to be investigated . in this contribution",
    "i will adress two different aspects regarding d - brane physics .    using the d3-brane as the fundamental tool i will first of all consider the interaction of two moving d3-branes in 10 dimensions .",
    "the fact that the d3-brane is a dyon ( namely charged both electrically and magnetically with respect to the r - r 4-form ) implies that the gauge interaction of two of these objects has both a coulomb - like _ and _ a lorentz - like contribution . from string theory point of view the two",
    "are encoded respectively in the even and the odd ramond - ramond spin structures emerging after gso projection on the relevant cylinder amplitude .",
    "the treatment of the odd spin structure is delicate : a naive computation would give back always a vanishing result because of the presence of at least two fermionic zero - modes coming from transverse directions .",
    "this is not peculiar of the d3-brane of course , but it is a general problem affecting the interaction of any couple of electromagnetic dual @xmath3 and @xmath4 d - branes . the first result , therefore , will be to illustrate a way to treat the non - trivial odd spin structure contribution in order to get the correct phase - shift we would expect from a field theory point of view .    in the second part of my contribution i will consider the 4 dimensional configuration corresponding to a d3-brane wrapped on the orbifold @xmath1",
    ". once integrated over the compact coordinates , this configuration corresponds to an exact black hole solution of the effective @xmath5 supergravity theory in 4 dimensions .",
    "more precisely , and this is the most interesting fact , it represents an extremal dyonic reissner - nordstrm ( r - n ) black hole with non vanishing entropy .",
    "this a particular example of what happens in generic calabi - yau ( cy ) compactifications ( @xmath1 is an orbifold limit of a cy ) : as opposite to compactifications on tori , in cy compactifications one can get regular solutions , in 4 dimensions , even with single charged objects .",
    "the non - trivial topological structure of cy supersymmetric cycles on which the d - branes are wrapped can `` re - gularize '' the solution , as the intersection of different d - branes does on tori .",
    "the d - brane / black hole correspondence has been investigated both from a string and supergravity point of view and results are shown to agree .",
    "moreover , it can be shown how the actual values of the 4 dimensional electric and magnetic charges depend explicitly on branes orientation in the compact space .",
    "as well known , d - branes can be defined as hypersurfaces on which open strings can end and therefore the potential between two interacting d - branes is expressed by vacuum fluctuations of open strings streched between them .",
    "however , thanks to the conformal invariance of the string world sheet , one can study d - branes interactions also from closed string point of view . in this latter case",
    "the d - brane can be thought as a source of closed strings and the interaction is mediated by exchange of closed string states .",
    "a very appropriate tool in order to describe d - branes and their dynamics from a closed strings point of view is the _ boundary state formalism _ @xcite .",
    "a boundary state @xmath6 describing a d - brane can be defined as a coherent state written in terms of closed string oscillators which implement the boundary conditions ( n or d ) of strings which the brane can emit .",
    "the typical structure of a boundary state describing a d - brane is of the following form : @xmath7 |0\\rangle\\ ] ] where there are contributions both from physical and ghost oscillators and where @xmath8 encodes the zero modes part of the boundary state .",
    "the matrix @xmath9 is a diagonal matrix with @xmath10 or @xmath11 entries according to dirichelet or neumann nature of the corresponding directions , respectively .",
    "let us now consider the 10 dimensional interaction of two d3-branes moving with velocities @xmath12 and @xmath13 along @xmath14 direction , tilted by angles @xmath15 on the 3 planes @xmath16",
    "( @xmath17 ) , that will eventually become compact , and with transverse positions @xmath18 :    epsf    the parameter @xmath19 is the world sheet distance while @xmath20 is the physical impact parameter .    in the boundary state formalism",
    "the interaction is given by the correlation between two boundary states and in our case can then be written in the following way : @xmath21 describing a moving brane is obtained from the static one through a lorentz transformation with velocity @xmath0 : @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the essential kinematic is encoded in the bosonic zero - modes contribution which can be written as a product of delta functions enforcing the boundary conditions for the center of mass position operator @xmath23 , that is a fourier superposition of momentum states .",
    "hence , in momentum space , the boundary states for the two branes are : @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the boosted and rotated momenta : @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 the momenta along the only two completely transverse directions .",
    "integrating over momenta and taking into account momentum conservation which for non - vanishing @xmath30 and @xmath31 forces all the dirichlet momenta but @xmath32 to be zero , the amplitude ( [ amp ] ) reads : @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the bosonic and fermionic partition functions : @xmath35 in the above expression , only the oscillator modes of the string coordinates @xmath36 appear , since we have already integrated over the center of mass coordinate .    in order to compare string and supergravity results ,",
    "we take in ( [ amp10 ] ) the limit of large impact parameter ( @xmath37 ) . in this limit",
    "only world sheets with @xmath38 contribute and the behaviour of partition functions simplifies a lot : @xmath39 if the two branes are parallel and at rest , i.e. if @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the configuration is bps and one gets @xmath42 that expresses the well known no - force condition between two bps states . if the two branes are parallel but not at rest , i.e. if @xmath40 but @xmath43 , one gets @xmath44 that is infact the phase shift leading order contribution for moving d - branes .",
    "finally , in the more general case , the configuration is not bps and one has @xmath45 .",
    "however , for suitable angles ( @xmath46 ) the configuration can still be bps , although preserving less supersymmetry . this can be seen looking to the low velocity dependence of the partition functions ; indeed in this case @xmath47 .",
    "it seems to be no contribution from @xmath48 because of the @xmath49 always present in its expression . that @xmath49 comes from the fermionic zero - modes of the only two completely transverse directions left , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and has to be soaked up if one wants to give a meaning to the odd spin structure . in the ramond sector ,",
    "odd and even spin structures are responsible for the gauge interaction between the two branes ( the ns sector encodes the gravitational contribution ) .",
    "d3-branes are dyons and therefore , for relative velocity @xmath52 there is both , in general , an electric ( coulomb - like ) and a magnetic ( lorentz - like ) interaction .",
    "the former is encoded in the even spin structure while the latter in the odd one .",
    "this means that one would expect a non vanishing contribuiton also from the odd spin structure partition function ( and the same must hold for any couple of electromagnetic dual d - branes ) .",
    "one can naively understand this point looking to the tensorial structure of the two ( even and odd ) rr contributions . from ( [ spin ] )",
    "one sees that :    @xmath53    while @xmath54 e^{-lh}|v^2,\\theta^a_2>_{rr- } \\sim \\sinh v \\,\\prod_a \\ ,   \\sin \\theta_a \\nonumber\\ ] ] the cosine is a signal of a radial ( coulomb ) force while the sine of an orthogonal ( lorentz ) one .",
    "the simbol @xmath55 $ ] in the odd spin structure expression indicates the insertion of suitable supercurrents . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown infact that with this insertion one can reproduce in string theory the expected field theory result .",
    "namely , togheter with the primary necessity of soaking up fermionic zero - modes , one gets back , as a by - product , the right tensorial structure of the interaction with respect to the transverse non - compact directions , namely the exterior product structure that is charateristic of a lorentz force .",
    "notice that in order to get a non vanishing contribution from the odd spin structure one also needs the two 3-branes being non parallel ( i.e. @xmath56 ) .",
    "this is again quite obvious : the condition for having non zero lorentz interaction between _ extended _ objects is to have a complete non parallelism between the corresponding world - volume .",
    "this is a generalization of what happens in 4 dimensions to point - like objects where the lorentz interaction is non vanishing for non zero relative velocity , this conditon being rephrased saying that there is a tilting between the worldlines of the two particles .",
    "an essentially analogous result has been achieved in a t - dual situation , namely a d0-brane moving in the background of a d6-brane @xcite . with the insertion of suitable regulator for matter and superghost zero modes",
    "it has been found a contribuiton from the odd spin structure as a scale - independent , velocity - dependent potential @xmath57 whose _ a posteriori _ interpretation is of a lorentz - like potential . in this way",
    "the direct result is not that of a phase - shift , however the final essential conclusion does not change , namely that the odd spin structure encodes the magnetic interaction contribution in a scattering amplitude of a pair of electromagnetic dual @xmath3 and @xmath4 d - branes and is in general different from zero .",
    "let us now consider the four dimensional configuration corresponding to a d3-brane wrapped on a particular 6-dimensional compact space , the @xmath1 orbifold .",
    "what has been acheived in the last few years about the d - brane / black hole correspondence is essentially that various d - branes configurations can in general give a microscopic description of both extremal and non - extremal black holes emerging in 4 dimensions by compactification of p - branes solutions of type ii supergravity in 10 dimensions .",
    "starting from type ii theory in 10 dimensons , for toroidal compactifications one obtains an effective @xmath58 supergravity in 4 dimensions while for compactifications on more generic cy spaces one ends up with @xmath5 theory .",
    "configurations for which a microscopic description can be given correspond mainly to toroidal compactifications of `` intersecting d - branes''@xcite . in @xmath5 compactifications , from microscopic point of view ,",
    "much less has been said , the essential reason being that for curved d - branes polchinski s prescription is more difficult to be implemented .",
    "the orbifold @xmath1 is actually",
    "a limit of a cy space ( with hodge numbers @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) and so falls in this latter class .",
    "it s utility resides in the fact that it has a sufficently simple structure to be treated with usual boundary state techniques but gives , on the other hand , sufficently interesting results .",
    "indeed , what i will show is that in our case , as in many other cy compactifications , one can obtain regular black hole solutions even with less than 4 charged objects , as opposite to the toroidal case .",
    "the intuitive reason for that is that the non - trivial topological structure of cy space implies that a single d - brane can `` intersect '' with itself on a given supersymmetric cycle , therefore mimicking the actual intersection of different d - branes needed on tori in order to get regular solutions .    strictly speaking a r - n black hole",
    "is a non singular spherical solution of maxwell - einstein gravity that however can be consistently extended to be @xmath5 supersymmetric .",
    "more in general , in matter coupled @xmath5 supergravity , one can have generalized regular solutions which turn out to be r - n near the horizon , that is with an @xmath61 topology .",
    "in particular , one have the so called _",
    "double extreme _",
    "solution when the vector multiplets scalars are taken to be constant and equal to their fixed values they anyhow must get at the horizon @xcite . the hypermultiplet scalars , on the other hand , couple minimally to the gauge fields and can therefore always taken to be neutral in a given solution .",
    "when one compactifies type iia or iib supergravity on a cy manifold , the number of vector and hypermultiplets of the relevant @xmath5 theory is dictated by the two relevant hodge numbers ( @xmath62,@xmath63 ) charaterizing the c - y space . in our case , that is type iib on @xmath1 , one has @xmath49 vector multiplets and @xmath64 hypermultiplets .",
    "therefore there are not vector multiplet scalars and the solution is automatically double extreme . from a supergravity point of view",
    "the solution is therefore quite straightforward .",
    "let us now analize the configuration both from a macroscopic and a microscopic point of view .",
    "a type ii @xmath3-brane usually couples to the metric , the dilaton and the corresponding ( p+1 ) gauge potential .",
    "the peculiar property of the d3-brane is that it does not couple to the dilaton and therefore the equations of motions for the relevant field in the supergravity effective theory are simply : @xmath65 one can make a block - diagonal spherically simmetric anstz for the metric @xmath66 choosing in particular the compact components @xmath67 not to depend on the non - compact coordinates @xmath68 .",
    "notice that in general the compact components of the metric should depend on non - compact coordinates , becoming some of the scalar fields in 4 dimensions . in our case , however , we know that in the effective @xmath2 supergravity we do nt have any vector multiplet scalar and the hypers have consistently been put to 0 .    for the 5-form field strenght the anstz is again quite simple because the only supersymmetric 3-cycles the 3-brane can be wrapped on are the complete holomorphic or anti - holomorphic ones because @xmath69 : @xmath70 with these anstze the equation of motions are satisfied in 10 dimensions and integrating on the 6 compact coordinates the lagrangian one gets in 4 dimensions is of a maxweel - einstein type and the solution turns out to be an extreme r - n solution .",
    "the electric and magnetic charges has the following values : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the volumes of the 3-brane and of the full compact space respectively .",
    "the extremality conditions reads : @xmath74 , with @xmath75 the mass of the solution . by now @xmath76 is just an arbitrary parameter .",
    "what i will actually show in the following is how @xmath76 depends explicitely on the d3-brane orientation in the compact space .",
    "in particular , the compactification procedure must preserve dirac quantization conditions which , being satisfied in 10 dimensions with the minimal values of the charges ( this result being valid for any for d - brane ) , must still be valid in 4 dimensions .",
    "let us now move to the microscopic side of the computation and see what happens to the previously computed scattering amplitude ( [ amp10 ] ) once one compactifies .",
    "the first thing one has to do is to project the 10 dimensional boundary state @xmath6 on its @xmath77 invariant part in this way : @xmath78 @xmath79 is the projection operator and @xmath80 is the generator of ( @xmath81 ) rotations in each of the three planes @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the net effect is that the boundary state is similar to the previous one but with a sum on @xmath82 angles whose values depend on @xmath80 ( and hence on the particular structure of our manifold ) . in this way : @xmath83 the full computation gives back the following result for the partition functions , that is similar to ( [ spin ] ) but with sums on angles @xmath82 : @xmath84 using trivial trigonometrical properties of @xmath85 angles which are peculiar , however , just of the orbifold , one obtains a very simple result for @xmath86 and the 4 dimensional amplitude reads : @xmath87 in 4 dimensional field theory language the three terms represent respectively the exchange of vector fields , of graviton fields and of scalar fields ( to which the wrapped d3-brane therefore does not couple ) : the configuration is then of a r - n type ( no scalars excited ) as we have already seen from supergravity side .",
    "it is easy to see that there is no contribution from the twisted sector because the wrapped d3-brane has mixed boundary conditions in at least one of the three @xmath88 componing @xmath1 and this is not consistent with twisting .",
    "notice that in order to find which field the brane couples to in 4 dimensions it would have not been necessary to study any scattering amplitude but rather one point functions of supergravity fields on the disk representing the d - brane .",
    "this is precisely what has been done in @xcite and the results are the same as here .    as anticipated , it is interesting to see how the d3-brane orientation in the compact space affects the values of the electric and magnetic 4 dimensional charges and how dirac quantization condition changes from 10 to 4 dimensions . in dimensions",
    "@xmath89 dirac quantization condition ( dqc ) is : @xmath90 hence it has a @xmath91 sign in 10d and a @xmath92 sign in 4d . as it is weel known ,",
    "d - branes realize dqc with the minimal amount of charge and for any couple of @xmath3 and @xmath4 branes it is always true that @xmath93 .",
    "once one compactifies the numerical values of the charges is affected by the compact part of the bosonic zero - mode part of the boundary state .",
    "indeed the net effect of the compactification is that compact space zero - modes aquire a discrete structure . before doing any orbifold projection their whole contribution to the scattering amplitude turns out to be the following : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the volumes of the two 3-branes and where various @xmath97 are integers depending explicetly to the geometric configuration of the branes in the compact space .",
    "the 4 dimensional amplitude therefore becomes the following one : @xmath98 one can now see that dqc is still valid in 4 dimensions with an integer that depends on branes orientation in the compact space .",
    "moreover , using again trivial trigonometrical properties , one can rewrite it as a combinations of 8 different charges ( 4 electric and 4 magnetic ) whose exact values depend on suitable angles combinations . using ( [ odd ] ) and ( [ muhat ] ) :",
    "@xmath99 one can see that there are always at least 4 charges with non vanishing values , independently from different values one can choose for the various angles .    by the orbifold projection only one pair of electro - magnetic charges survives ,",
    "because only one angle combination ( @xmath100 ) is @xmath77 invariant and the final result is the following : @xmath101 still satisfying dqc .",
    "as expected , each 3-brane is a point - like 4 dimensional dyon and couples to the unique gauge field present , the graviphoton .",
    "moreover , the previously introduced parameter @xmath76 has now a precise value , being the sum of the 3 angles each brane is tilted with respect to the compact space referring directions .",
    "for parallel branes one sees that @xmath102 and the lorentz contribution cancels ( see ( [ dirac ] ) ) as expected for identical dyons in 4 dimensions .",
    "it would be interesting to carry on the orbifold compactification on the type iia side where the number of vector multiplets would be 9 rather than 0 and so there would be non - trivial vector multiplet scalars .",
    "a very interesting fact is that in this case the @xmath5 supergravity effective theory turns out to be a consistent truncation of @xmath58 supergravity and in particular the solution one obtains is the most general @xmath103 supersymmetry preserving @xmath58 black hole modulo u - duality transformations .",
    "the construction of this solution ( metric , scalar and vector fields ) is the main result of a forthcoming paper i m doing in collaboration with m. trigiante and p. fr .    of course , it would also be interesting to consider compactifications on more complicated calabi - yau spaces on which however a much more involved technique is needed in order to deal with d - branes and boundary states in an efficient way .",
