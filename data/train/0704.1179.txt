    "<S> when ultrathin metal films are subjected to multiple cycles of rapid melting and resolidification by a ns pulsed laser , spatially correlated interfacial nanostructures can result from a competition among several possible thin film self - organizing processes . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate self - organization and the ensuing length scales when co films ( @xmath0 thick ) on sio@xmath1 surfaces are repeatedly and rapidly melted by non - uniform ( interference ) laser irradiation . </S>",
    "<S> pattern evolution produces nanowires , which eventually break - up into nanoparticles exhibiting spatial order in the nearest neighbor spacing , @xmath2 . for films of thickness @xmath3 , @xmath4 while the particle radius varies as @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling behavior is consistent with pattern formation by thermocapillary flow and a rayleigh - like instability . for @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> a hydrodynamic instability of a spinodally unstable film leads to the formation of nanoparticles .    </S>",
    "<S> metal nanostructures , possessing spatial order and size uniformity are attractive for a variety of applications including : optoelectronics , plasmonics , chemical and biomedical sensing , and catalytic devices @xcite . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> there has been tremendous research emphasis on finding self - organization strategies to make strongly correlated metal and semiconductor nanostructures . in the area of thin film pattern formation , epitaxial strain driven self - organization in crystallographic systems </S>",
    "<S> has been somewhat successful @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this strategy of exploiting epitaxial strain can not be applied to materials on important amorphous surfaces , such as sio@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility for self - organization on amorphous surfaces is via dewetting instabilities , such as those observed in liquid polymer films on various inert surfaces , in which preferred length scales appear when destabilizing long range attractive intermolecular forces overcome stabilizing surface tension forces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have previously shown that multiple pulses of single beam ns laser irradiation of co films with thickness @xmath7 on sio@xmath1 surfaces demonstrate self - organization by a thin film hydrodynamic ( tfh ) instability with length scales characterized by the metal surface tension ( @xmath8 ) , the dispersion force characterized by the hamaker constant @xmath9 and film thickness @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ensuing pattern had short range spatial order ( sro ) in the nearest - neighbor ( @xmath11 ) particle spacing @xmath12 , which scaled with thickness as @xmath13 , while the particle radius varied as @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> recently we have also provided preliminary evidence that 2-beam laser interference irradiation can give rise to _ quasi-2d _ ordering of the nanoparticles with both long range order ( lro ) and sro @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however the evolution of the 2-beam pattern from the flat film to nanoparticle state was not investigated , and the mechanisms for spatial ordering were not identified . here </S>",
    "<S> we report detailed experiments of 2-beam interference irradiation of co on sio@xmath1 as a function of film thickness for @xmath15 that demonstrate that the pattern evolution and resulting length scales are consequences of different mechanisms , including the tfh instability , thermocapillary ( @xmath16 ) flow and a rayleigh - like instability , based on the timescales of these processes . </S>",
    "<S> one can access a particular mechanism via the choice of film thickness and/or thermophysical parameters such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the temperature gradient .    </S>",
    "<S> cobalt films ranging in thickness from @xmath17 were deposited by e - beam evaporation onto optically smooth sio@xmath1 surfaces in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> specific details of the experiments are published elsewhere @xcite . in brief , following deposition , the co films were irradiated in vacuum with a @xmath18 pulsed laser operating at a repetition rate of @xmath19 with a pulse time @xmath20 by single beam @xcite or 2-beam interference irradiation . in the single beam case , films were exposed to an unfocused beam at normal incidence . for the 2-beam condition , </S>",
    "<S> an interference angle of @xmath21 generated a periodic laser intensity profile whose contrast was maximized by adjusting the energy density of the off - normal beam with a @xmath22 lens positioned @xmath23 away from the sample at angle of @xmath21 . in both instances , co films were irradiated for similar times as measured by the number of laser pulses , @xmath24 , for @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> also , comparable laser energy densities were used for both types of irradiation , with the energy density , @xmath26 between @xmath27 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant morphological evolution was investigated as a function of @xmath24 and was examined and characterized using a hitachi s-4500 scanning electron microscope ( sem ) . </S>",
    "<S> it was also verified that all the films studied had minimal evaporation , as confirmed by performing energy dispersive x - ray spectrometry measurements of the co concentration after irradiation .    </S>",
    "<S> as detailed in prior studies for single beam irradiation @xcite , the film shows several distinct patterns enroute to a final robust state of nanoparticles characterized by a spatially correlated nearest neighbor ( @xmath11 ) spacing . here </S>",
    "<S> we briefly summarize the trends for the purpose of comparison with the pattern evolution under 2-beam interference irradiation . </S>",
    "<S> more detailed analysis the single beam data can be found elsewhere @xcite . at the early stages ( @xmath28 ) </S>",
    "<S> regular holes with a characteristic diameter form , followed by a cellular network of polygonal structures . eventually , the polygonal networks evolve into nanoparticles , which form predominantly at the vertices of the polygons . an important property of the evolution is that the patterns possessed a characteristic length scale at every stage . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lengthscaleplots](a ) , the scaling behavior of the spatial correlation in the final stable nanoparticle state is shown for varying initial film thicknesses . the observed trend with @xmath10 was in agreement with classical linear tfh dewetting theory @xcite in which : @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the average @xmath11 nanoparticle spacing , @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath31 is the experimentally estimated hamaker constant for the @xmath32 system , @xmath33 is the co liquid surface tension and @xmath10 is the film thickness @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , volume conservation implied that the nanoparticles will have a radius that will vary with the initial film thickness @xmath10 as:@xmath34{\\frac{24\\pi^{3}\\gamma}{f(\\theta)a}}h_{o}^{\\frac{5}{3}}\\label{eq : partradius}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 accounts for the contact angle of the nanoparticles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally observed a monomodal particle size distribution with the average radius shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lengthscaleplots](b ) and a trend consistent with the above theoretical prediction from linear tfh theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of 2-beam irradiation were qualitatively different from single beam irradiation . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : patternprogression](a - c ) , the typical pattern evolution for films with @xmath3 is shown as a function of @xmath24 . in this case , the early stages are comprised of spatially periodic film rupture at length scales comparable to the interference spacing . </S>",
    "<S> longer irradiation yielded the formation of long , cylindrical - like `` nanowires '' and continued irradiation resulted in the break - up of these nanowires into particles . </S>",
    "<S> the final particle state is characterized by a quasi-2d , comprised of the lro due to periodic laser intensity and sro resulting from the break - up of the nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> the observed differences from the two processing conditions can be explained on the basis of the various mechanisms of fluid motion operating under the two irradiation conditions . </S>",
    "<S> when irradiating the metal film with a 2-beam interference pattern , the resulting periodic laser intensity induces a transient and periodic thermal gradient along the plane of the film which creates a surface tension gradient not present in the single beam irradiation . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , @xmath16 or marangoni convection of the molten co can occur . </S>",
    "<S> to contrast the results of single beam and 2-beam irradiation , the time scales for the various mechanisms were estimated . </S>",
    "<S> the timescale for @xmath16 flow can be expressed as @xcite:@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the laser fringe spacing , @xmath38 , is the co metal viscosity , @xmath39 is the rate at which the surface tension of the co changes with temperature and @xmath40 is the maximum temperature difference between the peak and valley of the laser fringe . </S>",
    "<S> the timescale for the tfh instability can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath41 an important aspect of the above equations is that the time scale of the @xmath16 flow _ decreases _ with increasing @xmath10 while the tfh instability _ increases _ with increasing @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we determined that typical liquid lifetimes range from @xmath42 and thermal gradients range from @xmath43 @xcite . from eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : tctimescale ] and [ eq : spintimescale ] , @xmath44 for films with @xmath45 and @xmath46 for films with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that pattern formation is dominated by the @xmath16 flow for @xmath3 with the tfh flow dominating for @xmath47 , as shown in the comparative timescale plot in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : timescalesandimages ] . </S>",
    "<S> this result was confirmed experimentally as nanowire formation was observed only above @xmath48 while it was absent for films @xmath49 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : timescalesandimages](inset a ) . for film thicknesses near the cross - over point of @xmath50 , the pattern consisted of particle formation with some evidence for lateral movement of the metal ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : timescalesandimages](inset b ) ) indicating that both mechanisms are operative @xcite .    for films with @xmath3 nanowire formation under the 2-beam irradiation also permitted access to a rayleigh - like instability in which cylinders are unstable to wavelengths @xmath51 , with the fastest growing wavelength scaling as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the radius of the cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic time scale for this process can be expressed as @xcite:@xmath54 where @xmath55 is the liquid density of co @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> assuming these are partial cylinders with contact angles @xmath56and using the projected width of these regions from sem images , we estimated @xmath53 , preceding the break - up into nanoparticles , to be in the range of @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> based on these values of @xmath58 the typical magnitude for the cylinder break - up time was estimated as @xmath59 . since this time scale is comparable to or smaller than the typical liquid lifetimes , the rayleigh process is clearly accessible whenever a cylinder is formed . also , according to the rayleigh formulation , the particle radius scales linearly with both the spacing between particles and the radius of the original cylinder @xcite . through volume conservation , </S>",
    "<S> the cylinder radius varies as @xmath60 , resulting in a similar scaling relation for the size of the particle as @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lengthscaleplots](a - b ) , the particle spacing and the size both scale as @xmath62 and the ratio of particle spacing to radius is independent of film thickness . while , the ratio in the classical rayleigh break - up of a perfect cylinder is expected to be @xmath63 @xcite our measured ratio was @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> we have ruled out previously existing explanations for how this ratio can be modified @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nichols et al . @xcite </S>",
    "<S> have shown that if the break - up is dominated by solid - state surface diffusion , then the ratio is maintained , however , if the flow is generated by external volume diffusion , then the ratio grows to @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the timescale over which external volume diffusion can cause break - up has been estimated as @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the volume self - diffusion coefficient , @xmath69 is the atomic volume and @xmath70 is the correlation factor @xcite ) for cylinder with @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> this timescale is well outside the realm of the laser processing time ( for @xmath72 ) , and as such can be disregarded as a possible break - up mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we have also estimated the correction to the ratio for situations in which truncated cylinders break - up based on the work by mccallum et al . @xcite and determined that only a small change to the ratio will be introduced . while there have also been papers examining the effect of having a non - uniform contact line or an anisotropic surface , these models </S>",
    "<S> also do not yield the observed 5.6 ratio @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the thermocapillary flow and a rayleigh - like instability can drive self - organization of the film such that the liquid profiles are stationary solutions to the non - linear equations describing the pattern evolution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a nonlinear analysis along with further experiments are required to verify such a hypothesis .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> self - organization leading to spatially correlated nanostructures under ns laser irradiation of ultrathin co films on sio@xmath1 has been investigated . for films with thickness @xmath73 , non - uniform laser irradiation by 2-beam interference </S>",
    "<S> leads to pattern formation characterized by the formation of nanowires via thermocapillary flow and eventually to nanoparticles via a rayleigh - like break - up of the nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> the nanowire break - up results in an average nearest - neighbor particle spacing of @xmath4 with radius @xmath5 in contrast to the tfh instability in which @xmath74 and @xmath75 . for films with @xmath6 nanowire formation </S>",
    "<S> was absent because the tfh time scales were much shorter than the @xmath16 timescale . </S>",
    "<S> these results show that self - organization through laser - induced hydrodynamic flow can be used to make a variety of strongly correlated surface nanostructures on amorphous substrates by selecting the appropriate film thickness based upon thermophysical parameters .    </S>",
