    "the study of unusual magnetic materials has increased dramatically in the past decade , due to new phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance , half - metallic ferromagnetism , spin gaps and novel heavy fermion behavior , to name a few .",
    "the heusler ( at@xmath5x type ) and half heusler ( atx type , t = transition metal , x = metal or metalloid ) structures have produced a number of unusually interesting compounds .",
    "for example , ferromagnetic ( fm ) ptmnsb was discovered@xcite to display the largest known magneto - optic kerr effect at room temperature ( at photon energy @xmath6 = 1.75 ev ) .",
    "a number of them have been proposed as half metallic ferromagnets , and nimnsb ( with one more electron than cumnsb ) is one of the most widely accepted examples of half metallic ferromagnetism .",
    "we address here the half - heusler compound cumnsb , which has its own peculiarities . in a class of intermetallic magnets where ferromagnetism ( fm ) can occur as high at 1000 k",
    ", cumnsb develops _",
    "anti_ferromagnetism ( afm ) at the relatively low temperature , with reports of t@xmath7  =  55  k from endo,@xcite 62 k from helmholdt _ et al._,@xcite and 50 k from boeuf.@xcite a large value of the ordered mn moment @xmath8 = 3.9 - 4.0 @xmath9 has been obtained from neutron scattering measurements.@xcite this moment suggests that a `` monovalent mn '' may provide a good picture , with @xmath10 high spin configuration .",
    "the curie - weiss moment is large , reported variously as 5.4 @xmath9  [ ] , 6.3 @xmath9 [ ] and 7.2 @xmath9 , [ ] the latter two of which would be more consistent with a `` divalent mn '' @xmath11 configuration .",
    "the curie - weiss @xmath12 suggests large afm interactions between the mn moments@xcite , consistent with the afm ordering .",
    "cumnsb is metallic , but experimentally much less so than the fm compounds in its class .",
    "its drude plasma energy was reported@xcite as @xmath13 = 1.6 ev compared to 2.6 - 6  ev for the fm heusler compounds , suggesting a much smaller density of states and/or fermi velocity , and an interband absorption peak was reported at 0.8 ev.@xcite for a metal , the square @xmath14 is proportional to n(e@xmath15)@xmath16 ( often interpreted as an effective carrier density to mass ratio @xmath17 ) , and this square is a factor or 3 - 15 lower than its fm counterparts .",
    "the resistivity of cumnsb shows a fairly rapid drop below t@xmath7 , with the samples of schreiner and brando@xcite dropping from around 170 @xmath18 cm above t@xmath7 to 50 @xmath18 cm at low temperature .",
    "more recent work@xcite has lowered these numbers somewhat : 120 @xmath18 cm above t@xmath7 to 45  @xmath18  cm at low temperature .",
    "such resistivity drops at magnetic ordering transitions are common and reflect spin scattering that gets frozen out in the ordered phase . in contradiction to this inference , and quite unusual for magnetic compounds , cumnsb shows little magnetoresistance.@xcite the still large residual resistivity ( @xmath19)@xcite in the best samples suggests some intersite disorder or non - stoichiometry ( the empty site makes half heuslers susceptible to such defects ) .",
    "our work indicates this compound to be a semimetal , however , so this residual resistivity alternatively may reflect primarily a low carrier density for a metal . in both afm cumnsb and several fm half heusler compounds",
    ", it has reported that the resistivity is not t@xmath20 at low temperature,@xcite however boeuf@xcite obtains essentially a t@xmath20 behavior .",
    "possibly related to some of these features is the fact that cumnsb displays a curious stability of its magnetic order under applied magnetic fields .",
    "the nel temperature is invariant for fields up to 14 t. whereas many afms display metamagnetic transitions in a field , the induced moment at 5  k and h  =  12 t is only 0.25 @xmath9 , again reflecting its imperviousness to applied fields . in a more recent work doerr et al.@xcite",
    "have seen no changes of the antiferromagnetic characteristics up to 50  t.    the remaining evidence about the electronic state of cumnsb is from heat capacity ( c@xmath21 ) data.@xcite the linear specific heat coefficient @xmath22  =  17  mj / mol  k@xmath20 corresponds to a quasiparticle density of states n@xmath23(e@xmath15 )  =  7.2  states / ev per formula unit .",
    "the t@xmath24 coefficient of c@xmath21 was reported to be two orders of magnitude larger than the anticipated lattice contribution , which by itself would suggest it is dominated by soft magnetic fluctuations .",
    "half - heusler antimonides have recently attracted attention due to their large thermopower and other promising thermoelectric properties,@xcite but the seebeck coefficient of cumnsb has not been reported .",
    "although there has been almost no electronic structure study of cumnsb , many other heusler and half heusler compounds have been studied rather thoroughly .",
    "a recent analysis of trends in the electronic structure and magnetization of heusler compounds was been presented by galanakis , dederichs , and papanikolaou,@xcite which references much of the earlier work .",
    "a recent review concentrating on spintronics applications has been provided by palmstrom.@xcite an extensive set of calculations for many half heusler compounds has been presented by nanda and dasgupta.@xcite none of these address cu - containing compounds , however .    in this paper",
    "we lay the foundations for an understanding of the electronic properties and magnetism of cumnsb by reporting local spin density results for the electronic and magnetic structures , and the equation of state , for unpolarized , ferromagnetic , and antiferromagnetic alignment of the mn spins .",
    "the results , such as the afm ordering and the low density of states at the fermi level @xmath25 , are in reasonable agreement with experimental data , so it appears that lsda is accurate for cumnsb as it is in most other intermetallic @xmath0 compounds .",
    "the resulting band structure in the afm phase is rather unusual , being that of a compensated semimetal with normal mass hole bands but heavy mass electron bands .",
    "possible correlation effects are investigated using the correlated band theory ( lda+u ) method .",
    "the half heusler structure is based on the heusler structural class at@xmath5x of numerous intermetallic compounds , with space group fm3 m ( # 225 ) whose point group contains all 48 cubic operations .",
    "this structure type can be pictured in terms of an underlying bcc arrangement of atomic sites with lattice constant @xmath26/2 , with atom a at ( 0,0,0 ) , x at ( @xmath27 , and t at ( @xmath28 and ( @xmath29 .",
    "thus the t and x sites lie on the corner sites of the bcc lattice ( alternating ) , while the a sites comprise the body center sites . in the half heusler structure ,",
    "one of the t sites is unoccupied .",
    "the cumnsb therefore can be viewed as `` mncu@xmath5sb '' with the cu site at ( @xmath27 unoccupied .",
    "there are alternative views of the structure .",
    "for example , in at@xmath5x , the a and x sites form a rocksalt lattice and the t atoms fill the tetrahedral sites of this lattice . alternatively , in half heusler atx , a and t form a zincblende lattice and half of the interstices ( those neighboring t ) are filled with x atoms .",
    "an alternative view of last choice is the viewpoint of a zincblende lattice formed of t and x atoms , with a placed at the interstitial site nearest t. we will study whether any of this viewpoints is preferable to the others .    the half heusler structure has space group f@xmath30 ( # 216 ) with the tetrahedral point group .",
    "the crystal structure@xcite is fcc , lattice constant @xmath26 = 6.088   , with mn ( a ) at ( 0,0,0 ) , cu ( t ) at ( @xmath31 ) and sb ( x ) at ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the symmetry of all the sites is @xmath30 .",
    "it will become significant that in this structure the magnetic atom mn is coordinated tetrahedrally by four cu atoms at @xmath33  =  2.64   , with the other four nearest sites being vacant .",
    "mn is second - neighbored by six sb atoms at a distance of @xmath34=3.04   .",
    "the mn - cu distance is almost identical to the sum of their atomic radii ( 1.35    and 1.28   , respectively ) , while the mn - sb distance is 3% greater than the sum of their radii ( 1.35    and 1.59   , respectively ) .",
    "the afm structure consists of alternating ( 111 ) planes of mn atoms with aligned spins .",
    "the mn - mn nearest neighbor distance of 4.31   assures that direct mn - mn exchange is not a dominant factor in the magnetic ordering .",
    "two types of band structure methods have been used . the full - potential nonorthogonal local - orbital minimum - basis scheme (",
    "fplo)@xcite was used for scalar relativistic calculations in the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation energy@xcite .",
    "cu @xmath35 , mn @xmath35 , and sb @xmath36 states were included as valence states .",
    "all lower states were treated as core states .",
    "we included the relatively extended semicore @xmath37 states of cu and mn , and @xmath38 semicores of sb as band states because of the considerable overlap of these states on nearest neighbors .",
    "this overlap would be otherwise neglected in the fplo scheme .",
    "the spatial extension of the basis orbitals , controlled by a confining potential @xmath39 , was optimized to minimize the total energy .",
    "the self - consistent potentials were calculated on a 12@xmath4012@xmath4012 k mesh in the brillouin zone , which corresponds to 116 k points in the irreducible zone .    for the magnetic calculations the full - potential linearized augmented - plane - wave ( flapw ) method as implemented in the wien2k code@xcite was used .",
    "the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 states were treated using the apw+lo scheme @xcite , while the standard lapw expansion was used for higher @xmath44 s .",
    "the basis size was determined by @xmath45 .",
    "the space group of the afm structure is r@xmath46 ( # 160 ) .",
    "the results we present result from use of the perdew - burke - ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation form@xcite of exchange - correlation functional , but for the bands and density of states the results are similar to those from the local density approximation .",
    "the ( unstable ) paramagnetic electronic structure of cumnsb is unusual . the density of states ( dos ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ pmdos ] , exhibits a narrow peak around the fermi level e@xmath15 , with an extremely narrow valley slightly below e@xmath15 .",
    "the five @xmath0 bands that in metallic mn are spread over @xmath475 ev are here confined to a 1 ev region centered on e@xmath15 .",
    "the split peak is the result of a gap between the disjoint `` valence '' bands and `` conduction '' bands , but the gap is indirect and accidentally zero .",
    "cumnsb , with an odd number of valence electrons in the primitive cell , can not be a nonmagnetic insulator , and the occupied states include one electron in what we are referring to as the conduction bands ( those above the tiny gap ) .",
    "the upper valence and lower conduction bands show a _",
    "direct _ gap of @xmath470.1 ev around the zone edge l , w , and u points . on either side of the gap the bands are flat over most of the surface of the brillouin zone , and analysis",
    "shows that mn @xmath48 character dominates the bands on both sides of the gap ( especially above ) .",
    "the heusler and half heusler structures tend to give rise to such gaps , which is the origin of the various occurrences of half metallic ferromagnetism in this structure .",
    "one should take the point of view that cumnsb contains only one transition metal atom , since the cu @xmath49 shell is completely filled and thus inert . therefore the cu @xmath0 states are not involved in a double - peaked complex of narrow bands at e@xmath15 .",
    "ironically , we find that the presence of cu in the compound is the key to the peaked mn @xmath0 dos and possibly to the peculiarity of the magnetism .",
    "the mn atom sits at the center of a minicube in which it is coordinated tetrahedrally by four cu atoms , and also tetrahedrally by four unoccupied sites in the half heusler lattice .",
    "hence the mn @xmath0 states have only the @xmath42 states of the second neighbor sb atoms ( along the cubic axes ) and some weak cu @xmath50 character to hybridize with and hence to broaden .",
    "this coupling is weak , as reflected in the narrow mn dos . to establish the effect of cu quantitatively for states around the fermi level ,",
    "we also carried out a calculation of @xmath51@xmath52mnsb , which denotes cumnsb with the cu atom removed but leaving its @xmath50 electron ( which is simply added to the system ) .",
    "the change is very small near e@xmath15 , the one effect being that the threefold level above e@xmath15 at the zone center is shifted upward by 0.6 ev by the presence of cu .",
    "whether or not the paramagnetic phase has a stoner instability , it is clear from the huge dos peaks that a fm state with finite moment is likely to be energetically favorable to the paramagnetic state .",
    "the calculated fermi level dos is n(e@xmath15)= 11.68 states / ev per formula unit , which corresponds to a linear specific heat coefficient ( without any many body enhancement ) of 27.5 mj / mol - k@xmath20 . assuming the usual value of stoner interaction parameter @xmath53  ev leads to n(e@xmath15)@xmath54  @xmath47  9 , reflecting a very strong stoner instability ( which occurs anytime n(e@xmath15)@xmath54 @xmath55 1 ) .",
    "calculation shows that either fm or afm order lowers the energy by more than 3 ev / mn compared to a nonmagnetic configuration , reflecting the energy gain simply from local moment formation .",
    "in addition , there is an energy difference arising from the type of spin alignment . in fig .",
    "[ eos ] the equation of state is pictured for the paramagnetic , fm , and afm phases .",
    "the energy difference between fm and afm phases is about 50 mev , a factor of 60 smaller than the energy gain from moment formation .",
    "hence the mn moment will be very robust in this compound , independent of degree or type of order . also noteworthy",
    "is the large difference in volumes , the paramagnetic equilibrium being about 12% smaller in volume ( 4% smaller lattice constant ) than the magnetic phases .    before moving on to discuss the more stable afm electronic structure , we analyze briefly the fm results .",
    "the exchange splitting of the mn @xmath0 states is 3.5 ev , thus the fm bands look nothing like rigidly shifted replicas of the paramagnetic bands , as is evident from the dos pictured in fig .",
    "[ 3dos ] . for the unpolarized bands up and",
    "down bands are identical and both are about half - filled ; after spin polarization , the majority are filled and the minority are nearly empty .",
    "the large exchange splitting is characteristic of the large moment , 3.9 @xmath9 in the mn sphere , 0.1 @xmath9 from the cu sphere , and 0.4 @xmath9 in the interstitial , for a total of 4.4 @xmath9 per formula unit .",
    "the interstitial contribution is perhaps mostly from mn tails , since the mn majority states are clearly entirely filled ( fig .",
    "[ 3dos ] ) but there is some small filling of the mn minority @xmath0 states that will reduce the moment somewhat , _",
    "i.e. _ 5 ( @xmath56 ) -0.6 ( @xmath57 ) = 4.4 @xmath9 .",
    "once the moment is formed , the majority mn @xmath0 bands overlap the cu @xmath0 bands in energy and mix strongly , and together form two nearly dispersionless complexes of bands along @xmath58-a at -3.4 ev and -2.75 ev . this repulsive hybridization with the closed @xmath0 shell of cu",
    "should contribute to the large lattice expansion noted above , which is larger than that due to the conventional volume expansion due to moment formation .",
    "the minority mn @xmath0 states hybridize only with sb @xmath59 or cu @xmath50 , and form a narrow set of bands 0.8 ev above e@xmath15 that is only 0.4 ev wide ( with some tailing ) .",
    "the resulting fermi level dos is quite low , n(e@xmath15 )  =  0.505  ( up ) + 0.845  ( down ) = 1.35 states / ev per formula unit .",
    "while this fm alignment is metastable , the eos calculations show that afm alignment is more stable , in agreement with experiment . between the exchange",
    "split mn @xmath0 states lie bands with 2 - 3 ev dispersion that have primarily sb @xmath59 character .",
    "we obtain an afm state for cumnsb whose mn @xmath0 density of states is shown in fig . [",
    "the magnetic moment lies almost entirely on the mn atom , which is essentially a fully occupied majority and some minority occupation , with moment @xmath8 = 3.9 @xmath9 within the mn sphere of radius 2.2 bohr , in excellent agreement with the measured ordered moment.@xcite the mn exchange splitting is 3.5 ev , the same as for the fm case and again consistent with the large moment",
    "[ 3dos ] reflects also a very low density of states at e@xmath15 , whose value is n(e@xmath15 ) = 1.38 states / ev per formula unit . as in the paramagnetic phase ,",
    "the valence and conduction bands are disjoint , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ afmbands ] .",
    "there are two small , and one larger , fermi surface hole cylinders along the @xmath58-a @xmath60 line in this figure , which corresponds to one @xmath58-l @xmath61 direction in the original fcc zone .",
    "these holes are compensated by electron pockets at the x point of the fcc zone .",
    "it is common for the local spin density approximation to work very well for transition metal intermetallics and in compounds with pnictides , and it has been used extensively in the heusler and half - heusler classes . given the relative chemical isolation of the mn moment in cumnsb , however , one may wonder if there are residual correlations effects that should be accounted for , such as with the lda+u method.@xcite lda+u is known to do a good job of modeling the band equivalent of the mott insulator in several systems , mostly oxides .",
    "cumnsb is a metal , and in fact the calculated lsda dos seems to be at least qualitatively reasonable compared to the quasiparticle dos obtained from the linear specific heat coefficient .",
    "still , it is important to know if correlation corrections could change the results appreciably .    we have applied the lda+u functional as adapted to the linearized augmented plane wave method by shick _",
    "et al._@xcite and implemented in the wien2k code to investigate this question .",
    "the lda+u method requires the values of the mn @xmath0 coulomb repulsion @xmath62 and exchange @xmath63 constants . because we use the `` fully - localized limit '' form@xcite of functional , we make the common replacement @xmath64 , and",
    "have tried the values @xmath62 = 2.5 , 5.0 , and 7.5 ev .",
    "the resulting total and mn - projected dos are shown in fig .",
    "[ ldaudos ] .",
    "the occupied and unoccupied mn",
    "3@xmath43 states behave as expected , each moving away from the fermi level as u is increased . except for reduction of hybridization due to this shift of @xmath0 states ,",
    "the bands are changed little .",
    "in particular , the band overlap describing a compensated semimetal remains , however it is increased by 0.2 ev .",
    "the calculated values of n(e@xmath15 ) for u = 0 , 2.5 , 5.0 , and 7.5 ev are 1.38 , 0.76 , 0.66 , and 0.66 states / ev cell ( both spins ) , respectively .",
    "thus the effect of including @xmath62 is to _ reduce _ the _ band _ mass by as much as 50% , due to the reduction of the minority mn @xmath0 character in the conduction bands .",
    "the corresponding values of the mn moment ( inside the muffin - tin sphere ) are 3.87 , 4.20 , 4.40 , 4.52 @xmath9 respectively .    the band structure for u = 5 ev ( which is probably an upper limit for the value of u for mn in an intermetallic compound ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ ldaubands ] . the increased band overlap , relative to u=0 , results in larger fermi surfaces for both electrons and holes .",
    "there is a single electron ellipsoid ( at the point that would be x in the cubic brillouin zone ) , while there are three closed hole surfaces around both the @xmath58 and a points of the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "the separation ( disjointness ) between the conduction and valence bands becomes clearer when @xmath65 is included ( fig .",
    "[ ldaubands ] ) , which reflects some sort of ` bonding - antibonding ' separation that is not very clear in terms of interaction of atomic orbitals .",
    "one might then be concerned about the ` band gap problem ' in the local density approximation , for which a gap separating bands of distinctly different character is usually underestimated .",
    "one approximate remedy for this problem is the gw approximation , in which a nonlocal dynamically screened exchange interaction is included.@xcite the projected density of states however shows no clear distinction between the characters of the @xmath66 bands below and above the gap , so the self - energy correction is not likely to be large .",
    "since the band structure is that of a heavily doped self - compensated semiconductor ( whether with @xmath62 = 0 or @xmath62 = 5 ev ) , any correction will have some effect on the carrier density and on the value of n(e@xmath15 ) .",
    "in this local - density based study of the electronic and magnetic structure of the half - heusler magnet cumnsb we have found afm alignment to be energetically favored , consistent with experiment .",
    "the moments , for which the lsda value of 4 @xmath9 is in excellent agreement with the observed ordered moment , are robust independent of relative orientation .",
    "the characters of occupied states indicate that a cu@xmath1mn@xmath2sb@xmath3 configuration may be useful starting point for characterizing the electronic structure , although within lsda there is clearly some minority @xmath0 occupation .",
    "the electronic structures of all phases are representative of narrow mn @xmath0 bands in the midst of much broader bands consisting of cu @xmath50 , sb @xmath67 , and , further above , mn @xmath50 , and are consistent with earlier calculation of the density of states.@xcite    the ( lsda ) energy difference of 50 mev / mn between afm and fm alignment of spins translates , in a nearest neighbor exchange coupling model , to @xmath68=8.3 mev which with @xmath69 gives @xmath63= 1.3 mev = 15 k. such a picture of coupling is probably not of quantitative value for cumnsb , because here interactions between mn spins will be mediated by a low density of semimetal carriers , leading to coupling with several neighboring shells .",
    "there will be two distinct interactions , one through the heavy conduction electrons , another through the light valence band holes .",
    "this situation has much in common with eub@xmath70 , which a recent study@xcite has shown to have two such local - moment to itinerant - state interactions , with a different sign of the on - site kondo coupling for valence and conduction bands .",
    "the calculated lda value of n(@xmath71 ) = 1.38 states / ev per formula unit can be compared with the dressed one obtained from the linear specific heat coefficient n@xmath23(e@xmath15)= 7.2 states / ev per formula unit to obtain a dynamic thermal mass enhancement @xmath72 = @xmath73 - 1 @xmath74 4.2 .",
    "this result is indicative of a large mass enhancement due to spin fluctuations . for @xmath62",
    "= 5 ev , n(e@xmath15 ) drops to 0.66 states / ev per formula unit and thermal mass enhancement increases to @xmath72 @xmath74 10 .",
    "this nonmagnetic electronic structure is reminiscent of paramagnetic fesi , in which there is a tiny gap@xcite of 0.13 ev between flat bands that are of mostly fe character . in fesi",
    "the fe moment is very obvious in the curie - weiss susceptibility at higher temperature but becomes compensated at low temperature and the ground state is paramagnetic . in cumnsb",
    "the electron count is such that there is one electron above a similar looking gap .",
    "the other clear difference is that the mn atom remains strongly polarized in cumnsb , while the fe atom in fesi loses its magnetism at low temperature .",
    "our study of the electronic structure of cumnsb reveals that the mn @xmath0 states are virtually chemically isolated from the environment , leading to very narrow @xmath0 bands and a strong stoner instability .",
    "in the ( observed and predicted ) antiferromagnetic state , the system is semimetallic , with rather normal mass sb @xmath59 hole bands .",
    "these bands overlap a single electron band , whose character depends on whether lda is accurate or if correlations are appreciable . within lda ,",
    "the electron band contains some minority mn @xmath0 character , while this mixing rapidly disappears if u is appreciable . comparing the calculated n(e@xmath15 ) to",
    "the specific heat @xmath22 indicates a mass enhancement @xmath4 ( lda ) or as much as @xmath75 11 ( u@xmath55 5 ev ) .",
    "the observed temperature dependence of the transport coefficients show no evidence of heavy fermion behavior , however .    in the transition metal based heusler and",
    "half - heusler compounds ferromagnetism is common ; cumnsb is practically the only antiferromagnet .",
    "our calculations indeed predict that afm has the lower energy , although exploring the spin coupling mechanisms has not been the purpose of this work .",
    "the magnetic interactions presumably are mediated separately through the hole and electron bands , indeed it could be the case that the two mechanisms compete , as has been uncovered recently@xcite for eub@xmath70 .",
    "the role of the cu atom is as a spacer and donor of an electron .",
