    "the search for characteristic frequencies in astrophysical phenomena requires a careful analysis of the data with appropriate statistical tools . given the simplicity of its use and the wide availability of efficient related software , one of the most popular techniques for looking for periodicities within a time series is the periodogram technique .",

    "in fact , this tool exhibits its _ optimal _ properties only in the case of signals sampled on a regular time grid , a common situation in engineering applications but not always in astronomical experiments .",
    "the analysis of a periodogram in the case of irregular sampling is often limited by the possibility for fully fixing its statistical properties .",

    ", this would not constitute a relevant issue if ls periodogram could be used to notably improve the results obtainable by the statistical analysis of a time series . in this paper",
    "we argue that in astronomical applications often this is not the case .",

    "often the main problem is testing whether @xmath0 is due only to a noise @xmath3 , or whether some other component @xmath4 is present , i.e. @xmath5 . the most popular approach consists of computing the _ periodogram _ @xmath6 for a set of @xmath7 equispaced frequencies @xmath8 : @xmath9 with the _ discrete fourier transform _ ( dft ) of @xmath10 being @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the _ fourier frequencies_. the original time",

    "moreover , whenever @xmath19 with @xmath20 , @xmath21 is independent of @xmath22 . hence , the probability @xmath23 that at least one of the @xmath21 is expected to exceed a level @xmath24 is @xmath25^{n^*}.\\ ] ] through this quantity it is possible to fix a detection threshold @xmath24 , @xmath26,\\ ] ] corresponding to the level that one or more peaks due to the noise would exceed with a prefixed probability @xmath23 when a number @xmath27 of ( _ statistically independent _ )",

    "also in this case , it is expected that @xmath49 for small values of @xmath23 ( typically @xmath50 or @xmath51 ) .",
    "if @xmath4 is semi - periodic or even non - periodic , the situation is more complicated since more peaks are expected , but the basic idea does not change .",
    "regular sampling has many advantages , among them :    * the sine and cosine modes corresponding to the _ fourier frequencies _ constitute an orthonormal basis for signal @xmath10 .",
    "this makes operations such as noise filtering , separation and/or detection of components of interest easier ; * the spectrogram can be shown to derive from the least - squares fit of model  ( [ eq : model ] ) to the observed signal ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",

    "they constitute kinds of _ natural frequencies _ that , however , are intrinsic to the sampling characteristics and not to the signal under analysis .",
    "this implies that the frequency of interest could not belong to such a set ; * if @xmath59 contains a sinusoidal component with frequency @xmath60 ( in units of @xmath61 ) , the periodogram will show a peak in correspondence to a frequency @xmath62 .",

    "a regular sampling simplifies the analysis of the data as well as the development of efficient algorithms .",
    "however , especially in the context of exploratory data analysis , it suffers of some annoying limitations .",
    "in astronomy often the experimental conditions do not permit a regular sampling of signals and this leads to the following .",
    "first , it is no longer possible to define a set of _ natural _ frequencies ( such as the fourier frequencies ) for which to compute the periodogram .",
    "hence , there is no reason for the number @xmath7 of frequencies to be equal to the number @xmath67 of the sampling time instants @xmath68 .",

    "( [ eq : threshold ] ) , the number of frequencies @xmath7 should be substituted by the number @xmath103 of independent frequencies .",
    "the point is that @xmath104 is not known in advance and in principle , @xmath104 can be obtained from the rank of the covariance matrix @xmath95 .",
    "this last procedure can be computationally quite expensive .",
    "however , as stressed by @xcite , the dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath104 is rather weak and in many situations , @xmath105 provides a reasonable choice ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "before concluding this section , a final remark concerns the advisability of working with mean - subtracted signals .",
    "if the mean value @xmath106 of a signal is different from zero , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : aki ] ) , ( [ eq : bki ] ) imply that its contributions @xmath107 and @xmath108 to the coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 are given by @xmath109 from these equations it appears that , independently of @xmath75 , both @xmath107 and @xmath108 are different from zero . in other words ,",
    "@xmath106 influences the entire periodogram and not only in correspondence of the frequency @xmath110 as in the case of a regular sampling .",

    "obviously , all that makes more complicated the spectral analysis of the signal of interest . actually , _",
    "if the time series are not too short _ , the mean - subtraction operation does not imply particular problems .",
    "in other cases case , modifications such as the `` floating - mean periodogram '' have to be used . for a detailed discussion of such a question see @xcite .",
    "data with irregular sampling carry information that can be exploited in many ways .",
    "one of the benefits of an uneven sampling is the drastic reduction of the frequency aliasing ( i.e. the aliasing of high frequencies down to lower ones ) . in other words , it is possible to identify periodic components with frequencies much higher than the @xmath66 corresponding to that of a time series with an identical number of equispaced data spanning the same time interval .",
    "when in eq .",

    "( [ eq : ny ] ) does not hold .",
    "this implies that periodogram can be used to distinguish a sinusoid with frequency @xmath75 from another one with frequency @xmath120 also when @xmath121 .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that , if the sampling time grid is in the form @xmath122 with @xmath123 integer numbers and @xmath124 the greatest common divisor for all @xmath125 , then @xmath126 this is explained as follows : if the sampling pattern is in the form given by eq .",

    "[ fig : time1]-[fig : time2 ] show the histograms of the time instants corresponding to two sets of simulated sampling patterns ranging from regular to extremely irregular sampling .",
    "the reason for making such a choice is to verify that high values of @xmath206 are not linked to the degree of irregularity of the sampling . for the first set , the time instants have been generated starting from a grid of time instants @xmath231 regularly spaced in the interval @xmath232 $ ] and then setting @xmath233 ( { \\rm abs}[\\underline{t}_j])^{\\gamma } ( m-1)+1 \\}/2 $ ] . for the second set ,",
    "the starting regular grid is @xmath234 $ ] and @xmath235 . here ,",
    "@xmath236 $ ] is the _ sign function _ , @xmath237 $ ] indicates _ absolute value _ and @xmath238 is a positive real number . in both cases @xmath239 corresponds to an equispaced time grid . in the numerical experiment",
    "it has been assumed that @xmath240 and several values of @xmath238 have been tested",
    "[ fig : corr1 ] , [ fig : corr2 ] show the corresponding correlation coefficients .",
    "the values of @xmath241 and @xmath242 have been taken as cases of a small and of a larger data set , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the median time sampling step for the different values of @xmath238 lies approximately within the interval @xmath243 .",
    "a set of frequencies has been examined in the range @xmath244 $ ] . from these figures",
    "it is clear that , in spite of the extremely irregular sampling under examination , significant correlation between @xmath81 and @xmath82 happens only for the small data set . even in this case , the correlation is weak ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath206 depends on the distribution of the angle @xmath223 is supported by figs .",
    "[ fig : angles1 ] , [ fig : angles2 ] where the distribution of the angles @xmath222 on the unit circle is shown for the case @xmath241 and @xmath246 .",
    "it is evident that also with this limited number of data , the distribution of the @xmath223 is approximately uniform and symmetric . for the case",
    "@xmath242 , the distribution ( not shown here ) is even more regular and indeed , as visible in figs .",
    "[ fig : corr1 ] , [ fig : corr2 ] the corresponding correlation coefficients are closer to zero .",
    "figures  [ fig : corr3]-[fig : angles3 ] show the results concerning a few sampling patterns of more astronomical interest . in particular",
    ", for each value of @xmath247 , chosen in the range @xmath248 $ ] , @xmath152 sampling time instants @xmath125 have been generated according to @xmath249 in this way , five equispaced observing sessions of duration @xmath250 are simulated each containing @xmath189 equispaced data and covering a total fraction @xmath247 of the interval @xmath251 $ ] .",
    "adjacent sessions are separated by a gap of length @xmath252 .",
    "[ fig : corr3 ] shows the correlation coefficients @xmath206 for a set of frequencies @xmath75 corresponding to different values of @xmath247 .",
    "again , most of them are small . only for",
    "@xmath253 ( i.e. very large gaps ) and @xmath254 , does @xmath206 attain the value @xmath255 .",
    "[ fig : angles3 ] shows the distribution of the angles @xmath222 on the unit circle computed for @xmath253 .",
    "so significant a correlation is due to a sampling pattern of the type given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : irrs ] ) . a significant correlation",
    "for a given frequency does not imply that the same holds for other frequencies .      for demonstration purposes , we check what happens in the case of an experimental time series with periodic gaps .",
    "as explained above , this is a situation more favorable for a nonuniform distribution of the angles @xmath223 . in this regard , the ls periodogram and the version as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pf ] ) are compared in the case of the light curve of the low mass x - ray binary a source which shows an orbital period of 3.82 hr @xcite .",
    "this object shows 8.3 minute x - ray eclipses every orbital period , irregular dipping activity ( energy - dependent absorption ) and type i x - ray bursts .",
    "has been extensively studied with the x - ray observatory . in particular ,",
    "it was observed on seven occasions during september ",
    "november 2003 for a total exposure time of 570  ks . for each observation",
    ", data were acquired simultaneously with all of the on - board instruments . here ,",
    "we present the light curve of the optical / uv monitor @xcite during 12 - 13 november 2003 .",
    "the data were originally taken with a sampling of 500 ms .",
    "these data are quite noisy and the light curve was rebinned to a sampling of 32 s to increase the signal - to - noise ratio per bin . the sampling of this signal , shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : series ] , is regular but some periodic gaps are present . since these gaps are rather short , we have considered two other situations where larger periodic gaps are obtained by removing @xmath256 and @xmath257 of the data as shown in the central and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : series ] , respectively . in this way a time series with regular sampling and wider periodic gaps is obtained . in spite of the presence of large gaps , from fig .",
    "[ fig : powers ] it clearly appears that the periodogram  ( [ eq : pf ] ) and the ls periodogram when computed for the mean - subtracted signal , are quite similar . as is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : powers1 ] , the same is not true without subtraction of the sampling mean .",
    "this is not surprising since , as shown above , the mean value introduces a spurious correlation between the @xmath81 and @xmath82 coefficients .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the problems related to the spectral analysis of uneven time series .",
    "we have reexamined , with formalized arguments and some numerical experiments , the pros and cons of an even vs. an uneven sampling .    1 .",
    "a regular data sampling simplifies the analysis as well as the development of efficient algorithms .",
    "however , it permits one to retrieve only the frequencies characteristic of the signal that are smaller than the _ nyquist frequency _ ; 2 .",
    "an irregular sampling introduces some computational as well statistical problems but it permits one to retrieve information about frequencies even much greater than the _ nyquist frequency _ ; 3 .",
    "although from the theoretical point of view techniques specific to the spectral analysis of uneven sampled signals such as the lomb - scargle periodogram could be of some interest , their effectiveness in practical astronomical applications is limited .",
    "indeed , approximated but simpler techniques are able to provide similar results and are easier to use and to modify to deal with situations different from those under which the original ls periodogram has been developed .    before concluding , it is necessary to stress that often in astronomy the spectral analysis can be safely used only as a test to check whether a time series contains a signal of interest or",
    "is constituted only of noise .",
    "for example , for both the regular and the irregular sampling , the periodogram can not provide a reliable statistical characterization of a _ red noise _ signal if the experimental time series spans an interval shorter than the time scale of the signal itself .",
    "moreover , in the presence of an irregular sampling and independently of the technique used , the periodogram can not be used to identify the frequencies of a periodic signal because of the `` _ interference _ '' between the true peaks and those due to sampling @xcite . in this case ,",
    "other techniques are necessary ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
