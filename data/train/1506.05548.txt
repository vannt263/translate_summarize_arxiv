    "in contrast to  , the density function   is not known to be expressed as a product of determinants and the process associated with   does not seem to be determinantal .",
    "nevertheless some determinantal formulas for the oconnell - yor polymer have been found : first in  @xcite , oconnell showed a determinantal representation for the moment generating function ( lhs of  ) in terms of the sklyanin measure .",
    "( see   below . )",
    "next in  @xcite , borodin and corwin obtained a fredholm determinant representation for the same moment generating function ( see   below ) .",
    "a direct proof of the equivalence between the two determinantal expressions was given in  @xcite . in  @xcite , by considering its continuous limit , the authors also obtained an explicit representation of the free energy distribution for the directed random polymer in two continuous dimension described by stochastic heat equation ( she )  @xcite .",
    "the distribution in this limit , which describes the universal crossover between the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) and the edwards - wilkinson universality class , was first obtained in  @xcite and can be interpreted also as the height distribution for the kpz equation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore in  @xcite , they consider not only the oconnell - yor model but a class of stochastic processes having the similar fredholm determinant expressions , the macdonald processes , the probability measures on a sequence of partitions which are written in terms of the macdonald symmetric functions and include the whittaker measure defined by   as a limiting case .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate further the mechanism of appearance of such determinantal structures and   is the central formula in our study . although @xmath36 defined by   is not a probability measure but a signed measure except when @xmath25 , a remarkable feature of this measure is that it is _ determinantal _ for arbitrary @xmath37 contrary to the whittaker measure  .",
    "this determinantal structure allows us to use the conventional techniques developed in the random matrix theory and thus from the relation we readily get a fredholm determinant representation with a kernel using biorthogonal functions which is regarded as a generalization of the kernel with the hermite polynomials for the gue . in  , the parameter @xmath37 , which originally represents the inverse temperature in the polymer model appears in the fermi distribution function @xmath38 with the chemical potential @xmath39 as well as @xmath40   in rhs .",
    "this fact with the determinantal structure suggests that the rhs might have something to do with the free fermions at a finite temperature .",
    "related to this , a curious relation of the height of the kpz equation with fermions has been discussed in  @xcite .    for establishing the relation ,",
    "we introduce a measure on a larger space @xmath41 . by integrating the measure in two different ways ,",
    "we get its two marginal weights . in one formula",
    "appears a determinant which solves the @xmath0 dimensional diffusion equation with some condition ( see ,  , and  ) and the other one with a symmetrization is exactly the rhs of  .",
    "the relation   follows immediately from the equivalence of these two expressions .",
    "our approach is similar to the one by warren  @xcite for getting the relation  .",
    "actually in the zero - temperature limit @xmath25 , we see that the integration of the measure is written in terms of the probability measure introduced in  @xcite , which describes the positions of the reflected brownian particles on the gelfand - tsetlin cone .",
    "note that the macdonald processes ( especially the whittaker process in our case )  @xcite are also another generalizations of  @xcite .",
    "although the whittaker process has rich integrable properties , they do not inherit the determinantal structure of  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , our measure is described without using the whittaker functions and keeps the determinantal structure . furthermore combining   with the fact that the quantity can be rewritten",
    "as the fredholm determinant found in @xcite ( corollary  [ corfred ] and proposition  [ propfred2 ] below ) , our approach can be considered as another proof of the equivalence between   and   in  @xcite .",
    "one feature of our proof is to bring to light the larger determinantal structure behind the two relations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , after stating the definition of a determinantal measure , we give our main result , theorem  [ thmmain ] and its proof .",
    "the proof consists of two major steps : we first introduce in lemma  [ lemoc ] a determinantal representation for the moment generating function which is a deformed version of the representation   in  @xcite .",
    "next we introduce another determinantal measure on larger space @xmath41 and then we find two relations about its integrations which play a key role in deriving our main result . in sec .",
    "3 we show that this approach can be considered as an extension of the one in  @xcite . in sec.4 . , we consider the fredholm determinant formula with biorthogonal kernel obtained by applying conventional random matrix techniques to our main result . the scaling limit to the kpz equation",
    "is discussed in sec.5 .",
    "we check that our kernel goes to the one obtained in the studies of the kpz equation . a concluding remark",
