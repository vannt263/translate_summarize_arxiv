    "the excitation of long - lived solitary waves during the interaction of high - intensity laser pulses with plasmas is a topic with applications and of theoretical interest . as multi - dimensional particle in cell ( pic ) simulations",
    "have shown , these waves form behind the laser pulse and they consist of electron density depressions with a trapped intense electromagnetic field oscillating at a frequency well below the laser frequency  @xcite .",
    "solitary waves can propagate towards the plasma - vacuum interface where the stored electromagnetic energy is radiated away in the form of low - frequency electromagnetic bursts  @xcite , a process recently detected in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "bright spots in optical plasma images with the same polarization as the laser pulse have been attributed to the formation of such solitons  @xcite .",
    "these waves can evolve to a state named postsoliton , that has also been observed in the laboratory with proton imaging techniques  @xcite .",
    "the propagation of electromagnetic solitary waves has been intensively investigated within the cold , relativistic , one - dimensional fluid approximation @xcite . restricting attention to circularly polarized travelling wave solutions , with velocity @xmath0 and frequency @xmath1 , yields a pair of second order differential equations that governs the dynamics of the electrostatic potential @xmath3 and the amplitude of the vector potential @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the system describes a langmuir and an electromagnetic wave coupled by the nonlinear terms arising from the perturbation of the density and the relativistic mass .",
    "it admits solitary waves with vanishing ( vbc ) and nonvanishing ( nvbc ) boundary conditions and , even though the governing equations are not completely integrable , they are commonly referred to as solitons .    for vbc , @xmath5 and @xmath6 as @xmath7",
    ", a soliton is interpreted as a light wave which is trapped in a self - generated plasma wave @xcite .",
    "they have been classified according to the number of zeros of the vector potential profile , @xmath8 , see ref .",
    "they are commonly referred to as bright solitons and their stability has been analyzed too @xcite . in @xcite , the existence of such solutions is discussed in the parametric @xmath2 plane and @xmath9 families of solitons are identified .",
    "some of these families end at certain velocity values where the ion density profile shows a cusp at the center of the soliton .",
    "the soliton breaking has been proposed as a mechanism for particle acceleration in high - intensity laser plasma interaction @xcite and it was observed in pic simulations for solitons with @xmath10 and overcritical amplitude @xcite .",
    "solitons with vbc in warm @xcite and magnetized plasmas @xcite have been studied too .    on the other hand , three different solutions with nvbc",
    "are possible @xcite : ( i ) grey solitons ( @xmath11 and @xmath6 as @xmath12 ) , ( ii ) dark solitons ( @xmath13 and @xmath6 as @xmath12 ) and ( iii ) shock waves ( @xmath11 and @xmath6 as @xmath14 and @xmath5 and @xmath15 as @xmath16 ) .",
    "the asymptotic values @xmath17 and @xmath18 are related to the two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the branch of shock waves splits the @xmath2 plane in two different regions where either dark or grey solitons exist .",
    "branches of solutions are found and they break down at increasing @xmath17 due to divergence of the electron density @xcite .    as we will see , the grey and dark solitons with nvbc can be interpreted as a localized modulation in a long circularly polarized electromagnetic wave coupled with a plasma wave . even though the circularly polarized wave is susceptible to the relativistic raman and the modulational instabilities @xcite , the analysis of these solitary structures",
    "is fully justified .",
    "first , the present work extends the discussion about solitary waves with nvbc , that until now was limited to the narrow velocity range , @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "second , the solitary waves could play a role in processes that are faster than the inverse of the parametric instability growth rate .",
    "we also point out that any damping mechanism , not included in the present analysis for simplicity , could reduce or suppress these instabilities .    from the mathematical point of view , the problem of finding solitons reduces , through the traveling wave ansatz , to that of finding orbits of an associated hamiltonian system for @xmath4 and @xmath3 consistent with the boundary conditions of the fluid model for each type of soliton .",
    "the hamiltonian system is four dimensional , time - reversible and autonomous .",
    "it admits four fixed points that , for brevity , will be denoted by the letter @xmath20 and the value of @xmath3 and @xmath4 inside brackets .",
    "only three of them , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , play a role when discussing the existence of solitary waves .",
    "orbits that are asymptotic to an equilibrium as @xmath7 are called _ homoclinic connections _ , while orbits that connect two distinct equilibria in the limits @xmath7 are termed _ heteroclinic connections _ ( see @xcite for a review of homoclinic orbits in reversible systems ) .",
    "therefore , grey solitons , dark solitons and shock waves correspond to the connecting orbits @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "existence and robustness under variations in @xmath0 and @xmath1 of such connecting orbits can be directly inferred by simple geometrical arguments from the theory of dynamical systems , with a critical role played by the properties of the equilibria of the system and in particular their linear stability .",
    "previous works @xcite studied the parametric domain where @xmath26 is a saddle - center , with eigenvalues @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and they found solutions in the velocity range @xmath19 .    here , we extend the analysis to velocities up to @xmath29 , and specifically in regions of the parametric domain where @xmath26 is a saddle - focus , i.e.  its eigenvalues are of the form @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is well known @xcite that homoclinic connections of a saddle - focus in hamiltonian systems do generally exist and are robust against small perturbations of the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore one expects them to appear in continuous families in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "moreover , existence of such a homoclinic orbit , for instance one that corresponds to a one - hump soliton , implies existence of infinitely many of them , corresponding to solitons with a different number of humps @xcite .",
    "taking into account these insights from the theory of dynamical systems , we numerically identify new families of single and multi - hump solitons of the grey and dark varieties that can be interpreted as counterparts to the branches reported for vbc @xcite .",
    "we also report , for the first time , asymmetric solitons in this system and explain the disappearance of certain families of solutions as parameters are varied .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : dynamical ]",
    "the system of equations that governs the dynamics of the solitons is revisited , while its fixed points and their possible connecting orbits are discussed in section [ sec : fp : orbits ] .",
    "section [ sec : algorithm ] describes the spectral algorithm @xcite that we have used to find homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits , as well as some optimizations carried out for our specific problem .",
    "the numerically computed families of dark and grey , symmetric and asymmetric solitons are presented in section [ sec : results ] . in section [ sec : stability ]",
    "the stability of certain types of grey solitons is investigated with the aid of particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations .",
    "the conclusions are summarize in section [ sec : conclusions ] where the similarities and differences with the vbc waves are stressed .",
    "this section briefly summarizes the theory of one - dimensional circularly polarized solitons ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the plasma is assumed to be cold and composed of electrons and ions , denoted by the subscript @xmath31 respectively .",
    "it is convenient to use length , time , velocity , momentum , vector and scalar potential , and density normalized over @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "here @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the unperturbed density , the rest mass and the electron plasma frequency . using this notation the maxwell ( in the coulomb gauge ) and plasma equations read    @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43[sys : general ] where @xmath44 and @xmath3 are the vector and scalar potential , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the kinetic momentum and the fluid velocity respectively . for convenience the dimensionless parameter @xmath49 has been introduced ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 are species charges ) .    taking @xmath52 , the coulomb gauge immediately gives @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the direction perpendicular to @xmath55 .",
    "the transverse component of yields @xmath56 .",
    "we also take all the variables to be functions of @xmath57 and assume a circularly polarized vector potential @xmath58 here , @xmath0 is the group velocity of the solitary wave , @xmath59 is the wavevector and @xmath1 is the frequency in a frame moving with the solitary wave . with the above assumptions , equation and the longitudinal component of can be integrated . imposing the boundary conditions @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 as @xmath64 , the kinetic momentum , energy and the density of each species are functions of just the potentials @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "we remark that , for solutions described by equation , the group velocity of the solitary wave @xmath0 should be equal to the phase velocity @xmath77 .",
    "solutions with different velocities require the addition of a relative phase in equation @xcite .",

    "we note that only orbits connecting the fixed points @xmath86 are consistent with the previously imposed boundary conditions . hence , @xmath26 and their stability properties play an important role when discussing the presence of solitary waves in the full fluid system .",
    "one readily verifies that @xmath21 is a fixed point of system - if the following dispersion relation is satisfied @xmath88 its physical interpretation is evident when we express as a function of the wavevector @xmath89 and the frequency in the laboratory frame @xmath90 @xcite @xmath91 that is the normalized dispersion relation of a pure transverse electromagnetic wave with relativistic effects and the ion motion .",

    "shock waves belong to the parametric domain where @xmath26 is a saddle - center , see figure [ fig : parametric ] , and will not be studied in the present work ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the system has an additional fixed point @xmath112 for velocities @xmath0 greater than @xmath113 ( see appendix [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "as @xmath26 and @xmath112 must share the same value of @xmath114 for a connection to exist , a condition similar to can be obtained , which can not be fullfilled for any value of the parameters and therefore heteroclinic connections involving @xmath112 and @xmath26 are not possible ( see appendix [ sec : appendix ] ) .",

    "we now turn to the discussion of the conditions under which heteroclinic and homoclinic connections , and therefore solitons of the fluid system - are expected to exist .",
    "we will need to recall well known facts from the theory of dynamical systems ( see @xcite , for example ) and introduce the notion of the _ stable ( unstable ) manifold _ @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) of a fixed point @xmath122 , as the set of forward ( backward ) in @xmath76 trajectories that terminate at @xmath122 .",
    "a heteroclinic ( homoclinic ) connection from @xmath123 to @xmath124 ( to itself ) lies on the intersection of the unstable manifold of @xmath123 and the stable manifold of @xmath124 ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "stable and unstable manifolds are complicated objects with intriguing structure and their visualization can become a formidable task ( see @xcite for a review of methods ) . here it will be enough to consider the dimensionality of stable and unstable manifolds , as this dictates whether or not they are in general expected to intersect .",
    "we note that dynamics of the @xmath125-dimensional system - are constrained to a @xmath126-dimensional _ energy - manifold _ by conservation of the invariant @xmath114 , equation .",
    "the intersection of stable and unstable manifolds has to take place within this energy - manifold .",
    "we first discuss homoclinic connections involving @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath26 is a saddle - center , both its stable and unstable manifolds are @xmath127-dimensional and are , in general , not expected to intersect in @xmath126-dimensional space . if they do intersect , they necessarily have to be the same from uniqueness of solutions .",
    "a homoclinic connection is therefore not generic , in the sense that it requires the condition @xmath128 which can only be fullfilled for specific @xmath0 and @xmath1 values .",
    "hence the homoclinic connections in the saddle - center case are expected to occur in branches in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "however , the existence of a continuous spectrum of single - hump solitons when @xmath26 is a saddle - center has been suggested for vbc @xcite and nvbc @xcite boundary conditions . unless further restrictions are imposed ,",
    "such a continuous spectrum has to be interpreted as a numerical artifact , only valid within the accuracy of long - time integration of system - .",
    "nevertheless , singular cases could arise .",
    "for instance , at the @xmath10 case where the dynamics is @xmath129-dimensional , it can be proved analytically that standing solitary wave solutions exist within a continuous @xmath1 range @xcite .    in the saddle - focus case on the other hand , @xmath130 and @xmath131",
    "are @xmath129-dimensional and are in general expected to intersect transversally along a @xmath127-dimensional curve in the @xmath126-dimensional energy - manifold .",
    "therefore we expect homoclinic solutions to exist generically in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "furthermore it is well known that , for given parameters , if one such transverse intersection exists then there exist infinitely many , which have been shown to form a local , complete horseshoe structure @xcite . in our case this implies that for any one - hump soliton we can find an associated family of multi - hump solitons for any given @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the symmetry properties of - help us deduce more properties of the connecting orbits .",
    "equations - are invariant under the reflection symmetry , @xmath132 . as a result , for any homoclinic @xmath133 connection there exists an identically shaped @xmath134 one .",
    "note that , since we impose inhomogeneous boundary conditions , we can not have reflection invariant connections .",
    "moreover , reflection symmetry allows us to carry many of the results available for homoclinic orbits over to heteroclinic orbits involving @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( dark solitons ) ; the two equilibria can be considered as a single equilibrium in a reduced system in which @xmath4 is identified with @xmath137 and in which heteroclinic connections become homoclinic @xcite",
    ". therefore we can expect heteroclinic orbits in the saddle - focus parametric regime to occur generically .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath24 connection has an identically shaped @xmath138 counterpart .",
    "system - is also time - reversible , that is invariant under simultaneous change of sign of @xmath76 and the generalized momenta @xmath139 , @xmath140 . as a result ,",
    "homoclinic orbits can either be symmetric ( self - dual , @xmath141 ) or come in pairs of asymmetric orbits related by time - reversal .",
    "similarly , heteroclinic connections @xmath24 have to be either antisymmetric functions of @xmath76 ( @xmath142 ) or come in asymmetric pairs , related by @xmath76-reversal .",
    "note that the antisymmetric heteroclinic solitons are associated with the combined action of @xmath76-reversal and reflection .",
    "asymmetric homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits in @xmath76-reversible hamiltonian systems are well studied @xcite , but to our knowledge they appear here for the first time in the context of relativistic solitons , see section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the addition of a perturbation that breaks the conserved quantity @xmath114 but preserves the reversibility would destroy asymmetric solutions @xcite .    for later use , we introduce the so - called _ symmetric section _",
    "@xmath143 , which is in a sense a symmetry hyperplane of the system , as any point in it is left invariant under @xmath76-reversal .",
    "symmetric homoclinic orbits have to intersect @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "as we will see in section [ sec : results ] symmetric homoclinic orbits can disappear through a mechanism referred to as _ coalescence _",
    "@xcite , as a result of which the stable and unstable manifolds fail to intersect on the symmetric section @xmath144 .",
    "due to time reversibility , the computation of symmetric homoclinic or antisymmetric heteroclinic orbits of - involves the solution of a boundary value problem on the semi - infinite interval ( @xmath145 ) . within the regime where @xmath26 is a saddle - center and the unstable",

    "we used a newton - raphson algorithm with its jacobian calculated analytically to speed up the convergence .    since system -",
    "does not include the first derivatives of the variables @xmath174 on the right - hand side , we have directly computed the second derivative .",
    "this is a difference from the general scheme given in reference @xcite that allows us to divide by two the number of coefficients .",
    "note also that for asymmetric solutions all the coefficients must be calculated whereas in the case of symmetric or antisymmetric solutions just one half of the coefficients are needed ( for instance symmetric grey solitons are even solutions and @xmath175 ) .",

    "it can also be built up from pieces of symmetric solutions of different parity , smoothed by dropping the high order coefficients .",
    "similarly , guesses for multi - hump solutions can be built up from single hump solutions of appropriate shape .",
    "once we have a good initial guess , the spectral algorithm gives an accurate solution that can be used as initial guess for other parameter values .",
    "we finally remark that the accuracy of the solutions can be checked by testing the spectral convergence : a plot of the logarithm of the coeficients @xmath154 versus the order @xmath59 should decay linearly .",
    "this is an advantage as compared to the truncation of the interval methods where the error is controlled by the initial distance to the fixed point which is fixed arbitrarily .",

    "this suggests that certain families of orbits can cease to exist when the corresponding manifolds fail to intersect in the neighborhood of the solitary solution .",

    "however , since the growth rates of these instabilities are controlled by the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave ( @xmath17 in our dynamical system ) and the plasma density ( related to the parameter @xmath1 ) , certain parameter values could allow long distance propagation of the solitons .    to test the stability of the solitary waves we show a couple of 1-dimensional simulations with the pic code calder @xcite .",

    "it was estimated that ions could reach an energy value of the order of 70 mev .",
    "similarly , in the present work we have presented domains of existence in the @xmath224 plane and we have shown that coalescence of solitary waves ( in parameter space ) leads to disappeance of families of solutions .",

    ", 2-dimensional simulations revealed that all solutions are unstable and the tranverse dynamics always dominates the longitudinal one @xcite .",
    "our pic simulations initialized with a grey solitary wave showed that some of them could propagate undistorted during a few tens of @xmath33 , just before the circularly polarized wave suffers the raman instability .",
    "however , other grey waves radiate a portion of their energy from the trailing edge , similarly to the multi - hump solutions with vbc @xcite .",
    "since these are just a few examples , a complete stability analysis would requiry the study of other types of solutions ( dark waves , asymmetric , multi - humps etc ) in the whole @xmath224 plane . adding warm plasma effects or a collision term would be relevant too .",
    "besides existence and stability , the question about how to excite solitary waves with nvbc remains open .",
    "however , soliton - like electromagnetic modes with vbc have been observed during laser plasma interaction @xcite .",
