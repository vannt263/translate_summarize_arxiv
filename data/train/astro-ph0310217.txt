    "the question if ( and by how much ) metallicity has any effect on the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation is far from being settled .",
    "recent theoretical studies give different results : some authors claim that metallicity has negligible effects on the pl relation ( baraffe & alibert 2001 , alibert et al .",
    "1999 ; sandage et al .",
    "1999 ) ; others find that there is a significant dependence of the pl relation on metallicity ( bono et al .",
    "1999 ; caputo et al .",
    "2000 ; fiorentino et al . 2002 ) .",
    "although most of the observational efforts aiming at deriving the chemical composition of cepheids and its effects on the pl relation have used indirect means , like the measurement of o  ii in hii regions ( e.g. beaulieu et al .",
    "1997 ; sasselov et al .",
    "1997 ; kennicutt et al .",
    "1998 ; macri et al .",
    "2001 ) , some of them have focused on a full and direct chemical analysis ( fry & carney 1997 ; andrievsky et al .",
    "2002a , b ; luck et al .",
    "the goal of our project is to follow this second approach , i.e. to make a direct determination of the metallicity in a newly observed sample of cepheid stars .",
    "the data - set has been assembled according to the following selection criteria : a large coverage of metallicities ( hence , we selected stars from three different galaxies : the smc , the lmc , and our own ) ; the availability of well - determined intensity - mean magnitudes in the b , v , j , h , and k bands ( cf berdnikov & caldwell 2001 ; groenewegen 1999 ; laney & stobie 1994 , laney & stobie 1992 ) ; a wide range of periods in order to cover the entire pl relation ( hence we chose objects from 2 to 98 days of period ) ; the availability of hipparcos parallaxes for all galactic cepheids .",
    "our sample includes a total of 76 stars : 40 galactic , 22 lmc , and 14 smc cepheids .",
    "the magellanic cepheids have been observed with uves ( r=40,000 , spectral coverage : 480680  nm ) at the eso - vlt and have typical s / n of the order of 50 on the eev ccd ( i.e. for 480@xmath0580  nm ) and @xmath170 on the mit ccd ( i.e. for 580@xmath0 680  nm ) .",
    "the spectra of the galactic sample , instead , have been collected with feros ( r=45,000 , spectral coverage : 380880  nm ) at the eso 1.5 m telescope in la silla .",
    "the typical s / n of these spectra is @xmath170 up to @xmath2=500  nm , but larger than 150 in the red .",
    "after the spectra were reduced with the help of the feros and uves data reduction software pipelines , our main goal has been to develop a reliable analytical procedure in order to accurately determine the iron abundance of these stars .",
    "first , we carefully assembled a reliable list of iron lines ( both neutral and ionized ) .",
    "we started from a preliminary selection from the vald database ( kupka et al .",
    "1999 ; piskunov et al .",
    "1995 ) choosing lines between 450 and 650  nm , for effective temperatures typical of cepheids ( 4500 - 6500  k ) .",
    "every line profile was then visually inspected on the observed spectra in order to detect ( and eliminate ) those lines affected by other elemental blends .",
    "secondly we measured the equivalent widths ( ews ) of all the lines assembled as described above . to do this , we tested two methods : we used the gaussian fitting option offered by the task _ splot _ in iraf ; we then developed an idl routine ( based on the _ line_width _ widget available in the fuse idl suite of tools ) in order to speed up the process , but keeping the whole procedure interactive .    with a final list of reliable equivalent widths in hand ,",
    "we then made use of the code width9 ( kurucz 1993 ) for the computation of our final iron abundances .",
    "for this purpose , we chose the kurucz grid of lte model atmospheres ( kurucz 1993 ) .",
    "however , before being able to derive [ fe / h]=log(fe / h)@xmath3 - log(fe / h)@xmath4 values from our measured ews , one clearly needs to know the stellar parameters of the stars , i.e. their effective temperature , gravity , and microtubulent velocity .",
    "we derived a first guess set of stellar parameters from the photometry available in the literature ( see references given in section 2 ) and determine spectroscopically the final set to be used in the analysis .",
    "this is an interactive process that requires running the code width9 , with our final list of ews and different model atmospheres , in order to find which model is able to minimize simultaneously the slope of log@xmath5(fe ) _ vs _ ew and _ vs _ the excitation potential ( these constrain the microturbulence and the temperature respectively ) while keeping the ionization balance ( i.e. the abundance derived from fe  i and from fe  ii must agree)to constrain the gravity .",
    "once such model was identified for each individual star , we were finally able to compute the iron abundance of all our stars .",
    "we have determined the iron abundances for a sub - sample of stars : 14 galactic , 14 lmc and 22 smc cepheids .",
    "figure 1 of romaniello et al .",
    "( this volume ) summarises this preliminary set of results .    despite the confidence we have gained in the analytical steps tested sofar",
    ", we still have a lot of work in front of us . in the very near future ,",
    "we want to optimize our line - list ( both for the number of lines to be used and for a careful check of their gf - values ) , to complete the analysis for the entire sample , and to determine iron abundances also via spectrum synthesis .",
    "a little bit more into the future , we plan to perform the full chemical analysis of the entire data - set ( with special attention devoted to the @xmath6 and to the heavy elements ) ."
