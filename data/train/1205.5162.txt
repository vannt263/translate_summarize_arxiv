    "while dual transformations may allow converting a combinatorial geometry problem about a _ configuration of points _ into a problem about an _ arrangement of lines _ , or reversely , the truth is that most mathematical questions appear to be much cleaner and natural in only one of the settings . in many cases ,",
    "the dual version is considered solely when , besides making sense , it is additionally useful . both kinds of geometric objects have inspired many problems and attracted much attention .",
    "for finite point sets the _ erds - szekeres problem _ on finding large subsets in convex position , or the _ repeated distances problem _ on how many times can a single distance appear between pairs of points , are examples of famous questions that have been pursued for decades and are still open .",
    "many research problems of this kind are described in chapter 8 in @xcite .",
    "concerning arrangements of lines , possibly the most prevalent problems consist of studying the number of cells of each size , say triangles , that appear in every arrangement , but many other issues have been considered ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are also problems that combine both kinds of objects , like counting incidences between points and lines , or studying the arrangements of lines spanned by point sets , which includes the celebrated _ sylvester - gallai problem _ on ordinary lines ( those that only contain two of the points ) @xcite .    in the first class of problems ,",
    "substantial attention has been focusing on _ colored pointsets _",
    ", i.e. , configurations of points that belong to several classes , the _ colors _ , including chromatic variants of the repeated distances problem and the erds - szekeres problem , and colored versions of _ tverberg s theorem _ and _ helly s theorem_. in particular there is a vast body of research on problems involving a set of _ red _ points and a set of _ blue _ points .",
    "refer to @xcite for a survey on red - blue problems , or to @xcite for a more generic account .",
    "somehow surprisingly , there is not a comparable set of questions that have been posed for colored arrangements of lines .",
    "there is a series of papers on the problem of taking bicolored sets of lines , calling _",
    "monochromatic vertex _ an intersection point contained only in lines of one of the colors , and discussing their existence and number @xcite .",
    "another series of papers study the colorings of the so called arrangement graphs , in which vertices are the intersection points and edges are the segments between any two that are consecutive on one of the lines @xcite .    however , many other natural questions can be asked .",
    "for example , is it true that every bicolored arrangement of lines has a monochromatic cell ?",
    "we prove in this paper that the generic answer is no , but that it is yes when the colors are slightly unbalanced .",
    "this leads immediately to another question that we discuss in our work : how many colors are always sufficient , and occasionally necessary , to color any set of @xmath8 lines in such a way that the induced arrangement contains no monochromatic cell ?",
    "the last question brings manifestly the flavor of _ art gallery problems _ @xcite .",
    "we also consider for line arrangements several issues on this topic that apparently have not been studied before : how many vertices of an arrangement suffice to guard all its cells ?",
    "how many lines are enough to guard ( touch ) all the cells ?    while coloring and guarding arrangements of lines may appear at first glance as unrelated problems , there is a clean unifying framework provided by considering appropriate geometric hypergraphs . for example , minimally coloring an arrangement while avoiding monochromatic cells can be reformulated as follows : let @xmath1 be the geometric hypergraph where vertices are lines and edges represent cells of the arrangement .",
    "what is the chromatic number of the hypergraph ? here a proper coloring is one where no hyperedge is monochromatic .    in this work we consider several questions as the ones described in the preceding paragraphs , which arise as quite fundamental in terms of coloring and guarding arrangements of lines , and translate consistently into problems on geometric hypergraphs , like size of a maximal independent set , size of a vertex cover , or some coloring parameter .",
    "the terminology for hypergraphs on arrangements is introduced in section [ sec : definitions ] , where we also provide a table summarizing our results .",
    "coloring problems are then discussed in section [ sec : coloring ] and guarding problems in section [ sec : guarding ] .",

    "we first consider the chromatic number of the line - cell hypergraph of an arrangement , that is , the number of colors required for coloring the lines so that no cell has a monochromatic boundary . at the end of the section we include some similar results .",

    "an infinite family of such examples are provided by a set of @xmath32 lines in convex position ( for any @xmath33 , see figure  [ fig : bichrom]).observe that in such arrangement , each cell is either bounded by @xmath34 two consecutive lines , @xmath35 the first and the last line or @xmath36 all lines of the arrangement .",
    "it is easy to check that , if we color the lines alternatively red and blue by order of slope , no cell will be monochromatic .",
    "the coloring used in theorem [ prop:2colors ] uses essentially the same number of lines of each color .",
    "we prove next that the result can not hold when the numbers are unbalanced to a small extent .",
    "each color class of a proper 2-coloring @xmath37 of a set @xmath9 of @xmath8 lines has size at most @xmath38 .",

    "let @xmath43 denote the arrangement of the lines in @xmath39 .",
    "as @xmath39 does not completely define a cell of @xmath44 , each cell of @xmath43 must be traversed by a line in @xmath41 .",
    "we proceed iteratively : we start with @xmath43 , and add the lines in @xmath41 one at a time . when adding a line @xmath17 , some cells of @xmath43 will be split into two parts by a line segment induced by @xmath17",
    ". a connected component of segments inside a cell of @xmath43 is a set of segments whose intersection graph is connected .",
    "to each cell @xmath0 of @xmath43 , we assign a number , representing the number of connected components defined by the segments inside @xmath0 .",

    "therefore , @xmath52 .",
    "in general , when the @xmath46 line @xmath53 is added , @xmath54 increases by @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , in each cell @xmath0 , the blue line can only intersect each component once , otherwise the corresponding segments would create a cycle , meaning a new face bounded only by blue lines , and thus monochromatic .",
    "this implies that @xmath53 intersects all previous @xmath56 lines in @xmath56 disjoint components .",

    "thus @xmath61 should be bigger or equal to the number of cells in @xmath60 .",
    "recall that an independent set of lines in an arrangement is defined as a subset of lines @xmath4 so that no cell of the arrangement is only adjacent to lines in @xmath4 .",

    "we choose one such cell for each line @xmath67 , and call this cell @xmath69 .",
    "then , we consider the set @xmath70 of quadrants defined by the intersections of the lines in @xmath68 , each intersection defining 4 quadrants . if @xmath69 has size at least 3 for some @xmath67 , then we charge @xmath17 to one of the quadrant of @xmath70 formed by the intersection of two lines of @xmath68 on the boundary of @xmath69 .",
