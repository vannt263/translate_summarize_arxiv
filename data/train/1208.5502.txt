    "<S> recent measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy of direct photons in heavy - ion collisions at the energies of rhic show that it is of the same order as the hadronic one . </S>",
    "<S> this finding appears to contradict the expected dominance of photon production from a quark - gluon plasma at an early stage of a heavy - ion collision . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation of the strong azimuthal anisotropy of the photons , given recently , is based on the presence of a large magnetic field in the early phase of a collision . in this letter , we propose a method to experimentally measure the degree to which a magnetic field in heavy - ion collisions is responsible for the observed anisotropy of photon production . the experimental test proposed in this letter may potentially change our understanding of the non - equilibrium stage and possible thermalization in heavy - ion collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to hadronic observables , which strongly are influenced by the final state of the fireball created in a heavy - ion collision , the `` direct '' photons leave the fireball almost without interacting with the medium  @xcite , and thus they may play an important role in unraveling the properties of hot and dense matter . according to expectations , based on the large yield of thermal photons , photon production is believed to be dominated by the hottest phase , quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at the early stage of a collision at the top energies in rhic ( brookhaven ) and the lhc ( cern ) . </S>",
    "<S> measurements from the phenix collaboration showed that the observed temperature of photon radiation at energy @xmath0 gev in heavy - ion collisions is about @xmath1 mev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this value can be considered as an average over the entire evolution of the matter created in heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> it is higher than the temperature of the phase transition and thus it supports the picture of photon production from the quark - gluon stage of the collision . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative explanation of the apparent high temperature of the photon source is the formation of prethermal glasma shining photons early in a collision  @xcite . in both scenarios </S>",
    "<S> , we would expect that the photons azimuthal anisotropy , characterized by the second fourier component @xmath2 is small  @xcite , because , at the early qgp stage , the evolving medium does not develop an appreciable amount of azimuthal anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> others studied this phenomenon in hydrodynamic calculations that well describe hadron production and hadron azimuthal anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite , as expected , demonstrated that the photon @xmath3 is almost an order of magnitude smaller than the one of hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account fluctuating initial conditions or viscosity does not significantly increase @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent measurements by the phenix collaboration revealed that the anisotropy of produced photons is very close to that of hadrons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this finding might be explained in several ways . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , van hees and collaborators  @xcite investigated how the fireball s evolution is constrained by the photon azimuthal anisotropy . to describe the photon spectra it was required to introduce a large acceleration of the fireball s expansion ; this , however , is not present in conventional hydrodynamical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we can assume that another unknown mechanism exists that is responsible for photon anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> such mechanism was recently proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the presence of a large highly anisotropic magnetic field in heavy - ion collisions that could serve as a natural source of the photons anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> it is maximal at the early stage of a collision , thereby allowing us to reconcile the large thermal yield of photons with significant azimuthal anisotropy .    </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the magnetic field was recognized in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , wherein the chiral magnetic effect  @xcite was proposed and studied . the results of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showed that in non - central heavy ion collisions the amplitude of magnetic field can reach very high values up to a few @xmath4 gauss . </S>",
    "<S> this field is large at the time of the collision and decreases inversely proportional to the square of time . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field essentially is anisotropic and , on average , points in the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane . </S>",
    "<S> it also was demonstrated  @xcite that event - by - event fluctuations of the magnetic ( and electric ) field may play an important role on the level of relevant observables .    according to the calculations of several researchers  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> photons are emitted in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> different microscopic mechanisms of this emission were proposed recently , including the synchrotron radiation of photons from moving charged quarks  @xcite , and that reflecting the scale anomaly of qcd@xmath5qed  @xcite and owing to the axial anomaly  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the last two mechanisms generate photons even in case of a vanishing quark number , which is probably a good approximation for the early stage when the magnetic field is significant . </S>",
    "<S> the estimates given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showed that photon production from the conformal anomaly makes a considerable contribution to @xmath6 and potentially can describe the measured data .     </S>",
    "<S> for the centrality class 30 - 40% in au - au collisions at @xmath7=200 gev . </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]    the question arises , as to how this could be experimentally establish if the photons responsible for azimuthal asymmetry are produced from hadronic sources ( or more generally from a non - zero eccentricity of the fireball ) , or from the quark - gluon plasma in the presence of a high magnetic field at early times . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an observable that can single out the mechanism responsible for producing the azimuthal anisotropy of photons in heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss other experimental signatures that may help to clarify the situation .    to proceed further , we first recall some properties of the magnetic field in heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the major contribution to the magnetic field originates from the spectator protons of the colliding nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the charged particles produced may influence the magnetic field ; however , this effect is not expected to suffice to overcome the field of spectators at early times ( see , e.g. , transport model calculations in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , at a given centrality class the average magnetic field almost is independent of the fluctuating shape of the interaction region and the eccentricity @xmath8 of the initial state ; this problem was studied in more detail in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this feature will allow us to distinguish between different mechanisms of @xmath6 production . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that , in the first approximation , the eccentricity and the magnetic field are linear growing functions of the impact parameter . </S>",
    "<S> thus both mechanisms responsible for @xmath9 , hadronic flow and magnetic field , generate approximately the same qualitative dependence of @xmath10 on centrality . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , this dependence can not be used as a discriminative test of photon production .    </S>",
    "<S> it is commonly accepted that hadronic flow in nucleus - nucleus collisions is defined by the initial state s eccentricity , @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state s eccentricity is not only defined by the geometry of the collision , but also by glauber and `` intrinsic '' fluctuations ( see e.g.  refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first are related to the fluctuations of the nucleon positions in the colliding nuclei , while the second represents the fluctuations of the energy deposition from interacting nucleons and their constituents . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , even in peripheral collisions the initial eccentricity @xmath11 strongly fluctuates leading to a broad range of values , as detailed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where this problem was studied in the context of the chiral magnetic effect @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we show the probability distribution of events as a function of the eccentricity @xmath8 for the centrality class @xmath12 in au - au collisions at @xmath0 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this result is obtained by using the standard glauber model for the initial state  @xcite . as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] the eccentricity distribution is quite wide , so we expect the same behavior for measured hadronic elliptic flow , denoted in this letter by @xmath13 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] the magnetic field asymmetry @xmath14 , entering to the photon production rate of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is shown . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are performed by taking into account fluctuating proton positions in colliding nuclei . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] the magnetic field is almost independent of the initial eccentricity for a given centrality class . </S>",
    "<S> we also checked that with a good precision , the average magnetic field @xmath15 coincides with @xmath14 .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 denote the out - of - plane and in - plane components of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]    essentially , there are two competing mechanisms that can contribute greatly to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the first `` hadronic '' mechanism  @xcite is related to the initial anisotropy of the fireball  @xmath11 : @xmath17the second mechanism reflects the presence of a strong magnetic field in the initial stage of a collision , where @xmath18 in the case of the scale anomaly of qcd@xmath5qed  @xcite and the axial anomaly  @xcite , and @xmath19for synchrotron radiation , as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . here , @xmath20 and @xmath16 respectively </S>",
    "<S> denote the out - of - plane and in - plane components of the magnetic field .     at a given @xmath21 as a function of the integrated elliptic flow for pions @xmath22 for three possible scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) dashed ( red ) line : @xmath23 is dominated by the initial eccentricity @xmath24 . here @xmath25 should be proportional to @xmath26 since @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) solid ( black ) line : @xmath28 is generated solely by the strong magnetic field . in this case @xmath23 should be approximately independent of @xmath22 since the magnetic field at a given narrow centrality class weakly depends on the fluctuating value of eccentricity @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) dotted ( blue ) line : the case with equal contribution of @xmath24- and @xmath30-generated @xmath28 . in this schematic plot </S>",
    "<S> we assume that , averaged over centrality class , @xmath31 , and @xmath32.,width=302 ]    owing to eccentricity fluctuations at a given centrality class ( or even at a given impact parameter ) , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , we can select events with different values of the hadronic elliptic flow @xmath13 , while centrality fixes the magnetic field , as we demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . in the limiting case , viz . </S>",
    "<S> , in non - central collisions of a certain centrality , we may select events with zero eccentricity and , consequently , with zero hadronic flow . this choice will eliminate contribution from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hadronic ] ) . if the magnetic field is responsible for the photon azimuthal anisotropy via eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ scale ] ) or ( [ synch ] ) , we still would observe a non - zero @xmath3 even for vanishing hadronic @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the following three points summarize our idea to determine the mechanism of @xmath6 :    * first we choose a relatively narrow centrality class ( e.g. , @xmath12 ) defined by the number of particles in the mid - rapidity region , or , if possible , by measuring forward neutrons and protons . * given the centrality class , in each event we measure the value of the elliptic flow , @xmath33 , for all pions in the hydrodynamic region ( say @xmath34 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is commonly accepted that @xmath33 reflects the initial eccentricity , @xmath11 , of the fireball in the transverse direction . due to the fluctuations in positions of the participants , we obtain a broad range of @xmath11 and consequently @xmath33 . * finally , we measure the elliptic flow for photons @xmath35 for different values of @xmath33 . the magnetic field mainly is determined by the number of participants / spectators , and is rather independent of the fluctuating values of @xmath11 in a given narrow centrality class , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath6 results solely from the initial eccentricity then it should be proportional to @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> on the contrary , if the magnetic field dominates @xmath6 , it should be independent of @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1 ] illustrates this idea , wherein we present three possible situations : the photon anisotropy @xmath6 is generated solely by the initial anisotropy ; @xmath6 is generated by the magnetic field ; and both mechanisms are present with equal strengths .    before concluding , several comments are warranted . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement discussed in this letter is best suited for mid - central and peripheral collisions , where both the elliptic flow and fluctuations of the initial eccentricity are expected to be maximal . </S>",
    "<S> also , the measurement should be performed for various values of photon transverse momenta </S>",
    "<S> . possibly , different mechanisms of generating @xmath6 may be applicable in different @xmath21 regions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the analysis should be performed in a narrow centrality class , e.g. @xmath12 , so allowing to neglect the correlation between @xmath33 and the impact parameter ( and consequently , the value of the magnetic field ) . </S>",
    "<S> should be performed for a sufficiently broad rapidity window to ensure that the final multiplicity of hadrons and their azimuthal anisotropy adequately reflects the initial eccentricity , i.e. , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of hadrons used to determine @xmath38    as was suggested in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , another probe for illuminating the mechanism of photon production lies in the study of u - u collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the deformed shape of the u nucleus may allow to separate the eccentricity of the initial condition from the magnitude of the magnetic field  @xcite .    other crucial tests that can be performed to test the role of the magnetic field in heavy - ion collisions include :    * the violation of scaling @xmath39 , which was observed for charged hadrons at phenix  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> according to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the anisotropic contribution to the photon production rate in a magnetic field is proportional to @xmath40 which only gives the second harmonics for azimuthal angle distribution . </S>",
    "<S> thus we expect @xmath41 for photons produced in a magnetic field . * </S>",
    "<S> while measurements of @xmath42 require high statistics , it is sufficient to measure @xmath43 , which in the first approximation is zero for photons produced in a magnetic field .    in conclusion , we reiterate that the recent phenix data on the photons azimuthal anisotropy raises new challenging problems for the theoretical description of heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this data either questions the conventional picture of early thermalization and subsequent hydrodynamics of heavy ion collisions , or infers the existence of a new mechanism of photon production , i.e. , contingent upon the magnetic field that can create substantial photon azimuthal anisotropy . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we proposed a measurement of elliptic flow of photons @xmath44 as a function of integrated elliptic flow of pions @xmath45 , in a given narrow centrality class , e.g. , @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement will test both mechanisms of photon production due either to the initial eccentricity or the strong magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that the proposed measurement would be useful both at rhic and the lhc and , eventually , would allow to solve the puzzle of a large photon azimuthal anisotropy in heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we again stress that this may radically change our understanding of the non - equilibrium stage and thermalization in heavy - ion collisions . </S>"
