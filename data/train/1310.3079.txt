    "the thermodynamics of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has received much attention due to the possible existence of new phases of nuclear matter at sufficiently high temperatures and densities , such as the quark - gluon plasma  @xcite . the phase transition from a confined to a deconfined phase",
    "is characterized by a change of order parameters connected with different symmetries of the system .",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom in the deconfined phase are quarks and gluons , while in the confined phase these constituents form color singlet bound states and mostly resonances , i.e. hadrons and possibly glueballs .",
    "when physical quark masses are considered , recent lattice simulations indicate that this transition is actually a hadron  quark - gluon crossover  @xcite .",
    "the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model is a useful approach to describe the thermodynamics of qcd in the confined phase .",
    "it is based on the assumption that physical observables in this phase admit a representation in terms of hadronic states which are treated as non - interacting and point - like particles  @xcite .",
    "these states are usually taken as the conventional hadrons listed in the review by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , so the completeness of the pdg states is assumed . a commonly used order parameter for the hadron  quark - gluon crossover is the polyakov loop in the fundamental representation , as it is related to the free energy of a heavy quark `` @xmath0 '' placed in a thermal medium  @xcite",
    ", @xmath1 where @xmath2 indicates path ordering and @xmath3 is the euclidean time component of the gluon field . while the hrg model has been traditionally applied to study the equation of state of qcd , a similar hadronic representation for the polyakov loop in the fundamental representation was recently formulated in  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been confronted with recent lattice data and confirmed the accuracy of the model for temperatures in the range @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the polyakov loop in any other representation can be computed in lattice qcd , and the existence of casimir scaling relations has been guessed from lowest order perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the hadronic representation to other representations besides the fundamental one is a natural step forward which could be used to test the existence of exotic states in the qcd spectrum . in this communication",
    "we briefly overview the hrg model , and study its realization within a particular quark model .",
    "we advance some results for the polyakov loop in the representations @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "qcd is accepted nowadays as the fundamental theory of strong interactions . the qcd lagrangian @xmath9 \\ , , \\label{eq : lagrangian_qcd}\\ ] ] describes the dynamics of quarks @xmath10 and gluons @xmath11 , which are the fundamental fields in the theory .",
    "@xmath12 is constructed to be invariant under color gauge transformations .",

    "( [ eq : z_qcd ] ) the bosonic and fermionic fields obey periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions in the euclidean time , respectively , with periodicity @xmath14 .",
    "these boundary conditions are preserved under periodic gauge transformations .    in the massless",
    "quarks limit @xmath15 , the theory is invariant at the classical level under scale transformations .",
    "this symmetry is broken by quantum corrections through the inevitable regularization , leading to a non - zero value for the interaction measure or trace anomaly @xmath16 . in this limit , @xmath12  is also invariant under chiral transformations , which are spontaneously broken by the chiral condensate in the vacuum @xmath17 . at high enough temperature ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath18 , the chiral symmetry is restored , and this is signaled by a vanishing value of @xmath19 .    in the opposite limit of infinitely heavy quarks @xmath20 ,",
    "there is a larger symmetry related to the center @xmath21 of the gauge group , as gauge transformations which are periodic in euclidean time modulo an element of the center are allowed , i.e. @xmath22 , @xmath23 . in the polyakov gauge @xmath24 ,",
    "an example of such a transformation is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , under which the polyakov loop transforms as @xmath27 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : transf_lt ] ) it follows that @xmath28 vanishes in the @xmath21 symmetric phase .",
    "this means that the heavy quark free energy diverges , corresponding then to a confined phase .",
    "likewise a non @xmath21 symmetric phase is characterized by a non - vanishing value of the polyakov loop , leading to finite free energy which corresponds to a deconfined phase .",
    "so the polyakov loop can be used as an order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement phase transition in qcd in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "the picture that emerges is that in qcd there are two phase transitions : one related to chiral symmetry , and another one related to confinement ( or center symmetry ) , with transition temperatures @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , which are quark - mass dependent . in the real world , because of finite quark masses , the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop are approximate order parameters only , and lattice simulations predict @xmath32  @xcite . the physical mechanism behind the close agreement between both transitions remains unclear , a situation that worsens for finite quark chemical potential , where lattice simulation are on more shaky grounds .",
    "while in the deconfined phase of qcd the quarks and gluons are liberated to form a plasma , in the confined / chiral symmetry broken phase the relevant degrees of freedom are hadronic states .",
    "the idea of the hrg model is to describe the equation of state of qcd in terms of a free gas of hadrons  @xcite , @xmath33 with @xmath34 the degeneracy factor , @xmath35 for bosons and fermions respectively , and @xmath36 the hadron mass .",
    "the hagedorn formula for the trace anomaly follows from eq .",

    "@xmath43 represents the number of hadrons with mass less than  @xmath44 .",

    "in the confined phase the static source ( heavy quark or gluon ) is screened by dynamical quarks and gluons from the medium to form a heavy hadron ( or glueball ) . within the present approach , we retain the confining forces that give rise to the hadron , but neglect the interaction of this hadron to other dynamical hadrons present in the resonance gas , i.e. non - confining forces .",
