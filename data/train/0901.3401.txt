    "hot jupiters are jupiter - mass planets located within @xmath0 au from their parent stars . unlike jupiter and saturn in the solar system ,",
    "hot jupiters are exposed to stellar irradiations that are much larger than their intrinsic fluxes .",
    "consequently , a deep radiative outer layer develops on the top of a convective interior in a hot jupiter ( e.g. see guillot 2005 for a review ) .",
    "infrared observations of hot - jupiter planetary systems with the spitzer space telescope have been able to measure temperature variations and therefore infer temperature distributions on hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a number of numerical simulations have been developed to investigate atmospheric circulation on a synchronized or non - synchronized hot jupiter to better ascertain the origins of temperature distributions ( see showman et al .",
    "2007 for a review ) .",
    "despite the fact that these simulations are based on different equations and assumptions , and will thus exhibit different flow features , the simulated atmospheres usually end up with differential rotations such as banded structure or vertical shear . although the flow patterns deviating from the initial uniform rotation are certainly the result of planetary rotation , the exact mechanism of how angular momentum is transported and redistributed between different regions of the atmosphere is yet to be established .    when a global atmospheric flow follows non - synchronous rotation , the flow experiences a variation of stellar irradiation which serves as thermal forcing on the flow , producing thermal tides . unlike ocean semi - diurnal tides which are driven by differential lunar gravity ,",
    "the semi - diurnal oscillation of the atmospheric surface pressure on the earth has been known to be mainly excited by the differential solar heating @xcite . in a state of quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium , the gravitational tide in the ocean and solid earth and the thermal tide in the atmosphere can be modelled as gravitational and thermal bulges respectively ( see cartwright 2000 for a historical account ) . in the case of the earth ,",
    "the thermal bulge and the gravitational bulge have opposite phase difference with respect to the sun @xcite , meaning that the gravitational torques on the thermal bulge and on the gravitational bulge are pointing in opposite directions .",
    "since venus has a denser atmosphere and receives more solar insolation than the earth , thermal tides on venus are expected to be more prominent .",
    "this idea has inspired a number of models attempting to explain the slow retrograde spin of venus by means of a balance between the torques due to gravitational and thermal tides @xcite .",
    "laskar & correia 2004 ( cf .",
    "showman & guillot 2002 ) even postulated that thermal tides may drive hot jupiters away from synchronous rotation .",
    "this postulation suggests a mechanism of generating internal tidal heat in hot jupiters and may lend support to the tidal inflation model ( bodenheimer et al .",
    "2001 ; mardling 2007 and references therein ) in explaining why some of the transiting hot jupiters are larger than indicated by current interior and evolutionary models",
    ".    however , thermal bulges are probably not relevant to the case of gaseous ( or liquid ) planets .",
    "a perfectly rigid crust of a terrestrial planet can support any atmospheric pressure excess without being displaced sideways ( or being slightly displaced if the crust is not perfectly rigid ; see corriea & laskar 2003 ) . in the case of gaseous planets , the fluid underlying an overdense region is freely displaced sideways to attain hydrostatic equilibrium on the local sound crossing timescale .",
    "this means that any thermally driven density inhomogeneity on the top layer is almost cancelled out by the density inhomogeneity in the deeper layers . by this argument",
    ", net thermal bulges can not form on gaseous planets , and the gravitational torque acting on the thermal tide is essentially zero .    nevertheless , the oscillations of the stellar irradiation can still excite waves in gaseous planets .",
    "it is reminiscent of dynamical tides in the gravitational tide theories .",
    "waves driven by gravitational tides in hot jupiters have been studied in the literature .",
    "based on the tidal theory by @xcite for high - mass stars , @xcite suggested that the radiative layer of a hot jupiter can be tidally synchronized by the internal waves excited resonantly by the tidal force of the host star .",
    "however , in contrast to high - mass stars where the external irradiation is unimportant compared to stellar intrinsic luminosity , the stellar irradiation onto a hot jupiter is typically several orders of magnitude stronger than the intrinsic luminosity of the planet .",
    "it implies that the dynamics driven by stellar heating can not be ignored .",
    "for instance , internal waves may also be excited thermally by stellar irradiation on the top of the radiative layer of a non - synchronized hot jupiter . in addition , rotation complicates the behaviour of internal waves .",
    "@xcite studied the internal waves modified by coriolis forces ( i.e. hough waves ) in hot jupiters . in the earth s atmosphere , internal waves of the diurnal period are restricted in the region of low latitudes where the coriolis effect is small , and this explains why the thermal tide in surface air pressure is predominantly semidiurnal instead of diurnal @xcite .",
    "semi - annual oscillations in saturn s low - latitude stratospheric temperatures may be attributed to wave phenomena driven by seasonal thermal forcing @xcite . in the case of a hot jupiter that is",
    "almost tidally locked by its parent star , the thermal forcing is much slower than the coriolis effect , and will likely excite the rossby waves ( second kind of hough waves ; e.g. see longuet - higgins 1968 ) .",
    "the importance of angular momentum transport by internal and rossby waves has been discussed in the context of extrasolar giant planets ( see , e.g. , cho 2008 ) . it should be noted that while the waves driven by gravitational tidal forcing are able to exchange angular momentum between the planet and its host star , the waves driven by thermal forcing from the host star on the planet are only responsible for the angular momentum exchange between different parts of the planet , because of the cancellation of the gravitational torque described above .",
    "atmospheric circulation is an extremely complex topic which involves turbulence , winds , as well as waves and how they are thermally driven and interact .",
    "waves driven by thermal tides have never been studied analytically in the context of hot jupiters to understand their basic behaviours . therefore their roles in numerical simulations have not been easily identified . in this paper",
    ", we make a first attempt on the wave problem by considering a  clean \" picture : a diurnal thermal forcing on the radiative layer with no clouds , winds , turbulence , and gravitational tides .",
    "the radiative flux in the atmosphere is modelled using the diffusion equation with a power - law rosseland - mean opacity ( cf .",
    "dobbs - dixon & lin 2008 ) .",
    "although the variation of the stellar irradiation is not small compared to its mean value , we employ a linear analysis and investigate the possibility of wave excitation in a non - synchronized surface layer of a hot jupiter driven by stellar irradiation .",
    "the goal is to estimate how much angular momentum can be redistributed by thermal tides near the surface of a hot jupiter in our simple linear theory .",
    "we first focus on the thermal tide problem for internal waves in a non - rotating plane - parallel atmosphere in  2",
    ". then we turn our study to hough waves in a rotating atmosphere in the form of a spherical shell in  3 .",
    "finally , the results are summarized and discussed in  4 .",
    "we initially consider a non - rotating plane - parallel atmosphere with uniform gravity @xmath1 .",

    "we assume that @xmath16 and @xmath13 are constant .",

    "@xmath17 at @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the irradiating flux .",
    "the extension of the radiative diffusion approximation to the optically thin atmosphere is done for the sake of simplicity and is clearly a limitation of our model .",
    "we consider an equilibrium reference state consisting of a static atmosphere that is uniformly irradiated by the mean stellar irradiation .",
    "for the equilibrium state we have @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the intrinsic radiative flux density of the planet .",

    ", we assume that as the planet rotates , the stellar irradiation changes sinusoidally during the day and is completely switched off during the night .",

    "if the depth of the radiative layer is large enough , the internal waves can decay quickly due to radiative loss before the wave reaches the turning point where @xmath96 . therefore in these two dynamical limits",

    "when the forcing periods are short ( e.g. 0.3 and 1 day as shown in the top two panels ) , @xmath67 decays with depth and the solutions behave like those to the thermal diffusion problem with the heat diffusing from the top of the atmosphere to a depth characterized by the diffusion length @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the thermal diffusion coefficient of the atmosphere . comparing the 0.3-day to the 1-day case , figure  [ fig : t ] shows that @xmath67 can penetrate deeper in the 1-day case as a result of a longer forcing period and therefore a longer diffusion length .",
    "the phenomenon of thermal diffusion can be also verified by the phase diagram of the complex number @xmath67 .",
    "figure  [ fig : phase ] shows that in the cases of the forcing periods @xmath130 and 1 day , the solutions for @xmath67 , denoted by the solid curve in the real complex plane , spiral clockwise toward the origin as @xmath23 increases .",

    "all of these results demonstrate the process of thermal diffusion .",
    "on the other hand , when the forcing periods are long ( e.g. 10 and 100 days as shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : t ] ) , the vertical profiles of @xmath67 exhibit wavelike solutions , meaning that waves are excited from the top of the atmosphere and propagate in . these waves are known as internal waves ( i.e. g modes ) .",

    "the internal wave for the 100-day case has a much shorter wavelength and hence decays faster with depth than the wave for the 10-day case .    the different dynamics appearing in the cases of short ( thermal diffusion ) and long ( g mode ) forcing periods can be also understood by comparing the forcing period with the sound crossing time of the planet s surface . when the forcing period is longer than the sound crossing time of the planet s surface ; i.e. , @xmath141 downward - travelling internal waves ( incompressible modes ) can be driven by the diurnal forcing . on the other hand , when @xmath142 , the day - side and the night - side are causally disconnected .",

    "in the limit of solutions with very small , or zero , @xmath171 , the radial wkb approach also fails .",
    "these special solutions that are global in both @xmath194 and @xmath150 are conventionally referred to as the barotropic rossby waves , or simply the rossby waves or r modes .",

    "( [ eq : thermalforcing_plane ] ) ) .",
    "having said that the hough modes are determined from the latitude - dependent heating in our model , we should note that our description is not entirely self - consistent because we have neglected the latitudinal dependence of the average irradiation .",
    "the @xmath150-dependence of @xmath84 would lead to a latitudinal variation of the properties of the unperturbed atmosphere and would also generate winds in the basic state .",
    "these complications are in conflict with the method of separation of variables used for solving the linear problem . however , as we have explained in the preceding subsection and as we shall see from some examples later in this paper , the hough functions in some cases peak at low latitudes and decay quickly at high latitudes .",
    "moreover , the latitudinal dependence of @xmath84 , @xmath199 , is not a fast varying function of low latitudes .",
    "these imply that if we aim to perform an order - of - magnitude estimate of some wave quantities integrated over all latitudes ( such as the vertical angular momentum flux computed later in this paper ) , the contribution of calculations from high latitudes should be quite small .",
    "therefore , we may simply apply the unperturbed heating at the equator to all latitudes and expect that the error introduced from high latitudes will be diminished by the hough functions .",
    "this allows us to consider the  perturbations \" referring to time- and azimuth - dependent deviations from the symmetrically irradiated atmosphere even though the excited hough modes are still determined by the latitude - dependent perturbed heating in our model .",
    "we adopt the same input parameters for hd 209458b in the rotating case as in the plane - parallel case to solve the linear problem .",
    "we consider the diurnal thermal forcing ( @xmath85 ) and the scenario where the planet rotates faster than its orbit ( @xmath132 ) .",

    "we only consider the @xmath196th  wave \" mode ( i.e. @xmath205 ) does not necessarily admit a wave solution in the vertical direction in our problem involving thermal diffusion . ] which contributes the largest value of @xmath203 ; namely , the largest heating term in the basis of hough functions excited by the latitude - dependent diurnal forcing .",
    "this particular @xmath196 is denoted as @xmath206 .",
    "then we find that the positive eigenvalue @xmath171 associated with the leading hough mode for @xmath85 has distinct features between fast and slow thermal tides ( longuet - higgins 1968 ) .    when @xmath207 is shorter than @xmath208 days ( i.e. @xmath209 times the spin period or say @xmath210 ) , @xmath171 increases with the forcing period and is much larger than 1 .",
    "the dominant hough modes in this fast - tide regime have negative @xmath171 and are evanescent .",
    "positive and large @xmath171 are then associated with less dominant hough modes which normally consist of more weight from the associated legendre polynomials of higher degrees .",
    "for instance , @xmath171 for the forcing period @xmath130 , 1 , 3.5 , and 7 days are 37.64 , 53.9 , 135 , and 309 respectively .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath211 in the basis of the associated legendre polynomials with the normalization coefficient @xmath212/[2(l+1)!]}$ ] summed from @xmath213 up to 25 are depicted in figure  [ fig : hough_fast ] .",
    "these latitudinal structures agree roughly with the wkb analysis described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wkb_rot ] ) and ( [ eq : lambda ] ) : as the forcing period increases , the oscillatory solutions are more equatorially confined and the latitudinal wavelength becomes shorter .",
    "these waves excited by the fast thermal tides are g modes modified by rotation .",
    "when the forcing period is exactly 3 times the spin period , @xmath214 and the solution of the laplace tidal equations without thermal diffusion corresponds to a @xmath85 rossby wave with the latitudinal profile @xmath215 .",
    "when the forcing period @xmath216 3 times the spin period , other than allowing solutions with a very large positive @xmath171 ( i.e. equatorially confined g modes ) , the tidal equations also admit solutions with a small yet positive @xmath171 .",
    "they are known as the barotropic and baroclinic rossby waves .",
    "these new solutions in the slow - tide regime are the predominant modes excited by the thermal forcing in our model .",
    "the @xmath171 of the r modes increases slowly with the forcing period but remains smaller than 1 .",
    "for instance , the @xmath171 of the r modes for the forcing period @xmath217 , 50 , 100 , and 150 days are approximately 0.056 , 0.109 , 0.11 , and 0.111 respectively .",
    "the hough functions for these cases are plotted in figure  [ fig : hough_slow ] to illustrate how the latitudinal structure of these dominant modes varies with the forcing period .",
    "note that the r modes are less equatorially confined than the g modes and therefore couple better with the global heating profile ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "this explains why the r modes are more strongly excited than the g modes in our model .    knowing the eigenvalues @xmath171 and assuming the unperturbed irradiation to be spherically symmetrical",
    ", we can solve for the @xmath51-dependence of the perturbations .",
    "for comparison , we start our study with the rotating cases for the same forcing periods considered in the non - rotating cases : 0.3 , 1 , 10 , and 100 days . the results for the temperature perturbations are shown in figure [ fig : t_pert_rot ] ( rotating cases ) for comparison with figure [ fig : t ] ( non - rotating plane - parallel cases ) . in the 0.3-day case , the solutions for both the rotating and non - rotating cases exhibit diffusive behaviour . in the 100-day case ,",
    "the waves propagate downwards in the rotating case as in the non - rotating case but the vertical wavelength in the rotating cases is longer ( therefore the waves are less damped via radiative loss ) because @xmath171 has a small value .",
    "however in the 1-day and 10-day cases , the coriolis effect introduces a large and a small @xmath171 respectively , turning the diffusive solution to a wave solution in the 1-day case and turning the wave solution to a diffusive solution in the 10-day case .",
    "although the leading modes in the 0.3- and 10-day cases give rise to vertically diffusive solutions , the less dominant modes ( with therefore smaller magnitudes ) , do admit vertical wave solutions due to the much larger values of @xmath171 .",
    "these are g modes and more equatorially confined .",
    "for instance , we find that ( not plotted here ) the second dominant mode in the 10-day case gives a vertical wave solution ( g mode ) because @xmath219 but its wave magnitude , described by @xmath203 , is 0.024 which is much smaller than the magnitude @xmath220 of the most dominant mode .",
    "the hough function in the 10-day case has a latitudinal profile close to @xmath221 , more akin to the barotropic rossby mode . on the other hand , the dominant modes for the forcing period @xmath222 days",
    "do give vertical wave solutions .",
    "as the planet is more rotationally synchronized ( i.e. , @xmath223 becomes smaller and therefore @xmath224 becomes larger ) ,",
    "the rossby waves are more akin to baroclinic r modes with shorter vertical wavelength ( see the 100-day case in figure  [ fig : t_pert_rot ] ) and are more equatorially confined .",
    "note that although the r mode in the 10-day case decays vertically due to thermal diffusion , it has a broad distribution across latitudes .",
    "therefore the assumption of symmetrical unperturbed irradiation relying on small values of hough functions at high latitudes may not be appropriate in this case .    in the regime of fast thermal tides ( @xmath225 )",
    ", only g modes can exist . in the 1-day case",
    ", we have applied the bottom boundary conditions @xmath100 at @xmath226 to illustrate the results ( see figure  [ fig : t_pert_rot ] ) because we have difficulty obtaining the solutions when imposing the bottom boundary conditions at @xmath41 .",
    "this may result from the possibility that the wave of long vertical wavelength in the 1-day case can penetrate deep into the radiative layer , rendering the bottom boundary conditions @xmath100 invalid ( cf .",
    "the 10-day case in the non - rotating case ) . to justify this approach for the 1-day case",
    ", we examine the solutions for forcing periods slightly longer than 1 day , with the expectation that short - wave solutions would appear owing to the larger @xmath171 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : t_pert_rot2 ] for the cases of @xmath227 days ( @xmath228 ) and @xmath229 days ( @xmath230 ) .",
    "as the forcing period increases from 1 day to 3.5 days , and then to 7 days , the wave solutions can be seen clearly with decreasing vertical wavelength , as expected .",
    "the larger values of @xmath171 associated with the less dominant hough modes manifest themselves as shorter latitudinal wavelength as a result of the coriolis effect , driving internal waves of shorter vertical wavelength according to the wkb dispersion relation ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wkb_rot ] ) and ( [ eq : lambda ] ) ) .",
    "= 17 cm    in summary , the diurnal thermal forcing in the rotating case excites a series of hough modes .",
    "when the forcing period is long ( i.e. , @xmath207 is much longer than @xmath231 days ) , the dominant modes are baroclinic rossby waves that can propagate downwards .",
    "when the forcing period is short ( i.e. , @xmath207 is shorter than @xmath231 days ) , the dominant modes are evanescent due to either the coriolis effect ( i.e. negative @xmath171 ) or thermal diffusion .",
    "however , the less dominant modes have short latitudinal wavelength and therefore internal waves can be excited without being subject to the same constraint that the sound crossing time between the day and night sides needs to be shorter than the forcing period as in the non - rotating plane - parallel case .",
    "since the less dominant modes are small in magnitude , we expect that the angular momentum transported by the fast tides ( g modes ) is smaller than in the case of the slow tides ( r modes ) .",
    "this is the subject of the next subsection .",
    "the vertical angular momentum flux carried by the hough waves integrated over the planet s surface is given by @xcite @xmath232 r_p^2\\sin\\theta d\\theta,\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath233 are both expressed as series of hough functions ( @xmath234 , etc . ) in our model .",
    "then the total flux is the sum of the contributions from each hough function , because they are orthogonal .",

    "we focus only on @xmath238 due to the leading hough mode ( i.e. , @xmath239 ) and use the peak value of the radial profile of the angular momentum flux to quantify the torque in each case of parameter study .",
    "since our calculation is limited to a thin radiative layer and by the condition of symmetrical unperturbed irradiation , to reasonably estimate @xmath240 , we focus on the frequency regimes in which the solutions give short vertical wavelengths and modest equatorial confinement . hence we carry out the estimates for the following forcing periods : 3.5 , 7 , 100 , & 150 days .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ table ] , taking into consideration 4 different cases for each forcing period ; case i : the original case for the input parameters of hd 209458b , case ii : the same input parameters as case i except that a larger @xmath12 ( @xmath33 is increased by a factor of 100 ) is used , case iii : the same as case i except that a larger @xmath89 ( @xmath241 , a young planet ) is used , and case iv : the same as case i except that a smaller @xmath31 ( one half of @xmath242 au ) is used .",
    "note that changing @xmath12 , @xmath89 , or @xmath31 would alter the interior structure and therefore other input parameters such as @xmath22 need to change accordingly .",

    "[ table ] shows that the torques in the fast - tide cases ( i.e. 3.5 and 7 days ) are weaker than those in the slow - tide cases ( i.e. 100 and 150 days ) by several orders of magnitude .",
    "as described in the previous subsection , this is primarily because the dominant hough modes in the fast - tide regime are evanescent in the vertical direction .",
    "more specifically , the amplitudes of the internal waves @xmath243 are 0.08 for @xmath244 days and 0.04 for @xmath245 days , which are smaller than the amplitudes of the baroclinic rossby waves 0.88 for @xmath246 days and 0.82 for @xmath247 days .",
    "table  [ table ] also illustrates how different input parameters affect the torque @xmath240 driven by the thermal tides .",
    "case ii shows that increasing @xmath33 by 2 orders of magnitude only reduces the torque by less than a factor of 3 , indicating that the result is less sensitive to the opacity .",
    "case iii shows that the torque driven by fast ( i.e. , 3.5 and 7 days ) thermal tides on a larger hot jupiter is weaker than that on a smaller hot jupiter .",
    "the effect is opposite for slow ( i.e. , 100 and 150 days ) thermal tides .",
    "case iv shows that placing a hot jupiter closer to its parent star decreases ( increases ) the torque in the fast ( slow ) tide case .",
    "note that increasing @xmath12 , @xmath89 ( therefore @xmath52 ) , or @xmath84 reduces the pressure and density of the equilibrium state at a given @xmath23 .",
    "this normally leads to an increase in @xmath233 but does not dictate the change of @xmath66 in any unique way among the various cases .",
    "therefore , the torque does not follow a simple trend in variation with any of the input parameters .",

    "this implies that in our calculation , thermal tides play a significant role in transferring angular momentum to the atmospheric gas even if contributions of the gravitational tides are also a factor in the atmosphere .",
    "we present a linear perturbation analysis for internal waves excited by the stellar diurnal thermal forcing ( @xmath85 thermal tides ) in a non - synchronized radiative layer of a hot jupiter . for computational simplicity",
    ", we employ the radiative diffusion approximation with a power - law opacity throughout our computation region from the radiative layer to a cloud - free atmosphere and apply the marshak boundary condition for energy balance at @xmath18 .",

    "the boundary conditions at the bottom of the radiative layer are set to be @xmath100 which we speculate are less accurate for the waves with long vertical wavelength .",
    "nevertheless , we find that when the thermal forcing period is shorter than the sound speed crossing time between the day and the night sides of the planet , the periodic thermal heating at the top of the atmosphere diffuses into a deeper layer with a decay length related to @xmath56 . in the fast thermal",
    "forcing regime corresponding to the rotation rate of our jupiter , the problem for an atmosphere heated by the stellar irradiation becomes essentially a 1-d thermal diffusion problem with @xmath253 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the thermal forcing period is longer than the sound crossing time of the planet s surface , the day and the night sides are causally connected and the problem becomes a 2-d phenomenon with incompressible properties . as a result , the internal waves are excited at the top of the atmosphere before propagating downwards .",
    "when the planet spins faster ( slower ) than its orbital motion , the thermal tides exhibit a retrograde ( prograde ) motion .",
    "the retrograde ( prograde ) waves causes the upward ( downward ) transport of momentum .",
    "the radiative damping of the waves leads to the deposition of the momentum in the atmosphere .",
    "we then carry out a linear calculation for a thin spherical shell which rotates at a uniform angular speed .",
    "since @xmath254 , we adopt the traditional approximation and neglect inertial terms in the vertical momentum equation . we also assume a spherically symmetrically irradiated atmosphere as the basic state .",
    "these assumptions allow us to separate the variables and obtain the perturbation of the form re@xmath255 $ ] .",
    "we examine the diurnal thermal forcing @xmath85 and consider the @xmath196th component of the hough function which contributes the dominant latitudinal structure of the heating .",
    "the linearized odes thus remain the same as those in the plane - parallel case except that the horizontal wavenumber @xmath54 is replaced by the eigenvalue @xmath256 . in other words",
    ", @xmath171 conceals the information on how the latitudinal structure is modified by the coriolis effect .",
    "similar to the non - rotating plane - parallel case , the internal waves are driven by thermal forcing at the top of the rotating atmosphere .",

    "when the planet spins faster than its orbit ( @xmath122 ) , these waves propagate inwards but transport angular momentum outwards . while the torque generated by the radiative damping of the baroclinic rossby waves in the slow - tide regime is comparable to the torque due to the gravitational tides , the torque generated by internal waves in the fast - tide regime ( i.e. , @xmath257 is shorter than @xmath231 days ) is smaller by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the magnitude of the torque is more sensitive to @xmath89 and @xmath31 than @xmath12 in our model . unlike the thermal tide theories for a dense atmosphere on a terrestrial planet @xcite",
    ", our model for hot jupiters , which do not have a hard surface , fails to generate net thermal bulges and therefore causes only internal transport of angular momentum inside the planet .",
    "in fact , the atmosphere in our model brings the interior closer to , not further away from , synchronous rotation .",
    "together with the gravitational tides , one possible equilibrium state for rotation in our scenario is still the synchronous rotation . at this point , it is not clear how our linear results without winds for a non - synchronized hot jupiter are able to explain the vertical shear appearing in existing 3-dimensional numerical simulations for the atmospheres of hot jupiters .",
    "apparently , the advection in the upper atmosphere of a hot jupiter is driven by the temperature gradient between the day and night sides and can not be described by our linear approach .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that the wave dynamics plays a role in the lower atmosphere where the day - night temperature contrast is small .",
