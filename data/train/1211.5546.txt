    "the artery is modeled as an axially symmetric elastic tube , with cross section @xmath33 which depends on the axial coordinate @xmath34 and time @xmath35 being elastic , the artery experiences a restoring force when expanded from it s equilibrium cross - section , and as such exerts additional pressure on the blood contained within .",
    "the volume of blood contained in the infinitesimal volume of artery between the axial locations @xmath34 and @xmath36 , at a fixed instant @xmath37 is @xmath38 in addition , the mass content in that same volume of blood will be the material density at the location at that instant @xmath39 , times the volume itself , or @xmath40 the sub - script @xmath41 on @xmath42 denotes the mass of the blood at a fixed instant @xmath37 . since we model the blood as an incompressible fluid , the density of the blood is homogenous throughout the artery at all instants , and so in our model the blood density is a fixed constant @xmath43 within a finite volume of artery , between the axial locations @xmath44 and @xmath34 , with @xmath45 and at some fixed moment @xmath46 it follows that the mass content is , @xmath47 the sub - script appearing in @xmath48 denotes the volume between the axial locations @xmath44 and @xmath49    the velocity of the blood through the artery at a fixed axial coordinate and time will be uniform throughout the cross - section at that location and time . in an infinitesimal time element @xmath50",
    "the blood content at the location @xmath34 will be displaced by a distance @xmath51 in this time interval , the total mass of blood to traverse the cross - section @xmath33 will be @xmath52 it follows that the change in the blood content in the arterial volume between @xmath44 and @xmath53 in the time interval @xmath50 is the total blood displacement into the volume across @xmath54 less the total blood displacement out of the volume across @xmath55 so we may write , @xmath56 no subscript appears on the mass element @xmath57 on the left hand side above , since we are evaluating the change in mass content over the infinitesimal time interval @xmath58    we may rewrite the above equation as one involving the rate of change of blood content within a finite arterial volume as follows , @xmath59 operating on this equation with @xmath60 the fundamental theorem of calculus applied to the left - hand side gives us @xmath61 while @xmath62 applied to the right hand side gives us @xmath63 thus we arrive at the continuity equation , @xmath64 where sub - scripts denote partial differentiation with respect to the particular variable .",

    "@xmath50 the infinitesimal increase ( decrease ) in the blood content @xmath57 at @xmath34 causes an increase ( decrease ) of the blood volume , since the blood itself is incompressible .",
    "as the walls of the artery are elastic , this increase ( decrease ) in blood volume is accommodated by an expansion ( contraction ) of the artery , which is realised as an increase ( decrease ) in its cross section @xmath66 at the location @xmath49    newton s laws dictate that any forces acting upon the blood will cause a corresponding change of momentum of the blood . in the case of fluids ,",
    "the forces acting upon any individual element may be separated into two categories    * the external forces acting on the fluid elements , which in this case will be the restoring forces present in the artery walls , thereby exerting an external pressure on the blood at a given location @xmath34 and some instant @xmath35 * the internal forces acting upon a fluid element caused by contiguous fluid elements .",
    "both external and internal forces are found to cause an overall change in the linear momentum of an individual fluid element , in accordance with newton s second law .",
    "the linear momentum of an infinitesimal volume of blood at some location @xmath34 and instant @xmath37 is @xmath67 or the infinitesimal mass element times the velocity thereof . the time rate of change of the momentum , namely @xmath68 will appear as the left hand side of newton s second law . in the case of a finite volume of blood",
    "this becomes @xmath69 which is the rate of change in momentum of the blood contained within the artery between @xmath44 and @xmath34 at the instant @xmath35 as we have already seen , an infinitesimal time displacement causes a corresponding spatial displacement of the blood at @xmath53 by an amount @xmath70 however , in moving this distance the velocity of that blood will change by the amount @xmath71 it follows that the corresponding change in linear momentum of this blood will be it mass times the change in velocity , or @xmath72 which for a finite volume becomes @xmath73 thus we have established the change in linear momentum of a finite volume of blood , due to the spatial displacement thereof , during an infinitesimal time increment @xmath58    next we must also include the possibility that the linear momentum of the blood will change in an infinitesimal time @xmath50 due to a change in the blood - content .",
    "suppose at some instant @xmath37 the rate of increase of blood at @xmath34 is @xmath74 while the rate of decrease of blood at @xmath36 is @xmath75 it follows that the rate of change of the mass will be @xmath76 and the corresponding rate of change of the linear momentum will be @xmath77 in the case of a finite volume , the corresponding change in linear momentum is , @xmath78 this concludes the effect of internal forces acting upon an individual fluid element within the artery .",
    "next we need to investigate the effects of external forces on a fluid element . in this case",
    "the external forces are provided by the restoring forces within the arterial wall itself , which exerts a force on the blood . between the axial locations @xmath34 and @xmath79 the internal surface of the artery has a directed area element @xmath80 with @xmath81 being the outward normal and @xmath82 being the magnitude of the infinitesimal area element .",
    "the force exerted by the tube on the blood is @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the pressure exerted due to the restoring force of the artery acting on the blood . in the case of a finite volume @xmath85 between @xmath44 and @xmath53",
    "we find the corresponding force exerted by the artery with surface area @xmath86 to be @xmath87 applying gauss law this may be re - written as @xmath88 this accounts for all the forces acting on the blood contained within the artery between axial locations @xmath44 and @xmath49    having established the rate of change of momentum , along with the various contributing forces , we require an equation of motion for this finite fluid element . on applying newton s second law to the above acceleration and forces , we obtain , @xmath89d\\xi - \\int_{a}^{x}\\partial_{\\xi}p(\\xi , t)a(\\xi , t)d\\xi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] dividing both sides by @xmath65 operating on the resulting equation with @xmath60 and applying the fundamental theorem of calculus to both sides we obtain , @xmath90 expanding the derivatives on each side , applying the continuity equation ( [ gov.1 ] ) , and dividing by @xmath66 we find @xmath91 we see that in our model the blood flow will satisfy _ euler s equation _ for an incompressible , inviscid and irrotational fluid .    in general it is difficult to obtain from first principles an explicit expression for the transmural pressure @xmath92 however a large body of experimental data exists to suggest a plausible correspondence between the pressure and the cross section of the tube itself . indeed , a standard example is the so called _ windkessel _ model @xcite , in which the pressure is related linearly to the cross - section , @xmath93 the constant @xmath94 relates the elastic restoring force of the tube when distended to cross - section @xmath66 to the pressure exerted on the blood .",
    "this is generally determined from clinical data . in this paper",
    "we will adopt a slightly more complicated model , whereby the relationship between pressure and aortic cross - section is quadratic , namely @xmath95 again , the constant @xmath96 in our model is determined from clinical data , however it shall play no significant role in any of the remaining results . as such , we shall redefine our cross - section , such that @xmath97 finally the second governing equation of our model for arterial blood flow is , @xmath98 the equations ( [ gov.1 ] ) and ( [ gov.2 ] ) when taken together constitute a two - component dispersionless burgers equation .",
