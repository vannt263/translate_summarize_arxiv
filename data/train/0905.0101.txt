    "<S> we present evidence for the first observation of electromagnetically bound @xmath0-pairs ( @xmath1-atoms ) with the dirac experiment at the cern - ps . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-atoms are produced by the 24 gev / c proton beam in a thin pt - target and the @xmath2 and @xmath3-mesons from the atom dissociation are analyzed in a two - arm magnetic spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> the observed enhancement at low relative momentum corresponds to the production of 173 @xmath4 54 @xmath1-atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the mean life of @xmath1-atoms is related to the @xmath5-wave @xmath1-scattering lengths , the measurement of which is the goal of the experiment . from these first data we derive a lower limit for the mean life of 0.8 fs at 90% confidence level .    ,    </S>",
