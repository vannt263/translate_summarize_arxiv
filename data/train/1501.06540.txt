    "the universe is currently experiencing an epoch of accelerated expansion . during the last fifteen years , since it was first suggested by type - ia supernovae surveys @xcite , this important conclusion has been confirmed by cosmological observations of ever increasing precision , which includes measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , the hubble constant @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite and again type - ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , despite all these inputs from astronomical observations , on the theoretical ground we still lack a fully satisfactory explanation of this phenomenon . the standard cosmological model , the simplest model capable of fitting all the present observational data , assumes the existence of both a non - vanishing cosmological constant and a cold dark matter component .",
    "the former is introduced to produce the required accelerated expansion at late times , while the latter is postulated in order to increase the amount of structure formation needed to be in agreement with observed cosmological structures at both large and small scales .",
    "the cosmological constant , however , suffers from some profound theoretical issues arising from its extremely small measured value if compared with predicted values by ( quantum ) field theoretical considerations ; see @xcite for a recent review .    in order to solve these issues , or at least to alleviate them",
    ", it has been proposed that the current cosmological acceleration might be due to the effect of some dynamical field , mimicking the properties of a cosmological constant at late times . to agree with current observations",
    "such new component must be invisible to electro - magnetic radiation , which is the reason why it has been called dark energy , in analogy with dark matter .",
    "the fact that both dark matter and dark energy can not be detected through the visible sector could imply new interesting phenomenology .",
    "in fact , as long as we are unable to probe these dark components but through their gravitational effects , one can not exclude the possibility of non - gravitational interactions between them . following this reasoning ,",
    "one is thus naturally led to consider cosmological theories where interactions are possible .",
    "note however that if both dark matter and dark energy can be measured solely by their gravitational influence , then the physical consequences of their interaction might be observationally indistinguishable from similar effects arising in other cosmological models without interaction , as for example in modified gravity and warm dark matter models @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it is important to study different interacting dark energy models not only to search for new interesting phenomenological features , but also to support the observational efforts to focus on possible distinctive signatures of such models ; a tentative review on these models has recently been proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest dynamical models of dark energy identify this mysterious component with a minimally coupled canonical scalar field @xmath0 .",
    "dark energy theories of this kind are generally known by the name of quintessence and are quite popular in the literature because they are sufficiently simple to handle and sufficiently complicated to produce non - trivial dynamics ; for reviews see e.g.  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the cosmological evolution of ( cold ) dark matter is usually described by a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath1 and vanishing pressure @xmath2 .",
    "simple models of interacting dark energy can thus be constructed by coupling the scalar field @xmath0 to the energy density @xmath1 of the dark matter fluid .",
    "such a coupling is usually introduced at the level of the cosmological field equations adding a term mixing the quintessence and dark matter equations of motion .",
    "specifically in the presence of a general coupling between the two dark components , the background cosmological equations are commonly expressed as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hubble rate , @xmath5 the energy density of quintessence , @xmath6 its pressure and @xmath7 .",
    "we set @xmath8 .",
    "an over - dot denotes differentiation with respect to cosmological time and the variable @xmath9 quantifies the rate of energy exchanged in the dark sector and generally depends on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( and possibly their time derivatives ) .",
    "if @xmath10 the energy flows from dark matter to quintessence , while if @xmath11 the energy transfer is in the opposite direction .",
    "the dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath1 of @xmath9 is a phenomenological assumption which , together with the form of the scalar field potential , determines the interacting quintessence model at hand . throughout the last fifteen years",
    "an impressive amount of possible choices has been studied , the most common being @xmath12 , which can easily be motivated in the einstein frame formulation of scalar - tensor theories @xcite .",
    "we can not discuss in detail this vast amount of literature and the interested reader is referred to @xcite and in the references therein which provides a general overview of this subject ( see also @xcite for some recent works ) .    in the present paper we will consider a new approach to build models of quintessence interacting with dark matter .",
    "the coupling will not be added at the level of the cosmological field equations as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : standard_coupling ] ) , but it will be directly introduced into an action characterising both quintessence and dark matter . variations with respect to the scalar field @xmath0 and the matter degrees of freedom will then provide the coupled equations of motion of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "we will assume that dark matter can still effectively be characterised by a perfect fluid with vanishing pressure even at the lagrangian level .",
    "this implies that a lagrangian description for perfect fluids must be adopted in order not only to obtain the correct expression for the dark matter energy - momentum tensor , but also to define its coupling to the quintessence field .",
    "there are different lagrangian approaches to perfect fluids that have been developed during the years ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite have recently considered a lagrangian approach to a scalar field coupled to a fluid based on the so - called pull - back formalism  @xcite . in this framework",
    "they constructed three new models of interacting dark energy with completely new features with respect to the models defined by the standard coupling of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : standard_coupling ] ) .",
    "subsequently they analysed their impact on the cosmological observables showing new interesting phenomenology capable of being tested against observational data .",
    "the same approach has also been used to study theories of interacting cosmological fluids in the context of effective field theories @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will develop the lagrangian formulation of quintessence coupled to the dark matter fluid . instead of using the pull - back formalism",
    ", we will employ the framework with lagrangian multipliers outlined by brown in @xcite , which is easier to handle and will lead to new phenomenology at both solar system and cosmological scales .",
    "our philosophy will be to fully embrace the variational methods of @xcite and in particular we will discuss the most general actions that one can build out of all the dynamical degrees of freedom associated with the matter fluid .",
    "a similar approach has already been studied for dark matter non - minimally coupled to gravity where the fluid 4-velocity is coupled to the ricci tensor and the fluid energy density to the ricci scalar @xcite . here",
    "however we will not modify the gravitational sector , which will be described by standard general relativity , but we will limit the interaction of the matter fluid with the quintessence field .",
    "the couplings obtained in this way will first be applied to describe the phenomenology of dark energy at small scales , where models presenting environment dependent interactions will be able to efficiently screen any scalar field effect and thus to satisfy all solar system constraints . then the background cosmology obtained within this framework will be studied and the dynamics of different interacting quintessence models will be analysed in depth .    the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",

    "( [ 020 ] ) and ( [ eq : geodesic_standard ] ) one realises that the interaction between the scalar field and the matter fluid gives rise to a fifth force @xmath96 .",
    "thus , as one could expect , the motion of the matter fluid is non - geodesic due to the presence of the extra force @xmath97 which in general depends on both @xmath21 and @xmath0 .",
    "note however that if @xmath96 does not depend on either @xmath0 or @xmath21 then it vanishes completely , reflecting the fact that there is no effective interaction in such cases . furthermore , according to the definition of 4-force in relativistic theories , @xmath97 is always orthogonal to the fluid 4-velocity : @xmath98",
    ".    the appearance of this fifth force can give rise to interesting phenomenology at both solar system and galactic scales .",
    "for example the non - geodesic motion of luminous matter can be used as an alternative to dark matter in explaining the anomalies observed in the galaxy rotation curves .",
    "the situation here is similar to the one arising from non - minimally coupled theories @xcite , where an extra force depending on the local curvature produces effects similar to the ones predicted by mond theories @xcite . in mond theories",
    "however the modification of newtonian mechanics at galactic distances depends on an effective acceleration @xmath99 ( or equivalently on an effective length @xmath100 ) which is usually assumed to be constant and thus difficult to adapt to different galaxy profiles . in non -",
    "minimally coupled theories such effective acceleration depends on the small value of the local gravitational curvature as well as on the matter energy density of the environment .",
    "this might help in fitting the rotational velocity curves of several galaxies within a single model where @xmath99 varies from one galaxy to the other .",
    "exactly the same argument applies to the scalar field interacting model considered here . from the fifth force ( [ 020 ] ) it is in fact possible to define an effective acceleration @xmath101 which modifies the newtonian equations at galactic distances in exactly the same way as @xmath99 does .",
    "the difference resides in the fact that @xmath101 depends on the scalar field @xmath0 rather than on the local curvature and thus might predict quite different results even for galaxies having roughly the same matter density distribution .    at",
    "solar system scales the fifth force ( [ 020 ] ) is highly constrained by the experiments which do not show any violation on the inverse - square newtonian law up to parts in @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "the effects of the interaction between the scalar field and the matter fluid must then be negligible at those distances .",
    "fortunately , as we are now going to see , the dependence of the fifth force on the fluid dynamical degrees of freedom allows us to build efficient screening of possible deviations from the geodesic motion .      from the klein - gordon equation ( [ 018 ] ) one can realise that the scalar field @xmath0 `` feels '' an effective potential given by @xmath103 which can be used to screen the interaction between the scalar field and matter at solar system scales .",
    "the effective potential ( [ 037 ] ) represents in fact a generalisation of the so called chameleon theories where the scalar field couples to the matter energy density and acquire an effective mass characterised by the surrounding environment @xcite . to show this we can consider an interacting term defined by @xmath104 where @xmath1 is the matter energy density and @xmath105 is a function of @xmath0 . with this choice",
    "the interacting energy density and pressure ( [ 024 ] ) read @xmath106 next we assume the scalar field potential to be of the `` runaway kind '' , i.e.  to satisfy @xmath107 such constraints are usually imposed on the scalar field potential in order to obtain a late time cosmic speed - up such as , for example , in the well - known inverse power law potential @xcite @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a constant with mass units and @xmath110 a positive parameter .",
    "if we now set @xmath111 with @xmath112 and @xmath113 positive constants , we obtain the effective potential @xmath114 which coincides with the single matter chameleon potential of @xcite .",
    "of course if we considered more than one matter fluid we would have ended up with exactly the multi - component equation considered in @xcite , however for our scopes a discussion with one matter fluid is enough .",
    "the fact that the @xmath115 has a minimum for solar system values of @xmath1 implies that at those distances the scalar field acquires an effective mass .",
    "if this mass is sufficiently high , then all possible interactions with particles of the standard model are efficiently suppressed . at cosmological scales",
    "though , where the matter energy density is extremely low , the effective potential ( [ 038 ] ) reduces simply to @xmath116 which , given the assumptions ( [ 039 ] ) and ( [ 040 ] ) , can thus drive the late time acceleration of the universe ; see @xcite for more details .    from these considerations",
    "we have seen that the formulation developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : algebraic_formulation ] , with the assumption @xmath117 , can be used to derive chameleon field theories from a lagrangian approach .",
    "moreover if other interacting terms @xmath65 are considered , the same formulation can also be adopted to build more general screening mechanisms for the scalar field .",
    "in fact as long as the effective potential ( [ 037 ] ) posses a minimum for solar system values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 then the scalar field will always appear with a non - zero mass at those scales , which , if large enough , will allow the scalar field to pass all solar system tests .",
    "of course , in order to properly check its viability , any such model should undergo an analysis similar to the one performed for the original chameleon theories of @xcite .",
    "a deeper analysis of the possible screening mechanisms that can be obtained with different choices of the interacting term @xmath65 will be left for future studies . here , in order to present some of the potentialities that derive from our approach , we will limit the discussion on few considerations regarding a particular model .",
    "first we will assume the function @xmath65 to depend on @xmath21 and @xmath22 only through @xmath20 .",
    "this reduces the space of possible new models , but allows for an immediate physical interpretation and the analysis can be better compared with the standard chameleon paradigm as given by eq .",

    "for the particular model we will consider here , we will take a scalar field with vanishing self - interaction , i.e.  with @xmath118 . without a coupling to the matter sector such massless scalar field could never accelerate the late time expansion of the universe and thus it would never constitute a viable dark energy model .",

    "it is therefore natural to define the matrix of first derivatives @xmath183 which is the familiar jacobian matrix of vector calculus ( not to be confused with the current @xmath29 ) .",
    "the information on stability is contained in the eigenvalues of this matrix @xmath184 evaluated at the critical point @xmath178 . since @xmath184 is a @xmath185 matrix , it will have three , not necessarily distinct , eigenvalues .",
    "if all eigenvalues of @xmath184 are positive , we speak of an unstable point since all perturbations would grow exponentially . on the other hand ,",
    "if all eigenvalues are negative this point would be regarded stable .",
    "if at some fixed point the matrix @xmath184 contains positive and negative eigenvalues , then one speaks of a saddle point .",
    "one could also encounter a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues and one additional real eigenvalue . in this case ,",
    "stability and instability will depend on the signs of the real parts of the eigenvalues .",
    "linear stability theory breaks down when at least one of the eigenvalues has a zero real part . in this case one",

    "this would clarify the issues of structure formation and stability , both of which are quite challenging to address in general interacting dark energy models .",

    "<S> the resulting gravitational field equations are derived by variations with respect to the independent variables . </S>",
    "<S> new interesting phenomenology can be obtained at both small scales , where new screening mechanisms for scalar fields can be realized , and large scales , where one finds an original and rich class of interacting quintessence models . </S>",
    "<S> the background cosmology of two of these models is studied in detail using dynamical system techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we find a variety of interesting results : for instance , these models contain dark energy dominated late time attractors and scaling solutions , both with early time matter dominated epochs and a possible inflationary origin . in general this new approach provides the starting point for future in depth studies on new interacting quintessence models . </S>"
