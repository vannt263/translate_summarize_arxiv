    "a basic problem in the study of free surfaces instabilities is the breakup of a flat thin liquid film on a solid substrate . up to now , the description based on the hydrodynamic and deterministic navier ",
    "stokes equations are proven to be valid even down to the nanometric scale  @xcite .",
    "this has been accomplished by introducing the intermolecular interaction between the liquid and the substrate .",
    "however , it is known that at these scales the thermal agitation of molecules is relevant when describing the behavior of matter  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is still necessary to investigate what role can play the thermal fluctuations in the hydrodynamic description of these instabilities .",
    "the consequences derived from considering this other effect can be of interest when designing microfluidic devices or electronic components whose function relies on thin film properties .",
    "in particular , we are interested on the effects that thermal noise may cause on films laterally much larger ( up to microns ) than their thicknesses",
    ".    the study of the effects of thermal noise in the hydrodynamical equations was first introduced phenomenologically many years ago by landau  @xcite and uhlenbeck  @xcite .",
    "this inclusion can be done from the deterministic boltzmann equation by a long - wave approximation , which justifies its microscopic feature .",
    "these equations have been used in the study of turbulence in randomly stirred fluids  @xcite , the onset of instabilities in rayleigh ",
    "benard convection  @xcite and taylor  couette flow  @xcite .",
    "this subject is of interest nowadays because one of the issues to be considered in the discussions about the differences between navier  stokes equation and molecular dynamics simulations is the effect of thermally triggered fluctuations in the classical hydrodynamic continuum modeling .",
    "in particular , the application to unstable polymeric thin films has been the object of several theoretical and experimental studies  @xcite . in this problem",
    ", stochasticity has been analyzed using several techniques ( such as minkowsky invariants  @xcite ) to contrast some theoretical predictions with experimental results  @xcite , where stochasticity is mostly considered as a spatial white noise .",
    "on the other hand , the problem of unstable liquid metal films with thermal noise has not been object of such a thorough study . in this problem ,",
    "the solid coating is melted by laser , and this introduces aspects that require the consideration of new factors such as the spatial correlation . since the deposition of energy is not strictly uniform throughout the illuminated spot , the liquid lifetimes of different regions are not the same . in this context",
    ", there is a mix of factors to be considered when looking at samples from different regions .",
    "in fact , the time evolution of the sample at a certain region , due to the corresponding liquid lifetime , is compounded with the possibility that the laser illumination induces thermal fluctuations that might not be the same for all regions .",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is to consider how different spatial correlations of the ensuing fluctuations could influence the final spectra of the unstable modes .    in this work",
    "we study the thin film instability by using a stochastic version of the thin - film equation based on the lubrication approximation for incompressible hydrodynamic equations ( see section  [ sec : tf_stoch ] ) .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : lsa ] we perform the linear stability analysis of the thin film under the perturbation with normal modes , and in section  [ sec : num ] we solve numerically the stochastic thin - film equation , and compare the results with the linear solution obtained previously .",
    "a comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental fourier spectra obtained from sem images of the instability of a melted copper film is presented in section  [ sec : exp ] , and finally we summarize and discuss the results in section  [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "in the framework of the continuous mechanics , the thermal agitation of the film molecules modifies the surface forces which describe the interaction between the fluid inside a volume element and its surroundings .",
    "thus , an additional term , @xmath1 , in the expression of the newtonian stress tensor has to be considered in order to include somehow the effect of molecular thermal motion  @xcite . within the lubrication approximation ,",
    "the most relevant component of @xmath1 is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 can be either @xmath4 or @xmath5 and indicates a direction parallel to the substrate while @xmath6 stands for the normal one . due to its randomness",
    ", @xmath2 has zero mean @xmath7 and the correlator is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the fluid viscosity , and @xmath11 . here ,",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are the boltzmann constant and fluid temperature , respectively .",
    "this property is a consequence of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem of the statistical mechanics , which relates the fluctuations of physical quantifies to the dissipative properties of the system . from a physical point of view , the hydrodynamical equations are only valid at a scale large as compared to the molecular scale . strictly speaking , since thermodynamic equilibrium is characterized by a gaussian velocity spatial distribution , uncorrelated noise is required .",
    "therefore , the correlation function @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr_s ] ) must have a small width .",
    "in the same approximation , the pressure terms in the isotropic part of the stress for a film of local thickness @xmath15 are given , as usually , by the capillary pressure , @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the surface tension ) , and the disjoining - conjoining pressure ( van der waals force ) , @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the reduction of the navier ",
    "stokes equations under the lubrication approximation leads to  @xcite : @xmath19    - { \\vec \\nabla } \\cdot \\left [ \\int_0^h ( h - z ) { \\cal s}_{||z}(z ) dz\\right]=0 , \\label{eq : h_s}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 .",

    "( [ eq : h_s ] ) enters as a rather complicated integral .",
    "it sums up @xmath6-uncorrelated noise terms over the film thickness , but it has the advantage that it maintains the conservative form of the equation .",

    "our experimental data correspond to copper thin films of a few nanometers thick that are melted by the illumination with pulses of an excimer laser that last some tens of nanoseconds . during these pulses ,",

    "the liquid lifetime of the melted copper is related with the local temperature of the film , i.e. with the spatial distribution of the laser intensity , which spans in a radially symmetric gaussian profile .",
    "after the pulse , the metal solidifies leaving a distinct pattern of holes , drops and/or ridges depending on how long the metal has been in the liquid state .",
    "more information about this setup configuration and details on the technique can be found elsewhere  @xcite .    since the outer regions of the laser spot have shorter liquid lifetimes , one can associate these regions with earlier times of the evolution , and consequently , central regions with later times .",
    "since the laser spot is relatively large , the sem images of these experiments have the advantage of offering more spatial information than other setups  @xcite . nevertheless , they have the drawback that the times corresponding to every stage of the evolution are unknown , even if it is possible to order the time sequence in connection with the distance of the image respect to the center of the laser spot  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the following comparison is to show that the experimental observations represented by the spectra require not only a stochastic temporal evolution , but also some spatial correlation in the thermal noise in order to reproduce the full results .",
    "in particular , we will concentrate here on the data reported in  @xcite , where the sem images of the evolving melted metal were analyzed by using bidimensional ( 2d ) discrete fourier transform ( dft ) . since , the 2d spectra turned out to be radially symmetric in the wavenumber space , @xmath203 , the results in fig .",
    "5 of @xcite were reported as amplitudes @xmath204 , versus @xmath205 .",
    "these amplitudes were in fact averaged on circles of radius @xmath125 , and therefore the corresponding 1d amplitude is obtained as @xmath206 ( see symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : sexp ] ) .",
    "the symbols for both small @xmath125 and amplitudes ( @xmath207 ) are an artifact of the finite length of the sample in the fourier calculation .",
    "the parameters for liquid copper are @xmath208 , and @xmath209 . assuming @xmath210 as a typical temperature of the film with thickness @xmath211 , we have @xmath212 , and @xmath213 . regarding the intermolecular interaction with sio@xmath214 we use @xmath215 , @xmath216 and @xmath217 ( as suggested in  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath218 and @xmath219 ( dotted and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : sexp ] ) .    in order to perform the comparison of the experimental and theoretical spectra ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) ) we choose a constant value for the unknown @xmath90 , namely @xmath220 , and use the same normalization factor for the dft as in  @xcite .",
    "thus , we are left only with @xmath86 and @xmath0 as adjustable parameters .",
    "the fitting values for the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : sexp ] are given in table  [ tab : exp_vs_theor ] .",
    "the low local maximum for @xmath221 is related to the size of the drops , which is smaller than the distance between them  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find not only increasing values of time as one moves from inner to outer regions ( as expected ) , but a decrease of the corresponding values of @xmath0 is also required for the fitting .",
    "this implies that the stochastic noise is somehow different at the sampled regions which , in turn , correspond to distinct liquid lifetimes .",
    "however , the relatively large values of @xmath0 for the first three images suggest that the noise is practically white at the beginning , and that spatial correlation becomes important only for larger times when @xmath0 decreases significantly .",
    "in general , it is then expected that the spectrum for earlier times ( i.e. , near the outer borders of the laser spot ) correspond to a quasi white noise , but the noise becomes more and more spatially correlated as one goes to the center of the spot ( i.e. as the liquid lifetimes increase ) . in fact , the correlation length , @xmath139 , can be estimated considering the value of @xmath0 and the length of the image , which can be assumed as the periodicity length , @xmath121 . for the images corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : sexp ] we have @xmath222 , so that we obtain @xmath223 as shown in table  [ tab : exp_vs_theor ] .",
    "moreover , note that @xmath139 finally approaches @xmath150 ( @xmath224 ) , which is also very close to @xmath225 ( @xmath226 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath139 turns out to be very close to the average distance between drops .",
    ".best fit values from the comparison of the stochastic model with spatial correlation with experimental spectra of unstable liquid metal films . here , we have @xmath227 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work we have considered the effect of correlated thermal noise on the instability of a liquid thin film under the action of viscous , capillary and intermolecular forces by adding a stochastic term in the lubrication approximation equation for the film thickness .",
    "this term depends on the noise amplitude that is spatially self  correlated within a characteristic microscopic distance , @xmath139 .",
    "the linear stability analysis ( lsa ) of the resulting equation shows that this yields a new factor in the stochastic part of the instability spectrum , which is given by the fourier transform of the correlation function that can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the hilbert operator associated with it .    in order to observe the nonlinear effects on the evolution of the instability",
    ", we also perform numerical simulations of the full lubrication equation using different seeds to generate the random sequence of amplitudes for the stochastic term ( so that a realization corresponds to each seed ) , and average the resulting power spectra to obtain a representative spectrum to be compared with the one predicted by the lsa .",
    "as expected , we find a good agreement with lsa for early times .",
    "interestingly , for late times we obtain that the wavenumber of the maximum of the spectra tends to approach the deterministic value , @xmath152 , corresponding to the lsa without stochasticity .",
    "since the lsa with stochasticity also tends to @xmath152 , we can conclude that the typical lengths of the patterns in advanced stages of the instability with stochasticity seem to be close to the length of maximum growth rate of the linear deterministic modes .",
    "therefore , encouraged by this result we also compare the lsa prediction with the experimental data from the instability of melted copper films on a silicon oxide substrate .",
    "these data correspond to the early stages , where the holes start to grow , as well as to the stages of drops formation , i.e. after having passed through the processes of film breakup and dewetting .",
    "a special feature of these data is that they come from different spatial regions of the laser spot , and thus received distinct illuminations .",
    "thus , different times of a single evolution can be attributed to each region .",
    "these times were estimated here by fitting the lsa power spectrum to each experimental one with its corresponding value of @xmath0 . as a result",
    ", we found that the early stages of this experiment evolved with a practically white noise in space , while a strong spatial correlation appeared in the spectra for late times .",
    "this shows that the explanation of experimental results in the nanometric scale requires the inclusion of some thermal noise in the modeling .",
    "in particular , correlated noise seems to be an important factor in the central regions of the laser spot , i.e. those with larger liquid lifetimes .",
    "we believe that our results justify further testing with more detailed experimental data .",
    "here , we calculate the eigenvalues of the hilbert - schmidt operator @xmath127 as defined by given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigmak0 ] ) and ( [ eq : f ] ) . by using the variable @xmath228 ,",
    "the eigenvalues can be written as @xmath229 where @xmath230 and @xmath231 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) . in order to perform the above integral",
    ", we make the change of variables @xmath232 , which leads to the following expression , @xmath233 this one allows us to write eq .",
    "( [ eq : aint ] ) in terms of @xmath234 , as @xmath235 the above substitution is convenient in view of the the relation , @xmath236 which becomes useful here upon defining @xmath237 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath238 where @xmath239 is the bessel function of order @xmath240 .",
    "now , we can also use the property @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath240 . by replacing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : generatrix1 ] ) and ( [ eq : jmim ] ) into eq .",
