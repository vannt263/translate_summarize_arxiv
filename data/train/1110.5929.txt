    "more than 700 extrasolar planets have been identified to date in over 500 planetary systems .",
    "most of these planets were discovered via radial velocity measurements . as a result ,",
    "only a handful of them are less than 10 earth masses ; the vast majority are gas giants resembling jupiter .",
    "they are also in extremely close orbits to their host stars , making these systems dramatically different from ours .",
    "a large number of additional candidate transiting systems have been found recently with the kepler mission @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the great majority of known exoplanet systems , our own solar system has a complex configuration with gas giants at significant distances from their central star and rocky planets / asteroids within the giant planet zone .",
    "the direct detection of rocky planets and planetesimals around other stars is only feasible under very rare circumstances .",
    "one of the most productive approaches is indirectly via the thermal emission of their planetary debris dust belts .",
    "ever since the discoveries with iras @xcite , we know that extrasolar systems may harbor disks of dust / debris that are generated by planetesimal collisions .",
    "the dust reprocesses the stellar light and emits it as thermal radiation in the 10 - 1000 @xmath0 wavelength range .",
    "a prototypical example of such a system is fomalhaut , where a planet is shepherding the star s debris disk resolved in both scattered light @xcite and in infrared emission @xcite .",
    "debris disks highlight the constituents of planetary systems that are many to hundreds of au away from their stars .    with the launch of the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    ", many observations have been obtained to detect and possibly to resolve debris disks in the infrared regime .",
    "debris disks have been probed around all types of stars , both in stellar clusters and in the field .",
    "these observations showed that even though debris disks are common around stars of all spectral types , they are more likely to be detected in the earlier stages of stellar evolution @xcite . we have also learned that debris disks may be located close to or far from their central stars , that there are systems with multiple debris rings ( such as our solar system ) , and that there can be wide varieties of mineralogical compositions within the disks @xcite .",
    "debris disk studies are now a major component of the herschel observing program @xcite , which will provide substantial advances in our understanding of their outer zones .    interpreting these results",
    "demands theoretical insights in a variety of areas .",
    "for example , attempts have been made to understand the evolution of debris disks as a function of stellar type by studying them in stellar clusters of different ages .",
    "as concluded in @xcite , solar - type stars in the field @xcite and in clusters @xcite may show a faster decay trend compared to that observed for earlier - type stars @xcite , although the difference is subtle and needs confirmation .",
    "the decay trends of the fractional luminosity ( @xmath1 ) show a large range in values .",
    "@xcite find a decay @xmath2 when fitting iso / iras data , while @xcite get a much shallower decay @xmath3 .",
    "the majority of surveys however find a decay @xmath4 @xcite . a better theoretical understanding is needed to sort out these results and to provide testable hypotheses that can be compared with the observations .",
    "only a handful of debris disks have been resolved ; for the majority , we only know the integrated infrared excess emission . finding the underlying spatial distribution of the debris in these disks is not straightforward , as any spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can be modeled with a degenerate set of debris rings at different distances .",
    "although much of the uncertainty is associated with the optical constants of the grains , another under - appreciated issue is the grain size distribution .",
    "collisional models can reduce the number of free parameters in the sed models by determining the stable size distribution of particles in the disks .",
    "observations of resolved debris disks also have raised questions that can best be addressed by theoretical models .",
    "for example , spitzer mips images have shown a significant extended halo of dust around vega @xcite , both at 24 and 70 @xmath0 .",
    "initial calculations hypothesized the halo around vega to be a result of a high outflow of dust due to radiation pressure from a recent high - mass collisional event @xcite , while @xcite model it as a result of weakly bound particles on highly eccentric orbits .",
    "further modeling and deep observations of additional systems will help distinguish these two possibilities .    in this paper , we describe a new algorithm for modeling debris disks , in which we refine the physics and numerical methods used in collisional cascade models . in  2 , we briefly outline previous models and introduce the basics of our algorithm . in ",
    "3 we detail our numerical methods , followed in  4 by our approach for including simplified dynamics . in the last section we compare our numerical algorithm to previous ones and discuss in detail the differences between the codes and the effects those differences have on the outcome of the collisional cascades .",
    "we also supplement our paper with an extended appendix that covers the numerical methods and the verification tests of our code .",
    "collisional cascades have been studied both analytically and using collisional integro - differential numerical models .",
    "the classic analytic models of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite took into account both erosive and catastrophic collisional outcomes , assumed a material strength that was independent of the particle mass , a particle mass distribution with no cut - offs , and a constant interaction velocity .",
    "these models yielded steady state power - law mass distribution indices of -11/6 .",
    "this result was in general agreement with the measured size distribution of asteroids in the solar system .",
    "more recently , analytic models by @xcite and @xcite showed that the fractional infrared luminosity in a collision - dominated steady - state system decays following a @xmath5 power - law .",
    "as introduced later in this section , @xcite find a different value for this decay timescale .",
    "@xcite also derived a maximum mass and fractional luminosity as a function of age and distance from the central star , which they then used to classify systems with possible recent transient events .",
    "however , numerical models are needed to expand on these results . in the particular case of our solar system , sophisticated numerical models were developed to track the evolution of the largest asteroids @xcite .",
    "they have been further improved to reproduce the observed wavy structure in the size distribution at the very highest masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models yield power - law distributions that deviate from the classic solution of @xcite , with certain regions steeper than it and others shallower . using a steeper or shallower",
    "distribution and extrapolating it to dust sizes can result in substantial offsets in the number of particles and thus in the infrared emission originating from them for a given planetesimal mass .",
    "conversely , the particle size distribution affects the underlying disk mass calculated from the observed infrared emission .",
    "a complete numerical model of collisional cascades would follow outcomes from all types of collisions , include a kinematic description of the system , incorporate coagulation below certain thresholds , and do all this with high numerical fidelity .",
    "although such a model has not yet been built because of its complexity , there are a number of approaches in the literature that model collisional cascades down to particles of micron size , each with distinctive strengths and weaknesses .",
    "the collisional code ace has been used in many studies @xcite .",
    "it follows the evolution of the particle size distributions as well as the spatial distribution of the dust in debris disks .",
    "the code initially only accounted for collisions resulting in catastrophic outcomes , while the latest version @xcite includes erosive ( cratering ) events as well .",
    "the collisional outcome prescriptions are based on the @xcite particle - in - a - box model , but with a more elaborate description of material strengths in collision outcomes as well as the radiation force blowout .",
    "a strength of the code is that it calculates the dynamical evolution of the systems , as well .",
    "since following the dynamical evolution of a system makes large demands on computer memory space and cpu speed , the code can only model the size distribution with a low number of mass grid points ; it originally used a first order euler ordinary differential equation ( ode ) solving algorithm , but has been modified to include a more precise one ( a.  krivov , priv .",
    "comm . ) . @xcite and @xcite applied this algorithm to debris disks in general and to the specific example of the vega system .",
    "they followed the orbital paths of fragments and placed special emphasis on radiation effects .",
    "@xcite modeled debris disk evolution around solar - type stars and found , both with analytic and numerical analysis , that the majority of physical quantities , such as the mass and the infrared luminosity , decrease with time as @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "this is in contrast with the observed @xmath5 decay found by some obervations @xcite .",
    "however , the population synthesis verification tests in @xcite yield good agreement with the latest spitzer observations .",
    "thbault et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) study the evolution of extended debris disks with a particle - in - a - box algorithm .",
    "they include both catastrophic and erosive collisions and employ resolution and numerical methods similar to the ones implemented in the ace code .",
    "they model the extended disk structure by dividing the disk into separate , but interacting rings .",
    "their model does not include dynamics .",
    "@xcite showed that a series of wave patterns is produced in the mass distribution of particles when a low - mass cutoff is enforced , such as in the case of a radiation force blowout limit .",
    "this signature is produced by the other debris disk numerical models as well @xcite .",
    "however , the conditions under which these waves are produced have not been completely analyzed .",
    "@xcite do show that the amplitude and wavelength of the waves is collisional velocity dependent .",
    "such strong features in the particle size distribution are not observed in the dust collected within the solar system . the interplanetary dust flux model of @xcite , which used in situ satellite measurements of the micro - meteroid flux in the solar system , and the terrestrial particle flux measurements of the ldef satellite @xcite only show a single peak at @xmath8 in the dust distribution . however , these measurements detected particles that were brought inward from the outer parts of the solar system via poynting - robertson drag and particles removed from the inner parts of the solar system via radiation force blowout .",
    "their results are reflections of more than a single parent distribution and of multiple physical effects .",
    "the dynamical code of @xcite models the evolution and 3d structure of the kuiper belt , with a monte carlo algorithm and a simple treatment of particle collisions .",
    "their models predict that grain - grain collisions are important even in a low density debris ring such as our kuiper belt .",
    "@xcite and @xcite both emphasize the strong effects of fragmentation in their models . @xcite",
    "point out that including erosive ( cratering ) events is necessary for their models to reproduce the observed surface brightness profiles of vega .",
    "@xcite also show that a complete collisional treatment will result in significant deviations from the classic power - law solution .",
    "our goal is to set up a numerical model that places special emphasis on investigating these issues .",
    "our new empirical description of collisional outcomes avoids discontinuities between erosive and catastrophic collisions and thus enables a more stable and accurate calculation .",
    "we also solve the full scattering integral , thus ensuring mass conservation and the propagation of the largest remnants of collision outcomes .",
    "finally , we use second order integration and fourth order ode solving methods to improve the numerical accuracy .",
    "below , we outline the physical and numerical techniques we will employ . in the appendix , we present verification tests of these treatments .      in collision theory ,",
    "two types of outcomes are generally distinguished : catastrophic and erosive ( the latter also known as cratering ) . for an erosive collision ( ec )",
    ", the collisional energy is relatively small , resulting in one big fragment whose mass is close to the original target mass . in the case of a catastrophic collision ( cc ) , both colliding bodies are completely destroyed .",
    "we illustrate these outcomes in figure [ fig : toy ] . in the first panel ,",
    "we plot the outcome distribution of an erosive collision , where there is a single large @xmath9 fragment and a distribution of dust at much lower masses .",
    "the @xmath9 fragment is over half the mass of the original target mass @xmath10 .",
    "the redistributed mass is equal to the cratered mass plus the projectile mass .",
    "the largest fragment in the distribution , @xmath11 , is arbitrarily set to be 20% of the cratered mass . in  [ sec : outcomes ] we elaborate on the validity of this arbitrary value .    in the second panel of figure [ fig : toy ]",
    ", we plot the outcome at the boundary case between catastrophic and erosive collisions , where the single largest fragment @xmath9 is exactly half of the original target mass @xmath10 .",
    "the redistributed mass is equal to the other half of the target mass @xmath10 plus the projectile mass .",
    "the largest fragment in the distribution , @xmath11 , is arbitrarily set to be 20% of the cratered mass here as well ( 10% of the target mass ) .",
    "finally , in the third panel of figure [ fig : toy ] , we plot the outcome of a super - catastrophic collision , where the target and projectile masses are equal .",
    "the mass of the single largest fragment @xmath9 is given by the relation of @xcite .",
    "the redistributed mass is equal to @xmath12 plus the projectile mass .",
    "the largest fragment in the distribution , @xmath11 , is arbitrarily set to be at @xmath13 .    in reality",
    ", there is no strict boundary between catastrophic and erosive collisions @xcite .",
    "the outcomes between these two extreme scenarios should be continuous . in laboratory experiments , however , it is easier to test the extreme outcomes . in our model",
    ", we use the laboratory experiments to describe the extreme solutions and connect them with simple interpolations throughout the parameter space .",
    "we revise the currently used models to include an @xmath9 fragment for both erosive and catastrophic collisions as a separate new gain term . in this treatment ,",
    "the placement of the @xmath9 fragments is grid size independent , further improving precision and guaranteeing the accurate downward propagation of these fragments .",
    "we are able to express the loss term in a much simpler form , including collisions from both regimes .",
    "previous models only included a full loss term for catastrophic collisions and removed fractions of particles for erosive collisions .",
    "the slope of the power - law particle redistribution has been studied extensively .",
    "@xcite used a single power - law value from the largest mass to the smallest .",
    "later experiments have shown that a double ( or even a triple ) power - law distribution is a more likely outcome ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this has led to the widespread use of a double power - law for the redistribution in numerous collision models .",
    "we conducted numerical tests that demonstrated that there is negligible difference in using a wide range of slopes with a single power - law .",
    "the fact that the outcome does not depend on the bimodality of the redistribution has also been proven by @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have used the simplest method of redistributing the fragmented particles with a single power - law slope from the second largest @xmath11 fragment downwards , scaled to conserve mass . as a nominal value",
    ", we will use -11/6 as the redistribution slope .",
    "this is close to the initial value of -1.8 used by @xcite .",
    "the classic solution to the collisional evolution of an asteroid system involves solving the @xcite integro - differential equation .",
    "this was first done by @xcite .",
    "because erosive collisions remove only a small part of the target mass in a collision , @xcite expressed the erosive removal term in a differential form .",
    "this is not appropriate for our case .",
    "our system has well defined boundaries ; thus a continuity equation can not be used .",
    "the locality of the collisional outcomes in phase space is not certain either .    therefore , to solve the smoluchowski equation for the problem at hand , we need to solve the full scattering integral .",
    "this is complicated numerically , as the integrations must extend over the entire dynamical range of @xmath14 orders of magnitude in mass . to be able to perform accurate integrations over such a large interval",
    ", we need to use a large number of grid points and sophisticated numerical methods . to achieve this in a reasonable time",
    ", we chose to drop the radial dependence of the various quantities and to solve the equations under a `` particle - in - a - box '' approximation . with this approach , we lose radial and velocity information but gain accuracy .",
    "poynting - robertson drag can be an effective form of removing particles from the disk , so we include it in our model .",
    "however , the strongest and most dominating radiation effect is the removal of particles via radial radiation forces .",
    "these act on orbital timescales and can remove or place particles on extremely eccentric orbits .",
    "this gives rise to the challenge of incorporating a radial dependent removal term into a particle - in - a - box model that does not carry radial information . in ",
    "and  3.1.2 , we discuss our approach for incorporating these radiation effects .",
    "stellar wind drag is an important dust removal effect for late type stars such as in the case of au mic @xcite , an m1 spectral - type star .",
    "we concentrate on modeling debris disks in early- and solar - type systems , so we chose to neglect the effects of stellar wind drag .",
    "we do not take into account the yarkovsky effect either , as it is small in high - density debris disks compared to the other radiation effects .     around stars of spectral - type a0 , f0 , g0 , g5 and k0 .",
    "the thin double - dashed black line is at the critical value @xmath15=0.5 , above which radiation forces are able to remove particles from circular orbits . ]",
    "we now discuss our collisional code ( code - m - collisional disk evolution model ) , which solves the system of integro - differential equations that describe the evolution of the number densities of particles of different masses .",
    "the code includes outcomes from erosive ( cratering ) collisions and catastrophic collisions and qualitatively follows the effects originating from radiation forces and poynting - robertson drag .",
    "our system - dependent parameters are : the spectral - type of the central star ( which defines the stellar mass @xmath16 and the magnitude of the radiation effects it will have on the particles ) , the minimum and maximum particle masses ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively ) , the radius , width , and height of the debris ring ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively ) , the total mass within the ring ( @xmath22 ) , and the slope of the initial size distribution of the particles ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we estimate the total volume of the narrow ring , @xmath24 , as @xmath25 which together with @xmath22 defines a mass density .      in general , the change in the differential number density @xmath26 at any given time for a particle of mass @xmath27 is given by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the poynting - robertson drag ( prd ) term and @xmath30 is the sum of the collisional terms .",
    "we define the differential number density of particles such that @xmath31 is the time - dependent total number density of particles within the ring .",
    "effects such as radiation force blowout and poynting - robertson drag are able to deplete the low - mass end of the distribution , which in turn alters the evolution of the disk and more importantly , its infrared signature . because we do not follow the radial profile of the various debris disk quantities in our algorithm , we can only capture the effects of radiation forces in a simplified way .",
    "a complete analysis of the effects of the poynting - robertson drag is given by @xcite , who correct many errors made in previous work .",
    "this effect causes the particles to slow in their orbit and follow an inward spiral .",
    "@xcite show that the change in the orbital distance can be written as @xmath32 where g is the gravitational constant , c is the speed of light , and @xmath33 is the ratio of radiation to gravitational force experienced by a particle of mass @xmath27 .",
    "we calculate the @xmath33 values as a function of the particle masses , optical constants , and the spectral type of the central star following @xcite . for the calculations we assume a silicate composition for the particles and a bulk density of @xmath34 g @xmath35 .",
    "we show the calculated @xmath33 values for a few different spectral type stars in figure [ fig : beta ] .",
    "we use equation ( [ eq : prd ] ) to derive an approximate term that captures the effect of poynting - robertson drag as ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : main ] ] ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 the mass dependence of the timescale comes from the mass dependence of the parameter @xmath15 . in principle , once a particle is removed from our collisional system it still radiates in the ir ; it just does not take part in the collisional cascade .",
    "we keep track of the removal rate of these particles , but do not follow the total amount removed or their infrared emission .",
    "the effects of the radiation force blowout are incorporated in our code with the simplified dynamics treatment introduced in  4 , and not by the inclusion of a separate term in the differential equation as are the effects of poynting - robertson drag . removing a particle from the collisional system via radiation force blowout",
    "requires roughly an orbital timescale @xmath38 as we will show in  4 , under our assumptions a newly created particle of mass @xmath27 gets removed via radiation force blowout if @xmath39 and is unaffected by radiation forces when @xmath40 .",
    "although the radiation force blowout timescale is not used in our code , in figure [ fig : prdvsrfb ] we compare it to the poynting - robertson drag timescale around an a0 spectral - type star , assuming a disk width - to - radius ratio of 0.1 .",
    "the plot shows that within reasonable disk radii estimates , radiation force blowout will always dominate in the @xmath41 domain , while outside of it poynting - robertson drag will be the stronger effect . whether poynting - robertson drag is an effective form of removal in the @xmath42 domain depends on the number density of particles in the ring , i.e. ,  the collisional timescale of the system @xcite .",
    "the outcomes are similar for all spectral type stars and for realistic @xmath43 values .    .",
    "the dashed lines give the orbital distances as a function of particle size , where the poynting - robertson drag and blowout timescales are 0.1 , 0.01 , 0.001 and 0.0001 years .",
    "the solid red line gives the distance where the timescale for poynting - robertson drag is equal to the radiation force blowout timescale . above the solid red line ,",
    "radiation force blowout dominates , while below it poynting - robertson drag does .",
    "the plot shows that within reasonable disk radii estimates , radiation force blowout will always dominate in the @xmath41 domain , while outside of it poynting - robertson drag will be the stronger effect . ]",
    "the probability of a collision between particles is a function of their number densities and their collisional cross section .",

    "we express the differential rate of collisions between the two masses as @xmath47 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\                    & = & \\kappa n(m , t)n(m^{\\prime},t ) v \\pi \\left(m^{\\frac{1}{3}}+m{^{\\prime}}^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\right)^2 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is their characteristic collisional velocity , @xmath26 and @xmath49 are the differential number densities for particles of mass @xmath27 and @xmath44 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the bulk mass density of the particles .",
    "the number densities in the problem are naturally all time dependent .",
    "however , for brevity , hereafter we drop the time dependence from our notation .    the decrease or increase in number density at a certain mass",
    "will be determined by three separate events : the removal of particles caused by their interaction with all other particles , the addition of the @xmath9 particles from the interactions of other particles ( see  2.1 and figure [ fig : toy ] ) , and the addition of particles from the redistribution of smaller fragments originating from collisions of other particles .",
    "we express the first event , which describes the removal of particles , as @xmath52 we completely remove all particles from all grid points if they take part in a collision , even if they are the target objects in erosive collisions .",
    "the second event to be described is the addition of the large @xmath9 fragments . to this end",
    ", we need to calculate the mass @xmath10 that will produce a particle of mass @xmath53 when interacting with a particle of mass @xmath44 .",
    "we achieve this with a root finding algorithm from the collisional equations presented in the following sections and calculate it only once in the beginning of each run . in equation form , @xmath54 the lower limit of the integration is the minimum mass in the distribution .",
    "we denote the largest mass @xmath44 that can create a particle of mass @xmath27 as the @xmath9 fragment as @xmath55 .",
    "its value can also be calculated via root finding algorithms and has to be calculated for each value of @xmath27 once in the beginning of each run ( see figure [ fig : x ] in the appendix ) .",
    "these first two integrals may catastrophically cancel , meaning that the difference between the two terms may be significantly smaller than the absolute value of each , causing the former to be artificially set to zero when evaluated numerically .",
    "it is therefore useful to combine these terms into a single integral in a way that will lessen the probability of catastrophic cancellation : @xmath56 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\biggl .",
    "\\int\\limits_{\\mu_x(m)}^{m_{\\rm max } } { \\rm d}m^{\\prime } n(m^{\\prime})n(m)\\bigl(m^{\\frac{1}{3}}+m{^{\\prime}}^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\bigr)^2\\biggr\\}\\ ; , \\label{eq : t1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] unfortunately @xmath57 can still suffer from catastrophic cancellation ( when @xmath44 is much smaller than @xmath27 , and by definition only for the first integral ) .",
    "we overcome this issue by employing a taylor - series expanded form of @xmath57 , as given in the appendix .    the third event in the collisional term",
    "is the addition of the power - law fragments back to the distribution .",

    "the total redistributed mass is @xmath62 where @xmath11 is the largest fragment within the redistribution ( i.e. , the second largest fragment in the collision , after x ; see  2.1 ) .",
    "this gives the scaling factor @xmath63 the precision of this integration depends strongly on the resolution of our grid points , due to the integration limits set by the heaviside function .",
    "we discuss in detail the integration methods we used in the appendix .",
    "the collisional equations can be integrated if the values of @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are known as a function of the colliding masses .",
    "their values are strongly dependent on the outcome of the collision they originate from , which is determined by the energies of the colliding parent bodies .",
    "we show the domains of erosive , interpolated erosive ( explained later in the section ) , and catastrophic collisions as a function of the colliding body masses in figure [ fig : regions ] for collisional velocities of @xmath67 , 1.0 and 1.5 km s@xmath68 .",
    "we introduce the method for calculating collisional velocities from orbital velocities in  4 , but it is a good general approximation that the collisional velocity is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the orbital velocity .",
    "these collisional velocities will then correspond to debris ring radii of 100 , 25 and 10 au around an a spectral type star , respectively .",

    "we use the dispersion strength description of @xcite and discuss our choice in the appendix .",
    "note that , in a more accurate treatment , we would redistribute the relative kinetic energy to both masses and not just to the target mass ( i.e. , divide by @xmath71 instead of @xmath10 ) .",
    "we are , however , using the original definition of @xmath72 ( as opposed to using the relative kinetic energy ) because the @xmath70 values that we will be comparing it to were defined the same way @xcite and this definition makes the problem more tractable numerically .",

    "the obvious difference between ace and code - m , is that ace also evolves the dynamics in the system and takes into account the varying collisional velocities in the system from particles that are in elliptical orbits within the parent ring .",
    "this could easily explain the offset of the first wave given by ace in figure [ fig : krivovm ] .",
    "the increasing offset between the full code - m run and the other two models is likely due to the omission of erosive collisions by @xcite and to using catastrophic collision rates in @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown earlier erosive ( cratering ) collisions to be the dominant effect for mass loss in collisionally evolving systems .",
    "this effect is demonstrated by the code - m model we run with only catastrophic collisions included , which scales exactly with the ace and @xcite models . since code - m",
    "does not include aggregation , the collisions of the smallest particles with the largest bodies is not modeled perfectly .",
    "we assume the realistic distribution decay to lie between the two models given by code - m .    as introduced in ",
    "[ largemass ] , we artificially reduce the collision cross section of the largest particles in the system to zero in order to avoid numerical instabilities .",

    "varying the values of @xmath175 does have an effect on both the evolution of the distribution and the total mass decay .",
    "the effect is only on the largest bodies in the system ; below a size of one hundred meters , the shapes of the distributions remain unchanged , with the only differences being scaling offsets .    visual examination of the distributions in figure [ fig : krivovmass ] hint at a slightly steeper distribution slope for the code - m models than the @xcite and @xcite ones .",
    "since the distributions have wavy structures in them , this is difficult to show with a slope fit .",

    "is also limited to solving the collisional cascade in debris rings , similarly to the initial versions of most collisional models @xcite , some of which have since been expanded to model extended disk structures @xcite .",

    "the redistribution outcome of collisions depends almost solely on the energy of the impact and the colliding masses . in experiments it is common to specify the ratio of the kinetic energy of the projectile to the mass of the target",
    "this ratio is known as the specific energy @xmath176 of the impact . @xcite",
    "already noticed that the fragment distribution of particles depends on @xmath176 ( which they called  rupture energy \" ) when firing aluminum projectiles into glass targets .",
    "their experiments showed that the fragments will have a power - law distribution , with the largest fragment being a function of the specific energy of the impact .",
    "this relationship was first given in equation format in @xcite for basalt targets .",
    "they note an offset from the @xcite results , likely due to material strength differences .",
    "two specific values of @xmath176 are used : @xmath177 ( the shattering specific energy ) and a somewhat larger @xmath178 ( the dispersion specific energy ) .",
    "the value of @xmath177 gives the energy required to shatter the target so that the mass of the largest fragment is no more than half of the original target mass .",
    "however , if the target is large enough , then self gravity pulls the fragments back together , leaving a remnant larger than half of the original .",
    "the larger @xmath178 gives the value of @xmath176 needed to disperse the fragments , so that the largest remaining piece is half of the original target mass . at lower target masses , where self - gravity can be neglected , @xmath179 .",
    "we use @xmath178 in our code and refer to it as @xmath110 .",
    "determining the value of @xmath110 is difficult , especially for such a large range of particle sizes , from @xmath59 m to km . the values for smaller bodies on the order of a few kilograms",
    "are mostly determined from laboratory experiments , while the values for larger bodies are determined from under - surface explosions , observations of large asteroids and with experiments done under very high pressure @xcite .",
    "however , material strength varies greatly as a function of material type , object size , surface type and the number of shattering events an object has gone through over its lifetime .",
    "an object that has gone through many collisions in its lifetime , but still remains in one piece ( descriptively called a  rubble pile \" ) can endure harder collisions , which can actually be absorbed and help to compact the object , rather than dispersing it into smaller particles .",
    "this may seem like an important parameter only for larger objects ; however , the evolution of larger objects significantly influences the evolution of smaller particles , and thus is important in our study .",
    "we also lack experiments done with targets and impactors cooled down to space temperatures of 100 - 150 k , where one would assume that objects get more brittle and easier to shatter .    experiments clearly show that @xmath110 is a function of the target mass @xmath10 , meaning that different mass targets will get shattered ( with a @xmath164 largest fragment ) by different specific energies .",
    "@xcite reviews experimental and theoretical results on collisions and strength curves .",
    "a common result for all of them is a minimum in the strength curve for bodies around 0.3 km in radius , where planetesimals are easiest to disperse ( the number of cavities and cracks weakening the bodies increases , while self - gravitation is not dominant yet ) . as a result",
    ", there is a bump in the size distribution of minor planets in the solar system around this size .",
    "smooth particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) models give the @xmath110 strength curve for larger bodies , while experiments help to anchor the curve for smaller rocks on the scale of a few cm in radius .",
    "it is still not clear whether the power - law shape of the curve can be extrapolated down to micron size particles , where experiments can not be carried out . to study the collisional evolution of the smallest particles",
    ", the exact value of the strength curve must be known . in the absence of any models",
    "/ experiments currently at those sizes , the best that can be done is a simple extrapolation of the strength curve to those regimes . @xcite introduce a velocity - dependent tensile strength curve , that is defined by variables such that it removes ambiguities over material density and projectile - to - target mass ratio . their tensile strength curve is ideal for low - velocity ( 1 - 300  m  s@xmath68 ) collisions , such as those found during planet formation or at large radii debris disks .",
    "however , their universal relationship does not hold for conditions that strongly depart from the catastrophic disruption regime ( @xmath180 ) .    in our models we use the @xcite dispersion strength curve .",
    "it is derived from sph models , represents a reasonable average of all previous strength curves , and is impact angle averaged .",

    "<S> we develop a new numerical algorithm to model collisional cascades in debris disks . because of the large dynamical range in particle masses </S>",
    "<S> , we solve the integro - differential equations describing erosive and catastrophic collisions in a particle - in - a - box approach , while treating the orbital dynamics of the particles in an approximate fashion . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a new scheme for describing erosive ( cratering ) collisions that yields a continuous set of outcomes as a function of colliding masses . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the stability and convergence characteristics of our algorithm and compare it with other treatments . </S>",
    "<S> we show that incorporating the effects of erosive collisions results in a decay of the particle distribution that is significantly faster than with purely catastrophic collisions . </S>"
