    "the theory ( 1 ) has global @xmath12 symmetry . in this theory the meson fields",
    "are related to corresponding quark operators .",
    "for example , at the tree level the vector and the axial - vector mesons are expressed as the quark operators @xmath13 the pseudoscalar mesons are via the mechanism of the nonlinear @xmath14 model introduced .",
    "this mechanism makes this theory different from the njl model . in qcd",
    "the mesons are not independent degrees of freedoms . therefore , there are no kinetic terms for meson fields in eq .",

    "this procedure is equivalent to one quark loop calculation .",
    "the process deriving the lagrangian of mesons has nonperturbative nature .",
    "the kinetic terms of the meson fields are generated by the quark loop diagrams .",

    "it is natural that @xmath128 the quantum numbers of @xmath127 are @xmath129 and in the lagrangian ( 1 ) there is already a term @xmath130 .",
