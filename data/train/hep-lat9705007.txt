    "in studying the fluctuations of a complex statistical field theory , it is frequently useful to define simple , effective degrees of freedom",
    ". a wise choice of these degrees of freedom allows one to focus on specific physics .",
    "we are interested in the first - order phase transition of the su(3 ) gauge theory @xcite , specifically in surface phenomena such as the surface tension between the phases @xcite and the stability of bubbles @xcite .",
    "since the transition is first - order , all correlation lengths stay finite on either side .",
    "this means that there should be no delicate issues related to renormalization - group fixed points and the symmetries that characterize them .",
    "we are thus led to degrees of freedom which simply specify whether a given region is in the confined or unconfined phase . assigning values of @xmath0 according to the two possibilities ,",
    "we are led to an effective theory of ising spins .",
    "this exercise is familiar from study of the liquid ",
    "gas transition @xcite .",
    "one assigns values to a local ising spin @xmath1 according to the local density @xmath2 of the fluid . at the first - order phase boundary",
    "@xmath3 the density is discontinuous , and this is reflected in a discontinuity in the magnetization @xmath4 of the effective ising theory .",
    "the simplest ising action has only one term that is odd in the spins , namely , the magnetic field term @xmath5 .",
    "the first - order transition occurs perforce at @xmath6 , and one identifies the liquid  gas phase boundary with the segment of the @xmath7 axis between the origin and the ising critical point @xmath8 .",
    "as one slides along the phase boundary towards the liquid  gas critical point , the discontinuity in @xmath2 decreases until it reaches zero at the critical point ; correspondingly , the discontinuity in @xmath4 vanishes as one approaches @xmath8 .    the simplest ising model , however , is incapable of describing an arbitrary first - order phase transition . an easy way to see",
    "this is to note that its @xmath9 symmetry implies that @xmath10 .",
    "since the correspondence between @xmath1 and @xmath2 depends on an arbitrary assignment in the first place , there is no reason to suppose that this symmetry reflects accurately the values of @xmath2 on either side of @xmath11 .",
    "hence there must be more than one odd term in the ising action , in order to move the transition away from @xmath6 and thus to destroy the @xmath9 symmetry about the transition .    for the su(3 )",
    "confinement transition , we seek to characterize a neighborhood of a site  *",
    "n * as confining or non - confining .",
    "we naturally settle on the wilson line  @xmath12 as the quantity which does this . as an order parameter of the @xmath13 symmetry of the euclidean theory ,",
    "@xmath14 is discontinuous at the transition , with @xmath15 in the confining phase below the transition and @xmath16 in the plasma phase above .",
    "we use the modulus of @xmath12 , suitably smeared , to assign a value to @xmath17 .",
    "( this smearing reflects the fact that confinement is a property of a neighborhood , not of a point . )",
    "running a monte carlo simulation of the gauge theory , we generate configurations of @xmath12 which translate into configurations of @xmath18 .",
    "we then use the ising model s schwinger - dyson equations @xcite to determine an approximation to the effective ising action @xmath19 $ ] .    this definition of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath14 integrates over the @xmath13 dynamics of the euclidean theory .",
    "since we are interested in understanding bubbles of the confining phase in the plasma and vice - versa , distinguishing among the three ordered phases is unnecessary .",
    "previous work @xcite has taken the opposite approach , projecting the complex wilson line onto 3-state potts spins @xmath20 .",
    "this makes it harder to identify bubbles of the disordered phase because they will only be visible when calculating averages of @xmath21 over sizable neighborhoods .",
    "since our @xmath1 spins depend on the magnitude of @xmath14 , they show directly those places where @xmath22 is small and hence disordered .",
    "since @xmath13 domain structure plays a role in the confinement phase transition , one might be concerned that domain walls should somehow be represented in the effective action .",
    "we note that calculations @xcite have shown that , near the transition , the disordered phase wets the ordered phases , and moreover that two ordered domains with different @xmath13 orientations will sandwich a disordered domain between them .",
    "we note also that the physics of fluctuations among the three ordered phases will influence the ising couplings because the effective action comes from an integration over _ all _ other degrees of freedom in the gauge theory .",
    "nevertheless , integrating thus over the @xmath13 fluctuations may impair the ability of the ising theory to represent the phase transition correctly .",
    "our effective ising action turns out to be discontinuous at the phase transition .",
    "although this might be due to the small number of terms we permit in the action , it might stem from the use of ising variables itself .",
    "we discuss this further below .",
    "we simulate the su(3 ) gauge theory at finite temperature by using , as usual , a euclidean lattice of @xmath23 sites , with the physical temperature given by @xmath24 in terms of the lattice spacing @xmath25 .",
    "all results presented in this paper were obtained from lattices with @xmath26 .",
    "the gauge theory is governed by the wilson plaquette action , @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the order parameter for the confinement phase transition is the wilson line , defined on a site * n * of a three - dimensional lattice via @xmath29    as discussed in the introduction , we will use @xmath14 to define the effective ising spins @xmath1 which will label a neighborhood on the lattice as confining or non - confining .",
    "a first attempt might be to define @xmath30 the problem with this is that @xmath12 fluctuates violently from site to site .",
    "even deep in the connfining phase , where @xmath15 , @xmath12 is by no means confined to a region around zero , and in fact fills the entire wedge available to it in the complex plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . @xmath1 as defined by ( [ sigma1 ] ) thus does not offer a good definition of a domain in the confining phase .",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath12 are reduced if it is averaged over a small volume .",
    "we define @xmath31}$ ] to be the average of @xmath14 over the @xmath32 block surrounding is even then * n * is a site of the dual lattice .",
    "] * n*. a glance at fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that @xmath33}$ ] discriminates well , on a local basis , between domains that resemble the two respective phases .",
    "@xmath34}$ ] , on the other hand , fluctuates too little about the volume average of @xmath14 , so that , with a reasonable value chosen for @xmath35 , the @xmath1 spins would lose all information about fluctuations and remain entirely ordered with @xmath36 .",
    "we thus choose @xmath33}$ ] for insertion in ( [ sigma1 ] ) to calculate the @xmath1 configurations ; as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we set @xmath37 .    with the definition of @xmath1 in hand , we turn to the determination of the effective ising action . in principle",
    "the action has an infinite number of terms ; we truncate it to a combination of a magnetic field term and two- and three- spin terms with range 2 , @xmath38=\\sum_{\\alpha}\\beta_{\\alpha}\\o^{\\alpha}\\ , \\label{seff}\\ ] ] where the seven operators @xmath39 are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the two - spin operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 , as well as the three - spin operator @xmath42 , couple spins within distance @xmath43 ; the remaining operators reach out to distance 2 .",
    "a schwinger - dyson equation of the ising theory is derived by flipping a spin @xmath18 in the sum defining the expectation value of some operator .",
    "for the operators in table [ table1 ] , we have @xmath44 where we have defined @xmath45 to be those terms in @xmath39 that contain @xmath18 , and @xmath46 is the part of the action that contains @xmath18 .",
    "these are seven equations for determining the seven unknowns @xmath47 . after generating an ensemble of @xmath1 configurations via monte carlo simulation of the gauge theory , we determine @xmath47 iteratively as solutions of ( [ sde ] ) .    as a consistency check",
    ", one may use the vacuum equation @xmath48 or the schwinger - dyson equation for any other operator in the theory . a more satisfying check , however , is to run a direct monte carlo simulation of the ising model with action ( [ seff ] ) to see if the expectation values of @xmath39 as computed in the gauge theory are reproduced .",
    "this was the procedure we followed .",
    "we calculated error estimates by subdividing the ensemble .",
    "we simulated the su(3 ) gauge theory on a lattice of volume @xmath49 .",
    "the confinement phase transition is in the neighborhood @xcite of @xmath50 , and we settled on the value @xmath51 after seeing no tunneling between the coexisting phases in moderately long runs at that coupling .",
    "straightforward application of the method described above gives an ising action for a three - dimensional lattice of volume @xmath52 .",
    "we show the couplings for this action , derived from ordered and disordered runs at @xmath51 , in table  [ table2 ] . in both cases",
    ", the action contains couplings with range @xmath53  and  2 ( @xmath54  and  @xmath55 , respectively ) which are as strong as the shorter - ranged two - spin couplings ( @xmath40  and  @xmath41 ) and compete with them in sign . , and that _ negative _ values for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 indicate ferromagnetic couplings . ]",
    "this raises the suspicion that a longer - ranged ising action is needed to reproduce the ising configurations correctly , and that the range-2 action is too crude a truncation .",
    "this suspicion is confirmed by simulating directly the ising model with the couplings just derived . as seen in table  [ table3 ] ,",
    "comparison of @xmath60 with the averages from the gauge configurations shows poor agreement . prefers a positive magnetization , but the positive three - spin couplings @xmath61 and @xmath62 compete with it and turn the magnetization negative . ]",
    "this problem was encountered by deckert _",
    "@xcite in a calculation of the effective action for the @xmath9 gauge theory .",
    "a solution , noted in @xcite , is to perform a block - spin transformation on the spins , so that the effective action has twice the range .",
    "we do this simply by decimating the ising spins , already defined via smeared averages , to an @xmath63 sublattice .",
    "solving the schwinger - dyson equations with the decimated configurations gives the couplings shown in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "the longer - ranged two - spin couplings , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , are negligible , as is the straight three - spin coupling @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , comparison of an ising monte carlo simulation with the gauge theory ( see table  [ table5 ] ) now gives satisfactory agreement .",
    "the effective ising couplings shown in table  [ table4 ] vary smoothly as @xmath64 is varied on either side of the transition , but they are discontinuous across the transition . at @xmath51",
    "we have , then , _ two _ actions , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which are the limits of @xmath19 $ ] from the ordered and disordered sides of the transition .",
    "curiously , we find that @xmath66 is at a point of phase coexistence , that is , at a phase transition between phases with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we show in table  [ table5 ] the expectation values of the seven operators @xmath69 for @xmath65 and for both phases of @xmath66 . for @xmath66 ,",
    "the phase with @xmath67 describes well the expectation values in the gauge theory on the disordered side of its transition .",
    "the other phase of @xmath66 , of course , does not ; neither does it describe the ordered phase of the gauge theory .",
    "the action @xmath66 thus `` knows '' that it describes a phase transition , but it is capable of describing correctly only one of the phases . @xmath65 describes the ordered phase well , and shows no phase coexistence .",
    "the discontinuity in the effective action is an example of the singularities that can result from renormalization group transformations .",
    "griffiths and pearce @xcite noted that a blocked action might be a singular function of the unblocked couplings even though the blocking transformation is local . later work @xcite found discontinuities in the blocked action associated with first - order phase transitions in the original action .",
    "it was conjectured that there may be different renormalization - group flows resulting from the various metastable phases at a fixed coupling . in view of theorems proven by van enter , fernndez , and sokal @xcite",
    ", however , such discontinuities are impossible in an effective action which possesses finite range in the infinite - volume limit .",
    "our effective action , however , is approximate in that it contains a small number of couplings .",
    "adding longer - ranged and multi - spin terms to the action will bring consistency with the theorem of van enter _",
    "_ in one of two ways : either the couplings will become continuous @xcite , or the effective action(s ) will acquire too many non - local terms in the infinite - volume limit , meaning the statistical measure is non - gibbsian . in the first case , we will have an effective action well suited to describing the phase transition ; in the second case , the conclusion will be that an ising description of the phase transition is impossible .",
    "deciding between these alternatives requires great numerical precision .",
    "the discontinuity of the effective action is sensitive to the definition of the effective degrees of freedom , just as singularities in the renormalization group may be created or eliminated by different choices of the block - spin transformation .",
    "a more sophisticated definition of @xmath18 , perhaps using a kadanoff kernel to associate it with the smeared @xmath12 , may restore continuity , even without marked increase in the number of interaction terms .",
    "note also that a reduction of the gauge theory to @xmath13 spins in @xcite resulted in an action that is continuous across the phase transition .",
    "perhaps a more complex effective spin , combining ising with @xmath13 , will yield an effective action that offers both continuity and a local description of confinement physics .",
    "we thank doug toussaint for giving us a copy of the milc collaboration s monte carlo code for the su(3 ) lattice gauge theory , a program employing overrelaxation with the kennedy - pendleton heat bath algorithm .",
    "we are indebted to professor kurt binder for a very valuable conversation , to professor jechiel lichtenstadt for a discussion of error analysis , and to the weizmann institute of science for its continuing hospitality .",
