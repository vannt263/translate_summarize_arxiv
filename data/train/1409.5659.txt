    "energy harvesting ( eh ) technology may provide a perpetual power supply to energy - constrained wireless systems such as sensor networks . to maximize the system performance ,",
    "the eh transmitters should adapt their output powers based on the energy harvested up to the time of transmission ( causality constraint ) , whereas theoretical performance bounds are often determined for non - causally adapted output powers [ [ lita1]]-[[lit5 ] ] .",
    "the eh from the environment ( e.g. , solar or wind ) is an intermittent process , which can be mitigated by using wireless power transfer ( wpt ) , based on far - field radio frequency ( rf ) radiation from a distant energy source .",
    "if the same signal is used for simultaneous energy and information transfer , a fundamental tradeoff exists between energy transfer and the achievable rate , as has been shown , e.g. , for the noisy channel [ [ lita3 ] ] , the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) broadcast channel [ [ lita4 ] ] , and multiple - access channel ( mac ) [ [ lita5 ] ] .    in this paper",
    ", we study an eh network that consists of a base station ( bs ) and multiple eh users ( ehus ) , where the bs broadcasts rf energy to the ehus over the downlink , and the ehus send information simultaneously to the bs over the uplink mac ( denoted here as the eh mac ) .",
    "such a scenario is relevant , e.g. , for sensor networks operating in hostile or inaccessible environments .",
    "only a few existing works consider similar systems [ [ litb2 ] ] , [ [ litb3 ] ] , and only [ [ litb3 ] ] studies the achievable rates of the ehus in block fading channels . in [ [ litb3 ] ] , the ehus send their information to the bs using time - division - multiple - access ( tdma ) , and , for each fading state , the ehus sum - rate is maximized by jointly optimizing the duration of the downlink interval allocated to the bs and the duration of the uplink intervals allocated to each of the ehus .    the system model considered in this paper is more general : ( a ) the ehus are allowed to send their information simultaneously to the bs , instead of via tdma .",
    "( b ) the ehus are equipped with eh batteries that can store energy over multiple fading states ( slots ) .",
    "( c ) the bs transmit power may change from slot to slot subject to a long - term average power constraint . assuming only availability of causal channel state information ( csi ) , we propose online rate and power allocation strategies for the ehus and the bs so as to maximize the average achievable rates in the eh mac .",
    "the network consists of one bs and @xmath0 ehus .",
    "the time is divided into slots of equal duration , whose total number @xmath1 satisfies @xmath2 . the @xmath3th ehu s uplink and downlink channels",
    "are affected by independent channel fading and additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with power @xmath4 .",
    "the fading in each channel is a stationary and ergodic random process , and follows the block fading model ( i.e. , they are constant in each slot but change from one slot to the next ) . in slot @xmath5",
    ", the fading power gains of the @xmath3th ehu s uplink and downlink channels are denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . for convenience , these gains are normalized by the awgn power , such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the bs and ehus operate in half - duplex mode .",
    "two multiplexing schemes for energy and information transfer are possible :    \\(1 ) time - division information and power transfer ( tdt ) : here , the uplink and downlink transmissions occur in the same frequency band but in different time slots .",
    "thus , the @xmath5th time slot is dedicated to either uplink or downlink transmission .",
    "the uplink and downlink channels are assumed reciprocal , i.e. , @xmath10 . to mathematically model tdt",
    ", we introduce a  scheduling \" variable @xmath11 , defined as @xmath12    \\(2 ) frequency - division information and power transfer ( fdt ) : here , the uplink and downlink transmissions occur simultaneously but in two different frequency bands .",
    "thus , in the @xmath5th time slot , simultaneous information and energy transmission is performed in the uplink and downlink , respectively . in this case , the power gains @xmath13 and @xmath14 are assumed to be independent .",
    "the downlink may require negligible spectrum resources ( e.g. , a `` power carrier '' sinusoid may be used ) .",
    "the bs output power in the @xmath5th slot is @xmath15 .",
    "two types of constraints are imposed on @xmath15 : ( a ) a peak power constraint , @xmath16 , and ( b ) an average power constraint , @xmath17   \\leq p_{avg}$ ] for tdt and @xmath18 \\leq p_{avg}$ ] for fdt , where @xmath19 $ ] denotes the time average .",
    "each ehu has a battery that stores the harvested rf energy with a power conversion efficiency coefficient @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the amount of power harvested into the battery of ehu @xmath3 at time slot @xmath5 is given by @xmath22    let @xmath23 denote the available power in the battery of ehu @xmath3 at the beginning of slot @xmath5 , and let the battery s storage capacity be unlimited , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "however , due to the inefficiency of the power amplifier ( pa ) of the ehu , the power transmitted by the ehu is assumed to be @xmath25 times the power actually extracted ( consumed ) from its battery , where @xmath26 is the pa efficiency coefficient ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "therefore , when ehu @xmath3 transmits a codeword in slot @xmath5 , the battery can supply at most a transmit power of @xmath28 in that slot . as a result",
    ", the desired transmit power of the codeword , @xmath29 , may not be available in the ehu s battery , in which case , the codeword is transmitted with some lower power , @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "actually , the codeword is transmitted with power @xmath32 where @xmath33 such that the power extracted from the battery is @xmath34 . at the end of slot @xmath5 ,",

    "we define a multidimensional plane @xmath43 , where @xmath44 are an arbitrary set of constants that satisfy @xmath45 .",
    "due to the convexity of the capacity region ( [ rav2 ] ) , for given @xmath46 , one point of the boundary surface of @xmath36 is found as the solution of the following optimization problem @xmath47 the entire boundary surface of @xmath36 is obtained by solving ( [ novrav1 ] ) for all possible @xmath46 , such that @xmath45 .    without loss of generality ,",

    "the achievability of the rate in ( [ rav9 ] ) is as follows : given @xmath52 , @xmath49 , the ehu @xmath3 in time slot @xmath5 transmits a gaussian distributed codeword ( comprised of infinitely many symbols and spanning one time slot ) , which carries @xmath53 bits / symb .",
