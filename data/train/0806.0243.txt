    "after the seminal work of bak , tang and wiesenfeld @xcite , sandpile models have been found to be a very helpful framework to study self - organized criticality ( soc ) .",
    "soc is believed to be the underlying reason for the scaling laws seen in a number of natural phenomena @xcite .",
    "further investigations showed that btw sandpile model has an abelian property and was renamed abelian sandpile model ( asm ) @xcite .",
    "the model is still the simplest , most studied model of soc , in which many analytical results has been derived . for a good review",
    "@xcite .",
    "extensive work has been done on this model , analytical and computational . to name a few",
    ", one can list the works by dhar @xcite , where the probabilities of some height cluster were computed . in @xcite , dhar computed the number of recurrent configurations and showed that all occur with equal probability . later , in @xcite , majumdar and dhar calculated the probabilities of occurrence of some specific clusters , known as weakly allowed clusters ( wac s ) .",
    "the simplest of these clusters is one - site height one cluster .",
    "the probabilities of other one - site clusters with height above 1 was computed in ref .",
    "there are many other analytical results , among them one can mention the results on boundary correlations of height variables and effect of boundary conditions @xcite , on presence of dissipation in the model @xcite , on field theoretical approaches @xcite , on finite size corrections @xcite and many other results@xcite .    in asm ,",
    "the height variables take only integer values .",
    "however there are some other models in which the height variables can take real values @xcite . in zhang model , which is not abelian ,",
    "when a site topples all of its energy ( height ) is distributed among its neighbors . on the other hand the model introduced by gabrielov , called abelian avalanche model ( aa model ) and the model introduced by ghaffari et .",
    "have the abelian property . in @xcite a continuous version of asm",
    "is considered on a square lattice and many of its different properties are studied .",
    "when we let the heights be real number , naturally the components of toppling matrix could be real too .",
    "in this paper we consider continuous asm @xcite and change different components of toppling matrix . we will do it in a way to add spatial asymmetries to the model .",
    "two specific asymmetries are considered , one is to introduce a preferred direction .",
    "the second is to introduce elliptical asymmetry .",
    "the first one is related to directed sandpile model and the second , as we shall see results naturally from the original btw model .",
    "we have derived the probability distribution of height variables and also avalanche distributions . also the field theory associated with these models are considered .",
    "the new models are still critical and show scaling relations .    in the next section we first review the continuous asm .",
    "next we consider the effects of a perturbation that introduces a preferred direction in the model . in the forth section",
    "we introduce ellipticity in the model and derive many properties of such a system .",
    "the continuous abelian sandpile model ( casm ) on a square lattice is defined in @xcite .",
    "consider a @xmath0 square lattice .",
    "to each site @xmath1 a _ continuous _ height variable , @xmath2 is assigned , where without loss of generality we assume these variables are in [ 0,4 ) ( in the original paper it was taken to be in [ 0,1 ) ) .",
    "the evolution rules consist of the following rules :    \\1 ) at each time step , a site is selected randomly and an amount of sand is added to it and other height variables are unchanged .",
    "the amount of sand added to the site is a random real number in the interval @xmath3\\in[0,4)$ ] .",
    "the distribution function could be any function , but for simplicity we take it to be uniform on the interval @xmath3 $ ] . if height remains below four , the new configuration is stable and we go to the next time step .",
    "\\2 ) if height of the sand at that site becomes equal to or greater than four , the site becomes unstable and topples in the following way : it gives an amount of sand with height one to either of its neighbors .",
    "in other words @xmath4 for all @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the toppling matrix of the casm and is defined as @xmath7    so if the height of a site is @xmath8 , after toppling its height will be @xmath9 and the heights of neighbors will be added by the amount 1 . as a result of this toppling , some of the neighbors may become unstable and an avalanche may occur .    it has been shown in @xcite that there is a ( many to one ) mapping from configurations in casm to configurations in asm , which preserves the dynamics , therefore the new model reproduce most of the interesting features of asm .",
    "also it is shown that the probability distribution is piecewise constant .",
    "the probability of finding a site with height @xmath10 with @xmath11 is equal with @xmath12 , the probability of finding a site with height @xmath13 in the usual asm .",
    "the claims were proved and were in agreement with simulations .",
    "as the heights are continuous , we can take other integer parameters of the model to be real .",
    "this has been done to the dissipation parameter in the model@xcite .",
    "the probability distribution is found when there exist dissipation with different ( real ) values in @xcite .",
    "yet there are some other parameters which are integer in the original model , but may be taken to be real in the new model . in this paper",
    "we consider the amount of sand transferred to the neighbors and let it take different real values and see how the properties of the model are changed .",
    "one of the easiest modifications to the toppling matrix is to introduce a preferred direction , that is ; sand grains are more likely to move to left rather than right .",
    "such modification is also studied in the usual asm @xcite , but as the toppling matrix components have integer values , the only possibility is to send two sand grains to left and nothing to right .",
    "the same can be done in the vertical direction .",
    "if this is the case , then the toppling matrix will be upper triangular and all the configurations will be recurrent @xcite . however , in our model we are able to control the amount of directedness : when a site is toppled , then @xmath14 grains of sand move to left and @xmath15 grains of sand move to right",
    ". clearly @xmath16 corresponds to the usual asm and @xmath17 corresponds to the case mentioned above , provided we add both horizontal and vertical directedness .",

    "the probability distribution of finding different heights is sketched in figure 1 for some different values of @xmath22 when both directions are directed .",
    "as we see , still we have the same step - like pattern as in the case of undirected casm .",
    "some new small steps have appeared which have the length proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "as @xmath22 becomes larger , these steps become longer and little by little the original pattern fades away . at @xmath17 probability distribution becomes uniform , as it is expected @xcite .",
    "also the avalanche distribution is studied in this model .",
    "system sizes from 64 to 1024 has been investigated . starting with a lattice of randomly distributed heights @xmath23 ,",
    "the system is evolved to reach steady state .",
    "after that , we begin the measurements .",
    "the measurements are averaged over about @xmath24 avalanches .",
    "we studied two characteristics of an avalanche ( though we bring the result of one of them ) : the total number of toppling events is called the size @xmath25 of an avalanche and the number of distinct toppled lattice sites which is denoted by @xmath26 , . because a particular lattice site may topple several times , the number of toppling events exceeds the number of distinct toppled lattice sites , i.e. , @xmath27 , except when the system is fully directed in both directions in which case we have @xmath28 . in the critical steady state",
    "the corresponding probability distributions should obey power - law behavior characterized by exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30 : @xmath31    ( 200,100)(0,0 )    ( 55,0)@xmath18(220,0)@xmath19(383,0)@xmath21    ( 200,80)(20,0 )    ( 50,80)@xmath32(250,80)@xmath32 ( 205,25)@xmath33(415,25)@xmath33 ( 130,0)@xmath18 ( 330,0)@xmath19    figure 2 displays the obtained results for the distribution @xmath34 for different system sizes and three different values of @xmath35 when the both directions are directed .",
    "a power - law fit to the straight portion of these curves yields the exponents @xmath32 .",
    "figure 3 shows a plot of the exponents @xmath32 vs @xmath33 for @xmath18 and @xmath36 .",
    "this allows us to extract the exponent @xmath37 .",
    "as example , for the cases shown in figure 3 , it turns out to be : @xmath38 for @xmath18 and @xmath39 for @xmath19 , though the error bars are quite big and we do not have reliable results at hand .",
    "it is worth to mention that for small values of @xmath25 , the magnitude of slope is less comparing with the one associated with greater values of @xmath25 which is due to finite size of lattice .",
    "it is seen that still the system is critical and self - organized .",
    "there is no characteristic length in the model and finite size scaling is clearly observed from figure 2 . the exponent @xmath29 seems to increase as @xmath22 becomes greater which could be expected from the known behavior of directed sandpile model .    in the continuum limit",
    ", we may assign an action to the theory . as in the steady state , only recurrent configurations appear , and they appear with equal probability , the partition function is simply equal with the total number of recurrent configurations , that is , the determinant of toppling matrix .",
    "such determinants could be written in terms of integration over grassman variables : @xmath40 in this way the action of the theory may be obtained .",
    "if lattice spacing is small , one can go to continuum limit and find a field theoretic action for the theory . in the case of usual asm",
    "the action turns out to be the @xmath41 logarithmic conformal theory action @xcite : @xmath42 for the theory defined above , the action is more or less the same , but there are some added terms due to directedness : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant proportional to @xmath22 with dimension of length .",
    "this new term grows under renormalization group , therefore the large scale properties of the model is given by the fully directed model .",
    "in the previous section , it was supposed that the lattice has a preferred direction . the field associated with",
    "this deformation was a relevant one and hence we expected the theory show different characteristics on large scales .",
    "also the toppling matrix was not symmetric : the amount of sand transferred from site @xmath45 to the site @xmath46 is not necessarily equal with the amount of sand transferred from @xmath46 to @xmath45 .",
    "therefore one can not apply the burning test to the model .",
    "however it is possible to modify the toppling matrix in the following way so that it remains symmetric and , as we shall see , the added term to the action would not be relevant .",
    "we assume that the vertical links can carry an amount of sand equal to @xmath15 and the horizontal links can carry an amount of sand equal with @xmath14 ( @xmath47 ) . in this way",
    "the total amount of sand removed from a toppled site is 4 and the mass of sand is conserved . as we see the new toppling matrix is symmetric , but in real space , @xmath48 direction is quite different from @xmath49 direction , in fact",
    "; we have added some ellipticity to the system and therefore it does not have full rotational symmetry , however this deformation preserves the scale symmetry .",
    "if we go back to the original btw paper @xcite , we observe that elliptical asymmetry naturally could arise in their model . in their paper , btw first define a one dimensional model and using a specific transformation , express it in some other parameters .",
    "the same is done to a two dimensional version of the model to arrive at btw model , however it could easily be observed that if we apply the same transformation to the two dimensional model , we will not arrive at the btw model , instead we arrive at a model with elliptical asymmetry .",
    "let s explain it in more details . in the one dimensional model , an ordered array of heights @xmath50 is considered .",
    "sand grains enter from left and leave from right . if the difference of the heights of two neighbors become more than two a sand grain moves to right .",
    "the slope parameters @xmath51 are defined as @xmath52 .",
    "then as result of `` toppling '' at site @xmath45 we will have @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the generalization to two dimensions would be to define the slope parameters as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the height variables right and down to the site @xmath45 respectively .",
    "the dynamics would be if the slope parameter of a cite ( mean value of the slope there ) is more than a threshold , one sand grain moves to right and one sand grain moves downward .",
    "the dynamics in terms of @xmath58 variables would be @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are the slope parameters of right - up and left - down next nearest neighbors of the site @xmath45 .",

    "again system shows finite size scaling and is critical , but there is not a remarkable variations in the exponents like @xmath29 as @xmath22 is changed .",
    "possibly they belong to identical universality class .      in casm with no asymmetries ,",
    "one is able to find the probability of having any height in the interval @xmath69 $ ] .",

    "therefore , the total number of such configurations could be obtained by counting the number of spanning trees in which site @xmath45 is a leaf . in the modified model the same arguments holds for @xmath70 , because the burning test still works and any site with @xmath70 has to be a leaf in the corresponding spanning tree .",
    "note that as we have links with weight @xmath14 , the sites with @xmath71 $ ] may not be a leaf .",
    "similar to the way we find the probability of one in asm , we modify the the weights of the toppling matrix to ensure that the site @xmath45 is a leaf .",
    "this modification of weights is only done on a finite number of lattice bonds , therefore the probabilities corresponding to these local restrictions can be calculated in terms of finite dimensional determinant .",
