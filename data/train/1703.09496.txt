    "alice , a large ion collider experiment , is specially optimized to study the properties of the deconfined state of quarks and gluons known as the `` quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) '' . in non - central heavy - ion collisions , strong parity violation coupled with a strong magnetic field leads to a charge separation along the system s angular momentum direction resulting in the `` chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) ''  @xcite .",
    "this effect has been studied by the star experiment at rhic for different beam energies @xmath0= 7.7 - 200 gev  @xcite and by the alice at lhc at @xmath0 = 2.76 tev  @xcite . in view of this , voloshin  @xcite proposed a multi - particle correlator @xmath1 to observe cme , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 are the azimuthal angles of the particles @xmath4 , @xmath5 , respectively and @xmath6 is the reaction plane angle .",
    "the alice collaboration investigated the charge separation effect by studying the centrality dependence of this multi - particle correlator for the different charge combinations such as opposite sign charge pairs ( + - ) and same sign charge pairs ( + + , - - ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the correlation for same sign charge pairs increases as one moves from the central to peripheral collisions .",
    "[ fig1 ]  @xcite also displays the star data points , which exhibits the similar trend .",
    "[ h ]     centrality dependence of the correlator for same sign charged pairs ( red colour ) and opposite sign charged pairs ( blue colour ) @xcite . ]    for this analysis , the alice time projection chamber ( tpc ) covering the pseudorapidity region , @xmath7 is used to reconstruct the charged particle tracks and the vzero detector is used to measure the collision centrality .",
    "the accepted events are divided into various centrality classes from 20 - 30@xmath8 to 60 - 70@xmath8 .",
    "the analysis is performed in pseudorapidity coverage @xmath9 and 0.2 @xmath10 5 gev / c .",
    "to investigate the localized charge separation on event - by - event basis , the sdm is used , which is similar to the sliding window method  @xcite used for charged - neutral fluctuations in pb - pb collisions at 158 a gev at sps  @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the observable @xmath11 is measured and defined as :    @xmath12    where , n@xmath13 and n@xmath14 are the numbers of positively and negatively charged particles on the left side of the dumbbell respectively , whereas n@xmath15 and n@xmath16 are the numbers of positively and negatively charged particles on the right side of the dumbbell respectively .",
    "the whole azimuthal plane is scanned by sliding the dumbbell of @xmath17 = @xmath18 in steps of @xmath19 = @xmath20 and calculating the fraction @xmath11 in each event to extract the maximum value of @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath11 can also be calculated for different centrality intervals ranging from 20 - 30@xmath8 to 60 - 70@xmath8 .",
    "a sample of about 1 million minimum bias events of pb - pb collision data at @xmath0 = 2.76 tev were analysed .",
    "the @xmath11 distributions are obtained for different centralities using the sdm and also obtained by placing the dumbbell at randomly chosen azimuth in each event for the similar centrality intervals .",
    "@xmath11 distribution obtained from randomly placed dumbbells shows a gaussian distribution , which peaks @xmath21 1 but the one obtained using sdm shifts towards higher @xmath11 values and this shift is more for semi - central events as compared to those for central events .",
    "some of the semi - central events have been observed with much larger @xmath11 values , which indicates that the positive charged particles are on one side of the dumbbell and the negative charged particles are on the other side of the dumbbell .",
    "the percentage of such events increases with decreasing collision centrality .",
    "further studies on monte carlo generators without the cme ( e.g. hijing ) are needed to investigate any biases of this method .",
