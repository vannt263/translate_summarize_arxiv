    "after more than 30 years , the charmonium system continues to provide an important laboratory for the study of the strong force .",
    "this brief review reflects the wide scope of strong force physics that is accessible in the charmonium system .",
    "the physics impact of the results presented here ranges from tests of lattice qcd calculations to our understanding of bound gluonic states ( glueballs ) to an evaluation of models of the spin - spin component of the @xmath6 potential to our ability to calculate strong radiative and relativistic corrections . in small increments ,",
    "the charmonium system has , over time , given us a variety of opportunities to add to our global understanding of the strong force .",
    "the charmonium system can be accessed experimentally in a number of complementary ways .",
    "this review covers recent results obtained by three different methods .",
    "( 1 )  the cleo - c experiment at cornell university collects data at an @xmath7 collider ( cesr ) that has a center of mass energy in the charmonium region .",
    "cleo - c has recently collected a total and final sample of 27  million @xmath8 decays .",
    "many other charmonium states can be reached and studied through transitions of the @xmath8 .",
    "( 2,3 )  the belle ( at kekb ) and babar ( at slac ) experiments run at @xmath7 colliders with center of mass energies in the bottomonium region . at these higher energies , among other possibilities , one can ( 2 )  study the collisions of two photons radiated from the @xmath7 , where the center of mass energy of the two photons is in the charmonium region ; or one can ( 3 )  study charmonium states produced in @xmath9 decays .",
    "results from bes - ii are not covered in this review .",
    "it should be noted , however , that bes - iii is on the horizon and will soon increase , substantially , the world sample of @xmath2 and @xmath8 decays .",
    "radiative transitions in the charmonium system have recently been the subject of both lattice qcd calculations  @xcite and effective field theory techniques  @xcite .",
    "key among these are the magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transitions @xmath11 and @xmath12 . using a combination of inclusive and exclusive techniques ,",
    "the cleo - c experiment has recently measured @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xcite , reconciling experiment with theory .",
    "the line shape of the @xmath1 in these m1 transitions was found to play a crucial role . because the width of the @xmath1 is relatively large",
    ", the energy dependences of the phase space term and the matrix element distort the line shape ( see figure  [ fig : etac]a ) .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty in this line shape represents the largest systematic error in the branching ratios .",
    "both m1 transitions are larger than previous measurements due to a combination of a larger @xmath1 width and an accounting for the asymmetry in the line shape .",
    "current lattice qcd calculations of the @xmath15 hyperfine splitting ( @xmath16 ) have mev - level sensitivity .",
    "the mass of the @xmath1 carries the dominant experimental error in checking these calculations . as of 2006 , there was a @xmath17 discrepancy between @xmath1 mass measurements made from @xmath10 ( averaging @xmath18 ) and from @xmath19 or @xmath20 production ( averaging @xmath21 )  @xcite .",
    "the cleo - c analysis referenced above  @xcite suggests that the solution to this problem may lie in the line shape of the @xmath1 in the m1 radiative transitions ( see figure  [ fig : etac]a ) .",
    "when no distortion in the line shape is used , the resulting @xmath1 mass is consistent with other measurements from m1 transitions ( @xmath22 , statistical error only ) ; however , when a distorted line shape is taken into account , the mass is consistent with those from @xmath19 or @xmath20 production ( @xmath23 , statistical error only ) .",
    "recent measurements of the @xmath1 mass in @xmath19 production by the belle experiment are consistent with this general picture . in an analysis of @xmath24 ,",
    "belle measures a mass of @xmath25 ( see figure  [ fig : etac]b )  @xcite mass is slightly higher . ] .",
    "an @xmath1 mass of @xmath26 is reported in a belle analysis of @xmath27 , where @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "both measurements are consistent with the higher @xmath1 mass .",
    "the @xmath30 state of positronium , ortho - positronium , decays almost exclusively to @xmath31 and has played an important role in precision tests of qed .",
    "the analogous decay in the quarkonium system , @xmath29 , has recently been reported by the cleo - c experiment  @xcite .",
    "like ortho - positronium for qed , this @xmath2 decay furthers our understanding of qcd , especially when compared to decays like @xmath32 , @xmath33 , or @xmath34 due to similarities at the parton level  @xcite .",
    "excluding backgrounds from @xmath35 and carefully accounting for backgrounds with missing photons ( e.g. , @xmath36 ) , cleo - c measures @xmath37 with a significance greater than @xmath38 . as part of the same analysis , a 90% c.l .",
    "upper limit of @xmath39 is placed on the product branching fraction @xmath40 .",
    "like the decay @xmath29 discussed above , decays of the @xmath3 to two photons provide additional analogies to the positronium system . masses and wavefunctions cancel in the ratio of @xmath41 to @xmath42 two - photon widths .",
    "thus , @xmath43 to leading order for both positronium and charmonium .",
    "since the lowest order prediction is well - understood , experimental measurements of @xmath44 probe strong radiative and relativistic corrections in the charmonium system .",
    "belle has recently measured the product of @xmath3 branching fractions times two - photon widths of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the `` formation '' process @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a hadronic decay mode of the @xmath3 .",
    "the two - photon widths are obtained by dividing by external determinations of @xmath49 . when @xmath50 ( see figure  [ fig : chic]a ) , the belle value is @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath52 , the belle values are @xmath53 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "cleo - c has recently measured the same quantity in the `` decay '' process @xmath54 ( see figure  [ fig : chic]b ) , obtaining two - photon widths after dividing by external determinations of @xmath55 and the total widths of the @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the ratio in this case is @xmath56 , consistent with the determination from the `` formation '' processes .",
    "the world - average value of @xmath44 , including the values presented here , is now @xmath57 .",
    "radiative decays of the @xmath2 have often been used as a gluon - rich environment in which one can search for bound states of gluons ( glueballs ) .",
    "the successful theoretical interpretation of these searches , however , relies on an understanding of the decays @xmath59 , where the @xmath60 states are complicated by the fact that they are likely mixtures of conventional states and a glueball .",
    "structurally similar to these @xmath2 decays , the decays @xmath61 do not suffer the same complications since the quark model interpretations of the @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 mesons are well - established .",
    "therefore , these @xmath3 radiative decays provide an independent and complementary @xmath65-annihilation decay that can be used to validate theoretical techniques .",
    "cleo - c has recently observed the decays @xmath66 and @xmath67 with branching fractions of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "pertubative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions , however , are more than an order of magnitude smaller  @xcite .",
    "a resolution to this anomaly has yet to be found .",
    "because the masses of the @xmath3 are already well - measured , improving the mass measurement of the @xmath4 yields important information regarding the hyperfine splitting of the @xmath70  states .",
    "the hyperfine splitting of the @xmath70  states is in turn sensitive to the form of the @xmath6 potential . in particular , for the @xmath70 states , if there is no spin - spin contribution from the confinement part of the potential , it is expected that the hyperfine splitting will be zero to lowest order .",
    "cleo - c has recently made a precision measurement of the mass of the @xmath4 in the processes @xmath71 , where the @xmath1 decay is either reconstructed inclusively or through a series of exclusive modes  @xcite . in the inclusive analysis , cleo - c measures @xmath72 , while in the exclusive analysis @xmath73 . combining these results",
    ", cleo - c obtains @xmath74 . to determine the hyperfine splitting , one can compare this result with the spin - weighted centroid of the @xmath3 masses , @xmath75 .",
    "the difference is @xmath76 , thus the hyperfine splitting of the @xmath70 states is consistent with zero masses ; see the discussion in  @xcite . ] .",
    "the @xmath5 , the first radial excitation of the @xmath1 remains fairly elusive .",
    "progress has been made , however . at babar , the @xmath5",
    "was observed in @xmath9 decays in its decay mode to @xmath77  @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : etacprime]a ) . combining this result with an earlier inclusive result , one can determine the first absolute branching fraction of the @xmath5 , @xmath78 .",
    "this is significantly smaller than the corresponding decay of the @xmath1 , @xmath79 .",
    "if one could measure the rate of the process @xmath80 one could now infer the two - photon width of the @xmath5 , a quantity that is theoretically clean .",
    "unfortunately , the two - photon process is complicated by interference effects between the @xmath5 and the continuum .",
    "belle , however , can use this process to determine the mass and width of the @xmath5 ( see figure  [ fig : etacprime]b ) as @xmath81 and @xmath82  @xcite change when interference effects are included , but the values are consistent within errors . ] .",
    "the decay @xmath83 remains the only observed decay mode of the @xmath5 .",
    "while the cleo - c and babar programs have ended , belle continues .",
    "in addition , the bes - ii experiment at the bepc @xmath7 collider has recently been upgraded to bes - iii .",
    "the bepc collider will provide an unprecedented luminosity at center of mass energies in the charmonium region , and we expect bes - iii , carrying on in the tradition of bes - ii and cleo - c , to greatly expand our knowledge of the charmonium system",
