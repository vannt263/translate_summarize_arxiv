    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has achieved a great triumph from its discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite in 2012 at 8 tev center - of - mass energy .",
    "the next big goal of the lhc running with a higher center - of - mass energy is to discover new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . with hundreds of experimental searches with many combinations of objects ,",
    "there is still no sign of new physics .",
    "one simple explanation is that the lhc has not reached its full colliding energy as well as luminosity .",
    "some new particles may evade the current searches because it is too heavy or buried in the sm background .",
    "we could be more patient and wait for the lhc run 2 to tell us the physics at the tev scale .",
    "on the other hand , one may wonder whether the existing search strategy at the lhc is drawing water with a sieve .",
    "some non - trivial signatures may require non - standard search strategies and deserves us attention to identify and search for them .",
    "a big fraction of existing lhc searches have been concentrated on resonances or  bump hunting \" .",
    "for instance , the higgs boson as a di - photon or four - lepton resonance is one of the good examples .",
    "the search for resonances in models beyond the sm will continue to be the major task in the high energy frontier .",
    "however , sometimes due to some selection rule , new physics may not show up as a resonance , but instead has a sign of a suppressed event rate around the new particle mass .",
    "the new particle may then manifest itself as a  _ dip _ \" in terms of invariant masses of some objects . in this paper",
    ", we try to systematically identify the cases for a new particle to behave as a dip at colliders .",
    "the easiest way to obtain a dip in kinematic distributions is to have interference of two or more particles . even in the sm",
    ", the @xmath1 has a faint dip before the resonance ( the @xmath2 boson ) location .",
    "one could establish the existence of the @xmath2 boson at the venus experiment of tristan  @xcite with a center - of - mass energy up to 64 gev after the resonance discovery of the @xmath2 boson at the ua-1/2 of cern spps in 1983 .",
    "similarly , one could have interference among @xmath3 , @xmath2 and a new @xmath4 to have a dip structure in the di - muon or di - tau invariant mass distribution before the bump at the @xmath4 mass . in this paper",
    ", we will provide one example of @xmath4 s with an obvious dip plus bump structure .",
    "a more interesting way is how to obtain only a dip structure without a bump , which will be the focus of our paper . for three particle interactions of a new particle with two sm particles",
    ", one can translate this question as under what conditions one can have a vanishing vertex when all three particle mass on - shell , but a non - vanishing vertex when one or more particles mass off - shell .",
    "one of the famous examples is the landau - yang theorem  @xcite , which states that one massive spin - one particle can not decay into two identical massless spin - one particles .",
    "this theorem means that when all three spin - one particles are mass on - shell , the interaction vanishes . however , when one of the three particles is off - shell , the interaction is not zero .    to identify more cases satisfying the condition to provide a dip",
    ", we will use both spinor - helicity method ( in section  [ subsec : spinor - helicity ] ) and operator analysis to systematically cover all cases with particle spins below two . for three particle interactions ,",
    "we have found three interesting cases for providing a mass - on - shell interaction : one massive gauge boson with two identical scalars ; one massless gauge boson with two different scalars ; one massive gauge boson with two identical massless gauge bosons .",
    "we will first use the spinor - helicity method to simply show that those three cases satisfy vanishing mass - on - shell but non - vanishing mass - off - shell matrix element .    then in section  [ subsec : mass - on - shell - dip ] , for every case we introduce one effective operator to illustrate whether the dip structure shows up at the lhc or not .",
    "we point out the subtleties of choosing the correct massive gauge boson propagators associated with an unstable particle . for an unstable particle",
    ", a complex mass should be used to define its mass on - shell condition .",
    "the same complex mass also shows up in this unstable massive particle propagator . as a result ,",
    "the zero in the numerator and the zero in the denominator cancel and leave a contact - like interaction without a dip .",
    "for the case related to the landau - yang theorem in section  [ sec : case - iii ] , we point out the interesting collider signatures for the fermion - phobic @xmath4 .",
    "we provide a detailed analysis of @xmath4 productions from gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "the amplitudes in @xmath5 due to the new @xmath4 as well as its interference with the standard qcd process are evaluated . if the same @xmath4 couples to the top quark axial - vectorially , the @xmath4 may give rise to observable excess in the large @xmath6 tail .",
    "this is because the effective amplitude resembles a higher - dimensional operator with the top pair .    in section  [ sec : form - factor ]",
    ", we explore another way to generate a dip structure by constructing a zero in the vertex form factor of the time - like momentum transfer . as a concrete example , we show that a heavy scalar coupling to two gluons can have a zero in the interaction form factor .",
    "we use this form factor to demonstrate the existence of the dip signature , although a bigger bump may also appear at a much higher center - of - mass energy away from the dip location .    in section",
    "[ sec : dip - bump ] , we review the `` standard way '' of realizing a dip that occurs due to destructive interference between resonances . such a dip is located in the side band of the new particle when the off - resonance amplitudes from various channels delicately cancel each other .",
    "therefore , the dip is always accompanied with a nearby bump of a resonance .    in this article , we do not address the interesting case of the radiation amplitude zero in certain processes at a specific scattering angle , where the differential cross section vanishes .",
    "for instance , one has the sm process @xmath7@xcite , the high @xmath8 chargino - neutralino production of susy@xcite , and the lepto - quark process@xcite .",
    "usually the radiation amplitude zero does not maintain zero when going beyond the tree level , and its detection requires extreme angular resolution in the subprocess frame .",
    "in this section , we first use the spinor - helicity formulas to find all possible cases with a a vanishing mass - on - shell vertex among three particles .",
    "we then discuss whether one can have a dip structure based on specific operator examples .      for three particle interactions ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to spins below two .",
    "if all particles are bosons ( we have not found interesting examples for fermion interactions ) , we have combinations of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the cases of @xmath13 and @xmath11 ( for instance , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) have non - zero matrix elements when all three particles are on - shell .    for the remaining two cases , @xmath10 and @xmath12 , we use the spinor - helicity formalism  @xcite to find the cases with zero matrix elements when all three particles are on - shell .",
    "we follow the notation in the textbook@xcite . in this formalism , the four - vector momentum @xmath16 is replaced by a product of two spinors : @xmath17 .",

    "for massless photon , one can use the requirement of @xmath21 to specify the two different polarizations , which are ^- _ = , ^+ _ = , for arbitrary @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which represent the freedom inherent in a gauge theory . for many massless vectors , @xmath24 ,",
    "one has ^+_i",

    "if the vertex contains only @xmath25 massless gauge fields under the same gauge symmetry , one has the conservation of momenta such that one can have the freedom to choose @xmath26 arbitrary @xmath27 s .",
    "for instance , one can prove that the amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath29 are zero by choosing @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "now , come back to our first case of @xmath32 .",
    "there are two interesting sub - cases .",
    "the first sub - case has a massive spin-1 particle and two identical spin-0 particles . because the bose symmetry between the two scalar momenta , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the matrix element should be proportional to @xmath35 , where we have defined all momenta to be out - going from the vertex .",
    "for an off - shell massive gauge boson , @xmath36 and we can have a non - zero matrix element .",
    "the second sub - case has a massless spin-1 particle and two different spin-0 particles .",
    "if the massless spin-1 particle is mass on - shell , we have @xmath37 to be light - like .",

    "the first one is obviously zero .",
    "the second one can be rewritten as @xmath41 . if one chooses @xmath42 , one can easily show that this matrix element is zero .",
    "a similar argument can show a vanishing value for @xmath43 . on the other hand ,",
