    "the abundance of lithium , @xmath2(li ) , in stellar photospheres is a useful diagnostic of a variety of phenomena related to the internal mixing near the stellar surface .",
    "it has been used as a crude clock for some low mass main sequence ( ms ) stars ( see @xcite for uses and limitations ) and to study non - standard , i.e. , non - convective , mixing processes in red giant ( rg ) stars ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , studies of ms stars suggest that the planet formation process may alter the stellar @xmath2(li )  early in the star s life by causing enhanced li - depletion ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) , which is supported theoretically",
    ". however , whether @xmath2(li )   of ms planet hosts truly differs from apparently planet - free stars after controlling for stellar ages , masses , etc .",
    "is still hotly debated ( e.g , @xcite , , @xcite ) . because the number of known rgs that host planets or other substellar companions ( sscs ) lags considerably behind the number of ms hosts , there is not much known about whether li in planet hosts is substantially different from non - planet hosts .",
    "ten rg planet hosts were included in the @xcite study of li and rotation in rgs , and the planet hosts did not show any unusual @xmath2(li ) .",
    "two ssc hosts were included in a contemporaneous study of @xmath2(li )  in open clusters , and these appear to have enhanced @xmath2(li )  @xcite .",
    "most recent studies comparing the abundance patterns of rg planet hosts and non - hosts have not included li in their analyses ( e.g. , and ) .    complicating any comparisons between ssc hosts and control populations are the difficulty in estimating accurate masses for rgs and the large dispersion of @xmath2(li )  seen in rgs  at least three orders of magnitude for `` normal '' rgs and two more orders of magnitude when including the rare li - rich stars .",
    "li - rich stars , generally considered to be those with @xmath2(li)@xmath4  dex , exceed the li abundances predicted by standard models , and the addition of non - standard mixing tends to predict lower @xmath2(li )  ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) except in special cases ( @xcite , , @xcite )",
    ". other physical properties of red giants that are associated with li - richness include fast rotation ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) and infrared excesses ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that high li , fast rotation , and infrared excess could all be plausibly explained by the engulfment of planets or brown dwarfs .",
    "at least one planet - hosting rg in the field is known to be li - rich @xcite .",
    "open clusters have historically been used to understand the mixing processes that affect the abundances of li and other elements during the red giant phase , especially to discern the mass dependence . mixing in rgs",
    "not only dilutes li but also alters the surface c , n , and o abundances and reduces @xmath0c/@xmath1c .",
    "while the first evidence of non - standard mixing in population  i stars was found for field rgs ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , @xcite was the first to study the mass dependence using open clusters .",
    "she found a positive correlation between @xmath0c/@xmath1c  and the cluster turn - off mass up to 2.2  @xmath5  but no correlation between @xmath2(li )  and the turn - off mass .",
    "found the same correlation between @xmath0c/@xmath1c  and turn - off mass and also identified a small grouping of massive stars with low @xmath0c/@xmath1c .",
    "they interpreted this as a signature of extra mixing taking place during the early - agb stage .",
    "extra mixing also occurs in low mass stars at the luminosity bump phase ( the stage when the h - burning shell encroaches on the region of the star that was well mixed by convection during first dredge - up ) where additional li depletion occurs via thermohaline mixing .",
    "evidence of this mixing is seen in the dichotomy of @xmath2(li )  in open clusters in the region of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) where red clump stars and first ascent stars overlap ( e.g. , @xcite , , @xcite , , @xcite )    open clusters were also instrumental in progressing our understanding of a mass - dependent li - depletion mechanism in ms stars , known as the li - dip .",
    "this feature was first found in the hyades @xcite , where ms stars in a very narrow temperature range show a large depletion in li compared to stars that are both hotter and cooler .",
    "@xcite showed that the mass at which the li - dip occurs increases with increasing metallicity .",
    "understanding the amount of li depletion on the main sequence is of course necessary for interpreting the abundances measured at later stages of evolution .",
    "the goal of this study is to test whether the presence of substellar companions affects the level of @xmath2(li )  observed during the red giant phase . given the complex evolution of li throughout a stars s life , we focused the study on three substellar companion - hosting rgs ( 2 planetary mass and 1 brown dwarf mass companion ) that are members of open clusters .",
    "cluster membership allows for a more precise estimate of the stellar masses and , importantly , the comparison to other rgs of nearly identical mass and composition , which provides a better opportunity for isolating effects due to the presence of companions .",
    "therefore , we also present @xmath2(li )  for 13 red giants in each cluster that are not known to host planets .",
    "we also measure @xmath0c/@xmath1c   and @xmath6  to explore possible differences in the stars mixing histories .",
    "most of the stars in this study come from , which describes their program for monitoring rgs in 13 open clusters for planetary companions .",
    "their sample includes 6 stars in ngc  2423 ( 3 , 43 , 240 , 73 , 20 , and 56 ) and 7 stars in ngc  4349 ( 127 , 174 , 53 , 168 , 203 , 5 , and 9 ) . in both clusters , a ssc was discovered around the brightest ( presumably most evolved ) star monitored in each cluster .",
    "two additional stars come from , who discovered three planet - hosting stars ( two ms stars and one rg ) among a large sample of m67 stars being monitored for companions .",
    "again , the planet was discovered around one of the most evolved stars monitored .",
    "m67 is one of the most well - studied open clusters and has a near - solar age and metallicity .",

    "its evolutionary stage appears to be intermediate to the other two stars analyzed in the cluster and only slightly less evolved than ngc  2423  15 .",
    "if the lower mass estimates are correct , then the star may have recently evolved through the luminosity bump , which could explain its higher @xmath2(li )   if thermohaline mixing took place at the luminosity bump ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this scenario , however , one would expect the similarly evolved comparison star ngc  2423  15 to also show high li . on the other hand , if the higher mass inferred from the cluster age is correct , then the star will transition to the core he burning stage without any thermohaline mixing taking place  as is evident by the lack of a bump feature in the isochrone in figure [ fig : cmds ] . in that case , the enriched li may be better explained as coming from an external source , such as planet engulfment .",
    "the @xmath2(li )  results in ngc  2423 could also be described as a bifurcation or bimodal distribution of @xmath2(li ) , which has also been seen in ngc  752 , ngc  3680 , and ic  4651 ( e.g. , @xcite , , @xcite , , @xcite ) .",
    "the rgs in these clusters all have masses @xmath101.81.9  @xmath5 , within the range of mass estimates for ngc  2423 but favoring the degenerate he - core case .",
    "one interpretation of the bifurcation is that it is discriminating between first ascent rgs ( high @xmath2(li ) ) and red clump stars ( low @xmath2(li ) ) that are occupying the same locus on the cmds @xcite .",
    "this interpretation was used by to argue that the rgs in ngc  3680 , which mostly show high @xmath2(li ) , are dominated by first ascent stars . however , since red clump stars should be more common than first ascent stars , argued that it was possible that the red clump stars in ngc  3680 were in fact the high @xmath2(li )  stars .",
    "these studies further complicate the interpretation of ngc  2423  3 and whether its high li is related to the presence of the planet or to its evolutionary stage",
    ".      the ngc  4349 rgs are almost certainly above the mass threshold for non - degenerate he cores .",
    "the most similar comparison star to the ssc host is star 174 , which is less evolved than the ssc host unless 174 is on the agb and 127 is on the rgb .",
    "star 127 s @xmath2(li )  exceeds 174 s even after accounting for the 0.15  dex uncertainty in the abundance , which suggests that the high li is significant .",
    "however , if star 127 is on the agb track and not the rgb track , it would be at the right luminosity to be undergoing an early - agb extra - mixing phase that could replenish its li .",
    "the evolutionary status of the other two comparison stars are more difficult to interpret .",
    "stars 5 and 9 have nearly identical colors and magnitude yet one has the lowest @xmath2(li )  and one the second largest @xmath2(li )  of the four stars observed .",
    "they fall on the region of the isochrone where it is most difficult to discriminate first ascent and clump stars .",
    "the higher @xmath2(li )  of star 9 may be because it is at the base of the rgb and has not yet completed first dredge - up , while star 5 is in the red clump and thus has undergone the most li depletion .",
    "if this interpretation is correct and the ssc host is an rgb star , than the high @xmath2(li )  of the ssc host may be significant and due to the presence of the companion .",
    "m67 s rgs are definitively in the degenerate he core mass regime , and the two rgs studied here have evolved beyond the luminosity bump .",
    "the bump can be seen in m67 s isochrone in figure [ fig : cmds ] at @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the li evolution of rgs in m67 is more complex than that of the other two clusters .",
    "in addition to the possible alterations to li at the luminosity bump , the rgs in m67 are also likely the evolved counterparts of li - dip stars .",
    "the li - dip refers to a feature seen when plotting @xmath2(li )  of main sequence stars in open clusters as a function of @xmath28 , and thus mass @xcite . for a narrow range of masses , @xmath2(li )  is considerable lower than stars that are slightly more or less massive . for solar metallicity ,",
    "this mass is @xmath104  @xmath5  @xcite .",

    "this could explain why the @xmath2(li )  of the literature m67 rgs ( see section [ sec : rgcomp ] ) all have higher @xmath2(li )  than our two stars if the literature stars all evolved from stars just outside of the li - dip .",
    "the comparison star in this work is nearly identical to the planet host in every way .",
