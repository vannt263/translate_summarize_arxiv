    "<S> _ discussion and conclusions. _ in this paper , we have proposed a new way of creating effective two - dimensional unconventional superconductivity by local moments on the conventional spin - singlet @xmath0-wave superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the non - collinear configurations of moments are essential to induce @xmath3-wave pairing . </S>",
    "<S> there is a hierarchical structure in energy scale , i.e. , the original @xmath0-wave energy gap and that of the induced @xmath3-wave superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> andreev bound states by a topological origin appear within the latter energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> even the chiral @xmath76-wave like pairing is realized by the non - coplanar configuration of moments , which shows the chiral majorana edge channel with linear dispersion and zero energy majorana bound states at the vortex cores . </S>",
    "<S> moreover it indicates that we can create various kinds of superconducting states by choosing appropriate configurations of moments . </S>",
    "<S> for example , by changing the distance between the moments , one can tune the magnitudes of effective transfer integrals and pair potentials . </S>",
    "<S> then , the anisotropy @xmath77 can be controlled to obtain the rich topological phases discussed in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> here we briefly discuss the effect of self - energy correction and spin fluctuation for legitimizing our approach and results . </S>",
    "<S> the self - energy correction due to the dynamical quantum fluctuation of spins can be estimated as @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the dimensionless coupling constant with @xmath81 being the exchange coupling between spins in the magnet , and @xmath82 the fermi energy of the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> this correction is tiny at small electron energy @xmath83 , and does not change the mini - gap structure . also we have confirmed numerically the robustness of the induced gap structure against the small ( static ) spin fluctuation as shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fluc ] in supplemental material  [ sec : fluc ] . </S>",
    "<S> though our model will simulate the interface of bulk superconductors and magnetic materials , we end with an account of another experimental realization of these proposals . to create intended patterns of magnetic moments </S>",
    "<S> , we can use atomic manipulation techniques using scanning tunneling microscopy .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the spin structure in organized magnetic impurities is also observed ,  @xcite although it is antiferromagnetic and can not be utilized for our proposal .    </S>",
