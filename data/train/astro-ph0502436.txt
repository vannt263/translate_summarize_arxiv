    "while the @xmath0cdm cosmological scenario has been quite successful in describing measurements of cosmological structures on large scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it seems to overpredict the number of galactic satellites by about an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy could be resolved by modifying dark matter  making it warm , self - interacting , or otherwise exotic to reduce the predicted amount of small - scale structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility is that star formation in low - mass haloes is suppressed by photoionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would mean that many small haloes are present by dark .",
    "the latter hypothesis is readily tested with gravitational lensing , which is sensitive to the distribution of both luminous and dark matter over a range of scales in galaxy haloes .",
    "strong gravitational lensing has long been known to probe galaxy mass distributions on kiloparsec scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and even to be sensitive to the fine graininess of stellar mass distributions ( microlensing ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , @xcite pointed out that lensing is also sensitive to structure on intermediate scales ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) .",
    "this effect , sometimes termed ` millilensing , ' could solve a long - standing problem in lens modeling .",
    "detailed mass models of quadruply - imaged lenses are quite successful at matching the relative positions of the images , but often fail to reproduce the relative fluxes .",
    "@xcite pointed out that intermediate - scale substructure could nicely explain the ` anomalous ' flux ratios in radio lenses , taking the troublesome lens b1422 + 231 as their example .",
    "later , @xcite connected this idea to the predictions of @xmath0cdm and suggested that the statistical distribution of lens flux ratios could be used to test the hypothesis that galaxies contain significant substructure .",
    "@xcite carried out the statistical test for seven quadruply - imaged quasars to infer that the fraction of galactic mass in substructure is @xmath3 per cent ( 90 per cent confidence ) , which seemed to match the amount of substructure expected for @xmath0cdm , and to rule out modified dark matter models .",
    "connecting observed flux ratio anomalies to inferences about dark matter requires a fairly long chain of logic , whose strength is still being assessed .",
    "the very first link is the identification of flux ratio anomalies .",
    "careful analysis of the lens mapping reveals model - independent relations between certain images in 4-image lenses with ` cusp ' or ` fold ' configurations , relations which can only be violated if the lens galaxy contains significant small - scale structure @xcite .",
    "as valuable as that analysis is , it only reveals which lens _ systems _ contain anomalies ; it does not pinpoint which individual _ images _ are anomalous .",
    "this issue is crucial because lens theory predicts fundamental differences in how positive- and negative - parity images are affected by small - scale structure @xcite , which offers a key test of the substructure hypothesis that may rule out competing explanations of flux ratio anomalies ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , the large number of substructures implied by @xmath0cdm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests the possibility that more than one image could be perturbed , but previous analyses have not determined whether that actually occurs . one goal of our analysis is to revisit models of flux ratio anomaly lenses to see if we can figure out which of the images are affected by substructure .",
    "another link in the chain of logic involves determining the length or mass scale associated with flux ratio anomalies . according to the substructure hypothesis ,",
    "the anomalies are caused by mass clumps in the range @xmath4@xmath5 , corresponding to a length scale of a few to tens of parsecs .",
    "however , violations of the cusp and fold relations really only indicate structure on the scale of the separation between images ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is typically no smaller than a few tenths of an arcsecond , or hundreds of parsecs .",
    "the difference in scale means that substructure can not yet be established as the only viable explanation for flux ratio anomalies ( e.g. , @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , even within the substructure hypothesis , comparisons between the predicted and inferred amount of substructure are very sensitive to scale .",
    "the size of the source quasar brings an additional scale into the problem .",
    "heuristically , a source ` feels ' lensing structure only on scales larger than itself . combining conventional wisdom about structure in lens galaxies with the standard model of quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is believed that quasar optical continuum light is very sensitive to both microlensing and millilensing ; that the optical broad emission lines are certainly sensitive to millilensing and may or may not be affected by microlensing ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; that the radio and mid - ir light can only be affected by millilensing ; and that the optical narrow emission lines should not be affected by any small - scale structure .",
    "measuring the flux ratios associated with several different source sizes could therefore provide a way to determine the substructure scale @xcite .",
    "@xcite used these ideas in a general way , selecting radio lenses in order to focus on millilensing ( and ignore microlensing ) .",
    "@xcite compared the optical continuum and broad line flux ratios for he  0435@xmath61223 to infer that there must be microlensing in that system , and maybe some millilensing as well .",
    "@xcite compared the optical narrow line flux ratios with the radio and mid - ir flux ratios for q2237@xmath70305 to find evidence for millilensing and place limits on the substructure mass scale .    despite this evidence for the value of working with different source sizes ,",
    "there has been no general study of source size effects in millilensing .",
    "the second main goal of our paper is to present a semi - analytic toy model that allows us to examine a wide range of finite source effects . assuming that any given flux ratio anomaly is caused by a single , isolated clump that can be modeled as an isothermal sphere is admittedly a toy model  but in the best sense of the term : a tool that not only reveals , but also elucidates , some interesting general principles .",
    "as we completed our work , we learned that @xcite recently considered the same toy model and derived analytic approximations for the millilensing magnification in the limit of a large source .",
    "our work complements theirs by presenting exact results for a large range of source sizes , by considering some of the effects in more details , and also by applying the general theory to four specific observed lenses .",
    "thus our paper has two main goals : to better understand the flux ratio anomalies in four observed radio lenses ; and to study finite source effects in millilensing .",
    "the two parts are independent of each other , although we do combine them in the end to place constraints on the substructures required to produce the observed flux ratio anomalies .",
    "pedagogically , it makes sense to begin with the study of finite source effects . in ",
    "2 we develop our toy model for millilensing and use it to study the image configurations and magnifications for different source sizes and positions ; the discussion goes into some depth , so we offer a review of the main points in  [ sec : comments ] . in ",
    "3 we introduce a method for using our millilensing theory can to place lower bounds on the masses of substructures responsible for flux ratio anomalies . in ",
    "4 we turn to the analysis of real lens systems ; we first use lens models to determine which images are anomalous , and then apply our millilensing theory to derive the substructure mass bounds .",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions in  5 . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "this section presents our toy model for studying the effects of a finite source size .",
    "we define the model and then consider the image configurations and magnifications as a function of the position and size of the source .",
    "although the focus is millilensing , our results have some broader implications that are discussed in  [ sec : comments ] .      in lens modeling , it is common to begin with a smooth ` macromodel ' that reproduces the number and positions of the lensed images .",
    "smooth models generally fail to fit the observed flux ratios , so small clumps are introduced that modify the flux ratios enough to fit the data .",
    "( the clumps may modify the image positions as well , but not by much more than current measurement errors ; see  [ sec : pos ] . ) to understand the effects of a clump near one of the lensed images , we zoom in and consider the lens mapping only in the vicinity of the clump .",
    "the clump is small compared with the galaxy ( @xmath11 ) , so on this scale the macromodel can be approximated as a constant convergence and shear ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ) .",
    "the image magnification predicted by the macromodel is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the local lens mapping ( in coordinates aligned with the local shear for simplicity ) , @xmath16.\\ ] ] we can distinguish between three types of images based on the eigenvalues of this matrix .",
    "positive parity images have @xmath17 .",
    "negative parity images have @xmath18 , so they are parity reversed in one direction .",
    "double negative parity images have @xmath19 , so they are parity reversed in both directions ; however , images of this type are faint , rarely observed , and of relatively little importance for substructure lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the special case of an isothermal ellipsoid macromodel , @xmath20 everywhere .",
    "many studies of millilensing have assumed that the clump lies in the halo of the main lens galaxy , but @xcite and @xcite have pointed out that a clump elsewhere along the line of sight could still have a significant effect . while one can invoke statistical arguments about whether a clump is more likely to lie in the galaxy or along the line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , strictly speaking the clump redshift is unknown and that may lead to a systematic uncertainty in a millilensing analysis .",
    "fortunately , this effect is easily accommodated in our formalism .",
    "@xcite showed that if the clump does lie at a different redshift than the lens galaxy , the macromodel can still be treated as a simple convergence and shear , but with effective values @xmath21 }      { ( 1-\\beta\\kappa)^2 - ( \\beta\\gamma)^2}\\ , \\nonumber\\\\    \\gamma_{\\rm eff } & = & \\frac{(1-\\beta)\\gamma }      { ( 1-\\beta\\kappa)^2 - ( \\beta\\gamma)^2}\\ , \\label{eq : los}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 for a foreground clump ( @xmath23 ) , while @xmath24 for a background clump ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "in what follows we simply use @xmath12 and @xmath13 to denote the macromodel , bearing in mind that we should use the effective values if we want to consider a line - of - sight clump .",
    "another possible systematic effect arises from the ` mass sheet degeneracy ' in the macromodel . adding a uniform mass sheet ( and rescaling the galaxy mass appropriately ) leaves the image positions and flux ratios unchanged @xcite . turning the problem around",
    ", lens models can not detect the presence of a mass sheet , which can bias the conclusions drawn from the models @xcite .",
    "we should therefore consider how a mass sheet might affect a millilensing analysis .",
    "for our purposes , adding a mass sheet of density @xmath26 is equivalent to a simple rescaling of the macromodel : @xmath27 this rescaling is the same no matter whether the clump lies in the lens galaxy or along the line of sight .",
    "we model the mass clump as a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) .",
    "one of the advantages of the sis is that its @xmath28 density profile yields a simple form for the deflection angle , @xmath29 where the einstein radius @xmath30 is @xmath31 here , @xmath32 is the velocity dispersion of the sis , while @xmath33 and @xmath34 are angular diameter distances from the observer or lens to the source .",
    "although n - body simulations predict a different form for the density profile of dark matter structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sis has been used for modeling substructures in previous studies @xcite , and its simplicity makes it an attractive choice for a toy model whose purpose is to yield general insights .",
    "the mass of the sis increases linearly with radius , and the projected 2-d mass within the einstein radius is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the critical surface density for lensing .",
    "the clump + macromodel system is governed by the lens equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 are coordinates in the source plane and @xmath39 are coordinates in the image plane ( centred on the clump ) . in substructure lensing ,",
    "solutions of this lens equation represent ` micro - images ' that are not separately resolved but combine to form the observed macro - image . for a point source ,",
    "the individual micro - image magnifications are given by @xmath40 the tangential critical curve for the lens system can be found by taking @xmath41 , which yields @xmath42 plugging this into the lens equation then gives a parametric equation for the tangential caustic .",
    "the radial pseudo - caustic is the curve in the source plane that maps to the origin in the image plane ; from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lenseq ] ) , it can be written parametrically as @xmath43    it can be seen from equations ( [ eq : lenseq ] ) and ( [ eq : mageq ] ) that the positions and magnifications of the images of a point source depend on the perturber strength @xmath30 , the position of the source relative to the perturber , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 from the macromodel .",
    "there is no general analytic solution to the lens equation even for a simple sis perturber .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to find an analytic solution for a source of _ finite _ size at an arbitrary position .",
    "@xcite showed how to compute the area enclosed by the caustics of an sis lens in an external shear field , and in the following sections we extend their method to find the positions , shapes , and magnifications of the images of a finite source lensed by an sis in a convergence and shear field .",
    "first , we consider a circular source and parametrize its boundary : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the coordinates of the centre of the source , @xmath47 is the source size , and @xmath48 varies from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "( @xcite considered the special case @xmath51 and @xmath52 . )",
    "plugging the source boundary into the lens equation ( [ eq : lenseq ] ) yields @xmath53 we can eliminate @xmath48 by squaring and adding these two equations to obtain @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "this is a quadratic equation for @xmath56 whose solution yields the boundary of the image(s ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58          \\left [ b^2 - a^2 + u_0 ^ 2 + v_0 ^ 2 + 2\\,b\\,u_0\\,\\cos\\theta          + 2\\,b\\,v_0\\,\\sin\\theta\\right]\\\\    & & \\qquad + 4\\left[u_0(\\kappa+\\gamma-1)\\cos\\theta+b(\\kappa+\\gamma\\cos2\\theta-1 )          + v_0(\\kappa-\\gamma-1)\\sin\\theta\\right]^2 , \\\\",

    "while eq .",

    ", we can solve analytically for the perturbed micro - image(s ) , and then compute numerically the change in the position and magnification of the macro - image . while this is a simplified toy model , it yields valuable insight into the general features of finite source effects in substructure lensing :    * the perturbations do not have a simple dependence on source size , but are related to intersections of the source with micro - caustics . *",
    "positive parity images are always amplified by isothermal clumps , but negative parity images may be either amplified or suppressed depending on the source position and size . *",
    "sources that are more than an order of magnitude larger than the clump einstein radius can still be perturbed at the percent level , which mildly contradicts conventional wisdom that a source can not ` feel ' lensing structure on scales smaller than itself .",
    "* statistical uncertainties in the macromodel do not significantly affect the substructure analysis .",
    "remarkably , the mass sheet degeneracy in the macromodel has _ no effect _ on the substructure analysis , at least for isothermal clumps .",
    "* astrometric perturbations could be at the few milli - arcsec level , and could be identified by comparing the relative image positions at different wavelengths .",
    "the bottom line is that there is a tremendous amount to be learned from high - resolution observations at a variety of wavelengths that correspond to different source sizes .",
    "the promising possibilities are observations of the optical , mid - ir , and radio continua , and the optical emission lines .",
    "( detailed x - ray observations seem less valuable , because the source will be much smaller than the caustics for millilensing . )",
    "the first steps in this direction have been taken @xcite , but a more concerted effort to do this for flux ratio anomaly lenses is called for .",
    "it is already possible to place limits on the substructure mass scale : since there is a finite range of magnifications possible for a given ratio of the clump einstein radius @xmath30 to the source size @xmath47 , an observed flux perturbation leads directly to a lower bound on @xmath132 ( even with no knowledge of the relative positions of perturber and source ) . adding knowledge of ( or assumptions about ) the source size then leads to a lower bound on the clump mass .",
    "these substructure bounds do depend on our assumption that each flux ratio anomaly is caused by a single , isolated , isothermal clump ; how they change for different clump models and for the limit of moderate or high optical depth will be the subject of a follow - up study .",
    "still , the principle that finite source effects permit simple _ lower _ bounds on the substructure mass scale should be general .    with this background",
    ", we have sought to understand three known lensing systems with strong flux ratio anomalies at radio wavelengths ( b1422 + 231 , b1555 + 375 , and b2045 + 265 ) , plus one system with marginal evidence for a radio flux ratio anomaly ( b0712 + 472 ) .",
    "we carefully examined macromodels consisting of an isothermal lens galaxy with different types of angular structure , in order to determine which of the lensed images are perturbed and by how much . assuming isothermal clumps",
    ", we could then use our substructure analysis to place lower bounds on the clump masses . for b1422 + 231 , we find strong evidence for a clump in front of image a , and the mass within the clump einstein radius must be @xmath252 . for b2045 + 265 and b1555 + 375 , we find strong evidence for clumps in front of _ two _ images in each systems .",
    "the masses within the einstein radii are @xmath253@xmath254 , which generally agreees with @xmath0cdm predictions , although it is important to consider whether @xmath0cdm predicts enough clumps to explain the presence of multiple anomalies in multiple lenses . in b0712 + 472",
    ", there is marginal evidence for a clump in front of image c. we emphasize that our identification of the images that are perturbed is independent of assumptions about the nature of substructure ; those assumptions enter only when we derive quantitative clump mass bounds .    to round out our analysis , we have considered several systematic effects in the substructure mass bounds . as noted above , statistical uncertainties in the macromodel propagate into the substructure analysis , but their effects are small .",
    "in many lensing applications the main problem is the mass sheet degeneracy in the macromodel , but we have shown that it has no effect on the substructure analysis , at least for isothermal clumps .",
    "thus , it turns out that the main systematics are the uncertainty in the source size , and lack of knowedlge about whether the clump lies within the main lens galaxy ( a standard assumption ) or elsewhere along the line of sight .",
    "varying the clump redshift over a reasonable range can change the clump mass bounds by a factor of a few .",
    "so it is certainly important for detailed quantitative results , but not so important for order of magnitude reasoning .    ultimately , using flux ratio anomalies to test @xmath0cdm and draw conclusions about the nature of dark matter relies on sophisticated statistical analyses with realistic clump models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "toy models like ours are still valuable , though , because they reveal and clarify the general principles on which the sophisticated analyses are based .",
    "for example , our results suggest that looking for effects requiring comparable scales for the source size and the lensing substructure will be the best way to distinguish the substructure explanation for flux ratio anomalies from competing hypotheses that may be disfavored but not yet ruled out . furthermore , we believe that a detailed understanding of flux ratio anomalies in individual lenses will always be an important complement to ` black box ' statistical machinery .",
