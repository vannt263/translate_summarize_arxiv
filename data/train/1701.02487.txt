    "recent progress in design and manufacturing of new photonic materials has enabled novel models and multifunctional devices to achieve unprecedented control of light . in particular , by using various techniques based on transformation optics , the possibilities have appeared to electromagnetically isolate a space region for certain frequencies or range of frequencies .",
    "it means that an object located inside such a space region will practically stop interacting with illuminating light @xcite .",
    "in fact , a remote observer will not be able to detect the presence of the objects that are shielded and protected by optical cloaking .",
    "a major drawback in practical applications of these techniques is due to the properties of materials needed , either artificial or natural , that exhibit extreme permittivity or permeability .",
    "however , coatings can be designed such as metal - dielectric multilayer or metasurfaces to drastically reduce the scattered signal from subwavelength particles and make the assembly nearly undetectable @xcite .",
    "of course , the light interacts with the nanoparticles , but the destructive interference of different elements that constitute the complex nanostructure practically cancels out the scattered radiation .    graphene represents a groundbreaking and exciting material that combines suitable characteristics for the use in optoelectronic devices in far - infrared and thz region of frequencies due to the intrinsic ability to mold the surface current with low - loss rates @xcite .",
    "high conductivity within atomically thin layer of graphene , and significant tuning ability via the applied bias voltage , enables the cancellation of scattering effects .",
    "drastically reduced overall visibility of the scattering object that was conducted via graphene monolayer wrapping the cylinder , for the first time , was extended to the far - infrared range of frequencies by chen and alu @xcite . in that case , the local polarizability of a nanowire with moderately thick diameter and the graphene coating sheet with the opposite signs can be mutually cancelled under suitable layout .",
    "different schemes have been proposed with plasmonic compounds , using a dipole moment of opposite phase to attain a scattering cancellation @xcite .",
    "if the incident radiation is @xmath0-polarized , however , the spectral response of the scattering cross section seems to be totally dissimilar @xcite .",
    "then , a set formed by a peak , associated with the scattering via a narrow mie mode , and a valley offers the prospect to obtain invisibility with unprecedented control over the wire resonance spectral location by changing the chemical potential .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the previous concept by employing a @xmath0-polarized incident plane wave that illuminates a graphene coated dielectric nanowire in order to get near the fundamental localized surface plasmon polariton .",
    "subsequently we optimize the scattering cancellation of the nanocavity .",

    "the invisibility window is manifested at the wavelength @xmath98 , where a drastic reduction of the scattering wave field is apparent . here",

    "for instance , the scattering minimum spans from @xmath124 to @xmath125 in the interval where @xmath1 changes from @xmath126 to @xmath127 , whereas the variation of the resonant peak is produced from a wavelength of @xmath128 to @xmath129 .",
