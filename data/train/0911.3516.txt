    "in 1977 a.  lins  neto , w.  de  melo and c.  c.  pugh @xcite examined small perturbations of a linear center for a special class of polynomial vector fields on the plane .",

    "ilyashenko and a.  panov @xcite got an explicit upper bound for the number of limit cycles of linard equations through the ( odd ) degree of the monic polynomial @xmath9 and magnitudes of its coefficients .",
    "their result reclined on the theorem of ilyashenko and yakovenko that binds the number of zeros and the growth of a holomorphic function @xcite .    in 2007",
    "f.  dumortier , d.  panazzolo and r.  roussarie @xcite constructed a counterexample to the conjecture of a.  lins  neto , w.  de  melo and c.  c.  pugh .",
