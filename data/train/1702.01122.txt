    "in 1875 , william herschel introduced `` star gauging '' as a technique to understand the shape of the galaxy .",
    "herschel suggested that by splitting the heavens into cells and by counting the number of stars in each , it should be possible to determine the position of the sun within the milky way .",
    "even though he promoted the method as `` the most general and the most proper '' , herschel was quick to point out the possibility of strong systematic effects given that different telescopes would probe the skies to different depths .",
    "over the centuries , herschel s prophecy of the merit of the technique was confirmed , and most recently , the data from the all - sky surveys such as two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) @xcite and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite has been used to show off its true power .",
    "however , as the telescope might grew and yet fainter stars were counted , the problem of minute but systematic depth variations blossomed into a major hindrance to studies of the milky way structure .        in the galaxy , the one application that suffers",
    "the most from the non - uniform quality of the `` star gage '' is the search for the faint sub - structures in the stellar halo .",
    "ultra - faint satellites and stellar streams appear as low - level enhancements of the stellar density field and as such can either be destroyed or mimicked by the survey systematics .",
    "for example , for a given exposure on a given telescope , a combination of the atmosphere stability , the sky brightness and the image resolution controls the limiting magnitude at which stars can be distinguished from galaxies with certainty .",
    "of these three factors above , only the camera properties are invariant with time , while - as seen from the ground - the sky is constantly changing .",
    "thus , the faint star counts will fluctuate as a function of the position on the sky in accordance with the survey progress . around the limiting magnitude",
    ", the loss of genuine stars to poor weather conditions is exacerbated by the influx of spurious `` stars '' , i.e. compact faint galaxies misclassified as stellar objects . at low galactic latitudes , diffraction spikes , blooming and ghosts produced by bright stars",
    "also contribute large numbers of fictitious `` stars '' . as a result ,",
    "typically , over - densities of bogus stellar objects caused by misclassified galaxies in galaxy clusters and by artifacts around bright stars outnumber bona - fide satellites by several orders of magnitude .    today , some 230 years after herschel s first attempt , _ gaia _ , the european space observatory , as part of the data release 1 , has produced the most precise star gage ever @xcite .",
    "positions , magnitudes and morphological classifications of over a billion stars , as recorded in the gaiasource table , do not suffer from poor weather conditions or dramatic sky brightness variations .",
    "better still , any spurious objects reported by the on - board detection algorithm , are double - checked and discarded after subsequent visits . in terms of the star - galaxy separation , _ gaia _ is truly unrivaled .",
    "not only its angular resolution is comparable to that of the wfc3 camera on - board of the hst , _ gaia _ can additionally discriminate between stars and galaxies based on the differences in their astrometric behavior .",
    "motivated by the unique properties of the _ gaia _ dr1 data , here we investigate the mission s capabilities for satellite detection .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : detection ] presents the details of the satellite detection algorithm as applied to the _ gaia _ dr1 data .",
    "the _ gaia _",
    "discoveries are discussed in section  [ sec : discovery ] .",
    "section  [ sec : properties ] studies the properties of the new satellites .",
    "the entirety of the analysis presented in this paper is based on the first _ gaia _",
    "data product released in late 2016 , the table . for details on the contents and the properties of this catalog",
    "we refer the reader to the _ gaia _ data release 1 paper @xcite .",
    "note that in this paper the only quantities from the catalog that we use are the stellar positions ( ra and dec ) , the g - band magnitudes @xcite and the values of the astrometric_excess_noise parameter @xcite .",
    "the principal ideas behind our galactic satellite detection algorithm have been extensively covered in the literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the _ gaia _ dr1 data represents a rather unusual and - in parts - challenging dataset to apply these simply `` out of the box '' .",
    "this is primarily due to the absence of the object color information , unless , of course , cross - matched with other surveys , which are usually either less deep than _ gaia _ , such as 2mass and apass or do not cover the whole sky .",
    "additionally , at magnitudes fainter than @xmath5 , the survey s depth starts to vary significantly as a function of the position on the sky . as a result , in this very early data release , the _ gaia _ sky appears to look like an intricate pattern of gaps of varying sizes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the combination of the factors above drove us to introduce a slight modification to the stellar overdensity identification method .",
    "we do use the kernel density estimation with gaussian kernels of varying width , however in order to assess the significance of the density deviation at any given point on the sky , we do not rely on the poisson distribution of the stellar number counts .",
    "instead we obtain a local estimate of the variance of the density .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath6 is the properly normalized density kernel on the sphere , @xmath7 is the histogram of the star counts ( on healpix grid on the sky , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the density estimate is simply the convolution @xmath8 and the significance of the overdensity @xmath9 , where the average @xmath10 and the variance @xmath11 are calculated over the healpix neighborhood ( annulus ) of a given point . given the normalisation by local variance , areas with pronounced non - uniformities related to the _ gaia _ scanning law , or regions with large changes in extinction are naturally down - weighted in their contribution to significance .    given that the first _",
    "dr does not provide color information , we have to be particularly careful when selecting objects for the satellite search ( we can not use color - magnitude masks based on stellar isochrones , as in i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "for the analysis in this paper we apply only two selection cuts .",
    "first cut concerns the _ gaia _ @xmath12 magnitude : @xmath13 .",
    "the reason for getting rid of bright stars , i.e. those with @xmath14 is twofold .",
    "first , for absolute majority of interesting targets at reasonable distances from the sun we expect the luminosity function of their stellar populations to rapidly rise with magnitude at @xmath14 . therefore , in these satellites ( globular clusters and dwarf galaxies ) , the number of stars fainter than @xmath15 should vastly overwhelm the number of bright stars . instead , the brighter magnitudes are dominated by the foreground contamination . equally important",
    "is the fact that most ( or all ) satellites with significant populations of stars at @xmath16 have likely been already detected , either through studies of the 2mass photometry ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or via the inspection of the archival photographic plate data ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the cut at faint magnitudes @xmath17 is less straightforward .",
    "usually , when dealing with large optical ground - based surveys , it is advisable to restrict the data to be limited by the apparent magnitude which gives the most uniform density map .",
    "however , in our case , due to the relatively shallow _ gaia _",
    "dr1 depth in combination with the rising stellar luminosity function for objects of interest , the benefits of going to e.g. @xmath18 as compared to @xmath19 outweigh the drawbacks of dealing with non - uniform density distribution , caused by spatially varying incompleteness ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "accordingly , for our analysis we set the faint limit at @xmath18 .",
    "the second and final cut applied to the catalog concerns the star / galaxy separation .",
    "while the _ gaia _ s on - board detection algorithm was designed with point sources in mind , the observatory nonetheless detects ( and reports ) compact galaxies at faint magnitudes as well as compact portions of extended galaxies .",
    "in fact , in the high latitude ( |b|>30 ) area where _ gaia _ overlaps with the sdss , at magnitude @xmath5 around @xmath20% of sources detected by _",
    "gaia _ and reported in the gaiasource catalog are classified by the sdss as galaxies ( bear in mind though that the sdss star - galaxy classification is not 100% correct ) .",
    "as galaxies are much more clustered than stars , it is crucial to filter them out from the sample before embarking on the search for over - densities . in the gaiasource catalog , the parameter which correlates the most with the object s non - stellarity is the astrometric_excess_noise metric which measures the extra scatter in the astrometric solution of all objects @xcite . here , in order to reject extended sources in the magnitude range @xmath13 we adopt the following magnitude - dependent cut on the astrometric_excess_noise parameter : @xmath21 the quality of this selection can be assessed using the sdss catalog : in the magnitude range @xmath22 , more than 95% of _ gaia _ sources rejected by the above cut are classified by sdss as galaxies confirming that this is indeed a very effective way to weed out spurious `` stars '' from the _ gaia _ stellar sample .     and",
    "satisfying the stellarity selection ( eq .  [ eq : star_gal ] ) .",
    "the significance of the detection of each object is shown in the title .",
    "the number of stars per bin corresponding to white and black color in the density maps is given in brackets in the panel titles . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : sign_map ] shows the map of significances of overdensities as measured using the gaussian kernel with @xmath23 .",
    "this map is produced using the entire gaiasource catalog filtered with the cuts described above .",
    "note the compact yellow spots , the vast majority of which correspond to the overdensities associated with the known galactic satellites .",
    "the underlying fine web of green - blue filaments is related to the _ gaia _ scanning law .",
    "in this paper , we choose to focus only on the most obvious detections , i.e. those above 6@xmath24 in significance . from the suite of runs of the overdensity detection algorithm with different kernels ranging from 1.5@xmath4 to 24@xmath4 ,",
    "a total of 259 such candidates were identified . at the next step ,",
    "these were cross - matched with various catalogs of star clusters and nearby galaxies @xcite as well as the cds s simbad database @xcite .",
    "out of the 259 objects , 244 had a clear association with a known star cluster or a galaxy .",
    "to our surprise the list of previously known satellites detected in the _ gaia _ dr1 data at high significance was not limited to the classical globular clusters and the classical dwarf galaxies , known for decades . amongst the detections , we found several ultra - faint dwarf galaxies , such as canes venatici i @xcite , detected at significance of 9.1 @xmath24 , bootes i @xcite detected at 6.7 @xmath24 , and reticulum 2 @xcite with significance of 6.3 .",
    "some other , fainter dwarfs such as canes venatici  ii @xcite and crater  2 @xcite were also detected , albeit at slightly lower significance ( below our nominal threshold ) , i.e. 5.8 and 5.1 respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : params ]    figure  [ fig : knowns ] shows the density distributions of stellar sources around some of the dwarf galaxies detected in _",
    "gaia _ dr1 .",
    "these range from one of the most prominent dwarfs , namely umi , to the notoriously difficult to find ultra - faints , several of which were detected less than two years ago in the dark energy survey data @xcite .",
    "these examples demonstrate the incredible purity and quality of the gaiasource catalog , and highlight _ gaia _ s superb satellite discovery capabilities even without color information .",
    "while exploring the candidate over - density list , we have stumbled upon two previously unknown objects detected with very high significance , which are going to be the focus of the rest of the paper .",
    "the first stellar overdensity without an obvious counterpart , i.e. without an entry in any of the clusters / galaxies catalogs available to us , has an estimated significance of @xmath3 10 .",
    "note however , that initially , this candidate , dubbed here gaia  1 , was rejected as it is located in close proximity of the brightest star on the sky  sirius .",
    "figure  [ fig : gaia_2ddensity ] shows the distribution of sources in the area around the candidate from three different surveys : _ gaia _ , 2mass and wise @xcite .",
    "as the figure demonstrates , the overdensity in _ gaia_-detected sources is indeed very prominent ( top left and top middle panels ) .",
    "note a white patch corresponding to a dearth of _ gaia _ sources near the center of the over - density .",
    "this is the location of sirius , where _ gaia _ struggles to detect genuine stars .",
    "the area affected by sirius is much larger in the 2mass data , as evidenced in the right panel .",
    "however , even here , a stellar overdensity corresponding to the candidate in question is noticeable .",
    "the object itself can be seen directly in the images from the infrared wise survey ( bottom row ) .",
    "the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : gaia_2ddensity ] show the view of the @xmath25 area around the overdensity as provided by the un - wise project @xcite .",
    "the left panel displays the original wise data with sirius in the picture , while the middle panel has the star subtracted using a circularly symmetric psf model . in both cases",
    "the overdensity of sources in the central parts of gaia  1 is clearly visible .",
    "this is the most straightforward and the most secure confirmation of the newly identified satellite .",

    "we also note that in the very center there is a tight group of stars which causes the innermost point in the density profile to deviate from plummer . ]",
    "our next step is to try to assess the nature of the overdensity by means of studying its color - magnitude diagram properties .",
    "unfortunately , the _ gaia _ dr1 release does not contain color information , so we are forced to use much shallower 2mass data .",
    "left panel of figure  [ fig : gaia1_cmd ] shows the extinction - corrected hess diagram obtained by combining 2mass and _ gaia _ photometry for the field centered on the gaia  1 .",
    "the red giant branch together with prominent red clump ( or red horizontal branch ) at @xmath30 are both clearly visible .",
    "the other two panels of the figure show the 2mass - only color magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) .",
    "the middle panel gives the cmd of the stars within the central parts of gaia  1 together with the parsec isochrone @xcite with @xmath31}=-0.7 $ ] and age of @xmath32gyr overplotted .",
    "the right panel of the figure displays the color - magnitiude distribution of the foreground stars in the part of the sky @xmath28 degrees away from the center of gaia  1 , but with the same area as the field shown in the middle panel .",
    "we note that the isochrone reproduces the location of the red clump and the red giant branch and that the color - magnitude diagram distribution in gaia  1 is clearly different from the distribution of the foreground stars , which provides another confirmation that the object is a genuine satellite .",
    "note that that gaia  1 has potential member stars with magnitudes visible with a naked eye !    a better idea of the object s",
    "stellar populations can be gleaned from the recently released pan - starrs1 ( ps1 ) data @xcite . due to the presence of an extremely bright star nearby , the quality of the ps1 data in the region is significantly compromised but the catalogs remain immensely useful .",
    "we obtain a list of sources around gaia  1 from the stack detections catalog ( the stackobjectthin table ) and require that the sources have the folowing flags : stack_primary , psfmodel , fitted on , and do not have the sky_failure flag .",
    "this together with the cut on extinction - corrected r - band magnitude of @xmath33 provides a relatively clean source subset and allows us to finally peer at the deeper color - magnitude diagram of the satellite .",
    "left panel of figure  [ fig : gaia1_cmd_ps ] shows the @xmath34 vs @xmath29 extinction - corrected @xcite background - subtracted hess diagram , while the hess diagram of the foreground stellar population is displayed on the right . with the ps1 data being deeper",
    "compared to 2mass , we can see the large number of turn - off stars at @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note , that these are exactly the stars that contributed most of the signal in the _ gaia _ overdensity detection .",
    "the ps1 data also shows the rhb ( or the red clump ) at @xmath37 0.3 .",
    "as the figure indicates , the @xmath38gyr and @xmath39}=-0.7 $ ] isochrone also provides a decent description of the ps1 data .",
    "the second object in our list possesses a significance of 9@xmath24 .",
    "this overdensity is located in dense stellar field of the sky , close to the galactic plane at @xmath40 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gaia2 ] shows an array of discovery plots confirming that the candidate is indeed a _ bona - fide _ satellite .",
    "the left panel of the figure gives the density distribution of the _ gaia _ sources with @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the extinction - corrected _ gaia _ g - magnitude ) and @xmath43 .",
    "here we use the @xcite dust map and the extinction coefficient of 2.55 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is clear that _ gaia _ has detected a pronounced stellar overdensity in the center of the field .",
    "the next panel gives the density distribution of the 2mass sources and here , similarly to gaia  1 we see an overdensity at lower significance .",
    "the middle right panel displays the color mosaic of the digital sky survey ( dss ) ( blue / red ) images of the area .",
    "note an agglomeration of stars clearly visible in the center of the image .",
    "the rightmost panel presents the dust extinction distribution as reported by the planck satellite ( see * ? ? ?",
    "while some spatial variation of extinction is noticeable in the area , including a small decrease in reddening in the very center of the field , there exists no correlation between the dust distribution and the _ gaia _ stellar density distribution .",
    "thus , based on the evidence listed above , we conclude that this overdensity is also a genuine galactic satellite , named gaia  2 hereafter .",
    "figure  [ fig : gaia2_cmd ] gives a glimpse of the color - magnitude distribution of the stars in gaia  2 .",
    "the 2mass - based hess diagram ( left ) assuredly exhibits the red - giant branch with a possible red clump .",
    "note that both of these cmd features are clearly absent in the foreground population ( right panel of the figure ) . for gaia  2",
    ", we also utilize the ps1 data to obtain a deeper color - magnitude diagram of the object .",
    "accordingly , figure  [ fig : gaia2_cmd_ps1 ] shows the background - subtracted and extinction - corrected hess diagram of the central parts of the gaia  2 in the ps1 data , while the right panel displays the background hess diagram ; both panels use the @xmath44 and @xmath45 bands .",
    "the depth of the ps1 data is sufficient to see the main sequence ( ms ) of the satellite .",
    "the presence of the obvious ms is the final confirmation of the nature of this stellar overdensity .",
    "the extinction - corrected photometry of the satellite as supplied by 2mass and ps1 is relatively shallow , thus limiting our ability to accurately measure the system s age , metallicity and distance .",
    "however the problem is remedied to some degree by the presence of the obvious red clump , visible in the color - mangitude diagram discussed above , that allows robust distance determination .",
    "the 2mass extinction corrected k magnitude of the red clump of gaia  1 is @xmath46 ( with a statistical uncertainty less than 0.01 mag ) . although the absolute magnitude of the red clump might depend weakly on the age and the metallicity of the stellar population , we assume @xmath47 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and discussion there ) .",
    "this gives us a distance modulus of @xmath48 corresponding to @xmath49 kpc ( assuming a systematic uncertainty of @xmath3 0.1 on the red - clump absolute magnitude ) . with the distance estimate in hand",
    "we can now constrain the age and the metallicity of the system by fitting isochrones to the data . here",
    "we do not try to carry out the full stellar population modeling , due to the limitations of the data currently available .",
    "we simply point out that the @xmath38gyr and @xmath39}=-0.7 $ ] isochrone at the distance dictate by the red clump magnitude appears to describe well both the 2mass red giant branch and the main sequence turn - off visible in the ps1 data ( see figures  [ fig : gaia1_cmd ] and [ fig : gaia1_cmd_ps ] ) .            as the next step",
    "we proceed with the structural parameters determination . due to the proximity of sirius and possible spatially variable incompleteness in the catalogue at faint magnitudes ,",
    "we have decided to use only stars with @xmath50 and located far enough from sirius ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "for the same reason , instead of doing the 2-d density analysis we perform an un - binned 1-d density profile fitting using the plummer model for the satellite and the uniform background density .",
    "table  [ tab : params ] gives the results of the fit together with their uncertainties as determined from 1-d posteriors , which were sampled using the emcee ensemble sampler @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : gaia1_1dprof ] shows the gaia  1 s observed 1d density profile together with our best - fit plummer model .",
    "we note that that innermost point of the density profile is deviating slightly from the model , and that the 2-d stellar distribution in gaia  1 seems to have a rather compact group of stars in the very center ( see top middle panel of figure  [ fig : gaia_2ddensity ] ) .",
    "we are not able , at this point , to determine the exact cause of this over - density , or even to rule out an artefact unambiguously .",
    "the satellite s half - light radius determined from the fit is @xmath52 which corresponds to @xmath3 9 pc .",
    "based on the size typical for globular clusters in the mw , we conclude that gaia  1 is a star cluster , most likely of globular variety given its age and metallicity .",
    "it also could be an old open cluster similar to e.g. berkeley  25 located only @xmath31 degree away on the sky from gaia  1 . from the density profile fit",
    "we also determine the total number of the satellite s stars with @xmath12<19 , @xmath53 . assuming the chabrier imf and the best - fit isochrone",
    ", we deduce the total stellar mass of 14000 @xmath54 and the @xmath55-band luminosity of @xmath56 .",
    "note please that these numbers are only the ball - park estimates due to the uncertain age and metallicity of the stellar population .    to investigate the cluster s orbital properties",
    ", we also attempt to gauge the proper motion of the gaia  1 s stellar membership .",
    "unfortunately , due to the proximity to sirius , the bright satellite members are not present in the tgas catalog .",
    "instead , we deduce the proper motion by combining gaiasource astrometry with 2mass astrometry . selecting red clump stars with @xmath57<@xmath58<@xmath59 and @xmath60k@xmath61 measured from the cross - match of gaiasource with 2mass within 0.2 degrees of gaia  1 ( we postulate that this sample is dominated by the cluster members )",
    "we obtain a median proper motion of @xmath62 mas / yr .",
    "this can be compared to the properties of the field stars located in the same color - magnitude box but found between 0.2 and 1 degree away from the cluster .",
    "the field proper motion is clearly different at @xmath63 mas / yr .",
    "note that the above values have been corrected for the average proper motion offset between the tgas measurements and the gaiasource+2mass measurements , i.e. for the biases in the latter due to possible systematics in the 2mass astrometry .",
    "notwithstanding the correction , the quality of the measured proper motion remains questionable given the complicated area under consideration .",
    "we expect however that with the _ gaia _ second data release the satellite s proper motion will be measured much more robustly .",
    "the properties of the gaia  2 s stellar population , namely its metallicity and age can be deduced from the combination of the 2mass and ps1 photometry . however , because the ps1 data is limited to the lower main sequence , this analysis is subject to a substantial age - metallicity degeneracy . through experiments with parsec isochrones ,",
    "we find that the stellar population with 10gyr and @xmath39}=-1 $ ] fits both the lower main sequence in ps1 and the red giant branch in 2mass . the distance modulus implied by this isochrone is @xmath64 corresponding to the distance of @xmath65kpc . a better imaging is definitely required to make a more detailed determination of the age , metallicity and distance of this object .    to measure the structural parameters of gaia  2 we model the distribution of the gaiasource number counts",
    "we restrict the sample to stars with @xmath41 .",
    "the spatial density distribution is then modeled with a combination of a flat background and an elliptical plummer profile for the satellite ( for more details see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting measurements are given in the table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "we find that the object is mildly elliptical , although at low significance levels .",
    "the half - light radius of the object is @xmath66 , which at the distance of @xmath65kpc corresponds to @xmath67pc .",
    "thus , gaia  2 is almost three times smaller compared to gaia  1 .",
    "the total luminosity of the cluster can be estimated similarly to that of gaia  1 using the best - fit isochrone and the total number of stars with @xmath50 , resulting in @xmath68 .",
    "given its size , metallicity , age and appearance on the image cutouts , it is most likely a globular cluster , or an old open cluster .",
    "this paper presents the results of the very first exploration of the _ gaia _ capabilities for galactic satellite detection . while we have identified a number of new interesting satellite candidates , here we describe only two objects , gaia  1 and gaia  2 , whose nature can be determined unambiguously with extant data .",
    "possessing remarkably high levels of significance - in excess of 9 ( ! )",
    "- both were , nevertheless , missed by previous imaging surveys .",
    "gaia _ appears to offer a unique view of the galactic stellar distribution , unrivaled even by datasets reaching to significantly fainter magnitudes .",
    "it is due to the combination of the _ gaia _ s high angular resolution and the high purity of its stellar sample , objects like gaia  1 can be discovered .",
    "gaia  1 is a large and luminous star cluster , with several member stars potentially visible even with a naked eye .",
    "however , it is positioned almost exactly behind sirius , the brightest star in the sky , which appears to be the perfect hiding place even for a satellite of such grand prominence .",
    "countless generations of astronomers must have stared right at gaia  1 , blissfully unaware of its existence .",
    "the area around sirius is difficult to analyse as it is littered with artifacts spawned by this extremely bright star .",
    "however , given the _",
    "s multi - epoch data - stream , such artifacts can be weeded out in the preparation of the gaiasource catalog .",
    "each time _ gaia _ looks at sirius , the spurious sources appear in different positions on the sky compared to the previous visits and thus are discarded after cross - match .",
    "even if some spurious sources make it to the final gaiasource catalog , they can be identified very efficiently based on their unusual astrometric behavior .",
    "we have demonstrated that the _ gaia _ data can be used to detect classical dwarf galaxies , ultra faint dwarfs and star clusters in a wide range of sizes and luminosities .",
    "all of these are detected with ease using the _ gaia _ s stellar positions only in the catalog which is known to suffer from spatially - variable incompleteness .",
    "we therefore predict with confidence , that in the future _ gaia _ data releases , when the completeness is stabilized and the color , distance and proper motion information is added , many new galactic satellites will be revealed .",
    "we acknowledge the usage of the hyperleda database ( http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr ) . this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",

    "<S> we present the results of the very first search for faint milky way satellites in the _ gaia _ data . using stellar positions only , we are able to re - discover objects detected in much deeper data as recently as the last couple of years . while we do not identify new prominent ultra - faint dwarf galaxies , we report the discovery of two new star clusters , gaia  1 and gaia  2 . </S>",
    "<S> gaia  1 is particularly curious , as it is a massive ( 1.4@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 ) , large ( @xmath39 pc ) and nearby ( 4.6 kpc ) cluster , situated 10@xmath4 away from the brightest star on the sky , sirius ! </S>",
    "<S> even though this satellite is detected at significance in excess of 10 , it was missed by previous sky surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that _ gaia _ possesses powerful and unique capabilities for satellite detection thanks to its unrivaled angular resolution and highly efficient object classification .    </S>",
