    "since the european muon collaboration ( emc ) measured the first moment @xmath6 ( at @xmath7=3  ( gev / c)@xmath8 ) of the proton spin structure function @xmath9  @xcite , there has been a great deal of discussion about the spin content of the proton .",
    "an immediate and unexpected consequence of the emc measurement was that the quark contribution to the spin of the proton was very small ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "a series of following experiments  @xcite confirmed the emc measurement , giving , however a somewhat larger , but still small value for @xmath0 .",
    "this result is in contradiction with expectations based on the naive , nonrelativistic quark model , supplemented by the assumption that the contribution of strange quarks to @xmath11 was zero ( @xmath12 )  @xcite .",
    "the emc measurements required @xmath13 and relatively large .",
    "these two results : @xmath14 and @xmath13 are often referred to as _",
    "spin crisis_. let us shortly summarize how the crisis arises .",
    "theoretical analysis of recent measurements  @xcite indicates that the @xmath11 is equal to : @xmath15 on the other hand the @xmath11 is related to the integrated polarized quark densities : @xmath16 here for simplicity we neglect higher orders and higher twist contributions . comparing eq.([ip ] ) with eq.([ip2 ] ) and assuming @xmath17  @xcite , we get immediately : @xmath18 let us quote here for completeness the experimental value for the neutron  @xcite : @xmath19 with this definition of @xmath20 the bjorken sum rule is automatically satisfied .",
    "integrated polarized quark densities @xmath21 can be in principle extracted from the hyperon semileptonic decays .",
    "it is customary to assume su(3 ) symmetry to analyze these decays .",
    "then all decay amplitudes are given in terms of two reduced matrix elements @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "for example : @xmath24 here by @xmath25 we denote the ratios of axial - vector to vector coupling constants @xmath26 for semileptonic decays as displayed in table i. taking for these decays experimental values ( see table i ) one gets @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the matrix elements of diagonal operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( called @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively ) , which define integrated quark densities @xmath21 , can be also expressed in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath33 using the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 obtained from the neutron and @xmath34 decays together with eq.([gampval ] ) we get : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . defining the quark content of the proton s spin :",
    "we obtain @xmath39 .",
    "had we used for @xmath11 the result of the first emc measurement @xmath6 , we would get even smaller value : @xmath40 .",
    "although quite often used , the above derivation of @xmath0 has , however , one serious flaw .",
    "namely we could equally well use some other decays to extract @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "for example using : @xmath41 together with the experimental data for these decays ( see table i ) and experimental value for @xmath42 , eq.([gampval ] ) , we would get @xmath43 and @xmath44 , yielding @xmath45  almost ten times less than our previous value .",
    "it is the breaking of the su(3 ) symmetry , which is responsible for this discrepancy .",
    "although the symmetry breaking in hyperon decays themselves is not that large , _",
    "i.e. _ it amounts to no more than 10 % , the effect of the symmetry breaking on @xmath0 , or integrated quark density @xmath4 , is much stronger .",
    "there are 6 measured semileptonic hyperon decays , so that the number of combinations which one can form to extract @xmath22 and @xmath23 is 14 ( actually 15 , but two conditions are linearly dependent ) . taking these 14 combinations into account and eq.([gampval ] ) we get the following values for @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which in turn give @xmath49 .",
    "these are the uncertainties of the _ central values _ due to the theoretical error caused by using su(3 ) symmetry to describe the hyperon decays .",
    "they are further increased by the experimental errors of all individual decays and the one of @xmath50 .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite made similar observation trying to fit the variation of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for various decays with one parameter related to @xmath51 .",
    "assuming further @xmath12 they were able to fit experimental data for @xmath52 with satisfactory accuracy .",
    "similarly in refs.@xcite a simple quark model has been proposed to describe the symmetry breaking in the hyperon decays .",
    "it has been observed that with the increase of the symmetry breaking parameter the value of @xmath4 increased , while @xmath0 stayed almost unchanged .",
    "semileptonic decays and @xmath0 have been also investigated within the su(3 ) skyrme model @xcite-@xcite , where @xmath53 irrespectively of the symmetry breaking .",
    "symmetry breaking influences only @xmath4 @xcite . in this",
    "respect our analysis gives a similar result : although @xmath54 it depends very weakly on @xmath51 .",
    "it is virtually impossible to analyze the symmetry breaking in weak decays without resorting to some specific model @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will implement the symmetry breaking for the hyperon decays using the chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath55qsm , see ref.@xcite for review ) .",
    "this model has proven to give satisfactory description of the axial - vector properties of hyperons @xcite@xcite .",
    "it describes the baryons as solitons rotating adiabatically in flavor space .",
    "thus it provides a link between the matrix elements of the octet of the axial - vector currents , responsible for hyperon decays , and the matrix elements of the singlet axial - vector current , in our normalization equal to @xmath0 . in the present work we will study the relation between the semileptonic decays and integrated polarized quark distributions , with the help of the @xmath56qsm .",
    "however we will use only the collective hamiltonian of the flavor rotational degrees of freedom including the corrections linear in the strange quark mass @xmath51 .",
    "the dynamical quantities in this hamiltonian , certain moments of inertia calculable within the model @xcite , are not calculated but treated as free parameters . by adjusting them to the experimentally known semileptonic",
    "decays we allow for maximal phenomenological input and minimal model dependence . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have already studied the magnetic moments of the octet and decuplet in this way .",
    "such an approach  introduced to our knowledge for the first time by adkins and nappi @xcite in the context of the skyrme model  can be viewed from two perspectives .",
    "firstly , it can be considered as a qcd motivated tool to analyze and clasify ( in terms of powers of @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) the symmetry breaking terms for a given observable .",
    "for nontrivial operators such as magnetic moments or axial form factors a general analysis , without refering to some specific model , is often virtually impossible .",
    "secondly , it also provides information for the model builders .",
    "it tells us what are the best predictions the model can ever produce .",
    "indeed , model calculations are not as unique as one might think : they depend on adopted regularization , cutoff parameters , constituent quark mass .",
    "moreover in the su(3 ) version of the @xmath56qsm the quantization ambiguity appears @xcite .",
    "so if the `` model independent '' analysis would have failed to describie the data , that would mean that the model did not corretly include all necessary physics relevant for a given observable .",
    "on the other hand the success of such an analysis gives a strong hint for the model builders that the model is correct and worth exploring .",
    "in fact this concerns all the hedgehog models which would give the collective structure identical to the one of the @xmath56qsm .    as far as the symmetry breaking",
    "is concerned , our results are identical to the ones obtained in refs.@xcite within large @xmath59 qcd .",
    "indeed , the @xmath55qsm is a specific realization of the large @xmath60 limit .",
    "the new ingredient of our analysis is the model formula for the singlet axial - vector constant @xmath61 , which we use to calculate quantities relevant for the polarized high energy experiments . in the @xmath56qsm",
    "one can define two interesting limits @xcite in which the soliton size is artificially changed either to zero ( so called quark - model limit ) , or to @xmath62 ( skyrme limit ) .",
    "in these two limiting cases one recovers the well known results : 1 ) @xmath63 in the quark model limit and 2 ) @xmath64 in the skyrme limit .",
    "this concerns not only the axial couplings ; it is often said that the @xmath56qsm _ interpolates _ between the quark model and the skyrme model .",
    "also these simple qualitative features make us believe that the model correctly describes physics essential for the axial - vector properties of the nucleon .",
    "the skyrme limit of the @xmath56qsm can be also defined as the limit in which the constituent quark mass @xmath65 .",
    "the explicit _ interpolating _ features of the su(2 ) version of the model in this limit have been discussed numerically in ref.@xcite .",
    "as we will see , in the @xmath55qsm in the chiral limit we can express the singlet axial - vector coupling through @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath66 . we see that the value of @xmath61 is very sensitive to small variations of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , since it is a difference of the two , with relatively large multiplicators .",
    "indeed , for the 14 fits mentioned above ( where as the input we use _ only _ semileptonic decays plus model formula for @xmath61 ) the central value for @xmath61 varies between @xmath67 to approximately 1 .",
    "so despite the fact that semileptonic decays are relatively well described by the model in the chiral limit , the singlet axial - vector coupling is basically undetermined .",
    "this is a clear signal of the importance of the symmetry breaking for this quantity .",
    "one could argue that this kind of behavior is just an artifact of the @xmath56qsm .",
    "however , the scenario of a rotating soliton ( which is by the way used also in the skyrme - type models ) is very plausible and can not be _ a priori _ discarded on the basis of first principles .",
    "the @xmath56qsm is a particular realization of this scenario and we use it as a tool to investigate the sensitivity of the singlet axial current to the symmetry breaking effects in hyperon decays .",
    "in fact conclusions similar to ours have been obtained in chiral perturbation theory in ref.@xcite .    as a result of our present analysis",
    "we will give predictions for the semileptonic decays not yet measured .",
    "more importantly , we will show that the symmetry breaking effects can not be neglected in the analysis of the quark contribution to the spin of the proton .",
    "in other words , linking low energy data with high energy polarized experiments is meaningful only if the su(3 ) breaking is taken into account .",
    "we will furthermore show which semileptonic decays should be measured more accurately in order to reduce the experimental errors for @xmath68 and @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we will shortly recapitulate the formalism of the @xmath56qsm needed for the calculation of semileptonic hyperon decays . in section iii",
    "we will discuss quantities relevant for the polarized parton distribution . finally in section iv we will draw conclusions .",
    "formulae used to calculate hyperon decays and axial - vector constants are collected in the appendix .",
    "the transition matrix elements of the hadronic axial - vector current @xmath69 can be expressed in terms of three independent form factors : @xmath70 u_{b_1 } ( p_1),\\ ] ] where the axial - vector current is defined as @xmath71 with @xmath72 for strangeness conserving @xmath73 currents and @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "similar expressions hold for the hadronic vector current , where the @xmath76 are replaced by @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 by @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath81 stands for the square of the momentum transfer @xmath82 .",
    "the form factors @xmath76 are real quantities depending only on the square of the momentum transfer in the case of @xmath83-invariant processes",
    ". we can safely neglect @xmath84 for the reason that on account of @xmath85 its contribution to the decay rate is proportional to the ratio @xmath86 , where @xmath87 represents the mass of the lepton ( @xmath88 or @xmath89 ) in the final state and @xmath90 that of the baryon in the initial state .",
    "the form factor @xmath91 is equal to 0 in the chiral limit .",
    "it gets the first nonvanishing contribution in the linear order in @xmath92 .",
    "the inclusion of this effect in the discussion of the hyperon decays would require reanalyzing the experimental data , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , the model calculations show that the @xmath92 contribution to @xmath91 enters with relatively small numerical coefficient , which means that the numerical error due to the neglect of @xmath91 in the full fledged analysis of the hyperon decays is small .",
    "it is already well known how to treat hadronic matrix elements such as @xmath93 within the @xmath55qsm ( see for example @xcite and references therein . ) . taking into account the @xmath94 rotational and @xmath95 corrections , we can write the resulting axial - vector constants @xmath96 in the following form . ] : @xmath97 .",
    "\\label{eq : g1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) stand for the @xmath100-th ( third ) component of the spin operator of the baryons .",
    "the @xmath101 denote the su(3 ) wigner matrices in representation @xmath102 .",
    "the @xmath103 denote parameters depending on the specific dynamics of the chiral soliton model .",
    "their explicit form in terms of a goldstone mean field can be found in ref .",
    "as mentioned already , in the present approach we will not calculate this mean field but treat @xmath103 as free parameters to be adjusted to experimentally known semileptonic hyperon decays .",
    "because of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking due to the strange quark mass @xmath104 , the collective baryon hamiltonian is no more su(3)-symmetric .",
    "the octet states are mixed with the higher representations such as antidecuplet @xmath105 and eikosiheptaplet @xmath106  @xcite . in the linear order in @xmath95 the wave function of a state @xmath107 of spin @xmath108",
    "is given as : @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "mixing parameters @xmath111 can be found for example in ref .",
    "they are given as products of a numerical constant @xmath112 depending on the quantum numbers of the baryonic state @xmath113 and dynamical parameter @xmath114 depending linearly on @xmath95 ( which we assume to be 180  mev ) and the model parameter @xmath115 , which is responsible for the splitting between the octet and higher exotic multiplets  @xcite .",
    "analogously to eq.([eq : g1 ] ) one obtains in the @xmath56qsm diagonal axial - vector coupling constants . in that case",
    "@xmath116 can take two values : @xmath117 and @xmath118 . for @xmath119 ( singlet axial - vector current )",
    "we have the following expression @xcite : @xmath120    this equation is remarkable , since it provides a link between an octet and singlet axial - vector current .",
    "it is perhaps the most important model input in our analysis .",
    "pure qcd - arguments based the large @xmath121 expansion  @xcite do not provide such a link .    a remark",
    "concerning constants @xmath103 is here in order .",
    "coefficient @xmath122 contains terms which are leading and subleading in the large @xmath59 expansion .",
    "the presence of the subleading terms enhances the numerical value of @xmath122 calculated in the @xmath56qsm for the self - consistent profile and makes model predictions _",
    "e.g. _ for @xmath123 remarkably close to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "this feature , although very important for the model phenomenology , does not concern us here , since our procedure is based on fitting all coefficients @xmath103 from the data .",
    "constants @xmath124 and @xmath125 are both subleading in @xmath126 and come from the anomalous part of the effective chiral action in euclidean space . in the skyrme model they are related to the wess - zumino term .",
    "however , in the simplest version of the skyrme model ( which is based on the pseudo - scalar mesons only ) @xmath127 identically @xcite . in the case of the @xmath56qsm @xmath128",
    "and it provides a link between the su(3 ) octet of axial - vector currents and the singlet current of eq.([eq : singlet ] ) .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that in the limit of the artificially large soliton , which corresponds to the `` skyrme limit '' of the present model , @xmath129 in agreement with @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , for small solitons @xmath130 reproducing the result of the non - relativistic quark model .    so instead of calculating 7 dynamical parameters @xmath131 and @xmath115 ( which enters into @xmath132 and @xmath133 ) within the @xmath56qsm , we shall fit them from the hyperon semileptonic decays data .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following set of 7 new parameters : @xmath134 @xmath135    employing this new set of parameters , we can express all possible semileptonic decays of the octet baryons .",
    "explicit formulae can be found in the appendix ( see eq.([eq : semilep ] ) ) .",
    "let us finally note that there is certain redundancy in eq.([eq : semilep ] ) , namely by redefinition of @xmath100 and @xmath136 we can get rid of the variable @xmath137 : @xmath138 so there are 6 free parameters which have to be fitted from the data .",
    "> from eq.([eq : semilep ] ) , we can easily find that in the chiral limit the following eight sum rules for @xmath139 exist : @xmath140 only the first 4 sum rules ( [ srchi ] ) contain known decays , and the accuracy here is not worse than 10 % .",
    "apparently the symmetry breaking of su(3 ) has only a small effect on the semileptonic decays .    with",
    "the linear @xmath95 corrections turned on , we end up with only four sum rules : @xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143    however , more experimental data are required to verify eq.([eq : sum2 ] ) .",
    "as we have demonstrated in the preceding section , the amplitudes of the hyperon decays are described in the @xmath56qsm by 6 free parameters .",
    "there are 2 _ chiral _ ones : @xmath144 and @xmath145 , and 4 proportional to @xmath95 : @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 .",
    "since there are 6 known hyperon decays , we can express all model parameters as linear combinations of these decay constants , and subsequently all quantities of interest can be expressed in terms of the input amplitudes . in the following",
    "we will use the experimental values of refs .",
    "@xcite , which are presented in table i.    before doing this , let us , however , observe that there exist two linear combinations of the decay amplitudes which are free of the @xmath95 corrections ( within the model ) : @xmath150 where @xmath25 stand for the decay constants in short - hand notation ( see table i ) . solving eq.([rs0 ] ) for @xmath144 and @xmath145 , we obtain the _ chiral - limit _ (",
    "i.e. with @xmath151 ) expressions for hyperon decays and integrated quark densities .",
    "the numerical values obtained in this way can be found in tables i and ii .",
    "reexpressing @xmath144 and @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 in terms of the @xmath25 s allows us to write down the integrated quark densities as : @xmath152    the two least known amplitudes @xmath153 and @xmath154 are almost entirely responsible for the errors quoted in tables i and ii .",
    "however , since the coefficients which enter into eq.([uds0 ] ) are not too large , the absolute errors are relatively small .    in table",
    "ii the yet unmeasured hyperon semileptonic decay constants are listed .",
    "the @xmath155 channel is particularly interesting , since its measurement will be soon announced by the ktev collaboration  @xcite .",
    "forming linear combinations of the quark densities we obtain the _ chiral limit _",
    "expressions for @xmath156 and @xmath0 : @xmath157 the numerical values together with the error bars are listed in table ii .",
    "the full expressions are obtained by solving the remaining 4 equations for @xmath95 dependent parameters @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "also in this case we are able to link integrated quark densities @xmath21 to the hyperon decays : @xmath158 it is interesting to observe that the amplitudes @xmath153 and in particular @xmath159 come with relatively large weight in the expression for @xmath4 , whereas @xmath160 and @xmath161 are much less affected by the relatively large experimental error of these two decays .",
    "this is explicitly seen in fig.1 , where we plot the central values and error bars of @xmath21 s . in the same figure",
    "we draw central values and errors of @xmath21 s in the _ chiral limit _ as given by eq.([uds0 ] ) . to guide the eye we have restored the linear dependence on the symmetry breaking @xmath95 corrections assuming @xmath162  mev , as done in ref.@xcite .",
    "we can first see that our results in the chiral limit correspond to typical su(3)-symmetric values : @xmath163 and @xmath164 . however , the result for individual integrated quark densities , where the model prediction for the singlet current @xmath61 plays a role , are beyond the typical su(3 ) symmetry values . only when the chiral symmetry breaking is taken into account the central values for @xmath21 s",
    "are shifted towards the `` standard '' values .",
    "unfortunately the error of @xmath4 becomes 7 times larger than the one of @xmath160 or @xmath161 , so that at this stage we are not able to make any firm conclusion concerning the value of @xmath4 .",
    "it is perhaps more interesting to look directly at the combinations relevant for the polarized scattering experiments , which take the following form : @xmath165 in fig.2 we plot @xmath156 and @xmath0 both for the chiral symmetry fit and for the full fit of eq.([gdsfull ] ) , together with experimental data for the proton and neutron .",
    "again , to guide the eye we have restored the linear dependence of the symmetry breaking @xmath95 corrections .",
    "we see that despite the large uncertainty of @xmath4 , we get reasonable values for @xmath42 and @xmath166 .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly we see , that @xmath0 is almost independent of the chiral symmetry breaking and stays within the range @xmath167 , if the errors of the hyperon decays are taken into account .",
    "@xmath168 of the experimental error of @xmath0 comes from the two least known hyperon decays @xmath169 ( corresponding to @xmath170 and @xmath154 ) .",
    "it is interesting to see how @xmath171 and @xmath4 are correlated . to this end , instead of using two last hyperon decays @xmath153 and @xmath154 as input , we use the experimental value for @xmath42 as given by eq.([gampval ] ) and @xmath171 , which we vary in the range from 0 to 1 . in fig.3",
    "we plot our prediction for the two amplitudes @xmath153 and @xmath154 ( solid lines ) , together with the experimental error bands for these two decays .",
    "it is clearly seen from fig.3 that the allowed region for @xmath171 , in which the theoretical prediction falls within the experimental error bars amounts to @xmath172 .",
    "in fig.4 we plot the variation of @xmath21 s with respect to @xmath173 ( with @xmath42 fixed by eq.([gampval ] ) ) .",
    "we see that @xmath160 and @xmath161 are relatively stable , whereas @xmath4 exhibits rather strong dependence on @xmath0 . within the allowed region",
    "@xmath174 strange quark density @xmath4 varies between @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "interestingly , in the central region around @xmath177 strange quark density vanishes in accordance with an intuitive assumption of ellis and jaffe  @xcite .",
    "identical behavior and include higher order qcd corrections . ]",
    "( shown in fig.4 by a dash - dotted line ) was obtained by lichtenstadt and lipkin in an analysis of the hyperon decays in which no model for @xmath0 has been used @xcite . indeed",
    "( assuming only the first order qcd corrections ) , the identity : @xmath178 allows one to calculate @xmath0 in terms of @xmath179 ( or equivalently @xmath4 ) by using @xmath180 and @xmath42 as an additional input . in the @xmath56qsm and",
    "also in large @xmath121 qcd one can express @xmath181 in terms of the known hyperon semileptonic decays : @xmath182 equation ( [ nomodel1 ] ) gives @xmath183 , remarkably close to the @xmath56qsm prediction in which model formula for @xmath0 is used .",
    "this is , in our opinion , another strong argument in support for the model formula for @xmath184 .",
    "in this paper we studied the influence of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking in semileptonic hyperon decays on the determination of the integrated polarized quark densities @xmath21 . using the chiral quark soliton model we have obtained a satisfactory parametrization of all available experimental data on semileptonic decays . in this respect",
    "our analysis is identical to the large @xmath185 qcd analysis of ref.@xcite . using 6",
    "known hyperon decays we have predicted @xmath26 for the decays not yet measured .",
    "the new ingredient of our analysis consists in using the model formula for the singlet axial - vector current in order to make contact with the high energy polarization experiments .",
    "we have argued that our model interpolates between the quark model ( the small soliton limit ) and the skyrme model ( large soliton limit ) @xcite reproducing the value of @xmath0 in these two limiting cases @xcite",
    ". this unique feature , and also the numerical agreement with the analysis of ref.@xcite as discussed at the end of the last section , make us believe that our approach contains all necessary physics needed to analyze the symmetry breaking not only for the octet axial - vector currents , but also in the case of the singlet one .",
    "the model contains 6 free parameters which can be fixed by 6 known hyperon decays .",
    "unfortunately @xmath26 for the two known decays of @xmath3 have large experimental errors , which influence our predictions for @xmath21 .",
    "our strategy was very simple : using model parametrization we expressed @xmath21 s , @xmath156 and @xmath68 in terms of the six known hyperon decays .",
    "errors were added in quadrature .    first observation which should be made",
    "is that we reproduce @xmath156 as measured in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "we obtain @xmath186 and @xmath187 , however , @xmath4 is practically undetermined being equal to @xmath188 .",
    "this large error is entirely due to the experimental errors of the @xmath3 decays , which also make @xmath68 to lie between 0.1 and 0.9 .",
    "there are two points which have to be stressed here .",
    "our fit respects chiral symmetry in a sense that the leading order parameters @xmath144 and @xmath145 ( or equivalently @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) are fitted to the linear combinations of the hyperon decays which are free from @xmath51 corrections . had we used this su(3 ) symmetric parametrization as given by eq.([rs0 ] ) we would not be able to reproduce ( as far as the central values are concerned ) @xmath156 . with @xmath51 corrections turned on we hit experimental values for @xmath156 , however , as stated above , the value of @xmath0 is practically undetermined , due the the experimental error of @xmath3 decays .",
    "therefore to confirm or invalidate our analysis it is of utmost importance to have better data for these decays . since we predict that @xmath189 the forthcoming experimental result for the latter decay @xcite will provide a test of our approach .",
    "if the future data on this and on other decays will disagree with the predictions of our analysis ( in which dynamical quantities are _ fitted _ to the existing data rather than _ calculated _ in the model ) , that would also mean that the model ( with dynamical quantities _ calculated _ ) fails for these particular observables .",
    "it would be then the signal for the model builders that presumably there were some physical effects which had been not included in the present version of the model .",
