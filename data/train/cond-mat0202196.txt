    "in recent years , there has been a great interest in the study of fully frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnets ( haf ) , both from the experimental and theoretical point of view@xcite .",
    "these systems often show unconventional ground - states , noncollinear , incommensurate@xcite or disordered@xcite . in these systems , the classical mean field ( mf ) description indicates a macroscopic ground - state degeneracy and no long range order is predicted .",
    "this property is directly related to the extensive number of degrees of freedom that still fluctuate at low temperature@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in many cases , thermal or quantum fluctuations give rise to an entropic selection within the ground state manifold , known as `` order by disorder''@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon may induce a selection of a subset of the continuous degenerate ground states as it does for the kagom antiferromagnet@xcite , and sometimes can even select a particular ground state as it is the case for the face centered cubic ( fcc ) antiferromagnet@xcite . among these systems ,",
    "the 3d pyrochlore lattice is of particular interest since it does not display such `` order by disorder '' and remains disordered down to zero temperature@xcite .",
    "it consists in a three dimensional arrangement of corner - sharing tetrahedra ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "all magnetic compounds which cristallize in the pyrochlore structure exhibit unusual magnetic properties . a few order at",
    "well defined nel temperature @xcite while many of them behave as spin glasses despite the high degree of stoichiometry@xcite .",
    "the pyrochlore lattice.,width=264 ]    in the heisenberg antiferromagnetic @xmath5 quantum case , the pyrochlore lattice exhibits no magnetic transition even at t=0k , and behaves as a spin - liquid .",
    "the spin - spin correlation length never exceeds the inter atomic distance and it is expected that there is a continuum of singlet states within the singlet - triplet gap@xcite . for classical heisenberg spins , monte carlo simulations have shown that the pyrochlore haf also behaves as a spin - liquid , with short ranged spin correlations both in space and time@xcite , which allows for its description to take into account only the tetrahedral unit cell@xcite . the exactly solvable infinite - component spin vector model on the pyrochlore lattice also does not order down to zero temperature@xcite .",
    "classical models providing much informations close to the characteristics obtained in the quantum case , it indicates that the low - energy physics in the pyrochlore structure is mainly related to the geometry of the lattice .",
    "an interesting aspect of the problem is to study how this disordered classical ground - state resists to perturbations as it could enlarge its observation in real compounds .",
    "it has been shown that ordering is very easily induced either by including further neighbour interaction@xcite or easy plane anisotropy@xcite or lattice deformations@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the effect of coupling the spins of the pyrochlore net to the remaining nearest - neighbor ( n.n ) spins in the fcc net via standard classical monte carlo ( mc ) calculations .",
    "the question is wether the system will select an ordered state when switching on this coupling or maintain disorder as in the pyrochlore haf .",
    "as obtained in previous works , an energetic comparison of all magnetic phases at the mf level already lifts the degeneracy and strongly supports that any deviations from the pyrochlore limit will drive the system to an ordered state ( sec .",
    "[ pyro - fcc ] ) .",
    "but strikingly , it is shown that thermal fluctuations do not select the expected mean field ground state but prefer a collinear phase which is more stable from the entropic point of view ( sec .  [ mc - results ] ) .",
    "in both fcc and pyrochlore lattices , the classical energy is minimized by any configuration for which the total spin of each elementary tetrahedron in the lattice is zero .",
    "the main difference in the ground - states of these two lattices comes from the fact that in the fcc net the ordering at one tetrahedron will select a unique global ordering , while in the pyrochlore net , since the tetrahedra are more sparsely connected , there remains an extensive number of degrees of freedom@xcite . in the fcc haf",
    ", the mf ground - states are degenerate along the @xmath7 direction in reciprocal space .",
    "thermal fluctuations break this degeneracy and select the collinear ordered phase @xmath8@xcite .",
    "these results have been confirmed by standard monte carlo simulations@xcite which show evidence for a first order phase transition . in the pure pyrochlore haf ,",
    "the mf ground - states are degenerate throughout the entire brillouin zone .",
    "numerical works have shown that no long - range order occurs at nonzero termperature in that case , even in a regime where the temperature is below the energy scale set by interaction@xcite . in between these two limits",

    "we have first studied the mf ground - states degeneracy for small @xmath25 .",
    "one way to do so is to compute the fourier transform of the interactions on the lattice , @xmath26 .",

    "we started from both random and ordered initial configurations . in each run , up to @xmath47 mc steps per spin have been discarded for equilibrating and up to @xmath48 mc steps per spins have been used for averaging .",
    "we have checked that our simulations reproduce the monte - carlo results for the pyrochlore net@xcite and those for the fcc net@xcite . in order to determine unambigously whether the @xmath6 fcc haf order or not , we have measured more specifically the specific heat per spin and a correlation function which quantify the collinearity of spins .    an unbiaised way to look for",
    "fluctuations induced order is to measure heat capacity , since it is very sensitive to the presence of zero modes ( modes whose energy is independent of displacement to second order at all wave vectors)@xcite . from the classical equipartition theory ,",
    "quadratic modes contribute a factor @xmath49 to the partition function z , while quartic modes contibute a factor @xmath50 : at low temperature , the behavior is thus dominated by fluctuations around the ground - states with the largest number of zero modes .",
    "these zero modes leave a signature in the heat capacity ( since they contribute to @xmath51 instead of @xmath52 for the quadratic modes ) that can be checked with monte carlo simulations .    in the n.n .",
