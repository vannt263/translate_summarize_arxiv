    "in order to better understand fully quantum estimation and control , a number recent papers have introduced a class of coherent quantum observers for linear quantum stochastic systems ; see @xcite . also , the paper @xcite considers a finite level quantum system as the quantum plant , which is described in the form of bilinear quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) ; see @xcite .",
    "this means that the combined plant observer system is a hybrid of a finite level quantum system and a linear quantum system ; see @xcite .",
    "the coherent observers discussed in @xcite track the plant variables asymptotically in the sense of mean values . also , entanglement can be generated in the joint plant - observer quantum systems @xcite .    in the papers @xcite ,",
    "the quantum plant under consideration is a linear quantum system . in recent years",
    ", there has been considerable interest in the modeling and feedback control of linear quantum systems ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "such linear quantum systems commonly arise in the area of quantum optics ; e.g. , see @xcite . for such linear quantum system models an important class of quantum control problems",
    "are referred to as coherent quantum feedback control problems ; e.g. , see @xcite . in these coherent quantum feedback control problems , both the plant and the controller",
    "are quantum systems .",
    "the coherent quantum observer problem can be regarded as a special case of the coherent quantum feedback control problem in which the objective of the observer is track the system variables of the quantum plant .    in the previous papers on quantum observers such as @xcite ,",
    "the coupling between the plant and the observer is via a field coupling .",
    "this leads to an observer structure of the form shown in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "this enables a one way connection between the quantum plant and the quantum observer .",
    "also , since both the quantum plant and the quantum observer are open quantum systems , they are both subject to quantum noise .        in the paper @xcite , a coherent quantum control problem is considered in which both field coupling and direct coupling is considered between the quantum plant and the quantum controller .",
    "also , the paper @xcite considered a direct coupling quantum observer in which there is only direct coupling between the quantum plant and the quantum observer and for which both the plant and the observer are linear quantum systems corresponding to quantum harmonic oscillators . in this paper , we consider the construction of a coherent quantum observer in which there is only direct coupling between quantum plant and the quantum observer . also , the plant is assumed to be a finite level quantum system corresponding to a single qubit and the observer is assumed to be a linear quantum system corresponding to a single quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "furthermore , both the quantum plant and the quantum observer are assumed to be closed quantum systems which means that they are not subject to quantum noise and are purely deterministic systems .",
    "this leads to an observer structure of the form shown in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "it is shown that for the case being considered , a quantum observer can be constructed to estimate one of the system variables of the quantum plant . in particular , an observer variable converges to the plant variable being estimated in a time averaged sense .",

    "this is not surprising since the behavior of the direct coupled quantum observers considered in this paper and the behavior of quantum measurements are both determined by the quantum commutation relations which are fundamental to the theory of quantum mechanics .",
