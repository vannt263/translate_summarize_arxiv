    "of the particles seen so far in collider experiments , the top quark is no doubt the most expensive , and the most glamorous .",
    "it is therefore the center of attention at the tevatron and the lhc , until of course a new star , higgs , comes along .",
    "expressed less colloquially , the top quark is considered an interesting study object because it has many quantum numbers and thus couples to almost all other particles , through various ( chiral , vector , scalar ) structures , all of which bear scrutiny for deviations .",
    "precise scrutiny is feasible because the large top mass implies , first , that it couples strongly to whatever breaks the electroweak symmetry , and second , the resulting large width minimizes obscuring hadronization effects and allows preservation of spin information .",
    "top is also a troublemaker for the standard model , contributing significantly to the quadratic divergences of the higgs self energy , but is at the same time an life raft for beyond the standard model ( bsm ) theories such as the mssm ( raising the upper limit on the light higgs in that theory ) . with",
    "the tevatron having made the first precious thousands top quarks , leading to its discovery and ftests of some of its properties , the lhc is a genuine top quark factory and will allow us to study the top quark in great detail . here",
    "i review some of the interesting aspects of top quark physics .",
    "i will necessarily be short on length and details , and i refer to other excellent recent reviews @xcite for more .",
    "let us recall the various interactions of the top quark field @xmath0 in the standard model lagrangian .",
    "the interaction with gluons is a vectorlike coupling involving an @xmath1 generator in the fundamental representation @xmath2_{ij } t_j(x ) g_\\mu^a(x)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 label color .",
    "the interaction with photons is simply vectorlike and proportional to the top quarks fractional charge @xmath4 its charged weak interaction is chiral and flavor - changing @xmath5 while it neutral weak interaction is flavor - conserving and parity violating @xmath6 the interaction of the top with the higgs boson of the yukawa type @xmath7 with a coupling constant that is directly related to its mass @xmath8 .    beyond these , effective interactions such as for flavor - changing neutral currents , occur due to loop corrections , and are therefore very small .",
    "all of these couplings could be modified in structure and strength by virtual effects due to new interactions associated with physics beyond the standard model .",
    "this is particularly relevant for the top quark if only because it evidently couples strongly to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector ( the yukawa coupling @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) is very close to 1 in strength ) .",
    "it is therefore important to test these structures in detail .",
    "such studies can be guided by educated guesses about possible alternatives to the standard model , and so let us briefly review the role of the top quark or its partners in some bsm models .",
    "if it were nt for the top quark corrections to the lightest higgs boson mass , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) would predict it to be lighter than the @xmath10 boson , and would thus already have been ruled out .",
    "the maximum viable mass for this boson is thus about @xmath11 gev .",
    "top plays an even more central role , in that its dominant contribution to the running of a higgs potential parameter down from the gut scale in fact leads to a negative eigenvalue for the higgs mass matrix , thereby explaining electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "moreover , in the supersymmetry searches at the lhc , both regarding discovery and subsequent unraveling , top would play a key part , as many heavy supersymmetric partners have top among its decay products .",
    "the key idea @xcite is to construct a model in which the higgs boson emerges as a pseudo - goldstone boson , and is therefore naturally light .",
    "this is analogous to explaining the lightness of the pion by its nature as a pseudo - goldstone boson for spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "a number of such little higgs models have in fact now been constructed , see @xcite for a review . in these models",
    "the top quark plays a key role , simply because its contribution to the higgs mass corrections are the most dominant , and must be cancelled to an appropiate extent , i.e. up to a certain scale .",
    "in fact , ambitions here do not run as high as the gut scale ; the goal is to solve at least the `` little hierarchy '' problem , keeping the higgs mass natural up to a scale a factor 10 above what would still be natural for the standard model , up to about 10 tev .",
    "perhaps the most extensively explored model is the littlest higgs model with @xmath12-parity @xcite . here",
    ", heavier mirror copies of the four standard model electroweak gauge fields appear , which cancel the higgs mass contributions of the latter .",
    "likewise , t - odd and t - even fermionic top - partners are introduced whose higgs mass contribution cancel , to one - loop , that of the top .",
    "the heavy top partners , that also decay to tops , could be visible by lhc experiments .      in extra - dimensional scenarios @xcite",
    "top plays less of a central role , as the mechanism for curing the hierarchy problem is not based on particles but spacetime .",
    "nevertheless , the kaluza - klein excited states of gluons might be best visible as resonances in top quark pair production channels , as these are more easily identified .",
    "top has also played a key role in setting up models in which , in analogy with bcs superconductively , the higgs is effectively a fermion ( top ) boundstate , formed by new `` topcolor '' gauge interaction @xcite that views the 3rd generation as special .",
    "evidence for such a mechanism , which would also yield charged and neutral top - pions , and possibly new heavy gauge bosons , could arise in @xmath13 invariant mass distributions . by their nature , these new particles would couple strong to top quarks , and lead to a varied phenomenology involving top final states .",
    "a comprehensive review is ref .",
    "the top quark property that is most readily employed in top physics is its mass .",
    "the tevatron experiments have set the standard to a level that will be hard to pass by the lhc by measuring it to less than 1% accuracy ( @xmath14 gev ) . together with an accurately measured @xmath15 boson mass it severely constrains the mass range of a possible higgs boson both in the standard model and in the mssm .",
    "therefore its precise measurement is of considerable importance , and so also its careful definition .",
    "a natural definition is based on the location of the pole of the full top quark propagator , the pole mass . however , because the top quark , being colored , can never propagate out to infinite times - a requirement for the definition of a particle mass in scattering - such a pole only exists in perturbation theory , and its location is intrinsically ambiguous by @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "a theoretically more precise definition is the @xmath17 mass @xmath18 whose relation to the pole mass is known to sufficiently high order . for @xmath19 one often takes the implicit value found when intersecting the @xmath18 curve with the @xmath20 axis , yielding @xmath21 . for the top quark ,",
    "this value is about 10 gev smaller than the pole mass , and thus the question often arises what mass the tevatron and lhc experiments measure .",
    "experimentally , the top quark mass is reconstructed by collecting jets and leptons .",
    "soft particles arising from both within and outside these jets may enter them , and thus affect the reconstructed mass . moreover",
    ", various experimental methods used ( e.g. track quality cuts ) , and monte carlo based corrections , do not have a clean perturbation theory description .",
    "therefore the question is difficult to answer , but the pole mass should be the closest to the true answer .",
    "the top quark inclusive cross section at hadron colliders has been a constant of theoretical attention over many years , with steady progress toward its more accurate determination .",
    "let us look at some recent developments , for which we need a brief discussion on threshold resummation .",
    "when the top quark pair is produced near threshold , logarithms whose argument represents the distance to threshold in the perturbative series become numerically large . it is important to note here that the definition of the threshold depends on the observable .",
    "thus , for the inclusive cross section threshold is given by @xmath22 .",
    "for the transverse momentum distribution we have @xmath23 , and for the doubly differential distribution in @xmath24 and rapidity we have @xmath25 .",
    "the perturbative series for any of these ( differential ) cross sections can be expressed as @xmath26 plus non - logarithmic terms . here",
    "@xmath27 represents any of the threshold conditions , suitably normalized , for the observables enumerated by @xmath28 .",
    "note that it is of course allowed to use e.g. @xmath29 for the inclusive cross section , by first analyzing @xmath30 and then integrating over @xmath24 .",
    "for any complete fixed order calculation this will give the same answer , but if one only selects the logarithmic terms because the exact answer is unknown , numerical differences will occur which can be seen as an theoretical uncertainty @xcite .    the logarithms result from phase space regions where the extra gluons emitted are soft and/or collinear to their massless , on - shell emitter .",
    "resummation concerns itself with carrying out the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) . to this end",
    "it is often convenient , in order to account for momentum or energy conservation conditions , to take moments with respect to @xmath27 @xmath31 the resummed result then takes the generic form @xmath32 after resummation , the inverse transform to eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) should be taken . including up to the function @xmath33 in the exponent amounts to n@xmath34ll resummation",
    ". not surprisingly , for higher @xmath35 these functions are progressively more difficult to determine .",
    "key benefits of resummation are ( i ) gaining all - order control of the terms that make using fixed - order perturbation theory unreliable , thereby restoring predictive power , and ( ii ) reduction of scale uncertainty . for drell - yan or higgs production via gluon fusion",
    ", the threshold is @xmath36 , and the resummed partonic cross section has the form @xcite @xmath37\\,.\\ ] ] the function @xmath38 is the cusp anomalous dimension and controls soft and collinear radiation , while @xmath39 includes contributions from soft , wide - angle emissions .",
    "both are known to 3rd order .",
    "the resummed top quark pair production cross sections with threshold @xmath40 is similar in form , but here @xmath41 is a matrix in color space .",
    "most of the latest theoretical estimates for the inclusive pair production cross sections take threshold resummation to a certain accuracy into account .",
    "furthermore , uncertainties due to scale variables ( lessened by the resummation ) , and the pdf s are included .",
    "it should be said however that , while the top is always pair - produced fairly close to threshold at the tevatron , at the lhc this is not necessarily true , and hence the impact of threshold - resummation is smaller .",
    "thus , cacciari et al . in @xcite",
    "update their earlier @xcite estimates for the inclusive pair production cross section for a range of masses , for number of pdf sets , and for both nlo and nlo+nll cross sections .",
    "they find that at the lhc the scale uncertainties are significantly larger than the pdf uncertainties , and that it is important to vary the renormalization @xmath42 and factorization scale @xmath43 independently .",
    "nadolsky et al in ref.@xcite , in the context of using the cteq6.6 set , examine the potential of the @xmath13 cross section as a gluon density probe , and its role in normalizing certain classes of lhc cross sections .",
    "kidonakis and vogt @xcite derive nnlo estimates for the inclusive cross section from the nll resummmation for the double differential cross section , and include uncertainties due to pdf , scale , and kinematics choice . moch and uwer @xcite also update the nlo - nll results of the results in ref .",
    "@xcite and then extend the resummation accuracy to nnll , using threshold @xmath40 .",
    "the required 3-loop @xmath38 @xcite and the 2-loop @xmath44 which they were able to constitute from the drell - yan and higgs equivalent functions @xcite , and results and insights from refs .",
    "@xcite . from this result",
    "they construct a second order estimate for the @xmath13 inclusive cross section of the form @xmath45 with @xmath46 all known , including the coulomb corrections .",
    "furthermore , all scale - dependent logartithms , constructed using renormalization group methods , were included .",
    "a much reduced scale uncertainty was found , albeit for @xmath43 and @xmath42 held equal .",
    "results such as those above serve to whet the appetite for an exact nnlo calculation for the inclusive cross section , and also on this front much progress is being made .",
    "the real calculations are now available , thanks in large measure to having the nlo @xmath47 available @xcite .",
    "the 2-loop virtual corrections are have been obtained in the limit @xmath48 from both factorization - based calculations @xcite , and direct calculation using semi - automatized mellin - barnes techniques @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite , the first full 2-loop virtual results have been derived .",
    "the exact nnlo calculation seems to be no longer infinitely far on the horizon .",
    "single tops are produced by the weak interaction , in processes that are customarily categorized ( fig .",
    "[ fig : singletopprocesses ] ) using born kinematics .",
    "-channel ( 1 ) , @xmath49-channel ( 2 ) processes , and the @xmath50 associated ( 3 ) production channel . ]    a particularly interesting aspect of single - top production is the prospect of directly measuring @xmath51 and testing the chiral structure of the associated vertex : top produced singly in this way is highly polarized , and offers a chance to study its spin .",
    "furthermore , the dominant @xmath49 channel at the lhc will , when confronting measurements with a 5-flavor nlo calculation , allow extraction of the @xmath52-quark density .",
    "this will be useful in predicting other production processes at the lhc .",
    "the single top production characteristics are sensitive to new physics , depending on the channel .",
    "thus , the @xmath53-channel will be sensitive to e.g. @xmath54 resonances , the @xmath49-channel to fcnc s .",
    "experimentally , this process turns out to be very difficult to extract from backgrounds , and so far only ( strong ) evidence has been found by the d0 @xcite and cdf @xcite collaborations , with 95% cl lower limits on @xmath51 of 0.68 and 0.66 , resp .",
    "the measured cross sections agree within errors with the nlo calculations @xcite .",
    "the inclusive cross sections at the tevatron are rather small , 0.9 ( @xmath53 ) and 2 ( @xmath49 ) pb , with the @xmath50 channel negligible . at the lhc the numbers are ,",
    "approximately , 10 , 246 and 60 pb , respectively .",
    "clearly at the lhc , the @xmath49-channel will be dominant .",
    "besides interesting in its own right , this process is a background to putative new physics processes , such as higgs production in association with a @xmath15 boson .",
    "while the inclusive cross section has received much theoretical and experimental attention , the interest in distributions in certain variables is increasing , given the increased tevatron data set , and the lhc start .",
    "let us review some recent developments .",
    "the charge asymmetry is the difference in production rate for top and anti - top at fixed angle or rapidity .",
    "while electroweak production via a @xmath10-boson could produce a ( very small ) asymmetry at lo , qcd itself does produce it at @xmath55 through a term proportional to the su(3 ) @xmath56 symbol @xcite cdf and d0 have recently performed first measurements , albeit with still large uncertainties of this asymmetry @xcite .",
    "thus , the impact of even higher orders becomes interesting which at this stage can only be assessed from approximate , resummation based calculations @xcite , and was studied in ref .",
    "the asymmetry was found to be stable with respect to including such higher order corrections , and to be much less sensitive to scale variations . at the lhc , where the @xmath57 channel dominates , the asymmetry is naturally small , but may be enhanced at large invariant mass , where the @xmath58 channel regains strength .",
    "the charge asymmetry is present at leading order in @xmath59 production .",
    "however , nlo corrections @xcite appear to wash out the asymmetry for this reaction .",
    "another important distribution for both the tevatron and the lhc is in the invariant mass @xmath60 .",
    "the standard model shape has relatively small uncertainty but is sensitive to the top mass , and may thus assist in determining it .",
    "shape deviations from the qcd predictions in this distribution ( peaks , peak - dip structures ) are telltales of new physics , such as resonances with various spin , parity and color quantum numbers .",
    "a study employing the flexibility of madgraph in a bottom - up approach was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which only the most generic aspects of new models are used .",
    "[ fig : mttbar ] @xcite contains the invariant mass distribution for a number of @xmath53-channel resonances , showing indeed marked dependence on the quantum numbers of the resonance .",
    "part of the attractiveness of the top quark as a study object is its power to self - analyze its spin , through its purely left - handed sm weak decay .",
    "this is both a useful aid in signal - background separations , and itself a property worthy of detailed scrutiny , as certain new physics models could introduce right - handed parts .",
    "the correlation between top spin and directional emission probability for its decay products is expressed through @xmath61 where @xmath62 , with 1 indication 100% correlation .",
    "the dominant decay mode @xmath63 at lowest order , we have @xmath64 . qcd corrections to these values",
    "are small .",
    "the charged lepton direction ( or the down - type quark in a hadronic decay of the intermediate @xmath15 ) is indeed 100% correlated with the top quark spin .",
    "this is amusingly more than for its parent @xmath15 boson , a consequence of interference of two amplitudes with different @xmath15 polarizations .    in single - top quark production , which occurs via the charged weak interaction ,",
    "the top is produced left - handed , so a correlation should be a clear feature of the production process and a discriminant from the background . in fig .",
    "[ fig : stspincorr ] this correlation as computed with mc@nlo @xcite is shown .",
    "-channel single - top production at the tevatron , a clear correlation of the lepton flight direction with the recoiling light quark jet .",
    "the correlation disappears when spin - correlations are turned off in mc@nlo @xcite . ]    in top quark pair production a correlation of an individual quark with a fixed direction is almost absent , however there is a clear correlation between the top and anti - top spins .",
    "the size of the correlation depends on the choice of reference axes @xmath65 @xcite . at the tevatron",
    "the beam direction @xmath66 is good choice , at the lhc the helicity axes @xmath67 should give near - maximal correlation @xmath68 indeed , the correlation coefficient @xmath69 depends in fact on the correlation axis .",
    "thus , at lo in qcd , the values for @xmath70 at the tevatron ( lhc ) is @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "nlo corrections modify these number somewhat @xcite .",
    "bsm models that influence the pair production mechanism ( e.g. new resonances ) could noticeably influence these correlations .",
    "many interesting top producing reactions produce other particles in association .",
    "these reactions allow new tests of the top sm interactions , such as its coupling to the photon , @xmath10 or higgs boson",
    ".    among the most interesting is @xmath73 , which , if a good sample can be isolated , would allow a direct determination of the top yukawa coupling ( the sm value is very close to 1 ) . while it may take some time to gather sufficient data that allow the higgs to be cleanly identified and reconstructed ( via the @xmath74 decay mode ) and backgrounds",
    "may be large .",
    "a nlo calculation has been carried out @xcite using a variety of methods , the @xmath75 kinematics with different masses of the final state particles making the calculations challenging .",
    "study of associated production with an electroweak boson could reveal anomalous couplings with the top , different from those in section [ sec : top - quark - standard ] .",
    "robust theoretical tools exist @xcite which will allow fairly accurate determinations of these couplings using lhc data .",
    "production of @xmath13 with a jet is another interesting reaction .",
    "correlations of the top quarks with the extra jet in the final state in this process can yield a more detailed understanding the top quark reactions .",
    "as such it is a also an important background to bsm processes .",
    "a nlo calculation was completed recently @xcite .",
    "its role in the nnlo inclusive cross section calculation and the determination of the charge asymmetry have been mentioned already .",
    "it is interesting to note that in order to prevent errors in the face of severe technical complexities , the calculation was purposely carried out , within one collaboration , in two , fully independent calculational chains .",
    "perhaps the most widely useful progress in describing top quark processes at hadron colliders is in the realm of monte carlo .",
    "efforts in recent years have led to descriptions beyond @xmath76 processes in lo qcd ( with subsequent decay and parton showering ) in general purpose monte carlo programs .",
    "these fall short when extra hard jets are present besides the top quarks , nor are they intrinsically normalized as their only scale dependence in the coupling , with no compensating terms in the matrix element . much ingenuity and labor has been brought to bear to remedy these deficiences .",
    "let us review some of this .",
    "higher - multiplicity matrix element monte carlo s now reach @xmath13 plus up to six jets , and use a variety of methods .",
    "alpgen ( @xmath77 jets ) does not use feynman diagrams but recursion relations to compute the matrix element .",
    "comphep ( @xmath78 jets ) uses squared amplitudes .",
    "madgraph / madevent ( @xmath79 jets ) uses complex helicity amplitudes .",
    "however , while matrix element monte carlo s improve the description of radiative hard emission emission events , they should if possible not sacrifice the power of the parton showers to account for collinear and soft radiation .",
    "matching procedures have been defined to this end .",
    "ckkw @xcite uses @xmath80 clustering to separate phase space into two regions in each of which one of the descriptions should hold . to match properly , the matrix elements are reweighted by sudakov form factors and @xmath81 factors at the scales correspond to the nodal branchings . on the ps side , the showers are vetoed to ensure that only emissions below the matching scale are included .",
    "mlm @xcite also reweights the matrix elements , then showers them , but discards events where the shower generates emission harder than the matching scale .",
    "both procedures have been implemented in a number of matrix - element event generators , and extensively compared @xcite .",
    "other very important progress has been in made in matching nlo to parton shower - based monte carlo ( mc@nlo @xcite and powheg @xcite ) .",
    "matching is essentially an issue of avoiding double counting in the one - emission contribution , which can either come from nlo or from the ps , and in the virtual parts , between the virtual nlo part and the sudakov form factors .",
    "mc@nlo matches , in practice , to herwig angular - ordered showers .",
    "the benefit of this matching is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : pttpair ] @xcite .     @xcite . ]",
    "a small percentage of the events mc@nlo generates have a negative weight , reflecting virtual contributions and subtractions present in nlo and matching .",
    "powheg insists on having positive weights , and exponentiates the complete first order real matrix element to that end .",
    "both these frameworks are growing in the list of processes , and realism ( e.g. spin correlations @xcite ) .",
    "agreement is generally very good , see fig .",
    "[ fig : psnlotoppt ] , also with ps - matched matrix - element generators @xcite , although interesting differences exist .",
    "such differences reflect genuine ambiguities .",
    "an interesting issue arises in the @xmath50 mode of single top production .",
    "some diagrams occurring at nlo contain an intermediate anti - top that can become resonant .",
    "these diagrams can be interpreted as lo @xmath13 `` doubly resonant '' production , with subsequent @xmath82 decay , see fig .",
    "[ fig : wtlo ] .     production . ]",
    "it thus becomes an issue to what extent the @xmath50 and @xmath13 can be properly defined as individual processes .",
    "several definitions of the @xmath50 channel have been given in the literature , each with the aim of recovering a well - behaved expansion in @xmath81 .",
    "the problem of interference in fact affects any computation that considers contributions beyond the leading order , i.e. at least @xmath83 .",
    "the cross section at this order has been previously presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , where only tree - level graphs were considered , and in refs .",
    "@xcite , where one - loop contributions were included as well .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the issue of interference was addressed extensively in the context of event generation , in particular the mc@nlo framework .",
    "two different procedures for subtracting the doubly - resonant contributions and recovering a perturbatively well - behaved @xmath50 cross section were defined . in `` diagram removal ( dr ) '' the graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig : wtlo ] were eliminated from the calculation , while in `` diagram subtraction ( ds ) '' the doubly resonant contribution was removed via a counterterm . while the former method is strictly speaking not gauge - invariant , it was shown , first , that gauge variations are very small , and second that the answer is very close to the gauge invariant second procedure .",
    "the ds procedure leads to the following expression for the cross section @xmath84 where @xmath85 labels the initial state channel in which the doubly - resonant contribution occurs : @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 is the square of the non - resonant diagrams , @xmath88 their interference with the square of graphs of fig .",
    "[ fig : wtlo ] @xmath41 .",
    "the subtraction term @xmath89 requires careful construction .",
    "@xmath90 it was shown that , with suitable cuts , the interference terms are small , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptdrds ] . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) it is straightforward to see that the difference of dr and ds is essentially the interference term . a particularly suitable cut is a puttting a maximum on the @xmath24 of the second hardest @xmath52-flavored hadron , a generalization of a proposal made in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "spectra in dr and ds scheme for lepton from top decay @xcite . ]",
    "thus defined , the @xmath50 and @xmath13 cross sections can be separatedly considered to nlo .",
    "their separation at lhc does remain difficult however .",
    "top quark physics is at present at a pivotal point , between the tevatron and the lhc . as an enterprise it must progress from promising to performing .",
    "the standard model behavior of the top quark has withstood the first tests at the tevatron , and must in the next few years face a barrage of highly detailed and varied tests by the lhc experiments .",
    "top s attractiveness as a study object has by no means diminished . on the contrary ,",
    "new observables are being enlisted to this end .",
    "the characteristics of production and decay , in association with other particles , are very revealing .",
    "top does not hide its spin , and awareness of the importance of studying angular distributions of its decays has grown .",
    "the theoretical tools for top physics studies are good , and keep improving with remarkable pace . with these , and the turn - on of the lhc at the moment of writing , it is a very safe bet indeed to state that the top quark will remain special for years to come .",
