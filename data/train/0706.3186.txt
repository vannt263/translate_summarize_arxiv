    "single trapped and laser - cooled ions are a nearly ideal system for high - resolution laser spectroscopy .",
    "the ion s internal as well as external quantum degrees of freedom can be controlled by coherent laser - atom interactions with high accuracy . at the same time , the ion is well isolated against detrimental influences of a decohering environment .",
    "the combination of these two properties have enabled spectacular ion trap experiments aiming at building better atomic clocks @xcite , creating entangled states @xcite , and processing quantum information @xcite .",
    "the creation of multi - particle entangled atomic states is of interest in the context of quantum information processing but also for laser spectroscopy experiments .",
    "maximally entangled states offer the prospect of improving the signal - to - noise ratio in precision spectroscopy experiments @xcite and they can be used to read out the quantum state of an atom by entangling it with another atom that is easier to detect @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the state space of composite quantum systems made out of two or more atoms , it is sometimes possible to identify subspaces that are decoherence free @xcite with respect to the dominant source of noise in the single - atom system @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that such decoherence - free subspaces allow the preparation of entangled states of two ions with an entanglement lifetime of about one second predominantly limited by spontaneous decay of the involved metastable states @xcite .",
    "these long entanglement lifetimes substantiate the usefulness of entangled states for precision measurements @xcite . in ref",
    ". @xcite we applied this measurement technique to a pair of entangled @xmath1ca@xmath2 ions for a precision measurement of the electric quadrupole moment of the @xmath3 state .",
    "the question arises of whether entanglement is an indispensable ingredient in these measurements . in this paper",
    ", we show that for a pair of correlated atoms coherence times exceeding the single - atom coherence times can be obtained even if the atoms are not entangled .",
    "the technique is applicable to measurements of energy - level shifts and transition frequencies in the presence of correlated noise . after a discussion of the measurement principle , we present two experiments applying the technique to a measurement of an electric quadrupole moment and to a determination of the line width of a narrow - band laser .",
    "in atomic high - resolution spectroscopy , dephasing is often the most important factor limiting the attainable spectral resolution .",
    "possible sources of dephasing are fluctuating electromagnetic fields giving rise to random energy - level shifts but also the finite spectral line width of probe lasers . under these conditions ,",
    "two atoms located in close proximity to each other are likely to experience the same kind of noise , i.e. they are subject to collective decoherence .",
    "the collective character of the decoherence has the important consequence that it does not affect the entangled two - atom state @xmath4 as both parts of the superposition are shifted by the same amount of energy by fluctuating fields . here ,",
    "for the sake of simplicity , @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the ground and excited states of a two - level atom . because of its immunity against collective decoherence ,",
    "the entangled state @xmath7 is much more robust than a single - atom superposition state @xmath8 .",
    "this property makes states like @xmath7 interesting candidates for high - precision spectroscopy . in the following",
    ", we will first discuss how to use bell states for the measurement of energy - level shifts .",
    "then , it will be shown that certain unentangled two - atom states can have similar advantages over single - atom superposition states albeit at lower signal - to - noise ratio .      in a ramsey experiment ,",
    "spectroscopic information is inferred from a measurement of the relative phase @xmath9 of the superposition state @xmath10 .",
    "the phase is measured by mapping the states @xmath11 to the measurement basis @xmath12 by means of a @xmath13 pulse . in close analogy ,",
    "spectroscopy with entangled states is based on a measurement of the relative phase @xmath9 of the bell state @xmath14 . here",
    ", the phase is determined by applying @xmath13 pulses to both atoms followed by state detection .",
    "@xmath13 pulses with the same laser phase on both atoms map the singlet state @xmath15 to itself , whereas the triplet state @xmath16 is mapped to a state @xmath17 with different parity . therefore , measurement of the parity operator @xmath18 yields information about the relative phase since @xmath19 .",
    "if the atomic transition frequencies are not exactly equal but differ by an amount @xmath20 , the phase will evolve as a function of time @xmath21 according to @xmath22 .",
    "then , measurement of the phase - evolution rate provides information about the difference frequency @xmath20 . to keep the notation simple",
    ", it was assumed that in both atoms the same energy levels participated in the superposition state of eq .",
    "( [ bellstate ] ) . in general",
    ", this does not need to be the case and the phase evolution is given by @xmath23 . here",
    ", @xmath24 denote the atomic transition frequencies of atom 1 and atom 2 , and @xmath25 are the laser frequencies used for exciting the corresponding transitions .",
    "the minus sign applies if in the bell state the ground state of atom 1 is associated with an excited state of atom 2 and vice versa . if the bell state is a superposition of both atoms being in the ground state or both in the excited state , the plus sign is appropriate .",
    "one may wonder whether entanglement is absolutely necessary for observing long coherence times in experiments with two atoms .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the kind of measurement outlined above is applicable even to completely unentangled atoms . if the atoms are initially prepared in the product state @xmath26 this state will quickly dephase under the influence of collective phase noise .",
    "the resulting mixed state @xmath27 appears to be composed of the entangled state @xmath7 with a probability of 50% and the two states @xmath28 and @xmath29 with 25% probability each .",
    "if the state @xmath7 is replaced by the density operator @xmath30 in the measurement procedure described in subsection [ sec2:entangled ] , the resulting signal will be the same apart from a 50% loss of contrast .",
    "the states @xmath31 and @xmath32 do not contribute to the signal , since they become equally distributed over all four basis states by the @xmath13 pulses preceding the state detection .",
    "their only effect is to reduce the signal - to - noise ratio by adding quantum projection noise , since only half of the experiments effectively contribute to the signal .",
    "for our experiments , we confine strings of cold @xmath1ca@xmath2 ions in a linear ion trap . the radial confinement with trap frequencies of about @xmath33  mhz is produced by a radio - frequency quadrupole field oscillating at @xmath34  mhz .",
    "the axial center - of - mass frequency @xmath35 is changed from 860  khz to 1720  khz by varying the trap s tip voltages from 500 to 2000 v. for these trapping parameters , the distance between two trapped @xmath1ca@xmath2 ions is between 3.9 @xmath36 m and 6.2 @xmath36 m .",
    "figure [ fig1:ca40 ] shows the lowest energy levels of @xmath1ca@xmath2 , the most important feature being the metastable @xmath37 states with a lifetime of about 1  s. the ions are doppler cooled on the @xmath38 transition .",
    "sideband cooling on the @xmath39 quadrupole transition can be used to prepare a vibrational mode of the ion string in its ground state . at the beginning of each experiment",
    ", the ions are initialized in a pure state by optical pumping .",
    "coherent quantum state manipulation is achieved by laser pulses exciting a single ion on the @xmath40 quadrupole transition .",
    "the ti : sapphire laser used for exciting the transition has a line width of below 50  hz .",
    "its strongly focused beam is rapidly switched from one ion to the next by an electro - optical deflector so that only one ion is interacting with the beam at a time .",
    "we discriminate between the quantum states @xmath41 and @xmath3 by scattering light on the @xmath38 dipole transition and detecting the presence or absence of resonance fluorescence of the individual ions with a ccd camera . for the measurement of operator expectation values , the experiments are typically repeated one hundred times .",
    "a more detailed account of the experimental setup is given in ref .",
    "the measurement technique based on two unentangled atoms can be used for frequency measurement as well as for the detection of energy - level shifts . in the following subsections",
    ", it will be applied to a measurement of magnetic field gradients , to a determination of atomic electric quadrupole shifts and to a measurement of the laser line width of a narrow - band laser .",
    "a magnetic field gradient pointing along the trap axis gives rise to zeeman shifts that are different for all the ions .",
    "this is undesirable in experiments dedicated to quantum information processing as it would necessitate the use of different laser frequencies for performing the same type of operation on different ions . in order to compensate residual magnetic field gradients caused by the stray field of an ion getter pump and by",
    "asymmetrically placed magnetic field coils , we measured the magnetic field gradient by recording parity oscillations of a pair of ions prepared in the state given in eq .",
    "( [ productstate ] ) with @xmath42 and @xmath43 . as in this experiment",
    "the zeeman shift is the only relevant energy - level shift that is position dependent , the gradient was minimized by applying a compensation gradient and minimizing the parity oscillation frequency .",
    "for the chosen energy levels , the dependence of the transition frequency on the magnetic field is given by @xmath44  mhz / g .",
    "ramsey probe times of several hundred milliseconds make it possible to reduce the parity oscillation frequency to below 1  hz .",
    "this corresponds to a difference of the magnetic fields at the location of the ions of less than 0.4  @xmath36 g and to a field gradient of below 0.08  g / m if a typical ion distance of 5  @xmath36 m is assumed .",
    "the precision of the measurement could be further increased by operating the ion trap at much lower axial trap frequencies in order to increase the distance between the ions .      in optical frequency standards based on single hydrogen - like trapped ions ,",
    "the transition frequency from the @xmath45 ground state to a metastable @xmath46 state is sensitive to electric field gradients .",
    "the @xmath46 state s atomic electric quadrupole moment interacting with residual electric quadrupole fields@xcite gives rise to frequency shifts of a few hertz .",
    "the shift of the zeeman sublevel @xmath47 in a quadrupole field @xmath48 with rotational symmetry is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the electric field gradient along the potential s symmetry axis @xmath51 , @xmath52 denotes the angle between the potential s symmetry axis @xmath53 and the magnetic field vector @xmath54 , and @xmath55 expresses the strength of the quadrupole moment in terms of a reduced matrix element@xcite .",
    "quadrupole moments have been calculated @xcite and experimentally determined @xcite for @xmath56sr@xmath2 , @xmath57hg@xmath2 and @xmath58yb@xmath2 by measuring the change in transition frequency from the electronic ground state to the metastable state that is affected by a static electric field gradient . in principle , the shift could also be detected by measuring transition frequencies between different zeeman sublevels .",
    "however , both measurement strategies become impracticable in the presence of non - vanishing first - order zeeman shifts since residual fluctuating magnetic fields prevent the use of sufficiently long laser - atom interaction times . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we demonstrated that this problem can be overcome by preparing a pair of ions in an entangled state that is decoherence free with respect to fluctuations of the magnetic field but sensitive to the quadrupole shift .",
    "[ fig2:levelshifts ] shows the energy - level shifts of the @xmath3 zeeman sublevels under the influence of a magnetic field and an electric quadrupole field . labeling the zeeman states",
    "@xmath59 by their magnetic quantum numbers , it can be seen that the bell state @xmath60 is a superposition of two constituents having energies that shift by the same amount in a magnetic field but shift in opposite directions if an electric field gradient is applied .",
    "we used this type of bell state for a precise determination of the @xmath3 state s quadrupole moment in @xmath1ca@xmath2 @xcite .    to test whether the method outlined in subsection [ sec2:unentangled ] could be applied to a measurement of the quadrupole moment , we prepared the state @xmath61 and let the fluctuating magnetic stray fields turn the pure state into a mixed state within a few milliseconds .",
    "after a waiting time ranging from 0.1 to 200 ms , @xmath13 pulses were applied and a parity measurement performed .",
    "[ fig3:parityoscillation ] shows the resulting parity oscillations whose contrast decays over a time interval orders of magnitude longer than any single - atom coherence time in @xmath1ca@xmath2 .",
    "a sinusoidal fit to the data reveals an initial contrast of 48(6)% and an oscillation frequency @xmath62  hz . for the fit , the first data point at t=0.1@xmath36s",
    "is not taken into account . at this time",
    ", the quantum state can not yet be described by a mixture similar to the one of eq .",
    "( [ mixture ] ) as some of the coherences persist for a few milliseconds and thus affect the parity signal .",
    "the parity signal decays exponentially with a time constant @xmath63  ms that is consistent with the assumption of spontaneous decay being the only source of decoherence ( in this case , one would have @xmath64  ms , where @xmath65 is the lifetime of the metastable state ) .",
    "the quadrupole moment is determined by measuring the quadrupole shift as a function of the electric field gradient @xmath66 .",
    "the latter is conveniently varied by changing the voltage applied to the axial trap electrodes . for a calibration of the gradient",
    ", the axial oscillation frequency of the ions is measured .",
    "further details regarding the measurement procedure are provided in ref .",
    "[ fig4:quadrupoleshift](a ) shows the quadrupole shift @xmath67 as a function of the field gradient ( the small offset at @xmath68 is caused by the second - order zeeman effect ) . by fitting a straight line to the data , the quadrupole moment",
    "can be calculated provided that the angle between the orientation of the electric field gradient and the quantization axis is known .",
    "setting @xmath69 , the fit yields the proportionality constant @xmath70 hz/(v / mm@xmath71 ) . for the same configuration ,",
    "the quadrupole shift was also measured with an entangled state , giving @xmath72 hz/(v / mm@xmath71 ) and thus confirming that the measurements with product and with entangled states give the same result .",
    "[ fig4:quadrupoleshift](b ) shows the deviations of the data points measured with entangled and with classically correlated ions with respect to the fit obtained from the entangled state data .",
    "as expected , the error bars of the measurement with classically correlated ions are bigger since the ramsey contrast is reduced and the quantum projection noise is higher .",
    "a rough estimation of the influence of quantum projection noise on the uncertainty @xmath73 of the quadrupole shift @xmath67 is obtained by setting @xmath74 , where @xmath21 is the maximum delay between state preparation and parity measurement , @xmath75 the resulting ramsey contrast , and @xmath76 denotes the number of experiments ( for two ions , @xmath77 state measurements contribute to the signal ) . for the experiments with entangled states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4:quadrupoleshift]b , where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80  ms , one expects @xmath81  mhz . for the product state experiments ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84  ms ) ,",
    "one expects @xmath85  mhz .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the experimental observations . even though experiments with product states suffer from a reduced ramsey contrast , they are attractive because these experiments are considerably easier to realize .",
    "contrary to the ones based on entangled states , they do not require cooling the ions to the ground state of the trapping potential by sideband cooling on the quadrupole transition using a laser with a narrow line width .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the precision of the quadrupole moment measurement is not limited by the statistical errors but rather by a number of systematic errors , the most important one being the alignment of the magnetic field vector defining the quantization axis with the symmetry axis of the trap @xcite described by the angle @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ shiftformula ] ) .",
    "as can be seen from ( [ shiftformula ] ) , any misalignment will reduce the quadrupole shift and thus result in an underestimation of the quadrupole moment . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the precision of the measurement was limited by the estimated uncertainty of @xmath86 .",
    "the linewidth of a narrow - band laser is often investigated by setting up two identical laser systems and observing their beat signal .",
    "if no second laser system is available , ramsey experiments are a suitable tool for determining the laser line width @xcite .",
    "this , however , requires the atomic transition line width not to be broadened by phase noise to an extent comparable to the laser line width to be measured . in @xmath1ca@xmath2 , this requirement is difficult to fulfil for lasers with a line width of 100 hz or below as all transitions depend on the magnetic field in first order . here again , a solution consists in performing ramsey measurements with a pair of ions in a correlated product state . for a measurement of the line width of the ti : sapphire laser exciting the @xmath1ca@xmath2 ions on the @xmath39 transition , we prepared the state @xmath87 where @xmath88 denote the states of ion 1 and ion 2 .",
    "the fringes of the single - ion ramsey signals @xmath89 , @xmath90 , show the same dependence on changes of the laser frequency but shift in opposite directions under changes of the magnetic field . here , @xmath91 is the phase shift arising from deviations of the laser frequency from the atomic transition frequency , @xmath92 denotes shifts due to deviations of the magnetic field from its mean value , and @xmath93 is the phase difference between the first and the second ramsey pulses .",
    "then , the two - ion parity signal is given by @xmath94 in the parity signal , the phase noise contributions from the laser and the magnetic field separate .",
    "moreover , it is even possible to make either the first or the second term vanish by the following procedure : for an estimation of the expectation value of the observable @xmath18 , a ramsey experiment is carried out @xmath76 times . if the phases @xmath95 are chosen to be random variables by setting @xmath96 , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a random variable with uniform distribution over the interval @xmath99 , the magnetic - field - dependent term averages to zero and ( [ paritylaser ] ) becomes @xmath100 as only the sum @xmath101 is not a random number . by setting @xmath96 , @xmath102 ,",
    "the experiment could also be made sensitive to decoherence caused by magnetic field noise and insensitive to laser frequency noise . in both cases ,",
    "all single - ion coherences are completely averaged out . by scanning the phase @xmath103 ,",
    "ramsey fringes are recorded for the parity @xmath18 and the resulting ramsey contrast can be plotted as a function of the ramsey time .",
    "note that the ramsey contrast will decay twice as fast as in a standard ramsey experiment with a single atom because of the factor @xmath104 in eq.([paritylaser ] ) .",
    "ramsey fringes recorded by this technique are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6:twoionphasescan ] . the figure s upper panel displays the two - ion parity signal as a function of @xmath103 for a ramsey time @xmath105  ms .",
    "the lower panel shows the single - ion signals @xmath106 , @xmath107 , having no contrast at all . in fig .",
    "[ fig7:ramseycontrastwithproductstates ] , the two - ion ramsey contrast is plotted as a function of the ramsey time @xmath21 .",
    "as low - frequency laser noise is the dominant source of noise broadening the laser line width in our experiments , the ramsey contrast data are fitted by a gaussian function with a half - width @xmath108  ms . from this value , we infer a laser line width of 48(2 )  hz on a time scale of one minute .",
    "in ion - trap experiments , one is often confronted with collective decoherence mechanisms caused by external fluctuating fields with spatial correlation lengths much longer than the typical distance between ions . in these conditions ,",
    "experiments with correlated ions prepared in decoherence - free subspaces allow for substantially longer coherence times than experiments investigating single - ion coherences only .",
    "while the preparation of entangled states is optimum for achieving high signal - to - noise ratios , substantial improvements can already be achieved by experimenting with ions that are classically correlated but not entangled .",
