    "one of the most important aim in the experiments of relativistic heavy - ion collisions is that of the study of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . the electromagnetic radiation is considered to be a useful probe for the investigation of the evolution of the qgp due to their very long mean free path in the medium @xcite .    in relativistic heavy - ion collisions dileptons",
