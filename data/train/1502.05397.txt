    "anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime is among the most popular geometries in quantum field theory on curved backgrounds .",
    "this interest is motivated by several reasons .",
    "first of all , because of its high symmetry , many problems are exactly solvable on ads bulk and this may shed light on the influence of a classical gravitational field on the quantum matter in more general geometries .",
    "the importance of ads spacetime as a gravitational background increased by its natural appearance as a stable ground state solution in extended supergravity and in string theories .",
    "the ads geometry plays a crucial role in two exciting developments in theoretical physics of the last 20 years such as the ads / cft correspondence and the braneworld scenario .",
    "the first one , the ads / cft correspondence @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) , represents a realization of the holographic principle and relates string theories or supergravity in the ads bulk with a conformal field theory living on its boundary .",
    "it enables to study conformal field theory and non - perturbative quantum gravity at the same time .",
    "the braneworld scenario ( for reviews on braneworld gravity see @xcite ) offers a new perspective on the hierarchy problem between the gravitational and electroweak mass scales . in the corresponding models ,",
    "our world is represented by a sub - manifold , a three - brane , embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime and the small coupling of four - dimensional gravity is generated by the large physical volume of extra dimensions .",
    "the investigations of quantum effects both in ads / cft and braneworld setups are of considerable interest in particle physics and in cosmology",
    ". an inherent feature in these setups is the presence of boundaries and the fields which propagate in the bulk will give casimir - type contributions to the vacuum expectation values of physical observables ( for reviews of the casimir effect see @xcite ) . in particular , in braneworld scenario , vacuum forces arise acting on the branes which , depending on the type of a field and boundary conditions imposed , can either stabilize or destabilize the braneworld .",
    "the casimir energy gives a contribution to both the brane and bulk cosmological constants and , hence , has to be taken into account in the self - consistent formulation of the corresponding models .",
    "motivated by these issues , the quantum vacuum effects induced by branes in ads bulk have received a great deal of attention .",
    "the casimir energy and the forces for parallel branes are investigated both for scalar and fermionic fields fabi00 .",
    "local casimir densities are discussed in @xcite .",
    "quantum vacuum effects in higher - dimensional generalizations of the ads spacetime with compact internal spaces have been studied in @xcite . the vacuum polarization induced by a cosmic string in ads spacetime",
    "is investigated in @xcite for both scalar and fermionic fields .    in the most of the papers cited above the branes",
    "are considered to be parallel to the ads boundary .",
    "recently , there have been some attempts to extend ads / cft correspondence to the case with boundaries in cft side taka11 . in an effective description of the corresponding holographic dual ( ads / bcft correspondence ) a boundary is introduced in ads bulk which crosses the ads boundary and is anchored at the boundary of cft . in the construction of @xcite , on the boundary in ads bulk , the neumann boundary condition is imposed in the gravity sector .",
    "another class of problems with boundaries in the bulk crossing the ads boundary , recently appeared related to a geometric procedure for the evaluation of the entanglement entropy in the context of the ads / cft correspondence suggested in @xcite ( for an overview see @xcite ) . in accordance with this procedure",
    ", the entanglement entropy for a bounded region in cft with respect to its spatial complement is expressed in terms of the area of the minimal surface in the bulk , anchored at the boundary of that region . in quantum field theory",
    ", the boundaries in both ads and cft will lead to the shifts in the expectation values of physical quantities describing the properties of the vacuum .",
    "these effects should be taken into account in discussions of the stability of the corresponding models .    in the present paper , for a scalar quantum field with general curvature coupling parameter",
    ", we consider an exactly solvable problem with a flat brane in ads spacetime perpendicular to its boundary .",
    "this model is a holographic dual of bcft defined on a half - space . in order to clarify the role of the boundary condition",
    ", we impose on the field operator a general robin condition .",
    "our main interest will be the changes in the properties of the quantum vacuum induced by the presence of the brane .",
    "the important quantities that characterize the local properties of the vacuum are the expectation values of the field squared and energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the latter serves as a source in the right - hand side of semiclassical einstein equations and plays an important role in considerations of the back - reaction from quantum effects .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we evaluate the positive - frequency wightman function and the bulk - to - boundary propagator .",
    "the corresponding expressions are explicitly decomposed into the boundary - free and brane - induced contributions .",
    "on the base of this , in sections [ sec : phi2 ] and sec : emt we investigate the mean field squared and the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "various asymptotics for the brane - induced contributions are discussed and the corresponding results are compared with those for a robin plate in minkowski spacetime .",
    "section sec : conc summarizes the main results of the paper .",
    "let us consider a scalar field @xmath0 on background of a @xmath1-dimensional ads spacetime with the curvature radius @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding line element will be taken in the form @xmath3where @xmath4 is the metric tensor for the @xmath5-dimensional minkowski spacetime , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . for a field with the curvature coupling parameter @xmath8",
    "the field equation has the form @xmath9where @xmath10 is the covariant derivative operator and @xmath11 is the ricci scalar .",
    "the latter is related to the curvature radius as @xmath12 . for special cases of minimally and conformally coupled scalars",

    "our main interest in this paper are the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the field squared and of the energy - momentum tensor in the presence of a flat brane at @xmath22 . in what follows , for definiteness , we shall consider the region @xmath23 .",

    "we impose the robin boundary condition @xmath26with a constant coefficient @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding results for dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are obtained as special cases corresponding to @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the geometry under consideration presents a holographic description of a bcft living on the hypersurface @xmath20 , @xmath23 .",
    "the robin boundary condition naturally arises for scalar bulk fields in braneworld models .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 encodes the properties of the brane .",
    "for example , in the randall - sundrum braneworld models with the branes parallel to the ads boundary , this coefficient is expressed in terms of the curvature coupling parameter and brane mass terms for a scalar field @xcite .",
    "the imposition of the boundary condition modifies the spectrum for the vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields . as a consequence ,",
    "the vevs of physical quantities are shifted with respect to the vevs in the boundary - free geometry .",
    "the renormalized vevs of bilinear combinations of the field operator are obtained from the two - point functions after an appropriate renormalization procedure . in this section",
    ", we shall evaluate the positive - frequency wightman function , @xmath31where @xmath32 stands for the vacuum state .",
    "this function also determines the response of unruh - dewitt - type particle detectors interacting locally with a quantum field under consideration ( see , for instance , birr82 ) . for the evaluation of the wightman function we shall employ the direct summation approach over a complete orthonormal set of mode functions @xmath33 , specified by a set of quantum numbers @xmath34 and obeying the boundary condition ( [ boundcond ] ) .",

    "<S> we investigate the wightman function , the bulk - to - boundary propagator , the mean field squared and the vacuum expectation values of energy - momentum tensor for a scalar field in ads spacetime , in the presence of a brane perpendicular to the ads boundary . on the brane the field operator obeys robin boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum expectation values are decomposed into the boundary - free ads and brane - induced contributions . in this way , for points away from the brane </S>",
    "<S> , the renormalization is reduced to the one in pure ads spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that at proper distances from the brane larger than the ads curvature radius the brane - induced expectation values decay as power - law for both massless and massive scalars . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is in contrast to that for a plane boundary in minkowski spacetime , with an exponential decay for massive fields . for robin boundary conditions different from dirichlet and neumann ones , </S>",
    "<S> the brane - induced part in the energy density is positive near the brane and negative at large distances . for dirichlet / neumann boundary condition </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding energy density is negative / positive everywhere . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , for a fixed value of the proper distance from the brane , near the ads boundary , the neumann boundary condition is an `` attractor '' in the general class of robin boundary conditions , whereas dirichlet boundary condition is an `` attractor '' near the horizon .    </S>",
