    "exotic vortex states @xcite , non trivial interactions between the vortices @xcite , and hidden criticality @xcite are also peculiar phenomena associated with the multi - gap and multi - condensate nature of the superconducting state . in these systems , the total superconducting condensate results from the coherent mixture of partial condensates forming in each band , and the partial condensates can have very different properties , leading to interesting interference effects .",
    "very recently , evidences of the bcs - bec crossover and strong coupling superconductivity have been reported in the small fermi surface pockets of multi - band supeconductors .",
    "arpes measurements in iron - calchogenide superconductors have shown a superconducting gap to fermi energy ratio of order unity in the shallow upper bands .",
    "the crossover regime has been detected by the collapse of the small fermi surface pocket and by the electronic band dispersion becoming an inverted parabola in the coherent state @xcite .",
    "this phenomenology observed in iron - based superconductors is the same as the one predicted and observed in ultracold fermions @xcite .",
    "moreover , in underdoped superconducting cuprates the bandwidth around the m points of the brillouin zone is very narrow , of the same order of the gap and pseudogap .",
    "evidences of broken fermi surface and multi - band effects are also recently reported in ybco superconducting cuprates due to charge ordering @xcite .",
    "a sizable pseudogap , its continuos evolution across t@xmath1 , together with a short correlation length are evidences for strong pairing effects @xcite and importance of the bcs - bec crossover in the underdoped cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "another motivation to study the bcs - bec crossover in two - band superconductors comes from the superconducting properties of the iron - based superconductor ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 ( t@xmath1=37k ) .",
    "two different s - wave gaps open in the different sheets of fermi surface ( fs ) : a large gap of @xmath5=12 mev on the small fs and a small gap @xmath6=6 mev in the large fs @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath7=3.7 is very close to the bcs value of 3.5 , indicating bcs - like weakly coupled pairs in the large fs , while @xmath8=7.5 is very large and typical of bec - like strongly coupled pairs in the small fs .",
    "hence , the total superconducting condensate in bakfeas is a coherent mixture of bcs - like and bec - like partial condensates .",
    "a two - gap superconductor with quite distinct gaps in the different bands is also mgb@xmath9 . in this material",
    "evidences for resonant and crossover phenomena due to proximity to a band edge have been reported @xcite .    quantum confinement and shape resonance in stripe systems , proposed as a mechanism for t@xmath1 amplifications @xcite with recent experimental confirmation in metallic stripes @xcite ,",
    "are clearly in coexistence with bcs - bec crossover , which can determine the best situation for high - t@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "indeed , multi - band bcs - bec crossover can determine the optimal condition to allow the screening of superconduciting fluctuations .",
    "this screening effect is expected to be active in a two - band superconductor , as shown by means of a ginzburg - landau approach in ref.@xcite .    quite generally ,",
    "different families of iron - based superconductors show new small fermi surfaces at optimum doping where t@xmath10 is the highest , appearing when the chemical potential is near a band edge , close to the bottom ( if electron like ) or top ( if hole like ) of the energy bands @xcite .",
    "in this situation , experiments show no evidences for nesting topology and the mechanism for high - t@xmath0 can be associated with the shape resonance scenario @xcite . in fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) of ref.@xcite the fermi surfaces topology for different superconducting iron - based materials have been schematized , showing that in all cases large fermi surfaces coexist with small fermi surface pockets , supporting the ( at least ) two - band model for superconductivity as the minimal model to capture the band - edge physics and corresponding novel multi - band bcs - bec crossover phenomena .    in 2d electron gases numerical evidences based on bogoliubov - de gennes equations for the bcs - bec crossover in surface superconductivity have been found .",
    "in such systems the crossover phenomenon can be explored by controlling the gate voltage of the surface superconductivity .",
    "a gap to fermi energy ratio larger than one signals the realization of the bec regime in one of the bands of srtio@xmath11 , whereas the other bands are in the bcs regime having a gap to fermi energy ratio smaller than one @xcite .",
    "finally , in ultracold cigar - shaped fermi gases the quantum confinement induces the formation of a series of single - particle subbands .",
    "as theoretically predicted in ref.@xcite , in the superfluid state of these systems the total condensate is a coherent mixture of subband condensates , each of which undergoes a bcs - bec crossover when the edge of the corresponding subband approaches the chemical potential .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover in two - band ultracold fermions in the superfluid state has been studied at mean - field and ginzburg - landau level in ref.@xcite .",
    "main results of ref.@xcite have been the understanding of the role of the interband ( josephson - like ) coupling in driving the transition between a 0-phase and a @xmath12-phase of the two component order parameter , the undamped collective excitations and the finite temperature ginzburg - landau description of the two - band bcs - bec crossover .",
    "+ in this work we will focus on the bcs - bec crossover which can be induced in one of the partial condensates when the chemical potential is close to the band edge of a two - band system . in our model system ,",
    "one partial condensate is in the weak - coupling regime with extedend cooper pairs forming in the large fermi surface , while the second partial condensate has tunable properties , and the pairing in the small fermi surface can be varied from the weak- to the strong - coupling regime , allowing for the bcs - bec crossover to be induced in the band associated with the small fermi surface .",
    "we will explore at mean - field level and at zero temperature , in a three dimensional continuum , the phase space of the interaction parameters in order to detect the boundaries between the different bcs , crossover , and bec regimes , locating in the boundary diagrams the available experimental data of multi - gap superconductors .",
    "+ the physical description of the zero temperature bcs - bec crossover @xcite is based on two physical quantities : the condensate fraction @xcite and the average size of the cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "the condensate fraction quantifies the fraction of fermions participating in the condensation into the superconducting state : in the bcs regime the condensate fraction is exponentially small and a very small density of fermions forms the condensate wave - function ; in the bec regime the condensate fraction approaches unity , being the attraction so strong that all the fermions form local molecular pairs with bosonic character . in terms of the average pair size",
    "@xmath13 the physics is well known , being the parameter @xmath14 the first parameter used in the pioneering work on the bcs - bec crossover @xcite .",
    "the bcs regime is characterized by @xmath15 , while in the bec regime point - like pairs lead to @xmath16 .",
    "this characterization of the bcs - bec crossover results to be very clear from a theoretical and phenomenological point of view , but unfortunately both the condensate fraction and the average size of the pairs are not easy to be measured .",
    "hence , in this work we provide a way to link the bcs - bec crossover given in terms of the condensate fraction @xmath17 and @xmath14 to the ratio between the superconducting pairing gap at @xmath18 to the fermi energy of the non interacting system .",
    "this ratio is measurable in experiments by arpes , tunnelling ( stm ) or specific heat measurements and can then provide a very useful parameter to detect the bcs - bec crossover in complex multi - gap superconductors , as the case of iron - pnictides , mgb@xmath9 or cuprates .",

    "the @xmath133 data points are reported in fig.8 with two arrows to indicate that the characteristic energy scale of the pairing interaction is not known , but it is of the order or larger than the ( local ) fermi energy of the upper band , having the pairing an electronic origin .",
    "+ therefore , the central result of our work is that : ( @xmath25 ) the superconducting iron chalcogenides are in the middle of the crossover regime of the bcs - bec crossover , while ( @xmath142 ) co - doped iron - pnictides superconductors are close to the bec regime , with the bec character being more pronounced for increasing co - doping .",
    "our conclusion is that the two - band system with moderate intraband coupling for @xmath143 is in the crossover regime of the bcs - bec crossover for any choice of pairing @xmath116 and cutoff frequency @xmath117 considered in this paper . as a consequence",
    "the crossover region of the two - band system is wider than that of the one - band system . on the other hand , only extreme values of @xmath1444 and very large values of @xmath117 ( plausible for pairing glue having an electronic origin ) will drive the system toward the bec regime for the partial condensate in the upper band .",
    "+ we now pass to discuss our results on the average size of the cooper pairs in the two bands ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) .",
    "the ratio between the two gaps @xmath147 will be also reported being a quantity directly comparable with experiments .",
    "we consider here two cases in the crossover regime in fig.8 : + ( @xmath25 ) for @xmath133=1 and @xmath117=2.5 we obtain @xmath145=8.4 and @xmath146=1.2 with a ratio @xmath147=4 .",
    "in this situation we have extended overlapping cooper pairs in band 1 and molecular - like bosonic pairs in band 2 .",
    "the total condensate is a coherent mixture of cooper pairs and ( almost ) point - like molecular pairs .",
    "+ ( @xmath142 ) for @xmath133=0.5 , same @xmath117=2.5 , the results are less extreme .",
    "we obtain @xmath145=10.6 and @xmath146=2.2 , with a ratio @xmath147=2.5 .",
    "the cooper pairs in band 2 start to overlap and the corresponding partial condensate is in the middle of the crossover regime between bcs and bec ( indeed in fig.8 the experimental point @xmath133=0.5 is very close to the line @xmath17=0.5 indicating the center of the crossover regime ) .",
    "this second case is very close to the experimental findings for the superconductor ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath9as@xmath9 as reported in ref.@xcite ( @xmath6=6 mev , @xmath5=12 mev ) .",
    "we finally conclude with an observation concerning the results that we obtain increasing the bottom band energy of the upper band .",
    "for @xmath148=0.7 ( and same choice of @xmath118=0.15 , @xmath78=0.05 , 0.15 and 0.25 ) the bcs boundary line and the center of the crossover line for the partial condensate in the upper band ( @xmath114=0.2 and 0.5 respectively ) are almost not affected by the different choice of @xmath148 , being also the corresponding values of the gap not much affected . on the other hand the boundary line @xmath115=0 is placed to larger values of the coupling @xmath116 and of the cutoff frequency @xmath117 , and the corresponding gap @xmath1497 is also larger than in the case @xmath148=0.5 .",
    "one possible reason for this ( unexpected ) result is that the increased separation @xmath33 between the bands leads to a larger density in band 1 , determining a slower variation of the chemical potential @xmath23 for increasing coupling .",
    "we have analyzed the ground state superconducting properties of one- and two - band systems of fermions interacting through a separable attractive potential with an energy cutoff .",
    "+ for the one - band system we have analyzed the behaviour of the superconducting gap , condensate fraction and pair correlation length as a function of coupling for different values of the cutoff .",
    "we have found that our model system gives expected results both in the weak- and in the strong - coupling limits .",
    "the pair correlation length and the superconducting gap recover the bcs limit for weak interactions , and the chemical potential approaches half of the binding energy of a bound state of two fermions in the bec limit . by choosing three values for the condensate fraction",
    "we have defined the boundaries of the bcs , crossover and bec regime of the bcs - bec crossover , and we have determined the corresponding boundary values for the superconducting gap and for the pair correlation length .",
    "the superconducting gap to fermi energy ratio is the most accessible physical quantity that can be measured in experiments .",
    "we have found that when the ratio between the gap and the fermi energy is in the range @xmath113 the system is in the crossover regime of the bcs - bec crossover for every value of the coupling and of the energy cutoff .",
    "therefore this connection between @xmath110 and the crossover regime is not associated with the particular microscopic structure of the pairing interaction .",
    "the ratio @xmath110 results to be a useful detection parameter to characterize the regime of pairing of a superconductor , locating it in the bcs - bec crossover . + for the two - band system we have analyzed the crossover boundary diagrams for the partial condensate fraction in the upper band and for the change of sign of the chemical potential relative to the bottom of the upper band .",
    "different values of the interband coupling have been considered , assuming a weak - coupling regime of pairing in the lower band .",
    "we found that for increasing values of the interband coupling the access to the crossover regime is progressively anticipated with respect to the one - band case .",
    "the bec regime for the partial condensate fraction is not reached in our range of coupling and energy cutoff , because the presence of the lower band locks the chemical potential , retarding the change of sign of the chemical potential relative to the bottom of the upper band , and preventing the two - band system from accessing the bec regime , widening in this way the crossover regime of the bcs - bec crossover . + in conclusion , our work gives a simple and quite general theoretical support to the recent arpes measurements in iron - based superconductors which provide evidences that the cooper pairs in the small fermi surface form a condensate which is at the border between the crossover and the bec regime .",
    "therefore , the bcs - bec crossover seems to be clearly realized in this new class of high - t@xmath1 superconductors .",
