    "the combination of the spectrum scarcity and congestion has motivated researchers to propose more innovative techniques to tackle these challenges .",
    "fixed spectrum allocation techniques assign certain bands to certain applications , which may no longer efficiently used @xcite .",
    "solving the problem would require changing the regulations which is a complicated and lengthy procedure . with that in mind",
    ", the paradigm of cognitive radios has been proposed as a promising agile technology that can revolutionize the future of telecommunication by  breaking the gridlock of the wireless spectrum \" @xcite .",
    "the key idea of their implementation is to allow opportunistic transmissions to share the wireless medium .",
    "thus , two initial hierarchical levels have been defined : primary level and cognitive level ( the users within each level are called primary users ( pu ) and cognitive users ( cu ) respectively ) .",
    "the interaction between these two levels is determined by the agility of the cognitive level and the predefined constraints imposed by the primary level @xcite .",
    "overlay , underlay and interweave are three general implementations which regulate the coexistence terms of both systems .",
    "the first two implementations allow simultaneous transmissions , which leads to better spectrum utilization in comparison to the last one , which allocates the spectrum to the cognitive system by detecting the absence of the primary one @xcite .",
    "the form of integration in this work is defined by cooperation between the two levels in the cognitive interference channel .",
    "the cooperation can aid the primary network to satisfy the quality of service ( qos ) or enhance the rate of its own users by backhauling its data through the cognitive system@xcite-@xcite ; cbss can operate as relays for primary messages and as regular base stations to serve their cognitive users .",
    "the cognitive system benefits by providing a service to its users .",
    "this kind of cognitive implementation fits with practical overlay cognitive definition , as the pu is being served from both the ps and the cbss by performing relaying between them to make primary data accessible by the cbs .",
    "sometimes the primary symbols are not available to the cognitive system , as a result the cognitive system needs to take the sufficient precautions to protect the primary system from the interference created by its own transmissions .",
    "it should be noted that we assume that the cbss are equipped with multiple antennas to handle multi - user transmissions , and to enable interference mitigation",
    ".    the conventional look at interference can be shifted from a degradation factor into a favorable one if we handle the transmitted data frame at symbol level . at this level",
    ", the interference can be classified into : constructive and destructive ones .",
    "this classification is initially proposed in @xcite ; instead of fully inverting the channel to grant zero interference among the spatial streams , the proposed precoding suggests keeping the constructive interference while removing the destructive part by partial channel inversion .",
    "this technique is proven to outperform the traditional zero forcing precoding .",
    "a more advanced technique is proposed in @xcite , where an interference rotation is examined to make the interference constructive for all users . moreover , a modified maximum ratio transmissions technique that performs unitary rotations to create constructive interference among the interfering multiuser streams is proposed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a connection between symbol based constructive interference precoding and phy multicast is established in @xcite-@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we utilize the symbol level precoding in underlay miso cognitive radio scenarios .",
    "we shape the interference between the cognitive users to provide constructive characteristics without violating the interference temperature constraints on the primary receivers .",
    "[ cols=\"^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the theoretical upper - bound can be formulated by dropping the phase constraint @xmath0 of ( [ pow ] ) .",
    "the optimal input covariance @xmath1 can be found by solving the following optimization problem :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 .",
    "this problem resembles the multicast problem @xcite with additional interference temperature constraint to suit the constraint imposed by the primary system .",
    "in order to assess the performance of the proposed transmissions schemes , monte - carlo simulations of the different algorithms have been conducted to study the performance of the proposed techniques and compare to the state of the art techniques .",
    "the adopted channel model is assumed to be as the following    * @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is vector of all ones and of size @xmath6 .",
    "* @xmath7 * @xmath8 * @xmath9 * to study the performance of the system at the worst case scenario , when all users have a strong channel with respect to its direct and interfering base stations @xmath10 .    in the figures , we denote the proposed cognitive technique that exploits the constructive interference by ( ccipm ) , while s denotes the strict interference constraints @xmath11 .",
    "cbs has 3 antennas and serves 2 cognitive users .",
    "we compare the performance of the proposed scheme ( ccipm ) to the scheme in @xcite tailored to cognitive scenario by solving the following optimization @xmath12 where @xmath13 is defined in @xcite .",
    "we utilize the energy efficiency metric to assess the performance of the proposed technique as @xmath14 @xmath15 denotes the rate of the @xmath16 user . in all figures ,",
    "we depict the performance of constructive interference zero forcing ( ccizf ) . for the sake of comparison",
    ", the transmit power of the ccizf solutions can be scaled until all users achieve the target rate .    in fig.[fig1 ] , the energy efficiency with respect to the average channel is depicted , the used modulation is qpsk and the strict interference constraint imposed by the primary system .",
    "we compare the performance of the ccipm to the theoretical upper - bound and ccizf .",
    "it can be noted that the ccizf curve saturates at the low - mid snr regime , while the curves of ccipm and multicast have higher growth in terms of energy efficiency in the same regime .",
    "moreover , it can be noted that ccipm outperforms ccizf at different channel strength values .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we depict the energy efficiency at different target rates . for the constructive interference schemes , we assign the target rate with its corresponding mpsk modulation .",
    "it can be noted that the theoretical upper bounds for the scenario of the strict and the relaxed interference constraints have the same power consumption at target rate equals to 1 bps@xmath17hz .",
    "however , this result does not hold for constructive interference technique .",
    "moreover , it can be noted that the gap between the theoretical bound and the ccipm is fixed at the both scenario for all target rates .    _",

    "in this paper , we propose symbol - level precoding techniques for the downlink of cognitive underlay system .",
    "these techniques exploits the availability of the csi and the data symbols to constructively correlate the transmission for the cognitive users without violating the interference temperature at the primary users .",
    "this enables interference exploitation among the cognitive multiuser transmissions assuming m - psk modulation .",
    "the designed precoder aims at minimizing the transmitted power at cbs while granting a certain received snr at each cognitive users . from the numerical results section",
    ", it can be concluded that the cbs consumes less power at the relaxed interference constraints .",
