    "coulomb drag propulsion means putting a long , thin and charged tether into a natural plasma flow and tapping momentum from the flow by coulombic deflection of the flow ions by the electric field that surrounds the tether .",
    "coulomb drag propulsion was first proposed @xcite for interplanetary propulsion by the electric solar wind sail ( electric sail , e - sail ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : esail3d ] .",
    "the e - sail has potentially revolutionary performance level in comparison to other propulsion systems @xcite .",
    "the tether weighs only 10 grams per kilometre and produces a thrust of @xmath0 mn / km at 1 au distance .",
    "the e - sail thrust scales as proportional to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the solar distance .",
    "the reason is that while the solar wind dynamic pressure decays as @xmath3 , the plasma debye length ( by which the electric field penetration distance and hence the virtual sail size scales ) varies as @xmath4 , thus giving an overall @xmath1 dependence for the thrust .",
    "for example , hundred 20 km long tethers would weigh 20 kg and they would produce 1 n thrust at 1 au which gives a 30 km / s velocity change pear year for a 1000 kg spacecraft",
    ".    e - sail thrust magnitude can be easily controlled between zero and a maximum value by changing the voltage of the tethers .",
    "the tether voltage is maintained by continuously operating an electron gun which pumps out negative charge from the system , hence tether voltage can be actuated easily by changing the current and voltage of the electron gun beam .",
    "the power consumption of the electron gun is moderate ( 700 w nominally at 1 au for large 1 n sail ) and it scales as @xmath5 , i.e.  in the same way as the illumination power of solar panels .",
    "the power consumption stems from the electron current gathered from the surrounding solar wind plasma by the positively charged tethers which can be estimated by so - called orbital motion limited ( oml ) cylindrical langmuir probe theory @xcite , @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the electron charge , @xmath8 is the solar wind plasma density , @xmath9 is the tether bias voltage , @xmath10 is electron mass , @xmath11 m is the base wire radius of the micrometeoroid - resistant tether , which is assumed to have four wires in eq .",
    "( [ eq : didz ] ) with parallel wire radius @xmath12 m and loop wire radius @xmath13 m .",
    "later it was found @xcite that coulomb drag propulsion can also be used for satellite deorbiting in low earth orbit ( leo ) .",
    "contrary to the solar wind , in leo it seems more attractive to use negative tether polarity because it needs less power than a positive polarity one and because the balancing ion emitter can in leo conditions often be implemented simply by the satellite s conducting surface .",
    "the leo application is called the plasma brake ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plasmabrake ] ) . according to simulations ,",
    "a 5 km long negatively charged plasma brake tether weighing 0.055 kg could produce 0.43 mn braking force which is enough to reduce the orbital altitude of a 260 kg object by 100 km per year @xcite .",
    "part of the material in this paper is taken from the space propulsion 2014 proceedings paper @xcite .",
    "when plasma streams past a charged thin tether , the tether s electric field penetrates some distance into the plasma and deflects the charged particles of the stream . because electrons are lightweight ,",
    "the momentum flux carried by them is negligible so it is enough to consider the deflection of ions . both positively and negatively biased tethers cause ion deflection and hence coulomb drag .",
    "a positive tether deflects positively charged ions by repelling them ( fig .",
    "[ fig : positivetether ] ) .",
    "a negative tether deflects ions by attracting them so that their paths cross behind the tether ( fig .  [",
    "fig : negativetether ] ) .",
    "a positively biased tether repels stream ions and attracts electrons .",
    "when the potential is turned on , a population of trapped electrons gets formed @xcite . in most of the literature concerning biased tethers ,",
    "it is implicitly or explicitly assumed that trapped electrons are not present in the asymptotic state . in a multi - tether starfish - shaped e - sail geometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : esail3d ] ) , trapped electron orbits are chaotised whenever the electron visits the central `` hub '' which is the spacecraft , and chaotised electrons have a small nonzero probability of getting injected into an orbit which takes them to collision course with a tether wire so that trapped electrons are removed by this mechanism in few minute timescale in nominal 1 au solar wind @xcite .",
    "it might be that other processes such as plasma waves occur in nature which speed up the process . by pic simulations",
    "alone it is not easy to predict how many trapped electrons are present in the final state , although the question was recently analysed also using a novel , indirect approach @xcite .    the e - sail thrust per tether length @xmath14",
    "is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a numerical coefficient of order unity , @xmath17 is the dynamic pressure of the plasma flow and @xmath18 is the radius of the electron sheath ( the penetration distance of the electric field into the plasma ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 can be inferred from recent laboratory measurements of siguier et al .",
    "@xcite where ar@xmath19 plasma ( ion mass @xmath20 u ) of density @xmath21 m@xmath22 accelerated to 20 ev bulk flow energy ( hence speed @xmath23 km / s ) was used and let to interact with @xmath24 mm radius metal tether biased to @xmath25 v and 400 v in two experiments . at @xmath25",
    "v the sheath radius as visually determined from their figure 7 is @xmath26 cm and at 400 v it is @xmath27 cm ( from their figure 8) . for estimating the corresponding @xmath14 , let us assume @xmath28 in the above formula [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfdz ] ) ] .",
    "this corresponds to assuming that ions incident on the sheath are on average deflected by 90@xmath29 ( notice that the size of the virtual obstacle made by the sheath is twice its radius ) .",
    "we think that this is a reasonable first estimate since ions arriving head - on towards the tether are reflected backwards while ions arriving near the boundaries of the sheath are probably deflected less than 90@xmath29 . in their experiment",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31pa so eq .  [ eq : dfdz ] gives @xmath32 nn / m and @xmath33 nn / m for @xmath9 equal to 100 v and 400 v , respectively .",
    "let us compare these experimentally inferred values with theoretical estimates .",
    "a simple theoretical estimate for the sheath radius is the effective debye length @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the stream ion bulk flow energy .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : lambdadeff ] ) for the effective debye length is obtained from the usual formula for ordinary electron debye length by replacing the electron temperature by the tether voltage .",
    "we also subtract the bulk energy term @xmath36 to model the fact that if the tether voltage is lower than the bulk energy , it can no longer reflect back or stop ions but only weakly deflects them even if they arrive with zero boost parameter ; the subtraction of @xmath36 however has only modest impact to our results . if one takes @xmath18 to be equal to @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfdz ] ) , one obtains @xmath14 equal to 420 nn / m and 910 nn / m for @xmath9 equal to 100 v and 400 v , respectively .    theoretical e - sail thrust formulas of @xcite contain the average electron density @xmath38 inside the sheath as a free parameter , the choice @xmath39 giving the largest e - sail thrust .",
    "assuming @xmath39 and applying the formulas for the experimental parameters of siguier et al .",
    "@xcite , one obtains 220 nn / m and 740 nn / m thrust per length for @xmath9 equal to 100 v and 400 v , respectively .",
    "we summarise the experimental and theoretical results in table [ tab : numeric - comparison ] .",
    ".comparison of experimental and theoretical e - sail thrust per length in leo - like conditions . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ tab : plasmabrakethrust ] gives plasma brake thrust based on eq .",
    "[ eq : dfdzneg ] , assuming @xmath40 kv , @xmath41 km / s and using plasma density and chemical composition taken from the iri-2012 ionospheric model @xcite , for noon - midnight ( mean local time mlt 12 - 00 ) and dawn - dusk ( mlt 06 - 18 ) polar orbits and for solar minimum and maximum ionospheric conditions .",
    "we see from table [ tab : plasmabrakethrust ] that the dependence on solar cycle is relatively significant , about factor 3.5 .",
    "the solar cycle dependence is due to increased plasma density and increased oxygen abundance during solar maximum conditions .",
    "there is obviously also an altitude dependence .",
    "below 700 km the thrust would continue to increase until @xmath42 km , provided that the hardware is designed to take advantage of it .",
    "the dependence on mlt is weak .    as a numerical example , consider a 10 km long plasma brake tether which starts bringing down a debris object of 200 kg mass from 800 km circular orbit in an mlt which is average between dawn - dusk and noon - midnight .",
    "the required @xmath43 from 800 km to 700 km is 53.5 m / s and from 700 km to 400 km 165 m / s . during solar minimum",
    ", deorbiting from 800 km to 700 km takes 0.88 years and the rest from 700 km to 400 km ( assuming the same thrust as at 700 km ) takes 2.4 years , thus altogether 3.25 years . during solar maximum the 800@xmath44700 km deorbiting takes 0.25 years and 700@xmath44400 km 0.7 years , thus altogether 0.96 years .",
    "these estimates are conservative since in reality plasma density and oxygen concentration and hence plasma brake thrust continue to grow below 700 km .",
    "based on plasma simulations and an indirect laboratory result , there is good reason to think that the magnitude of tether coulomb drag is in very useful range at least for ( 1 ) positive tether in solar wind ( e - sail ) and ( 2 ) negative tether in leo ( plasma brake ) .",
    "coulomb drag propulsion in both positive and negative mode will soon be attempted to be measured by aalto-1 satellite .",
    "aalto-1 is a 3-u cubesat to be launched in may 2016 in polar leo .",
    "ideally we will get a measurement of positive and negative mode coulomb drag as function of plasma density , tether length and voltage .",
    "the results can then be compared with earlier simulation predictions .",
    "we should also be able to observe measurable lowering of the satellite orbit using the negative mode at 100 m tether length . in the very best case ,",
    "if the satellite and the experiment stay alive long enough , we could even observe reentry into atmosphere .",
