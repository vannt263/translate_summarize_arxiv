    "over many years , the muon has provided important input to the standard model : the value of the weak coupling constant @xmath0 , strong proof of the @xmath1 nature of the weak interaction , information on the induced weak pseudoscalar form factor @xmath2 , strong contraints on new physics from its anomalous magnetic moment , and sensitive limits on the presence of new physics which would cause lepton flavor violation in the muon s decay .",
    "in addition to its contributions to particle physics , the muon has become a useful tool in condensed matter physics .",
    "we heard about all of these topics in our working group sessions , and the projections from these very nice talks are on the nufact website . in this summary",
    "we will focus on the `` muon trio '' : the anomalous magnetic dipole moment ( mdm)@xcite @xmath3 ; the search for a permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the muon@xcite which would signify @xmath4 , @xmath5 and by implication @xmath6-violation if @xmath7 is valid ; and the search for lepton flavor violation ( ) @xcite .",
    "we focus on these experiments , and specifically on the latter two because they require the highest possible muon flux , which would only be available at a high - intensity muon source such as a neutrino factory .",
    "useful reviews can be found for : muon physics at a neutrio factory@xcite ; theory of muon 2@xcite ; electric dipole moments@xcite ; and lepton flavor violation@xcite .",
    "the muon anomalous magnetic moment has now been measured by bnl e821 to a relative precision of 0.5 parts per million ( ppm),@xcite and it is proposed to improve this experiment to 0.2  ppm in an upgraded experiment e969 at brookhaven .",
    "e969 has scientific approval but is not yet funded@xcite .",
    "since the first precise result from e821 became available@xcite , there has been an approximate 2.5 standard deviation discrepancy between theory ( presently known to about 0.6 ppm ) and experiment , when the hadronic contribution is taken from @xmath8 data .",
    "there is much activity worldwide in improving our knowledge of the hadronic contribution@xcite .",
    "this increased precision available to e969 , combined with the expected improvements in the knowledge of the hadronic contribution , eventually should give at least a factor of two reduction in the combined experiment - theory uncertainty when comparing the two .",
    "it is possible to improve on the experiment further@xcite , but to fully realize the potential of the improved experimental measurement , the hadronic contribution would need to be known below 0.1 ppm uncertainty .",
    "one of the most important roles the measurements of @xmath9 have played in the past is placing serious restrictions on physics beyond the standard model@xcite . with the development of supersymmetric theories as a favored scheme of physics beyond",
    "the standard model , interest in the experimental and theoretical value of @xmath9 has grown substantially .",
    "susy contributions to @xmath9 could be at a measurable level in a broad range of models .",
    "it is interesting , although speculative , to note that there is a certain consistency of evidence supporting the proposal that the dark matter candidate is the lightest supersymmetric partner , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : dark]@xcite .",
    "the projected 2 precision of e969 plus the expected improved theory uncertainty would reduce the size of the @xmath10 band of allowed values down to the present @xmath11 band shown in fig .",

    "the tipping of the precession plane is very small , ( @xmath55 mrad ) if one uses the cern edm limit@xcite given in table [ tb : edm ] .",

    "the time and energy of each event is stored for analysis offline .",
    "muon decay is a three - body decay , so the 3.1 gev muons produce a continuum of positrons ( electrons ) from the end - point energy down . since the highest energy @xmath58 are correlated with the muon spin , if one counts high - energy @xmath58 as a function of time , one gets an exponential from muon decay modulated by the @xmath60 precession@xcite .",
    "we have recently introduced a new idea which optimizes the edm signal by operating a new dedicated storage ring off of the magic momentum , and uses a radial electric field to turn off the 2 precession .",
    "then the spin will follow the momentum as the muons go around the ring , except for any movement arising from an edm@xcite .",
    "the dedicated experiment will be operated well off of the magic @xmath54 , for example @xmath61 and @xmath62 mev / c .",
    "the edm would cause a steady build - up of the spin out of the plane with time .",
    "detectors would be placed above and below the storage region , and a time - dependent up - down asymmetry @xmath63 would be the signal of an edm , @xmath64    the figure of merit for statistics in the edm experiment is the number of muons times the polarization squared . in order to reach @xmath65 cm ,",

    "the `` next generation '' @xmath69 experiment , meg , is now under construction at psi@xcite , and data collection is to begin in 2006 . since the decay occurs at rest , the photon and positron are back - to - back , and share the energy of the muon mass .",

    "the  experiment which holds the most promise to go to higher muon rates , is the coherent conversion of a muon to an electron in the field of a nucleus , @xmath72 .",
    "the signal is a single electron with an energy equal to the muon mass , less the binding energy of the muon in the 1s state of the muonic atom .",
    "the meco experiment at brookhaven had proposed to place a pion production target inside of a graded solenoidal field , which captures @xmath73 with high efficiency , and then transport them through a long solenoid where the charge separation is done , and then onto a stopping target where the conversion takes place , as shown in fig .",
