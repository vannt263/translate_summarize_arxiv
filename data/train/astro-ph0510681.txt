    "the existence of warped accretion discs , in which the orbital plane of the gas varies slowly with radius and possibly with time , is suggested by both observational evidence and theoretical reasoning . of the observational results ,",
    "perhaps the best examples are certain x - ray binary stars , including her x-1 , in which the x - ray source appears to be periodically occulted by a precessing warped disc ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , and a few active galactic nuclei , including ngc  4258 , in which the warped shape of the disc is revealed by maser emission ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical arguments indicate that a fluid disc will be warped by an external torque if it is misaligned with the equatorial plane of a spinning black hole or magnetized star at its centre ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , or with the orbital plane of a binary companion , planet or other satellite ( @xcite ) . even in an initially aligned system ,",
    "the disc may develop a warp through a linear instability of the coplanar state , depending on tidal , radiation or magnetic forces ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "interpreting the behaviour of warped discs is an important and challenging problem in astrophysical fluid dynamics .",
    "the basic aim of theoretical approaches in this subject has been to understand how the shape of the disc evolves under the action of internal stresses and external torques , and to derive practical one - dimensional equations that describe this evolution . when the warp is sufficiently small the governing equations are linear and can be obtained from a perturbation analysis of a flat disc . @xcite and @xcite derived linearized equations for warped discs , superseding the pioneering but flawed analyses of @xcite and @xcite , and demonstrated that there are two basic dynamical regimes for warped keplerian discs in linear theory .",
    "let the disc have angular velocity @xmath3 and vertical scale - height @xmath4 , and let @xmath5 denote the dimensionless effective viscosity parameter of @xcite .",
    "to a first approximation , if @xmath6 the warp satisfies a diffusion - type equation with an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath7 , larger by a factor of @xmath8 than the effective kinematic viscosity of the disc . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath9 the warp satisfies a wave - type equation and propagates with speed @xmath10 .",
    "the rapid diffusive and non - dispersive wavelike behaviours are unique to keplerian discs as they result from a resonance between the orbital and epicyclic frequencies that couples the vertical motion associated with the warp to shearing horizontal epicyclic motions .",
    "a possible limitation of these approaches is that the eulerian perturbation analysis on which the linearized equations are based requires that the vertical displacement be small compared to @xmath11 , and is therefore formally invalid for any observable warp .",
    "it is appreciated that the linear theories may be valid for larger amplitudes but this can only be demonstrated using a lagrangian or semi - lagrangian method .",
    "more recently it has also become possible to test these theories and to study aspects of warped discs using numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such simulations have focused mainly on the wavelike regime @xmath9 and have found reasonable agreement with @xcite for small - amplitude warps .",
    "there are significant discrepancies , however , which suggest that nonlinear and dispersive effects can be important .",
    "a particular concern has been that the shearing epicyclic motions associated with the warp in either regime are predicted to be very fast , comparable to or larger than the sound speed , for observable warps .",
    "shocks may form if the warp has a short enough wavelength that these motions collide @xcite , but the horizontal motions may also be parametrically unstable and decay into smaller - scale inertial waves ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that the shearing motions are also damped by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in a quasi - viscous manner @xcite .",
    "further studies of all these effects are needed to assess their importance .",
    "in earlier work ( @xcite ; @xcite ) i derived a fully nonlinear theory of warped discs with effective viscosity , which agrees with @xcite in the appropriate limit and also bears a formal resemblance to the simplified nonlinear equations adopted by @xcite .",
    "however , the theory of @xcite does not describe the regime of propagating bending waves in keplerian discs with @xmath12 .",
    "it was noted there that the nonlinear dynamics of the wavelike regime is likely to be very different , and the purpose of the present paper is to investigate this important case .    in section  [ s :",
    "leading ] of this paper i review the linear theory of long - wavelength bending waves in keplerian discs and introduce the detailed derivation that follows in section  [ s : derivation ] .",
    "the nonlinear evolutionary equation is analysed and solved numerically in section  [ s : analysis ] and conclusions are presented in section  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "the linearized equations for long - wavelength bending waves in a thin , inviscid , keplerian disc are ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are complex variables describing the warp and the internal torque .",
    "specifically @xmath17 encodes the horizontal cartesian components of the unit vector @xmath18 normal to the plane containing an annulus of the disc at radius @xmath19 and time @xmath20 , while @xmath21 does the same for the horizontal internal torque in the disc ( divided by @xmath22 ) .",
    "also @xmath3 is the angular velocity , @xmath23 is the surface density and @xmath4 is an effective density scale - height , defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the central mass , @xmath26 is the density and @xmath27 is the vertical coordinate in the unperturbed disc . for a vertically isothermal disc @xmath11 is the usual gaussian scale - height .    when @xmath28 is eliminated we obtain @xmath29 which implies that linear bending waves propagate non - dispersively at speed @xmath10 @xcite . if the model of the disc is such that the product @xmath30 is independent of @xmath19 , we obtain the classical wave equation @xmath31 in the conveniently rescaled spatial coordinate @xmath32 with plausible applications and numerical simulations in mind , we consider the case @xmath33 ; then @xmath34 and @xmath35 an outwardly propagating bending wave in this theory has the simple form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is related to the radial velocity amplitude through @xmath38 the function @xmath39 is unconstrained except by the initial conditions , and the wave propagates without change of form .",
    "this long - wavelength theory of bending waves is subject to small corrections depending on the quantity @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the radial wavenumber .",
    "@xcite analysed the linear adiabatic wave modes in a vertically isothermal accretion disc in the case @xmath42 .",
    "the bending wave of interest corresponds to @xmath43 and @xmath44 in their notation , and its dispersion relation in a keplerian disc can be expanded in the form @xmath45 where @xmath0 is the adiabatic index .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side corresponds to the approximation of non - dispersive propagation as obtained in the long - wavelength bending - wave theory , while the second term indicates the primary dispersive correction .",
    "the dispersion depends on the compressibility of the fluid and is a weak effect if the wavelength is long compared to @xmath11 .",
    "nonlinearity will also modify the above theory .",
    "if the nonlinearity is weak and of the same order of magnitude as the linear dispersion , we may expect a similar outwardly propagating wave solution to equation ( [ wave ] ) to exist , except that @xmath39 will no longer be an arbitrary function determined only by the initial conditions , but will evolve according to a nonlinear evolutionary equation . the situation is analogous to the classical problem of long water waves , where weak nonlinearity and dispersion combine in the korteweg  de vries ( kdv ) equation ( e.g. @xcite ) . in that case",
    "nonlinearity and dispersion have competing tendencies and solitary waves ( specifically , solitons ) are found .",
    "another well known example is the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , which arises in diverse fields including nonlinear optics .",
    "if the sign of the nonlinear term is such as to steepen waves , the nls equation also admits solitons .",
    "the kdv and nls equations are recognised as generic nonlinear equations that arise in many applications .    since the bending wave propagates through an inhomogeneous medium",
    ", it is not expected in general that its evolutionary equation will have constant coefficients .",
    "however , it is found below that for the self - similar disc model in which @xmath46 and @xmath34 , which has reasonable scalings and is well suited for numerical simulations , the coefficients of the equation can indeed be made constant by an appropriate choice of coordinates .",
    "the equations governing the dynamics of an ideal , compressible fluid are the equation of mass conservation , @xmath47 the adiabatic condition , @xmath48 and the equation of motion , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the velocity , @xmath51 is the lagrangian time - derivative , @xmath52 is the pressure and @xmath53 is the gravitational potential . for a polytropic gas @xmath0 is a constant .    consider a non - self - gravitating , keplerian disc around a point mass @xmath25 .",
    "the time - dependent warping of the disc is best described in a nonlinear regime using the warped spherical polar coordinate system @xmath54 introduced by @xcite . in this scheme",
    "the warped mid - plane of the disc is defined by the coordinate surface @xmath55 , and the warp consists of a tilt angle @xmath56 together with a twist angle @xmath57 .",
    "the cartesian components of the unit tilt vector are given by @xmath58 .    when expressed in warped coordinates ,",

    "meaningful dynamical equations for @xmath71 and @xmath72 can be obtained only if the disc is thin and is defined to lie close to the surface @xmath55 .",
    "this constraint is implied by the asymptotic analysis that follows .",
    "we utilize the small parameter @xmath73 , such that the angular semi - thickness of the disc is @xmath74 .",
    "the equations are to be expanded in a region of the @xmath75 plane that corresponds to a neighbourhood of the line @xmath76 followed by the nominal centre of an outwardly propagating bending wave at leading order .",
    "( the problem of an inwardly propagating wave can be considered using the time - reversal symmetry of the problem . )",
    "we therefore introduce the scaled variables @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 to resolve the vertical structure of the disc and the evolution of the wave .",
    "these are defined by @xmath80 and the equations are to be valid where @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are @xmath81 . thus @xmath77 is a scaled vertical coordinate relative to the mid - plane of the thin disc , @xmath78 is a scaled horizontal coordinate relative to the nominal centre @xmath76 of the travelling wave , and @xmath79 is a scaled time coordinate that follows the solution over the time - scale on which the radial location of the centre of the wave changes by a factor of order unity . the scaling of @xmath78 means that at any one time the wave is described within a region of radial extent comparable to the geometric mean of @xmath19 and @xmath11 ( figure  1 ) .",

    "the reason can be traced to equation ( [ wave ] ) where it is seen that the amplitude @xmath236 ( or @xmath237 ) determines the non - trivial horizontal velocities as well as the tilt , because the solution under consideration is a wave travelling in one direction .",
    "it is readily verified that solutions exist in the form of uniform travelling waves @xmath238 , where @xmath239 and @xmath41 satisfy the nonlinear dispersion relation @xmath240 such a wave is linearly stable to long - wavelength disturbances if @xmath241\\ge0,\\ ] ] and to short - wavelength disturbances if @xmath242 in the rescaled variables @xmath78 and @xmath229 the ( negative ) linear dispersion coefficient is unity . since @xmath243 and @xmath244 in practice ,",
    "the waves are stable if @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath245 ) and the nonlinear terms increase their dispersion .",
    "therefore it may be expected that solitary waves are not supported , and this appears to be confirmed by the following analysis . however , if @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath246 ) , the waves are unstable except when @xmath247 , and the nonlinearity counteracts the linear dispersion .",
    "following the usual analysis of nls solitons ( e.g.  @xcite ) , we consider more general travelling - wave solutions of the form @xmath248 where @xmath239 is a frequency and @xmath249 is a wave speed to be determined .",
    "note that @xmath249 is a slow speed in rescaled coordinates and is relative to the basic wave speed of @xmath10 .",
    "writing @xmath250 with @xmath251 and @xmath53 real , we then find @xmath252 @xmath253\\phi''+2\\left[1+s(2a+b-1)r^2\\right]r'\\phi'=cr ' . \\label{phipp}\\ ] ] these equations are completely integrable .",

    "we have @xmath258 for @xmath226 , while @xmath259 for @xmath2 .",

    "the analogous particle would roll in a potential well between @xmath266 and @xmath267 such that @xmath268 and @xmath269 for @xmath270 . in this problem , as @xmath263 , the effective potential diverges as @xmath271 , so this behaviour is possible only if @xmath272 . in this case @xmath273^{1-q}+\\left[1+s(2a-1)r^2\\right]^{1 - 2q}\\right\\}-\\frac{1}{2}\\omega",
    "r^2,\\ ] ] and @xmath274 tends to a constant as @xmath263 .",
    "we exclude the trivial case @xmath275 .",
    "it can then be shown that @xmath274 is a strictly concave function of @xmath276 ( i.e. @xmath277 ) when @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath245 and @xmath278 ) .",
    "therefore it is impossible for a potential well to be formed , and we conclude that solitary waves are not supported when @xmath1 .    in contrast , when @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath246 and @xmath279 ) , @xmath274 is a strictly convex function of @xmath276 that diverges to @xmath280 as @xmath276 approaches @xmath281 , and a potential well is always formed .",
    "the squared amplitude @xmath282 can never exceed @xmath281 , so it appears that solitary waves are supported for small amplitudes @xmath283 and stable extended wavetrains for larger amplitudes @xmath284 .",
    "an analytical approximation for the solitary waves in the case @xmath2 is possible when they are of small amplitude @xmath285 . in this limit @xmath286 with @xmath287 the solution of equation ( [ energy ] ) for @xmath288 is then @xmath289 and furthermore @xmath290 . for a specified height ( @xmath291 ) and width ( @xmath292 ) , the frequency @xmath239 and wave speed @xmath249",
    "are determined by these relations .",
    "equation ( [ dnls ] ) was solved numerically by applying a spatial discretization on a uniform grid , based on second - order centred differences , and solving the resulting coupled ordinary differential equations in time using a fifth - order runge ",
    "kutta method with adaptive stepsize .",
    "illustrative solutions for the case @xmath216 are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the initial profile is a real gaussian of relatively large amplitude .",
    "the solution of the linear schrdinger equation , obtained when the nonlinear terms are neglected , can be written in closed form and is shown in the right - hand panels ; it exhibits some linear dispersion .",
    "when the nonlinear terms are included , as shown in the left - hand panels , the wave broadens much more rapidly and there is a greater emission of short waves .",
    "( if their wavelength is comparable to or shorter than @xmath11 it is likely that they will behave differently from the predictions of equation [ dnls ] ) .",
    "the computational domain is large enough that the boundary conditions do not affect the solution significantly for the ranges of @xmath78 and @xmath229 shown .",
    "it was also confirmed numerically that small - amplitude solitary waves in the case @xmath2 propagate according to equation ( [ solitary ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the analysis to include a small effective viscosity .",
    "suppose that the effective shear viscosity is given by @xmath293 , where @xmath5 is independent of @xmath27 and comparable to @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath294 with @xmath295 .",
    "then the viscosity appears in the third - order horizontal forcing terms @xmath296 and @xmath297 , where its effect is to replace @xmath298 by @xmath299 .",
    "indeed , any process that damps the shearing epicyclic motions at a rate @xmath300 would have an equivalent effect .",
    "an effective bulk viscosity of comparable magnitude would not affect the analysis .",
    "the final equation for @xmath236 is modified to @xmath301 where the dots indicate the inviscid dynamical terms found previously .",
    "the dnls equation ( [ dnls ] ) is modified to @xmath302 when @xmath237 is small the effect of viscosity is to cause the solution to decay by a factor @xmath303 relative to the inviscid solution . in general , however , the nonlinearity of the equation means that it is not possible to find such an integrating factor .",
    "we have derived a one - dimensional equation describing the evolution of weakly nonlinear and dispersive bending waves in a thin keplerian accretion disc with negligible viscosity and self - gravity .",
    "the nonlinear and dispersive effects both depend on the compressibility of the gas through its adiabatic exponent @xmath0 .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , in the physically realistic case @xmath1 , nonlinearity tends to broaden the waves and enhance their linear dispersion .",
    "this is in contrast with the ( hypothetical ) case @xmath2 in which nonlinearity counteracts linear dispersion and solitary waves are supported .",
    "linear theories of warped accretion discs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) previously made clear the distinction between the diffusive ( @xmath304 ) and wavelike ( @xmath9 ) regimes in keplerian discs .",
    "since they were based on an eulerian perturbation analysis they could not predict the amplitude at which they would break down . in this paper",
    "it is found that nonlinear effects cause a significant modification of the bending wave ( as the radial location of the wave changes by a factor of order unity ) when the dimensionless amplitude of the warp @xmath305 is @xmath306 and the horizontal velocities are comparable to the sound speed .",
    "unfortunately it is difficult to explain in simple terms how these critical scalings arise or why the nonlinearity is steepening only when @xmath2 .",
    "the nonlinearity arises through a mode - coupling process and is complicated further by the resonant nature of the epicyclic oscillations in a keplerian disc , arising from the coincidence of the orbital and epicyclic frequencies .",
    "the analysis in this paper does not by any means present a complete description of the nonlinear dynamics of the wavelike regime .",
    "we have focused on the evolution of a travelling bending wave and have not considered the interaction between inward and outward waves , nor the important case of steady warps maintained by an external torque .",
    "furthermore , @xcite noted that shocks can form if the wavelength of the warp is short enough that the shearing epicyclic motions from different parts of the wave collide .",
    "this effect typically requires @xmath305 to be @xmath81 .",
    "@xcite also noted that the warp could decay through a parametric instability .",
    "the critical amplitude for this effect is proportional to the effective viscosity of the disc .    it would be interesting to compare the predictions of this analysis with the results of numerical simulations of warped discs .",
    "if parametric instability sets in there should be a noticeable deviation from equation  ( [ dnls ] ) . the best way to make",
    "this comparison would be to set up a vertically isothermal disc with @xmath46 and @xmath112 , to introduce a warp and the accompanying horizontal velocities ( [ vh1 ] ) , and to follow the evolution of the complex tilt @xmath15 . the comparison with solutions of equation  ( [ dnls ] ) could then be made by transforming variables from @xmath15 to @xmath307 , or vice versa .",
