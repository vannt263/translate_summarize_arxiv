    "gamma cassiopeiae is a b0.5 i ve star which has been extensively studied at optical wavelengths .",
    "it is also a moderately strong x - ray source ( @xmath610@xmath7erg  s@xmath5 ) and is believed to form part of a binary system , based on its similarities to the be x - ray binary , x persei ( mason et al .",
    "1976 ) . however , despite two decades of intense study , its status as an x - ray binary remains unclear .",
    "the phenomenological model of @xmath0cas has been derived largely from optical interferometric and spectropolarmetric measurements ( e.g. , horaguchi et al .",
    "1994 ; stee et al . 1995 ; quirrenbach et al .",
    "they reveal a pronounced mass loss from the system ( which implies that material is available for accretion onto a companion ) and the presence of a substantial circumstellar envelope , which in turn , may provide the source of material for a companion to accrete from ( vakili et al .",
    "the presence of a companion is inferred from the observed oscillations in the ratio of v / r peak intensities in double peaked h@xmath8 line profiles .",
    "additional evidence is provided by an analysis of a 20  ks exosat observation by frontera et al .",
    "( 1987 ) . in the 28  kev energy range ,",
    "the observed x - ray flux is @xmath62 orders of magnitude greater than that expected for a star with spectral class earlier than a ( pallavicini et al .",
    "1981 ) and the 220  kev spectrum is consistent with that commonly observed in low luminosity be / neutron binary star systems",
    ". the derived spectral index is @xmath61.5 for a power - law interpretation , or alternately , a temperature of @xmath61015  kev for optically thin bremsstrahlung emission . a timing analysis of the data failed to shed any insight into the orbital dynamics of the system , but did suggest a possible period of @xmath6100 mins . however , parmar et al . (",
    "1997 ) found no evidence for this periodicity in a subsequent 30  hr continuous exosat observation , suggesting instead that the apparent periodicity is produced by statistical fluctuations .",
    "in common with many other x - ray binaries , chaotic x - ray variability with no preferred timescale down to @xmath610  s has also been observed ( kubo et al .",
    "1988 ) and is thought to arise from fluctuations in the rate of accretion onto the compact object .",
    "its x - ray luminosity of 10@xmath7 ergs s@xmath5 is consistent with both coronal emission ( as observed from ob stars ) and wind powered emission from either a neutron star or white dwarf .",
    "however , the measured temperature of @xmath612  kev is much hotter than found in ob stars , which usually have temperatures in the range @xmath60.52.5 kev .",
    "evidence that the compact companion in the @xmath0cas system is actually a white dwarf , rather than a neutron star , is strongly suggested by the _",
    "observation of strong fe line emission at 6.8  kev of equivalent width , ew , 280  ev ( murakami et al . 1986 ) .",
    "this implies a highly ionized plasma of temperature , @xmath9 @xmath610  kev which is commonly seen in white dwarf systems ( mukai & shiokawa 1993 ) .",
    "high mass neutron star accreting systems , on the other hand , usually show fe emission at 6.4  kev , with occasionally weak ( ew@xmath10  ev ) emission at 6.7  kev .",
    "an 8.4  ks rosat pspc observation of @xmath0cas ( haberl 1995 ) revealed evidence for a soft component which can be modeled as black body radiation of kt@xmath6200  ev . it is believed to emanate from the heated surface of a white dwarf near the magnetic pole .",
    "this component appears to be modulated with a period of 135.3 mins which may be the spin period of the white dwarf .",
    "the modulation may then arise from geometrical self occultation by the white dwarf ( king & shaviv 1984 ) , or by photoelectric absorption , as in the accretion curtain model of rosen et al .",
    "based on a possible stellar modulation in the chaotic x - ray emission and a similarity ( spectrally and temporally ) to late - type flaring stars ( such as rs cvns ) , smith et al .",
    "( 1998 ) proposed a mechanism in which x - rays are produced in magnetically generated hot spots on the surface of @xmath0cas itself .",
    "such an origin would be consistent with the apparent lack of orbital motion and the active be nature of the star .",
    "in this paper we report on simultaneous optical and x - ray measurements with the bepposax satellite and present the first 0.150  kev broad - band energy spectrum of @xmath0cas .",
    "as @xmath0cas was one of the first stars observed to display the characteristics nowadays categorized as be star phenomenon , the collection of optical observations covers a very long time baseline ( e.g. , afoev 1998 ) .",
    "based on photometric and spectroscopic peculiarities in common with other be stars , doazan et al .",
    "( 1983 ) describe a three phased `` cycle '' in the long term behavior of @xmath0cas , without implying any periodicity .",
    "such a cycle starts with the building - up of balmer emission .",
    "this phase is characterized by moderate irregular variability in the balmer line intensities as well as in the visual magnitude .",
    "the line intensities and magnitudes show a slow increase over several decades ( be phase ) .",
    "this behavior culminates in a second phase of high variability in both characteristics ( be - shell phase ) lasting approximately 10 years , which was last observed in @xmath0cas from 1932 to 1942 .",
    "the cycle is terminated by a third phase with no detectable be characteristics ( b - normal phase ) lasting about 5 years .",
    "the visual magnitude of @xmath0cas has more or less continuously risen from its early be phase value of about 26 in 1950 to a present value of @xmath622 .",
    "contemporaneous to the bepposax observations , optical monitoring of @xmath0cas was carried out with universitts - sternwarte mnchen s 80@xmath11 cm telescope located at the wendelstein observatory .",
    "measurements were made using the monica instrument in johnson b , v and r around 01:50 ut on 1998 , july 21 .",
    "the measured magnitudes were : b=2.18@xmath10.06 , v=2.23@xmath10.02 and r=2.36@xmath10.03 , which confirms the `` normal '' behavior of @xmath0cas at this time .",
    "moreover , the resulting b ",
    "v=@xmath12005 is in perfect agreement with a correlation between visual magnitude and b - v color index described by horaguchi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , which shows that , the brighter the v magnitude of @xmath0cas , the redder it becomes in b  v .",
    "this trend is commonly interpreted as being due to the growth of a circumstellar envelope with time . in summary , @xmath0cas , as indicated by its visual observables , is currently in a late but rather normal be phase , with no obvious signs of a transition to the spectacular be - shell phase .",
    "the x - ray observation was carried out using the bepposax astronomy satellite ( boella et al .",
    "the platform contains four coaligned narrow field instruments ( nfi ) providing broad - band coverage over the energy range 0.1 to 300 kev .",
    "the nfi are : the low energy and medium energy concentrator spectrometers ( lecs and mecs ) , the high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc ) and the phoswich detection system ( pds ) .",
    "the lecs covers the energy range 0.110  kev with an energy resolution of 8% at 6  kev ( parmar et al .",
    "the mecs consists of three detectors similar to the lecs , with identical energy resolution but with thicker entrance windows , spanning 1.310  kev ( boella et al .",
    "the hpgspc is sensitive over the energy range 4120  kev with an energy resolution of 4% at 60  kev ( manzo et al .",
    "the pds covers the high energy range 13300  kev with an energy resolution of 15% at 60  kev ( frontera et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "@xmath0cas was observed from 1998 july 20 11:21 utc to july 21 22:15 utc , yielding total on - source exposure times of 10.2 , 37.4 , 20.0 and 18.6 ks in the lecs , mecs , hpgspc and pds , respectively .",
    "data were processed with the saxdas data analysis system using standard procedures .",
    "for the lecs and mecs , source events were extracted from regions of radii 8 and 4@xmath13 , respectively , centered on the source position .",
    "spectral fitting was carried out using xspec ( version 10.1 ) .",
    "the lecs data were fit over the energy range 0.1 to 10  kev ; the mecs 1.85 to 10  kev ; the hpgspc 7 to 65  kev and the pds 13 to 200  kev . to ensure that the fitting statistic ( @xmath14 ) was unbiased across the entire energy range",
    ", data were rebinnned to a width of 33% of the full width at half maximum energy resolution function of each instrument and also under the condition that each bin contained a minimum of 20 counts .",
    "it is known from inter - instrument spectral calibrations that there can be small position dependent normalization differences between the instruments .",
    "therefore , these factors were included as free multiplicative parameters during multiple nfi spectral fitting .",
    "fig . 1 shows low and high energy light curves measured by the mecs ( 1.310.0 kev ) and the pds ( 13200  kev ) after background subtraction .",
    "the time resolution is 400  s. the source intensity is clearly variable with a doubling of the flux occurring on the time scale of adjacent bins .",
    "the fastest observed fluctuation in the mecs is on a time scale of @xmath610  s , consistent with the asca result of kubo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in the pds ,",
    "the fastest observable variation is of the order of @xmath640  s. this time scale implies an upper limit on the size of the emission region of a few @xmath3 10@xmath15  cm .",
    "next a search for periodic variations was carried out . on short time",
    "scales ( @xmath1610@xmath170.5  hz ) , a power density curve reveals a @xmath18type distribution , but no clear periodicities ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . at much longer periods ,",
    "a period search reveals weak enhancements at 35 and 145 mins .",
    "we estimate that for narrow qpo / periodicities in the 0.01 hz to 0.1 hz range , we could detect a 10% amplitude modulation at the 3@xmath19 level .    in order to study the long - term x - ray variability of @xmath0cas ,",
    "we have also analyzed r - xte all sky monitor ( asm ) data which has continuously observed the source from 1996 february , 20 to 1998 december , 31 .",
    "we have searched for periods in the range 30500 days using the lomb - scargle periodogram , using both the individual dwell and 1-day averages data .",
    "no peaks with a high significance ( i.e. , @xmath2099% ) were found in the individual dwell data , although one peak at a period of @xmath6200 days was of marginal significance ( at the @xmath690% level ) . as a check on its reality , we replaced the r - xte asm measurements with data drawn from a gaussian distribution centered on zero with a @xmath19 of 1 ( i.e. no signal ) .",
    "we note that the peak still existed ( albeit with a much lower significance ) , implying that it is probably caused by a windowing effect and therefore does not reflect a true period in the x - ray flux of @xmath0cas .",
    "analysis of the 1-day averaged data yielded similar results , i.e. , no significant periodicities .",
    "we estimate that for periods around 100 days , we would have detected a 10% periodic modulation at the 90% confidence level .",
    "simple models ( i.e. , power - laws , bremsstrahlung , etc . ) gave poor fits to the data .",
    "for example , an absorbed power - law gives a @xmath21 of 684 for 203 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the addition of an iron line at 6.77@xmath10.03  kev improves the fit significantly ( @xmath21/dof=505/200 ) , but is still unacceptable at energies above 10  kev . based on previous rosat and asca measurements ( haberl 1995 ; kubo et al .",
    "1998 ) , we next investigated optically thin thermal plasma models with both the temperature and elemental abundance as free parameters .",
    "the results are listed in table 1 . a best - fit mekal model , based in the calculations of mewe and kaastra ( mewe et al . 1986 ; kaastra 1992 ) yields a @xmath21/dof of 266/202 for a fitted temperature of 12.5@xmath10.7  kev and an abundance of 0.43@xmath10.05 .",
    "these values are in agreement with the asca values of 10.7@xmath22  kev and 0.35@xmath10.08 ( kubo et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the fit shows significant residuals around 300  ev and 1  kev .",
    "the addition of a carbon line at 277  ev results in a better fit ( @xmath21/dof=244/199 ) , which is significant under an @xmath23 test ( p@xmath2099.9% ) .",
    "if real , this could imply an overabundance of carbon .",
    "following the rosat observation of a soft component , we next added a blackbody component .",
    "this resulted in a slightly worse fit ( @xmath21/dof=248/201 ) primarily due to residuals around 0.3  kev .",
    "the fitted temperature was 100@xmath2  ev , which is consistent with the rosat value of 200@xmath110  ev ( haberl 1995 ) .",
    "assuming that the source is best described in terms of a multi  temperature plasma , we replaced the blackbody component with a second , lower temperature , mekal component .",
    "the resulting @xmath21/dof is 240/200 for temperatures of 12.3@xmath10.6  kev and 0.05@xmath10.01  kev .",
    "the fitted abundance is 0.423@xmath240.06 , consistent with previous measurements . whereas rosat reported marked variability in the soft component and suggested a possible modulation period of 135 mins , our data are consistent with a constant mean rate throughout the observation .",
    "for example , in the 0.1 to 0.5  kev band , a best  fit constant mean rate yields a @xmath21/dof of 64/57 , as compared to 423/64 for the 0.110  kev band .",

    "the comparison of bepposax results with previous results can be misleading in view of the limited energy range of early missions  meaning that the results can be critically dependent on assumed emission models which may be inappropriate for the wide bandwidth of bepposax .",
    "for example , asca data are perfectly consistent with a power  law continuum whereas bepposax data are not , when energies above the asca upper energy threshold are taken into account .",
    "globally , the bepposax data show that the @xmath0cas spectrum is consistent with an optically thin thermal plasma distribution which does not require non - thermal components  as might be expected for accreting neutron star models .",
    "the fe line is a persistent feature of this source and is generally attributed to a blend of fe xxv ( 6.7  kev ) line emission and fe xxvi ( 6.97  kev ) emission produced in a highly ionized , optically thin thermal plasma .",
    "the implied temperature of @xmath612  kev is perfectly consistent with that derived independently for the continuum .",
    "such emission is most consistent with white dwarf scenarios .",
    "high mass neutron star systems , on the other hand , generally have strong emission at 6.4  kev and only weak , if any , emission at 6.7  kev . also , such systems generally have non - thermal spectra which are well described by a power - law distribution with a high energy cut - off and may be expected to produce cyclotron line emission above @xmath610  kev .",
    "none of these are observed by bepposax .    until recently",

    "( 1995 ) , the observed luminosity is no longer in conflict with current limits on the orbital motion .",
