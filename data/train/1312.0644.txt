    "<S> in contrast , the knight shift and @xmath30 for fields parallel to the layers of sr@xmath31ruo@xmath32 , are inconsistent with one another@xcite . in the magnificent case of urhge , </S>",
    "<S> there has been strong evidence of an anomalous high - field reentrant superconducting phase measured in clean samples with residual resistance ratio rrr = 50 @xcite , where the superconductivity was found to disappear at a relatively low field strength @xcite , but then reappears when the strength of the external field exceeds 8 t@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness of the superconductivity in high fields is a signature of parallel - spin pairing , and can not be easily explained using conventional bcs @xmath25-wave pairing . </S>",

    "<S> in addition to the mysterious reentrant superconductivity observed in clean samples of urhge , shubnikov de haas ( sdh ) measurements were also performed on even cleaner samples of urhge with an rrr=130 , from which yelland _ et al . _ observed a sudden disappearance of sdh oscillations in the field - dependent resistance , @xmath34 for @xmath35 t @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> those authors claimed the disappearance of the sdh oscillations was due to a topological lifshitz fermi surface ( fs ) transition , where the field - dependent cross - sectional area of the fs , @xmath36 , suddenly vanishes , quenching the sdh oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> they attributed this effect partially to a decrease in the effective cyclotron mass @xmath37 , but primarily to a decrease in the field - dependent fermi velocity , @xmath38 with a smooth drop to zero at around 15 t in the wave vector @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> yelland _ </S>",

    "<S> et al . _ further attributed the dramatic re - entrance into the superconducting state of urhge at high magnetic fields in the @xmath43-direction as a direct consequence of this . </S>",
    "<S> however , a similar effect in ucoge was claimed to be due to anomalies in the effective mass @xmath44@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thermopower measurements at large fields provided strong evidence for a change in the fs in ucoge@xcite , but no such change at the reentrant field in urhge@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as noted in the most recent review article on the subject , it is presently unclear as to whether the fs changes dramatically with @xmath20 , as in a vanishing of the average fermi wavevector @xmath45 , or whether the effective mass is strongly enhanced with @xmath20@xcite </S>",
