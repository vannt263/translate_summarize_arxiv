    "entanglement exists in the core of many aspects of quantum field theory and statistical mechnaics and it is therefore desirable to understand its structure as well as possible using gauge - grvaity duality @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one attempt to improve our understanding of entanglement is the study of our ability to perform calculations on asymptotic anti de sitter bulk models .",
    "this is due to the celebrated anti de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) conjecture , which it relates the weakly coupled gravitational theory in bulk to the strongly coupled quantum theory in a flat boundary @xcite .",
    "this conjecture provides a framework to study the role of entanglement entropy of a quantum system in terms of minimal surfaces @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the holographic entanglement entropy ( hee ) of a quantum system in boundary is defined as the entropy of a region of space @xmath0 and its complement on the minimal surfaces in @xmath1 using gauge - gravity duality @xcite,@xcite :    @xmath2    for time - independent backgrounds we need to compute the minimal area of a region in bulk with the same boundary @xmath3 with the quantum system in boundary .",
    "another surprising development is that there exist a time dependent formulation of hee using extremal surfaces instead of minimal ones @xcite .",
    "this approach used to study hee in the time - dependent janus background @xcite .",
    "the technique is to replace `` minimal '' with `` extremal '' surfaces : @xmath4.\\label{hee}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in case of multiple extremal surfaces , we should select the extremal surface with the minimum area included in them .    here",
    "we discuss the issue of hee for two dimensional time dependent holographic superconductors @xcite-@xcite , and show that in this regime the hee and phase transition can be achieved .",
    "the bulk action with an abelian gauge field @xmath6 in the presence of a generally massive scalar field @xmath7 with charge @xmath8 and mass @xmath9 was selected in order to determine the two dimensional holographic superconductor @xcite-@xcite , @xmath10,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath11 is the ads radius , and @xmath12 with @xmath13 , maxwell tensor is @xmath14 . for the sake of simplicity ,",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the advantage of using ads / cft set up was that the dual cft temperature could be obtained as the hawking temperature of the horizon ( denoted by @xmath17 ) by the following formula : @xmath18 the ads boundary was located at @xmath19 , which provided initial data for scalar field and of a physical sources for the scalar operator @xmath20 . because the conformal scaling was used for field theory , conformal dimension was defined using two conformal dimensions @xmath21 . in this report",
    "we study the case of @xmath22,@xmath23 + the _ vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the corresponding boundary quantum field theory operators _ basically can be computeted using the following variations of the effective and renormalized action @xmath24 : @xmath25 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the renormalized action : @xmath27 and by dot we mean derivative with respect to the time coordinate @xmath28 .",
    "an alternative form for metric could be find using the coordinate transformation @xmath29 in the metric on ads boundary . under this transformation",
    "the metric becomes flat which is neccesary to construct cft .",
    "the new non static ( time dependent ) form of metric is given by the following : @xmath30\\label{metric2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this coordinate @xmath31 , the black hole horizon @xmath32 mapps to @xmath33 and the conformal ( ads ) boundary @xmath19 mapps to the @xmath34 .",

    "it was shown that the area per entangled length @xmath37 is a monotonic - increasing function .",
    "this quantity shows that the system remains on a regular phase of matter for @xmath38 or equivalently for @xmath39 .",
    "regular attendance at these non superconducting phase has proved numerically .",
    "boundary conditions and regular tiny parameter @xmath40 will help to keep normal phase for longer .",
    "a more interesting observation is that the hardenability to form normal phase becomes more harder with the increase of entropy @xmath37 .      in disconnected phase",
    ", we should compute the extremal area of the disconnected surfaces as a function of boundary coordinates @xmath41.we show that the coserved charge @xmath42 of the associated euler - lagrange system of the eqs . plays the role of the critical parameter .",
    "a numerical computation shows that when @xmath43 , the normalized area per length @xmath37 is a monotonic - decreasing function .",
    "near @xmath44 we can simplify write the time evolution of the extremal path as the following @xmath45 where @xmath46 are functions of @xmath47 . in this case with disconnected areas , we detect that the extremal area per length is always decreasing .",
    "it produces a regular phase of matter for @xmath48 .",
    "further more we can show that the hee is a linear function of total length @xmath49 .",
    "the simple physical reason backs to the _ emergence of new extra degrees of freedom in small values of belt length ( small sizes)_.",
    "we investigated holographic entanglement entropy of dual quantum systems using a time dependent version of ads spacetime . by a numerical computation we demonstrated that hee is a monotonic - decreasing function .",
    "it is always decreasing .",
    "it produces a regular phase of matter for a critical value @xmath48 .",
    "we showed that @xmath50 is proportional to the numbers of degrees of freedom ( dof ) of the system @xmath51 .",
