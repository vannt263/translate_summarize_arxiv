    "as we prepare for the restart of the lhc in 2015 , it is an ideal time to take stock of what we have learned from run i at 7 - 8  tev .",
    "since most lhc searches have been updated to the full dataset ( 20  fb@xmath9 at 8  tev ) , we can now endeavor to glean as much insight from them as possible .",
    "the discovery of a standard model - like higgs at 125  gev  @xcite reinforces the urgency of the hierarchy problem , for which supersymmetry ( susy ) remains one of the best - motivated candidates for a natural solution . for reviews encompassing both",
    "the theory of natural susy and recent lhc results , see  @xcite .",
    "numerous susy searches at the lhc have so far only provided null results , which have been used to place stringent limits on a diverse array of models and `` simplified models '' .",
    "however , it is far from clear how to use this collection of limits to reach general conclusions about all possible forms of natural susy .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to clarify the status of natural susy by focusing on the question : _ to what extent do existing 8  tev searches exclude natural models with a kinematically accessible gluino ? _ large classes of models have clearly been excluded , but it is plausible that gaps in coverage remain .",
    "our objective in this paper is to seek these gaps and to understand their origins .",
    "we will accomplish this by viewing the space of natural supersymmetric models in a very general way , and then exploring the constraints placed on this space by relevant lhc searches .",
    "we are motivated to focus on gluino pair production in this paper , because the gluino has the highest production rate ( for a given mass ) of any particle required by naturalness to be accessible at the lhc ( though possibly not until 14  tev ) .",
    "the kinematic limit at run i of the lhc ( @xmath10  20  fb@xmath9 at 8  tev ) corresponds to @xmath11  tev .",
    "clearly there will be some models with gluinos between 1 and 1.5  tev that are kinematically accessible but difficult to detect , or that require a statistical combination of multiple searches for sensitivity ( see , e.g. , the recent study of  @xcite ) , which we will not pursue here . gaps where the gluino can still be lighter than 1  tev , where more than @xmath12 gluino pairs would have been produced , would be much more interesting . here",
    ", we will argue that there are very few classes of models that are not yet convincingly ruled out for @xmath13  tev , and we will identify how such models evade current searches .    in order for our conclusions about natural susy to be as general as possible , we will not restrict ourselves to any specific theoretical framework .",
    "in particular , we will not concern ourselves with quantifying fine - tuning in specific weak - scale models ( which requires making assumptions about the uv theory ) , preferring instead to focus on the more experimentally driven question of what the current limits are on general spectra , with our only assumption being the presence of light higgsinos , @xmath14  gev .",
    "the upper limit on the higgsino mass is motivated by the fact that this mass typically contributes to the electroweak vev at tree level . if one assumes that the electroweak scale is protected _",
    "purely by supersymmetry _ ( not combined with any other symmetry or dynamical effect ) , then the lightest higgsino mass and the higgs boson mass can not be too far separated without fine tuning .",
    "( the models we study will typically contain light stops , @xmath15  tev , which is also demanded by naturalness , but this assumption is not crucial for our conclusions .",
    "examples of naturalness discussions which push the higgsinos and stops to near these boundaries are found in  @xcite . )",
    "we will be agnostic about both the rest of the superpartner spectrum ( including particles beyond the mssm ) and how it arises from a high - energy theory , allowing the low - energy phenomenology to be completely general in principle . in practice , we will attempt to address this very wide set of scenarios by studying a limited number of models that we believe are sufficient for us to draw conservative lessons about natural susy .    to understand our approach ,",
    "whose overall logic we will explain more carefully in section  [ sec : approach ] , it is very useful to keep in mind a benchmark scenario with a minimal natural spectrum : a gluino ( @xmath16 ) , top squark ( @xmath17 ) and higgsinos ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , where the neutralino @xmath20 is a stable lsp and @xmath21 .",
    "( for some recent studies of models of this type in the context of the lhc , see  @xcite . ) here , decays of pair - produced gluinos such as @xmath22 result in three characteristic properties that can be used to distinguish them from standard model ( sm ) backgrounds :      importantly , _",
    "these three features are common far beyond this simplified model . _",
    "a large @xmath0signal is typical in simple @xmath1-parity preserving susy models and even many @xmath1-parity violating ones .",
    "gluino decays into tops are a generic feature of a vast range of natural models due to the presence of top squarks .",
    "even when @xmath27 is kinematically forbidden , off - shell processes such as @xmath28 can dominate the gluino decays .",
    "finally , high multiplicity is very common , especially in models with little or no @xmath0 .",
    "whereas in many classic susy models gluinos commonly decay to two jets plus an invisible sm lsp ( the lightest superpartner of any standard model state ) , the visible or mostly visible decay of the sm lsp typically provides at least two additional objects .",
    "any additional steps in the cascade ( e.g. , from @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 emission or from decays via sleptons ) also add to the multiplicity , as do top quarks .",
    "thus , in many models , eight or more objects are common in gluino pair events . in short ,",
    "the value of focusing on limits from @xmath0 , tops and high multiplicity is that few natural models lack all of these signatures .",
    "it is easy to eliminate one or even two , but far from trivial to eliminate all three .    in this paper",
    ", our strategy will be to argue that _ any one _ of the three signatures listed above is typically enough to rule out the model for @xmath32  tev . to build our case",
    ", we will study a number of modifications to the minimal benchmark scenario which allow us to interpolate between different combinations of these three signatures . to construct such models",
    ", we will be employing one or more of the following features :    * _ baryonic @xmath1-parity violation ( rpv)_. by allowing the lsp to decay to jets through a @xmath33 operator ( for a review , see  @xcite ) , we can completely eliminate the @xmath0 but generally at the cost of high multiplicity . * _ hidden valley ( hv ) scenarios_. here we allow the lsp to decay to additional `` hidden - valley '' particles  @xcite . by tuning the masses of these particles , the @xmath0can be smoothly interpolated between typical @xmath1-parity conserving mssm values and zero , again with a higher , but easily adjustable , multiplicity . *",
    "_ light second - generation squarks . _",
    "although the first - generation squarks are highly constrained by current searches due to their large production rate through valence quarks , the second - generation squarks are free to be much lighter  @xcite . by lowering the masses of second - generation squarks",
    ", we can reduce the branching ratios of final states with tops by providing more decay modes @xmath34 .    by reinterpreting a comprehensive set of atlas and cms searches ,",
    "we have studied the limits on the gluino mass as a function of the parameters of these scenarios .",
    "since the limits we present come from searches that are signature - driven and are not optimized for particular models , we argue that our results are largely independent of the specific models we chose to study , and thus apply broadly to all natural models that are dominated by similar signatures .",
    "one of our main findings is that out of the multitude of existing lhc searches , only a handful of atlas and cms searches are truly essential for constraining most natural susy models .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab : searches ] .",
    "of course , many other searches ( e.g. , multi - lepton searches ) constrain some part of natural susy parameter space .",
    "but the ones we highlight here form a minimal inclusive set which we believe cover the greatest range of natural susy models with an accessible gluino , not including models that are easily excluded by the presence of many leptons or photons .",
    "in particular ,    * to constrain models with @xmath0requires the standard low - multiplicity high-@xmath0searches ( such as  @xcite and part of  @xcite ) combined with high - multiplicity low-@xmath0searches ( such as  @xcite and another part of  @xcite ) . *",
    "to constrain models with tops as effectively as possible requires the same high - multiplicity / low-@xmath0searches combined with a search , previously proposed in  @xcite , for a lepton , a @xmath23 and many jets , with little or no @xmath0requirement .",
    "we will frequently refer to this as the lsst search , after the authors of  @xcite .",
    "see appendix  [ app : lsst ] for details . * to constrain models with high multiplicity requires yet again the high - multiplicity low-@xmath0searches , combined with the constraints from the atlas search for 6 - 7 high-@xmath2 jets ( without a @xmath0requirement )  @xcite and the control and signal regions of the cms black hole ( bh ) search  @xcite , which we re - analyzed in a very conservative manner for this particular purpose .",
    "few natural models with a gluino below 1  tev survive this lethal net of searches .. said another way , most models that are ruled out at all are covered by two or more lhc searches , which provides confidence that the exclusion is robust .",
    "we will see some exceptions later .",
    "] this is illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig : money ] . among models that can survive are ones that lack @xmath0and tops , and whose jets have a large hierarchy in @xmath2 , such that they fail the uniformly hard @xmath2 cuts of the atlas 6 - 7 jets search .",

    "is modeled reliably up until the compressed region @xmath36 , in which the missing energy becomes very sensitive to isr . in part due to this modeling subtlety , we discuss such compressed spectra separately ( see in particular section  [ subsec : othermods ] ) .",
    "our limits from the cms jets + @xmath0search  @xcite are a bit weaker than those computed by cms , but this is expected , as we do not statistically combine bins .",
    "similarly , our limits from atlas 710 jets + low met  @xcite are weaker as we use only the best bin rather than the correlated fit used in the study ( as discussed in section  6.1 of  @xcite ) .",
    "overall , we find , based on these and many other tests , that despite the different simulation tools and statistical approaches , we reproduce the official experimental results quite closely , and that our claims of exclusion by a factor of 2 ( in the cross section ) are robust claims of exclusion ."
