    "setting @xmath7 , we can transform ( [ 1eq1.3 ] ) into a steady - state schrdinger equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 historically , methods developed for the schrdinger equation have been applied to the study of the fokker - planck equation . but this should be the other way around as well .",
    "theoretically , the fokker - planck equation is often more convenient to deal with than the schrdinger equation . with the fokker - planck equation",
    "we can carry out a more systematic analysis , and the results obtained for the fokker - planck equation can be applied to quantum - mechanical problems described by the schrdinger equation . in this paper , we study the high - energy ( large-@xmath11 ) behavior of the green function for ( [ 1eq1.3 ] ) or , equivalently , ( [ 1eq1.4 ] ) .",

    "one - dimensional quantum scattering has a long history .",
    "in particular , high - energy asymptotic behavior of the green function and related functions have been studied over the decades by both physicists and mathematicians .",
    "this classical topic has recently attracted attention in connection with inverse problems and the theory of integrable systems , and this area of research remains active even to the present day @xcite@xcite .",
    "an essential matter in the study of an asymptotic expansion is the estimation of the remainder term . in conventional methods , which are mostly based on an integral equation ,",
    "it is necessary to impose strong conditions on the potential in order to control the remainder term .",
    "for example , the integrability of @xmath12 is often required . for non - integrable @xmath12",

    "there has not yet been a formalism in which the asymptotic analysis of the green function can be carried out systematically and in a unified way for a variety of potentials that may not necessarily be integrable and that may not even be finite as @xmath13 . in this paper , we take a totally new approach to this problem , and present a new method for the high - energy analysis of the green function which is applicable to a larger class of potentials .    our method is based on the analysis of reflection coefficients .",
    "reflection coefficients are fundamental quantities in scattering theory , and they serve as building blocks for constructing the green function .",
    "the green function can be expressed solely in terms of reflection coefficients for semi - infinite intervals @xcite .",
    "high - energy behavior of the reflection coefficients was studied in a previous paper @xcite , and formulas for their asymptotic expansion were derived there . in the present paper , we apply these results to the green function , and derive the expansion in powers of the inverse wave number .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion are expressed in a simple form in terms of a linear operator , and the remainder term is expressed in terms of transmission and reflection coefficients for finite intervals .",
    "the validity of the asymptotic expansion can be studied by using this expression for the remainder term .",
    "the short - time expansion of the green function can also be obtained by this method .",
