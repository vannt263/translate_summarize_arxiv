    "polarized mller scattering has been a well - studied low - energy reaction for close to eight decades now @xcite , but has attracted especially active interest from both experimental and theoretical communities due to the recent rapid progress in measuring spin - dependent observables . since the nineties the interaction has allowed the high - precision determination of the electron - beam polarization at slc @xcite , slac @xcite @xcite , jlab @xcite and mit - bates @xcite .",
    "a mller polarimeter may also be useful in future experiments planned at the ilc @xcite .",
    "in addition , polarized mller scattering can be an excellent tool for measuring parity - violating ( pv ) weak interaction asymmetries @xcite .",
    "the first observation of parity violation in mller scattering was made by the e-158 experiment at slac @xcite , which studied mller scattering of 45- to 48-gev polarized electrons on the unpolarized electrons in a hydrogen target .",
    "its result at low @xmath1 = 0.026 @xmath2 , @xmath3 @xcite allowed one of the most important parameters in the standard model ",
    "the sine of the weinberg angle  to be determined with an accuracy of 0.5% ( @xmath4 = 0.2403 @xmath5 0.0013 in the @xmath6 scheme ) .",
    "a very promising experiment measuring the e - p scattering asymmetry currently running at jefferson lab , qweak @xcite , aims to determine @xmath7 with relative precision of 0.3% .",
    "the next - generation experiment to study e - e scattering  moller , planned at jlab following the 11 gev upgrade  will offer a new level of sensitivity and measure the parity - violating asymmetry in the scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons off an unpolarized target to a precision of 0.73 ppb . that would allow a determination of the weak mixing angle with an uncertainty of @xmath8 @xcite , or about 0.1% , an improvement of a factor of five in fractional precision when compared with the e-158 measurement .",
    "since mller scattering is a very clean process with a well - known initial energy and low backgrounds , any inconsistency with the standard model will signal new physics .",
    "mller scattering experiments can provide indirect access to physics at multi - tev scales and play an important complementary role to the lhc research program @xcite .",
    "obviously , before we can extract reliable information from the experimental data , it is necessary to take into account higher order effects of electroweak theory , i.e. electroweak radiative corrections ( ewc ) .",
    "the inclusion of ewc is an indispensable part of any modern experiment , but will be of the paramount importance for the ultra - precise measurement of the weak mixing angle via 11 gev mller scattering planned at jlab . in general , from the theory point of view , the interpretability of e - e scattering is exceptionally good .",
    "however , to match the precision of moller experiment , theoretical predictions for the pv e - e scattering asymmetry must include not only full treatment of one - loop radiative corrections ( nlo ) but also leading two - loop corrections ( nnlo ) .    a significant theoretical effort has been dedicated to one - loop radiative corrections already .",
    "a short review of the literature to date on that topic is done in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we also calculated a full gauge - invariant set of the one - loop ewc both numerically with no simplifications using feynarts @xcite , formcalc @xcite , looptools @xcite and form @xcite as the base languages and by hand in a compact form analytically free from nonphysical parameters .",
    "the total correction was found to be close to @xmath9% , and we found no significant theoretical uncertainty coming from the largest possible source , the hadronic contributions to the vacuum polarization .",
    "the dependence on other uncertain input parameters , like the mass of the higgs boson , was below 0.1% .",
    "it is possible that a much larger theoretical uncertainty in the prediction for the asymmetry may come from two - loop corrections .",
    "paper @xcite argued that the higher order corrections are suppressed by a factor of either about 0.1% or 5% ( depending on a type of corrections ) relative to the one - loop result .",
    "however , since the one - loop weak corrections for mller scattering are so large and since the 11 gev moller experiment is striving for such unprecedented precision , we believe it is now worth looking into evaluating two - loop weak corrections .    one way to find some indication of the size of higher - order contributions is to compare results that are expressed in terms of quantities related to different renormalization schemes . in @xcite , we provided a tuned comparison between the result obtained with different renormalization conditions , first within one scheme then between two schemes .",
    "our calculations in the on - shell and cdr schemes show a difference of about 11% , which is comparable with the difference of 10% between @xmath10 @xcite and the on - shell scheme @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that although two - loop corrections to the cross section may seem to be small , it is much harder to estimate their scale and behaviour for such a complicated observable as the parity - violating asymmetry to be measured by moller experiment .",
    "the two - loop ewc to the born ( @xmath11 ) cross section can be divided into two classes : the q - part induced by quadratic one - loop amplitudes ( @xmath12 ) , and the t - part corresponding to the interference of the born and two - loop diagrams ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to calculate the q - part exactly .",
    "we show that the q - part is much higher than the planned experimental uncertainty of moller , which means that the two - loop ewc may be larger that previously thought .",
    "the large size of the q - part demands a detailed and consistent consideration of the t - part , and that will be the next task of our group .",
    "let us start by writing the cross section of polarized mller scattering with the born kinematics shown in fig .",
    "[ born ] , @xmath14 such that , with the appropriate accuracy for the present paper , we find : @xmath15 here , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the scattering angle of the detected electron with 4-momentum @xmath18 in the center - of - mass system of the initial electrons .",
    "the 4-momenta of initial ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) and final ( @xmath18 and @xmath21 ) electrons generate a standard set of mandelstam variables : @xmath22 it should also be noted that the electron mass @xmath23 is disregarded wherever possible , in particular if @xmath24 .",

    "let us describe the structure of @xmath25 : @xmath29 where the @xmath30-channel upper and lower electron leg currents are @xmath31    the squared born amplitude @xmath25 forms the born cross section : @xmath32 . \\label{cs0}\\ ] ]    a handy structure to use in the present study is @xmath33 which depends on the @xmath34-boson mass @xmath35 or on the photon mass @xmath36 .",
    "the photon mass is set to zero everywhere with the exception of specially - indicated cases where the photon mass is taken to be an infinitesimal parameter that regularizes the infrared divergence ( ird ) .",
    "another set of useful functions is @xmath37 these are combinations of coupling constants and @xmath38 , where @xmath38 are the degrees of polarization of electrons with 4-momentum @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "more specifically , @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 the subscripts @xmath42 and @xmath43 on the cross sections correspond to @xmath38 = @xmath44 and @xmath38 = @xmath45 , where the first subscript indicates the degree of polarization for the 4-momentum @xmath19 and the second one indicates the degree of polarization for the 4-momentum @xmath20 .",

    "the question of the dependence of ewc on renormalization schemes and renormalization conditions ( within the same scheme ) was addressed in our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "the infrared - finite bse term can easily be expressed as : @xmath51 with @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the transverse part of the renormalized photon , @xmath34-boson and @xmath54 self - energies .",
    "the longitudinal parts of the boson self - energy make contributions that are proportional to @xmath55 ; therefore they are very small and are not considered here .    in order to get the electron vertex amplitude ( 2nd and 3rd diagrams in fig .",
    "[ 2f ] ) , we use the form factors @xmath56 in the manner of paper @xcite , replacing the coupling constants @xmath57 with form factors @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "then , @xmath60 where the electron currents with vertices look like @xmath61 the infrared singularity is regularized by giving photon a small mass @xmath62 and in the @xmath30-channel vertex amplitude can be extracted in the form : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the base of the natural logarithm .",
    "the rest ( infrared - finite ) part of @xmath30-channel vertex amplitude has the simple form the remaining ( infrared - finite ) part of the @xmath30-channel vertex amplitude has a simple form convenient for analysis and coding : @xmath65    the box term can be presented as a sum of all two - boson contributions : @xmath66 we need to account for both direct and crossed @xmath67 , @xmath54 and @xmath68-boxes : @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 given by exact expressions in 4-dimensional integral form ( 4-point functions ) by @xmath72 @xmath73 obviously , for @xmath74-boxes we only need the crossed expression ( [ cr ] ) .",
    "the infrared parts of the @xmath67- and @xmath54-boxes in the @xmath30-channel are similarly given by @xmath75 using asymptotic methods , we can significantly simplify the box amplitudes containing at least one heavy boson ( see , for example , @xcite , where simplifications were done on the cross - section level )",

    "now we should make sure that the infrared divergences are cancelled . in a similar way",

    "the term @xmath87 ( see ( [ 01 ] ) ) is called the q - part of the two - loop ewc and is the main subject of the present paper .    if we substitute the amplitudes derived in section ii to the left - hand - side of ( [ 01 ] ) , and compare the result with the right - hand side of this equation , we will get the same expression for @xmath90 as given in @xcite . the simplest form for @xmath91",

    "the cross section induced by the emission of two soft photons with a total energy less then @xmath99 can be written as : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a statistical factor caused by the indistinguishability of two final photons and @xmath112 .",

    "( see @xcite ) is in excellent agreement with the result from @xcite if we use the same set of standard model parameters .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , the scale of the q - part contribution in the low - energy region is approximately constant , but grows sharply at @xmath160 , where the weak contribution becomes comparable to the electromagnetic .",
    "this increasing importance of the two - loop contribution at higher energies may have a significant effect on the asymmetry measured at future @xmath161-colliders .    cc    ( 60,60 ) ( -112,-60 )",
    "experimental investigation of mller scattering is not only one of the oldest tools of modern physics , but also a powerful probe of new physics effects . the new ultra - precise measurement of the weak mixing angle via 11 gev mller scattering planned at jlab ( moller )  as well as experiments proposed at future high - energy electron colliders  will require that the higher - order effects to be taken into account with the highest precision possible .",
    "in this work , we build on the study of the one - loop electroweak radiative corrections to the cross - section asymmetry of the polarized mller scattering at 11 gev initiated by our group in @xcite , and address some of the two - loop effects . at this stage",
    ", we perform a detailed calculation for the part of the two - loop electroweak radiative correction induced by squaring one - loop diagrams .",
    "the two - loop ewc to the born ( @xmath11 ) cross section is divided into the t - part , which is the interference of born and two - loop diagrams ( @xmath13 ) , and the q - part , induced by quadratic one - loop amplitudes ( @xmath12 ) , which we evaluate here .",
    "the results are presented in both numerical and analytical form , with the infrared divergence explicitly cancelled .",
    "also , we clearly demonstrate the important role of the imaginary part of amplitude , which is consistently taken into consideration both in the infrared - finite and divergent terms .    as one can see from our numerical data , at the moller kinematic conditions , the part of the nnlo ewc we considered in this work can increase the asymmetry by up to @xmath162% .",
    "the corrections depend quite significantly on the energy and scattering angles ; at the high - energy region of @xmath163  gev achievable in the planned experimental program of the ilc , the estimated contribution of the quadratic ewc can reach + 14% ; for 3 tev at clic , it would be + 42% .",
    "we see that the large size of the q - part demands detailed and consistent consideration of the t - part , which will be the next task of our group .",
    "it is impossible to say at this time if the q - part will be partially enhanced or cancelled by other two - loop radiative corrections , although it seems probable that the two - loop ewc may be larger than previously thought .",
    "although an argument can be made that the two - loop corrections are suppressed by a factor of @xmath164 relative to the one - loop corrections ( see @xcite , for example ) , we are reluctant to conclude that they can be dismissed , especially in the light of 2% uncertainty to the asymmetry promised by moller .",
    "since the problem of ewc for the mller scattering asymmetry is rather involved , a tuned step - by - step comparison between different calculation approaches is essential .",
    "one of the important results of this work is the correctness of our calculations , which was controlled by a comparison of the results obtained from the equations derived by hand with the numerical data obtained by a semi - automatic approach based on feynarts , formcalc , looptools and form .",
    "these base languages have already been successfully employed in similar projects ( @xcite , @xcite ) , so we are highly confident in their reliability .    in the future , we plan to address the remaining two - loop electroweak corrections which may be required by the promised experimental precision of the moller experiment and experiments planned at ilc .",
