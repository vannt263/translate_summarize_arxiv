    "practical devices based on coherent quantum mechanical properties are widely seen as being one of the next major advances in electronics .",
    "this search is typified by the keen interest in quantum computation @xcite . in this paper , however , we seek first to explore a slightly different aspect of coherent quantum devices , by investigating how coherence can be used to enhance the capabilities of an otherwise incoherent electronic device .",
    "we will then consider extensions where quantum information , rather than classical information , is transported around a quantum dot system .",
    "we consider how to utilize coherent charge transfer in an incoherent device , i.e. one where the initial and final states of the device are eigenstates of the system hamiltonian , but intermediate states are formed by coherent superposition states .",
    "applications which might benefit by such coherent charge transfer could be single electron pumps @xcite or electronic digital logic ( for example through quantum - dot cellular automata ( qdca ) @xcite ) , but our ideas are general and should have wide applicability . by exploring this regime",
    "we seek to increase our understanding of quantum coherence and exploit coherent effects before the technical difficulties of building truly global coherent quantum devices have been solved . as such one may even consider our proposal as realising a limiting case of a type - ii quantum computer @xcite where there is enough coherence to effect a single gate operation ( a swap gate ) but not enough coherence to maintain any superpositions after the initial transfer is completed .    mechanisms of coherent population transfer can be broadly classified into two classes , nonadiabatic and adiabatic .",
    "nonadiabatic methods are usually typified by control of tunnelling to realize @xmath0 or similar pulses , which transfer population from one state to another coherently and rapidly .",
    "nonadiabatic processes require exacting control over pulse areas and tunnelling rates that are fast compared with all relevant dephasing times . although nonadiabatic population transfer is a goal , the sensitivity to noise of nonadiabatic transfer can place prohibitive requirements on pulse switching times in certain implementations .",

    "such methods are usually slow and are accompanied by high fidelity and relative insensitivity to gate errors and other external noise . between these regimes",

    "there are reasonably few proposals for adiabatic passage without using electro - magnetic radiation in the literature , although brandes and vorrath consider adiabatic passage through a double - dot system @xcite ; barrett and milburn considered using adiabatic passage as a method for determining dephasing rates in a qubit @xcite ; and more recently zhang _ et al .",

    "we propose adiabatic passage through a triple - well system .",

    "independantly , eckert _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have considered the realization of an analogous stirap style scheme with a neutral atom in a triple well potential formed in an optical trap .",
    "such schemes are more complicated than two - state adiabatic fast passage , but have the advantage that the electron energy is unchanged throughout the population transfer .",
    "this consideration is important when considering the trade - off between heat dissipation and gate speed in qdca @xcite , and our scheme could be used to realise true adiabatic clocking of a qdca , as opposed to the quasi - adiabatic clocking schemes reported recently @xcite . maintaining constant energy is also important for preventing an extra dynamical phase appearing when quantum information is being transported , as will be discussed below .",

    "so one must perform a transfer slow enough to be adiabatic , but fast enough to not be decohered .",
    "although these values for @xmath62 may appear small compared with optical systems , one should realise that in stirap we are comparing the transfer times with the _ two - photon _ decoherence of the two ground states , which is normally very much longer than the decoherence rates of the optical transitions . in our case",
    "we have assumed that the action of the environment is to decohere all superposition states equally as a pure dephasing process .",
    "pure dephasing is known to limit the performance of charge qubits and is manifested by electrostatic interactions with background charge fluctuators and phonon interactions @xcite .",
    "because ctap is a _ coherent _ transfer method , there will be no heat dissipated by the electron during the transfer , and because the initial and final states are ground states , there can be no heat dissipation after transfer either .",
    "therefore , provided the transfer is fast relative to the decoherence time , there will be no heat dissipation _ regardless of the transfer speed_. this should be contrasted with the quasi - adiabatic result for qdca switching where there is a necessary tradeoff between switching time and heat dissipation @xcite .",
