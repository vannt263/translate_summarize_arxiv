    "accurate pulsar distance measurements are useful for many reasons .",
    "combined with dispersion measures , they probe the electron content along different lines of sight through the local galaxy .",
    "combined with proper motions , they constrain the pulsar velocity distribution and hence the symmetry of supernova explosions . combined with radio , optical , x ray , and uv flux measurements ,",
    "they determine the absolute luminosities and radiation efficiencies of pulsars . for a thermally emitting neutron star",
    ", they even promise the possibility of directly constraining the neutron star radius and hence the nuclear equation of state at high densities .",
    "there are many different ways of estimating pulsar distances , including association with supernova remnants or globular clusters at known distance , or the use of a model of the electron distribution in the galaxy together with dispersion measurements .",
    "but the most fundamental method  indeed , the only model - independent method  remains the measurement of parallaxes .",
    "pulsar parallax measurements are difficult .",
    "even the closest pulsars are 100  pc or more distant ; thus parallax leads to an apparent annual motion of 10  mas or ( typically ) much less . with their steep spectra ,",
    "pulsars are usually observable only in the low - frequency radio band , where the ionosphere introduces substantial temporally- and geographically - variable shifts in the phase of the signal , making precision interferometry particularly challenging .    before the completion of the very long baseline array ( vlba ) ,",
    "only six interferometric pulsar parallaxes were published ( table  [ tab : early ] ) .",
    "it is important to understand the very great difficulties these observers faced .",
    "first , in many cases they were limited to rather short baselines ( @xmath2  km ) and decimeter and longer wavelengths ( @xmath3  cm ) .",
    "the ionosphere and the small array size limited the potential accuracy to about 1  milliarcsecond ( mas ) , unless a very nearby calibrator source was used .",
    "some serendipitous measurements were possible .",
    "for example , the measurement of the parallax of pulsar b1451@xmath468 was about ten times more precise than the ionosphere would ordinarily have allowed with the available array because of the fortuitous presence of a calibrator only @xmath5 from the pulsar , within the same primary telescope beam .",
    "a second problem for early observers was the limited number of telescopes available in early , ad hoc vlbi networks . with only three or fewer stations ,",
    "it is very difficult to fully resolve `` phase - wrap '' ambiguities to determine which of a family of possible positions on the sky is actually occupied by the source . as shown in brisken _",
    "_ ( 2000 ) , an incorrect choice of phase wraps could lead to parallax errors much larger than the formal measurement errors .",
    "( by the time the last measurement in table  [ tab : early ] was made  the parallax of b2021 + 51a number of vlba stations was available .",
    "although the observations used a different set of telescopes at each observing epoch , and large baseline errors in the telescope positions had still not been resolved , it is notable that this early result is within @xmath6 of our new measurement . )",
    "it is probably not coincidental that every repeated pulsar parallax measurement has yielded a smaller parallax ( and greater pulsar distance ) .",
    "we suspect that the expectation of larger results in early experiments probably contributed to incorrect lobe choices .",
    "with the ten - station vlba this is no longer a problem .",
    "although we will not further discuss non - radio measurements here , for completeness we note that the high - energy pulsar geminga ( j0633 + 1746 ) has a three - epoch parallax measured by hst of @xmath7  mas ( caraveo et al . , 1996 ) , and the radio quiet neutron star j185635@xmath43754 has an hst - derived parallax of @xmath8 mas ( walter , 2001 ) .",

    "our successful measurement ( brisken et al . 2000 ) of the parallax of psr  b0950 + 08 , using a new calibration technique to remove the disruptive effects of the ionosphere from the interferometry data , prompted us to expand our program of parallax measurements to a larger sample .",
    "we had two primary goals .",
    "one was the immediate desire to increase the number of pulsars with well - measured distances .",
    "but a second goal was to improve our understanding of the new calibration technique , to test its limitations , and to measure the level of residual systematic errors .",
    "for this reason , our target selection was not yet optimized solely to produce an unbiased pulsar sample for statistical work on pulsar distances . instead , we chose nine pulsars at a variety of declinations , of varying flux densities , and with varying pulsar - calibrator angular separations .",
    "we also continued our observations of psr  b0950 + 08 , to produce an extremely over - constrained data set for studies of our errors .",
    "an important constraint on target selection was the need for a high flux density at 1400  mhz . based on our experience with b0950 + 08",
    ", we expected that we would be able to successfully do an ionospheric correction for pulsars with flux densities above about 10  mjy at 1400  mhz .",
    "we also preferentially targeted pulsars with estimated distances ( from the dispersion model ) of less than about 2  kpc . for this experiment , we only considered candidate pulsars whose nearest vlba calibrator source was no more than @xmath17 from the pulsar .",
    "larger separations lead to larger differential ionospheric and tropospheric effects , and will be more difficult to calibrate .",
    "the @xmath17 limit was set after experiments in which we attempted to calibrate psr  b0950 + 08 against the international celestial reference frame calibrator source 1004 + 141 , at a separation of @xmath18 . at this separation",
    "the differential propagation effects were too large to correct using the new calibration technique .",
    "we also rejected pulsars at declinations below @xmath19 , where high elevation ( @xmath20 ) observations can not be made simultaneously at all vlba stations .",

    "five epochs of observations for each pulsar were planned over the course of one year , enough to redundantly determine the proper motion and parallax even with a failed epoch . to maximize our sensitivity to the angular signature of parallax ,",

    "this non - detection is most likely because of the extreme , long - term scintillation modulation that affects the signal from this pulsar .",
    "it was dropped from the program , and the time allotted to other pulsars was increased slightly .",
    "about ninety minutes of on - source integration was obtained for each pulsar at each epoch .    in order to make relative position measurements ,",
    "each pulsar observation was interleaved with observations of a vlba calibrator source with position known to better than 15  mas .",
    "the antennas nodded back and forth between the pulsar and calibrator with a cycle time of about five minutes .",

    "were observed in a cycle , integrating for 100 seconds on the pulsar and 60 seconds on each calibrator .",
    "all observations were made with the ten - station nrao vlba .",
    "the 20  cm band ( 1400 to 1740  mhz ) was chosen as a compromise between falling flux densities and increasing resolution as frequency increases .",
    "this band also offers the wide fractional bandwidths needed for the ionosphere calibration .",
    "the 338  mhz wide band available from the receivers was nyquist sampled in eight 8  mhz spectral windows beginning at 1404 , 1414 , 1434 , 1474 , 1634 , 1694 , 1724 and 1734  mhz .",
    "pulsar gating was employed to increase the signal - to - noise of the pulsar measurements by disabling correlation during off - pulse .",
    "the gate gain listed in table [ tab : pulsars ] is the expected signal - to - noise increase factor based on the pulse profiles measured at 1400  mhz .",
    "the timing data needed to construct the pulse arrival time ephemerides was collected by andrew lyne at jodrell bank .",
    "data reduction was performed with the aips software package .",
    "phase - referencing ( shapiro et al . 1979 ) was used to relate the pulsar s position to that of its calibrator .",
    "corrections for the structure of the calibrator source were made .",
    "the absolute position shift caused by structure is less than 1  mas for most vlba calibrators .",
    "epoch - to - epoch position shift caused by differences in the baseline coverage is a smaller effect but is more important for relative astrometry .",
    "phase - referencing cancels out most of the pulsar s phase errors such as those due to clock and baseline offsets and bulk propagation effects ; however , propagation effects that are path - dependent are not exactly cancelled and dominate the remaining phase errors . at 20  cm ,",
    "the largest of these effects is due to the ionosphere .",
    "a technique for removing the effect of the ionosphere without independent calibration information was described by brisken et al .",
    "it is briefly described here .",
    "the phase shift at frequency @xmath53 due to a free electron column density of @xmath54 is @xmath55 the wet troposphere also causes phase shifts , but with a non - dispersive dependence on @xmath53 , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the column density of water in the atmosphere .",
    "only the differential phase shifts at two antennas enter into the visibility phases .",
    "after phase - referencing , only the difference in visibility phase shifts due to propagation between the pulsar and calibrator remain .",
    "while the absolute phase shifts may be several thousand degrees , only the double - differences of their values are relevant to the position measurements . for the troposphere",
    ", we find that this amount is typically less than @xmath58 of phase for calibrator - target separations of up to @xmath17 at 20  cm .",
    "in contrast , the differential ionosphere can be up to @xmath59 on long baselines .",
    "in addition to the unwanted phase shifts due to propagation effects , the geometric phase associated with the position of the pulsar ( the quantity that is to be determined ) also contributes to the pulsar s visibility phase .",
    "the point - like nature of pulsars simplifies the geometric phase to @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the pulsar s offset from the correlation center in radians , @xmath62 is the speed of light , and @xmath63 are the components of the projected baseline perpendicular to the direction to the pulsar .",
    "the phase delays due to geometry and the troposphere are both independent of frequency ( non - dispersive ) , making their disentanglement impossible for a given visibility .",
    "visibility measurements spanning a large range of elevations can be used to separate out the troposphere , but this was not done due to the limited elevation ranges that we used .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to measure the differential ionosphere strength with multi - frequency data since the ionosphere s phase delay is frequency dependent ( dispersive ) .",
    "the visibility phase on a single baseline can be expressed as @xmath64 where @xmath65 incorporates all of the non - dispersive components ( the geometry and the troposphere ) , @xmath66 is the strength of the differential ionosphere , and the integer @xmath67 is the number of additional phase wraps . once @xmath66 is known , the distorting effects due to the ionosphere can be removed from the visibility .",
    "station - based ionosphere solutions were determined by fitting station - based phases to eqn  [ eqn : fit ] .",
    "the station - based phases at each frequency band were determined by fitting the measured phases to a point source model representing the pulsar with solution intervals shorter than the amount of time that the ionospheric phase shift changes by about @xmath68 ( about 20 or 30  seconds at 20  cm ) .",
    "solution intervals of 10  seconds or less were used on the brightest pulsars .",
    "since all phases are relative , one station was chosen to be the reference antenna and was assigned zero phase .",
    "unknown phase wraps complicate the fitting for @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this is because certain combinations of the @xmath65 and @xmath66 parameters closely mimic an additional undetectable phase wrap due to the limited spanned bandwidth as is shown in figure  [ fig : ambig ] .",
    "the fitting was performed first on the southwestern antennas ( fort davis , tx , kitt peak , az , los alamos , nm , and pie town , nm ) where baselines are shorter and thus the geometric phases are smaller and the differential propagation effects are also less .",
    "an image was made without any ionosphere calibration to determine the pulsar s position to better than 10  mas .",
    "the pulsar s approximate position was used to reduce the unknown non - dispersive phase to less than @xmath69 . since the tropospheric phase is usually less than @xmath58 , the number of phase shifts , @xmath67 , can be determined and the ionosphere can be calibrated away for the southwestern antennas .",
    "the phase shifts associated with the fitted @xmath66 parameters were removed from the visibility data . an image made with the ionosphere calibrated southwestern antennas yielded pulsar positions to better than 1  mas , allowing ionosphere solutions to be found at and applied to the remaining stations .",
    "differential ionosphere strengths , converted to their effect on visibility phases at 1400  mhz , are shown as a function of time on all baselines to kitt peak , the reference antenna for this observation , in figures [ fig : ionoshort ] , [ fig : ionomed ] , and [ fig : ionolong ] .",
    "the phase differences on the four shortest baselines shown ( kp to fd , la , ov , or pt ) all have rms values less than 1 radian , and are centered close to zero phase .",
    "the longer baselines often show large systematic offsets from zero phase .",
    "see for example the br  kp and kp  mk baselines . without correction a displacement of the pulsar from its true sky location results .",
    "the data in these figures is from the 1999 november 16 , observations of psr  b1929 + 10 .",
    "the sun was 68@xmath70 from the pulsar during this observation .",
    "sunset occurred at saint croix during the observation and is probably responsible for the rapid change in ionospheric phase delay near the end of the observation on the kp  sc baseline . observations made when the pulsar and sun are on opposite sides of the earth show considerably smaller ionospheric phase delays but still exhibit fluctuations on the 10  minute timescale .",
    "b1929 + 10 is separated from its calibrator by @xmath28 .",
    "final pulsar images were made once the ionosphere calibration was completed .",
    "a separate image was made for each 8  mhz band .",
    "the position of the pulsar was measured by fitting a gaussian ellipse to the pulsar image .",
    "data from a single 8  mhz spectral window produced images of the pulsar with signal - to - noise of about 40 .",
    "the dominant source of the image noise was phase scatter due to the troposphere , making the final signal - to - noise ratio almost independent of the pulsar s strength .",
    "in most cases the position agreement between images made at two different frequencies was better than 0.1  mas .",
    "a misalignment of more than this amount prompted a detailed inspection of the calibration process and usually resulted in stricter elevation limits or the removal of a frequency band with severe radio frequency interference .",
    "once image alignment was achieved , a final image was made incorporating the data from all useful frequency bands .",
    "the final position measurement was made from this image .",
    "the synthesized beam sizes for the final images were about 10  mas north  south and 4  mas east  west but varied slightly depending on source declination .",
    "we model the path of the pulsar in terms of its position at epoch 2000.0 ( @xmath71 ) , proper motion ( @xmath72 ) , and parallax ( @xmath73 ) by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is time since year 2000.0 .",
    "the functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the parallax displacements in right ascension and declination , respectively , for an object at a distance of 1  pc as a function of the time of year .",
    "the five parameters are determined by minimizing the @xmath78 function associated with the above model using an iterative linear inversion .",
    "uncertainties in the fit parameters were based on the single - epoch position uncertainties .",

    "the distances to the pulsars derived from their parallax measurement are shown in comparison with their dispersion measure ( dm ) derived distances in table  [ tab : derived ] .",
    "the uncertainties in dm distance are obtained by assigning the dm a gaussian probability distribution function ( pdf ) centered on the measured dm with a 40% variance .",
    "the dm pdf provides a way to account for the uncertainty in the dispersion model ; it is not meant to reflect uncertainty in the the dispersion measures as the dms of the pulsars studied in this sample are measured to better than 1% . since the dispersion model is not smooth ,",
    "a non - gaussian distance pdf is obtained when the dispersion model is applied to the gaussian dm pdf .",
    "the most probable distance is quoted along with errors bracketing the most compact 68% likelihood region .",
    "b1237 + 25 has a very high @xmath79 upper limit because of is to its position high above the galactic plane ( @xmath80 pc ) .",

    "the proximity of an in - beam calibrator to the pulsar ( @xmath83 ) , and their simultaneous observation , reduce the amount of uncalibrated ionosphere and troposphere .",
    "further , gps data was used to model and remove most of the remaining differential ionosphere .",
    "single epoch uncertainties as low as 0.2  mas were attained in this manner .",

    "a more accurate distance of @xmath85 was inferred for this pulsar by monitoring the decrease in its binary period , @xmath86 . by assuming that general relativity accurately predicts the orbital decay of this close neutron star binary via emission of gravitational radiation , the other contributions to @xmath86 from the motion of the system restricts its possible distance .",
