    "the periodic anderson model ( pam ) is one of the basic models describing strongly correlated systems whose characteristics fit to be interpreted in a two - band picture @xcite . the model is largely applied in the study of heavy - fermion systems @xcite , intermediate - valence compounds @xcite , or even high critical temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "in contrast however with other models used in the understanding of phenomena created by strong correlation effects , where at least in one dimension exact solutions exist ( for example the hubbard model @xcite ) , the physics described by pam is almost exclusively interpreted based on approximations .",
    "this is due to the fact that only few results are exactly known about the behavior of pam .",
    "indeed , what we know about the physical behavior of pam in rigorous terms can be summarized as follows : the first results , related to the ground - state of decorated hyper - cubic lattices in the limit of infinite interaction strength has been provided by brandt and giesekus @xcite followed by a non - magnetic ground - state restricted to 1d and on - site repulsion @xmath1 case obtained by strack @xcite . this solution has been extended to @xmath2 as well , at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "again for infinite on - site hubbard repulsion has been demonstrated that at quarter filling the ground - state is unique with a defined total spin @xcite .",
    "it has been also underlined that the model becomes solvable in the case of constant and infinite range hopping @xcite .",
    "we further know , that for only on - site hybridization and without direct hopping in the correlated band : the symmetric half - filled case is spin - singlet @xcite and in 1d also pseudo - spin singlet @xcite , at half filling anti - ferromagnetic correlations are present @xcite , and in 1d,2d long - range order of ferro , anti - ferro and pairing type is absent @xcite .",
    "recently have been published the first exact ground - states at finite @xmath3 in 1d @xcite and 2d @xcite , respectively . concerning 2d , the reported ground - states @xcite",
    "require next to nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) one - particle terms as well in the hamiltonian ( @xmath4 ) , and from the obtained solutions , especially the physical properties of the itinerant one has been described in detail .",
    "the deduction of exact ground - states in @xmath0 dimensions is of large interest in general , and for strongly correlated systems in special . in the case of pam , at finite and nonzero value of the interaction , the only one procedure doable",
    "working at the moment in this respect , is based on plaquette operators introduced in ref.@xcite , and a decomposition of the on - site hubbard interaction as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . during this procedure",
    ", @xmath4 is such transformed to contain in a positive semidefinite form products of plaquette operators . since in 2d",
    "the product of plaquette operators generates nnn one - particle terms as well , the general impression created by the method suggests that the applicability of the procedure is intimately connected to nnn contributions in 2d , and the deduced exact ground - states are fingerprints of this fact .    in this paper , presenting for the first time exact ground - states for pam in 2d at finite value of the interaction , in restricted regions of the parameter space and without nnn type of extension terms in @xmath4 , we demostrate that the plaquette operator procedure and the ground - states deduced with it are not necessarily connected to the presence of nnn extensions in @xmath4 . in order to clarify these aspects ( i ) the plaquette operator technique is analysed in detail in general terms and 2d , ( ii ) a completely new type of plaquette operator is introduced which allows the deduction of the presented results , ( iii ) the obtained new localized exact ground - state is analyzed and described in detail , and ( iv ) implications of the results relating the metal - insulator transition in frame of pam are presented .",
    "the deduced new ground - state is a completely localized state . in order to characterize this phase , after obtaining the exact ground - state , all relevant ground - state expectation values and correlation functions",
    "have been exactly calculated and analyzed .",
    "the obtained state is paramagnetic , and based on a coherent control which it has on the occupation number of all lattice sites , it introduces long - range density - density correlations into the system , producing a localized state .    concerning implications to physical systems , we mention the intense activity in the field related to the understanding of the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in frame of pam .",
    "the subject has an almost 30 years of history @xcite , and gained renewed interest in the last period based on the observed mit similarities between the hubbard model and pam , used for example in the understanding of the iso - structural electronically driven mit transitions ( like the @xmath5 transition in @xmath6 compounds ) @xcite .",
    "since the exactly deduced ground - state energy values presented in this paper are not containing exponential factors characteristique to kondo type of behavior , the results reported here underline that at least in some regions of the parameter space , a localization - delocalization transition in frame of pam is not necessarily connected to kondo physics .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is structurated as follows : section ii .",
    "presents the hamiltonian we use , section iii . describes the plaquette operator technique , section iv . presents the transformation of the starting hamiltonian into a new expression containing plaquette operators ,",
    "section v. describes the detected new exact ground - states , section vi . concludes the paper , and appendices a.- d. containing the mathematical details of the starting points of the paper close the presentation .",
    "we start with a generic pam hamiltonian written for 2d square lattice as @xmath7 where , the contributing terms in order , are representing the kinetic energy of @xmath8 electrons ( @xmath9 ) , the kinetic energy of @xmath10 electrons ( @xmath11 ) , the on - site @xmath10 electron energy ( @xmath12 ) , the hybridization ( @xmath13 ) , and the on - site hubbard interaction written for @xmath10 electrons @xmath14 , the last contribution representing the interaction term , and @xmath15 being considered during this paper .",
    "the presence of @xmath11 in @xmath4 is motivated by the overwhelming evidence , that the heavy - fermion materials contain in their real band structure around the fermi level ( @xmath16 ) very narrow , hybridized bands , which exist already at temperatures far above the thermodynamically determined kondo temperature , being relatively @xmath17 independent and holding an accentuate @xmath10 character @xcite .    the interaction term during this paper is exactly transformed in the form @xmath18 where , the positive semidefinite operator @xmath19 defined by eq.([e9 ] ) requires for its lowest zero eigenvalue at least one @xmath10 electron on every lattice site @xcite . as will be clarified in section v.",
    ", the representation presented in eq.([e9 ] ) is a key feature from the point of view of the interaction term in the process of the deduction of exact ground - states in the frame presented here .",
    "the hybridization @xmath13 is considered to be build up from a local @xmath20 , and a nonlocal @xmath21 contribution , @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the local one - particle terms of the hamiltonian are @xmath12 and @xmath20 whose expressions become @xmath23 the non - local one - particle contributions remain to be presented . in order to make the notations clear , instead of the site - numbering notation ( i ) we use here the @xmath24 vectorial notation for the lattice sites .",
    "the kinetic energy contribution @xmath25 thus is given by @xmath26 and the non - local hybridization becomes @xmath27 the notation of the non - local hybridization matrix elements by the superscripts @xmath28 and @xmath29 is given by mathematical convenience , and through the paper @xmath30 will be considered .",
    "we note that at the level of one - particle contributions , @xmath4 , and as a consequence @xmath31 and @xmath21 , contain at the start all contributions entering in an elementary plaquette ( unit cell for the system ) @xcite . in these circumstances , for both eqs.([e11],[e12 ] ) , it is important that @xmath32 to be rigorously defined .",
    "this is because ( i ) we would like to represent different contributions correctly in term of plaquette operators , and ( ii ) we must avoid multiple counting of different terms entering in the expression of @xmath4 .",
    "for this reason , we mention that for a given lattice site , taking into account nearest neighbor ( nn ) and nnn contributions as well ( these will be present in an elementary plaquette ) , 8 hopping possibilities exist . from these ,",
    "only 4 are taken into account explicitly by @xmath33 , and , the remaining 4 contributions are introduced into the hamiltonian by the @xmath34 operation . in these conditions ,",
    "the defined 4 different @xmath32 contributions entering in @xmath33 are @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the lattice constant , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , are the versors of the @xmath39 , @xmath40 axis , respectively .",
    "the hopping and hybridization matrix elements generated by the contributions from eq.([e14 ] ) are represented for clarity in fig . 1 . also for clarity , the explicit expressions of @xmath31 and @xmath21 from eqs.([e11],[e12 ] )",
    "are presented in appendix .",
    "a.    in the case of concrete materials , the nnn one - particle contributions are small , and as a consequence are often neglected .",
    "furthermore , it is important to know in rigorous terms if nnn contributions are introducing small corrections into the results or are able to provide qualitatively new effects . in the case of pam , which is in a relatively early stage of its exact description , this issue must be also clarified .",
    "because of this reason , during this paper , even if we start with nnn terms in @xmath4 for technical reasons , we try to obtain exact ground - state solutions for pam in the absence of nnn contributions as well .",
    "this task is also enhanced by the aim to extend the potential possibilities of the plaquette operator procedure we use .",
    "starting from these motivations , we are reporting in this paper for the first time exact ground - states for pam in 2d at finite and nonzero @xmath3 , in the absence of nnn extension terms in @xmath4 .    in order to be able to obtain exact ground - states in @xmath41 dimensions for the pam hamiltonian presented in eq.([e8 ] ) , we use a plaquette operator procedure which will be described in details in the following section .",
    "concerning the method itself , in our knowledge , it is used now for the second time ( see also @xcite ) , and other methods in obtaining exact ground - states for pam in @xmath41 dimensions are not known at the moment . in principle , the procedure can be applied for other model hamiltonians as well containing itinerant degrees of freedom .",
    "the technique needs the transformation of @xmath4 in a positive semidefinite expression based on plaquette operators . in 2d ,",
    "the plaquette operators ( as block operator units used for description ) generate local , nn and nnn terms as well .",
    "this suggests that also the studied 2d hamiltonian must contain such type of contributions .",
    "if this would be the case , the application possibility of the procedure in 2d would be strongly limited to hamiltonians that contain nnn extension terms as well .",
    "we demonstrate in this paper that this impression is not correct , and the procedure can be extended and applied even in the absence of nnn contributions in @xmath4 .",
    "we further mention that for hamiltonians containing main long range terms ( next to nnn or higher range contributions ) , the block unit used for description must be enlarged .",
    "let us consider a 2d finite @xmath42 square lattice , with lattice constant @xmath36 . in order to identify the lattice sites",
    ", we are numbering them by @xmath43 starting from the left - down corner , taking into account first the lowest row , and inside a row counting from left to right ( we mention that for a vectorial position notation we are going to use @xmath24 instead of i , when this is necessary ) . for example , in the simple case of @xmath44 , we obtain the lattice site numbering presented in fig .",
    "2 . as can be seen in this figure ,",
    "we are denoting by @xmath45 the elementary plaquettes . using this notation , we start from the lowest elementary plaquette row , counting from left to right inside a row , and then going upward with the notation .    taking periodic boundary conditions into account in both directions ,",
    "the number of plaquettes becomes equal to the number of lattice sites @xmath46 . in this case , it is advantageous to denote every plaquette @xmath45 by its down - left corner @xmath47 , as @xmath48 .",
    "concerning the notation of a plaquette through its down - left corner , for clarity we mention that for example , in fig .",
    "2 . , the plaquette @xmath49 defined by the lattice sites @xmath50 becomes @xmath51 , or , the plaquette @xmath52 , defined by the lattice sites @xmath53 becomes @xmath54 , etc .    let us now consider for pedagogical reasons , some @xmath55 fermionic operators creating particles on lattice sites within the system .",
    "in general , the @xmath56 operators can be labelled also by a supplementary @xmath57 index which contains all relevant quantum numbers as well ( in the case of pam , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the spin , and @xmath60 the type of particle ) . in this section , being interested in the presentation of the method , we are neglecting the @xmath57 index for simplicity .",
    "if the reader understands how the procedure works , the presented relations can be easily generalized for @xmath61 as well .    using the @xmath56 operators ,",
    "plaquette operators can be constructed by a linear combination of @xmath56 acting on the corners of an elementary plaquette .",
    "we are denoting the coefficients of this linear combination by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 denotes the plaquette , @xmath43 labels a given corner of the plaquette @xmath63 analyzed , and @xmath64 denotes the type of operator considered ( this becomes the @xmath57 index when @xmath65 is used instead of @xmath56 ) , respectively .",
    "for example , in case of the plaquettes @xmath66 and @xmath67 from fig . 3a .",
    "we obtain @xmath68 working with plaquettes , we must observe that all one - particle contributions of a given hamiltonian can be obtained starting from plaquette operators .",
    "for example , let us consider the hopping matrix element connecting the nearest - neighbor lattice sites @xmath69 from fig .",
    "3a , namely @xmath70 .",
    "this hamiltonian contribution can be obtained for example , from the expression @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath72 where , the operator @xmath73 concentrates all the other terms obtained from the left side of eq.([e2 ] ) .",
    "the operator @xmath73 will not be neglected in our considerations .",
    "it contains 30 terms that can be easily calculated from eq.([e1 ] ) ( see also appendix b. ) .",
    "the important aspect here , which must be keeped in mind , is that @xmath73 do not contains contributions entering in @xmath74 .",
    "otherwise , the concrete expression of @xmath73 is not important at the moment .",
    "the relation from eq.([e2 ] ) is obtained since , @xmath75 gives rise to @xmath76 , and @xmath77 creates the term @xmath78 , respectively . because the bond @xmath79 is not present in other elementary plaquettes , even if we take into consideration all the plaquettes from the whole lattice in a sum of the form @xmath80 , the hopping matrix element @xmath81 becomes unambiguously expressed as @xmath82 the obtained eq.([e3 ] ) shows that the hamiltonian parameters ( at least the one - particle once in the present case ) , can be expressed in term of plaquette operator parameters if we succeed to express the corresponding hamiltonian terms into a sum of the form @xmath80 .",
    "similarly , the next - nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude for the @xmath83 hopping from the plaquette @xmath66 of fig . 3a . , contained in the hamiltonian term @xmath84 becomes @xmath85 in eq.([e3a ] ) only the plaquette operator product @xmath86 contributes , because , the nnn hopping described by @xmath87 is contained only in the plaquette @xmath66 .",
    "these examples illustrate that plaquette operators can be extremely useful in the study of different model hamiltonians @xmath4 , since as seen from eq.([e2 ] ) , different emerging contributions in @xmath4 can be represented in diagonal , or positive semidefinite form via the operators @xmath88 . as can be observed from eqs.([e3],[e3a ] ) , a such type of representation in term of plaquette operators , from the point of view of @xmath4 parameters , simply means a parametrization in term of plaquette operator coefficients @xmath62 .",
    "for this to be possible , the plaquette operator products summed up over lattice sites of the form @xmath80 ( i ) must generate terms present in @xmath4 , or ( ii ) must generate terms that are constants of motion ( for example total number of particles , or lattice sites ) , or ( iii ) must generate terms that can be cancelled out if the ( i ) and ( ii ) conditions can not be applied .",
    "we will return back to this problem after presenting the new plaquette operators defined in this paper ( see after eq.([e7 ] ) ) , and the following section exemplifies in detail a such type of transformation .",
    "when the one - particle @xmath4 parameters are not local ( for example @xmath89 for all vertical nearest - neighbor hoppings ) , which means @xmath90 the parameters @xmath62 of different plaquette operators are not independent . in the case of translational invariant hamiltonians , we can chose for example translational invariant plaquette operator parameters as illustrated by fig .",
    "3b . denoting the sites inside a given plaquette starting from the down - left corner and counting anti - clockwise , the corners of the plaquette @xmath66 ( and @xmath67 ) in fig.3b . , will be denoted by @xmath91 ( and @xmath92 ) , respectively .",
    "given by the considered translational invariance of plaquette operators , the plaquette operator parameters of the plaquettes @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath93 equal indices will have the same value @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "this property is extended as well to all plaquettes .",
    "in the examples contained in fig . 3b . , the plaquette operators @xmath96 , @xmath97 become in this case @xmath98 from eqs.([e3],[e4],[e5 ] ) , the unique nn hopping matrix element in @xmath99 direction of @xmath64 particles , based on eq.([e3 ] ) becomes @xmath100 and , from eqs.([e3a],[e5 ] ) , the unique nnn hopping of the same particles along the main diagonal of every elementary plaquette will be described by @xmath101 similarly , all one - particle hamiltonian matrix elements can be expressed in term of plaquette operator parameters .",
    "when the so obtained equations ( as eqs.([e6],[e6a ] ) ) allow solutions for the plaquette operator parameters ( this is possible usually in a restricted parameter space region @xmath102 determined by the values of @xmath4 parameters ) , the one - particle part of the hamiltonian can be expressed via @xmath103 ( see eq.([e2 ] ) ) .",
    "based on these relations and using for example properties related to positive semidefinite operators , the hamiltonian of the system can be diagonalized exactly , at least for the ground - state , inside @xmath102 .    after testing this method in 1d @xcite ( using bonds instead of plaquettes )",
    ", a such type of procedure has been recently used by us @xcite in order to provide the first exact ground - state wave - functions for the periodic anderson model in 2d in restricted regions of the parameter space .",
    "this has been done by choosing @xmath104 for @xmath105 electrons with @xmath106 @xmath107 in pam , and defining based on this choice , the @xmath108 spin - dependent plaquette operators containing spin - independent @xmath109 parameters with @xmath60 , @xmath110 as follows ( the example is taken for the plaquette @xmath66 of fig . 3b . ) @xmath111    the obtained ground - state solutions based on eq.([e6b ] ) were connected to @xmath112 filling @xcite , and are highly non - trivial states .",
    "one of them is a completely localized state , and the second one is itinerant , with the momentum distribution function for the half - filled upper diagonalized band as shown in fig .",
    "4 , presenting a clear evidence of ( exactly deduced ) non - fermi liquid behavior in normal phase and @xmath0 spatial dimensions .",
    "this shows that the procedure detects ground - states which are far to be trivial .",
    "however , the inconvenience of the plaquette operator from eq.([e6b ] ) is that via @xmath113 it creates nnn terms , these must be present in @xmath4 as well , so the deduced ground - states , and the procedure itself , seem to be related to the presence of nnn extensions in the hamiltonian .",
    "we present below how this inconvenience can be removed .",
    "for this reason , we must observe , that the choice of the operators @xmath56 in eq.([e5 ] ) and the form of the plaquette operator itself is not fixed a @xmath114 .",
    "this means that the possibility presented in eq.([e6b ] ) for the plaquette operators is not unique , even if we are interested in the study of a fixed model ( as pam in the present case ) . as a consequence",
    ", we can chose other possible forms for the plaquette operators , and using them , we can deduce other ground - states in other regions of the @xmath115 phase diagram of the model . to exemplify this statement , in the present paper we define for the decomposition of the studied pam hamiltonian in translational invariant case , a completely new type of plaquette operators @xmath116 and",
    "each of these has different plaquette operator parameters @xmath118 and @xmath119 , @xmath110 , @xmath60 , @xmath120 .",
    "furthermore , both plaquette operators @xmath116 and @xmath117 are containing both spin components with different numerical prefactors , i.e. @xmath118 , @xmath119 are considered independent , and @xmath121 dependent . exemplifying the new form for the case of the plaquette @xmath66 of fig . 3b . , where @xmath24 denotes the vectorial position of the site @xmath122 , the new @xmath116 operator is defined as @xmath123 similar expression is used for the @xmath117 operator as well for the same plaquette @xmath66 , in which , the plaquette operator parameters are considered @xmath119 , instead of @xmath124 .",
    "note the plaquette independent values of the @xmath118 and @xmath119 parameters , which , as explained in this section , is given by the translational invariance of the considered system .    comparing eq.([e6b ] ) and eq.([e7 ] ) , we realize that the @xmath108 plaquette operators for both @xmath125 values have 8 independent @xmath109 parameters , while in the present case , for both @xmath126 , @xmath127 operators , the number of independent plaquette operator parameters is 32 .",
    "this enlargement of the number of parameters give us the possibility to demonstrate that the described procedure is able to detect also ground - states whose presence do not require the nnn terms in @xmath4 of the system , even if the @xmath128 products are providing such type of terms at the start .",
    "the key feature for this to work is the presence of two plaquette operators @xmath88 and @xmath129 containing different spin - dependent coefficients .",
    "indeed , in this case , by @xmath130 we can cancel out not only the @xmath131 terms created by @xmath132 which are not present in @xmath4 ( these would represent for example hopping terms containing spin - flip ) , but also the nnn terms generated by @xmath80 . because of this reason becomes to be possible to obtain the expression of a hamiltonian not containing nnn contributions in term of plaquette operator products which create such type of elements .",
    "the concrete transformation of the hamiltonian is presented in the following section .",
    "comparing the expression of the hamiltonian presented in the previous section together with the explicitations contained in appendices a. and b. , eqs .",
    "( [ e10],[a1],[a2],[b1 ] ) , we realize that the following relation holds @xmath133 \\sum_{\\bf i}^{n_{\\lambda } } \\hat d^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf i},\\sigma } \\hat d_{{\\bf i } , \\sigma } + \\sum_{\\sigma } [ \\sum_{n=1}^4(|a_{n , f,\\sigma}|^2 + |b_{n , f,\\sigma}|^2 ) ] \\sum_{\\bf i}^{n_{\\lambda } } \\hat f^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf i},\\sigma } \\hat f_{{\\bf i } , \\sigma } \\ : , \\label{e15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if , the hopping and hybridization matrix elements are related to the parameters of the plaquette operators @xmath116 and @xmath117 via @xmath134 where the non - linear system of equations from eq.([e16 ] ) is presented explicitly in the appendix . c. , and @xmath135 .",
    "these equations arise as eqs.([e6],[e6a ] ) in section i. the system of equations eq.([e16 ] ) must be considered as containing known @xmath4 parameters ( @xmath136 ) , and unknown plaquette operator numerical prefactors ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "in fact , a simple ( but lengthy ) algebraic calculation shows that eq.([e15 ] ) exactly holds if the relations between the parameters of @xmath4 and the numerical prefactors of the plaquette operators , presented explicitly in appendix c , are satisfied .",
    "the number of equations contained in eq.([e16 ] ) is @xmath138 , and the 32 unknown complex plaquette operator parameters provides 64 unknown variables ( the real and imaginary parts ) .",
    "these are entering in eq.([e16 ] ) in a nonlinear , but complex - algebraic manner . since the number of equations is higher that the number of unknown variables , solutions will be allowed only if some inter - dependences ( fixed by eq.([e16 ] ) ) will be present between the @xmath4 parameters .",
    "these relations contribute in the definition of @xmath139 ( see also the observations below eq .",
    "( [ e24 ] ) ) .",
    "we underline that since the structure of plaquette operators used in this paper ( see eq.([e7 ] ) ) is completely different from the structure of the plaquette operators from eq.([e6b ] ) ( in that case , instead of eq.([e16 ] ) , we have 17 equations presented in eq.(9 ) of ref.@xcite , containing 16 unknown variables ) , the problem set up here , from mathematical point of view , is completely different from that analysed in our previous work .",
    "we also note that as can be seen from appendix b , @xmath140 introduces @xmath141 like terms as well , which are missing from the hamiltonian .",
    "because of this reason we need a second plaquette operator product @xmath142 , whose role is exactly to cancel out these supplementary terms not present in @xmath4 , eq.([e8 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the presence of @xmath143 allows also to cancel out the nnn terms created by @xmath144 . via eq.([e15 ] ) , this give as the possibility to express @xmath4 through @xmath145 even in the absence of nnn terms in the hamiltonian , and to obtain ground - state wave - functions in this case as well .",
    "using now eqs.([e9],[e10 ] ) , we have @xmath146 where , the positive semidefinite operator @xmath147 has been defined in sec.ii . adding eq.([e17 ] ) to eq.([e15 ] ) and using for the plaquette operators the anti - commutation property presented in eq.([b2 ] ) , we find @xmath148 where , the introduced constants are defined by @xmath149 , with @xmath60 . imposing the relations @xmath150 the expression of @xmath4 from eq.([e19 ] ) becomes @xmath151 since we are working at fixed number of particles @xmath152 , from eq.([e21 ] ) we obtain @xmath153 where @xmath154 for @xmath15 is a positive semidefinite operator defined by @xmath155 and the number @xmath156 is given by @xmath157 the transformation of eq.([e8 ] ) into eq.([e22 ] ) is possible only if the system of equations eqs.([e16],[e20 ] ) allows solutions for the plaquette operator parameters .",
    "the presence of these solutions will be possible only on restricted domains @xmath102 of the parameter space of the problem given by the inter - dependences between the @xmath4 parameters mentioned below eq.([e16 ] ) . as a consequence , the solutions that will be presented below are valid only in this @xmath102 region .",
    "in this section we are presenting first the derivation of the exact ground - states , then we discuss the possible solutions for the plaquette operator parameters , and finally , we analyse in extreme details the solution obtained for zero nnn contributions .      starting from eq.([e22 ] ) , taking into account that @xmath154 is a positive semidefinite operator , we realize that the ground - state of @xmath158 is the wave function @xmath159 , for which @xmath160 .",
    "to find @xmath159 , we have to keep in mind eq.([e23 ] ) which defines @xmath154 . given by @xmath161 we observe that the plaquette operator part of eq.([e23 ] ) applied to @xmath162 gives zero .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath147 requires for its zero ( and minimum ) eigenvalue at least one @xmath10-electron on every lattice site , we add to the ground - state the contribution @xmath163 , where @xmath164 are arbitrary coefficients . as a consequence ,",
    "the ground - state with the property @xmath160 becomes @xmath165 |0 \\rangle \\ : , \\label{e26}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath166 is the bare vacuum with no fermions present . the product in eq.([e26 ] ) must be taken over all lattice sites .",
    "because of this reason , the product of the creation operators in eq.([e26 ] ) introduces @xmath167 particles within the system , so the deduced ground - state wave - function corresponds to @xmath112 filling .",
    "all degeneration possibilities of the ground - state are contained in eq.([e26 ] ) , since the wave function with the property @xmath168 at @xmath112 filling always can be written in the presented @xmath159 form .",

    "this process can be tuned by pressure which strongly influences the @xmath255 parameters ( see for example ref.(@xcite ) ) . since the reduction of eq.([e26 ] ) into the completely localised @xmath208 from eq.([e32 ] ) it is itself based on a delicate balance between @xmath4 parameters ( contained in eqs.([e30 ] ) ) , the loss of the localization character of particles in principle can be easily achieved .",
    "this localization - delocalization transition represents in fact a mit transition provided by pam . since the exactly deduced ground - state energy do",
    "not contains the exponential term characteristic for a kondo type behavior ( see for example the discussion presented in ref.(@xcite ) ) , a such type of mit transition can not be connected to kondo physics .",
