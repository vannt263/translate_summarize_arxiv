    "<S> the parton distributions functions ( pdfs ) derived from the nnlo qcd analysis of existing light - targets deep - inelastic - scattering data are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo and nnlo pdfs are compared in order to analyze perturbative stability of the analysis and estimate impact of the higher - order qcd corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the main theoretical uncertainties and experimental uncertainties in pdfs due to all sources of experimental errors in data are estimated and used to assess corresponding uncertainties in the cross sections of other hadronic processes .    </S>",
    "<S> a study of the hard processes in the hadron collisions requires knowledge of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pdfs determine the normalization of the cross sections and therefore very often the uncertainty in the pdfs puts limit on the precision of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason the estimation of the pdfs uncertainties and improvement of our knowledge of the pdfs was the scope of intensive studies in recent years  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> estimation of the different uncertainties in pdfs shows that the uncertainties in the ansatz of analysis ( theoretical ones ) dominate over the uncertainties propagated from the experimental errors in data used to constrain the pdfs ( experimental ones ) for wide kinematics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the potentially dangerous theoretical uncertainty in the pdfs extracted in the nlo qcd comes from the higher orders ( nnlo ) corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the nnlo corrections are unknown for the most of hard processes , but have been almost completely known for the dis with calculation of the splitting function moments up to the 12-th  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining uncertainty in the dis structure functions due to missing terms in the nnlo correction was estimated at the level of few percent for the realistic kinematics  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 cm    the approximate nnlo corrections of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite were applied in the qcd analysis of the existing charged - leptons dis data including data from the slac , bcdms , nmc , h1 , and zeus experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nnlo and the nlo gluon distributions obtained in this analysis ( a02 ) are compared in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> variation of the gluon distribution under account of the nnlo correction is generally within the experimental errors that indicates perturbative stability of nnlo pdfs . in the same plot </S>",
    "<S> we give the nnlo gluon distribution extracted from the mrst global fit of  ref.@xcite . at low @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> the mrst gluon distribution is well below the a02 one and gets negative at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this difference has not been clarified entirely . </S>",
    "<S> one of the possible reasons is certain inconsistency of the nnlo mrst fit due to the nnlo corrections have been applied for the dis only , while the mrst fit includes the drell - yan ( dy ) and the jet production data as well . </S>",
    "<S> this inconsistency was explicitly demonstrated in study of impact of the nnlo correction on the dy cross sections  @xcite : the nlo dy cross sections calculated using mrst pdfs are in good agreement with experimental data , while the nnlo predictions are well above the data . </S>",
    "<S> note for the jet data used in the mrst analysis the nnlo corrections are presumably even more important than for the dy process . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for the nnlo pdfs extracted from the dis data the higher - order qcd theoretical errors are under much better control than for pdfs from the global fits .    the nnlo qcd predictions for the structure function @xmath2 based on the different sets of pdfs are compared to the h1 measurements of ref.@xcite in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> the mrst predictions are everywhere below the data . </S>",
    "<S> since for the kinematics of fig.2 @xmath2 is defined mainly by the gluon distribution this might mean that the mrst underscore the gluon distribution at small @xmath3 and @xmath0 . for the a02 prediction agreement with the data </S>",
    "<S> is much better . at @xmath1 the agreement </S>",
    "<S> is achieved mainly due to the leading - twist ( lt ) term , which was calculated using the nnlo pdfs . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath4 the main contribution comes from the high - twist ( ht ) term in @xmath2 , which was fitted in the a02 analysis simultaneously with the leading - twist term . </S>",
    "<S> this ht term might be manifestation of a new phenomena expected at small @xmath3 or can be caused by the conventional effects like missing resummation of large logs or , eventually , by a disagreement of data from separate experiments used in the combined fit . in any case </S>",
    "<S> the unusual behavior of @xmath2 at small @xmath3 and @xmath0 must stimulate more precise measurements in this region .    </S>",
    "<S> 1.7 cm    with a good control of theoretical errors the nnlo pdfs extracted from the inclusive dis data provide good tool for the precision measurements on the hadron colliders . </S>",
    "<S> the nnlo predictions for the @xmath5 cross sections obtained using the code of ref.@xcite with the a02 pdfs are compared to the experimental data in fig.3 . </S>",
    "<S> the prediction error bands given in fig.3 includes both theoretical and experimental errors in pdfs . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of predictions is much better than the errors in data , which are mostly due to uncertainty in the luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore these prediction combined with the measurements of the @xmath5 rates can be used for better monitoring of the rates of other processes including exotic ones . </S>"
