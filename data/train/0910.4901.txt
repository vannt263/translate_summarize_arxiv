    "high quality transmission of multimedia signals over wireless channels is an important research problem from both theoretical and practical aspects .",
    "while the rich content of multimedia signals requires transmission at high data rates , the unreliable nature of the wireless medium due to fading makes it hard to sustain these high rates at all times .",
    "an appropriate performance measure for these applications is the average end - to - end signal distortion , which will be caused by both the compression of the continuous amplitude source samples and the errors over the channel .    here , we consider the transmission of a discrete - time gaussian source over a block fading multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channel .",
    "we assume that the instantaneous channel state information ( csi ) is available at the receiver . motivated by real - time applications , we consider a strict delay constraint such that @xmath1 source samples are to be transmitted within a single channel block of @xmath2 channel uses .",
    "we define the _ bandwidth ratio _ of the system as @xmath3 channel uses per source sample , and analyze the system performance with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in the high @xmath5 behavior of the average distortion , @xmath6 , which is characterized by the _ distortion exponent _ @xcite : @xmath7    in addition to the direct channel , we assume that there is a feedback link available from the receiver to the transmitter , which can transmit @xmath0 bit per channel use ( bpcu ) without error or delay . the effect of feedback on the performance of mimo channels has been the subject of considerable research . in the block",
    "fading scenario that we consider , the feedback link of a finite number of bits per channel block can be used to transmit the channel state information to the transmitter @xcite , to ask for additional parity bits in an automatic repeat request ( arq ) system @xcite , or to delay the transmission until channel conditions improve @xcite . in our model",
    ", we strictly constrain the transmission to a single block , and power allocation among blocks is not possible due to the short - term power constraint .",
    "our main result is a characterization of the distortion exponent for all bandwidth ratios and an arbitrary number of transmit and receive antennas in the presence of @xmath0 bpcu feedback . in the optimal transmission scheme ,",
    "source samples are compressed into @xmath8 successive refinement source layers .",
    "these layers are channel coded at different rates to provide unequal error protection against channel fading , and are transmitted progressively over the channel .",
    "the feedback link is used to inform the transmitter about the success of decoding of the source layer that is being transmitted .",
    "as soon as an ack signal is received from the receiver , the transmitter starts transmitting the channel codeword corresponding to the next source layer .",
    "this transmission strategy can be considered as an instantaneous arq scheme .",
    "arq feedback is widely used in wireless networks to improve the reliability of the system ; however , it is an important open research problem whether the arq scheme is the best way to make use of the finite rate feedback resources .",
    "the answer , in general , depends on the performance measure and the operating regime . here ,",
    "under an extreme model of instantaneous arq feedback , we prove its optimality in terms of the end - to - end distortion exponent .",
    "the characterization of the distortion exponent for fading channels has recently been investigated in several studies .",
    "the distortion exponent is first defined in @xcite .",
    "the achievable distortion exponent in the case of mimo channels is studied in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that , by using a successive refinement source encoder and superposition coding over the channel @xcite , the optimal distortion exponent can be achieved in systems with one degree - of - freedom at all bandwidth ratios . however , the optimality of this scheme is limited to high bandwidth ratios in the case of general mimo systems . while bhattad et al .",
    "@xcite extended the optimality of this scheme to a larger set of bandwidth ratios using a different power allocation strategy , the characterization of the distortion exponent at all bandwidth ratios remains open .",
    "these results show that , at least in certain scenarios , successive refinement source coding concatenated with superposition channel coding can adapt to the channel fading optimally as it achieves the distortion exponent upper bound obtained by assuming perfect channel state information at the transmitter . the transmission algorithms proposed in @xcite",
    "are studied in the finite @xmath5 regime in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our result in this paper shows that the availability of the 1 bpcu feedback link provides adaptation to the channel state independent of the number of degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "we note here that the feedback link does not improve the diversity multiplexing tradeoff ( dmt ) performance under the short - term power constraint since the dmt analysis does not allow rate adaptation .",
    "source transmission over a block - fading mimo channel with feedback is also studied in @xcite , in which the authors consider finite bit feedback in the form of quantized channel state information .",
    "a hybrid digital - analog coding scheme is proposed in @xcite , which uses the feedback information to assign the rate of the digital component , and improves the distortion exponent even with a feedback link of a single bit per channel block .",

    "the achievability scheme in the proof of theorem [ t : fdbk_ach ] in section [ s : proof ] uses successive refinement source coding followed by progressive transmission of the layers over the channel .",
    "each channel codeword is transmitted until an ack signal is received from the receiver over the feedback link . in the absence of a feedback link ,",
    "progressive transmission of layers was considered in @xcite with optimal but fixed allocation of the channel block among the layers .",
