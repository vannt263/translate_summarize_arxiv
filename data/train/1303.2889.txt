    "it is very well known that the biggest problem in the quest to find the origin of cr is the presence of magnetic fields in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the fields have both regular and irregular components and both play a role in causing the cr to travel by torturous paths . the irregular component , which dominates , causes the cr to effectively diffuse from their sources .",
    "the present work comprises a quick survey of the results on cr anisotropies which , hopefully , have relevance to the origin problem , together with the necessary information about the mode of transport of the cr , specifically the regular and irregular field properties .",
    "particular emphasis is given to the new data at sub - pev and pev energies which appeared since our latest paper on this subject @xcite .",
    "a particular quest is to see if there is evidence favouring our single source model ( ssm ) (  see @xcite and later papers  ) , in which a particular supernova remnant ( snr ) (  presumed to be the monogem ring  ) is the main cause of the sharp knee in the cr energy spectrum at about 3 - 4 pev .",
    "according to our model a change in anisotropy and phase might be expected at energies approaching 1 pev .",
    "a similar scenario has been invoked by sveshnikova et al .",
    "( 2011 ) @xcite in terms of one or more local snr being responsible for some , at least , of the fine structure of cr energy spectra and the form of the declination ( @xmath1 ) versus right ascention ( @xmath2 ) plots . also included in the analysis is a study of the anisotropy of the lower energy cr , i.e. from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is in gev .",
    "in principle , the cr intensity will be a complicated function of galactic longitude and latitude ( @xmath6 ) or , equivalently , right ascention and declination ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is customary , and reasonable , however , to represent it by two components .",
    "the first is in terms of a simple flow - with a near - sinusoidal intensity variation , in a fixed declination band (  insofar as the detectors sweep out a band of constant declination  ) .",
    "this gives the anisotropy amplitude @xmath8 , and the phase in @xmath2 .",
    "the second is the residual excess , or excesses , which remain after the first harmonic has been subtracted .    when only a limited declination range is available , the measured value of @xmath8 has to be corrected to allow for the fact that the declination at which the cr maximum is detected is not necessarily the centre of the declination range available for study .",
    "this point was made by kiraly et al .",
    "( 1979 ) @xcite and very recently by lidvansky et al .",
    "( 2012 ) @xcite .    even in the past ,",
    "when only measurements of the counting rate (  as , for example , with neutron monitors  ) were used for the study of anisotropy , or the arrival directions of cr particles were measured with a large uncertainty (  muon telescopes  ) , it was noted that the use of just the first harmonic was not enough to get a good fit of the cr spatial variation .",
    "the use of two harmonics improves the fit , but it means that the spatial distribution of the cr intensity has a rather complicated structure . nowadays , when the arrival directions of the cr particles are measured with good accuracy , the constructed two - dimensional maps of the cr intensity have confirmed the complicated structure of the cr sky and allowed its analysis on different angular scales .",
    "figure 1 shows a summary of the estimates of amplitude and phase derived from a number of previous summaries , specifically @xcite (  to be referred to as ew1  ) .",
    "this new summary includes the latest data from super - kamiokande @xcite , milagro @xcite , argo - ybj @xcite , icecube @xcite and icetop @xcite , as well as updated data from eas - top @xcite , which were not shown in our previous summary ew1 .",
    "the errors of the amplitudes and phases of these latest works are shown as they are given by the authors , except for icetop , about which we shall comment later .",
    "the icecube measurements cover the energy range from tens to hundreds of tev @xcite .",
    "the distribution of primary energies responsible for the production of the detected tev muons is rather wide .",
    "the median energies for two selected energy bands are 0.02 and 0.4 pev .",
    "it can be remarked that in this energy range the amplitude of the first harmonic falls down from @xmath9 to @xmath10 and the phase changes from @xmath11 degrees to @xmath12 degrees .",
    "the icetop measurements cover the range of higher energies @xcite .",
    "the median values rise from 0.4 pev to 2 pev and at the lower energy band they overlap with icecube data giving the possibility to make a comparison between two independent experiments carried out at the same location at the south pole and covering the same primary energies . however , a direct comparison of the published results is not possible .",
    "the icetop collaboration prefers to fit their intensity profile by the superposition of a flat background and a gaussian dip . in order to make the comparison with icecube and other works we fitted the icetop profile with the traditional two - harmonic function .",
    "the result of the best fit for both 0.4 pev and 2 pev energy domains is given in table 1 and shown in figure 1 for the first harmonic .",
    "table 1 + anisotropy amplitude and phase for two energy domains in icetop    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 2 .",
    "numerical values of the parameters used , as an example , in the calculations shown in fig.2 .",
    "it is seen that even for such a reasonable set of parameters shown in table 2 and for the total number of particles in the disc and the halo it is impossible to reach a 20-fold excess of halo over the disc .",
    "if we take into account the large volume of the halo (  in figure 2 it was assumed the cylindrical shape of the halo with the tenfold increase of the vertical scale height  ) then the contribution of the ggh to the cr _ intensity _",
    "(  not the number of particles  ) at pev energies will be only 10 - 20% .",
    "the wind can not amplify the contribution of the halo and reduce the amplitude of the anisotropy .",
    "the amplitude of the anisotropy @xmath8 is connected with the characteristics of the cr density @xmath13 , its gradient @xmath14 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath15 as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the speed of light . in our propagation model @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the vertical scale height of the disc , which we assumed to be 1kpc and @xmath20 is defined above as the lifetime of the cr particles in the disc .",
    "therefore , @xmath21    this expression shows that there is a unique relationship between the mean cr lifetime @xmath20 and the anisotropy @xmath8 .",
    "figure 3 shows the lifetime implied by our model (  which has @xmath22y with @xmath5 in gev  ) as given in figure 1a with @xmath23 .",
    "elsewhere , we have made predictions of the energy spectra using @xmath24 @xcite and others , eg @xcite have made calculations for the same value of @xmath24 .",
    "figure 3 shows three variants of the standard model .",
    "also shown , as ns , is the mean lifetime versus energy needed to give a best smooth line going through the experimental points in figure 1a .",
    "it is seen that a dramatic flattening is needed above about loge , gev = 3 .",
    "in fact , when allowance is made for a modest halo @xcite and downward fluctuations at the 10% probability level , @xmath25 would suffice .",
    "consequences of the non - standard ( ns ) model are considered in some detail in the appendix , but some general remarks are given here .",
    "it has long been known that @xmath26 is needed for @xmath27 gev / nucleon in order to explain the secondary to primary ratio ( s / p ) as a function of energy @xcite . at higher energies smaller values of @xmath1 (  0.3 to 0.5  )",
    "have been commonplace . indeed , in our own work @xcite involving anomalous diffusion values in the range @xmath28 were considered .",
    "there is thus a precedent for considering small values of @xmath1 .",
    "figure 4 shows the anisotropy amplitude loga vs loge for 10 samples of the snr space - time distributions calculated with the non - standard ( ns ) lifetime of cr protons shown in figure 3 .",
    "it is seen that the rise of the amplitude with the energy seen in figure 1a changed to a nearly constant value at rather low absolute level .",
    "the change of the gradient @xmath29 expected with the change of the diffusion coefficient does not compensate the reduction of the amplitude due to the change of the lifetime .",
    "again , there is a reassuring consistency of the phases from the different experiments (  figure 1b  ) .",
    "a slow change of phase is indicated , from a phase of @xmath30 at loge , gev = 2 to about zero at loge , gev = 5 .    as might be expected , at low energies where the local conditions of ism are relevant",
    ", the experiments indicate a more complicated anisotropy pattern than a simple first harmonic and this aspect is taken up in the next section .",
    "the variation of the cr flux with the right ascension is better not analysed in terms of the simplified one - dimensional picture with the phase , often integrated over a large range of declinations .",
    "rather one should examine the two - dimensional maps , provided by the publications , which often show a more complicated picture with a few excesses in different parts of the sky at different ra and @xmath1 .",
    "we are mindful of the potential criticisms of andreev et al .",
    ", 2008 @xcite who criticise the validity of two - dimensional maps .",
    "nevertheless , we continue to use the results of the experimenters themselves .",
    "figure 5 shows a schematic view of the location of cr excesses in both equatorial and galactic coordinates for the 5 new experiments , which published these maps : milagro .",
    "argo - ybj , super - kamiokande , icecube and icetop .",
    "positions of cr excesses observed in these experiments often split and overlap and we decided to give very schematic presentation of these excesses just to illustrate the location of the excesses in the cr sky .",
    "contours of the ellipses in figure 5 embrace very approximately the areas of excesses exceeding the mean background by three standard deviations .",
    "the upper half of figure 5 , panels ( a ) and ( b ) show maps in equatorial coordinates , the lower half , panels ( c ) and ( d ) show the same maps in galactic coordinates .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( c ) show the excesses observed in the lower , 6 - 20 tev energy domain .",
    "the overlap of the milagro , argo - ybj and super - kamiokande gives a measure of confidence for these measurements and confirms the puzzling conclusion made in @xcite that in spite of the fact that the bulk of snr , pulsars and other potential cr sources are in the inner galaxy surrounding the galactic centre , the excess of cr is observed in the opposite , anti - centre direction . the new point in these measurements",
    "is actually connected with the fact that milagro and argo - ybj collaborations observe two excesses in the same direction of the anti - centre , but both in the northern and in the southern galactic hemisphere .",
    "this gives an argument in favour of the conclusion that the cr at tev energies originate in sources whose directions span a large range of galactic latitudes .",
    "the measurements of icecube at the higher energy of @xmath020 tev show that presumably the excess region shifts in the direction of the third and fourth quadrants .",
    "it would be expected that at tens of tev energies the giroradius of particles in the typical magnetic fields of a few microgauss should be very small , @xmath00.01pc .",
    "the diffusion of particles is thus strongly dependent on very local phenomena : the direction of the local regular magnetic field component , modulated by the random field and the near - absence of a gradient of the cr density .",
    "the latter is determined by the influence of the local fluff and the spiral orion arm which are located in the direction of the outer galaxy and can overcome the influence of the background cr flux from the sources in the inner galaxy @xcite .",
    "the local fluff is a well known and important feature of the local ism (  see reference @xcite for the original reference ; much later work has confirmed the identification  ) .",
    "it is of about 10 pc extent and can clearly affect the propagation of low energy cr , i.e. those of scattering length of this order and less . the effect will be significant in view of the fact that there will be transit time and , thereby , intensity differences from nearby sources depending on direction",
    ".    inspection of figures 1b and 5a , c shows that the value of @xmath31 is close to that expected for an excess of cr intensity from along the @xmath32-direction over the local @xmath32-direction , the best fit being with the very local @xmath32-direction but the uncertainty in the actual values ( typically @xmath33 ) , and the likely effect of local field irregularities make the discrepancy understandable .",
    "another important aspect is the gradient of the cr energy density that would be expected in the absence of regular field effects .",
    "the near constancy of amplitude and phase indicates that the true anisotropy ( i.e. that which would occur in the absence of a regular field component ) is very small .",
    "the direction to the galactic anti - centre from which the excess of cr arrive , as has been already remarked , is presumably due to factors connected with the small galactocentric gradient of cr emissivity @xcite . in that work",
    "it was suggested that shear in the ism in the relatively undisturbed parts of the outer galaxy ism was responsible for the ( near- ) lack of gradient .",
    "this would be in addition to the random nature of the snr sources .",
    "a further factor is that the reentrant pev particle from the ggh will , themselves , have a small anisotropy from the general direction of the galactic centre .",
    "figure 1 and panels ( b , d ) of figure 5 show results of anisotropy measurements at the relatively high energies of about 400 - 2000 tev .",
    "they were made by two independent detectors : icecube and icetop at the south pole .",
    "it is seen that the amplitude of the anisotropy , after falling down to the minimum at several hundred tev , started to rise again above @xmath0400 tev , exceeding the value of @xmath34 in the pev region .",
    "the phase of the first harmonic dropped by nearly @xmath35 .",
    "an inspection of the two - dimensional map shows that the results of two measurements at the comparable energy of 400 tev partly overlap , giving support to each other .",
    "the excesses observed at this energy occupy the region close to galactic disc in the fourth quadrant . at the highest energy of 2000 tev icetop experiment observed that the excess moved to the direction",
    "still closer to the galactic centre , but shifted to higher southern galactic latitudes .    at pev energies the scattering length approaches 100pc and",
    "it would be expected that the influence of the local environment would become smaller and more distant regions of the galaxy enter the scene . at larger distances from the solar system",
    "the higher density of sources in the inner galaxy overcomes the influence of the local environment and the cr excess moves toward the direction of the galactic centre .",
    "however , the existence of the knee and other fine structures in the cr energy spectrum give evidence that non - uniformity in the space - time distribution of sources still reveals itself at pev energies and above .",
    "figure 5 shows the positions for the potential sources : the monogem ring snr and vela x pulsar with its pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the latter is young and can be a potential source if the particles can escape from the snr associated with them .",
    "it is seen that both sources are in the outer galaxy and close to the galactic disc .",
    "the monogem ring snr is nearby one of the excess regions indicated by milagro and argo - ybj at lower 6 - 20 tev energies .",
    "it is not far from the direction towards the anti - centre and can in principle contribute to this excess .",
    "counterargument that the excess area does not cover the position of the monogem ring snr centre can be overcome by the fact that this snr has a rather large size with a ring diameter of about @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "so we can not reject the possible contribution of the monogem ring snr to the anisotropy at energies below 0.1 pev on the basis of just anisotropy arguments . on the other hand ,",
    "if the monogem ring is responsible for the knee and has rather flat energy spectrum , its contribution at energies below 0.1 pev is negligible .",
    "another worry is that this snr can not be associated so far with any excess at the higher 400 - 2000 pev energies , although it has to be remarked that all the indicated measurements in panel ( b ) of the figure 5 have been made at the south pole and do not cover the positive declinations where the monogem ring is situated .",
    "vela x can in principle have relevance to the formation of the excess observed by the icecube experiment in both energy domains .",
    "however , it is not in the direction of the galactic centre , but just close to the border between the third and fourth quadrants .    as for its characteristics as the potential cr source , not only is there the problem of particle escape from the encompassing snr but the time window for emission of particles of adequate energy is not clear .",
    "this lack of clarity arises because of uncertainty about the pulsar s period at birth @xmath37 , its past rate of energy loss and the efficiency for cr acceleration .",
    "a literature survey yields a range of @xmath37 : 18 to near 89ms .",
    "for most of the range , however , there should be an adequate window for pev particles to be generated and the diffusion time from pulsar to the earth is acceptable .",
    "the remaining questions relate to cr efficiency and particle escape .",
    "since the anisotropy is very small the work in this field is difficult because it requires high statistical accuracy .",
    "that is why the experimental data on the anisotropy at sub - pev and pev energies are rather poor .",
    "the kascade experiment did not find any anisotropy @xcite and we give their upper limits in this and our previous paper @xcite .",
    "updated eas - top data give only the amplitude and phase of the first harmonic @xcite and not two - dimensional maps of the excesses in the cr flux .",
    "we used their data in our figure 1 .",
    "in addition to our earlier work on the single source others have contributed to the development of the idea .",
    "mention has already been made ( in  1 ) of the work of sveshnikova et al .",
    "@xcite in which both known and simulated nearby snr were considered .",
    "the dip in figure 1a was not reproduced .",
    "vela x was discounted because of the wrong phases above @xmath38 = 5 appear not to have been included",
    ". nevertheless , the work mentioned adds to the attention given to the role of the anisotropy as well as cr energy spectrum in defining a ( possible ) single source .",
    "other workers who have developed our stochastic source distribution model include @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the idea of a non - standard model was not mentioned , however .",
    "mention should also be made of very recent work @xcite .",
    "the authors have claimed that heliospheric effect may be responsible for part at least of the anisotropy to energies as high as 100 tev .",
    "this is a remarkable result insofar as heliospheric effects are usually considered to be small by 1 tev .",
    "confirmation , or otherwise , is awaited . in any event , our conclusions , and those of others , should not be affected beyond @xmath39 where the case for the effect of a single nearby source is made .",
    "up to @xmath40 there is consistency in the measurements of large scale ( first harmonic ) anisotropies and near constancy of phase : an important result enabling detailed analysis to be worthwhile .",
    "transport along the local magnetic field lines seems a likely cause although the direction of flow - from the general direction of the galactic anti - centre - is surprising .",
    "the random space - time configuration of cr sources with the contribution of a few sources such as the monogem ring and vela x snr can play a role in the formation of the excess cr flux from the general direction of the galactic anti - centre .",
    "a giant galactic halo is inadequate to account for the comparatively small measured anisotropy .",
    "another discrepancy to be explained is the lack of convexity in loga vs loge plot in our conventional model. instead , a new model is invoked : a non - standard propagation model .",
    "its acceptance , or otherwise , awaits further analysis .    contunuing with low energies (  @xmath41  ) , there is no obvious rapid change of the anisotropy with loge , as yet .",
    "the new component , claimed by us @xcite from observations of the detailed spectral shapes of many elements might be expected to give a change of anisotropy amplitude / phase at 100 gev .",
    "unfortunately , this is just the lower limit for our study , and , in any event , solar modulation causes distortions below about 100 gev .",
    "there are no features in the energy range loge , gev : 2 to 5 which can be attributed to fine structure (  although there is an interesting hint of a decadal periodicity of phases with respect to loge  ) .    at higher energies",
    "there is evidence for a change in anisotropy amplitude and phase , although the experimental data are , as yet , rather sparse and cover mostly the area of negative declinations .",
    "they indicate that the amplitude of the first harmonic begins to rise with the energy and the phase changes to the opposite .",
    "the cr flux excess in galactic coordinates shifts to the fourth quadrant and at the highest pev energies to the direction of the galactic centre .",
    "an explanation in terms of the onset of a significant contribution from the sources in the inner galaxy and some of the local sources is promising .",
    "although the monogem ring snr is still possible , vela x is a distinct possibility if its birth period were short enough ( @xmath42ms ) and the particles were able to penetrate the surrounding vela snr envelope .",
    "it is shown in figure 3 that the form of the @xmath43 vs loge dependence is non - standard , in the sense that it is not simple power law , in contrast with the usual assumption .",
    "in fact , as remarked already , the assumption of a unique , energy independent form of @xmath1 is simplistic : propagation of cr through the ism is , no doubt , a process of great complexity .    in @xcite varying degrees of turbulence were considered , giving rise , in turn , to varying degrees of anomalous diffusion ( ad ) .",
    "our adopted form of ad was characterised by the parameter @xmath44 : 0.5 to 2.0 , corresponding to @xmath45 from 0.25 to 1.0 . the lower the value , the greater the degree the degree of ad .",
    "thus , figure 3 indicates the need for anomalous diffusion becoming more and more important as the cr energy increases .    the cause of this increase in anomalous diffusion is not immediately apparent . it would appear that higher energy particles sample parts of the inner galaxy (  where the turbulence is bigger  ) to a greater degree than those of lower energy . in turn",
    ", this suggests that the scale height increases with energy , in distinction to the usual assumption of energy independence .",
    "the solution may lie in the model in which particles spiral around field lines and transfer from one line to another before joining a line that leads to escape from the galaxy .",
    "the transfer probability may be energy dependent .",
    "the conventional diffusion model itself is not without problems , in that cr are assumed to diffuse until they reach a height where they immediately escape ; such a model is , again , simplistic .",
    "the conventional galactic wind may have a role to play , in that its effect is energy dependent .",
    "however , at tev energies and above its effect would not be expected to significant .",
    "another aspect of the galactic wind may be relevant at energies approaching on pev , however .",
    "this relates to the possibility of acceleration of particles at the termination shock , following @xcite .",
    "insofar as the mechanism sends energetic cr back towards the galactic disc the termination shock acts as a reflecting boundary. this is just what is required in our ns model , although it must be pointed out that the energies considered in @xcite are somewhat higher than those considered here .    understandably , changing the lifetime of cr requires a change in the cr injection spectrum . specifically",
    ", the injection spectrum will need to be steeper .",
    "we have adopted an exponent (  @xmath46 in @xmath47  ) equal to 2.15 and this fits the observed proton energy spectrum for @xmath23 .",
    "changing @xmath1 to 0.2 , for example , would need @xmath48 , a value increasingly away from the standard @xmath49 for fermi acceleration in a snr envelope .    however , help is at hand when consideration is given to the time sequence of acceleration in snr .",
    "as we have shown @xcite the higher energy particles achieve most of their energy at later times .",
    "specifically , most of the cr of @xmath50 are accelerated in the last 20% of the time of the expansion of the remnant (  64 to 80 kyears in our model  ) .",
    "thus , a steepened injection spectrum would arise quite naturally if snr were leaky at these late ages .",
    "in fact , inspection of the observed snr shows that they are rarely spherical and leakage seems inevitable .",
    "this feature is particularly marked for those snr in the inner galaxy .",
    "a further fact of relevance is the inevitable spread in the maximum energies of cr from snr , arising from the variety of total energies , ism densities and magnetic fields .",

    "<S> we find a high degree of consistency amongst the various measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the new data indicate that at an energy above @xmath00.1 pev a change of the cr anisotropy sets in . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the first harmonic , which rises to 3 tev , then diminishes and begins to rise again . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the phase also changes to the opposite one . </S>",
    "<S> a measure of understanding follows from the use of two - dimensional maps of cosmic ray excesses over the mean background . </S>",
    "<S> when the energy of cosmic rays approaches the pev region , the excess of cosmic rays moves from the galactic anti - centre to the opposite direction of the galactic centre . </S>",
    "<S> the possible role of such potential cosmic ray sources as the supernovae monogem ring and vela , which could help to explain some of the observed results , is discussed . </S>"
