    "spatial autocorrelation statistics measure and analyze the degree of dependency among observations in a geographic space . in this paper , we are interested in @xmath0 statistic , which seems the most popular measure of spatial autocorrelation . to the best of my knowledge , however , the property has not been thoroughly investigated . to be worse , there are some misunderstandings with respect to similarity to pearson s correlation coefficient . in some books as well as wikipedia , it is claimed that the range of moran s @xmath0 is exactly @xmath3 $ ] like pearson s correlation coefficient .",
    "however it is not true .    in section [ sec : original ] of this paper , we give the exact range of moran s @xmath0 as a function of spatial weights matrix . in our numerical experiment ,",
