    "color confinement mechanism in qcd is still to be understood .",
    "many works@xcite have been done to clarify the confinement mechanism on the basis of the idea of abelian projection of qcd @xcite .",
    "the abelian projection of qcd is to extract an abelian theory performing a partial gauge - fixing .",
    "after an abelian projection , @xmath2 qcd can be regarded as a @xmath3 abelian gauge theory with magnetic monopoles and electric charges .",
    "thooft conjectured that the condensation of the abelian monopoles is the confinement mechanism in qcd@xcite .",
    "an effective @xmath4 monopole action is derived from vacuum configurations in @xmath5 qcd after an abelian projection in a special gauge called maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge@xcite .",
    "entropy dominance over energy of the monopole loops , i.e. , condensation of the monopole loops seems to occur always ( for all values of the coupling constant @xmath6 ) in the infinite - volume limit when extended monopoles@xcite are considered@xcite .",
    "the abelian charge is confined due to the monopole condensation .",
    "the confinement of the abelian charge after abelian projection means color confinement as shown in @xcite .",
    "monopole condensation is known to be the confinement mechanism also in lattice compact qed@xcite .",
    "the string tension is a key quantity of confinement .",
    "it vanishes at the deconfinement transition temperature @xmath7@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the same string tension can be derived from wilson loops written in terms of abelian link fields alone after the abelian projection in the ma gauge@xcite .",
    "the string tension derived from the abelian wilson loops also vanishes at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the abelian wilson loops can be expressed by a product of monopole and photon contributions@xcite .",
    "the monopoles alone are responsible for the string tension in @xmath8@xcite and @xmath9@xcite @xmath5 qcd .",
    "the same results are obtained also in @xmath2 qcd@xcite .",
    "these results strongly support the thooft conjecture@xcite in @xmath5 qcd .",
    "however , the above results are restricted to the special ma gauge .",
    "what happens in other abelian projections is not known yet .",
    "for example , abelian wilson loops in some unitary gauges are too small to derive reliably the string tension@xcite , although it does not mean that the string tension can not be derived in the gauges .",
    "a polyakov loop is another good order parameter , the vanishing of which means color - flux squeezing in the confinement phase .",
    "it is the aim of this note to show that 1 )  a polyakov loop written in terms of abelian link fields alone is a good order parameter@xcite , 2 )  it can be written by a product of contributions from dirac strings of monopoles and from photons , 3 )  the former alone vanishes in the confinement phase and 4 )  these results are independent of the gauge choice of abelian projection .",
    "the first statement in the ma gauge was already shown in @xcite .",
    "we adopt the usual @xmath5 wilson action .",
    "to study gauge dependence , we consider here three types of abelian projection , i.e. , the ma gauge and two unitary gauges .",
    "the ma gauge is given @xcite by performing a local gauge transformation @xmath10 such that @xmath11 is maximized .",
    "then a matrix @xmath12 is diagonalized . here",
    "two unitary gauges considered here are defined by performing a local gauge transformation @xmath10 such that one of the following two matrices is diagonalized : @xmath14 where the sum in ( [ x3 ] ) is over all plaquette directions .",
    "we call the former ( the latter ) polyakov ( @xmath15 ) gauge .",
    "after the gauge fixing is over , there still remains a @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "we can extract an abelian link gauge variable from the @xmath5 ones as follows ; @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a diagonal abelian gauge field and @xmath18 has off - diagonal components corresponding to charged matters .",
    "note that a @xmath4 invariant quantity written in terms of the abelian link variables @xmath17 after an abelian projection is @xmath5 invariant@xcite .",
    "now let us show that an abelian polyakov loop operator after the abelian projection @xmath19 ,   \\label{apol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is given by a product of monopole and photon contributions . here",
    "@xmath20 is an external current taking @xmath21 along the straight line in the fourth direction and @xmath22 is an angle variable defined from @xmath17 as follows : @xmath23    using the definition of a plaquette variable @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a forward difference , we get @xmath26 , \\label{t4}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the lattice coulomb propagator and @xmath28 is a backward difference .",
    "we have used @xmath29 . since @xmath30 , the second term in the right - hand side of ( [ t4 ] ) does not contribute to the abelian polyakov loop ( [ apol ] ) .",
    "hence we get @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{apol2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the gauge plaquette variable can be decomposed into two terms : @xmath32 where @xmath33 includes only a photon field and @xmath34 is an integer - valued plaquette variable denoting the number of dirac strings through the plaquette coming out of monopoles@xcite .",
    "hence we get @xmath35,\\\\ p_1 & = & \\exp\\{-i\\sum_{i=1}^{n_4 } j_4 ( s+(i-1)\\hat4)\\sum_{s ' } d(s+(i-1)\\hat4-s')\\partial'_{\\nu}\\bar{f}_{\\nu 4}(s')\\},\\\\ p_2 & = & \\exp\\{-2\\pi i\\sum_{i=1}^{n_4 } j_4 ( s+(i-1)\\hat4)\\sum_{s ' } d(s+(i-1)\\hat4-s')\\partial'_{\\nu}n_{\\nu 4}(s')\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we observe the photon ( @xmath36 ) and the dirac - string ( @xmath37 ) contributions separately : @xmath38 \\hspace{1 cm } { \\rm and } \\hspace{1 cm } p_m = { \\rm re}[p_2].\\ ] ]",
    "the above separation can be done also in the case of compact qed .",
    "we first measure @xmath39 and @xmath40 adopting the villain form@xcite of the partition function on a @xmath41 lattice",
    ". since there are natural monopoles and degrand - toussaint monopoles in the villain case of qed , we observe @xmath42 in terms of the two types of the monopoles . since the auto - correlation time is long for @xmath43 , we have to perform monte - carlo simulations carefully .",
    "we follow the same method as done in @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ villain ] .",
    "we find the following .    1 .",
    "the monopole dirac - string data vanish in the confinement phase , whereas the photon data remain finite and change gradually for all @xmath6 .",
    "the characteristic features of the polyakov loops are then due to the behaviors of the dirac - string contributions alone .",
    "2 .   monopole polyakov loops show more enhancement than the total ones for @xmath43 .",
    "both types of monopoles give almost the same results .",
    "the monte - carlo simulations were done in @xmath5 on @xmath44 lattice from @xmath45 to @xmath46 in the ma gauge and in the unitary gauges . in @xmath2 qcd , we adopted @xmath47 lattice from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "all measurements were done every 50 sweeps ( 40 sweeps in the @xmath2 case ) after a thermalization of 2000 sweeps .",
    "we took 50 configurations totally for measurements .",
    "the gauge - fixing criterion in the ma gauge is the same as done in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results in the ma gauge are shown in the following :    1 .",
    "we plot the @xmath5 data in the ma gauge in fig .",
    "the abelian polyakov loops remain zero in the confinement phase , whereas they begin to rise from the critical temperature @xmath50@xcite this was observed already in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the dirac - string contribution shows similar behaviors more drastically .",
    "it is zero for @xmath51 , whereas it begins to rise rapidly and it reaches @xmath52 for large @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "the photon part has a finite contribution for both phases and it changes only slightly .",
    "characteristic behaviors of the abelian polyakov loops as an order parameter of deconfinement transition are then explained by the dirac - string part of monopoles alone .",
    "this is consistent with the results in @xcite stating monopoles alone are responsible for the value of the string tension .",
    "the same results are obtained also in pure @xmath2 qcd in the ma gauge as shown in fig .",
    "the monopole dirac string alone is seen to be responsible for the flux squeezing .",
    "there is a clear hysteresis behavior showing the first order transition .",
    "we next study the case in the unitary gauges .    1 .",
    "the data in the unitary gauges are plotted in fig .  [ pol ] and fig .  [ f12 ] .",
    "it is very interesting to see that qualitative features are similar to those in the ma gauge .",
    "namely , the abelian and the dirac - string polyakov loops are zero in the confinement phase , which suggests occurrence of flux squeezing in the unitary gauges , too .",
    "they show finite contribution above the critical temperature @xmath53 .",
    "photon contributions are finite and change gradually in both phases .",
    "the dirac - string part of monopoles is responsible for the essential features of an order parameter .",
    "_ these are the first phenomena suggesting gauge independence of the thooft conjecture . _ 2 .   comparing the figures in the unitary gauges , one can see both are almost equal , although the gauge fixing conditions are quite different .",
    "the finite values in the deconfinement phase in fig .",
    "[ pol ] and fig .  [ f12 ] are much smaller than those in fig .",
    "[ ma ] in the ma gauge .",
    "it is similar to the behaviors of wilson loops in these gauges studied in @xcite .",
    "namely , abelian wilson loops in the ma gauge enhance drastically and then we could determine the string tension .",
    "on the other hand , the wilson loops in the unitary gauges are too small to fix the string tension reliably .",
    "3 .   there is a problem in extracting monopoles in the unitary gauges in comparison with the case in the ma gauge , as seen from the histogram of @xmath54 in some configurations .",
    "the data in both gauges are shown in fig .",
    "[ fmunu ] and fig .",
    "[ fmunup ] .",
    "the data in the ma gauge was first studied in @xcite . in the ma gauge ,",
    "quantum fluctuation is small and it is reliable to separate dirac strings out of @xmath54 .",
    "however , in the unitary gauges , the separation between dirac strings and quantum fluctuation is more ambiguous as seen from the bump around @xmath55 in the histogram . to be noted ,",
    "the bump becomes smaller as @xmath6 becomes larger .",
    "this is because quantum fluctuation becomes smaller for larger @xmath6 .",
    "hence , we may expect that the correct string tension can be derived even in unitary gauges when we consider the @xmath56 case for large @xmath6 on larger lattices .",
    "in conclusion , our analyses done here strongly suggest that abelian monopoles are responsible for confinement in @xmath5 qcd and condensation of the monopoles is the confinement mechanism .",
    "we have found first the data suggesting gauge independence of the thooft conjecture .",
    "our data show the following picture of color confinement due to monopole condensation .",
    "choose any @xmath4 out of @xmath5 through an abelian projection .",
    "then quarks and gluons behave like charged matters with respect to the @xmath4 symmetry after the abelian projection . there are always monopoles with magnetic charges with respect to the magnetic @xmath4 symmetry dual to the @xmath4 chosen .",
    "the electric @xmath4 charge is confined due to the dual meissner effect caused by the condensation of the corresponding monopoles . the electric charge confinement after abelian projection is equivalent to color confinement as proved in @xcite .",
    "gauge independence of the confinement mechanism appears in this way .    in @xcite ,",
    "abelian wilson loops have been measured in various gauges .",
    "the abelian wilson loops in the unitary gauges do not show abelian dominance and take a similar value to that without gauge - fixing . suggested from the study , we have tried to measure abelian polyakov loops without gauge - fixing , although such quantities are gauge variant .",
    "abelian link fields are defined by choosing any one of isospin directions .",
    "surprisingly enough , we have obtained a similar behavior as shown in fig .",
    "[ ngpol ] .",
    "the abelian polyakov loop is zero in the confinement phase and shows rising at the critical @xmath53 .",
    "the responsibility of the dirac string is also seen .",
    "the abelian quantity without gauge - fixing is variant under local @xmath5 transformation .",
    "hence to see whether the above behavior includes some physical meaning or not , we have also measured abelian polyakov loops composed of abelian links defined randomly at each site .",
    "namely abelian links in the time direction at each site are defined to take a random isospin direction .",
    "the data are shown in fig .",
    "[ ngpolr ] .",
    "qualitatively similar behaviors are obtained , although the finite values of the total and the dirac - string contributions in the deconfinement region are smaller . these data may support the above picture of gauge independence of the thooft idea . to prove gauge independence definitely is to be studied in future .",
