    "since the first experimental realisation of a bose - einstein condensation on a micro - chip  @xcite , the study of the interactions between ultra cold atoms and surfaces is of crucial interest .",
    "for instance , the quality of the wires used in micro fabricated chips is directly linked to the fragmentation effects observed in trapped bec near a metallic wire @xcite .",
    "also , it has been shown than the thermal fluctuations of the current in a metallic surface could induce spin flip losses in an atomic cloud when the distance to the surface is smaller than @xmath0 m typically @xcite .",
    "the use of dielectric surfaces and evanescent waves for producing strong confinement has not been so widely explored yet .",
    "it has the advandage of a strong suppression of the spin flip loss mechanism @xcite .",
    "with such a system , one can realize mirrors @xcite , diffraction gratings @xcite , 2d traps @xcite or waveguides @xcite .",
    "experiments involving ultra cold atoms from a bose - einstein condensate at the vicinity of a dielectric surface started only recently , leading for instance to the realisation of a two dimensional bec @xcite or to sensitive measurements of adsorbate electric polarization @xcite .    in this paper , we present recent experimental results of bose condensed atoms interacting with the light field of an evanescent wave above a dielectric slab .",
    "an optical waveguide on a dielectric substrate was designed for studying two dimensional geometries @xcite .",
    "when a blue detuned light is injected into this waveguide , it results in an atomic mirror for the condensed atoms released from a ioffe pritchard magnetic trap . we observe a strong scattering of the atomic cloud due to the surface roughness .",
    "section  [ experiment ] is devoted to the description of the experiment and the analyse of the results .",
    "section  [ theory ] presents the comparison with a theoretical model developped by henkel _",

    "this surface coating was designed to enhance the evanescent field above the waveguide  @xcite .",
    "the incident angle is fixed by the resonance condition for a te polarization inside the waveguide . at the tio@xmath3 - vacuum interface , the resulting angle is @xmath5 which leads to a decay length of the light field @xmath6  nm where @xmath7 . in the horizontal plane ,",
    "the mode propagates along @xmath8 with a wave vector @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the free space wave vector and @xmath12  nm the laser wavelength .",
    "the light coupled into the waveguide is produced by a gaussian shaped laser diode of power 40  mw detuned 1.5  ghz to the blue of the @xmath13 d2 line of @xmath14rb .",
    "the gaussian beam is elliptical and is focused at the prism surface to a @xmath15 waist diameter of @xmath16 m in the plane of incidence and @xmath17 m along @xmath1 . here",
    ", one denotes @xmath8 as the propagation axis of the evanescent wave along the surface , @xmath1 as the other horizontal axis and @xmath2 as the vertical one ( see figure  [ prism ] ) .",
    "after projection onto the surface , the @xmath8 waist is @xmath18 m whereas the @xmath1 waist remains unchanged .",
    "the light intensity at the center of the spot at the surface is 210  w/@xmath19 .",
    "this value is deduced from a measurement of the light intensity threshold for the atomic reflection , taking into account the van der waals attraction to the surface .",
    "note that the number of photons scattered by each atom during reflection is about @xmath20 only .",
    "experimental details on the bose - einstein condensation set - up are given in ref .",
    "@xmath14rb atoms are prepared and condensed in the @xmath21 state in a magnetic ioffe - pritchard type trap , elongated along @xmath8 , with oscillation frequencies respectively @xmath22  hz along @xmath8 and @xmath23  hz in the radial directions . the center of the magnetic trap sits at @xmath24  mm above the evanescent mirror . this distance can be adjusted with of another pair of magnetic coils  @xcite . about @xmath25 atoms cooled to below the condensation threshold",
    "are released from the magnetic trap .",
    "they experience a free fall of 27  ms before reaching the evanescent wave and being reflected .",
    "the laser beam creating the mirror is switched on for only 2.2  ms to avoid photon scattering during free fall and after reflection .",
    "this time is nevertheless sufficient to ensure a full reflection of the whole atomic cloud .",
    "an absorption picture is taken at the end of the experimental sequence , either before or after reflection .    from the pictures taken before reflection",
    ", we infer experimental parameters which will be useful for further analysis .",
    "one calibrates the pixel size by the center of mass motion under gravitation .",
    "we have also noticed an initial horizontal velocity @xmath26mm / s , due to a transient inhomogeneous magnetic field during the switching off procedure . from the balistic expansion",
    ", we get the fraction of condensed atoms ( @xmath27 ) , the temperature of the thermal cloud @xmath28  nk , the thomas - fermi radius along @xmath8 @xmath29 m and the velocity radius along @xmath2 @xmath30  mm / s .",
    "the velocity radius along @xmath8 , @xmath31 , is not measurable , being very small .",
    "however , following ref .",
    "@xcite , it can be deduced from @xmath32 and the ratio of the oscillation frequencies in the magnetic trap : @xmath33  mm / s .",

    "nevertheless , it can be deduced from a careful analysis of the data , in conjunction with a numerical simulation reproducing the experiment for different possible values of the @xmath1 velocity spreading .",
    "it is clear for instance that , in the case of a totally isotropic scattering , the atomic cloud would shade on the @xmath43 plane towards the surface .",
    "in contrast , a one dimensional scattering along @xmath8 would present a circle line .",
    "the experimental picture is compared with a picture calculated for a diffuse reflection , knowing all initial parameters of the expansion and the amplitude @xmath44 of the scattering along @xmath8 . the corresponding @xmath1 amplitude @xmath42",
    "is given as an input parameter and the output image should correspond at best to the experimental image . @xmath45",
    "classical atomic trajectories are calculated , with random initial positions and velocities which match the initial thomas - fermi position and velocity distribution for 40  % of atoms in the condensate , the other distributions corresponding to those of a thermal cloud at 285  nk in the harmonic trap with known oscillation frequencies .",
    "only the initial position of the condensed part width along @xmath1 and @xmath2 is neglected , because its contribution to the total width is very small already after a few milliseconds of ballistic expansion . in the calculation , the mirror is flat and the @xmath2 component of the atomic velocity is instantaneously reversed , thus neglecting the exponential character of the real mirror : it does nt play an important role in the dynamics at a such height , the bouncing time being in the order of the microsecond .",
    "the mirror roughness is taken into account by adding a random horizontal velocity to the incoming one , distributed on a gaussian with a fixed width @xmath44 along @xmath8 and a tentative width @xmath42 along @xmath1 .",
    "the vertical velocity of each atom is modified correspondingly to ensure energy conservation .",
    "the final calculated image is produced by integrating the atomic density along the imaging direction ( @xmath1 axis ) .",
    "the direct comparison of the experimental and calculated picture confirms that the simulation nicely reproduces the overall behaviour of the atoms ( figure  [ bounce ] ) . to be more quantitative ,",
    "we isolate a small region of size 0.8  mm @xmath41 1.5  mm along @xmath8 and @xmath2 respectively , centered on the peak density , and compare the profiles deduced after integration along @xmath8 for both pictures ( the integration can not be performed over the whole sample due to the curvature of the signal ) .",

    ". a reasonable value for @xmath42 would be @xmath56 , that is an anisotropy @xmath57 .",
    "we can not exclude values of @xmath58 as low as 1.5 or as high as 2.5 ; in any case , the scattering is larger in the direction of propagation of the real part @xmath9 of the optical wave vector .",
    "the problem of diffuse reflection of atoms off an evanescent wave mirror has been addressed theoretically in ref  @xcite and it linked to the scattering of light by the defects of a rough dielectric surface .",
    "atom scattering is due to raman stimulated transitions involving a photon of the evanescent mode and a scattered photon .",
    "the expected momentum distribution after reflection can be calculated from the knowledge of the roughness power spectrum @xmath59 of the surface and an atomic response function @xmath60 [ eqs.(5.6 , 5.7 ) of ref.@xcite ] .",
    "@xmath61 is an in plane two dimensional wave vector . for normal incidence onto the surface ,",
    "the variance of the velocity distribution after the bounce is then given by @xmath62 @xmath63 is a normalization factor , related to the scattering probability @xmath64 through @xmath65 equation ( [ eq : dqx - theory ] ) allows one to compute the anisotropy of the velocity width after reflection , the dependence on the angle of incidence being actually negligible for our parameters ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the roughness power spectrum may be inferred from a measurement of the surface . for most surfaces ,",
    "this spectrum follows a power law @xmath66 , with @xmath67 being typically between 2 and 5 .",
    "the atomic response function @xmath60 has a complicated expression .",
    "nevertheless , for atomic incidence normal to the surface , it is very peaked around two circles centered at @xmath68 of radius @xmath69 .",
    "we will thus model this function by a delta function around these circles , @xmath70 .",
    "note that this corresponds to the absorption of a photon from the guided mode and the successive stimulated emission into a free mode at grazing incidence  or vice - versa .",
    "these two processes contributes to the same amount to @xmath71 , as @xmath72 only depends on the modulus of the transferred wave vector .",
    "the integration may be performed around the value @xmath73 , leading to : @xmath74 @xmath75 after integration and simplification , with a power law for the roughness spectrum , we get : @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "this expression depends only slightly on the choice of @xmath67 : @xmath58 lies between 2.05 and 2.31 for values of @xmath67 between 2 and 5 which are relevant for a typical polished dielectric surface .",
    "it is minimum for @xmath78 and has the same value for @xmath67 and @xmath79 . in the case",
    "@xmath80 , the expression for @xmath81 is very simple as we have @xmath82 , which for our parameters leads to @xmath83 , in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the evaluation of the expected momentum spreading is more delicate , as a full knowledge of @xmath60 and @xmath59 would be required to estimate @xmath64 .",
    "however , if one knows the rms surface roughness , it is possible to give an upper bound of the effect using the upper limit for the total diffuse reflection probability @xmath84 ( eq .",
    "( 5.21 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath85 here @xmath86 is the mean de broglie wave length of the incoming cloud , @xmath87 is the height of the classical reflection turning point , and @xmath88 is the surface roughness defined as the square root of the variance of the surface height .",
    "the velocity spreading may then be estimated as being , for example in the @xmath8 direction : @xmath89 a surface roughness of @xmath90  nm was deduced from an afm measurement of a portion of the prism . for @xmath91 , and a falling height of 3.6  mm",
    ", we find an expected maximum velocity spreading along @xmath8 of @xmath92 , a bit higher than the observed @xmath93 .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed measurements on the diffuse reflection of a bose - einstein condensate on a rough surface .",
    "the experiment shows a strong scattering of the atomic cloud , due to elastic raman photon scattering involving both the mirror light and scattered light . a first clear evidence of the anisotropy of this diffuse reflection is given  @xcite .",
    "the scattering is twice along the direction of propagation of the evanescent mode , and this value is in good agreement with the prediction of henkel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , in a simplified model .",
    "a tentative absolute value for the scattering amplitude was also given , in a reasonable agreement with the experiment .",
    "however , a more precise analysis would be necessary to confirm the anisotropy value and the absolute value  @xcite .",
    "the experiments were performed with a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "however , the coherence of the source is not visible on the results  no speckle is visible for instance . an estimation of the size of the speckle spots , on the order of @xmath94 where @xmath24  mm is the distance between cloud and surface and @xmath95 m its size at the reflection point , would give typically 1  @xmath96 m , which is not resolved by the imaging system .",
    "nevertheless , the reflection should be coherent , the spontaneous photon scattering being negligible . to prevent diffuse reflection",
    ", a great care should be taken in the surface quality .",
    "we point out however that the atom scattering did not mask the diffraction pattern in a temporal diffraction experiment we performed with the very same prism  @xcite .",
