    "non - perturbative hamiltonian light - front quantum field theory presents opportunities and challenges that bridge particle physics and nuclear physics .",
    "major goals include predicting both the masses and transitions rates of the hadrons and their structures as seen in high - momentum transfer experiments .",
    "current focii of intense experimental and theoretical research that could benefit from insights derived within this hamiltonian approach include the spin structure of the proton , the neutron electromagnetic form factor , the generalized parton distributions of the baryons , etc .",
    "hamiltonian light - front field theory in a discretized momentum basis @xcite and in transverse lattice approaches @xcite have shown significant promise .",
    "we present here a basis - function approach that exploits recent advances in solving the non - relativistic strongly interacting nuclear many - body problem @xcite .",
    "we note that both light - front field theory and nuclear many - body theory face common issues within the hamiltonian approach - i.e. how to ( 1 ) define the hamiltonian ; ( 2 ) renormalize to a finite space ; ( 3 ) solve for non - perturbative observables while preserving as many symmetries as possible ; and , ( 4 ) take the continuum limit . in spite of the technical hurdles ,",
    "ken wilson has assessed the advantages of adopting advances in quantum many - body theory and has long advocated adoption of basis function methods as an alternative to the lattice gauge approach @xcite .",
    "there are three main advantages of hamiltonian light - front quantum field theory motivating our efforts to overcome the technical hurdles .",
    "first , one evaluates experimental observables that are non - perturbative and relativistically invariant quantities such as masses , form factors , structure functions , etc .",
    "second , one evaluates these quantities in minkowski space and , third , there is no fermion doubling problem .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of recent advances in solving light nuclei with realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) and three - nucleon ( nnn ) interactions using _ ab initio _ no - core methods in a basis function representation .",
    "then , we introduce our basis function approach to light - front qcd within the light - front gauge . renormalization / regularization issues are also addressed .",
    "we present illustrative features of our approach with the example of cavity - mode qed and sketch its extension to cavity - mode qcd . for a specific qed example , we work in small basis spaces and solve for the mass eigenstates of an electron coupled to a single photon in a transverse harmonic oscillator cavity .",
    "the present work is an expanded version of a recent paper where we provided an initial introduction to our approach @xcite .",
    "to solve for the properties of nuclei , self - bound strongly interacting systems , with realistic hamiltonians , one faces immense analytical and computational challenges .",
    "recently , _",
    "ab initio _ methods have been developed that preserve all the underlying symmetries and converge to the exact result .",
    "the basis function approach that we adopt here @xcite is one of several methods shown to be successful .",
    "the primary advantages are its flexibility for choosing the hamiltonian , the method of renormalization / regularization and the basis space . these advantages impel us to adopt the basis function approach in light - front quantum field theory .",
    "while non - relativistic applications in finite nuclei restrict the basis to a fixed number of fermions , we introduce here the extension to a flexible number of fermions , antifermions and bosons .",
    "@xcite and @xcite provide examples of the recent advances in the _ ab initio _ ncsm and ncfc , respectively . the former adopts a finite basis - space renormalization method and applies it to realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) and three - nucleon ( nnn ) interactions ( derived from chiral effective field theory ) to solve nuclei with atomic numbers @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "experimental binding energies , spectra , electromagnetic moments and transition rates are well - reproduced .",
    "the latter adopts a realistic nn interaction that is sufficiently soft that renormalization is not necessary and binding energies obtained from a sequence of finite matrix solutions may be extrapolated to the infinite matrix limit .",
    "owing to uniform convergence and the variational principle , one is also able to assess the theoretical uncertainties in the extrapolated result .",
    "one again obtains good agreement with experiment .",
    "it is important to note the analytical and technical advances made to solve these problems .",
    "first , non - perturbative renormalization has been developed to accompany these basis - space methods that preserve all the symmetries of the underlying hamiltonian including highly precise treatments of the center - of - mass motion .",
    "several schemes have emerged with impressive successes and current research focuses on detailed understanding of the scheme - dependence of convergence rates ( different observables converge at different rates ) @xcite .",
    "second , large scale calculations are performed on leadership - class parallel computers , at argonne national laboratory and at oak ridge national laboratory , to solve for the low - lying eigenstates and eigenvectors as well as to carry out evaluation of a suite of experimental observables .",
    "for example , one can now obtain the low - lying solutions for @xmath1 systems with matrices of dimension one to three billion on 8000 to 50000 processors within a few hours of wallclock time .",
    "since the techniques are evolving rapidly @xcite and the computers are growing dramatically , much larger matrices are within reach .    in a ncsm or ncfc application , one adopts a 3-d harmonic oscillator for all the particles in the nucleus ( with harmonic oscillator energy @xmath2 ) , treats the neutrons and protons independently , and generates a many - fermion basis space that includes the lowest oscillator configurations as well as all those generated by allowing up to @xmath3 oscillator quanta of excitations .",
    "the single - particle states are formed by coupling the orbital angular momentum to the spin forming the total angular momentum @xmath4 and total angular momentum projection @xmath5 .",
    "the many - fermion basis consists of states where particles occupy the allowed orbits subject to the additional constraint that the total angular momentum projection @xmath6 is a pre - selected value .",
    "this is referred to as the @xmath7-scheme basis and , in a single run , one obtains eigenstates with total angular momentum @xmath8 . for the ncsm",
    "one also selects a renormalization scheme linked to the many - body basis space truncation while in the ncfc the renormalization is either absent or of a type that retains the infinite matrix problem . in the ncfc case @xcite ,",
    "one extrapolates to the continuum limit as we now illustrate .",
    "c for @xmath9 ( discrete points ) at selected values of the oscillator energy , @xmath2 . for each @xmath2 ,",
    "the results are fit to an exponential plus a constant , the asymptote , which is constrained to be the same for each curve@xcite .",
    "we display the experimental ground state energy and the common asymptote . ]",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ 12c ] results for the ground state of @xmath10",
    "as a function of @xmath3 obtained with a realistic nn interaction , jisp16 @xcite .",
    "the smooth curves portray fits that achieve the desired independence of @xmath3 and @xmath2 so as to yield the extrapolated ground state energy .",
    "our assessed uncertainty in the extrapolant is about 2 mev and there is rather good agreement with experiment within that uncertainty .",
    "the largest cases presented in fig .",
    "[ 12c ] correspond to @xmath11 , where the matrix reaches a basis dimension near 600 million .",
    "@xmath12 produces a matrix near 8 billion and its lowest eigenvalues have now been solved at two values of @xmath2 .",
    "these @xmath12 results follow closely the curves shown in fig . [",
    "12c ] and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "it has long been known that light - front hamiltonian quantum field theory has similarities with non - relativistic quantum many - body theory .",
    "we further exploit this connection , in what we will term a  basis light front quantized ( blfq ) \" approach , by adopting a light - front single - particle basis space consisting of the 2-d harmonic oscillator for the transverse modes ( radial coordinate @xmath13 and polar angle @xmath14 ) and a discretized momentum space basis for the longitudinal modes .",
    "adoption of this basis is also consistent with recent developments in ads / cft correspondence with qcd @xcite . in the present application to the non - interacting problem",
    ", we will adopt periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) for the longitudinal modes and we omit the zero mode . for our light - front coordinates ,",
    "we define @xmath15 , @xmath16 and coordinate pair @xmath17 are the usual cylindrical coordinates in @xmath18 .",
    "the variable @xmath19 is light - front time and @xmath20 is the longitudinal coordinate .",
    "we adopt @xmath21 , the  null plane \" , for our quantization surface .",
    "the 2-d oscillator states are characterized by their principal quantum number @xmath22 , orbital quantum number @xmath7 and harmonic oscillator energy @xmath23 .",
    "it is also convenient to interpret the 2-d oscillator as a function of the dimensionless radial variable @xmath24 where @xmath25 has units of mass and @xmath13 is the conventional radial variable in units of length .",
    "thus , the length scale for transverse modes is set by the chosen value of @xmath26 .",
    "the properly orthonormalized wavefunctions , @xmath27 , are given in terms of the generalized laguerre polynomials , @xmath28 , by @xmath29 with eigenvalues @xmath30 .",
    "the orthonormalization is fixed by @xmath31 which allows for an arbitrary phase factor @xmath32 that we have taken to be unity .",
    "one of the significant advantages of the 2-d oscillator basis is the relative ease for transforming results between coordinate space and momentum space .",
    "that is , the fourier transformed wavefunctions have the same analytic structure in both coordinate and momentum space , a feature reminiscent of a plane - wave basis .     of the 2-d harmonic oscillator selected for the transverse basis functions .",
    "the orbital quantum number @xmath7 progresses across the rows by integer steps from 0 in the upper left to 4 in the lower right and counts the pairs of angular lobes .",

    "[ boxbc_3d_mode ] .",
    "our purpose in presenting both figs .",
    "[ apbc_3d_mode ] and [ boxbc_3d_mode ] is to suggest the richness , flexibility and economy of texture available for solutions in a basis function approach .",
    "note that the choice of basis functions is rather arbitrary , including which boundary conditions are imposed , except for the standard conditions of orthonormality and completeness within the selected symmetries .     with antiperiodic boundary conditions ( apbc ) .",
    "the quantum numbers for this basis function are given in the caption .",
    "the basis function is shown for the full range @xmath34 . ]     with box boundary conditions ( wavefunction vanishes at @xmath43l ) .",
    "the quantum numbers for this basis function are given in the caption .",
    "the basis function is shown for positive values of @xmath20 and is antisymmetric with respect to @xmath44    although our choice of basis functions is not dictated by theory , it is buttressed by the phenomenological success of the  soft - wall \" ads / qcd model  @xcite which uses a harmonic oscillator potential in the fifth dimension of anti - de sitter space to simulate color confinement .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite one can use  light - front holography \"  @xcite to transform the bound state equations for the wavefunction in ads space  @xcite to a corresponding bound - state equation in physical space at fixed light - front time @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting light - front equation is similar in form to the schrdinger radial wave equation at fixed @xmath46 which describes the quantum - mechanical structure of atomic systems .",
    "however , the formalism at fixed light - front time is relativistic and frame independent .",
    "thus , for the specific example of a @xmath47 pair , one obtains a relativistic wave equation applicable to hadron physics , where the light - front coordinate @xmath48 plays the role of the radial variable @xmath49 of the nonrelativistic theory . here , @xmath50 is the light - front momentum fraction of the quark and @xmath51 is the magnitude of the transverse relative separation coordinate . in this example , the meson eigenvalue equation is  @xcite @xmath52\\phi(\\zeta ) =   m^2\\phi(\\zeta ) , % { \\cal m}^2\\phi(\\zeta ) , \\label{eq : adslfwf}\\ ] ] where the complexity of the qcd interactions among constituents is summed up in the addition of the effective potential @xmath53 , which is then modeled to enforce confinement .",
    "the potential in the soft wall model is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total angular momentum of the hadron . using the substitution @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we arrive at the transverse 2-d harmonic oscillator wave equation",
    "whose solution is given in eq .",
    "[ eq : wfn2dhofx ] .",
    "there is one additional distinction between our choice of transverse basis functions and the solutions of the ads / qcd model : we adopt single - parton coordinates as the basis function arguments while ads / qcd adopts a relative coordinate between the constituents .",
    "our selection is natural for the applications within an external cavity that we present here and is most convenient for enforcing the boson and fermion statistics when dealing with arbitrary many partons . in future work without the external cavity ,",
    "we may invoke a lagrange multiplier method , analogous to the method in the ncsm and ncfc approaches @xcite , to separate the relative motion from the total system s motion in the transverse direction .",
    "the solutions of the light - front equation ( [ eq : adslfwf ] ) determine the masses of the hadrons , given the total internal spin @xmath59 , the orbital angular momenta @xmath60 of the constituents , and the index @xmath22 , the number of nodes of the wavefunction in @xmath61 .",
    "for example , if the total quark spin @xmath59 is zero , the meson bound state spectrum follows the quadratic form @xmath62 thus the internal orbital angular momentum @xmath60 and its effect on quark kinetic energy play an explicit role .",
    "the corresponding wavefunctions of the mesonic eigensolutions describe the probability distribution of the @xmath47 constituents for the different orbital and radial states .",
    "the separation of the constituent quark and antiquark in ads space get larger as the orbital angular momentum increases .",
    "the pion with @xmath63 and @xmath64 is massless for zero quark mass , in agreement with general arguments based on chiral symmetry .",
    "if the total spin of the constituents is @xmath65 , the corresponding mass formula for the orbital and radial spectrum of the @xmath13 and @xmath66 vector mesons is @xmath67 .",
    "the states are aligned along linear regge trajectories and agree well with experiment .",
    "the resulting light - front wavefunctions also give a good account of the hadron form factors .",
    "the ads / qcd model , together with light - front holography , provides a semiclassical first approximation to strongly coupled qcd .",
    "the blfq approach in this paper provides a natural extension of the ads / qcd light - front wavefunctions to multiquark and multi - gluonic fock states , thus allowing for particle creation and absorption . by setting up and diagonalizing the light - front qcd hamiltonian on this basis",
    ", we incorporate higher order corrections corresponding to the full qcd theory , and we hope to gain insights into the success of the ads / qcd model .",
    "for a first application of the blfq approach , we consider a non - interacting qed system confined to a transverse harmonic trap or cavity . for simplicity , we take the spin @xmath68 leptons as massless .",
    "the basis functions are matched to the trap so we implement a transverse 2-d harmonic oscillator basis with length scale fixed by the trap and finite modes in the longitudinal direction with apbc .",
    "since we are ultimately interested in the self - bound states of the system , we anticipate adoption of the ncsm method for factorizing the eigensolutions into simple products of intrinsic and total momentum solutions in the transverse direction @xcite . that is , with a suitable transverse momentum constraint such as a large positive lagrange multiplier times the 2-d harmonic oscillator hamiltonian acting on the total transverse coordinates , the low - lying physical solutions will all have the same expectation value of total transverse momentum squared .",
    "therefore , following ref .",
    "@xcite we introduce the total invariant mass - squared @xmath69 for these low - lying physical states in terms of a hamiltonian @xmath70 times a dimensionless integer for the total light front momentum @xmath71    @xmath72    where we absorb the constant into @xmath69 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath70 for this system is defined by the sum of the occupied modes @xmath73 in each many - parton state with the scale set by the combined constant @xmath74 : @xmath75    we adopt symmetry constraints and two cutoffs for our many - parton states . for symmetries ,",
    "we fix the total charge @xmath76 , the total azimuthal quantum number @xmath77 , and the total spin projection @xmath59 along the @xmath20 direction . for cutoffs ,",
    "we select the total light - front momentum , @xmath71 , and the maximum total quanta allowed in the transverse mode of each many - parton state , @xmath3 . for the longitudinal modes , we select those with pbc from eq .",
    "[ eq : longitudinal1 ] .",
    "the chosen symmetries and cutoffs are expressed in terms of sums over the quantum numbers of the single - parton degrees of freedom contained in each many - parton state of the system in the following way :    @xmath78    where , for example , @xmath79 is the integer that defines the pbc longitudinal modes of eq .",
    "[ eq : longitudinal1 ] for the @xmath80 parton .",
    "the range of the number of fermion - antifermion pairs and bosons is limited by the cutoffs in the modes ( @xmath71 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "since each parton carries at least one unit of longitudinal momentum , the basis is limited to @xmath71 partons .",
    "furthermore , since each parton carries at least one oscillator quanta for transverse motion , the basis is also limited to @xmath3 partons .",
    "thus the combined limit on the number of partons is @xmath81 . in principle",
    ", one may elect to further truncate the many - parton basis by limiting the number of fermion - antifermion pairs and/or the number of bosons but we have not elected to do so here .",
    "we may refer to the quantity @xmath71 as the inverse longitudinal harmonic resolution .",
    "we reason that as we increase @xmath71 , higher longitudinal momenta states become available to the partons , thus allowing finer detail in the features of the longitudinal coordinate structure to emerge .    in a fully interacting application ,",
    "the actual choice of symmetry constraints will depend on those dictated by the hamiltonian .",
    "for example , with qcd we would add color and flavor attributes to the single particle states and apply additional symmetries such as requiring all many - parton states to be global color singlets as discussed below .",
    "another example , which we adopt for the interacting qed example below , is the choice to conserve total @xmath82 rather than conserving @xmath83 and @xmath59 separately .",
    "it is straightforward , but sometimes computationally challenging , to modify the symmetries in a basis function approach such as we adopt here .",
    "however , in order to approach the continuum limit ( all cutoffs are removed ) as closely as possible with limited computational resources , one works to implement as many of the known symmetries as possible .      for our defined non - interacting cavity mode problem",
    ", we now illustrate the exponential rise in basis - space dimensions with increasing @xmath3 at fixed @xmath71 , with increasing @xmath71 at fixed @xmath3 and with simultaneous increase in both cutoffs .",
    "the first two situations involve a parton number cutoff defined by @xmath71 and @xmath3 respectively .",

    "now we briefly address the interacting theory where a primary concern will be to manage the divergent structure of the theory .",
    "there are two possible locations for divergences in a hamiltonian basis function approach : ( 1 ) the matrix elements themselves diverge , or ( 2 ) the eigenvalues diverge as one or more cutoffs are removed .    in our cavity field theory applications with interactions ,",
    "we manage these divergences with the help of suitable counterterms , coupling constant and mass renormalizations , and boundary condition selections .",
    "the development of counterterms is expected to be straightforward as seen , for example , in ref .",
    "the infrared divergences in light - front momentum arising in both the fermion to fermion - boson vertex as well as in the instantaneous fermion - boson interaction are expected to be well - managed by previously defined counterterms @xcite suitably transcribed for the transverse basis functions we have adopted .",

    "finally , we expect the transverse ultraviolet divergences to be suitably - managed with our basis function selection . since we are introducing a basis - function approach for the transverse degrees of freedom , we need to investigate convergence rates with increased cutoff of the transverse modes @xmath3 . here ,",
    "in a simple set of examples , we outline how we can search for additional sources of divergence with the help of a perturbation theory analysis .",
    "consider the second order energy shift , @xmath129 , induced on a single parton in the transverse mode ( @xmath130 ) by its coupling @xmath131 to partons in higher energy transverse modes ( @xmath132 ) :    @xmath133    where we use the following notation and properties of the 2-d harmonic oscillator @xmath134 and we converted the sum to an integral taking the degeneracy into account with @xmath13 .    thus , according to perturbation theory , we expect a uv divergence if the matrix element falls off too slowly with increasing @xmath135 .",
    "in particular , if the matrix element falls approximately as @xmath136 , then we expect a logarithmic divergence since the integrand will have a net @xmath137 dependence .",
    "if the falloff is even slower then we encounter a more serious divergence .",
    "another possible source of a log divergence could arise within the selected sum over @xmath138 in which case @xmath13 , the level density factor in the integrand , is unity . then ,",
    "if the matrix elements for fixed @xmath139 are approximately constant with increasing @xmath138 , we again find a log divergence in the sum over @xmath138 .",

    "we further limit our presentation to the case where all partons remain in the orbital projection quantum number zero state and the 2-parton ( fermion - boson ) states have each parton in the same transverse state .",

    "when the single fermion state has an even value of the principal quantum number @xmath22 as shown in fig .",

    "we demonstrate anticipated good convergence with increasing @xmath22 by showing that the matrix elements , when multiplied by @xmath141 , still fall with increasing @xmath22 .    for the case when the single fermion state has an odd value of the principal quantum number @xmath22 as shown in fig .",
