    "we consider proteins with general energy landscapes  not necessarily funneled  and derive the conditions under which folding occurs reliably . generally , energy landscapes contain multiple minima , possibly separated by large energy barriers .",
    "thus folding is not necessarily an equilibrium process and misfolds can occur .",
    "below we consider the dynamics of the folding process and its effect on reliable folding .",
    "multiple minima in the energy landscape lead to multiple minima in the free energy . in this case",
    "we argue that there is a basic kinetic mechanism that determines whether folding is reliable .",
    "we illustrate this kinetic mechanism by considering a transition from state @xmath7 to state @xmath8 on a non - funneled energy landscape .",
    "although we will assume that the transition is driven by a reduction of temperature , the same arguments can be applied when a change of denaturant concentration or another parameter induces folding .    in fig .",

    "we will assume that a transition from @xmath10 is induced by decreasing the temperature at a constant rate @xmath0 such that @xmath11 as a function of time @xmath12 .",
    "initially at @xmath13 the protein resides in state @xmath7 . as temperature",

    "is further reduced to @xmath19 , the minimum corresponding to state @xmath7 no longer exists and the activation barrier @xmath20 grows .",
    "dynamics are important in determining transitions between states @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "if the time that it takes for the temperature to decrease from @xmath14 to @xmath17 is less than the folding time , the protein can fall into the metastable state @xmath18 .",
    "this sets a bound on @xmath0 : if @xmath21 then the protein is likely to populate the state @xmath18 .",
    "note that we use units where boltzmann s constant @xmath22 .",

    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     from these basic considerations it is apparent that protein folding transitions on non - funneled energy landscapes are influenced by multiple minima in the free energy and the rate @xmath0 at which external parameters are varied to induce folding . to determine whether reliable folding occurs",
    "we must address two important questions : ( i ) can the protein conformation reside in a metastable local minimum ? and ( ii )",
    "is it likely that the protein conformation becomes trapped in that local minimum ?",
    "the answers to these questions define the limiting rates @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the transition @xmath10 occurs reliably if @xmath0 obeys one of the inequalities , @xmath35 or @xmath36 . in the case that @xmath36 the protein",
    "is given sufficient time to sample all states and the transition @xmath10 occurs reliably as an equilibrium process .",
    "if @xmath37 the protein conformation becomes trapped in the state @xmath8 without fully exploring phase space and the transition occurs reliably , but out of equilibrium . if @xmath38 and @xmath39 then the protein does not transition between @xmath7 and @xmath8 reliably .      in the previous section we identified a kinetic mechanism that influences transitions on non - funneled landscapes . in this section",
    "we use this mechanism to formulate a general framework for understanding folding .",
    "we begin by partitioning the energy landscape into basins associated with particular protein topologies , proceed to define the free energy reaction path that describes how the protein transitions from one topology to another , and then use the kinetic mechanism described above to determine whether folding is reliable .    as a way to understand complex folding dynamics",
    ", the energy landscape of an arbitrary protein can be partitioned into basins surrounding each local minimum , analogous to the inherent structure formalism for liquids and glasses  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the infinite number of protein conformations can be uniquely associated with a finite number of topologies , defined as protein conformations that correspond to local minima of the internal energy .",
    "we denote a topology as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is an index that contains sufficient information to fully describe the conformation ( _ e.g. _ number , type and arrangement of bonds ) .",
    "the set of conformations @xmath42 associated with each topology @xmath40 is the basin of attraction for that topology .",
    "the basin of attraction is defined such that all conformations that belong to @xmath42 relax to the topology @xmath40 when thermal fluctuations of the protein are suppressed .",
    "thus the infinite number of possible protein conformations is represented by a finite number of topologies and a free energy @xmath43 can be defined for the set of protein conformations @xmath42 .",
    "formally the partition function @xmath44 for conformations constrained to lie in @xmath42 is given by @xmath45 where integration is over all coordinates @xmath46 in the basin @xmath42 and @xmath5 is the internal energy as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "the free energy for a protein constrained to @xmath42 can then be written in terms of the topology @xmath40 as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the internal energy of topology @xmath40 and @xmath49 is its associated entropy  @xcite , given by @xmath50/t \\right)\\ , d \\gamma .\\ ] ] the random coil state @xmath51 with zero internal energy has the largest entropy and is therefore the global minimum of free energy at sufficiently large temperature .",
    "given a protein with an energy landscape that has been partitioned into basins of attraction , we define the free energy reaction path as the ordered sequence of topologies that the protein adopts as temperature is reduced in the equilibrium limit .",
    "that is , if the rate @xmath0 is sufficiently small , the protein will come to equilibrium at all temperatures and proceed through the basins of attraction for a reproducible set of topologies @xmath52 .",
    "each transition occurs at the temperature where the free energy of two topologies is equal , _",
    "e.g. _ the transition @xmath53 occurs at the temperature @xmath54 where @xmath55 . in this way , for any energy landscape",
    ", the free energy reaction path encodes the path taken through conformation space when folding occurs as an equilibrium - quasistatic process .    to determine whether folding is reliable",
    ", we apply the analysis introduced in the previous section to each transition in the free energy reaction path .",
    "if we label the transitions by @xmath56 then limiting rates @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be determined for each transition by measuring properties of the free energy .",
    "there are then three distinct folding scenarios : ( 1 ) if @xmath59 for all @xmath60 then the protein does not become trapped in metastable conformations and folding occurs reliably in equilibrium ; ( 2 ) if @xmath61 for a single transition @xmath60 then the protein falls out of equilibrium at transition @xmath60 , but reliably folds to the topology @xmath62 ( since the condition @xmath63 guarantees that the protein does not fall into a different metastable state ) .",
    "note that if there exist multiple transitions with @xmath64 then the protein will reliably fold to the topology with the smallest value of @xmath65 for which this condition holds .",
    "finally , ( 3 ) if @xmath66 and @xmath67 for any @xmath60 , and condition ( 2 ) does not hold for a smaller value of @xmath60 , then the protein will not fold reliably .    from our analysis",
    "we deduce that there are two types of reliable folding , equilibrium and non - equilibrium .",
    "while reliable equilibrium folding brings the protein to the global minimum of free energy , reliable non - equilibrium folding can target local minima .",
    "the free energy reaction path provides a useful framework to classify the relevant transitions since , depending on the rate @xmath0 , a protein will either ( 1 ) pass through all topologies on the free energy reaction path and arrive at the topology with the smallest free energy , ( 2 ) target an intermediate topology along the free energy reaction path and reliably fold to a local minimum of free energy , or ( 3 ) misfold and deviate from the free energy reaction path .      to test the predictions of the previous section we perform off - lattice brownian dynamics simulations of a model protein with a single attractive energy scale .",
    "we model the protein as a polymer chain containing both attractive ( green ) and non - attractive ( white ) spherical monomers of size @xmath68 .",
    "interactions between non - adjacent green monomers are attractive with energy depth @xmath69 , while interactions between non - adjacent pairs of green - white or white - white monomers are purely repulsive .",

    "three energy minima exist and are separated by energy barriers .",
    "the minima correspond to three distinct topologies that are pictured in fig .",
    "[ energylandscape ] .",
    "we find a total of four relevant topologies for this simple system , containing either zero @xmath51 , three @xmath74 , four @xmath75 , or five @xmath76 bonds between attractive green monomers .",
    "energy barriers exist between @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 because , in order to transition between the topologies , it is necessary to first break a bond and then rearrange the chain conformation .",
    "note that four green particles is the minimum number needed to ensure multiple energy minima in two dimensions , while seven are required in three dimensions .",

    "the free energy reaction path theory predicts that reliable folding can occur on non - funneled landscapes and provides a means to quantitatively determine the limiting rate below which folding is reliable .",

    "levinthal was the first to realize that the exponential number of collapsed conformations preclude a protein from finding its native state via random sampling .",
    "the experimental observation that proteins fold reliably to a reproducible native state therefore requires an explanation .",
    "the modern view is that protein sequences have evolved to favor energy landscapes with a single funnel and can therefore fold reliably .",
    "we have demonstrated that proteins with non - funneled energy landscapes can also fold reliably , as long as the external parameters that induce folding are adjusted slowly enough .    we have identified two reliable folding processes on non - funneled landscapes : equilibrium and non - equilibrium . even though it is possible that in experimental and biological settings the rate at which external parameters are varied to induce folding",
    "is too large to access the equilibrium limit , reliable folding can occur out of equilibrium .",
    "if this is the case , the native state should be regarded as a reliably targeted local minimum on the free energy reaction path that remains metastable over timescales sufficient for biological function .",
    "the importance of the free energy reaction path and the necessity of using small rates to vary external parameters presents challenges for protein folding simulations .",
    "reliable protein folding is especially difficult to study in all - atom simulations where , due to the long time scales and large number of atoms , extremely rapid rates are used to induce folding  @xcite . from our results ,",
    "reliable folding on non - funneled landscapes depends on rate , thus simulation studies that argue that funneled energy landscapes are necessary for reliable folding  @xcite must be carefully interpreted if only large rates are considered .",
    "our predictions can be tested in experiments by studying folding over a range of rates , using methods such as ultrafast mixing or laser pulsing  @xcite .",
    "some progress has been made in this direction  @xcite and the observation of `` strange kinetics ''  @xcite after rapid temperature jumps is consistent with our predictions . in three dimensions",
    "the limiting rates are proportional to @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the hydrodynamic radius .",
    "this implies that investigating folding in a variety of solvents with different viscosities @xmath70 can greatly increase the range of experimentally accessible rates .",
    "moreover , due to the inverse dependence on @xmath1 , folding by changing temperature will give different limiting rates than folding by reducing denaturant concentration .",
    "finally , it is intriguing to speculate about folding _ in vivo_. given that the folded state of a protein is dependent on rate at which external parameters are varied to induce folding , and that local minima in free energy can be targeted by adjusting this rate , it is possible that protein sequence has evolved along with the biological environment in which it folds . since the folding process is determined by protein sequence and rate , both are likely used in nature to ensure robust folding .",

    "we include two types of monomers  attractive ( green ) and non - attractive ( white ) .",

    "<S> a theoretical framework is developed to study the dynamics of protein folding . </S>",
    "<S> the key insight is that the search for the native protein conformation is influenced by the rate @xmath0 at which external parameters , such as temperature , chemical denaturant or ph , are adjusted to induce folding . </S>",
    "<S> a theory based on this insight predicts that ( 1 ) proteins with non - funneled energy landscapes can fold reliably to their native state , ( 2 ) reliable folding can occur as an equilibrium or out - of - equilibrium process , and ( 3 ) reliable folding only occurs when the rate @xmath0 is below a limiting value , which can be calculated from measurements of the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> we test these predictions against numerical simulations of model proteins with a single energy scale .    under appropriate conditions , </S>",
    "<S> proteins spontaneously fold from an extended one - dimensional chain of amino acids to a unique three - dimensional native conformation . how this occurs on timescales accessible to experiment  and relevant to biological function  is a question that has intrigued scientists for the past forty years . </S>",
    "<S> levinthal  @xcite was the first to recognize the importance of timescales and point out that , assuming a random search of conformation space , proteins would not fold in a person s lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> this argument has come to be known as levinthal s paradox since proteins must fold for human life to exist in the first place .    of course </S>",
    "<S> conformation space is not sampled randomly and levinthal s paradox has been resolved by applying statistical mechanics to the protein folding problem  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each protein conformation has a free energy that determines its probability to be sampled at temperature @xmath1 . while the free energy @xmath2 generally comprises a sum of many enthalpic and entropic terms , it is convenient to express it as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the conformational entropy of only the protein degrees of freedom and @xmath5 is the `` internal energy '' that includes all other contributions to the free energy ( from both protein and solvent ) . </S>",
    "<S> the functional dependence of @xmath5 on all protein degrees of freedom is called the energy landscape  @xcite , which in general contains many minima . at @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> only the energy landscape is relevant and the protein resides in a local ( or global ) minimum , corresponding to a compact conformation . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath1 increases the conformational entropy smooths out the minima in the energy landscape and the protein adopts more extended states with larger @xmath4 . in the `` new view '' of protein folding  @xcite statistical fluctuations on an energy landscape </S>",
    "<S> give rise to an ensemble of folding pathways .    often associated with </S>",
    "<S> the new view is the hypothesis that energy landscapes have the shape of a multi - dimensional funnel  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> proponents argue that in order to fold reliably ( transition to the native state with probability one ) the energy landscape must contain a single low - lying minimum to which all conformations are channeled . </S>",
    "<S> if multiple funnels exist , separated by large enough energy barriers , then at low temperature or denaturant concentration a protein can become trapped in a local minimum of energy that does not correspond to its native conformation . while the existence of a single funnel is a sufficient condition for reliable protein folding , the number of proteins with a single funnel is expected to be small and the observation of kinetic traps  @xcite and glassy behavior  @xcite in biologically relevant proteins indicates that not all proteins fold on smooth funneled landscapes .    </S>",
    "<S> here we address the open question : is a funneled energy landscape necessary for reliable folding ? by formulating a statistical theory that includes the dynamics of folding , we find that a funneled landscape is not necessary for reliable folding . </S>",
    "<S> the important insight is that the rate @xmath0 at which temperature or chemical denaturant concentration is decreased to induce folding affects the final conformation of the protein . </S>",
    "<S> for sufficiently small @xmath0 the protein always folds to its native conformation , whereas for larger @xmath0 it can become trapped in a metastable state . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to new predictions that can be tested in experiments and simulations . </S>",
    "<S> first , proteins with non - funneled energy landscapes can fold reliably to their native state if the rate @xmath0 is below a limiting value . </S>",
    "<S> second , reliable folding can occur as an equilibrium - quasistatic or non - equilibrium process . </S>",
    "<S> third , in a non - equilibrium folding process , a protein can reliably fold to a local ( instead of global ) minimum of the energy landscape . </S>",
    "<S> we conduct off - lattice simulations of model proteins with non - funneled energy landscapes and verify these predictions . </S>"
