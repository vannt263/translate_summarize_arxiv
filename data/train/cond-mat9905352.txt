    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum spin systems have attracted much attention over the decades .",
    "this is not only because these systems have been a good testing ground for various theoretical techniques and approximations but also because they exhibit a wealth of fascinating phenomena in their ground states and low - lying excitations .",
    "these include quasi long - range - order ( lro ) , topological order and ground - state phase transitions , which are all purely quantum effects due to the low - dimensionality of the systems . among these quantum phenomena , the effects of randomness on quantum spin systems have been studied intensively by many groups .",
    "these studies revealed the appearance of various exotic phases , which are realized neither in regular quantum systems nor classical random systems .",
    "the interplay of randomness and quantum fluctuations plays an essential role in these phases .",
    "systems which are gapless in the absence of randomness are unstable against weak randomness,@xcite while gapped systems , e.g.  integer spin chains in the haldane phase and dimerized chains , are comparatively robust.@xcite    a simplest model of the 1d random spin-@xmath0 heisenberg spin systems is described by the hamiltonian of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 are @xmath5 spin operators and the exchange coupling constants @xmath6 are distributed randomly according to a probability distribution @xmath7 .",
    "there are several quasi-1d systems which provide the realizations of the model hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) .",
    "to our knowledge , the first example of such systems belongs to the class of the organic charge - transfer salts tetracyanoquinodimethanide ( tcnq).@xcite the low - temperature magnetic properties of these systems are successfully described by the model hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) with random antiferromagnetic ( af ) coupling,@xcite in which the couplings @xmath6 are restricted to take positive random values .",
    "a more recently studied system@xcite is sr@xmath8cupt@xmath9ir@xmath10o@xmath11 .",
    "while the pure compounds sr@xmath8cupto@xmath11 and sr@xmath8cuiro@xmath11 represent , respectively , af and ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin chains , sr@xmath8cupt@xmath9ir@xmath10o@xmath11 contains both af and fm couplings .",
    "the fraction of fm bonds is simply related to the concentration @xmath12 of ir .",
    "these compounds are modeled adequately by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the probability of fm bonds .",
    "the experimental data of the susceptibility of the compounds were in fact explained successfully by a theory based on the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) with the above probability distribution of fm and af bonds.@xcite the model ( [ eq : ham ] ) is also realized in the low - temperature regime of randomly depleted 1d spin-@xmath0 even - leg ladders.@xcite in these systems , effective @xmath5 spins are induced in the vicinity of each depleted site.@xcite if the density of depleted spins is sufficiently small , the induced effective spins are the only degrees of freedom which are active in the low - energy limit .",
    "the strength of the residual interaction between effective spins depends on the distance between the effective spins , and the coupling can be either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic , depending on whether or not two spins are depleted from the same sublattice .",
    "thus , the low - energy physics of the randomly depleted spin-@xmath0 even - leg ladders is described as a random spin chain with both af and fm exchange couplings.@xcite    for 1d random spin chains containing only af couplings , rather complete theoretical understanding on their low - energy properties has been achieved .",
    "one of the most powerful techniques to study such systems is the real - space renormalization group ( rsrg ) method introduced by ma , dasgupta , and hu.@xcite the basic idea of this method is iterative decimation of spin degrees of freedom by integrating out the strongest bonds in the chain successively . for the random af chains this procedure keeps the form of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) and renormalizes the probability distribution @xmath7 .",
    "fisher has given a solution to this rg equation of @xmath7 that becomes exact in the low - energy limit and shown that any normalizable initial distribution @xmath7 flows to a single universal fixed point distribution.@xcite the ground state of the chain which belongs to the fixed point is characterized by the `` random singlet phase , \" where each spin forms a singlet with another spin which can be arbitrarily far away . from the intuitive picture of the random singlet phase , fisher has also shown that the random average of the two - spin correlation function in this phase decays algebraically like @xmath1 with @xmath15 being the distance between the two spins .",
    "the main contribution to the average comes from the rare events that two spins separated by the distance @xmath15 form a singlet pair .",
    "the @xmath1 power - law decay has been verified by a numerical calculation for the random @xmath16 spin-@xmath0 chains,@xcite which can be mapped to a disordered system of noninteracting fermions .",
    "the random spin chains containing both af and fm couplings have also been studied theoretically for the last five years , from which a qualitative picture of the low - energy physics of such random fm - af chains has emerged .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have adapted the rsrg scheme and shown through extensive numerical simulations that the distribution @xmath7 is renormalized to a single universal fixed - point distribution unless the initial distribution is highly singular around @xmath17 .",
    "the chain at this fixed point can be viewed as an ensemble of weakly interacting large effective spins whose average size @xmath18 with @xmath19 for temperature @xmath20 .",
    "these large effective spins are generated as a result of decimations of two spins coupled via a strong fm coupling into a larger spin .",
    "the results of the rsrg simulations are supported by a recent calculation by frischmuth _",
    "et al_. ,  @xcite who have used the continuous - time quantum monte carlo loop algorithm .",
    "in contrast to the success in the quantitative calculations on the thermodynamic properties , less is known about the spin correlations in the random fm - af chains .",
    "since the average size of the effective spins becomes very large in the low - energy ( long - distance ) limit , one can expect that the system should be close to a classical spin chain that can show the lro of the generalized staggered spin component .",
    "one might also argue , however , that there should be no lro in 1d quantum spin chains .",
    "it is therefore an interesting open question how the correlation function of the generalized staggered moment ( whose definition will be given in sec .",
    "iii ) behaves in the ground state .",
    "the purpose of this paper is in fact to present results of our extensive numerical calculation of the two - spin correlation function .",
    "we find that it decays very slowly with the form close to @xmath2 , which is consistent with the naive argument that the ground state is extremely long - range correlated , but not really long - range ordered .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : conventionalrsrg ] is devoted to a brief review of the rsrg scheme of the generalized version which is applicable to both random af and fm - af case . using the wigner - eckart theorem,@xcite",
    "we simplify the algorithm to allow for calculating the two - spin correlation function between original @xmath21 spins . in section [ sec : extension ] , in order to achieve higher accuracy , we extended the rsrg scheme to take into account the contributions of local excitations to the ground state of the whole system .",
    "we perform these conventional and extended rsrg algorithm numerically on both random af and fm - af chains to calculate the `` staggered \" spin correlations on their ground states .",
    "the results on the random af case are shown in section [ sec : af ] . in section [ sec : fmaf ] , we show the results on the random fm - af case . analyzing the data obtained with the extended rsrg method ( which can be applied to larger systems than the dmrg ) ,",
    "we conclude that the mean correlations on the random fm - af case decay very slowly with logarithmic dependence on @xmath15 .",
    "we also discuss the distribution functions of the logarithm of the correlation functions in section [ sec : dis ] . we find that , in the random af case , the rare spin pairs , which are strongly correlated , dominate the mean correlation while such rare events are not essential in the random fm - af case .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "ma , dasgupta and hu introduced a rsrg procedure to investigate the low - temperature properties of random af spin chains.@xcite the method has been generalized to the random fm - af case by westerberg _",
    "et al_.@xcite in this section we explain our extension of this scheme to calculate the ground - state two - spin correlation functions .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the rsrg method for the random fm - af case .",
    "let us consider a random fm - af spin-@xmath0 chain described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) .",
    "the basic strategy of rsrg is to decimate spin degrees of freedom by combining two spins connected via a strong bond into one effective spin .",
    "consequently , the system is described in terms of effective spins of various sizes coupled by random exchange interactions , although the original hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) consists of only @xmath22 spins .",
    "we accordingly treat the effective hamiltonian , @xmath23 where both the coupling @xmath24 and the size of the effective spins @xmath25 are random .",
    "we call the @xmath22 spins @xmath4 appearing in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) `` original \" spins in the following to distinguish them from the effective spins @xmath26 .",
    "we define @xmath27 as the energy gap between the ground - state multiplet and the first excited multiplet of the corresponding bond hamiltonian @xmath28 , @xmath29 and focus on the bond with the largest gap @xmath27 in the chain . the terms in the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : heff ] ) which involve the effective spins @xmath26 and @xmath30 are @xmath31 where @xmath32",
    "if @xmath27 is much larger than the gaps of the neighboring bonds , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the spins @xmath26 and @xmath30 , to a good approximation , are frozen into the ground - state multiplet of the local hamiltonian @xmath35 .",
    "we , therefore , replace the block composed of @xmath26 and @xmath30 by the single effective spin @xmath36 .",
    "the wigner - eckart theorem  @xcite then implies that both @xmath26 and @xmath30 are proportional to @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be obtained from the clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : we ] ) into the four - spin hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) , we obtain , apart from a constant term coming from @xmath35 , @xmath40 where @xmath41 the case where @xmath24 is antiferromagnetic with @xmath42 needs a special treatment . in this case the two spins @xmath26 and @xmath30 form a singlet , and accordingly , we remove both spins from the effective hamiltonian . between the spins @xmath43 and @xmath44 ,",
    "a coupling is generated through a second - order process that virtually breaks the singlet of @xmath26 and @xmath30 .",
    "we obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46    by replacing the four - spin hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) with @xmath47 [ eq .  ( [ eq : hnew ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eq : hnew ] ) ] in the hamiltonian of the whole system , we obtain a new effective hamiltonian ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : conrsrg ] ) .",
    "we note that this procedure preserves the form of the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : heff ] ) but changes the distributions of the exchange couplings , @xmath24 , and the size of effective spins , @xmath25 .",
    "we repeat this procedure of integrating out the strongest bonds in a chain successively until the distribution functions for @xmath24 and @xmath25 converge to a scaling form .",
    "this rg flow has been investigated extensively for various initial distributions including both af and fm - af case .",
    "@xcite in particular , for the random af @xmath22 chains fisher has solved the rg equation exactly .",
    "@xcite    it is also possible to calculate the correlation functions between original spins within the scheme described above .",
    "here we make use of the fact that the original spin operator @xmath4 is , at every step in the rsrg procedure , proportional to the effective spin @xmath26 to which it belongs .",
    "we can keep track of the coefficient for each original spin operator by applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : we ] ) at each step . at the step",
    "where the effective spins @xmath26 and @xmath30 is added into @xmath36 , we calculate the correlations between @xmath4 and @xmath48 in the ground state of the bond hamiltonian @xmath35 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the expectation value in the ground state ; @xmath4 and @xmath48 belong to @xmath26 and @xmath30 , respectively ; @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the proportionality coefficients for each spin .",
    "as seen in the previous subsection , the conventional rsrg procedure consists of `` diagonalizing the bond hamiltonian with the largest gap `` and `` projecting the low - energy states onto the lowest multiplet . ''",
    "this means that we completely neglect the contribution of the excited multiplets of the local hamiltonian ( [ eq : h0 ] ) to the ground state of the whole system .",
    "this approximation is valid only if the energy gap of @xmath35 is much larger than the ones of the neighboring bonds .",
    "fisher s solution for the random af @xmath22 chain becomes asymptotically exact since this condition is satisfied near the fixed point of the rg flow .",
    "however , the condition is often not satisfied , in particular , in the early stage of the rg , unless the initial distribution of energy gap is very broad . as a result",
    ", we have no choice but to cut off the contributions of local excitations .",
    "this is a poor approximation that has a serious effect especially on the calculation of the expectation values of microscopic operators such as the original spins .",
    "the ground - state correlation functions between original spins calculated via the conventional rsrg in fact deviate largely from those obtained from the dmrg method and the extended rsrg algorithm described below ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : afc ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fmc ] in section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "one possible prescription to avoid this error is `` to keep the local multiplet excitations \" at each step .",
    "of course , if we keep all eigenstates of the bond hamiltonian @xmath35 at every step of the rg , the calculation on @xmath35 in the final step is equivalent to the exact diagonalization on the hamiltonian of the whole system . in practice",
    "what we should do is to extend the rsrg algorithm under the policy that we keep as many states as we can store in computer memories . in the original rsrg scheme a segment of original spins",
    "are combined and represented by a single effective spin . in the extended scheme",
    "we keep more states than the lowest multiplet and call the segment a ` block. each block consists of several original spins and is represented by ` block states, which are the @xmath53-lowest eigenstates of the block hamiltonian .",
    "since we have to keep or discard all states of a multiplet to ensure the su(2 ) symmetry , the actual number of kept states for block @xmath54 is @xmath55 .",
    "an original spin operator in block @xmath54 is represented by @xmath56 matrix on the set of the block states accordingly .",
    "let us consider the effective hamiltonian @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a block hamiltonian of the @xmath54th block , diagonal in the block states ; @xmath59 is a coupling hamiltonian between the @xmath54th and @xmath60th blocks ; @xmath61 and @xmath62 are original spin operators on the right and left edge of the @xmath54th block , respectively ; @xmath63 is a coupling between @xmath61 and @xmath64 . in the extended rsrg scheme we renormalize the two - block hamiltonian @xmath65 with the largest gap @xmath27 into one block hamiltonian ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : extrsrg ] ) . here",
    "we define @xmath27 as the energy difference between the highest energy in the eigen - multiplets of @xmath66 which will be kept and the lowest energy in the multiplets which will be discarded after the decimation .",
    "the basic scheme of the extended rsrg is the same as the conventional rsrg except the changes described above .",
    "the algorithm is summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "focus on the bond with the largest gap @xmath27 .",
    "construct the two - block hamiltonian ( [ eq:2bh ] ) of the bond .",
    "2 .   diagonalize the two - block hamiltonian to find a set of eigenvalues and eigenstates .",
    "at this point , we can calculate expectation values of various operators in the two blocks , such as the two - spin correlation functions between the original spins , using the ground state of the two - block hamiltonian .",
    "3 .   discard all but the lowest @xmath67 eigenstates in the block hamiltonian .",
    "4 .   express operators , such as the block hamiltonian itself and the original spin operators in the new block , in terms of the new block states .",
    "rewrite the coupling hamiltonians between the new block and its neighboring blocks in terms of the new @xmath68 and @xmath69 . diagonalize them to update the distribution of the energy gap @xmath70 .",
    "return to the step ( i ) .",
    "we obtain all two - spin correlation functions by repeating this procedure until the whole chain is finally represented by one block .",
    "using both the conventional rsrg and the extended rsrg with various values of @xmath53 , we calculated the correlation functions @xmath71 in the ground state of open chains for both the random af case and the random fm - af case .",
    "the maximum size of the chains used for the conventional and the extended rsrg simulations is @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively . in the fm - af case ,",
    "the random average of the spin correlation , @xmath71 , always decays exponentially@xcite and is not an appropriate quantity to characterize the spin correlation because the sign of @xmath71 can be either positive or negative depending on the number of af bonds between @xmath4 and @xmath48 .",
    "instead we introduce the `` generalized staggered \" correlation function @xmath74 where @xmath75 for @xmath76 . for random af case , @xmath77 is the usual staggered spin correlation .",
    "we take the random average of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which represents the mean correlations and the logarithm of the typical correlations , respectively .",
    "note that it is impossible to take the random average of @xmath78 numerically in the conventional rsrg algorithm , within which @xmath79 for two spins that do not form a singlet pair . to check the results of the rsrg methods",
    ", we also calculated the correlation functions on @xmath80 open chains using the dmrg method  @xcite with the improved algorithm proposed by white .",
    "@xcite the number of kept states in the dmrg calculation was up to 100 and 200 for the random af and fm - af case , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the mean and typical correlations calculated by the extended rsrg are in excellent agreement with those by dmrg ( see below ) .",
    "we note that the systems we have treated are much bigger than those in the earlier work by hida,@xcite in which the dmrg method is applied for the fm - af chains .      as a typical probability distribution of the random af case ,",

    ", it is known that any normalizable initial distribution flows to a single universal fixed point .",
    "@xcite hence , the results we obtained for the initial distribution ( [ p(j);af ] ) are generic .",
    "the number of sample chains we used for each method are shown in table [ tb1 ] .    before discussing our numerical results , we briefly comment on the @xmath53-dependence of the data of the extended rsrg . as noted in the last section",
    ", the extended rsrg can provide more accurate results as the number of kept states , @xmath53 , increases . in the random af case ,",
    "the ground - state multiplet of a block hamiltonian is either singlet or doublet , depending on the number of original spins belonging to the block .",
    "the degeneracy of each low - lying excited multiplet is , therefore , always small . as a result",
    ", we can keep considerably many multiplets even if @xmath53 is rather small .",
    "we estimate the @xmath53-dependence of the results of the extended rsrg from the numerical data with @xmath83 .",

    "we conclude from these observations that the results of the extended rsrg are quantitatively reliable , whereas the conventional rsrg can be used to estimate the exponent of the power - law decay .",
    "encouraged by the agreement between the extended rsrg and the dmrg data , we anticipate that the extended rsrg provide quantitatively reliable data even for @xmath90 where the reliable dmrg data are not available . from the data of the extended rsrg with @xmath91 for @xmath92 , where the data are expected not to be hampered by finite - size effects",
    ", we estimate the asymptotic form of the average correlations to be @xmath93 for the average of @xmath78 , we also rely on the data obtained from the extended rsrg scheme .",
    "figure [ fig : aflnc ] gives @xmath94 both results ( [ eq : fs1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fs2 ] ) agree with fisher s theory  @xcite and can be considered as a numerical verification of his solution on the mean and typical correlations for the heisenberg case .",
    "for the random @xmath16 chains@xcite and for a related model of the random transverse - field ising model,@xcite the power - law behavior ( [ eq : fs1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fs2 ] ) is observed numerically . to our knowledge ,",

    "we investigate the spin correlations at this fixed point with the extended rsrg scheme . for this purpose",
    "we assume the box - type bond distribution @xmath7 , @xmath97 with @xmath82 as energy unit , as a representative of distributions with no singularity at @xmath98 .",
    "we expect that our results obtained for the initial distribution ( [ eq : p ] ) should capture the universal behavior for the random fm - af chains which are in the basin of the universal fixed point found in ref .  .",

    "in fact , we could complete the extended rsrg procedure without exceeding the limit of the number of kept states @xmath87 ( @xmath100 ) for 30% ( 75% ) of the sample chains ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "we then used only those samples for which the rsrg could be completed to take the random average .",

    "[ fig : fsc ] as a fixed - point form of the distribution function .",
    "figure  [ fig : fsc ] clearly shows that the distribution function of the random fm - af chains has a quite different form from that of the random af chains .",
    "it is essentially zero for @xmath137 and increases approximately linearly at @xmath138 . the weight function @xmath125 representing the contribution to the mean correlation is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsc ] .",
    "in contrast to the random af case , @xmath125 has most of its weight in the region where @xmath114 is not negligible .",
    "this feature highlights the different nature of the spin correlations in the random fm - af chains .",
    "as shown in the rsrg analysis , many spins in the random fm - af chains correlate and form a large effective spin .",
    "this suggests that a spin is correlated with many other spins that belong to the same large effective spin , and , therefore , the mean value of the spin correlation function is not at all dominated by the `` rare  events that two spins , far apart from each other , form a singlet pair .    from the observation that @xmath136 of the random fm - af chains is negligible for @xmath139 ( @xmath140 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsc ] ) and has an approximately linear dependence for @xmath141 until it takes a maximum value , we can also draw a conclusion that @xmath142 and @xmath143 should have a similar dependence on @xmath15 , in agreement with figs .",
    "[ fig : fmc ] and [ fig : fmlnc ] .",
    "let us assume that the scaling function has the form @xmath144 where @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 are positive constants . since @xmath148 in the limit @xmath129 , the mean correlation @xmath102 is dominated by the contribution from the region of small @xmath149 .",
    "thus , we are allowed to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) for calculating @xmath102 , even though this form is not correct for large @xmath149 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : scl ] ) ,  ( [ eq : scl1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : f ] ) , we calculate the mean correlation : @xmath150 ^ 2 } e^{-a g(r)},\\ ] ] yielding @xmath151 in the limit @xmath152 .",
    "this result is in agreement with our observation that the curves in figs .",
    "[ fig : fmc ] and [ fig : fmlnc ] look very similar .",
    "it is also consistent with the fact that @xmath125 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsc ] stays almost in the same region of @xmath126 with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ln = ln ] ) is not changed qualitatively even when @xmath153 has an algebraic form @xmath154^\\alpha$ ] , as far as @xmath155 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : ln = ln ] ) does not hold in the random af chains , for which we should take @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "we have studied the spin correlations in spin-@xmath0 random heisenberg chains for both the random af and the random fm - af case .",
    "one of the most powerful methods for the study of random spin chains is the real - space rg in which the spin degrees of freedom are decimated by integrating out the strongest bonds successively . in order to calculate the two - spin correlation functions between original @xmath21 spins",
    ", we modified the algorithm of the conventional rsrg using the wigner - eckart theorem .",
    "we also extended the rsrg scheme by keeping the local excited multiplets as block states to keep track of quantum effects .",
    "we demonstrated that the extended rsrg algorithm is very powerful , in the sense that it can be applied to rather large systems , and provides accurate numerical data that are in excellent agreement with those of the dmrg method .",
    "the numerical data of the mean and typical correlations for the random af chains verified fisher s prediction [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fs1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fs2 ] ) ] for the heisenberg case , which can not be mapped to noninteracting fermions . for the random fm - af chains",
    ", we found that the mean correlation , @xmath102 , decays very slowly with the logarithmic @xmath15-dependence .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that the generalized staggered spin correlation in the random fm - af chains has no lro , although it shows very long - range correlations decaying slower than power - law behavior .",
    "investigating the distribution of the logarithm of the spin correlation functions , we also clarified the different nature of the ground states of the random af and fm - af chains . in both cases , our data of distributions",
    "satisfy the scaling hypothesis , eq .",
    "( [ eq : scl ] ) . analyzing the form of the scaling function",
    ", we found that the `` rare spin pairs `` , which are correlated much stronger than typical ones , dominate the mean correlation @xmath102 in the random af case .",
    "it is also shown that the @xmath15-dependence of the mean correlations in this case is quite different from that of the typical ones .",
    "these features strongly support the fact that the `` random singlet phase '' is realized in the ground state of the random af heisenberg chains . on the other hand ,",
    "the scaling form of the distribution functions for the random fm - af chains suggests that such `` rare spin pairs \" do not play an important role in these chains .",
    "we also deduced that @xmath158 and @xmath85 have very similar @xmath15-dependence , using the scaling hypothesis and the specific feature of the scaling function we obtained numerically .",
    "this result is non - trivial and consistent with our numerical data ( figs .",
