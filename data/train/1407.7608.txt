    "the chiral u(1 ) anomaly has been derived by calculating some feynman triangle diagrams of fermions in four - dimensional quantum electrodynamics  @xcite and is studied in quantum field theory because it is a fruitful topic . the anomaly is obtained from the chiral transformation of the euclidean path integral measure for gauge theories with fermions  @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the anomalous axial - vector ward - takahashi identities in the method has attracted some attention  @xcite .",
    "the anomaly is related to the chiral magnetic effect and topological insulators in condensed matter physics  @xcite .    in quantum field theory ,",
    "several fermionic loop corrections are perturbatively described by a fermion propagator with a background field .",
    "the chiral u(1 ) anomaly in four - dimensional curved space  @xcite has been obtained using the heat kernel  @xcite , by which the propagator should be given . some anomalies for chiral fermions interacting with gauge fields in higher even - dimensional curved space",
    "can be calculated using this method .",
    "the chiral u(1 ) anomaly in 6 dimensions has topologically similar features to that in 10 dimensions because of the index theorem  @xcite .    in @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath2 supergravity  @xcite , the rarita - schwinger field @xmath3 describes a gravitino by fixing a gauge suitably , and the evaluation of the anomalies requires the heat kernel for a fermion with spin @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "however , by regarding the vector index `` @xmath5 '' of @xmath3 as that of the representation matrices of gauge group so(10 ) , the heat kernel for a spinor with spin @xmath4 can be expressed by that for a spinor with spin @xmath0 . moreover ,",
    "the lagrangian in the supergravity contains not only the minimal interaction between the gravitino and the gravitational fields but also four - gravitino interactions . in the fermionic one - loop diagram ,",
    "the four - gravitino vertex is connected by two internal and two external lines .",
    "then , by regarding the two fermion external lines as a boson line , the four - gravitino interaction is treated as two - gravitino interactions with bosonic background fields , which are odd - order tensors .",
    "the totally antisymmetric tensor of the highest order @xmath6 in even @xmath7 dimensions is rewritten as the axial - vector by contracting the levi - civita symbol with its tensor .",
    "a fermion on which the projection matrix @xmath8 acts is expressed by the weyl spinor with either positive or negative chirality , which corresponds to an eigenstate with right- or left - handed helicity in massless fermions , respectively . in the dirac operator of the weyl fermion , the gauge fields are separated into two types of boson by the projection .",
    "however , we must note the hermiticity of the bosonic coupling in the dirac operator @xmath9 because , to evaluate the correctness of the result of the anomaly , it is necessary to calculate by replacing @xmath10 with @xmath11 ; if the dirac operator is not hermitian , @xmath12 .",

    "the chiral u(1 ) anomaly for the weyl fermion is half of that for the dirac fermion , up to the sign of the chirality of the weyl fermion .",
