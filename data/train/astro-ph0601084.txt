    "as an interacting galaxy system , stephan s quintet ( hereafter sq ) is not as famous as arp  220 or m82 . taken as a popularity index , the number of references listed by ned ( until dec .",
    "18th , 2005 ) under stephan s quintet is only 104 , far less than that under m82 ( 1355 ) and arp  220 ( 563 ) .",
    "however , its fame as a very special case of multi - galaxy collision has been rising steadily recently , thanks mostly to the ever increasing number of observational windows opened one after another in this space astronomy era .",
    "sq has been observed in almost all wavebands , and it keeps revealing surprises when being looked at by new instruments .",
    "different from binary galaxies and mergers which have been thoroughly discussed elsewhere in this conference , sq belongs to a different class of interacting systems of galaxies : the compact groups ( hickson  @xcite ) that are characterized by aggregates of 4  8 galaxies in implied space densities as high as those in cluster cores .",
    "sq is unique among its peers because a seemingly very rare event is occurring to it : a high velocity ( @xmath0 km sec@xmath1 ) intruder is colliding into a debris field in the intragroup medium ( igm ) , the latter being a product of previous interactions among other member galaxies of the group . the complex web of galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - igm interactions have triggered all kinds of interaction related phenomena , including a large scale shock ( @xmath2 kpc ) , an igm starburst , long tidal tails ( @xmath3 kpc ) with tidal dwarf candidates , and a highly obscured type ii agn .    in this talk i ll review the rich literature on the multi - frequency observations of sq and the constraints imposed on its interaction history and on its current star formation rate .",
    "i ll also high light its role as a laboratory to study rare phenomena such as large scale shocks and high velocity collision induced starbursts .",
    "inferences from these studies to the understanding of local ulirgs and high z galaxies will be briefly touched .",
    "sq ( fig.1 ) was discovered as an aggregation of nebulae by stephan in late 19th century ( stephan  @xcite ) , much earlier than anyone knew galaxies outside the milky way exist .",
    "it raised strong interest in early years of modern astronomy because of its wide range of redshifts ( ambartsumian  @xcite ; limber & mathews  @xcite ; burbidge & burbidge  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , arp(@xcite,@xcite ) argued that ngc  7320 , with a redshift about 5000 km sec@xmath1 less than the rest of the group ( burbidge & burbidge  @xcite ) , is physically associated with other sq galaxies and is a prime case for the existence of non - dopler redshift .",
    "the counter arguments against this claim include ( allen & sullivan  @xcite ; moles et al .",
    "@xcite ) : ( 1 ) no evidence for interaction with other sq galaxies was found in the hi or in the h@xmath4 emission associated with ngc  7320 . ( 2 ) results from redshift independent estimators yielded distances consistent with the redshifts . (",
    "3 ) apparently ngc  7320 is a member of a foreground loose galaxy group which includes the large galaxy ngc  7331 at redshift @xmath5 km sec@xmath1 .",
    "i shall assume that ngc  7320 is a foreground galaxy and omit it hereafter .",
    "arp ( @xcite ) suggested that ngc  7320c , a galaxy about 4 to the east of ngc  7319 and linked to the group by optical tidal tails , should be included into sq .",
    "therefore , dropping ngc  7320 and at same time picking up ngc  7320c , sq still consists of five galaxies as implied by the name .",
    "the early deep optical images ( arp & kormendy  @xcite ; arp  @xcite ; arp & lorre  @xcite ) show clearly two concentrating parallel tidal tails , both starting from ngc  7319 and extending to ngc  7320c , with the more diffuse one passing through the low redshift galaxy ngc  7320 .",
    "however , contemplations on the interaction history of sq started only after two discoveries in the radio band , both made with the westerbork synthesis telescope .",
    "the first is a huge ( @xmath2 kpc ) radio continuum ridge found in the igm between ngc  7319 and ngc  7318b ( allen & hartsuiker  @xcite ) . among other possible interpretations , allen & hartsuiker suggested",
    "this may be a large scale shock triggered by an on - going collision between ngc  7318b and the rest of the group .",
    "the second ( allen & sullivan  @xcite ; shostak et al .",
    "@xcite ) is the revelation that nearly all hi gas associated with sq , amounting to @xmath6 m@xmath7 , is in the igm outside galaxy disks .",
    "it is suggested that this is stripped gas from late type galaxy disks due to an earlier interaction ( a few 10@xmath8 yr ago ) either between ngc  7319 and ngc  7318a ( allen & sullivan  @xcite ) , or between ngc  7319 and ngc  7320c ( shostak et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "mole et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter m97 ) put up a comprehensive picture for the interaction history of sq based on a two - intruders scenario ( see also sulentic et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter s01 ) : an old intruder ( ngc  7320c ) stripped most of the gas from group members , and a new intruder ( ngc  7318b ) is currently colliding with this gas and triggering the large scale shock .",
    "the old intruder passed the core of sq twice , one in @xmath9  7 @xmath10 yr ago and pulled out the ` old tail ' , another about 2 @xmath10 yr ago and triggered the ` young tail ' ( the narrower one ) .",
    "recently , xu et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter x05 ) proposed a three - intruders scenario based on new observations .",
    "they agreed with m97 on the origins of the old tail and of the shock .",
    "but , different from m97 , they argued that it is unlikely that the young tail is also triggered by ngc  7320c .",
    "this is because the recently measured redshift of ngc  7320c ( 6583 km sec@xmath1 , s01 ) is almost identical to that of ngc  7319 , indicating a slow passage ( s01 ) rather than a fast passage ( @xmath11 km sec@xmath1 , m97 ) . in order for ngc  7320c to move to its current position ,",
    "the ngc  7319/7320c encounter must have occurred @xmath12 yr ago .",
    "this is close to the age of the old tail , but older than that of the young tail .",
    "they suggested that the young tail is triggered by a close encounter between the elliptical galaxy ngc  7318a and ngc  7319 .",
    "the projected distance between ngc  7318a/7319 is only @xmath13 of that between ngc  7320c/7319 .",
    "therefore the time argument is in favor of the new scenario .",
    "also the morphology of the young tail revealed by the new uv observations , relative to ngc  7319 and ngc  7318a , looks very similar to the counter tidal tail found in dynamic simulations of equal mass galaxy - galaxy interactions ( see , e.g. , fig.2 of toomre & toomre  @xcite , t=2 10@xmath8 yr ) . according to the k - band luminosities , ngc  7318a and ngc  7319 have nearly identical stellar mass .",
    "moles et al .",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) concluded that the disk of ngc  7318b is still intact because the time since it starts to interact with the group is too short ( @xmath14 yr ) for any tidal effect .",
    "however , xu et al . ( @xcite ; @xcite ) speculated that the galaxy might have had a head - on collision with ngc  7318a @xmath15 yr ago , which means ngc  7318a must be @xmath16 kpc further away than ngc  7318b given the velocity difference .",
    "this will help to explain the long outer arms ( looking like tidal tails ) , the peculiar hi gas distribution ( all outside the optical disk ) and the huge uv disk ( @xmath17 kpc ) of the ngc  7318b . also , in this scenario , the comma - like filaments in the region north of ngc7318 ( see , e.g. fig.1c of mendes de olivera et al .",
    "@xcite ) can be interpreted in an analogy to the spoke - like filaments in the cartwheel galaxy , a prototype ring galaxy produced in a head - on galaxy - galaxy collision ( higdon  @xcite ) .",
    "the only sign for any interaction between ngc  7317 with other members of sq is a common halo linking it to the binary ngc  7318 , found in the deep x - ray and optical r - band images ( trinchieri et al .",
    "since the discovery of allen & hartsuiker ( @xcite ) , the large scale radio ridge has been confirmed by later vla observations ( van der hulst & rots  @xcite ; williams et al .",

    "the optical spectroscopy of xu et al .",
    "( @xcite ) at several positions along the ridge show spectra consistent with shock excitation .",
    "this shock is truly unique to sq .",
    "its size is second only to that of the radio relics caused by cluster mergers ( enlin & brggen  @xcite ) . in the shock ,",
    "the intruder / igm collision could have deposited as much as 10@xmath18 erg energy , equivalent to the kinematic energy of @xmath19 supernovae . using the formula of dopita & sutherland ( @xcite ) , xu et al .",
    "( @xcite ) derived a total energy flux in the form of @xmath20 .",
    "apparently , most of this flux comes out in the fir band .",
    "based on iso observations , the total dust luminosity of the shock front is @xmath21 .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude higher than the x - ray luminosity ( trinchieri et al .",
    "@xcite ) , indicating that the hot gas is predominantly cooled by collisions with dust grains .",
    "trinchieri et al .",
    "( @xcite ) estimated the shock velocity to be 460 km sec@xmath1 , and the density of post - shock gas @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding sputtering time scale for @xmath24 grains is 3.7 @xmath25 yr , compared to the cooling time scale of 2.1 @xmath25 yr . hence the grains can indeed survive the shock long enough to be the major coolant . the energy density of relativistic particles plus the magnetic fields , derived from the minimum energy assumption , is @xmath26 erg  @xmath23 ( xu et al .",
    "this is significantly lower than the total energy density implied by the total energy flux , so the magnetic field may be dynamically insignificant for the shock .",
    "recently , using spitzer , appleton et al .",
    "( @xcite ) discovered strong mid - ir emission lines of molecular hydrogen ( and little else ! ) at position of one of the radio emission peaks along the shock .",
    "the derived h@xmath27 luminosity is much higher than @xmath28 and only a factor of @xmath29 less than l@xmath30 .",
    "this gives support to the idea ( rieke et al .",
    "@xcite ) that the strong mir h@xmath27 lines often detected in luminous ir galaxies are primarily excited by shock waves .",
    "the star formation activity in sq is apparently very much influenced by interactions .",
    "the most spectacular star formation region in sq is the igm starburst sq - a , which is associated with a bright mir ( 15@xmath31 ) source ( xu et al .",
    "@xcite ) just beyond the northern tip of the shock front .",
    "the two velocity components of the starburst have same redshifts as those of the neutural gas , indicating that the starburst is occurring in the pre - shock gas .",
    "the estimated star formation rate ( sfr ) is 1.45 m@xmath7/yr , and the age is @xmath14 yr . xu et al .",
    "( @xcite ) advocated a scenario in which the starburst is triggered due to squeezing of pre - existing giant - molecular clouds ( gmcs ) by post - shock hi gas , as depicted in the model of jog & solomon ( @xcite ) .",
    "the young tail is also active in star formation .",
    "hunsberger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found 13 tidal dwarf galaxy candidates along this tail .",
    "a bright star formation region ( sq - b ) is detected in both h@xmath4 ( arp  @xcite ) and mir ( xu et al .",
    "several discrete star formation regions near the western tip of the tail are found in both h@xmath4 ( s01 ; mendes de oliveira et al .",

    "( @xcite ) , iglesias - pramo & vilchez ( @xcite ) , and mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "( @xcite ) classified them as tidal dwarf galaxy candidates , though s01 argued that the crossing time of ngc  7318b ( @xmath14 yr ) is too short for any tidal effects .",
    "investigations based on optical colors ( schombert et al .",
    "@xcite ; gallagher et al .",
    "@xcite ) and uv colors ( x05 ) indicate several distinct epochs of star formation that appear to trace the history of dynamic interactions in sq . using the @xmath32 luminosity without correction for internal extinction ,",
    "the results of iglesias - pramo & vilchez ( @xcite ) give a rather low net sfr of @xmath33 m@xmath7/yr for the whole group .",
    "the extinction corrected fuv ( galex ) luminosities , with internal extinction constrained by the iso mir flux and the hi surface density , yield a net sfr of 6.7@xmath34 m@xmath7/yr ( x05 ) .",
    "the sfr of the two sbc galaxies , ngc  7318b and 7319 , is consistent with that of normal sbc galaxies such as the milky way , confirming the general conclusion that late type galaxies in compact groups have their sfr indistinguishable from that of their field counterparts ( sulentic & de mello rabaca  @xcite ; moles et al .",
    "@xcite ; iglesias - pramo & vilchez  @xcite ) .",
    "this is in strong contrast with galaxy pairs where significant enhancement of star formation is very common .",
    "* hi gas : * first noticed by allen & sullivan ( @xcite ) , and confirmed by later observations ( shostak et al .  @xcite ; w02 ) , all of the hi in sq is in the igm outside galaxy disks .",
    "w02 found the gas is located in five features : ( 1 ) arc - s ( 6641 km sec@xmath1 , 2.5 10@xmath35 m@xmath7 ) associated with the old optical tail , ( 2 ) arc - n ( 6604 km sec@xmath1 , 4.0 10@xmath35 m@xmath7 ) associated with the young tail , ( 3 ) nw - lv ( 6012 km sec@xmath1 , 2.2 10@xmath35 m@xmath7 ) and ( 4 ) nw - hv ( 6647 km sec@xmath1 , 0.9 10@xmath35 m@xmath7 ) both centered at the position of the igm starburst sq - a , and ( 5 ) sw ( 5699 km sec@xmath1 , 1.5 10@xmath35 m@xmath7 ) in the south of ngc  7318b .",
