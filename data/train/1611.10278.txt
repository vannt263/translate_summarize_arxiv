    "the purpose of this article is to study kodaira dimensions of log - pairs determined by elements of the brauer group @xmath8 of @xmath2 the function field of @xmath3 an integral normal projective variety defined over an algebraically closed field @xmath9 .",

    "more specifically , in  [ embeddings : div : alg : ramification : formulas ] , we consider questions related to the iitaka - kodaira-@xmath13-dimension , which we denote by @xmath4 and define in definition [ iitaka : brauer : defn ] , of such a pair @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the behaviour and invariance of @xmath4 in certain natural geometric and algebraic situations .    for more precise statements , in  [ ram : calc ]",
    ", we first study embeddings @xmath14 of division algebras @xmath15 and @xmath16 with centre the field of fractions of a discrete valuation ring and completions thereof . in this direction",
    ", we establish theorem [ embedding : divide : theorem ] which shows that the ramification of @xmath15 is at most the ramification of @xmath16 .    our first result globalizes theorem [ embedding : divide : theorem ] . to state it ,",

    "the main point here is that the @xmath37-divisor @xmath42 sees the ramification of @xmath11 that comes from prime divisors of @xmath3 as well as the ramification of @xmath11 that comes from prime divisors which have centre some object @xmath43 . indeed ,",
    "given such a proper model @xmath43 of @xmath2 , we let @xmath44 denote the ramification divisor on @xmath45 that it determines .    in this setting , we prove the following result , in  [ b - div : brauer ] , which pertains to birational invariance of kodaira dimension for @xmath7-gorenstein pairs :    [ brauer : iitakacanonical : singulatiries : main : result ] suppose that @xmath46 is a @xmath7-gorenstein canonical pair .",

    "this is the content of theorem [ brauer - r - h ] and in order to prove that result , we first establish , in  [ maximal : orders : dvr : extensions ] , some auxiliary results which pertain to maximal orders and extensions of discrete valuation rings .    to place our results obtained here into their proper context",

    "using the artin - mumford sequence , @xcite , the authors define ramification data and log pairs determined by such brauer classes .",
    "further , they establish a minimal model program for such pairs . here , by contrast , we use structure theory of hereditary orders over complete discrete valuation rings to define ramification data .    as some additional comments , related to theorem [ brauer : iitakacanonical : singulatiries : main : result ] and the birational geometry of brauer pairs for instance , we should also mention that we do not attempt to address the question of existence of canonical @xmath7-gorenstein models for a given brauer pair . on the other hand",
