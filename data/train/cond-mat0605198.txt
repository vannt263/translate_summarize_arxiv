    "our analysis of filtering in the presence of a harmonic trap has shown that these holes , which are preferably located at the borders of the cloud , result in a considerable amount of entropy @xcite .    here",
    "we propose and investigate several cooling schemes which overcome the limitations of filtering .",

    "we have to represent the state in terms of a matrix - product state ( mps ) @xcite .",
    "this concept can also be used to compute 1d thermal states numerically @xcite .",
    "based on this method one can , for instance , estimate how the temperature of a 1d tube changes when passing from the mi to the sf regime .",
    "assuming that the process is thermodynamically adiabatic one obtains the new temperature with the following procedure .",
    "we tune the parameters of a thermal state in the sf regime until the expectation values for the entropy and particle number match the corresponding values of the initial thermal state in the mi regime .",
    "this can be illustrated with the following example .",
    "starting from a representative state in the no - tunnelling regime with @xmath75 and @xmath37 we have to tune the temperature to @xmath76 at @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) in order to leave @xmath77 and @xmath16 unchanged [ fig .  [ fig_initial_1d]a ] .",
    "hence , in the sf regime one faces a substantial temperature of the order of the width of the lowest bloch band .",

    "the goal in both cases is to create a pure state under the constraint of keeping a large number of particles .",

    "note that these figures of merit can sometimes be misleading and should therefore be applied with care . in the case of ground state cooling",
    "the entropy is only a good figure of merit if the state of the system after the cooling protocol , @xmath83 , is close to thermal equilibrium .",
    "if this is not fulfilled , we use an effective thermal state , @xmath84 , with the same number of particles , @xmath16 , and energy , @xmath85 , to compute the figures of merit .",
    "for instance , the final entropy is given by @xmath86 .",
    "given that our system can somehow thermalize , these will be indeed the properties of our final state . finally , it is important to point out , that other variables , like energy or temperature , are not very well suited as figures of merit , because they depend crucially on external system parameters like the trap strength .",
    "note also that in the case of quantum registers it can be erroneous to assume that a finite value of the final entropy implies the existence of defects .",

    "however , our incoherent scheme has two big advantages .",
    "first , it can be applied continuously .",
    "second , it does not put any constraints on the interaction energies of the two species .",
    "this holds under the assumption that untrapped atoms are expelled so quickly from the trap , that they do not interact significantly with the trapped atoms .",

    "we have seen that algorithmic schemes perform much better than simple filtering . here , we propose two non - algorithmic ground state cooling schemes which combine filtering with other quantum operations available in optical lattices .",
    "the basic idea of this protocol is to first transfer particles from the tails of the cloud to the center of the trap , to form doubly occupied sites , and then to remove these particles with some filtering operation . to be more precise , one has to iterate the following sequence of operations : ( i ) allow for some tunnelling while the trap is adjusted in order to reach a central occupation of @xmath208 .",

    "alternatively , one can think of an implementation of sequential filtering that operates at fixed but non - zero hopping rate .",
    "such a protocol would clearly profit from the fact that adiabatic changes of the lattice potential , which lead to additional heating , are not required .",
    "a key ingredient is the generation of doubly occupied sites in the center .",
    "one has to fix the hopping rate at a value , at which there exists a coupling between doubly occupied sites at the center and singly occupied sites at the borders .",
    "our analysis of the bhm in terms of an effective two - band fermionic model @xcite shows , however , that this occurs typically only deep in the sf regime for @xmath214 .",
    "we have studied the sequential filtering at fixed @xmath6 numerically , computing the cooling efficiency as a function of the hopping rate .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dynamic_3 ] . for high temperatures",
    "the ratio @xmath81 is rather independent of @xmath6 and we achieve some cooling .",
    "for very small temperatures , @xmath215 , it changes dramatically with @xmath6 .",
    "this is a clear signature of the quantum phase transition , which is expected to occur at @xmath216 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "while for @xmath217 the state is well described in terms of independent wells and filtering works very efficiently , for @xmath218 particles are delocalized over the lattice , and filtering causes heating rather than cooling . summing up ,",
    "since we require a significant value of the hopping , @xmath219 , this second variant of sequential filtering can only be used as an initial step , when temperatures are still comparatively high .",
    "particles located at the tails of the density distribution can also be removed with a method similar to evaporative cooling or a frequency knife .",
    "the idea is to make use of inhomogeneous on - site energies and to choose the detuning @xmath220 of a radiation field in such a way that only atoms located at specific lattice sites are resonantly coupled to another internal state . using a magnetic field gradient it has been demonstrated that individual lattice sites can be resolved within an uncertainty of about five sites @xcite . in our case",
    "the spatial dependence of the on - site energies is naturally provided by the harmonic trapping potential . however , in order to make use of this inhomogeneity one has to ensure that the atoms are coupled to an internal state which responds differently to the ac - stark shift induced by the lattice laser beams .",
    "experimentally , this can , for instance , be achieved with a setup similar to the one for the creation of spin - dependent lattices @xcite .",
    "there , one atomic species is trapped exclusively by @xmath221 polarized laser light , whereas the other species is trapped predominantly by @xmath222 polarized light .",
    "hence , an optically untrapped internal state can simply be realized by using only @xmath222 polarized laser light for creating the optical lattice .",
    "let us now estimate the requirements on the the rabi frequency @xmath163 of the transition depending on the trap strength @xmath8 . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider two internal states , and a configuration for which the excited state exhibits zero on - site energy at each lattice site .",
    "we are interested on removing particles which are typically located at a distance @xmath29 from the center of the trap .",
    "hence , for resonant coupling of these atoms we must choose the detuning to be @xmath223 . particles at sites @xmath224 feel an effective detuning @xmath225 , where @xmath226 denotes the particle number ( [ n_bar ] ) . the probability that a particle at site @xmath224 is transferred to the excited state is then given by : @xmath227 in order to locally address the site @xmath29 reasonably well one has to demand : @xmath228 . for typical harmonic trapping frequencies in the mi regime , @xmath229 hz",
    "@xcite , and @xmath230 this translates into @xmath231 khz .",
    "experimentally it should therefore be feasible to resolve individual sites with an uncertainty of a few lattice sites and thus to sharpen the density profile within this uncertainty .",
    "note that this scheme clearly profits from a large number of particles per tube .",
    "another advantage is that it preserves the spherical symmetry of the density distribution in a 3d lattice .",
    "finally let us remark that this method can easily be incorporated in the continuous filtering scheme [ fig .",
    "[ fig_levels ] ] proposed in sect .  [ sect_filtering ] , since there",
    "the atoms are also coupled to untrapped states .",
    "a perfect one - dimensional quantum register is a connected array of commensurately filled lattice sites . for most purposes",
    "the filling factor is @xmath20 .",
    "this state appears naturally as the unique ground state of the bhm in the no - tunnelling limit and in the presence of harmonic confinement .",
    "hence , any efficient ground state cooling protocol will produce a good quantum register .",
    "moreover , we have seen in the previous section , that algorithmic protocols can be used to create an _ ensemble _ of quantum registers rather than a unique one ( see also @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we will propose and analyze two alternative algorithms for the creation of a quantum register ensemble .",
    "as compared to previous proposals @xcite these schemes require only a small number of operations , which makes them more appealing for experimental implementation .",
    "the first protocol produces registers with filling @xmath20 , whereas the second protocol is optimized for filling @xmath141 .",
    "in addition , we propose how to transform atoms at the endpoints of each register into `` pointer '' atoms , which then enables addressing individual lattice sites .",
    "this can be used , for instance , to create registers of equal length .",
    "even more important it offers the opportunity to perform ensemble quantum computation in this system .",
    "we start from a rather cold cloud , @xmath52 , which has been subject to fundamental filtering operations @xmath160 ( [ fn ] ) .",
    "the result is an almost perfect mi in the center of the trap with some residual defects ( or holes ) which are predominantly localized at the borders [ see fig .",
    "[ fig_p1 ] ] .",
    "since we operate solely in the no - tunnelling regime these defects can not redistribute nor evaporate .",
    "our goal is to remove all these defects and we will achieve it by applying nearest - neighbor quantum gates which simulate inelastic collisions between particles and holes .",
    "simply put , whenever a particle sits next to a hole , the particle will be annihilated .",
    "this process is analogous to spin flips in ferromagnets and the formation of domains of equal magnetization .",
    "thus , these algorithmic schemes can also be understood as controlled equilibration and cooling of defects .    for all protocols that will be proposed below",
    ", the resulting state is a mixture of perfect ( up to defects in the central mi phase ) quantum registers , which differ only in their length and lateral position .",
    "the entropy of this state will be of the order @xmath232 , where the parameter @xmath123 ( [ delta ] ) quantifies the translational uncertainty in the initial density distribution .",
    "note , however , even though the final entropy is very small , these protocols are typically not suited for ground state cooling .",
    "the reason is that the final state is far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "numerically we find that the value of the entropy after equilibration is comparable to the value before invoking the protocol .",

    "again we keep only the pointer atom on the right side .",
    "let us now show how to shorten registers of length @xmath287 to length @xmath288 .",
    "we first apply the sequence : @xmath97 , @xmath280 , @xmath289 , @xmath290 , @xmath97 . for the target register of length @xmath288",
    "this merely transfers one atom from the right end of the register to the left end . for larger registers",
    "one obtains a two  atom pointer that can now be used to select and discard all atoms located left of the pointer .",
    "this can be accomplished by iterating the sequence : @xmath285 , @xmath100 , @xmath93 , @xmath97 until all registers with appreciable weight in the density matrix have been shortened to the desired size .",
    "* protocol based on three internal states : * this protocol is based on the operation @xmath291 , which transfers an atom from @xmath87 to @xmath186 , given that a pointer atom is present . this way one can use the pointer as a `` marker '' , which allows one to produce registers of desired length @xmath259 in a very simple manner",
    "one first marks an array of @xmath259 atoms and then discards all atoms which have remained in level @xmath87 .",
    "the algorithm can be summarized as follows : apply the sequence @xmath292 ; iterate @xmath284 times the sequence @xmath293 ; finally apply the operation @xmath294 .",
    "we have proposed various ground state cooling schemes that allow to reduce the temperature in current optical lattice setups considerably . in particular , we have presented algorithmic cooling schemes which combine filtering with concepts inspired by ensemble quantum computation .",
    "we have shown that these algorithmic protocols can be designed both for ground state cooling and the creation of defect - free quantum registers .",
    "we have tested and analyzed our protocols under realistic experimental conditions , with special emphasis on the presence of a harmonic trap .",
    "we found that the residual entropy of all our protocols depends crucially on one parameter which accounts for the translational uncertainty of the initial particle distribution .",
    "a special virtue of our schemes is , that they rely on general concepts which can easily be adapted to different experimental situations .",
    "for instance , little modifications ensure that our protocols can be applied both to bosonic and fermionic systems .",
    "a second advantage of our protocols is , that they are designed for the no  tunnelling regime and hence do not necessarily require equilibration processes induced by particle hopping and elastic collisions .",
    "hence , they allow to approach the ground state of the no - tunnelling regime in very short times .    in this sense , the collection of cooling schemes presented in this article can be considered as a toolbox which is tailored for cooling atoms in optical lattice setups .",
    "the tool ( or combination of tools ) which is best suited for a given purpose , can be chosen according to the characteristic features of a specific experimental setup .",
    "for instance , in the case of large systems at high temperatures , one can think of combining filtering with the frequency knife method which is then followed by the algorithmic ground state cooling protocol . or ground state cooling can be combined with adiabatic transformation of the hamiltonian so as to produce ground states of models different from the simple bose - hubbard considered here .",
    "and one should also keep in mind that a 3d lattice structure offers a large variety of possibilities , which have not been fully explored yet .",
    "the methods introduced here greatly enhance the potential of optical lattice setups for future applications and might pave the way to the experimental realization of quantum simulation and quantum computation in this system .",
    "we also hope that the concepts introduced in this work might trigger further research in the direction of ground state cooling in optical lattices .",
    "this work was supported in part by the eu ist projects quprodis and covaqial , the dfg ( sfb 631 ) and the `` kompetenznetzwerk quanteninformationsverarbeitung der bayerischen staatsregierung '' .",
    "our algorithmic protocols establish classical correlations between different lattice sites , when applied to thermal states in the no - tunnelling regime .",
    "hence , a description in terms of independent wells ( as in ( [ rho_ind ] ) ) is no longer adequate . therefore we refer to a representation in terms of matrix product states ( mps ) @xcite .",
    "to be more precise , for a 1d lattice of length @xmath4 we want to map a classical density matrix of the form @xmath295 onto a pure state in mps form : @xmath296 here , @xmath297 denote matrices of dimension @xmath298 and is the occupation number of site @xmath11 .",
    "the matrices at the endpoints , @xmath299 and @xmath300 , are @xmath301 and @xmath302 vectors , respectively .",
    "the mapping from @xmath303 to @xmath304 can easily be accomplished by setting : @xmath305 .",
    "local operations on @xmath303 , like unitary operations @xmath308 ( [ u_nm ] ) or filter operations ( [ fn ] ) , amount to transformations of the local matrices @xmath309 in the mps picture . for illustration ,",
    "let us consider a completely positive map @xmath310 which acts on a local state @xmath311 at site @xmath11 . in kraus representation",
    "one can write @xmath312 with the kraus operators @xmath313 satisfying the completeness relation @xmath314 . the mps matrices transform according to @xmath315    non - local operations that involve more than one lattice site are more complicated to implement . as an example , let us consider the most complicated case , which occurs in our protocols : a spin - dependent lattice shift @xmath97 which shifts the lattice @xmath88 one site to the left . for this we have to consider two species of atoms . in generalization of ( [ mps ] ) , the mps matrices @xmath316",
    "are now labelled with two physical indices , @xmath317 and @xmath318 , referring to states @xmath319 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "it will turn out to be convenient to rewrite these matrices in tensor form : @xmath320 , with @xmath321 .    to begin with",
    "let us consider only the first two lattice sites .",
    "we start out with tracing over subsystem @xmath88 at the first site : @xmath322 , because we want to omit sites which pass the system boundaries after shifting .",
    "the induced error is negligible , given that sites at the boundaries are not populated .",
    "we then multiply the matrix of the second site and perform the lattice shift : @xmath323 , where we use einstein summation convention .",
    "after relabelling @xmath324 we perform a singular value decomposition : @xmath325 with @xmath326 being a diagonal square matrix and @xmath327 .",
    "the new mps matrix for site @xmath328 can then be defined as : @xmath329 accordingly , we define @xmath330 and iterate this scheme until the end of the lattice . note , that the dimension @xmath331 of the mps matrices can , in principle , increase exponentially with the number of lattice shifts .",
    "if @xmath331 becomes larger than a desired value @xmath332 one has to resort to a truncation method similar to the one proposed for mixed quantum states @xcite .",
    "however , in practice , we find that @xmath331 increases only linearly with the number of lattice shifts , given that each shift is followed by a filter operation .",
    "thus , with our method we can fairly easy simulate protocols exactly , i.e. without truncation , which involve up to @xmath333 lattice shifts on lattices with up to @xmath334 sites ."
