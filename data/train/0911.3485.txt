    "the advent of the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( hereafter , _ fermi _ ) , with its excellent performance , is changing our perception of the sky at high - energy @xmath5 rays .",
    "specifically , the recent detection in the mev - gev energy range of the radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 ( rl - nls1 ) quasar pmn j0948 + 0022 strongly supports the presence of a closely aligned relativistic jet in this peculiar system ( abdo et al . 2009a , c ; foschini et al .",
    "this is quite surprising , since nls1s are generally hosted in spiral galaxies and the presence of a fully developed relativistic jet is contrary to the well - known paradigm that this type of system is associated to ellipticals ( e.g. see marscher 2009 for a recent review ) .    already in the past , several authors inferred from the multiwavelength properties of rl - nls1s some parallelism between this type of source and blazars ( e.g. komossa et al .",
    "2006 , yuan et al .",
    "2008 , foschini et al .",
    "2009b ) , suggesting similarities with different flavors of the blazar types ( quasars or bl lacs ) .",
    "what was missing in these previous studies is the @xmath0ray detection , which is important to confirm the presence of a relativistic jet , to measure its power , and to study the characteristics of this type of sources by modeling their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . indeed ,",
    "blazar - like radio emission from radio - quiet agns has been already reported ( e.g. , brunthaler et al . 2000 , brunthaler et al .",
    "2005 , lister et al . 2009",
    "; see also the review by ho 2008 ) , but no @xmath5 rays have been yet detected from these sources .",
    "this suggests some evident differences between fully developed relativistic jets ( i.e. emitting over the whole electromagnetic spectrum , from radio to @xmath5 rays ) and jet - like ( perhaps aborted ?",
    ", cf ghisellini et al .",
    "2004 ) structures , whose emission at @xmath5 rays in the mev - tev energy range  if any  has not been yet reported .    understanding these differences could give important insights into jet formation .",
    "therefore , we started a larger program aiming at the detection of @xmath0ray emission from other rl - nls1s . since no complete sample of rl - nls1s is available in the literature , we have built a sample by merging all the sources of this type in the catalog of zhou & wang ( 2002 ) and in the lists of komossa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and yuan et al .",
    "we have adopted a threshold in the radio - loudness @xmath6 , in order to avoid doubtful sources at the border ( @xmath7 ) with radio - quietness .",
    "the optical properties are those typical of nls1s , i.e. narrow permitted lines ( fwhm h@xmath8@xmath9  km  s@xmath10 ) , [ oiii]/h@xmath11 and the bump of feii ( see pogge 2000 for a review ) . at radio frequencies , rl - nls1s display strong and variable radio emission , with brightness temperature well above the inverse - compton limit ( see , e.g. , yuan et al . 2008 , table 3 ) .",
    "this selection resulted in a list of 29 sources , most of them selected from the _ sloan digital sky survey _",
    "this low number should not be a surprise . according to komossa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , rl - nls1s are more rare than quasars : 7% of nls1s have @xmath12 and only 2.5% exceed @xmath13 , while generally 10 - 20% of quasars are radio - loud .",
    "although based on a small sample of objects ( 128 ) , these results have been confirmed by studies on larger samples from the sdss ( zhou et al .",
    "2006 , whalen et al .",
    "it is worth noting that this sample is not complete , although the fact that it is based on the sdss ensures a minimum degree of representativeness .    here",
    "we report three new detections at @xmath5 rays of rl - nls1s obtained with _ fermi_/lat .",
    "in addition to the already known pmn j0948 + 0022 ( reported by abdo et al . 2009a , c ;",
    "foschini et al .",
    "2009a ) , this increases the number of @xmath0ray detections of nls1s ( @xmath14 out of 29 sources , @xmath15% of our sample ) , suggesting that they form a new class of @xmath0ray emitting agns .    throughout this work",
    ", we adopted a @xmath16cdm cosmology from the most recent _ wmap _ results , which give the following values for the cosmological parameters : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and with the hubble - lematre constant @xmath20 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 ( komatsu et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the data from the large area telescope ( lat , atwood et al .",
    "2009 ) onboard _ fermi _ were analyzed following the same scheme described in abdo et al .",
    "( 2009a ) , but using a more recent version of the software ( science tools v 9.15.2 ) , instrument response function ( ` irf p6_v3_diffuse ` , rando et al .",
    "2009 ) and background subtraction ( ) . the data analyzed span between mjd 54682 ( 2008 august 4 ) and 55048 ( 2009 august 5 ) .",
    "four lat sources with ts greater than @xmath21 , which is equivalent is roughly @xmath22 . ] to @xmath23 , can be associated with rl - nls1s by using the figure - of - merit ( fom ) method outlined in abdo et al .",
    "( 2009b ) and already used to associate other lat sources with radio counterparts .",
    "one of them is the already well - known pmn j0948 + 0022 ( abdo et al .",
    "the three remaining new sources were associated to the rl - nls1 objects pks  1502 + 036 ( @xmath1 ) , 1h  0323 + 342 ( @xmath2 ) and pks  2004 - 447 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : latsources ] .    0.4 true cm    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the seds built with all the available data are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] . as for pmn j0948 + 0022",
    ", these seds show clear similarities with blazars and therefore we fitted them with the synchrotron and inverse - compton model developed by ghisellini & tavecchio ( 2009 ) .",
    "basically , it adopts an injected relativistic electron distribution with a broken power - law shape , of parameters @xmath24 for energies below the break @xmath25 and @xmath26 above , where @xmath27 is the random lorentz factor of electrons .",
    "this distribution is iteratively modified to take into account electron cooling and the possibility to produce pairs through @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting distribution at the time @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the dissipation radius and @xmath31 is the size of the emitting spherical blob , is used to generate the radiation emitted through the processes of synchrotron , synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) and external - compton ( ec ) .",
    "the seed photons for the latter are the sum of several contributions : photons directly radiated from the accretion disk ( dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ) , from the broad - line region ( blr)@xmath32  km  s@xmath10 . ] , sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ) and from the infrared torus ( baejowski et al .",
    "2000 ; sikora et al .",
    "we refer to ghisellini & tavecchio ( 2009 ) for more details .",
    "the model parameters and the calculated powers are listed in tables  [ tab : inputmodel ] and [ tab : outputmodel ] .",
    "archival radio data are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] for completeness , but are not used in the model fit .",
    "indeed , the one - zone model used in the present work has to explain the bulk of the emission and , therefore , necessarily requires a compact source .",
    "this , in turn , is self - absorbed for synchrotron radiation ( at @xmath33  hz ) .",
    "the radio emission is detectable only when the blob becomes optically thin and this occurs as it moves and expands , further out in the jet ( e.g. blandford & knigl , 1979 ) .",
    "given the scarce , non - simultaneous data and the weakness of the @xmath0ray emission for the three newly discovered sources , it is not possible to tightly constrain the selection of parameters .",
    "as a guide to the selection of the initial values of the model parameters ( table  [ tab : inputmodel ] ) , we were driven by the recent ( march - july 2009 ) multiwavelength study of pmn j0948 + 0022 ( abdo et al . , 2009c ) , our knowledge of blazars , and the mass measurements performed with other methods ( particularly in the case of pks 2004 - 447 , for which the optical / uv data are not sampling the accretion disk emission ) .",
    "when more information , particularly from multiwavelength variability studies , will be available , it will be possible to improve the estimation of the parameter values .",
    "the analysis of the individual sources reveals some things worth noting . in 1h 0323 + 342",
    "the dissipation region needs to be located very close to the central black hole ( @xmath34 times the schwarzchild radius @xmath35 ) and hence a quite high magnetic field ( up to @xmath36 gauss ) is needed .",
    "we note that pks 2004 - 447 seems to be different with respect to the three other rl - nls1s , with optical / uv data sampling the synchrotron emission instead of the accretion disk .",
    "indeed , the classification of this source is still open : while oshlack et al .",
    "( 2001 ) classified it as genuine rl - nls1 , komossa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggested it can be a narrow - line radio galaxy , on the basis that the bump of feii is weak .",
    "gallo et al . ( 2006 ) noted that there is no specific prescription on the value of the strength of the feii bump and confirmed the nls1 classification .",
    "the same authors noted that pks 2004 - 447 is a compact steep - spectrum ( css ) radio source . on the other hand , this source is also in the crates catalog of flat spectrum radio sources ( healey et al .",
    "2007 ) , which includes also the three others nls1s in this work . from the present study ,",
    "the estimated jet power of pks 2004 - 447 is well above the range typical of radio galaxies and , therefore , we favor the hypothesis of a genuine nls1 . however , in this case the classification remains uncertain and should be studied with further observations .",
    "a synoptic analysis of the 4 rl - nls1s in the present work shows that pks 1502 + 036 carries a jet power comparable to pmn j0948 + 0022 , while the remaining two sources are significantly less powerful  even two order of magnitudes for proton powers ( table  [ tab : outputmodel ] ) .",
    "the comparison with the large sample of blazars reported in celotti & ghisellini ( 2008 ) and ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2009b ) , shows that the jet powers of pks 1502 + 036 and pmn j0948 + 0022 are in the region of quasars , while 1h 0323 + 342 and pks 2004 - 447 are in the range typical of bl lac objects .",
    "the @xmath0ray emitting rl - nls1s in our sample have small masses and high accretion rates .",
    "this is in contradiction to the larger masses and and smaller accretion rates expected from low - power blazars ( hfsrqs ) with strong emission lines , as suggested by yuan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . anyway , when comparing the calculated powers with the distribution of powers in blazars ( quasars plus bl lacs ; see ghisellini et al .",
    "2009b ) , rl - nls1s are in the average range .",
    "the main differences with respect to blazars are in the masses and accretion rates .",
    "the masses of the three newly discovered rl - nls1s are around @xmath37 , in agreement within one order of magnitude with the values obtained with other methods . in the case of 1h 0323 + 342 ,",
    "zhou et al . ( 2007 ) found values of @xmath38 with @xmath39 luminosity and @xmath40 with the luminosity of the continuum at 5100 . in the case of pks 1502 + 036 ,",
    "yuan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) estimate the mass to be @xmath41 , by means of the virial method . these value are about 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than the typical blazar masses ( @xmath42 , see ghisellini et al .",
    "the accretion rates can reach extreme values , up to 80 or even 90% the eddington values in the cases of pks 1502 + 036 and 1h 0323 + 342 , respectively .",
    "these values are the most extreme ever found in any @xmath0ray emitting agns , but usual for nls1s .",
    "what is at odds with this scenario is the type of host galaxy , which is elliptical in all blazars , while is likely to be spiral in rl - nls1s ( see , e.g. zhou et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the case of 1h 0323 + 342 ,",
    "analysis of optical observations suggests two possibilities : zhou et al .",
    "( 2007 ) show the spiral arms of the host galaxy by means of observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ , while antn et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , on the basis of ground - based observations with nordic optical telescope ( not ) , suggest that these structures are the residual of a merging that occurred within the past @xmath43 years .",
    "this means that relativistic jets can form and develop independently of their host galaxies , with quasars , bl lacs and , now , rl - nls1s jointly characterized by the presence of a relativistic jet and with the differences in their observed seds mainly determined by their masses and accretion rates .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include the national aeronautics and space administration and the department of energy in the united states , the commissariat  lenergie atomique and the centre national de la recherche scientifique / institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules in france , the agenzia spaziale italiana and the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare in italy , the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) and japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board in sweden .",
    "additional support for science analysis during the operations phase is gratefully acknowledged from the istituto nazionale di astrofisica in italy and the centre national dtudes spatiales in france .",
