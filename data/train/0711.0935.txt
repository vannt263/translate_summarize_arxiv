    "in the two - higgs doublet models  @xcite and in most susy scenarios  @xcite the extended scalar sector contains five physical fields : a couple of charged higgs bosons ( @xmath3 ) , a cp - odd scalar @xmath1 , and two cp - even scalars @xmath4 ( the lightest , which is to be identified with the sm higgs ) and @xmath0 .",
    "it is expected that their discovery and subsequenet study of their fundamental physical properties should be of central importance in the next decades .",
    "in addition to the lhc , where their primary discovery might take place , further detailed studies of their characteristics have been proposed in recent years , most notably in the context of muon-@xcite and photon colliders  @xcite .",
    "a very characteristic feature of the the @xmath0-@xmath1 system is that the masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 of these two particles are nearly degenerate .",
    "specifically , their tree - level mass eigenvalues are related by  @xcite @xmath7\\,.\\ ] ] in the decoupling limit , @xmath8 , we have that @xmath9 which , for @xmath10 ( and thus @xmath11 ) , implies that @xmath12 . in general , the inclussion of radiative corrections is known to modify significantly the above tree - level relation , mainly due to the large yukawa coupling of the top - quark , but does _ not _ lift the mass degeneracy , especially in the parameter space region where @xmath13 and @xmath10   @xcite .",
    "therefore , the high - resolution scanning of the lineshape of the @xmath0-@xmath1 system is expected to reveal two relatively closely spaced , or even superimposed , resonances  @xcite .    evidently ,",
    "if the cp symmetry is exact , the @xmath0 can not mix with the @xmath1 , at any given order .",
    "however , in the presence of a cp - violating interactions @xcite the @xmath0 can mix with the @xmath1 already at one - loop level , giving rise to a non - vanishing mixing self - energy @xmath14 . such mixing , in turn , can be measured through the study of appropriate cp - odd observables , for example left - right asymmetries . as has been explained in @xcite the cp - violating amplitude",
    "is particularly enhanced near resonace , if the two mixing particles are nearly degenerate , a condition which is naturally fullfilled in the @xmath0-@xmath1 system .",
    "furthermore , the mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath1 has an additional profound effect for the two masses : the near degeneracy of the two particles is lifted , and the pole masses move further apart @xcite ; as a result , the originally overlapping resonances of the cp - invariant theory tend to be separated .    in @xcite",
    "we have explored the possibility of detecting the presence of cp - mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath1 through the detailed study of the cross - section of the @xmath2-channel process @xmath15 as function of the center - of - mass energy . although the lineshape is a cp - even quantity , there are certain characteristics that signal the presence of a cp - violating mixing . due to the facts reviewed above , when studying the lineshape of the @xmath0-@xmath1 system , one may envisage two , physically very different , scenarios . in the first one ,",
    "the cp symmetry is exact , with the position of resonances determined by eq.([deg ] ) plus its radiative corrections ; the relative position between the two resonance will then specify @xmath16 . in the second scenario ,",
    "cp is violated , resulting in mixing at one - loop level between cp - even and cp - odd states wich translates into a non - vanishing off - shell transition amplitude @xmath14 . then , for the same mass splitting @xmath17 as in the previous case , one may not reach the same conclusion for the value of @xmath16 , because one could have started out with the two masses almost degenerate , corresponding to a different value for @xmath16 ( lower or higher depending on the value of the @xmath18 parameter ) , and the observed separation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 may be due to the lifting of the degeneracy produced by the presence of the aforementioned @xmath14 .",
    "we have studied the lineshape of the process @xmath15 , assuming the presence of cp - violating one - loop mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , induced by the yukawa couplings to the top and bottom squarks  @xcite .",
    "the kinematic regime considerd is @xmath13 and @xmath21 ; the rotation angle of the scalar top and bottom quarks are equal to @xmath22 , and we assume universal squarks soft masses ( @xmath23 tev ) and trilinear couplings ( @xmath24 with @xmath25 ) .",
    "finally @xmath26 has been fixed at the value of @xmath27 tev .",
    "the result of our analysis may be summarized as follows  @xcite : in the cases when the cp - breaking phases are sizeable ( @xmath28 , not shown ) , one can always clearly distinguish between the cp - invariant and cp - beaking scenarios , either because the mass splitting in the latter case is just too big for being due to cp - invariant radiative corrections only , or because of the different energy dependence of the cross section . for smaller values of the cp - breaking phases ( say @xmath29 ,",
    "see fig.1 ) , one can still distinguish between the cp - invariant and cp - breaking case only when @xmath16 is small ; when @xmath30 one can not tell the two cases apart simply by studying the lineshape .",
    "thus , in general we conclude that either the mass - splitting of the h and a higgs boson , in a cp - mixing scenario , can not be accounted for in absence of cp - mixing , and/or the detailed energy dependence of the line - shape allows to discriminate between both scenarios .",
    "we therefore believe that the experimental determination of the @xmath0-@xmath1 line - shape , in conjunction with cp - odd asymmetries and other suitable observables , may provide valuable information for settling the issue regarding cp - mixing effects in two - higgs doublet models",
    ". it would be interesting to extend this analysis to the more complicated case of the lhc , taking into account the variable gluon virtualities , in the spirit of  @xcite .",
