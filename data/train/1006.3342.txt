    "the classical regression problem is concerned with predicting a noisy continuous response using a @xmath0-dimensional predictor vector with support on some @xmath0-dimensional subspace .",
    "this functional relationship is often taken to be smooth and methods for estimating it range from parametric models , which specify the form of the relationship between predictors and response , through to nonparametric models , which have fewer prior assumptions about the shape of the fit . an important consideration for fitting such a regression model",
    "is whether all @xmath0 predictors are in fact necessary .",
    "if a particular predictor has no relationship to the response , the model be made both simpler and more accurate by removing it . in recent years",
    "there has been strong interest in techniques that automatically generate such `` sparse '' models .",
    "most attention has been given to parametric forms , and in particular the linear model , where the response is assumed to vary linearly with the predictors .",
    "there has also been some investigation into variable selection for nonlinear models , notably through the use of smoothing splines and local regression .",
    "one common feature of the existing sparse methods is that the variable selection is `` global '' in nature , attempting to universally include or exclude a predictor .",
    "such an approach does not naturally reconcile well with some nonparametric techniques , such as local polynomial regression , which focus on a `` local '' subset of the data to estimate the response . in this local context",
    "it would be more helpful to understand local variable influence , since predictors that are irrelevant in some regions may in fact be important elsewhere in the subspace . just as in the global setting ,",
    "such information would allow us to improve the accuracy and parsimony of a model , but at a local level .",
    "however this approach to variable selection can be problematic .",
    "most notably , variable significance affects the definition of `` local '' . to illustrate concretely ,",
    "suppose that two data points were close in every dimension except one .",
    "in typical local regression these points would not be considered close , and so the response at one point would not impact the other . if , however , we establish that the one predictor they differ by is not influential over a range that includes both these points , then they should actually be treated as neighbouring , and be treated as such in the model .",
    "any methodology seeking to incorporate local variable influence needs to accommodate such potential situations .    understanding local variable significance can also give additional insight into a dataset .",
    "if a variable is not important in certain regions of the support , knowledge of this allows us to discount it in certain circumstances , simplifying our understanding of the problem .",
    "for example , if none of the variables are relevant in a region , we may treat the response as locally constant and so know that we can ignore predictor effects when an observation lies in this region .",
    "a final consideration is theoretical performance .",
    "in particular we shall present on approach that is `` oracle '' ; that is , its performance is comparable to that of a particularly well - informed statistician , who has been provided in advance with the correct variables .",
    "it is interesting to note that variable interactions often cause sparse parametric approaches to fail to be oracle , but in the local nonparametric setting this is not an issue , because such interactions vanish as the neighbourhood of consideration shrinks .    in this paper",
    "we propose a flexible and adaptive approach to local variable selection using local polynomial regression .",
    "the key technique is careful adjustment of the local regression bandwidths to allow for variable redundancy .",
    "the method has been named labavs , standing for `` locally adaptive bandwidth and variable selection '' .",
    "section  2 will introduce the labavs algorithm , including a motivating example and possible variations . section  3 will deal with theoretical properties and in particular establishes a result showing that the performance of labavs is better than oracle when the dimension remains fixed .",
    "section  4 presents numerical results for both real and simulated data , showing that the algorithm can improve prediction accuracy and is also a useful tool in arriving at an intuitive understanding of the data .",
    "technical details have been relegated to an appendix which may be found in the long version of this paper ( miller and hall , 2010 ) .",
    "labavs is perhaps best viewed as an improvement to local polynomial regression , and will retain some of the advantages and disadvantages associated with this approach . in particular , it still suffers the `` curse of dimensionality , '' in that it struggles to detect local patterns when the dimension of genuine variables increases beyond a few .",
    "it is not the first attempt at incorporating variable selection into local polynomial regression ; the papers by lafferty and wasserman ( 2008 ) and bertin and lecu ( 2008 ) also do this .",
    "we compare our approach to these in some detail in section  [ se : compare ] .",
    "labavs can also be compared to other nonparametric techniques in use for low to moderate dimensions .",
    "these include generalised additive models , mars and tree based methods ( see hastie 2001 ) .    the earliest work on local polynomial regression dates back to that of nadaraya ( 1964 ) and watson ( 1964 ) .",
    "general references on the subject include wand and jones ( 1995 ) , simonoff ( 1996 ) and loader ( 1999 ) .",
    "an adaptive approach to bandwidth selection may be found in fan and gijbels ( 1995 ) , although this was not in the context of variable selection .",
    "tibshirani ( 1996 ) studies the lasso , one of the most popular sparse solutions for the linear model ; more recent related work on the linear model includes that of candes and tao ( 2007 ) and bickel ( 2009 ) .",
    "zou ( 2006 ) created the adaptive version of the lasso and proved oracle performance for it .",
    "lin and zhang ( 2006 ) and yuan and lin ( 2006 ) have investigated sparse solutions to smoothing spline models .",
    "the labavs algorithm also bears some similarity to the approach adopted by hall ( 2004 ) .",
    "there the aim was to estimate the conditional density of a response using the predictors .",
    "cross - validation was employed and the bandwidths in irrelevant dimensions diverged , thereby greatly downweighting those components . in the present paper",
    "the focus is more explicitly on variable selection , as well as attempting to capture local variable dependencies .",
    "suppose that we have a continuous response @xmath1 and a @xmath0-dimensional random predictor vector @xmath2 which has support on some subspace @xmath3 .",
    "further , assume that the observation pairs @xmath4 are independent and identically distributed for @xmath5 , and that @xmath6 has density function @xmath7 .",
    "the response is related to the predictors through a function @xmath8 , y_i = g(x_i ) + _ i , [ eq : simple ] with the error @xmath9 having zero mean and fixed variance . smoothness conditions for @xmath7 and @xmath8 will be discussed in the theory section .",
    "local polynomial regression makes use of a kernel and bandwidth to assign increased weight to neighbouring observations compared to those further away , which will often have zero weight .",
    "we take @xmath10 to be the @xmath0-dimensional rectangular kernel formed from a one dimensional kernel @xmath11 such as the tricubic kernel , @xmath12 [ kernel ] assume @xmath11 is symmetric with support on @xmath13 $ ] . for @xmath14 bandwidth matrix @xmath15",

    ". asymmetric bandwidths can be defined as having both a lower and an upper ( diagonal ) bandwidth matrix , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , for a given estimation point @xmath20 , rather than a single bandwidth @xmath15 for all @xmath20 .",
    "the kernel weight of an observation @xmath6 at estimation point @xmath20 with asymmetrical bandwidth matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 , is @xmath25 this amounts to having ( possibly ) different window sizes above and below @xmath20 in each direction .",
    "although such unbalanced bandwidths would often lead to undesirable bias properties in local regression , here they will be used principally to extend bandwidths in dimensions considered redundant , so this issue is not a concern .",
    "we also allow the possibility of infinite bandwidths @xmath26 . in calculating the kernel in ( [ eq : ker ] ) when @xmath27 is infinite , proceed as if the @xmath28th dimension did not exist ( or equivalently , as if the @xmath28th factor in rectangular kernel product is always equal to 1 ) .",
    "if all bandwidths are infinite , consider the kernel weight to be 1 everywhere .",
    "although the kernel and bandwidth conditions above have been defined fairly narrowly to promote simplicity in exposition , many of these assumptions are easily generalised .",
    "local polynomial regression estimates of the response at point @xmath20 , @xmath29 , are found by fitting a polynomial @xmath30 to the observed data , using the kernel and bandwidth to weight observations .",
    "this is usually done by minimising the weighted sum of squares , _",

    "the algorithm achieves a partial dimension reduction .",
    "the increased bandwidths reduce the variance of the estimate and step  4 swaps some of this reduction for a decrease in the bias to further improve the overall estimator .    [ se : eg ]    as a concrete example of the approach , define the following one - dimensional `` huberised '' linear function : g(x ) = x^2(0 < x 0.4 ) + ( 0.8x-0.16)(x>0.4 ) , and let @xmath47_+^2+[x^{(2)}]_+^2)^{1/2}\\}$ ] for 2-dimensional random variable @xmath48 .",

    "thus in each of these quadrants a different subset of the predictors is significant .",
    "a local approach to variable significance can capture these different dependencies , while a global variable redundancy test would not eliminate any variables .",

    "the dots are four sample estimation points , the surrounding unit squares indicate the initial bandwidths and the dashed lines indicate how the bandwidths are modified . in the bottom",
    "left quadrant both variables are considered redundant , and so the bandwidth expands to cover the entire quadrant . this is optimal behaviour , since the true function is constant over this region , implying that the best estimator will be produced by including the whole area . in the bottom right quadrant",
    "the first dimension is significant while the second is not .",
    "thus the bandwidth for the second dimension is `` stretched '' , while the first is shrunken somewhat .",
    "again , this is desirable for improving the estimator .",
    "the stretching in the second dimension improves the estimator by reducing the variance as more points are considered .",
    "then the shrunken first dimension swaps some of this reduction in variance for decreased bias .",
    "finally , in the top right quadrant , there is no change in the bandwidth since both variables are considered to be significant .",

    "the approach also scales naturally to higher order polynomials , provided all polynomial terms are locally standardised ; a variable is considered redundant if all terms that include it have corresponding parameters set to zero by the lasso .",

    "[ newfac2 ] the theoretical properties in section  [ theory ] deal with the global bandwidth scenario .",

    "the choice of distance between grid points in step  2 is somewhat arbitrary , but should be taken as less than @xmath86 so that all data points are considered in calculations . in the asymptotic theory",
    "we let this length decrease faster that the rate of the bandwidth , and in numerical experimentation the choice impacts only slightly on the results .",
    "2 .   step 5 of the algorithm forces the estimate at point @xmath20 to exclude variables indexed in @xmath41 .",
    "an alternative is to still use all variables in the final fit .",
    "this may be advantageous in situations with significant noise , where variable admission and omission is more likely to have errors . despite including these extra variables",
    ", the adjusted bandwidths still ensure that estimation accuracy is increased .",
    "3 .   finding the maximal rectangle for each representative point , as suggested in step  3 of the algorithm , can be a fairly intensive computational task . in our numerical work we simplified this by expanding the rectangle equally until the boundary met a `` bad '' grid point ( i.e.  a point @xmath87 such that @xmath88 ) .",
    "the corresponding direction was then held constant while the others continue to increase uniformly .",
    "we continued until each dimension stopped expanding or grew to be infinite .",
    "this approach does not invalidate the asymptotic results in section  [ theory ] , but there may be some deterioration in numerical performance associated with this simplification .",
    "4 .   if a variable is redundant everywhere , results in section  [ theory ] demonstrate that the algorithm is consistent ; the probability that the variable is classified as redundant everywhere tends to 1 as @xmath89 grows .",
    "however , the exact probability is not easy to calculate and for fixed @xmath89 we may want greater control over the ability to exclude a variable completely . in such circumstances",
    "a global variable selection approach may be appropriate .",
    "as noted at the start of section  2.2 , the initial bandwidth in step  1 does not necessarily have to be fixed over the domain .",
    "for instance , a nearest neighbour bandwidth , where @xmath86 at @xmath20 is roughly proportional to @xmath90 , could be used . employing this approach offers many practical advantages and",
    "the theoretical basis is similar to that for the constant bandwidth .",
    "the numerical work makes use of nearest neighbour bandwidths throughout .",
    "in addition , we could use an initial bandwidth that was allowed to vary for each variable , @xmath91 .",
    "so long as , asymptotically , each @xmath27 was equal to @xmath92 for some controlling bandwidth @xmath86 and constant @xmath93 , the theory would hold , although details are not pursued here .      as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "two recent papers take a similar approach to this problem .",
    "firstly lafferty and wasserman ( 2008 ) introduce the rodeo procedure .",
    "this attempts to assign adaptive bandwidths based on the derivative with respect to the bandwidth for each dimension , @xmath94 .",
    "this has the attractive feature of bypassing the actual local shape and instead focussing on whether an estimate is improved by shrinking the bandwidths .",
    "it is also a greedy approach , starting with large bandwidths in each direction and shrinking only those that cause a change in the estimator at a point .",
    "the second paper is by bertin and lecu ( 2008 ) , who implement a two step procedure to reduce the dimensionality of a local estimate .",
    "the first step fits a local linear estimate with an @xmath95 or lasso type penalty , which identifies the relevant variables .",
    "this is followed by a second local linear fit using this reduced dimensionality .",
    "the lasso penalty they use is precisely the same as the third approach suggested in section  [ se : approaches ] .",
    "we comment on the similarities and differences of these two approaches compared to the current presentation , which are summarised in table  [ tabcomp ] .",
    "firstly the theoretical framework of the two other papers focus exclusively on the performance at a single point , while the labavs approach ensures uniformly oracle performance on the whole domain .",
    "the framework for the other two also assumes that variables are either active on the whole domain or redundant everywhere , while we have already discussed the usefulness of an approach that can adapt to variables that are redundant on various parts of the data .",
    "we believe this is particularly important , since local tests of variable significance will give the same results everywhere .",
    "related to this , our method does not require an assumption of nonzero gradients ( whether with respect to the bandwidth or variables ) to obtain adequate theoretical performance , in contrast to the other methods . on the other hand",
    ", ensuring both uniform performance while allowing @xmath0 to be increasing is a quite challenging , so our presentation assumes @xmath0 is fixed , while the others do not .",
    "it is also worth noting that the greedy approach of lafferty and wasserman potentially gives it an advantage in higher dimensional situations .",
    "while all approaches work in a similar framework , the above discussion demonstrates that there are significant differences .",
    "our methodology may be viewed as a generalisation of the work of bertin and lecu , save for imposing fixed dimensionality .",
    "it can also be viewed as a competitor to the rodeo , and some numerical examples comparing the two are provided .

    "if however we need to make predictions at a reasonable number of points , then labavs is likely to be more efficient , since the grid calculations need only be done once , while rodeo requires a new set of bandwidth calculations for each point .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a useful means of establishing the power of a model that includes variable selection is to compare it with an oracle model , where the redundant variables are removed before the modelling is undertaken . in the linear ( and the parametric ) context ,",
    "we interpret the oracle property as satisfying two conditions as @xmath96 :    1 .",
    "the probability that the correct variables are selected converges to 1 , and 2 .",
    "the nonzero parameters are estimated at the same asymptotic rate as they would be if the correct variables were known in advance .",
    "we wish to extend this notion of an oracle property to the nonparametric setting , where some predictors may be redundant .",
    "here there are no parameters to estimate , so attention should instead be given to the error associated with estimating @xmath8 .",
    "below we define weak and strong forms of these oracle properties :    the _ weak _ oracle property in nonparametric regression is :    1 .   the probability that the correct variables are selected converges to 1 , and 2 .   at each point",

    "@xmath20 the error of the estimator @xmath29 has the same first - order asymptotic properties as it would if the correct variables were known in advance .",
    "observe that the weak oracle property achieves the correct rate of estimation while the strong version achieves both the correct rate and the same asymptotic distribution .",
    "the first definition is most analogous to its parametric counterpart , while the second is more ambitious in scope .",
    "here we establish the strong version of the nonparametric oracle property for the labavs algorithm , with technical details found in the appendix ( miller and hall , 2010 ) .",
    "we shall restrict attention to the case of fixed dimension . to apply to a situation of increasing dimension , we could add an asymptotically consistent screening method to reduce it back to fixed @xmath0 .",
    "the treatment here focuses on local linear polynomials , partly for convenience but also recognising that the linear factors dominate higher order terms in the asymptotic local fit .",
