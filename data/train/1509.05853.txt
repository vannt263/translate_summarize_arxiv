    "a number of zero mean curvature surfaces of mixed type in lorentz - minkowski three - space @xmath7 were found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one of the main tools for the construction of such surfaces is based on the fact that fold singularities of space - like maximal surfaces have real analytic extensions to time - like minimal surfaces ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "some of the analytic extensions of such examples have neither singularities nor self - intersections .",
    "a typical such example is a space - like helicoid , which analytically extends to a time - like surface , and the entire surface coincides with the original helicoid as a minimal surface in @xmath2 .",
    "also , the scherk type surface @xmath8 gives an entire graph which changes type from a space - like maximal surface to a time - like zero mean curvature surface , as pointed out by kobayashi @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown in @xcite that the space - like maximal analogues in @xmath5 of the schwarz d surfaces in @xmath2 have analytic extensions as triply periodic embedded zero mean curvature surfaces .     and the analytic extension of @xmath9 ( in the figure on the right - hand side , the time - like parts are indicated by black shading).,title=\"fig:\",height=151 ] 1.7 cm   and the analytic extension of @xmath9 ( in the figure on the right - hand side ,",
    "the time - like parts are indicated by black shading).,title=\"fig:\",height=173 ]    these examples caused the authors to be interested in space - like maximal analogues @xmath4 ( @xmath10 ) of jorge - meeks minimal surfaces with @xmath0 catenoidal ends .",
    "these surfaces have fold singularities , and have analytic extensions to time - like surfaces .",
    "we show in this paper that the analytic extension of @xmath4 is a proper embedding .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the lorentz - minkowski @xmath11-space of signature @xmath12 and denote the riemann sphere by @xmath13 .",
    "[ def : w ] a pair @xmath14 consisting of a meromorphic function and a meromorphic @xmath15-form defined on the riemann sphere is called a _ weierstrass data on @xmath16 _ if the metric @xmath17 has no zeros on @xmath16 . a point where @xmath18 diverges",
    "is called an _ end _ of @xmath19 .",
    "we now fix a weierstrass data @xmath14 on @xmath16 and let @xmath20 be the set of ends of @xmath18",
    ". then the real part of the map @xmath21 is a map @xmath22 into @xmath5 which is defined on the universal cover of @xmath23 .",

    "if @xmath24 is single - valued on @xmath23 , then we say that @xmath24 satisfies the _ period condition_. the first fundamental form of @xmath24 is given by @xmath26 in particular , the singular set of @xmath24 consists of the points where @xmath27 .",
    "in this situation , we set @xmath28 . as pointed out in @xcite , the real part @xmath29 of the holomorphic map @xmath30",

    "* definition 2.7 ) ) .",
    "the minimal immersion @xmath31 is called the _ companion _ of @xmath24 .",
    "we are interested in the maximal surface @xmath4 associated to @xmath35 as pointed out in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 5.7 ) , the companion of @xmath4 is congruent to the well - known complete minimal surface with catenoidal ends , called a _ jorge - meeks surface _ ( cf .",

    "it can be checked that @xmath4 is single - valued on @xmath38 , and the original jorge - meeks surface is as well .",
    "so @xmath4 is a maxface , and we call @xmath39 the _ jorge - meeks type maximal surfaces_. the singular set of @xmath4 is the set @xmath40 , which consists of generic fold singularities in the sense of @xcite , that is , the image of the singular set consists of a union of non - degenerate null curves in @xmath5 .",
