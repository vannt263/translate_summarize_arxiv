    "with each domain and material parameter , an infinite number of tensors , called the generalized polarization tensors ( gpts ) , is associated .",
    "the concept of gpts was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the gpts contain significant information on the shape of the domain @xcite .",
    "it occurs in several interesting contexts , in particular , in low - frequency scattering @xcite , asymptotic models of dilute composites ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , in invisibility cloaking in the quasi - static regime @xcite and in potential theory related to certain questions arising in hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "another important use of this concept is for imaging diametrically small conductivity inclusions from boundary or multistatic response measurements .",
    "multistatic response measurements are obtained using arrays of point source transmitters and receivers .",
    "this measurement configuration gives the so - called multistatic response matrix ( msr ) , which measures the change in potential field due to a conductivity inclusion .",
    "in fact , the gpts are the basic building blocks for the asymptotic expansions of the perturbations of the msr matrix due to the presence of small conductivity inclusions inside a conductor @xcite .",
    "they can be reconstructed from the multi - static response ( msr ) matrix by solving a linear system .",
    "the system has the remarkable property that low order generalized polarization tensors are not affected by the error caused by the instability of higher orders in the presence of measurement noise . based on the asymptotic expansion , efficient and direct ( non - iterative ) algorithms to determine the location and some geometric features of the inclusions were proposed .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein for recent developments of this theory .",
    "an efficient numerical code for computing the gpts is described in @xcite .    in @xcite , we have analyzed the stability and the resolving order of gpt in a circular full angle of view setting with coincident sources and receivers , and developed efficient algorithms for target identification from a dictionary by matching the contracted gpts ( cgpts ) .",
    "the cgpts are particular linear combinations of the gpts ( called harmonic combinations ) and were first introduced in @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "explicit relations between the cgpt of scaled , rotated and translated objects have been established in @xcite , which suggest strongly that the gpts can also be used for tracking the location and the orientation of a mobile object .",
    "one should have in mind that , in real applications , one would like to localize the target and reconstruct its orientation directly from the msr data without reconstructing the gpts .",
    "in this paper we apply an extended kalman filter to track both the location and the orientation of a mobile target directly from msr measurements .",
    "the extended kalman filter ( ekf ) is a generalization of the kalman filter ( kf ) to nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "it is robust with respect to noise and computationally inexpensive , therefore is well suited for real - time applications such as tracking @xcite .",
    "target tracking is an important task in sonar and radar imaging , security technologies , autonomous vehicle , robotics , and bio - robotics , see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "an example in bio - robotics is the weakly electric fish which has the faculty to probe an exterior target with its electric dipole and multiple sensors distributed on the skin @xcite .",
    "the fish usually swims around the target to acquire information .",
    "the use of kalman - type filtering for target tracking is quite standard , see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time where tracking of the orientation of a target is provided .",
    "moreover , we analyze the ill - posed character of both the location and orientation tracking in the case of limited - view data . in practice",
    ", it is quite realistic to have the sources / receivers cover only a limited angle of view . in this case , the reconstruction of the gpts becomes more ill - posed than in the full - view case .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to provide a fast algorithm for tracking both the location and the orientation of a mobile target , and precisely analyze the stability of the inverse problem in the limited - view setting .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : cond_prob_cgpt2 ] we recall the conductivity problem and the linear system relating the cgpts with the msr data , and provide a stability result in the full angle of view setting . in section [ sec : tracking_of_mobile_target ] we present a gpt - based location and orientation tracking algorithm using an extended kalman filter and show the numerical results in the full - view setting . in section [ sec : limited_angle_view ]",
    "we analyze the stability of the cgpt - reconstruction in the limited - view setting and also test the performance of the tracking algorithm .",
    "the paper ends with a few concluding remarks .",

    "ekf is no longer optimal , but it remains robust with respect to noise and computationally inexpensive , therefore is well suited for real - time applications such as tracking .",
    "we establish here the _ system state _ and the _ observation _ equations which are fundamental to ekf , and refer readers to appendix [ sec : extend - kalm - filt ] for its algorithmic details .",
