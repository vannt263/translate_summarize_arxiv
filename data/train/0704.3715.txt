    "in any bottom - up approach to the still unsolved protein folding problem @xcite , the characterization of the conformational behaviour of short peptides @xcite constitutes an unavoidable first step . if high accuracy of the treatment is sought , numerically expensive methods must be used to calculate the physical properties of these protein subunits .",
    "this is why , the most frequently studied peptides are the shortest ones : the _ dipeptides _",
    "@xcite , in which a single amino acid residue is capped at both the n- and c - termini with neutral peptide groups . among them , the most popular choice has been the _ alanine _ dipeptide @xcite , which , being the simplest chiral residue , shares many similarities with most of the rest of dipeptides for the minimum computational price .",
    "although classical force fields @xcite are the only feasible choice for simulating large molecules at present , they have been reported to yield inaccurate _ potential energy surfaces _ ( pess ) for dipeptides @xcite and short peptides @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that they are widely recognized as being unable to capture the fine details needed to correctly describe the intricacies of the whole protein folding process @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "albeit prohibitively demanding in terms of computational resources , ab initio quantum mechanical calculations @xcite are not only regarded as the correct physical description that in the long run will be the preferred choice to directly tackle proteins ( given the exponential growth of computer power ) , but they are also used in small peptides as the reference against which less accurate methods must be compared @xcite in order to parameterize improved generations of additive , classical force fields for polypeptides .",
    "however , despite the sound theoretical basis , in practical quantum chemistry calculations a plethora of approximations must be typically made if one wants to obtain the final results in a reasonable human time .",
    "the exact ` recipe ' that includes all the assumptions and steps needed to calculate the relevant observables for any molecular system has been termed _ model chemistry _ ( mc ) by john pople . in his own words ,",
    "a mc is an `` approximate but well - defined general and continuous mathematical procedure of simulation '' @xcite .",
    "the two starting approximations to the exact schrdinger equation that a mc must contain are , first , the truncation of the @xmath1-electron space ( in wavefunction - based methods ) or the choice of the functional ( in dft ) and , second , the truncation of the one - electron space , via the lcao scheme ( in both cases ) .",
    "the extent up to which the first truncation is carried ( or the functional chosen in the case of dft ) is commonly called the _ method _ and it is denoted by acronyms such as rhf , mp2 , b3lyp , ccsd(t ) , fci , etc . , whereas the second truncation is embodied in the definition of a finite set of atom - centered gaussian functions termed _ basis set _",
    "@xcite , which is also designated by conventional short names , such as 6 - 31+g(d ) , tzp or cc - pvtz(f ) .",
    "if we denote the method by a capital @xmath2 and the basis set by a @xmath3 , the specification of both is conventionally denoted by @xmath4 and called a _ level of the theory_. typical examples of this are rhf/3 - 21 g or mp2/cc - pvdz @xcite .",
    "such levels of the theory are , by themselves , valid mcs , however , it is very common @xcite to use different levels to perform , first , a ( possibly constrained ) geometry optimization and , then , a single - point energy calculation on top of the resulting structures .",
    "if we denote by @xmath5 a given level of the theory , this ` mixed ' calculation is indicated by @xmath6 , where the level  @xmath7 at which the single - point energy calculation is performed is written first @xcite . herein ,",
    "if @xmath8 , we shall call @xmath6 an _ heterolevel _ mc ; whereas , if @xmath9 it will be termed a _ homolevel _ one , and it will be typically abbreviated omitting the ` double slash ' notation .    apart from the approximations described above , which are the most commonly used and the only ones that are considered in this work , the mc concept may include a lot of additional features : protocols for extrapolating to the infinite - basis set limit @xcite , additivity assumptions @xcite , extrapolations of the mller - plesset series to infinite order @xcite , removal of the so - called _ basis set superposition error _ ( bsse ) @xcite , etc .",
    "the reason behind most of these techniques is the urging need to reduce the computational cost of the calculations .",
    "for example , in the case of the heterolevel approximation , this economy principle forces the level @xmath7 at which the single - point energy calculation is performed to be more accurate and more numerically demanding than @xmath10 ; the reason being simply that , while we must compute the energy only once at @xmath7 , we need to calculate several times the energy and its gradient with respect to the unconstrained internal nuclear coordinates at level @xmath10 ( the actual number of times depending on the starting structure , the algorithms used and the size of the system ) .",
    "therefore , it would be pointless to use an heterolevel mc @xmath6 in which @xmath10 is more expensive than @xmath7 , since , at the end of the geometry optimization , the energy at level @xmath7 is available .    now",
    ", although general applicability is a requirement that all mcs must satisfy , general accuracy is not mandatory .",
    "actually , the fact is that the different procedures that conform a given mc are typically parameterized and tested in very particular systems , which are often small molecules .",
    "therefore , the validity of the approximations outside that native range of problems must be always questioned and checked , but , while the computational cost of a given mc is easy to evaluate , its expected accuracy on a particular problem could be difficult to predict a priori , specially if we are dealing with large molecules in which interactions in very different energy scales are playing a role .",
    "the description of the conformational behaviour of peptides ( or , more generally , flexible organic species ) , via their pess in terms of the soft internal coordinates , is one of such problems and the one that is treated in this work .",
    "our aim here is to provide an exhaustive study of the _ restricted hartree fock _ ( rhf ) and _ mller - plesset 2 _ ( mp2 ) methods , using the split - valence families of basis sets devised by pople and collaborators @xcite . to this end",
    ", we compare the pes of the model dipeptide hco - l - ala - nh@xmath0 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : num_ala_rama ] ) calculated with a large number of homo- and heterolevel mcs , and assess their efficiency by comparison with a reference pes .",
    "special interest is devoted to the evaluation of the influence of polarization and diffuse functions in the basis sets , distinguishing between those placed at 1st - row atoms and those placed at hydrogens , as well as the effect of different contraction and valence - splitting schemes .",
    "the second objective of this study , and probably the main one , is the investigation of the _ heterolevel assumption _ , which is defined here to be that which states that _ heterolevel mcs are more efficient than homolevel ones_. the heterolevel assumption is very commonly assumed in the literature @xcite , but it is seldom checked . as far as we know",

    ".   has been used .",
    "let us recall here that this _ distance _ , denoted by @xmath41 , profits from the complex nature of the system studied to compare any two different potential energy functions , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . from a working set of conformations ( in this case , the 144 points of each pes )",
    ", it statistically measures the typical error that one makes in the _ energy differences _ if @xmath43 is used instead of the more accurate @xmath42 , admitting a linear rescaling and a shift in the energy reference .",
    "this distance , which has energy units , presents better properties than other quantities customarily used to perform these comparisons , such as the energy rmsd , the average energy error , etc . , and it may be related to the pearson s correlation coefficient @xmath44 by    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the standard deviation of @xmath47 in the working set .    also , due to its physical meaning , it has been argued in ref .",
    "that , if the distance between two different approximations of the energy of the same system is less than @xmath48 , one may safely substitute one by the other without altering the relevant dynamical or thermodynamical behaviour .",
    "consequently , we shall present the results in units of @xmath48 ( at , so that @xmath49 kcal / mol ) .",
    "finally , if one assumes that the effective energies compared will be used to construct a polypeptide potential and that it will be designed as simply the sum of mono - residue ones @xcite , then , the number @xmath50 of residues up to which one may go keeping the distance @xmath41 between the two approximations of the the @xmath1-residue potential below @xmath48 is @xcite    @xmath51    now , according to the value taken by @xmath50 for a comparison between a fixed reference pes , denoted by @xmath52 , and a candidate approximation , denoted by @xmath47 , we divide all the efficiency plots in sec  [ sec : pess_results ] in three regions depending on the accuracy : the _ protein region _ , corresponding to @xmath53 , or , equivalently , to @xmath54 ; the _ peptide region _ , corresponding to @xmath55 , or @xmath56 ; and , finally , the _ inaccurate region _ , where @xmath57 , and even for a dipeptide it is not advisable to use @xmath47 as an approximation to  @xmath52 .      in the whole study presented in this work , only pople s split - valence basis sets @xcite have been investigated . among the many reasons behind this choice , we would like to mention the following ones :    * they are very popular and they are implemented in almost every quantum chemistry package , in such a way that they are readily available for most researchers and the results here may be easily checked or extended .",
    "* there exist a lot of data calculated using these basis sets in the literature , so that the knowledge about their behaviour in different problems is constantly growing and may also be enriched by the study presented here . *",
    "pople s split - valence basis sets incorporate , and hence allow to investigate , most of the features and improvements that are commonly used in the literature , such as contraction , valence - splitting , diffuse functions and polarizations .",
    "* unlike some other popular basis sets , such as dunning s correlation - consistent family @xcite , in which the diffuse or polarization functions are added in preset groups , pople s basis sets allow for the addition of individual shells rather independently , thus permitting a more in depth study . * the number of different basis sets available is very large ( see , for example the emsl database at ` http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/forms/basisform .",
    "html ` ) , so that , for obvious computational reasons , one can not explore them all , and some choice must be made .",
    "now , even restricting oneself to this particular family of basis sets , the number of variants that can be formed by independently adding each type of diffuse or polarization function to each one of the basic 6 - 31 g and 6 - 311 g sets is huge ( to get to the sought point , there is no need to consider the addition of functions to 3 - 21 g , 4 - 31 g , etc . ) .",
    "using that the largest set of diffuse and polarization shells that we may add is the ` + + g(3df,3pd ) ' one @xcite , we can express the different basis sets that may be constructed as a product of all the independent possibilities :    @xmath58    where the dot @xmath59 indicates here that no function is added from a particular group .",
    "therefore , there are @xmath60 different pople s split - valence basis sets just considering the 6 - 31 g and 6 - 311 g families .",
    "this number is prohibitively large to carry out a full study even at the rhf level , so that , here , the following strategy has been devised to render the investigation feasible :    to begin with , we impose several constraints on the basis sets that will be considered in a first stage :    lll +   + 3 - 21 g & 6 - 31 g & 6 - 311 g + 3 - 21g(d , p ) & 6 - 31g(d , p ) & 6 - 311g(d , p ) + 3 - 21++g & 6 - 31g(2d,2p ) & 6 - 311g(2d,2p ) + 3 - 21++g(d , p ) & 6 - 31g(2df,2pd ) & 6 - 311g(2df,2pd ) + 4 - 31 g & 6 - 31++g & 6 - 311++g + 4 - 31g(d , p ) & 6 - 31++g(d , p ) & 6 - 311++g(d , p ) + 4 - 31++g & 6 - 31++g(2d,2p ) & 6 - 311++g(2d,2p ) + 4 - 31++g(d , p ) & 6 - 31++g(2df,2pd ) & * 6 - 311++g(2df,2pd ) * +   +   + 6 - 31+g(d , p ) & 6 - 31++g(d ) & 6 - 31g(f , d ) + 6 - 31@xmath59+g(d , p ) & 6 - 31++g(@xmath59,p ) & +   +   + 4 - 31g(d ) & 6 - 311g(d ) & 6 - 31g(d ) + 4 - 31+g(d ) & 6 - 311+g(d ) & 6 - 31+g(d ) + 4 - 31+g(d , p ) & 6 - 311+g(d , p ) & + 4 - 31++g(d ) & 6 - 311++g(d ) & +    1 .",
    "the maximum set of diffuse and polarization shells added is ` + + g(2df , 2pd ) ' , instead of ` + + g(3df,3pd ) ' .",
    "this is consistent with the thumb - rule concept of _ balance _",
    "@xcite , according to which , the most efficient ( _ balanced _ ) basis sets are typically those that contain , for each angular momentum @xmath61 , one shell more than the ones included for  @xmath62 ; so that 6 - 311++g(3df,3pd ) , for example , should be regarded as _",
    "unbalanced_. 2 .",
    "there must be the same number and type of shells in hydrogens as in 1st - row atoms .",
    "this has to be interpreted in the proper way : for example , if we add two d - type polarization shells to 1st - row atoms , we must add two p - type ones to hydrogens .",
    "they are of the same type in the sense that they are one momentum angular unit larger than the largest one in the respective valence shell .",
    "the higher angular momentum f - type ( for 1st - row atoms ) and d - type shells ( for hydrogens ) , are not included unless the lower polarizations are doubly split , i.e. , unless we have already included the ( 2d,2p)-shells . this is again consistent with the balance rule mentioned in point ( i ) .",
    "the investigation of smaller basis sets is restricted to the 3 - 21 g and families , and the largest set of extra shells that is added to them is ` + + g(d , p ) ' . for consistence ,",
    "the diffuse and polarization functions used for and 4 - 31 g are the same as the ones for 6 - 31 g and @xcite .",
    "these _ rules _ , most of which are typically obeyed ( often tacitly ) in the literature @xcite , produce the list of 24 basis sets labeled as ` first - stage , rules - complying basis sets ' in table  [ tab : basis_sets ] and depicted as black circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : basis_sets ] .",
    "basis sets investigated in this work .",
    "they are organized in three groups : the first one , depicted as _ black circles _ , contains the basis sets that comply with some heuristic restrictions commonly found in the literature ; in the second group , represented as _ grey - filled circles _ , these restrictions are broken in an exploratory manner ; finally , in the third group , shown as _ white - filled circles _ , 10 new basis sets are selected according to what has been learned by violating the rules . in * ( a ) *",
    ", a general view of all the 39 basis sets is presented , while in * ( b ) * , the left - most region of the 6 - 31 g family has been enlarged so that the basis sets belonging to the second and third groups could be more easily appreciated .",
    "the dot @xmath59 is used to indicate that no shell of a particular type is added to the 1st - row atoms , and the geometric arrangement of the basis sets has no deep meaning whatsoever , it is only intended to provide visual comfort .",

    "even if their exhaustive study is already a demanding computational task and the space of all pople s split - valence basis sets may be thought to be reasonably sampled by this ` first - stage ' group , we wanted to check the validity of some of the rules , since , in the same spirit of the arguments given in the introduction , what is good for a particular system or a particular purpose is not necessarily good for a different one , which may be far away from the native playground where the methods have been traditionally tested and parameterized .",
    "therefore , to this end , we have chosen the medium - sized and reasonably rhf - efficient 6 - 31++g(d , p ) basis set ( see sec .",

    "this second modification is so unusual ( in fact , we have not found any work where it is performed ) that there is no notation for it in the literature ; herein , a dot @xmath59 is used in the place where the unexisting 1st - row - atom shell would appear . on the other hand , as a representant of breaking rule  ( iii ) , we have selected 6 - 31g(f , d ) .",

    "[ fig : basis_sets ] .",
    "we have decided to violate neither rule  ( i ) , mainly for computational reasons , nor rule ( iv ) , due to the fact that the study of the smaller basis sets is intended to be only exploratory ( and , in any case , the 3 - 21 g and 4 - 31 g families have proved to be rather inefficient for this problem ; see sec .",

    "therefore , _ we discourage the use of rhf@xmath11rhf mcs for peptides _ , and , unless otherwise stated , most of the conclusions below should be understood as referring either to mp2@xmath11mp2-intramethod or to mp2@xmath11rhf - intermethod mcs , which have proved to be acceptably accurate with respect to the best mp2 calculation .",
    "the second observation related to the comparison between rhf and mp2 is that _ the transferability of the relative accuracies between mcs is imperfect _ , and the conclusions regarding the relative efficiency of the different basis sets arrived using the former can not be directly extrapolated to the latter .",

    "now , keeping these considerations in mind , let us summarize the most important conclusions pertaining the relative efficiency of the pople split - valence basis sets investigated :    * in the whole study , the polarization shells in 1st - row atoms have been shown to be essential to accurately account for both the conformational dependence of the geometry and of the energy of the system . except for some particular mcs with 3 - 21 g geometries , which may be used if we plan to describe short oligopeptides , _ our recommendation is that polarization functions in 1st - row atoms be included_. * in most cases , we have also observed a strong signal indicating that _ no basis sets should be used containing doubly - split polarization shells and no diffuse functions_. * _ the _ 6 - 31g(d ) _ basis set _ , which is frequently used in the literature , @xcite , _ has turned out to be a very efficient one for calculating the geometry both at rhf and mp2_. * regarding the basis set convergence issue , we can conclude that , _ for the largest basis sets in the pople split - valence family , both the rhf and mp2 infinite basis set limits are approximately reached_. * finally , some _ weaker signals _ have been observed suggesting that to add higher angular momentum polarization shells ( f , d ) before adding the lower ones may be inefficient , that it is not recommendable to put polarization or diffuse functions on hydrogens only , and that it may be efficient in some cases to add diffuse functions to singly - polarized basis sets .    referring to the heterolevel assumption , which , as far as we are aware , has been tested in this work for the first time in full pess :    * as a general and very clear conclusion , since only some small - basis set homolevels lie in the lower - left envelope of the efficiency plots presented in the previous sections , and , in all cases , it happens for distances @xmath41 greater than @xmath48 , we can say that _ the heterolevel assumption is correct for the description of the conformational behaviour of the system studied here with mp2@xmath11mp2 and mp2@xmath11rhf mcs _ ( also for rhf@xmath11rhf - heterolevels but , as we remarked above , this has little computational interest ) . * due to the much stronger dependence of the accuracy of mcs on the level used for the single - point than on the one used for the geometry optimization , together with the lower computational cost of the former ,",
    "_ the general recommendation is that the greatest computational effort be dedicated to the energy calculation_. * despite this general thumb rule , and under the assumptions in sec .",
    "[ subsec : pess_distance ] , _ if one wants to approximate the mp2 reference calculation for peptides of more than 100 residues , the geometry must be calculated using mp2_. nevertheless , with small and cheap basis sets , such as 6 - 31g(d ) , the mp2@xmath11mp2 results can be good enough at a low computational cost .",
    "finally , let us remark that the investigation performed here has been done in one of the simplest dipeptides . the fact that we have treated it as an isolated system , the small size of its side chain and also its aliphatic character , all play a role in the results obtained .",

    "<S> the most important results of the study are the following : first , that the convergence in method is not achieved in the step . </S>",
    "<S> second that the transferability of basis set accuracy from rhf to mp2 is imperfect . </S>",
    "<S> these two conclusions lead us to discourage the use of rhf mcs for peptides . </S>",
    "<S> regarding the relative efficiency of the pople s basis sets , we recommend the inclusion of polarization functions in 1st - row atoms and we discourage the use of basis sets containing doubly - split polarization shells and no diffuse functions . </S>",
    "<S> also , we have found that 6 - 31g(d ) is very efficient for calculating the geometry , and that both the rhf and mp2 infinite basis set limits are approximately reached at 6 - 311++g(2df,2pd ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , related to the heterolevel approximation , we conclude that it is essentially correct for the description of the conformational behaviour of hco - l - ala - nh@xmath0 both at rhf and mp2 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we place a cautionary remark on the use of rhf geometries with mp2 single - points : whereas this practice could be accurate enough for short peptides , the accumulation of errors may render it unreliable for longer chains and require the use of mp2 geometries . </S>",
