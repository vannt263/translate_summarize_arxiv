    "in recent years there have been a huge interest in quantum plasmas because they can be important in different scenarios , for example in astrophysical systems @xcite or high - energy lasers @xcite .",
    "typically , for a plasma with number density @xmath0 , the quantum effects are relevant when the thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath1 of the plasma constituents is similar to or larger than the average interparticle distance @xmath2 , i.e. when @xmath3 .",
    "fluid plasma models have been developed to introduce the quantum effects of its constituents @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the equation of motion for particles has two main quantum corrections .",
    "one is a quantum force produced by density fluctuations , which has its origin in the so - called bohm potential @xcite .",
    "the another one is owing to the spin of particles which is considered in the equation of motion through the magnetization energy .",
    "besides , the spin has its own equation which contains a classical evolution plus a quantum correction to its dynamics . using this new formalism ,",
    "quantum multi - fluid and quantum magnetohydrodynamic models have been proposed @xcite .",
    "propagation of different waves have been studied using these fluid models .",
    "quantum corrections have been found for classical dispersion relations , either with only bohm potential or with bohm and spin contributions .",
    "for example , it has been studied linear waves @xcite , low - frequency waves @xcite , wave modes for dusty plasmas @xcite , nonlinear waves @xcite , shock waves @xcite and solitons @xcite .    the quantum effects on the oblique propagation of magnetosonic waves have been studied previously for electron - positron - ion and dust - electron - ion plasmas @xcite , where only the force due to the bohm potential was included but the spin effect was not considered . in this manuscript , we study the quantum effects introduced by both the bohm potential and the spin of electrons in the oblique propagation of low - frequency magnetosonic waves in a warm magnetoplasma composed by mobile ions and electrons .",
    "an angle @xmath4 measures how oblique is the direction of propagation of the wave with respect to a background magnetic field .",
    "the aim of our analysis is to investigate how quantum effects change for the different types of low - frequency propagation .",
    "we consider a two - fluid plasma model composed by mobile ions and electrons .",
    "this model follows the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite for spin quantum plasmas .",
    "thus , the electron specie contains both quantum effects , bohm potential and spin force , while for the ions we neglect the quantum contributions due to their inertia . in our system",
    ", we use the subindex @xmath5 or @xmath6 to identify the ion or electron species .",
    "we assume that the amplitude of oscillation are small , thus we can solve the system using linearized equations .",
    "the plasma equilibrium is assumed to have null zeroth order velocities for both species , @xmath7 .",
    "thus , at first order , the continuity equations for ions and electrons are @xmath8 respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the equal equilibrium number density for ions and electrons which allows quasi - neutrality . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the first order number density perturbations of ions and electrons respectively , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the first order velocity perturbations of ions and electrons respectively .    the plasma is embedded in a constant background magnetic field @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the equation of motion for ions at first order is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ion mass , @xmath6 is the electron charge , @xmath17 is the polytropic index for the ion fluid , @xmath18 is the ion fluid temperature , @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath20 is the speed of light .",
    "the pressure is related the density through the equation of state @xmath21 .",
    "the first order equation of motion for electrons is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the electron mass , @xmath24 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath25 is the polytropic index for the electron fluid and @xmath26 is the electron fluid temperature ( for a fermionic plasma , the temperature @xmath26 is replaced by the fermi electron temperature @xmath27 with @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 is the electron magnetic moment and the spin @xmath30 is considered as a constant .",
    "the third and fourth terms at the right - hand side of eq .",
    "correspond to the first order quantum corrections to the equation of motion of electrons @xcite .",
    "the third term is the bohm potential and the fourth term is the spin correction to the fluid dynamics .",
    "this last term is associated to the magnetization energy of the electrons due to the electron 1/2-spin effect @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic wave is governed by the maxwell equations @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total current density , and @xmath34 is the magnetization spin current @xcite .",
    "this current is necessary for that the maxwell equations take in account the spin sources of the plasma constituents .",
    "now , we choose the external magnetic field as @xmath35 with respect of the propagation direction determined by the wavenumber @xmath36 of the wave .",
    "the spin of the electrons is @xmath37 , antiparallel to the background magnetic field .",
    "this minimizes the magnetic moment energy .",
    "the function @xmath38 is the brillouin function due to the magnetization of a spin distribution in thermodynamic equilibrium with @xmath39 .",
    "this function appears as the solution of the spin evolution equation for spin quantum plasmas where the spin inertia and the spin - thermal coupling terms are neglected @xcite .    the first order electromagnetic fields are @xmath40 and @xmath41 . assuming that the first order perturbations are proportional to @xmath42 $ ] ( where @xmath43 is the wave frequency ) , then the continuity equations for ions and electrons can be linearized as @xmath44    in the same way , the linearized equations of motion and becomes @xmath45 @xmath46    the general dispersion relation can be found solving the linearized version of eqs .",
    " and maxwell equations and , using the magnetization spin current is @xmath47 .",
    "the above equations can be solved to find the dispersion relation    @xmath48\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\omega_p^2\\left[1+\\frac{2\\omega_c\\eta(\\alpha)\\mu c k^2 \\sin^2\\theta } { e\\omega^2(1-a_e)}+\\frac{\\eta(\\alpha)^2\\mu^2 c^2 k^4 \\sin^2\\theta}{e^2\\omega^2(1-a_e)}\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega_c^2}{\\omega^2}\\cos^2\\theta\\right)\\right]\\left[\\frac{\\omega^2(1-a_e)}{\\omega^2(1-a_e)-\\omega_c^2+\\omega_c^2\\cos^2\\theta a_e}\\right]\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\label{relacdispersion1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the ion and electron plasma frequency respectively , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the ion and electron cyclotron frequency respectively .",
    "we have defined the adimensional quantities @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the dispersion relation is general for any angle .",
    "the quantum corrections appear due to the spin effects , which are proportional to @xmath56 , and due to the bohm potential effect through the correction of @xmath57 order in the definition of @xmath58 .    from this result , we derive the low - frequency modes with the aim of to understand how the spin and the bohm potential affect the propagation modes at different angles .      from the complete electromagnetic propagation mode ,",
    "the magnetosonic wave is obtained as the low - frequency electromagnetic wave which propagates perpendicular to the background magnetic field ( @xmath60 ) . in this case",
    ", it appears the @xmath61 drift along the propagation direction due to the interaction of the electric field and the background magnetic field .",
    "it causes that the plasma will be compressed and released during the oscillations @xcite . and , therefore , the pressure gradient force term in the equation of motion are important in this mode .    to study the low - frequency mode , we take the limit of small electron mass such that @xmath62 .",
    "when we treat with classical plasmas we require that @xmath63 , however when the quantum effects are considered , the low - frequency limit is obtained when @xmath64 owing to the @xmath57 term in @xmath58 can be important for large @xmath65 . assuming besides that @xmath66 , such that @xmath67 can be neglected relative to @xmath68 , the dispersion relation becomes @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the alfvn velocity , @xmath71 is the acoustic speed , and @xmath72 is a spin - modified alfvn velocity @xmath73    the dispersion relation is for a simple magnetosonic wave which propagates perpendicular to an external magnetic field in a quantum plasma .",
    "the dispersion relation has two quantum corrections .",
    "the first correction in is due to the spin .",
    "this is a constant correction to the alfvn velocity where the effect of the spin of electrons produces a contribution to the linear part of the magnetosonic mode defining the spin - modified alfvn velocity .",
    "the correction to the alfvn velocity can be relevant for very dense plasmas . for astrophysical plasmas such as pulsar magnetospheres with @xmath74 , @xmath75 and temperature of @xmath76 @xcite , then @xmath77 , which is a reduction in @xmath78% of the alfvn velocity .",
    "on the other hand , the other quantum correction is owing to the bohm potential and to the spin .",
    "this is a no constant correction that produces a contribution of @xmath79 order , and it depends on the both ion and electron masses . classically the magnetosonic mode is a lineal mode , but the quantum corrections produces a nonlinear contribution that can be important for large @xmath65 .",
    "asociated to this correction appears the effect of the spin through the term",
    "@xmath80 which is always positive",
    ". thus , the spin decreases the contribution of the bohm potential to the mode .    to this quantum correction",
    "be relevant in a quantum magnetoplasma , @xmath65 must be of the order @xmath81 .",
    "for example , @xmath82 for the same previous values for the density and for the magnetic field , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "when there are no background magnetic field , the effect of spin vanish , but the quantum correction due to the bohm potential will not vanish because it is independent to the coupling to the magnetic field . on the other hand , classical results are recovered when @xmath83 , obtaining the well - known relation dispersion for classical magnetosonic modes @xcite .",
    "the classical and the quantum corrected modes are shown in the fig .  [ figura1 ] , where we plot the dispersion relation in full line to compare its behavior with the classical dispersion relation [ @xmath83 in ec .  ] which is in dashed line .",
    "the values of magnetic field and number density is choosen for some magnetized dense astrophysical plasma",
    ". these are @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the bohm potential becomes important for @xmath86 , where the dispersion relation start to show a cuadratic behavior .",
    "the most remarkable effects of quantum contribution is the increase in the effective group velocity @xmath87 of this mode .",
    "this happen because the term proportional to @xmath79 in whose origin is the bohm potential .",
    "the implications of this quantum behavior in possible anomalous disperion regions are under study .",
    "besides , this effect in the phase and group velocities can lead to very exciting implications . for example , similar dispersion relations have been obtained for bose - einstein condensates where it is shown the existence of analogue black holes due to this quantum effect @xcite .",
    "dispersion relation in full line , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 , with the frequency @xmath43 and the wavenumber @xmath65 .",
    "the dashed line is the classical relation dispersion .",
    "we have used @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath90.,height=188 ]    it is interesting to mention that when @xmath91 , which is fulfilled for most plasmas , then we can approximate @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the spin - modified alfvn velocity becomes in @xmath93 , which coincides with the definition for the spin - modified alfvn velocity given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    ", the quantum correction can be relevant if the number density is of order @xmath94 .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath95 , then @xmath96 , and the effect of the bohm potential vanish leaving the spin - modified alfvn velocity @xmath97 as the only quantum correction to the magnetosonic wave .",
    "when the propation of the wave is parallel to the background magnetic field ( @xmath99 ) , the low - frequency limit is taken from the dispersion relation with @xmath98 . in this case , the spin contributions vanish and the bohm potential corrections are simplified from the dispersion relation .",
    "the low - frequency mode is obtained when @xmath66 , @xmath62 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 . under this limit",
    ", the dispersion relation will be @xmath102 .",
    "this is the same result than for a classical alfvn propagation mode .",
    "this is because of that the spin will be parallel to the background magnetic field and , therefore it does not couple with the perturbed magnetic field .      in general ,",
    "the low - frequency limit of the electromagnetic wave can be obtained for any angle . as illustration",
    ", we consider the case of oblique propagation with @xmath103 .",
    "for this case , we do again @xmath66 and @xmath62 . after a straightforward algebra and assuming that @xmath100 and @xmath104",
    ", we finally obtain a complicated dispersion relation for this low - frequency mode @xmath105    for this oblique propagation , the temperature of the ion fluid and of the electron fluid play an interesting role in the dispersion relation .",
    "the ion temperature appears modifying in some sense the effective value of the aflvn velocity . on the other hand ,",
    "the bohm potential is coupled to the spin in the sense that if the spin is neglected , then the bohm potential term does not appear . besides",
    ", the electron temperature is related with the spin and the bohm potential .",
    "these are the main differences between this mode and the perpendicular propagation where the quantum contributions are independent of each other and both effects are independent from the temperature .",
    "when both quantum effects , spin and bohm potential , are ignored , we can recover the dispersion relation @xmath106 in the limit @xmath107 .",
    "the quantum and the classical dispersion relations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figura2 ] in full and dashed lines respectively .",
    "we have used the same previous values for the density and for the background magnetic field .",
    "dispersion relation in full line , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the dashed line is the classical relation dispersion @xmath106 .",
    "we have used @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath90.,height=188 ]    as in the case for perpendicular propagation , the quantum effects produce an increasing in the effective group velocity of the oblique linear mode . but this increasing is not enough to produce an anomalous dispersion effect , because this group velocity is less than @xmath20 .",
    "we have derived the quantum corrections to the propagation of low - frequency magnetosonic waves composed of mobile electrons and ions .",
    "these corrections are due to bohm potential and to spin of electrons , both of @xmath57 order .",
    "it was shown how contribution of both quantum effects change depending on the angle of the oblique propagation .",
    "for perpendicular propagation , the quantum correction associated to the bohm potential introduces a non linear term which appears as an contribution of @xmath79 order in the dispersion relation .",
    "the spin of electrons produces a contribution to the alvn velocity which is a correction to the linear part of the dispersion relation .",
    "the quantum effects does not affect the parallel propagation at low - frequency . otherwise , for every other angle , quantum effects shown a complicated coupled to the thermal effects . in particular for @xmath103 , the quantum contribution increase the value of the group velocity .",
    "in fact , this increasing is obtained for any angle @xmath108 . for example , for a very small angle @xmath109 , then the dispersion relation becomes @xmath110 $ ] , showing that the spin can introduces quantum correction to the propagation even at small oblique angles ."
