    "there is little question that the computer has caused a profound change in society . at our fingertips",
    "are devices that are performing billions of computations a second , and the same is true of embedded devices in all manner of things . in the same way that much of mathematics was developed to understand the physics of the world around us , developing mathematics to understand computation is an imperative .",
    "it is little wonder that the famous @xmath0 question is one of the clay prize questions and is regarded by some as the single most important problem in mathematics .",
    "this question is one in _ complexity theory _ which seeks to understand the _ resources _ ( such as time or space ) needed for computation .",
    "the goal of this paper is to describe the methods and development of an area of complexity theory called _",
    "parameterized complexity_. this is a _ fine - grained _ complexity analysis which is often more attuned to analyzing computational questions which arise _ in practice _ than traditional worst case analysis .",
    "the idea here is that if you are working in some computational science and wish to understand what is _",
    "_ feasible _ _ in your area , then perhaps this is the methodology you should know .    as articulated by the first author in  @xcite",
    ", people working in the area tend to be a bit schizophrenic in that , even in computer science , paper reviews range from saying that `` parameterized complexity is now well known so why are you including this introductory stuff ? '' , to the other extreme where reviewers say that they have never heard about it .",
    "whilst the use of parameterized complexity in applications has been growing at a very fast rate , there still remain significant groups who seem unaware of the techniques and ideas of the area .",
    "everyone , apparently , is aware of np - completeness and seems vaguely aware of randomized or approximation techniques .",
    "however , this seems not to be the case yet for parameterized complexity and/or algorithms .",
    "moreover , it is certainly not the case that parameterized complexity has become part of the standard curriculum of theoretical computer science as something all researchers in complexity should know .      in the first book on the subject by downey and fellows",
    "@xcite , much is made of the issue `` what is the role of complexity theory ? '' .",
    "after the work of alan turing and others in the mid-20th century , we understand what it means for something to be computable .",
    "but for _ _ actual _ _ computations , it is not enough to know that the problem is computable in theory . if we need to compute something it is not good if the running time will be so large that no computer ever conceived will be able to run the computation in the life time of the universe",
    "hence , the _ _ goal _ _ is to understand what is _ _",
    "feasible__. the point is that for _ _ any _ _ combinatorial problem , we will deal with only a small finite fraction of the universe , so how do we quantify this notion of feasibility ?",
    "classically , this is achieved by identifying _ _ feasibility _ _ with _ _ polynomial - time computability . _ _",
    "when we first learn of this , many of us immediately think of polynomial like @xmath1 and say `` surely that is not feasible ! '' .",
    "we tend to forget that , because of such intuitive objections , the original suggestions that asymptotic analysis was a reasonable way to measure complexity and polynomial time was a reasonable measure of feasibility , were initially quite controversial .",
    "the reasons that the now central ideas of asymptotic polynomial time ( p - time ) and np - completeness have survived the test of time are basically two .",
    "firstly , the methodologies associated with polynomial - time and p - time reductions have proved to be readily amenable to mathematical analysis in most situations . in a word",
    ", p has good closure properties .",
    "it offers a readily negotiable mathematical currency . secondly , and even more importantly",
    ", the ideas seem to work _ _ in practice _ _ :",
    "for `` natural '' problems the universe seems _ _ kind _ _ in the sense that ( at least historically ) if a `` natural '' computational problem is in p then usually we can find an algorithm having a polynomial running time with small degree and small constants .",
    "this last point , while seeming a religious , rather than a mathematical , statement , seems the key driving force behind the universal use of p as a classification tool for `` natural '' problems .    even granting this ,",
    "the use of things like np - completeness is a very coarse tool .",
    "we are given some problem and show that it is np - complete .",
    "what to do ? as pointed out in garey and johnson @xcite , this is only an initial foray .",
    "all such a result says is that our hope for an exact algorithm for the general problem which is feasible is likely in vain .",
    "the problem with the standard approach of showing np - completeness is that it offers no methodology of seeking practical and feasible algorithms for more restricted versions of the problem which might be both relevant and feasible .",
    "as we will see , parameterized complexity seeks to have a conversation with the problem which enables us to do just that .",
    "the idea behind parameterized complexity is that we should look more deeply into the actual _ _ structure _ _ of the problem in order to seek some kind of hidden feasibility .",
    "classical complexity views a problem as an instance and a question .",
    "the running time is specified by the input s size .",
    "+ _ question : _ when will the input of a problem coming from `` real life '' have no more structure than its size ?    _ answer : _ _ never ! _ + for real - world computations we _ _ always _ _ know more about the problem .",
    "the problem is planar , the problem has small width , the problem only concerns small values of the parameters .",
    "cities are regular , objects people construct tend to be built in some comprehensible way from smaller ones constructed earlier , people s minds do not tend to work with more than a few alternations of quantifiers , etc .",
    "thus , _ _ why not have a complexity theory which exploits these structural parameters ? _ _ _ _ why not have a complexity theory more _ _ fine - tuned _ _ to actual applications ? _ _",
    "before we launch into examples and definitions , we make some remarks about what this article offers .",
    "the area of parameterized complexity ( as an explicit discipline ) has been around for around 20 years .",
    "the group or researchers who have adopted the methodology most strongly are those ( particularly in europe ) who are working in _ _ applications__. what has emerged is a very rich collection of distinctive positive techniques which should be known to researchers in computational applications in areas as diverse as linguistics , biology , cognition , physics , etc .",
    "the point here is that once you focus on a an extended `` computational dialog '' with the problem new techniques emerge around this .",
    "these techniques vary from simple ( and practical ) local reduction rules ( for example karsten weihe s solution to the `` europe train station problem '' @xcite ) to some which are highly theoretical and use some very deep mathematics ( for example , the recent proof that topological embedding is fixed - parameter tractable by grohe , kawarabayashi , marx , and wollan @xcite , which uses most of the structure theory of the graph minors project of robertson and seymour  @xcite ) .",
    "the second part of this article looks at these positive techniques systematically , and we hope that the reader will find useful tools there . this area is still rapidly developing , and there are many internal contests amongst the researchers to develop techniques to beat existing bounds .",
    "for further details , the reader can see the web site http://fpt.wikidot.com/[http://fpt.wikidot.com/ ]  .    the first part of the article is devoted to limitations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the area is concerned with tractability _ _ within polynomial time . _",
    "_ hence classical methods do not readily apply .",
    "the question is `` how does the problem resides in polynomial time '' . to illustrate this , we begin with the basic motivating examples .",
    "+ vertex cover - vertex cover , but this seems unnecessarily notational .",
    "we will usually supress the aspect of the problem being regarded as a parameter , or even that the problem is considered as a parameterized one when the context is clear .",
    "we believe that this will aide the general readability of the paper . ]",
    "+ _ instance : _",
    "a graph @xmath2 .",
    "+ _ parameter : _ a positive integer @xmath3 .",
    "+ _ question : _  does @xmath4 have a vertex cover of size @xmath5 ?",
    "( a _ vertex cover _ of a graph @xmath4 is a set @xmath6 such that for all edges @xmath7 of @xmath4 , either @xmath8 or @xmath9 . )",
    "+ dominating set + _ instance : _ a graph @xmath4 .",
    "+ _ parameter : _ a positive integer @xmath3 .",
    "+ _ question : _ does @xmath4 have a dominating set of size @xmath3 ? ( a _ dominating set _ is a set @xmath6 where , for each @xmath10 there is a @xmath11 such that @xmath12 . )",
    "+ of course both of these problems ( without the parameter ) are famously np - complete by the work of karp  @xcite . with the parameter _",
    "_ then both of the problems are in polynomial time simply by trying all of the @xmath13 subsets of size @xmath3 where @xmath14 is the number of vertices of the input graph @xmath4 .",
    "what we now know is that there is an algorithm running in time @xmath15 ( see @xcite ) ( i.e. , linear time for a fixed @xmath3 and with an additive component that is mildly exponential in @xmath3 ) , whereas the only known algorithm for dominating set is to try all possibilities .",
    "this takes time more or less @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , we remark that the methods for solving vertex cover are simple reduction rules which are `` industrial strength '' in that they run extremely well in practice ( e.g. @xcite ) , even for @xmath3 beyond which would seem reasonable , like @xmath17 .",
    "the reader might wonder : does this matter ?",
    "table [ table3 ] from the original book @xcite illustrates the difference between a running time of @xmath18 ( that is , where exaustive search is necessary ) and a running time of @xmath19 .",
    "the latter has been achieved for several natural parameterized problems .",
    "( in fact , as we have seen above , the constant @xmath20 can sometimes be significantly improved and its contribution can sometimes even be additive . )    even before we give the formal definitions , the intent of the definitions will be clear . if we have algorithms running in time @xmath21 , for some @xmath22 that is independent of @xmath3 , we regard this as being ( fixed - parameter ) tractable , and if @xmath22 increases with @xmath3 , then this problem is regarded as being intractable . in the latter case ,",
    "we can not usually prove intractability as it would separate p from np , as it would in the case of dominating set , for example .",
    "but we can have a _ _ completeness programme _ _ in the same spirit as np - completeness .",
    "we mention that the methodology has deep connections with classical complexity .",
    "for example , one of the more useful assumptions for establishing lower bounds in classical complexity is what is called the _ _ exponential time hypothesis _ _ ( eth ) which is that not only is @xmath14-variable 3sat not in polynomial time , but in fact it does not have an algorithm running in subexponential time .",
    "( impagliazzo , paturi and zane @xcite ) . with this hypothesis ,",
    "many lower bounds can be made rather sharp . recently",
    "chen and grohe demonstrated an isomorphism between subexponential time complexity and parameterized complexity @xcite .",
    "the connection between subexponential time complexity and parameterized complexity was noticed long ago by abrahamson , downey and fellows @xcite .",
    "another notable connection is with _ _",
    "polynomial time approximation schemes__. here the idea is to give a solution which is approximate to within @xmath23 of the correct solution .",
    "often the pcp theorem allows us to show that no such approximation scheme exists unless p@xmath24np .",
    "but sometimes they do , but can have awful running times .",
    "for example , here is a table from downey @xcite :    * arora @xcite gave a @xmath25 ptas for euclidean tsp * chekuri and khanna @xcite gave a @xmath26 ptas for multiple knapsack * shamir and tsur @xcite gave a @xmath27 ptas for maximum subforest * chen and miranda @xcite gave a @xmath28 ptas for general multiprocessor job scheduling * erlebach _ et al . _",

    "finally , before we move to formal definitions , we mention other strategies which attempt to understand what is feasible .",
    "one that springs to mind is the theory of average - case complexity .",
    "this has not really been widely applied as the distributions seem rather difficult to apply .",
    "similar comments apply to the theory of smoothed analysis .",
    "in fact one of the reasons that parameterized complexity has been used so often in practice is that it is widely applicable .",
    "we also mention that often it can be used to explain unexpected tractability of algorithms .",
    "sometimes they seem to work because of underlying hidden parameters in the input .",
    "for example , the number of `` lets '' in some structured programming languages in practice is usually bounded by some constant , and sometimes engineering considerations make sure that , for example , the number of wafers in vlsi design is small .",
    "it is even conceivable there might be a parametric explanation of the tractability of the simplex algorithm .",
    "if the reader finds this all useful , then we refer him / her to two recent issues of the _ _ the computer journal _ _ @xcite devoted to aspects and applications of parameterized complexity , to the survey of downey and mccartin @xcite on parameterized algorithms , the ( somewhat dated ) survey downey @xcite for issues in complexity , and other articles such as @xcite as well as the books by downey and fellows @xcite , niedermeier @xcite and flum and grohe @xcite .",

    "not _ _ have the same parameterized complexity . in subsection [ w_hiera ]",

    "this technique is widely used in practice as it usually relies on a number of easily implementable reduction rules as we will discuss in subsection [ kernelization ] .",
    "we will look at recent techniques which say when this technique can be used to give @xmath45 as above with @xmath46 polynomially bounded .",
    "the final part of the complexity section deals with _ _ some _ _ of the other classes we have left out .    in section [ algorithms ] , we turn to techniques for the design of parameterized algorithms .",
    "we will focus mainly on graphs ; for to lack of space we do not discuss too many applications , except _ _ en passant__.    the principal contributor of high running times in classical algorithms comes from branching , and large search trees .",
    "for this reason we begin by looking at methods which restrict the branching in subection [ derand ] , including bounded search trees and greedy localization .",
    "then in subection [ fasoc ] we look at the use of automata and logic in the design of parameterized algorithms .    in turn",
    "this leads to meta - theoretical methods such as applications of courcelle s theorem on graphs of bounded treewidth , and other methods such as local treewidth and first order logic ( fol ) .",
    "this is discussed in subection [ cource ] and [ ftpfol ] .    in subections [ graphminors ] and [ irrelevant ]",
    "we look at the highly impractical , but powerful methods emerging from the graph minors project .",
    "later , we examine how these methods can be sped up .",
    "having worked in the stratosphere of algorithm design we return to focus on singly - exponential algorithm design techniques such as iterative compression , bidimensionality theory , and then in subsection [ kernelization ] move to kernelization , and finish with variations .    of course , often we will use all of this in combination . for example , we might kernelize , then begin a branch tree of some bounded size , and the rekernelize the smaller graphs .",
    "it is often the case that this method is provably faster and certainly this is how it it is often done in practice .",
    "however , we do not have space in this already long paper to discuss such refinements in more detail .",
    "the first thing to do is to define a proper notion of tractability for parameterized problems .",
    "this induces the definition of the parametrized complexity class fpt , namely the class of fixed - parameter tractable problems .",
    "a _ parameterized problem _ ( also called _ parameterized language _ ) is a subset @xmath47 of @xmath48 where @xmath49 is some alphabet . in the input @xmath50 of a parameterized problem ,",
    "we call @xmath51 as the",
    "_ main part of the input _ and @xmath3 as the _ parameter of the input_. we also agree that @xmath52 .",
    "we say that @xmath47 is _ fixed parameter tractable _ if there exists a function @xmath53 and an algorithm deciding whether @xmath54 in @xmath55 steps , where @xmath22 is a constant not depending on the parameter @xmath3 of the problem .",
    "we call such an algorithm _ fpt - algorithm _ or , more concretely , to visualize the choice of @xmath34 and @xmath22 , we say that @xmath56-fpt . we define the parameterized class fpt as the one containing all parameterized problems that can be solved by an fpt - algorithm .    observe that an apparently more demanding definition of an fpt - algoritm would ask for algorithms runnning in @xmath57 steps , since then the exponential part would be additive rather than multiplicative .",
    "however , this would not define a different parameterized complexity class . to see this , suppose that some parameterized problem @xmath58 can be solved by an algorithm @xmath59 that can decide whether some @xmath60 belongs in @xmath47 in @xmath61 steps . in case @xmath62 , the same algorithm requires @xmath63 steps , while if @xmath64 , the algorithm runs in less than @xmath65 steps . in both cases , @xmath59 solves @xmath47 in at most @xmath66 steps where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "time bounds for parameterized algorithms have two parts .",
    "the @xmath69 is called _",
    "parameter dependence _ and , is typically a super - polynomial function .",
    "the @xmath21 is a polynomial function and we will call it _ polynomial part_. while in classic algorithm design there is only polynomial part to improve , in fpt - algorithms it appears to be more important to improve the parameter dependence . clearly , for practical purposes , an @xmath57 step fpt - algorithm is more welcome than one running in @xmath70 steps .",
    "notice that a problem of classic complexity whose input has several integers has several parameterizations depending on which one is chosen to be the parameter .",
    "we complement the name of a parameterized problem so to indicate the parameterization that we choose .",
    "in many cases , the parameterization refers to a property of the input . as a driving example we consider the following problem : + dominating set + _ instance : _ a graph @xmath4 and an integer @xmath3 + _ question _ : does @xmath4 have a dominating set of size at most @xmath3 ?",
    "+ dominating set has several parameterizations .",
    "the most popular one is the following one : + @xmath3-dominating set + _ instance : _ a graph @xmath4 and an integer @xmath3 .",
    "+ _ parameter : _ @xmath3 .",

    "the truth selection component is a clique and the gap selection consists of @xmath14 cliques which we call _ columns_. our first action is to ensure that in _ any _ dominating set of @xmath39 elements , we must pick one vertex from each of these two components .",
    "this goal is achieved by the @xmath39 sets of @xmath151 enforcers ( which are independent sets ) .",
    "for example , for each truth selection clique , @xmath151 enforcers are connected to every vertex in this clique and nowhere else and then it will follow by the pigeonhole principle that in any size @xmath39 dominating set for the final graph , to dominate these enforcers , _ some vertex _ in the truth selection clique must be chosen .",

    "since there is only a single edge to the corresponding vertex in @xmath164 , there can not possibly be a size @xmath39 dominating set for such a choice .",

    "many polynomial kernels make strong use of results in extremal graph theory . an easy , though characteristic , example is the following problem : +   + _ instance : _   a connected graph @xmath530 and an integer @xmath600 .",

    "notice that @xmath128 does not have vertices of degree 1 and all its vertices of degree 2  we call them _ subdivision vertices _  are internal vertices of some chain of length 2 .",

    "we add edges between siblings so that @xmath128 is transformed to a graph @xmath908 with minimum degree 3 .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath908 contains a spanning tree with at least @xmath332 leaves then also @xmath128 contains a spanning tree with at least @xmath332 leaves . as @xmath909 ,",
    "then from the main result of kleitman and west in  @xcite we have that @xmath908 ( and therefore @xmath128 ) contains a spanning tree of with least @xmath332 leaves . by the construction of @xmath128",
    ", it easily follows that this spanning tree of @xmath128 can be extended to a spanning tree in @xmath813 with at least the same number of leaves and we are done .",
    "clearly , the correctness of the above kernel is based on the combinatorial result of @xcite . by using more reduction rules and more refined arguments it is possible to construct even better kernels for .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite estivill - castro , fellows , langston , and rosamond give a @xmath910 kernel for this problem .",
    "notice that the parameterized complexity of the problem changes drastically if we ask for a spanning tree with _ at most _",
    "@xmath3 leaves . even for @xmath911",
    ", this is an np - complete problem .",
    "therefore there is no @xmath912 algorithm for this parametrization , unless @xmath77 .",
    "clearly , one can not expect that a kernel exists for a problem that is hard for some level of the w - hierarchy .",
    "however , such problems may become fixed parameter tractable when their instances are restricted to sparse structures . in case of graph - theoretic problems such",
    "a sparsity criterion is usually planarity or the exclusion of certain types of graphs as a minor .",
    "the prototype of such a problem was planar dominating set that , as we mentioned in subsection  [ subexpalg ] , belongs to subfpt .",
    "the first kernel for this problem was given by the celebrated result of alber , fellows , and niedermeier in  @xcite and was of size @xmath913 .",
    "the kernel of  @xcite is using the fact that the sphere in which the input graph is embedded , can be decomposed into a set of @xmath914 regions such that each vertex inside a region is in the neighborhood of its boundary vertices .",
    "this last property , makes it possible to apply a suitable reduction in each region and reduce its vertices to a constant size .",
    "because of planarity , there are @xmath914 regions in total and this implies the existence of a linear kernel . based on the same idea and a more refined analysis ,",
    "this kernel was improved to one of size @xmath915 in  @xcite .",
    "the idea of a region decomposition was further extended in  @xcite for several problems such as connected vertex cover , minimum edge dominating set , maximum triangle packing , and efficient dominating set on planar graphs .",
    "while in all the above results the reduction rules were particular for each problem , it appeared that the whole idea can be vastly extended to a general meta - algorithmic framework that we will describe in the rest of this section .",
    "let @xmath916 be the family of all graphs that can be embedded in a surface @xmath49 of euler - genus at most @xmath917 . given a graph @xmath4 embedded in a surface @xmath49 of euler - genus @xmath917 , and a set @xmath117",
    ", we define @xmath918 to be the set of all vertices of @xmath4 whose radial distance from some vertex of @xmath117 is at most @xmath152 .",
    "the _ radial distance _ between two vertices @xmath919 is the minimum length of an alternating sequence of vertices and faces starting from @xmath345 and ending in @xmath920 , such that every two consecutive elements of this sequence are incident to each other .",
    "we consider parameterized problems where @xmath921 , i.e. we impose bounded genus as a promise condition .",
    "we say that a parameterized problem @xmath921 is _ _ compact _ _ if there exists an integer @xmath152 such that for all @xmath922 , there is an embedding of @xmath4 in a surface @xmath49 of euler - genus at most @xmath917 and a set @xmath923 such that @xmath924 and @xmath925 .",
    "the compactness condition is what makes it possible to construct a region decomposition for the instances of a parameterized problem .",
    "the region decomposition is constructed on the surface where the input graph is embedded . for the automation of the reduction rules that are applied in the regions we demand the expressibility of the problem by a certain logic .",
    "counting monadic second - order logic ( cmsol ) is an extension of msol defined in  subsection  [ ftpfol ] where , in addition to the usual features of monadic second - order logic , we have atomic formulas testing whether the cardinality of a set is equal to @xmath14 modulo @xmath312 , where @xmath14 and @xmath312 are integers such that @xmath926 and @xmath927 ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "<S> one approach to confronting computational hardness is to try to understand the contribution of various parameters to the running time of algorithms and the complexity of computational tasks . </S>",
    "<S> almost no computational tasks in real life are specified by their size alone . </S>",
    "<S> it is not hard to imagine that some parameters contribute more intractability than others and it seems reasonable to develop a theory of computational complexity which seeks to exploit this fact . </S>",
    "<S> such a theory should be able to address the needs of practicioners in algorithmics . </S>",
    "<S> the last twenty years have seen the development of such a theory . </S>",
    "<S> this theory has a large number of successes in terms of a rich collection of algorithmic techniques both practical and theoretical , and a fine - grained intractability theory . </S>",
    "<S> whilst the theory has been widely used in a number of areas of applications including computational biology , linguistics , vlsi design , learning theory and many others , knowledge of the area is highly varied . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that this article will show both the basic theory and point at the wide array of techniques available . </S>",
