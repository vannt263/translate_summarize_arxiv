    "neutron stars ( nss ) are prime examples of physical systems that require an understanding of both strongly interacting many - body nuclear physics and general relativity ( gr ) . with the density in their cores reaching a few times the normal nuclear density ,",
    "that is , the regime where theoretical calculations for dense nuclear matter are poorly constrained , the equation of state ( eos ) in the cores of nss is not well understood .",
    "different eos models would generally predict quite different physical quantities related to nss . from a nuclear physicist s point of view , it would thus be interesting to use the observed physical quantities of nss to place constraints on eos models .",
    "for example , the discovery of nss with masses of about @xmath0 @xcite would place a strong constraint on the underlying eos model ( see , e.g. , @xcite for discussions ) .",
    "a relativist , however , might be more interested in looking for eos - insensitive relationships connecting the different physical quantities , since one could then use these relations to test the underlying gravitational theory in the strong - field limit despite our ignorance of the supranuclear density eos .",
    "it is well established that different eos models would generally lead to quite different stellar structure and global quantities of nss , such as their masses and radii .",
    "it is thus quite surprising that approximately eos - insensitive relations concerning various different physical quantities , such as the moments of inertia , compactness , and oscillation modes of nonrotating nss , can indeed be found @xcite .",
    "more recently , the discovery of the so - called i - love - q relations in gr @xcite has gained a lot of interest .",
    "the i - love - q relations connect the moment of inertia , the spin - induced quadrupole moment , and the tidal deformability of nss with eos - insensitive relations .    since the original discovery by @xcite ,",
    "the investigation of the i - love - q relations has been extended to include rapid rotation .",
    "initially , @xcite used the rotation frequency to characterize rotation and found that the i - q universal relation is broken .",
    "however , more recent numerical works by @xcite and @xcite , which are supported by the analytical study of @xcite , found that the i - q relation remains approximately eos - independent for rapidly rotating stars when rotation is characterized by a suitable dimensionless parameter . besides the extension to rapid rotation , the effects of magnetic field @xcite and tidal deformation in ns - ns inspirals @xcite on the universal relations have also been studied .",
    "more recently , universal relations connecting higher multipole moments have also been investigated @xcite . as proposed in @xcite , one interesting astrophysical application of the i - love - q relations",
    "is to use them to break the degeneracy between the ns quadrupole moment and the ns s individual spins in the gravitational - wave analysis for an inspiraling ns binary .    from a relativist s point of view , as discussed above , the i - love - q relations are interesting because they are insensitive to eos models to within 1% , and hence they could in principle be used to test gr by comparing the relations with the relevant observed quantities .-",
    "mode oscillation frequency to the mass and moment of inertia of nss accurate to within 1% level have also been found @xcite .",
    "] furthermore , it would be interesting to study whether similar universal relations exist in alternative theories of gravity . in the original work of @xcite , besides discovering the i - love - q relations in gr , they also found similar universal relations in dynamical chern - simons gravity , although the relations differ from the gr ones .",
    "they further suggested that if the moment of inertia and the tidal deformability of the double - binary pulsar j0737 - 3039 can be measured to 10% and 60% accuracy , respectively , then the chern - simons theory can be constrained much better than current tests by six orders of magnitude .",
    "recently , the i - love - q relations were studied in eddington - inspired born - infeld gravity @xcite and scalar - tensor theories @xcite .",
    "it was found that the i - love - q relations in these theories agree with those in gr to within a few percent level .",
    "the universal i - love - q relations are totally unexpected and the reason why these relations exist is not yet understood . in the original work , @xcite suggested two possible reasons .",
    "the first reason is that the physical quantities considered depend mostly on the ns outer layer , where all eos models are similar .",
    "the second reason is that the relations approach the black hole limit as the ns compactness increases and hence the internal structure of ns becomes unimportant .",
    "more recently , @xcite suggested that the isodensity contours of realistic nss can be approximated by elliptical isodensity contours , and the assumption of the self - similarity of these surfaces plays a crucial role in the universality of i - love - q relations ( see section  [ sec : isodensity ] for a discussion ) .    in this paper , we propose that although realistic eos models can differ from one another quite significantly , they are nevertheless already stiff enough in the nuclear density range to lead to the universality of the i - love - q relations .",
    "the stiffness of an eos is measured by its effective adiabatic index @xmath1 . while it is well known that @xmath1 generally depends quite sensitively on the density and varies from one eos to another",
    ", the fact that modern realistic eos models are typically stiff enough and have @xmath2 above the nuclear density range is enough to explain the universality of the i - love - q relations .",
    "we will study analytically how the i - love relation in newtonian gravity depends on the stellar density profile , and hence the underlying eos model , which is parameterized by a perturbation parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we demonstrate that the prescribed density profile with the value @xmath4 can yield the ns structure constructed by realistic eos models very well .",
    "furthermore , we show that the perturbation expansion point @xmath5 , which corresponds to an incompressible stellar model ( with @xmath6 formally ) , is a stationary point for the i - love relation in the sense that the dependence of the relation on the stellar density profile is second order in @xmath3 , and hence is weakly dependent on the eos .",
    "our analysis suggests that , in view of the i - love relation , different realistic eos models are generally stiff enough to be modeled well by a single incompressible eos , and hence lead to an approximate universality .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : i - love - q ] , we show numerically that the i - love - q relations obtained from realistic eoss can be accurately represented by those of the incompressible eos .",
    "we then provide a newtonian analysis in section  [ sec : analy ] to show that why this is the case for the i - love relation . in section  [ sec : breakdown ]",
    ", we study when the universality of i - love - q relations would break down .",
    "section  [ sec : isodensity ] compares our finding with the recent work of @xcite in which the elliptical isodensity approximation is suggested to play a crucial role in the universality .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",

    "here , we will study the i - love - q relations numerically in the slow - rotation approximation . in gr , the moment of inertia @xmath8 of a star",

    "in particular , we will use the results of an incompressible model as a benchmark to compare with those of realistic eos models . to achieve the comparison , for a fixed @xmath28 we define the fractional difference @xmath29 where @xmath24 and @xmath30 are the scaled moments of inertia of a realistic eos model and the incompressible model , respectively .",

    "this may not be that surprising because it is well known that gravity in gr is stronger than that in newtonian theory , and hence gr tends to destabilize a star .",
    "this destabilizing effect can be interpreted as an effective softening of the underlying eos in such a way that the resulting density profile can not be modeled well by equation  ( [ eq : rho_profile ] ) .",

    "note , however , that the sensitivity on the eos can only be seen indirectly by subtracting the i - love - q relations by their incompressible limits . near the minimum - mass limit at about @xmath97 , the fractional differences @xmath98 and @xmath17 increase to about 20% and 7% , respectively .",
    "however , contrary to the case for nss , the i - love - q relations for low - mass qss can still be accurately represented by the incompressible limit . on physical grounds ,",
    "the large deviation of the i - love - q relations from the incompressible limit for low - mass nss is due to the fact that these stars have low densities and their interiors are on average dominated by relatively softer matter with a smaller @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , a low - mass ns with @xmath99 and @xmath100 constructed from the sly4 eos would have about 70% of its total mass attributed to matter with @xmath101 . on the other hand",
    ", qss can be modeled by the incompressible model very well regardless of their masses .",
    "the different behaviors of the i - love - q relations for low - mass nss and qss might point to a method that allows us , at least in principle , to distinguish between these two types of objects observationally .",
    "however , can low - mass compact stars be formed in the first place ?",
    "it is known that hot proto - nss formed in supernova explosions generally have a large minimum mass , hence rendering the existence of low - mass nss unlikely .",
    "nevertheless , it is still not ruled out that low - mass nss can be formed via fragmentation during the formation of proto - nss @xcite .",
    "this is still an open question for further investigation .",
    "approximate universal relations among multipole moments have also been found recently @xcite . in particular , @xcite found that the isodensity contours of realistic nss can be approximated by elliptical isodensity contours and that the relaxation of the self - similarity assumption of these surfaces can destroy the universal relations among multipole moments .",
    "they further suggested that the universal i - q relation between @xmath37 and @xmath36 would be affected by the elliptical isodensity approximation in roughly the same way . in this paper , based on our numerical evidence and newtonian perturbative analysis",
    ", we propose that the universality of i - love - q relations can be attributed to the incompressible limit of these relations .",
    "the physical reason is due to the fact that modern realistic eoss are stiff in the nuclear density range .",
    "is there any connection between our study and the elliptical isodensity approximation as discussed by @xcite ?",
    "a first hint can be seen in figure 17 of @xcite in which the variation of the eccentricity inside a slowly rotating newtonian star ( modeled by the polytropic eos ) is shown to decrease as the stiffness of the eos increases . in particular , the elliptical isodensity approximation becomes exact in the incompressible limit .",
    "@xcite also found that the eccentricity profile is almost constant for qss with large @xmath102 ( corresponding to small compactness ) , and hence the elliptical isodensity approximation becomes highly accurate ( see figure 15 of @xcite ) .",
    "we can understand this result by noting that the average effective adiabatic index of quark matter inside qss increases with decreasing compactness . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found that there are no universal relations among multipole moments and between @xmath24 and @xmath26 for noncompact stars .",
    "they also found that the variation of eccentricity inside noncompact stars is large and suggested that the loss of universality for these stars could be a consequence of the breakdown of the elliptical isodensity approximation . from our point of view",
    ", however , the loss of universality for noncompact stars is due to the fact that the underlying eos is much softer than the eos of nuclear matter .    generally speaking , for a given star",
    ", the validity of the elliptical isodensity approximation , which is a criterion for the i - love - q universality as suggested in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , needs to be verified by numerical methods on a case by case basis .",
    "however , from the above discussion , it is evident that the high stiffness of the eos can directly lead to the validity of the elliptical isodensity approximation .",
    "therefore , we believe that the stiffness of the eos plays a more fundamental role in the observed universality .",
    "the requirement that nuclear - matter eoss only need to be stiff is a physically appealing and simple explanation for the universality .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite further suggested that the validity of the elliptical isodensity approximation and hence the observed universality , are due to an approximate symmetry emerging in relativistic stars , which are composed of nuclear matter with high stiffness and which have large compactnesses .",
    "it is crucial to pinpoint the exact cause of the universality .",
    "does either high stiffness or large compactness in itself lead to the universality ? does the universality arise from the concerted effects of both high stiffness and large compactness ? as we have already seen in figures  [ fig : i - love - q_real ] and [ fig : i - love - q_poly ] of the present paper , the accuracy of the i - love - q relations slightly deteriorates towards the large compactness end and , as mentioned above , is better for high - stiffness eoss .",
    "similarly , as shown in figures 2 , 15 , and 16 of @xcite , the accuracy of the elliptical isodensity approximation also worsens with increasing stellar compactness .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the high stiffness of nuclear matter is the cause of the universality .",
    "the effect of gr in fact softens the stiffness of matter and adversely affects the universal relations .",
    "is plotted against @xmath103 for polytropic models.,width=283 ]    in this paper , we have provided numerical evidence showing that the universality of i - love - q relations can be attributed to the incompressible limits of these relations . for typical nss with compactness in the range from about 0.05 to 0.2 , the incompressible limit can model the i - love - q relations of realistic eoss to much better than 1% level .",
    "furthermore , using a generalized tolman vii model density profile , we have carried out a perturbative analysis of the i - love relation in newtonian gravity and have shown that the relation can be represented by the incompressible limit accurately and is weakly dependent on the eos because the incompressible limit is a stationary point .",
    "the leading dependence of the i - love relation on the density profile , and hence the underlying eos model , turns out to be second order in the expansion parameter @xmath3 that is used to mimic realistic nss ( when @xmath104 ) and qss ( when @xmath69 ) .",
    "we also demonstrate numerically that the i - love - q relations for low - mass nss , which are composed mainly of softer nuclear matter , deviate significantly from the incompressible limit and become more sensitive on the underlying eos . on the other hand , the i - love - q relations for low - mass qss",
    "can still be represented accurately by the incompressible limit because qss can be modeled well by the incompressible stellar model regardless of their masses .",
    "one of the possible reasons for the universality of i - love - q relations , as suggested in @xcite , is that these relations approach the black hole limit as the ns compactness increases . in this work ,",
    "we show that there exists a `` softer '' limit , the incompressible limit , to which the i - love - q relations for different realistic eoss converge , and hence a universality is established .",
    "besides the i - love - q relations , it is also known that the @xmath105-mode oscillation frequency and moment of inertia of compact stars also display a universality @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to study whether the two different sets of @xmath105-mode and i - love - q universal relations have a common origin or not .",
    "a first hint can be seen in figure  [ fig : fmode_i_poly ] , in which we plot the fractional difference for the real part of the @xmath105-mode oscillation frequency @xmath106 ( defined similarly as @xmath17 in equation  ( [ eq : delta_i ] ) ) against @xmath103 for three different polytropic eos models , where @xmath107 is the scaled frequency @xmath108 .",
    "we see that the trend of the results is essentially the same as those in figure  [ fig : i - love - q_poly ] for the i - love - q relations .",
    "the incompressible limit can generally model the @xmath105-mode universal relation to a percent level .",
    "this strongly suggests that the incompressible limit also plays an important role in the @xmath105-mode universal relations .",
    "we conjecture that in view of the @xmath105-mode and i - love - q relations , which is supported by our numerical evidence , their universalities originate from the fact that modern realistic eoss turn out to be stiff enough to be modeled well by the incompressible limit of these relations ."

    "<S> the recent discovery of the universal i - love - q relations connecting the moment of inertia , tidal deformability , and the spin - induced quadrupole moment of compact stars is intriguing and totally unexpected . in this paper , we provide numerical evidence showing that the universality can be attributed to the incompressible limit of the i - love - q relations . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that modern equations of state are stiff , with an effective adiabatic index larger than about two , above the nuclear density range is the key to establishing the universality for neutron stars and quark stars with typical compactness from about 0.1 to 0.3 . on the other hand , the i - love - q relations of low - mass neutron stars near the minimum mass limit depend more sensitively on the underlying equation of state because these stars are composed mainly of softer matter at low densities . </S>",
    "<S> however , the i - love - q relations for low - mass quark stars can still be represented accurately by the incompressible limit . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the i - love relation connecting the moment of inertia and tidal deformability analytically in newtonian gravity and show why the i - love - q relation is weakly dependent on the underlying equation of state and can be attributed to its incompressible limit . </S>"
