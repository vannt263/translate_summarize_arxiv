    "since the discovery of gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) in the late 1960 s @xcite , these energetic and mysterious phenomena have been targets of large observational efforts . the discovery of their afterglow in late 90 @xcite provided a great boost in grb studies at all wavelengths .",
    "the wealth of available information put severe constraints on the various families of interpretative scenarios , showing an unexpected richness and complexity of possible behaviours ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , a satisfactory interpretative framework of the gev emission is still lacking . in this context , ground - based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , such as magic , h.e.s.s . and veritas , despite the reduced duty cycle of ground - based facilities , provide access to the @xmath2100 gev to tev energy interval for grb observations .",
    "furthermore , the energy range down to @xmath3 gev , which was accessible almost exclusively with space - based instruments , has been opened to ground - based observations by the magic observatory @xcite .",
    "together with the multiwavelength coverage provided by the lat instrument , this makes possible the complete coverage of the 1 - 100 gev energy range with the advantage , in the vhe domain , of an increase of @xmath2 2 - 3 order of magnitude in the sensitivity relative to space - based instruments .",
    "moreover , the low energy trigger threshold of magic makes less relevant the effect of the source distance .",
    "the flux above @xmath2100 gev is attenuated by pair production with the lower energetic ( optical / ir ) photons of the diffuse extragalactic background light ( ebl ; * ? ? ?",

    "the resulting cosmic opacity to vhe @xmath4-rays heavily affects cherenkov observations , especially for grbs which are sources with an average redshift slightly larger than 2 @xcite .",

    "in addition , the transient and unpredictable nature of grbs makes it difficult for large ground - based instruments such as iacts to point them rapidly enough to catch the prompt emission and the early afterglow phases , when these sources are expected to be observable at high energies ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a discussion about iacts perspectives for grb observations ) .",

    "we used the publicly - available models for the galactic and isotropic diffuse emissions , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , that can be retrieved from the fermi science support center  .",
    "no significant excess was found in this observation , so we computed upper limits in 3 different energy bands : [ 0.1 - 1 gev ] , [ 1- 10 gev ] , and [ 10 - 100 gev ] .",
    "we first fit the broad energy range ( from 0.1 to 100 gev ) using the unbinned likelihood analysis , which was then used to constrain the background model .",

    "[ fig : ul ] .",
    "these uls are more constraining than the ones reported in @xcite .",
    "the reason for that is the usage of @xmath58 source instead of @xmath59 diffuse , and also the usage of a different procedure to parametrize the diffuse background in the three differential energy bins .",
    "even if observed with a considerable time delay , the achieved energy threshold of magic permits a better overlap with lat in the gev range when compared with previous results on grb by magic and other iacts .",
    "thus , it has been possible to derive simultaneous upper limits with a complete coverage of the energy range from 0.1 gev up to tev using magic and _ fermi_-lat .",
    "furthermore , it is worth stressing that , in the energy range where the two instruments overlap ( range [ 25 - 100 gev ] ) , the upper limits derived by magic are about one order of magnitude lower than those from _ fermi_-lat .",
    "in a commonly accepted scenario ( see e.g * ? ? ? * for a review ) , grb dynamics during the prompt phase are governed by relativistic collisions between shells of plasma emitted by a central engine ( internal shocks ) .",
    "similarly , the emission during the afterglow is thought to be connected to the shocks between these ejecta with the external medium ( external shocks ) .",
    "several non thermal mechanisms , indeed , have been suggested as possible sources of he and vhe - ray energy band ( 1 kev - 1 mev ) . to avoid confusion with the _ fermi_-lat and iact operational energy range ( @xmath020 mev and @xmath025 gev , respectively )",

    "the first one refers to emission frequency of the bulk of the electron population ( where most of the synchrotron emission occurs ) , while the cooling frequency identifies where electrons effectively cool .",
    "both are strongly dependent on the microphysical parameters used to describe the grb environment and , for a constant density @xmath62 of the circumburst diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) they are given by @xcite :    @xmath63 \\label{eq : num}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath64 \\label{eq : nuc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the energy equipartition parameter for electrons and magnetic field , @xmath67 is the energy per unit solid angle , @xmath68 is the observer s time in hours , @xmath69 is fraction of the electrons that enter in the acceleration loop and @xmath70 is the ratio between synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) cooling time , known as compton factor ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", we have explicitly assumed that the contribution of the compton scattering is not negligible in the afterglow at the considered time and , as a consequence , the cooling break is reduced by a factor ( 1+@xmath71 ) .",
    "it is important to remark that the change in slope of the optical decay observed in grb  090102 suggests that the standard model can not adequately describe the dynamics of this event .",
    "the steep - to - shallow behaviour could be interpreted as due to a termination shock , locating the end of the free - wind bubble generated by a massive progenitor at the position of the optical break .",
    "however , it is also possible to hypothesize that the early steeper decay is simply due to the superposition of the regular afterglow and a reverse shock present only at early times .",

    "any attempt to a meaningful modeling of the possible vhe emission component both during the prompt emission and the afterglow , must rely on information coming from the low energies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "at the same time , the modeling of the low - energy afterglow can furthermore help in limiting the intrinsic degeneracy or even , to some extent , arbitrariness in the choice of the various possible he and vhe afterglow parameters .",
    "following @xcite we assume that the cooling frequency at the time of magic observation is located between optical and x - ray band .",
    "thus , we can estimate the slope of the energy particles distributions which is correlated with the optical decay index . with the observed optical spectral index of @xmath76 @xcite",
    ", we obtain a value for @xmath77 from the relation @xmath78 of @xmath79 in good agreement with numerical simulations which suggest a value of @xmath77 ranging between 2.2 - 2.3 @xcite .",
    "we will assume that at the time of the magic observation , the outflow expands into a diffuse medium with a constant density of the order @xmath801 @xmath81 and we will further assume that all electrons are accelerated in the shocks ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "at the same time , from the available data , we can only constrain the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 . assuming that the optical light curve time break @xcite is less than the start time of the shallow decay phase ( t@xmath85s ) , we obtain @xmath86 and @xmath87 which only barely fix the @xmath83,@xmath65 values .",
    "we thus assume , within these limits , @xmath88 and @xmath89 which correspond to typical values for the late afterglow @xcite .",
    "the most plausible process producing vhe photons is the ic mechanism in the variant of synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) @xcite . within this process ,",
    "the low energy photons produced in the standard synchrotron emission are the seed photons that are pushed into the vhe band by ic scattering .",
    "similarly to the previous case , the predicted ssc spectrum is characterized by the two typical frequencies @xmath90 and @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the lorentz factor for the electrons of frequencies @xmath60 and @xmath61 . since electrons are ultrarelativistic ( @xmath94 ) , ssc radiation can easily reach the gev - tev domain .",

    "however , this cut - off is found to be above few tens of tev in our case , securing that magic upper limits stay below this limit .",
    "we also consider proton synchrotron emission as an hadronic - originated component @xcite .",
    "although protons are poor emitters with respect to the electrons due to their high mass , they can be accelerated in internal or external shocks in the same way as electrons producing synchrotron radiation .",
    "however , the peak flux for the two particle emission components is determined by the mass ratio @xmath99 which implies that hadronic component is usually much smaller with respect to the electron emission . nevertheless , while electrons cool quickly , protons cooling times are much longer since    @xmath100    where @xmath101 and @xmath102 , @xmath103 are the proton - gamma interaction and thomson cross section respectively .",
    "we note that since @xmath104 , @xmath105 and proton s energy is mostly lost in p-@xmath4 interaction rather than synchrotron emission .",

    "although only upper limits have been obtained , the possibility of having simultaneous observations with _ fermi_-lat in the energy range 0.1 - 100 gev and magic in the energy range that starts at 25 gev ( hence overlapping with lat ) make the grb090102 a good case study in spite of its relatively high redshift .",

    "it is evident that for the chosen parameters and at our observation time , leptonic components are the dominant mechanisms from the low to the very high energy . following eq.([eq : coolp ] ) , the cooling frequency for protons is usually located well above the very high energy range ( @xmath0tev ) and this make the process potentially interesting for magic observations .",

    "our estimates show that for this particular grb , magic follow - up observations made within the first 1 - 2 minutes from the trigger time would have the potential to detect the vhe component or at least to evaluate constraining upper limits ( see fig.[fig : prospect ] ) .",

    "<S> indications of a gev component in the emission from grbs are known since the egret observations during the 1990 s and they have been confirmed by the data of the _ fermi _ satellite . </S>",
    "<S> these results have , however , shown that our understanding of grb physics is still unsatisfactory . </S>",
    "<S> the new generation of cherenkov observatories and in particular the magic telescope , allow for the first time the possibility to extend the measurement of grbs from several tens up to hundreds of gev energy range . </S>",
    "<S> both leptonic and hadronic processes have been suggested to explain the possible gev / tev counterpart of grbs . </S>",
    "<S> observations with ground - based telescopes of very high energy photons ( e@xmath030 gev ) from these sources are going to play a key role in discriminating among the different proposed emission mechanisms , which are barely distinguishable at lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> magic telescope observations of the grb  090102 ( @xmath1 ) field and _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) data in the same time interval are analyzed to derive upper limits of the gev / tev emission . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these results to the expected emissions evaluated for different processes in the framework of a relativistic blastwave model for the afterglow . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneous upper limits with _ </S>",
    "<S> fermi _ and a cherenkov telescope have been derived for this grb observation . </S>",
    "<S> the results we obtained are compatible with the expected emission although the difficulties in predicting the he and vhe emission for the afterglow of this event makes it difficult to draw firmer conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , magic sensitivity in the energy range of overlap with space - based instruments ( above about 40 gev ) is about one order of magnitude better with respect to _ fermi_. </S>",
    "<S> this makes evident the constraining power of ground - based observations and shows that the magic telescope has reached the required performance to make possible grb multiwavelength studies in the very high energy range .    </S>",
