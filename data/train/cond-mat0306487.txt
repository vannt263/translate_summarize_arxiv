    "signal propagation in granular materials is a long - standing subject of interest  @xcite , and has recently attracted considerable attention in a number of novel contexts .",
    "one is the observation that the attenuation characteristics of signals ( impacts ) in such materials might make them good candidates for shock absorption  @xcite .",
    "another is the use of the backscattered signal for the nondestructive identification of buried objects  @xcite .",
    "interactions in granular materials are notoriously complex , but a number of relatively simple models have been implemented in the context of signal propagation , models that it is hoped capture the principal ingredients of the true interactions at least in some regimes .",
    "a model potential used for a monodisperse chain of particles that repel upon overlap according to the hertz law is given by  @xcite @xmath0 here @xmath1,\\ ] ] @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote young s modulus and poisson s ratio , @xmath5 denotes the initial equilibrium position of grain @xmath6 in the chain , and @xmath7 is the displacement of grain @xmath6 from this equilibrium position .",
    "the geometric parameter @xmath8 is the radius if the particles are elastic spheres .",
    "more generally , @xmath8 is determined by the principal radii of curvature of the surfaces at the point of contact  @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath9 is @xmath10 for spheres , it is @xmath11 for cylinders , and in general depends on geometry .",
    "two features of the potential are decisive for the resulting propagation properties of the chain : one is the exponent @xmath9 , and the other is the absence of an attractive portion in the potential .",
    "it is in this latter respect that the granular chain differs profoundly from the many models of nonlinearly interacting oscillators ( such as the fermi - pasta - ulam chain ) extensively studied in recent years  @xcite .",
    "two decades ago nesterenko  @xcite showed that under appropriate assumptions , among them the slow spatial variation of the displacements @xmath7 , the equations of motion for the granular particles could be approximated by a continuous nonlinear partial differential equation that admits a soliton solution for a propagating perturbation in the chain .",
    "more recently it was shown that strictly speaking these solutions are solitary waves rather than solitons  @xcite .",
    "it is also understood that a potential exponent @xmath12 is required to accommodate solitary waves , i.e. that a `` hard nonlinearity '' is required  @xcite .",
    "nesterenko coined the words `` sonic vacuum '' to stress the importance of the absence of `` harmonic terms '' ( @xmath13 ) in this analysis because such terms ( and only such terms ) are associated with ordinary sound propagation . indeed , as @xmath14 the width of the solitary wave diverges .",
    "more recently , numerical simulations of _ discrete _ chains have provided a great deal of additional information about the important role of discreteness as well as nonlinearity in the signal propagation properties .",
    "thus , while the continuum solitary wave solutions provide enormously helpful analytic insights , the importance of discreteness in the propagation properties of such chains should not be underestimated .",
    "neither should the fact that even with a `` harmonic '' exponent @xmath13 , the chain is decidedly different from a harmonic system _ because there is no attractive restoring force_. the resulting nonanalyticity of the potential leads to profoundly different properties than those observed in an ordinary harmonic chain .",
    "indeed , although solitary waves are no longer exact solutions ( and there is no longer a perfect sonic vacuum ) , there are extremely long lived quasi - solitary waves that broaden slowly ( whereas a harmonic chain would exhibit rapid dispersion of energy )  @xcite .",
    "we offer the above observations in support of the usefulness of a study of a chain with only repulsive forces even with the choice @xmath13 .",
    "a number of helpful insights can be achieved from such a study if one is able to obtain analytic results , and this is at all possible only with @xmath13 . in this paper",
    "we carry out such an analysis for the simplest ( and yet extremely interesting ) such system , namely , one consisting of only two masses .",
    "surprisingly , this simple scenario seems not to have been analyzed in detail in the literature , although the dynamics of pairwise collisions is an important input ( and phenomenological assumptions are made about it ) in the study of longer chains  @xcite .",
    "a two - mass system , being explicitly integrable , can yield valuable information . in view of some of the current applications of energy propagation in granular materials , we are particularly interested in _ backscattering _ and _ energy dissipation _ in the presence of friction , and on the effects of frictional disorder on these quantities .",
    "the results of our analysis promise to provide helpful phenomenological input into the propagation of excitation pulses in longer chains as long as the pulses remain narrow .",
    "for example , recent experiments on impulse dispersion in tapered chains indicate the significant role of friction in the propagation and dispersion process  @xcite .",
    "we find that a two - mass system leads to some unanticipated nonmonotonic ( albeit , in hindsight understandable ) behaviors as one varies system parameters . to support the relevance of our results to the spherical granular problem",
    ", we also present some numerical results for the hertz potential with @xmath15 and show the similarity in the behavior of this system and that of the @xmath13 case .",
    "we consider two finite - sized particles ( `` granules '' ) of equal mass @xmath16 .",
    "the specific value of the mass does not matter since it can be scaled out by redefining variables ; the only important point is that the masses are equal . when the granules `` do not touch '' , each moves independently of the other ( i.e. , their potential of interaction is zero beyond a certain distance between their centers ) .",
    "when they _ do _",
    "`` push one into the other '' , there is a repulsive linear force between their centers with force constant @xmath17 ; the force vanishes once the particles separate again .",
    "one or both of the granules are subject to friction , which may be kinetic ( i.e. constant , see sec .",
    "[ model1 ] ) or hydrodynamic ( i.e. proportional to velocity , see sec .",
    "[ model2 ] ) . in order to initiate energy transfer between the granules ,",
    "one can , for example , introduce some precompression in the system , or one can impart one of the granules an initial velocity toward the other .",
    "we do the latter : initially the granules are assumed to be just touching , the first granule has initial velocity @xmath18 toward the second , and the second is at rest .",
    "we are interested in the velocity of the two granules and the total energy in the system _ immediately after the collision_. note that in the absence of friction the collision is elastic so that the energy and momentum are conserved . in this case",
    "the first granule simply ends up at rest and the second with velocity @xmath18 , i.e. , there is no backscattering .",
    "of course there is backscattering , even in the absence of friction , in a longer chain .",
    "even these simple systems present a broad range of outcomes , some more interesting than others , and not all of which will be covered in detail . for example , one or the other or both granules may stop moving altogether before the collision is over .",
    "however , we are particularly interested in situations where the second granule is still moving forward after the collision ( propagation ) and the first granule is moving backward ( backscattering ) .",
    "our analysis will focus on these outcomes and the conditions that lead to them .    in sec .",
    "[ model1 ] we present and solve the two - particle model with kinetic friction .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "in this section we examine granule collision when one or both of the granules are subject to kinetic friction with friction coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "kinetic friction arises from contact forces when a solid body moves along a solid surface , and depends on the velocity only in that its direction is always opposed to the velocity .",
    "two cases are presented analytically ( at least in part ) .",
    "they turn out to exhibit rather different behaviors , which we anticipate here as a point of reference . in one ,",
    "only the second granule is subject to friction .",
    "we find that for a certain range of friction coefficient values there is both propagation and backscattering , that the velocities of the forward moving second granule and the backward moving first granule are monotonic functions of the friction , but that the total energy dissipation during the collision is nonmonotonic . in the second model",
    "only the first granule is subject to friction .",
    "here we again find a range of values of the friction coefficient for which there is both propagation and backscattering . now",
    ", however , the granule velocities are nonmonotonic functions of the friction while the energy loss is a monotonic function .",
    "results for the more general case of both granules subject to ( possibly different ) friction are presented numerically . in this way",
    "we cover the entire range of `` frictional disorder '' , as might occur if the granules are made of different materials . while most of our discussion revolves around the case @xmath13 ,",
    "some results for @xmath15 are presented . also , as a backdrop we keep in mind the most extreme case of a hard interaction , a hard sphere ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the interaction is instantanous in this case and leads to elastic collisions in which energy and momentum are conserved .",
    "the first granule stops and the second granule moves forward .",
    "this comment emphasizes the observation that only collisions of finite duration can lead to a combination of backscattering and propagation in two granules .",
    "we rescale variables ( see appendix  [ appendixa ] ) so that we can set the coefficient @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ hertz ] ) regardless of the value of @xmath9 .",
    "this rescaling allows presentation of results in terms of a single parameter , the scaled friction .",
    "consider first the case of a frictionless first granule .",

    "the velocities of the granules at the moment of separation @xmath40 are    @xmath41    the values of @xmath36 for which this description is valid are those for which @xmath42 , that is , for @xmath43 beyond time @xmath40 each granule continues on its course , the first forever and the second until friction brings it to rest .",
    "backscattering and propagation thus occur when @xmath44 as a function of @xmath36 in this range , the magnitude of the backward velocity increases monotonically while that of the forward velocity decreases monotonically .",
    "the backscattering is shown in fig .",

    "perhaps the most dramatic outcome of this calculation is the fact that _ the friction on the second granule causes the first granule to move backward _ ( recall that if both granules are frictionless the first one simply stops ) . in other words ,",
    "the friction on the second granule is responsible for backscattering .",
    "this behavior , strange at first glance , occurs because the first granule `` stops too soon '' , that is , it stops before the spring has had time to decompress completely .",
    "indeed , if the friction on the second granule is so strong that it does not move at all , the first will move backward with velocity @xmath47 .",
    "our model lies between the limiting cases of zero and very large @xmath36 ( @xmath48 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] we show the ratio of the total kinetic energy of the system at the end of the collision to the initial energy , @xmath49 in the rescaled variables , @xmath50 .",
    "curiously , there is a region where this ratio _ increases _ with increasing friction coefficient .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that when friction increases beyond a certain point ( beyond the minimum in the curve ) , relatively more energy is transfered to the first granule ( as opposed to being simply dissipated ) by the end of the collision .",
    "again we also show the numerical results obtained for the hertz potential with @xmath15 ( solid curve ) and comment on the similarity with the @xmath13 curve .",
    "next we consider the case of a frictionless second granule .",
