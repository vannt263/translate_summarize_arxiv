    "the total infrared ( ir ) luminosity , either alone or in combination with the ultraviolet ( uv ) luminosity @xcite , is increasingly being considered a reliable star formation ( sf ) indicator for normal , dusty star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is especially the case since the more traditional sf indicators , such as the uv continuum and nebular line flux , require somewhat substantial corrections for dust extinction @xcite .",
    "mid_-infrared luminosity has recently been suggested as a tracer of star formation @xcite , potentially serving as an alternative to the far ir , which is more difficult to obtain .",
    "the mid ir has received particular attention in intermediate and high redshift studies , largely driven by the sensitivity of _ spitzer _ mips observations , which with its 24 @xmath1 m  detector readily observes normal star forming galaxies ( @xmath6 ) out to @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and luminous and ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs , ulirgs ) out to @xmath8 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    the validity of using the ir as a sf indicator at intermediate redshifts depends critically on the assumption that the ir flux is tightly correlated with young stellar populations for _ typical _ field galaxies in deep surveys . while one expects dust - reprocessed emission from both young and old stars to contribute to the ir",
    ", the question of a dominant source is less straightforward .",
    "the source of the _ far - ir _ emission in nearby star forming galaxies has been a subject of debate predating the launch of _ spitzer space telescope_. that the majority of ir heating is due to young populations , i.e. , hot stars located in compact star forming regions , has been initially suggested by the similarity between h@xmath9 and far - ir structures within nearby galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "studies utilizing better resolution from _ spitzer _ to some degree confirmed these earlier findings and extended them down to 70 and 24 @xmath1 m  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the claims for a more significant role of older stellar populations in the far ir , which heat the dust through a diffuse interstellar radiation field , were initially based on the modeling of @xcite , who successfully predicted _ iras _ 60 and 100 @xmath1 m  fluxes using dust models and assuming that @xmath10-band light ( from intermediate age stars ; @xmath11 gyr ) traces the general interstellar radiation field . while it is now generally accepted ( e.g. , @xcite ) that the interstellar radiation field can be a significant heating source for the far ir",
    ", @xcite suggested that this may be true for the _ mid ir _ as well .",
    "they found that 6.75 and 15 @xmath1 m  emission measured by _ iso _ correlates better with far - ir luminosity than with either h@xmath9 or uv dust - corrected luminosity .",
    "more recently , the case for the interstellar radiation field producing the 8 @xmath1 m  pah emission has been made by @xcite who find a good correlation with 160 @xmath1 m  emission .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite find that 8 @xmath1 m  emission from hii regions in local lirgs follows pa@xmath9 emission from young stars when metallicity and age are fixed .",
    "however , unlike the emission at 8 @xmath1 m , the general consensus for mid - ir continuum at 24 @xmath1 m  is that it is dominated by emission from star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "the goal of this study is to explore the use of mid - ir luminosity ( specifically in 1018 @xmath1mrest - frame range ) as a sf indicator .",
    "this wavelength range falls inbetween the 8 @xmath1 m  irac and 24 @xmath1 m  mips bands , where there are no direct constrains from _ spitzer _ studies of nearby galaxies . also , our sample of 24 @xmath1m - detected galaxies at @xmath12 is generally more luminous than the samples studied locally ( such as sings ) .",
    "we base our approach on the comparison of the level of correlation between total ir luminosities ( extrapolated from mips 24 @xmath1 m  observations ) and uv / optical dust - corrected star formation rates ( sfrs ) .",
    "these sfrs come from uv / optical sed fitting , which allows us to construct sfrs averaged over various timescales , from 0.1 to several gyr .",
    "sfrs averaged over various timescales correspond to dust - corrected luminosities coming from stellar populations ranging in age .",
    "we perform the comparison for various subsamples , specifically for blue actively star - forming galaxies and red quiescent ones . finding the age of the stellar population that best correlates with ir luminosity could indicate the stellar population responsible for dust heating at 1018 @xmath1 m . in ",

    "we use a @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 cosmology .",
    "in this study we use various data sets matched to the deep2 redshift survey . redshifts and uv , optical , and @xmath16-band photometry are part of the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis , @xcite ) .",
    "aegis combines observations from a number of ground - based and space observatories .",
    "the deep2 sample is @xmath17-band selected , and we maintain this selection by keeping all objects even if they are not matched with certain bands . in most of the paper we study the subset of this optical sample that is detected at 24 @xmath1 m .",
    "therefore , one has a combination of @xmath17-band and 24 @xmath1mselections .",
    "24 @xmath1 m  data come primarily from the far infrared deep legacy ( fidel ) survey .",
    "main properties of the data sets are given in table [ tab : data ] .",
    "the core data set to which we match all other data is the deep2 redshift survey of the extended groth strip ( egs ) , one of the four fields of the full deep2 survey @xcite .",
    "deep2 egs spectra form the basis of the aegis survey .",
    "they were obtained with the deimos spectrograph on keck ii and cover a wavelength range 6400 - 9100 with 1.4   resolution .",
    "we use the 2007 version of the redshift catalog containing 16087 redshifts , of which 10743 are considered secure ( quality flag 3 or 4 ) , representing a 13% increase over the catalog described in @xcite .",
    "galaxies were optically selected to be brighter than @xmath18 , with a known selection function , resulting in a redshift distribution with a mean redshift of 0.7 and extending up to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "_ galex _",
    "@xcite imaged the central portion of the egs with a single @xmath20 diameter pointing ( figure [ fig : area ] ) .",
    "the exposure time was 237 ks in the near - uv ( nuv ) and 120 ks in the far - uv ( fuv ) band , which makes it the deepest _",
    "galex_single pointing to date .",
    "data are taken from public release gr3 .",
    "while _ galex",
    "_  observes in fuv and nuv simultaneously , 1/2 of the fuv exposure time was lost due to anomaly with the fuv detector @xcite .",
    "the _ galex _",
    "pipeline produces catalogs using sextractor @xcite aperture photometry . while adequate for more shallow , resolved images , such photometry suffers from severe blending and source confusion in the deep egs images ( _ galex _  resolution is @xmath21 , while astrometry is good to @xmath22 , @xcite ) . to remedy this problem we perform psf source extraction , which is less sensitive to blending @xcite .",
    "we use the custom - built psf extraction software _",
    "em photometry _ , developed by d.  aymeric , a.  llebaria and s.  arnouts , which uses the expectation - maximisation ( em ) algorithm of @xcite .",
    "_ em photometry _ extracts _ galex _  fluxes based on optical prior coordinates .",
    "while successfully dealing with blending , the resulting fluxes for a given set of objects will to some extent depend on the depth ( i.e. , the number of objects ) in the prior catalog , with photometric bias being especially pronounced for intrinsically fainter objects . in particular , having too many faint optical priors ( fainter than the equivalent _ galex _  limit in the absence of blending ) will result in the splitting of the uv flux of one object among multiple sources , most of which are not actually detectable in _ galex_images .",
    "we minimize this bias by using the list of optical priors based on @xmath23-band ( band closest to nuv ) photometry from the cfht legacy survey (  [ ssec : cfhtls ] ) and choosing a @xmath23 limit of 25.5 , at which the majority of optical objects still have real counterparts in the nuv image .",
    "after extracting the nuv fluxes using the @xmath23-band prior catalog , we find that genuine detections mostly have nuv@xmath24 , which we adopt as a cut for the nuv catalog , and which roughly corresponds to 3@xmath25 limit . as a cross - check",
    "we also perform source detection and psf extraction using _ daophot _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , without positional constraints on source detections . comparing the results from _ daophot",
    "_ and _ em photometry _ for relatively isolated sources , we find a good agreement for nuv@xmath26 , and a gradually increasing difference at fainter magnitudes , up to 0.21 mag at the catalog limit ( daophot photometry being brighter )",
    ". the difference can likely be attributed to unresolved detections in daophot , and it also represents the upper limit on the above - discussed bias introduced by forcing prior extractions . with an nuv catalog in hand , we repeat the procedure to obtain fuv photometry , now using nuv@xmath27 to set the cut on the prior catalog and adopting a fuv@xmath27 cut for the final fuv catalog ( roughly a 3@xmath25 limit ) .",
    "we estimate the bias at the faint end to be below 0.13 mag .",
    "the fuv and nuv catalogs are matched to the cfhtls catalog by construction , which is in turn matched to deep2 positions (  [ ssec : cfhtls ] ) .",
    "of cfhtls sources matched to the full deep2 redshift catalog , 22% have fluxes in fuv caalog and 59% in nuv catalog .",
    "rms calibration errors of 0.052 and 0.026 mag are adopted for fuv and nuv respectively @xcite .",
    "the egs represents one of the four deep fields targeted by the cfht legacy survey ( cfhtls ) .",
    "the central region of the egs is observed with the megaprime / megacam imager / detector in a single pointing covering a @xmath28 field of view ( figure [ fig : area ] ) in five optical bands ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the limiting magnitudes corresponding to 80% completeness are 27.2 , 27.5 , 27.2 , 27.0 , 26.0 , respectively .",

    "is performed using a @xmath31 search radius .",
    "astrometric zero points coincide to within @xmath32 , and the 1-d coordinate scatter between the two catalogs is @xmath33 , i.e. , both catalogs have very accurate astrometry",
    ". there are no multiple matching candidates .",
    "of 9923 deep2 objects ( from the full redshift catalog not restricted to good quality redshifts ) that lie within cfhtls coverage , 9056 ( 91% ) are matched .",
    "based on the scatter of the comparison of the bright end with sdss , we adopt rms calibration errors of ( 0.04,0.025,0.025,0.025,0.025,0.035 ) mag for ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "in addition to @xmath34-band data from cfhtls , we also use @xmath35-band photometry obtained with megacam @xcite on the mmt .",
    "these data extend across nearly the entire length of the egs , with 24 overlapping fields each covering @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37 limiting magnitude varies between 26.3 and 27.0 . matching to the deep2 redshift catalog was performed using a @xmath38 search radius after applying a @xmath39 offset in declination to bring the coordinate system of mmt data ( based on usno - b1 ) into agreement with the sdss system used in deep2 . the 1-d coordinate scatter between the two catalogs",
    "is @xmath40 .",
    "of 15283 deep2 objects ( from the full redshift catalog ) within mmt coverage , 10965 have a match ( 72% ) , with a handful of multiple match candidates , in which case the object with brighter @xmath35 is selected .",
    "since we have @xmath23-band photometry from cfhtls as well , we can compared them .",
    "the scatter between the mmt and cfhtls @xmath23-band magnitudes does not increase with deep2 matching separation , indicating that the matches are real throughout the search radius .",
    "however , there is a 0.08 mag overall offset between two magnitudes in the sense that cfhtls @xmath23 is fainter than mmt @xmath23 . at the bright end",
    "we can compare these magnitudes to sdss .",
    "mmt @xmath23 matches sdss very well , while cfhtls @xmath23 is again fainter , but by 0.05 mag ( both mmt and cfhtls photometry was first transformed to sdss system ) .",
    "the offsets between mmt and cfhtls @xmath23 do not show an obvious color dependence .",
    "we correct these offsets in the sed fitting .",
    "we adopt a calibration rms error of 0.04 mag for mmt photometry .      the reddest photometry band that we use in the sed",
    "fitting comes from the palomar @xmath16-band survey of deep2 @xcite . including redder bands ( such as irac 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m )",
    "would not place additional constraints on sfrs , which are the main focus of this paper .",
    "the egs is almost fully covered with thirty - five @xmath41 wirc frames , down to a 21.722.5 mag limit at 80% completeness .",
    "we use mag_auto fluxes from the @xcite sextractor catalog , and their @xmath42 matching to deep2 .",
    "of 16087 deep2 objects from the full redshift catalog , most of which are within @xmath16 survey coverage , 10398 ( 65% ) have a match .",
    "in addition to uv through near - ir data that are used for the sed fitting , we use 24 @xmath1 m  observations to estimate ir luminosities .",
    "the 24 @xmath1 m  data were obtained with mips on _ spitzer _ as part of the fidel survey .",
    "fidel observed egs and ecdf - s fields with mips at 24 and 70 @xmath1 m  to depths of 30 @xmath1jy and 3 mjy , respectively .",
    "these depths approach those of goods yet cover a larger area . in egs , these data are five times deeper than the previous data described in @xcite ( which are co - added to fidel data ) .",
    "we extract psf fluxes from 24 @xmath1 m  images using _ daophot _ ( mips has @xmath43 resolution at 24 @xmath1 m ; @xcite ) .",
    "we then match 24 @xmath1 m  sources having s / n@xmath44 ( corresponding to 10 - 16 @xmath1jy ) to the cfh12k photometry catalog @xcite using a @xmath45 matching circle .",
    "this search radius is appropriate for bright 24 @xmath1 m  sources , which have a 1-d astrometry precision of @xmath22 .",
    "however , fainter sources have poorer astrometry , so we subject sources that initially had no match ( 39% of total ) to a larger @xmath46 radius search , recovering some 60% of them . in cases of multiple optical candidates ( 4% of cases ) ,",
    "we pick the one that has the @xmath47-band to 24 @xmath1 m  flux ratio that is at least two times more likely than that of other candidates , where the probability is based on the flux ratio distribution of unique matches .",
    "this allows us to resolve 30% of multiple matches .",
    "we consider the remaining multiple matches to be a blend of more than one optical source and exclude them from the catalog of matched sources and from further analysis .",
    "altogether , an optical match is determined for 74% of 24 @xmath1 m  sources within the optical coverage .",
    "the unmatched 24 @xmath1 m  sources are either blends or are presumably fainter than the @xmath48 limit of cfh12k photometry catalog .",
    "similar detection rates ( for similar @xmath17 limits ) were found in cdf - s by @xcite and by @xcite , 70% and 60% , respectively . in the opposite direction , of deep2 objects from the full redshift catalog , 6581 ( 41% )",
    "are detected at 24 @xmath1 m . we decide to match 24 @xmath1 m  data directly to optical instead of using irac photometry @xcite as an intermediate step , because irac coverage of egs is not as extensive . as a test , for areas with irac coverage we run matching via irac and find that in 98% of cases we obtain the same optical match as with direct 24 @xmath1 m  to optical matching .",
    "in addition to redshifts , deep2 spectra provide emission line fluxes which we use to select narrow - line agns .",
    "derivation of fluxes is described in @xcite .",
    "we also use _ chandra _ x - ray detections from aegis - x dr2 to select x - ray agn .",
    "details of the x - ray data , catalog construction and matching to optical sources are given in @xcite .",
    "the sample used in sed fitting consists of deep2 galaxies with secure redshifts and spectra classified as galaxies . a small number of galaxies fitting an agn template ( broad - line agns , qsos ) are excluded since their continua will be affected by the light from the active nucleus , and therefore can not be fitted with our models . in terms of area , our sample lies in the overlap of cfhtls and _ galex _  regions ( dark gray region in figure [ fig : area ] ) , which contains 5878 deep2 galaxies .",
    "other data cover this region fully , so their footprints are not relevant . using a technique similar to that of @xcite we first estimate the area of the full deep2 egs ( light and dark gray region in figure [ fig : area ] ) .",
    "our sample contains 53% of the total number of sources in full area , from which we arrive at an estimate of 0.31 sq .",
    "deg .  for the overlap area ( dark gray region in figure [ fig : area ] .",
    "we remind the reader that detections are not required in all bands as long as the object comes from the overlap area , so our _ optical _ sample used in sed fitting remains only @xmath17-band selected .",
    "we estimate galaxy parameters such as the star formation rate , dust attenuation , stellar mass , age , rest - frame colors and magnitudes , using the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite .",
    "the methodology is basically identical to that used in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* s07 ) , and we refer the reader to that paper for details of stellar population and attenuation models .",
    "model libraries are built by considering a wide range of star formation histories ( exponentially declining continuous sf with random stochastic bursts superimposed ) , with a range of metallicities ( exact ranges are given in s07 ) .",
    "each model is dust - attenuated to some degree according to a two - component prescription of @xcite .",
    "this model assumes that young populations ( @xmath49 myr ) lie within dense birth clouds and experience total optical depth of @xmath50 .",
    "when these clouds disperse , the remaining attenuation is only due to the general ism , having optical depth of @xmath51 , where @xmath1 is typically @xmath52 . in both cases",
    "the extinction law of a single population is @xmath53 . in our models , we allow for a range of @xmath54 and @xmath1 values as described in s07 .",
    "a feature in the sed that has the greatest weight in constraining the dust attenuation is the uv slope , which is steeper ( the uv color is redder ) when dust attenuation is higher @xcite .",
    "however , there is a significant scatter between the uv slope and the dust attenuation due to the differences in the sf history @xcite , which in our model is constrained by the inclusion of optical data .",
    "finally , we include reddening due to the intergalactic medium , according to @xcite .",
    "sfrs and stellar masses are determined assuming a chabrier imf .",
    "the only difference in model libraries with respect to s07 is that we now construct them in @xmath55 range , at 0.1 intervals in @xmath56 , whereas in s07 libraries extended out to @xmath57 at 0.05 intervals .",
    "while library redshift resolution is finite , note that we use exact galaxy redshifts to scale mass and sfr from normalized model quantities to full absolute values .",
    "we test the effects of library redshift coarseness on the derivation of sfr and mass . on average , redshift and @xmath56 differ by 1/4 .",
    "we produced a test run where we increase this difference to 3/4 by assigning the next or the preceding library ( e.g. , galaxy at @xmath58 is fitted with @xmath59 models instead of @xmath60 ) .",
    "as expected , the average values of sfr and stellar mass do not change , but the average absolute difference is 0.13 dex for sfr and 0.09 dex for stellar mass . from this",
    "we can extrapolate that when redshift and @xmath56 differ by 1/4 this deviation will be 0.04 and 0.03 dex , respectively . in our analysis",
    "this will be reflected as the small addition to the random errors .",
    "finally , since only models with formation age shorter than the age of the universe at @xmath56 are allowed , the number of model galaxies decreases from @xmath61 at @xmath62 to @xmath63 at @xmath64 . even at the high - redshift end",
    "the number of models is sufficiently large not to introduce biases in the derived parameters @xcite .",
    "our sed fitting involves up to 9 flux points ( fuv , nuv , @xmath65 , ( @xmath66 , @xmath16 ) , their photometric errors , and the redshift .",
    "photometry for various bands has been derived in a heterogeneous manner , but it should reflect the total fluxes in most bands .",
    "this will have a negligible effect on the results .",
    "the sed fitting has one degree of freedom ( scaling between the observed and the model flux zero points ) .",
    "for each galaxy the observed flux points are compared to model flux points , and the goodness of the fit ( @xmath67 ) determines the probability weight for the given model , and thus of the associated model parameters in the final probability distribution function ( pdf ) of each parameter ( such as the sfr , stellar mass , etc . ) .",
    "we then use the average of the probability distribution as our nominal estimate of a galaxy parameter and consider the width of the probability distribution function as an estimate of parameter error and its confidence range . in cases where no detection is present in a given band , that band does not contribute to @xmath67 .",
    "the bayesian sed fitting performed here has many advantages with respect to more traditional maximum likelihood method .",
    "the parameter pdfs allow us to determine how well a given parameter can be determined taking into account not only the observational errors , but also the degeneracies among the models .",
    "for example , suppose that the dust attenuation and the metallicity were completely degenerate , i.e. , that various combinations of the two produce identical seds .",
    "while the maximum likelihood will pick one ( basically arbitrary ) sed and its parameters as the best fitting , the bayesian fitting will produce a wide flat pdf suggesting that many different values are equally probable . similarly , the lack of observational constraints will also be reflected in the increased width of pdfs of those parameters that rely on these observations .",
    "while all flux points contribute to all galaxy parameters , it is to be expected that the uv fluxes will be more critical in obtaining current sfrs and dust extinctions , while flux points red - ward of 4000  will contribute more to the determination of the stellar mass .",
    "also , we note that despite the fact that our input ( observed sed ) contains limited information content , one could in principle derive an unlimited number of galaxy parameters , since the pdf of each parameter will correctly marginalize over observational and model uncertainties .",
    "most of these parameters will , of course , not be independent , which one can again establish using ( multidimensional ) pdfs .",
    "reader is referred to s07 for further details about the sed fitting procedure .",
    "@xcite , who use very similar model libraries and the fitting technique , also provide extensive discussion on the method and its robustness ( their  2 ) . in  [ sec : lir ] we will discuss in more detail the errors in the sfr .    before performing the sed fitting , we first examined color - color diagrams where we plot observed colors in some redshift interval together with model colors corresponding to that redshift .",
    "we were prompted to perform these tests after learning that there could be a discrepancy between the observed and @xcite colors in the vvds sample , in the sense that models were underestimating the flux in the 3300 - 4000   range @xcite . by visually comparing the locus of observed and model colors for various combinations of colors and redshift bins , we were mostly able to confirm this effect .",
    "we find the level of discrepancy ( up to 0.2 mag ) to be similar for both blue and red galaxies , which makes it unlikely to be the result of contamination from [ oii]@xmath683727 emission line ( emission lines are not included in @xcite modeling ) but , rather caused by differences in the continuum .",
    "@xcite use an updated version of @xcite models ( which include new prescriptions for tp - agb stars ) and still encounter the discrepancy .",
    "however , both the original @xcite models used here and the updated version used by @xcite are based on same _ stellar libraries _ which have a transition from empirical stelib spectra to synthetic basel spectra at 3200  .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this work to try to understand the origin of this problem . since at a given redshift",
    "this discrepancy would affect only one of our flux points , we decide to exclude that flux point from the sed fitting , i.e. , we exclude @xmath69 at @xmath70 , @xmath71 at @xmath72 , @xmath30 at @xmath73 , and @xmath74 at @xmath75 .",
    "we require a minimum of three flux points for the sed fitting , though most galaxies have many more . in 336 cases",
    "this criterion is not met ( mostly because cfhtls magnitudes are not measured in spite of the fact that the object is listed ) , and we exclude these objects from further analysis . additionally , we eliminate 197 objects with poor sed fits ( i.e. , high @xmath67 ) whose galaxy parameters are unreliable . in s07",
    "we discuss galaxies with bad sed fits and conclude that they mostly result from bad data rather than the limited parameter space of the models .",
    "thus we arrive at the final _ optical _ sample of 5345 objects for which we obtain galaxy parameters from the sed fitting .",
    "two parameters derived from the uv / optical sed fitting will feature most prominently in this work : the `` current '' sfr ( i.e. , the sfr averaged over the last @xmath76 yr , the shortest timescale that can be reliably probed with stellar continuum ) and the `` age - averaged '' sfr ( i.e. , the sfr averaged over the dominant population age , which depends on a galaxy and typically ranges between 1 - 3 gyr ) . both will be discussed in more detail later . here",
    "we wish to assess the typical errors associated with these parameters .",
    "both sfrs are dust - corrected and their probability distribution functions will automatically reflect various sources of uncertainty . in the case of the current sfr",
    "the error will be dominated by the uncertainties in the dust correction , which we confirm by finding a strong correlation between sfr error and dust correction error . in figure",
    "[ fig : sfrerr ] ( upper panel ) we show the error in current sfr ( @xmath77 yr ) as a function of rest - frame @xmath78 color , which we will use to select actively star - forming ( blue ) and quiescent ( red ) galaxies .",
    "the error equals 1/4 of the 95% confidence range of a pdf , which in the case of a gaussian distribution would correspond to a standard deviation ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the majority of galaxies have errors below 0.2 dex ( 60% ) .",
    "as expected , the errors increase as one moves towards redder , less actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "some galaxies , regardless of color , have an error in excess of a factor of 3 ( 0.5 dex ) .",
    "we find that these galaxies are very faint in the uv , with rest - frame fuv magnitudes fainter than 24.5 .",
    "figure [ fig : sfrerr ] ( lower panel ) shows errors in age - averaged sfr . unlike the current sfr which is mostly constrained by rest - frame uv , the age - averaged sfr is determined by optical light of stars having ages 1 - 3 gyr .",
    "it is also typically less than 0.2 dex , but it is on average higher for blue galaxies where the optical light is fainter . unlike the current sfr , here the errors stay below 0.5 dex , owing to the lack of very faint optical sources ( the sample being @xmath17-band selected ) . while the stellar mass does nt figure prominently by itself in this work ,",
    "let us mention that the typical stellar mass errors are below 0.1 dex .",
    "galaxy sed models used in this work come from stellar population synthesis alone , without the inclusion of gas emission lines .",
    "this could potentially lead to systematic effects in the parameters derived from the sed fitting , since the emission lines could `` contaminate '' the broad - band fluxes used in the fitting . typically , the most luminous emission line in our sample is h@xmath9 , followed by [ oii]@xmath683727 .",
    "h@xmath9 becomes redshifted beyond the reddest optical band ( @xmath74 band ) at redshifts above 0.4 , so it does not affect most of the galaxies in our sample .",

    "out of 5345 objects in the optical sample , we have 24 @xmath1 m  detections for 2430 ( 45% ) . the 24 @xmath1 m  imaging covers 99.5% of the area of the optical sample , with exposure times varying across the field from @xmath80 to 19 ks ( average exposure is 10 ks ) .",

    "a similar result was recently obtained by @xcite .",
    "motivation for the above division into blue and red sequence galaxies comes from a marked bimodality in optical colors of local ( @xmath86 ) galaxies @xcite , where blue sequence galaxies have active star formation , while red have generally ceased forming stars .",
    "the introduction of uv - to - optical colors by _ galex _ led to a recognition of a region in between the blue and the red sequences that was not prominent in optical colors @xcite .",
    "galaxies that occupy this region , the green valley , acquire intermediate colors either because they have an intermediate sf history ( transitional galaxies ) , or because their colors have been reddened by dust and would otherwise be blue ( dusty starbursts ) @xcite .",

    "this is shown in figure [ fig : ssfr_nuvr ] , where the rest - frame color , dust - corrected sfr and the stellar mass come from our uv / optical sed fitting , and the sfr is what we call current , i.e. , averaged over @xmath76 yr .",
    "if dust reddening is moderate , there should be a correlation between the specific sfr ( basically a ratio of recent to past sf ) and the rest - frame uv - to - optical color @xcite .",
    "one can see that this is the case for the majority of galaxies , especially in blue and red regions . however , if a galaxy has _",
    "dusty _ star formation , it will have redder colors for a given specific sfr ( because the sfr is corrected for effects of dust , while color is not ) .",

    "the assumption is that for most galaxies in our sample the mid - ir flux is representative of the total ir luminosity , and that one can use the luminosity - dependent sed models to constrain it .",
    "this is certainly an oversimplification .",
    "the rest - frame wavelength range probed by our 24@xmath1 m  observations ( 1018@xmath1 m ) contains many pah lines whose relation to the mid - ir continuum and to the total ir luminosity may vary significantly compared to the fixed ratios assumed in the templates @xcite .",
    "also , translating mid - ir luminosities to total ones introduces potentially large uncertainties in the @xmath16 correction .",
    "however , the use of total vs. mid - ir continuum luminosities is not critical in this work , and , as we will show in  [ ssec : mono ] , the results do not change if we use monochromatic mid - ir luminosity instead .",
    "the use of total ir luminosity is motivated by the commonality with which this measure is interpreted as a star formation rate , especially in high - redshift studies . once we obtain the interpolated ir template , we calculate the total infrared luminosity according to the relation of @xcite ( directly integrating the sed produces very similar results , and sanders & mirabel definition is used as a convention ) .",
    "in addition to @xmath89 derived from @xcite templates , we additionally calculate @xmath89 based on luminosity - dependent templates of @xcite and recent templates of @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the two with respect to @xmath89 from @xcite is shown in figure [ fig : dlir_comp ] . for our sample the ir luminosities from @xcite and",
    "@xcite stay within 0.2 dex of one another ( average difference is -0.03 dex and the standard deviation of the ratio is 0.09 dex ) . at @xmath90",
    "the scatter in the ratio is very small ( 0.02 dex ) , and the difference is almost constantly around -0.06 dex ( @xcite estimate being higher ) .",
    "differences with respect to @xcite ir luminosities are much higher , especially for lirgs and ulirgs ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "@xcite estimates get increasingly discrepant as the luminosity increases ( up to an order of magnitude ) , to the extent that 16% of what are classified as lirgs according to @xcite become ulirgs with @xcite templates , while the number of ulirgs changes from 21 to 156 . using @xcite templates",
    "could possibly affect some of the results in our work , but also those of many other studies .",
    "on the other hand , the differences between the other two templates are smaller ( see also @xcite ) , and we adopt ir luminosities based on @xcite templates as our nominal values .",
    "all of these templates are based on local , star - forming galaxies , so they may not be entirely appropriate for high redshift galaxies such as those in our sample , or to more quiescent galaxies . in our analysis we will therefore use caution when interpreting the ir luminosities .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lir_z ] @xmath89 is shown as a function of redshift .",
    "two dashed lines show regions that define lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "lirgs start to dominate raw counts at @xmath92 and we remain sensitive to lirg luminosities out to the upper redshift limit .",
    "we are also sensitive to normal star forming galaxies ( @xmath93 ) to @xmath94 .",
    "the number of ulirgs is small even at the highest redshifts .",
    "this is similar to the luminosity distribution presented in @xcite for cdf - s .",
    "since we study only 24 @xmath1mdetections with available spectroscopic redshifts , we check if the redshift selection introduces any biases at the high - luminosity end of @xmath89 . for this purpose",
    "we consult a catalog of _ photometric _ redshifts based on cfhtls photometry @xcite , and match it to optical counterparts of 24 @xmath1 m  sources .",
    "we then compute @xmath89 based on photometric redshift .",
    "for @xmath95 the distribution of @xmath89 of the photometric redshift sample matches the shape of the distribution of @xmath89 in our spectroscopic redshift sample , implying no bias of the latter at high ir luminosities .",
    "we now have on one hand dust - corrected sfrs constrained from uv / optical sed fitting , and on the other hand infrared luminosities from 24 @xmath1 m  flux .",
    "we will often refer to dust - corrected uv / optical sfrs as sed sfrs , or just sfrs .",
    "we emphasize that sed fitting allows us to construct sfrs on various timescales , i.e. , sfr averaged over some time interval .",
    "they are chosen to be @xmath96 , @xmath76 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 yr ( averaging interval @xmath99 ends with the epoch of the observation , i.e. , it is not centered on it ) .",
    "in addition to these fixed timescales , we also determine sfr averaged over the age of the galaxy , which is calculated as the total stellar mass ( current mass plus the recycled mass as estimated in our models ) divided by the time since galaxy formation ( from models ) .",
    "because in our models the galaxy formation ages have a _ uniform _ distribution , i.e. , they are not restricted to some high - redshift galaxy formation epoch , the derived formation age will be largely driven by the age of the _ dominant population _ in terms of light production ( for example , blue galaxies will be assigned young `` formation '' ages regardless of their `` real '' age ) .",
    "we verify that there is a very tight correlation between the derived `` formation '' age and the light - weighted age .",
    "therefore , what is actually measured by age - averaged sfr is the average sfr over the age of the dominant population , which for blue - sequence galaxies in our sample varies between 0.1 and 3 gyr .",
    "errors in uv / optical sfrs were discussed in  [ sec : sed ] for the full optical sample and those conclusions are applicable here for the subset detected at 24 @xmath1 m .    since the ir luminosity is usually considered in the context of ( current ) star formation rate , we begin our analysis using the concept of star formation rate , but extending it to include sfrs averaged over longer time periods .",
    "the temporal aspect is not essential here .",
    "the timescales used in averaging the sfr simply correspond to the light emitted _ today _ by stellar populations of different _",
    "ages_. therefore , what constrains the sfrs averaged over progressively longer timescales is the rest - frame luminosity at increasingly redder wavelengths .",
    "we will return to this relation between sfr and luminosity later .",
    "the timescale corresponding to lifetime of stars producing the majority of non - ionizing uv radiation is @xmath100 yr @xcite . since young stars are typically assumed to dominate the dust heating at mid - ir (  [ sec : intro ] ) , we begin by comparing the infrared luminosity with sed sfr averaged over @xmath77 yr , which can be regarded a `` current '' sfr . in figure",
    "[ fig : lir_sfr_all ] we plot all 2430 galaxies from our optical sample detected at 24 @xmath1 m .",
    "the line represents the 1:1 correspondence between the sfr and the infrared luminosity assuming the kennicutt conversion ( converted to chabrier imf by applying a factor of 1.58 , s07 ) .",
    "it is important to recall that the kennicutt conversion applies to optically thick dusty starbursts with constant sf histories over @xmath101@xmath76 yr and solar metallicities .",
    "the conversion factor is not empirical , but is derived from population synthesis models . while it is not strictly appropriate to use this conversion for other types of galaxies ( less dusty or less active ) , such practice is often encountered",
    ". this can be somewhat justified because , as shown in modeling of @xcite , the fortuitous cancellation of smaller dust opacity and the increased ir cirrus causes the kennicutt conversion to also hold for less bursty ( more normal ) sf galaxies . in any case , conclusions in our work are independent of the validity of conversions of ir luminosity to sfr , and instead we deal with ir luminosities directly . in figure [ fig : lir_sfr_all ] one sees a good overall agreement between the ir luminosity and the uv / optical sfr .",
    "the points on average lie 0.02 dex from the 1:1 line .",
    "the standard deviation in the logarithm of @xmath89 to sfr ratio , i.e. , the scatter around the 1:1 line , is 0.49 dex ( a factor of three ) .",
    "it is the _ scatter _ that we will use as an indicator of the level of agreement between the ir luminosity and the sed - derived uv / optical sfr .",
    "there are a number of potential causes for the level of scatter seen in figure [ fig : lir_sfr_all ] .",
    "first , there are measurement errors . on average ,",
    "the error in `` current '' sfr is 0.19 dex .",
    "the average error in 24 @xmath1 m  flux measurement is 6% ( 0.02 dex ) , which is negligible in comparison .",
    "we expect some error from the extrapolation of the observed 24 @xmath1 m  ( rest frame 1018 @xmath1 m ) luminosity to total ir luminosity ( e.g , @xcite claim a factor of three error ) .",
    "as discussed , the two frequently used sets of ir sed templates already produce a scatter of 0.1 dex in their estimate of @xmath89 .",
    "another source of scatter could be from from the inclusion of all galaxies in our sample , including many red galaxies with older stellar populations and not much current star formation . in order to compare uv / optical sfr and @xmath89 with an assumption that ir arises from star formation",
    ", one needs to limit the sample to actively star forming galaxies .",
    "following discussion in  [ sec : lir ] it would be appropriate to base such selection on a dust - corrected quantity such as the specific sfr .",
    "however , it is more intuitive to use rest - frame color instead . taking blue galaxies ( @xmath82 ) will select most actively star - forming galaxies ( including a large number of dusty starbursts ) , while not allowing galaxies with more quiescent sf histories ( figure [ fig : ssfr_nuvr ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : lir_sfr_blue ] , we now compare @xmath89 and sed sfr of blue galaxies alone .",
    "the sfr averaging timescale is still @xmath76 yr .",
    "the scatter in @xmath89 to sfr ratio is 0.42 dex , or 16% smaller than in the full sample .",
    "the scatter was reduced by the removal of red galaxies .",
    "this reduction can not be attributed to slightly smaller sed sfr errors : 0.17 dex for blue galaxies vs.  0.19 dex for the full sample .    throughout the lirg range of luminosities the agreement between the ir luminosity and uv / optical sfrs",
    "is relatively good , albeit with large scatter .",
    "this implies that the lirgs in the redshift range studied here can not be optically thick at uv and optical wavelengths , thus allowing us to use the stellar continuum to deduce the sfr and other parameters , such as the stellar mass .",
    "this , of course , depends on our ability to obtain reliable rest - frame luminosities and dust attenuation estimates .",
    "one also sees that the slope between ir luminosity and uv / optical sfrs is steeper than the @xcite relation .",
    "this is fully expected .",
    "the kennicutt relation applies to galaxies in which a large fraction of stellar emission is absorbed by dust .",
    "this will be less the case for galaxies with smaller sfrs , which have smaller dust attenuations @xcite .",
    "next we explore how the overall scatter in @xmath89 to uv / optical sfr ratio changes if sfr is averaged over timescales other than @xmath102 , still restricting our focus to blue galaxies .",
    "we again emphasize that averaging sfr over shorter or longer time periods is a way to probe the connection of _ today s _ stars having different range of ages using the sfr concept , and does not imply that the past episodes of star formation directly affect the ir luminosity that we see today .",
    "we start from @xmath96 yr , which can be considered an `` instantaneous '' sfr , and find scatter to be 0.43 dex , slightly larger than for @xmath77 .",
    "note that uv / optical sed fitting does not constrain the sfr averaged over such short timescales very well , and the increase in scatter is simply the result of the poorer quality of the sfr measure over this timescale .",
    "but for the two longer timescales , @xmath103 yr and @xmath104 yr , the scatter _ decreases _ , to 0.39 and 0.37 dex , respectively .",
    "we obtain yet smaller scatter , 0.34 dex , when we consider sfr averaged over the age of the dominant population in the galaxy , shown in figure [ fig : lir_sfr_t ] .",
    "this represents a 20% reduction in @xmath89 vs.  sfr scatter compared to @xmath102 sf timescale .",
    "the values of scatter we give here are for the @xmath89 to sed sfr ratio , but very similar answers are obtained if we consider a scatter around the best linear fit .",
    "one may get an impression that most of the reduction in scatter as we go to longer sfr - averaging timescales is due to fewer outliers . to check this , in figure [ fig : lir_sfr_gauss ] we fit gaussian functions to residuals around the linear fits , and find that the width of the gaussian ( which is not dominated by outliers ) decreases similarly as the overall scatter , indicating that the decrease in scatter is not due to the decrease in the number of outliers .",
    "the most pressing concern with the above result is that the reduction in scatter when comparing @xmath89 to sfr over progressively longer timescales is an artifact of the sed fitting procedure , such that it simply reflects the precision with which we are able measure sfrs ( and dust corrections ) at different timescales ( or alternatively , wavelengths ) ?",
    "the average formal error in our sfr measurements is between 0.14 and 0.18 dex for sfrs averaged over timescales @xmath76 yr and longer .",
    "the small value of the error and its small variation for different timescales implies that the sfr uncertainties are not modulating the level of correlation with @xmath89 , i.e. , the change in scatter is not driven by errors in the _ measurement _ of the sfr . while the above is true on average , in ",
    "[ sec : sed ] we saw that in some cases the error in sfr averaged over @xmath76 yr can get relatively high . removing all galaxies with error larger than 0.2 dex leads to some reduction in scatter with respect to @xmath89 , but is still larger than the scatter between @xmath89 and age - averaged sfr .",
    "the same is true if we limit the sample only to objects where the error in sfr averaged over @xmath76 yr is smaller than the error of age - averaged sfr .    to further test",
    "if we are able to reliably measure the sfr on @xmath76 yr timescale , we run simulations described in appendix a. from those we conclude that if the ir luminosity were indeed the reflection of the current sf , then our uv / optical sfr averaged over @xmath76 yr _ would _ measure it with a _ smaller _ scatter than an uv / optical sfr averaged over any other longer timescale .    finally , we notice that the average offset with respect to kennicutt conversion is larger when age - averaged sfrs are plotted instead of the current ones in figure [ fig : lir_sfr_t ] .",
    "this should not be surprising since the kennicutt conversion was _ calibrated _ assuming current ( @xmath100 yr ) sfr , and in general the sfr averaged over longer time periods will be higher than the current one ( because most galaxies have declining star formation histories ) .",
    "additionally , the correlation is now steeper ( the slope from the bisector linear fit was 1.06 for @xmath77 and is now 1.20 ) . since in both cases",
    "one has the same @xmath89 , the change in slope has to be the result of a differential change in sfr between the two averaging timescales for galaxies with low and with high ir luminosities .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : lir_z ] , galaxies with @xmath105 are detected only at redshifts below 0.5 .",
    "galaxies that we see at this lower redshift will on average be older than the galaxies observed at higher redshift , when the universe was younger .",
    "for the same rate of sf decline , galaxies that had more time to evolve ( @xmath105 galaxies at @xmath106 ) will show greater change between the age - averaged sfr and the current sfr than the younger galaxies ( more luminous ) .",
    "this moves @xmath107 galaxies more to the right in figure [ fig : lir_sfr_t ] than the more luminous ones , producing a steeper slope .",
    "the source of the ir luminosity will generally not be the same in galaxies with different dominant stellar populations .",
    "therefore , we now explore the strength of the @xmath89 vs.  sfr correlation , not only as a function of timescale , but also for galaxies split into various color bins .",
    "we now use rest - frame @xmath108 color because it somewhat better discriminates the population age of star - forming galaxies than @xmath78 . in figure",
    "[ fig : lir_sfr_sct ] we plot the scatter of the logarithm of @xmath89 to sfr ratio as a function of timescale over which the sfr was averaged .",

    "we looked at the @xmath89/sfr scatter in bins of galaxy stellar mass ( @xmath87 ) , specific sfr ( sfr/@xmath87 ) and the age of the most recent burst .",
    "we find that ir best correlates with @xmath76 yr timescale only for @xmath111 galaxies .",

    "as explained previously , we begin our analysis using the concept of sfrs averaged over various timescales .",
    "however , this was simply a convenient way to probe _ today s _ stellar populations of different ages .",
    "given that the flux that is responsible for dust heating must be produced at the present time , a quantity that will be more fundamentally correlated to @xmath89 is some uv or optical luminosity . for every sfr - averaging timescale @xmath99",
    "there is a characteristic ( rest - frame ) wavelength at which the population with the age @xmath99 dominates . in figure",

    "the values of parameters of the fit depend slightly ( @xmath120 in slope ) on the exact color cut .",

    "the pah features at 11.3 and 12.7 @xmath1 m  would be sampled in @xmath125 and @xmath126 redshift bins , respectively , and there we see a slight increase in scatter compared to other redshift bins . in each panel",
    "we repeat the bisector linear fit obtained for the full sample ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : bis ] as a dashed line . from that one",
    "can see that the slope appears to get steeper at higher redshifts .",
    "rather than assuming that the intrinsic linear relation changes at different redshifts , it is possible that this is because the intrinsic relation is not linear .",
    "then , since at different redshifts one samples different ranges in luminosity , segments of a curve will appear as linear relations with different slopes . also , it is plausible that the conversion from rest - frame mid - ir flux to to @xmath89 has wavelength - dependent systematics .",
    "one may wonder if the improvement in the correlation between uv / optical luminosity and @xmath89 as we go to redder optical luminosities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lir_luvopt ] ) may in fact reflect a more fundamental correlation of @xmath89 with stellar mass . on the one hand",
    "this is not expected because dust heating should correlate with some form of present flux , whatever from younger or older stars ( or some mix of two ) , and not on mass that includes stars that can not contribute significantly to the ir . on the other hand , we know that for actively star forming galaxies the star formation rate and stellar mass are tightly correlated ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when we compare the @xmath89 of blue galaxies vs.  their current stellar mass , the scatter around the least square linear fit is 0.41 dex , and the correlation coefficient is 0.76 , which is weaker than what we found when comparing @xmath89 to either fuv or @xmath10-band luminosity ( corrected for dust ) , with correlation coefficients 0.80 and 0.86 , respectively .",
    "very similar results are obtained when we substitute the current stellar mass with the estimate of total stellar mass formed over the galaxy lifetime , i.e. , the mass that includes recycling . however ,",
    "this is not the full story .",
    "there is evidence that the sfr vs.  mass relation evolves with redshift @xcite ) , so for a given mass galaxies at different redshifts will have different @xmath89 . indeed ,",
    "if we split the sample in 0.2 wide redshift bins ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : lir_luvopt_z ] ) , the correlation between ir luminosity and the stellar mass improves , and is comparable to that between ir luminosity and the dust - corrected @xmath10-band luminosity in a given redshift bin ( fig.[fig : lir_luvopt_z ] ) . since the mass measurement in the sed fitting",
    "is constrained by very similar information that constrain the optical dust - corrected luminosity , this similarity between @xmath87 and @xmath127 should not be surprising or considered or fundamental , but instead reiterates the connection between the ir emission and the stars other than the very young ones .",
    "the analysis presented so far has focused on blue sequence galaxies , for which it was reasonable to assume that ir emission would be strongly related to active star formation .",
    "the picture becomes more complex as one moves away from the blue sequence into the green valley and the red sequence .",
    "while some galaxies in the green valley will simply be reddened actively star - forming galaxies , others will have such colors because they have little ongoing star formation ( corresponding to galaxies above and below the dashed line in figure [ fig : ssfr_nuvr ] ) .",
    "we should expect older stellar populations to contribute more to the ir emission in the latter group .",
    "this will be even more the case for red sequence galaxies , which have little or no current star formation . in figure",
    "[ fig : ssfr_nuvr ] we saw that there exist 24 @xmath1m - detected galaxies well into the red sequence ( as red as any galaxy in our optical sample ) .",
    "their low specific sfrs indicate that these galaxies are intrinsically very red and not just dust reddened . in figure",
    "[ fig : lir_sfr_red ] we compare ir luminosity and the sed - derived current sfr ( @xmath77 yr ) for red galaxies ( which includes the green valley and the red sequence ) .",
    "we distinguish between dusty starbursts ( galaxies above the dashed line in figure [ fig : ssfr_nuvr ] , plotted as squares ) and regular red galaxies ( dots ) .",
    "the two groups occupy distinct locations .",
    "dusty starbursts have high uv / optical sfrs : above 10 @xmath128 , and in some cases approaching 1000 @xmath128 .",
    "they lie close to the 1:1 @xcite conversion between @xmath89 and sfr .",
    "this is expected if @xmath89 in dusty starbursts is due to sf .",
    "actually , galaxies with the most intense sf have somewhat lower @xmath89 than the expected , ulirg levels . for such extreme cases it is possible that the sed fitting overpredicts the dust correction ( but we can not exclude that ir luminosities are perhaps underestimated ) .",
    "non - dusty red galaxies ( dots ) have lower sfrs and lie above the @xmath89sfr conversion .",
    "this means that @xmath89 is not powered by the current sf . at each uv / optical sfr",
    "there is a wide range of ir luminosities .",
    "this again speaks of a disconnect between @xmath89 and sfr .",
    "non - dusty red galaxies are the main subject of the analysis in this section . can we explain the presence of 24 @xmath1 m  emission and the derived @xmath89 luminosities in these galaxies only with stellar emission , which by necessity ( since there is little current sf ) will mostly come from intermediate and old stellar populations ?",
    "do we see evidence that some other dust heating mechanism , such as an agn , may be present in these galaxies ?",
    "in figure [ fig : lir_ssfr ] the ir luminosity for galaxies with different ( current ) specific sfrs is shown .",
    "since , unlike color , the specific sfr is corrected for dust , this plot enables us to place red dusty starbursts together with blue actively sf galaxies ( left , @xmath129 ) , and separate more quiescent , red galaxies ( right , @xmath130 ) for which we investigate the source of ir emission .",
    "we see that galaxies with lirg - like luminosities are present well beyond the region of actively star - forming galaxies , with some having specific sfrs as low as @xmath131 , which corresponds to rest - frame color of @xmath132 , the color of the bluest nearby elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "one can be concerned that the use of ir templates based on actively sf galaxies to derive @xmath89 for these more quiescent objects may not be appropriate .",
    "this is entirely possible .",
    "however , as in the previous analysis , we will assume that this ( commonly used ) procedure is correct and then draw consequences .",
    "at each specific sfr there is a wide range of @xmath89 , especially for active galaxies .",
    "this is mostly the consequence of a wide range of masses probed at each specific sfr .    in order to establish",
    "if the ir luminosities that we see in red galaxies can be produced by stars alone ( of any age ) we perform the following exercise .",
    "the uv / optical sed fitting allows us to estimate the total amount of stellar luminosity _",
    "absorbed _ by the dust @xcite . according to the dust model of @xcite , this energy ( _ dust luminosity _ ) , will come from birth clouds surrounding young stars ( @xmath49 myr old ) and from the ism heated by stars of intermediate and older age . in the case",
    "when there is no non - stellar source of ir emission , the @xmath89 should match , or at least not significantly exceed the @xmath133 estimate . estimating the amount of dust extinction in quiescent galaxies from the uv / optical sed fitting will be more uncertain than in actively star - forming galaxies , as suggested in figure [ fig : sfrerr ] .",
    "nonetheless , we expect that the dust luminosity derived from the sed fitting should on average be correct , which therefore allows us to check the energy budget . in figure",
    "[ fig : ldustlir_ssfr ] we present the ratio of the dust luminosity ( @xmath133 ) derived from the uv / optical sed fitting to the observed ir luminosity against the current specific sfr .",
    "objects to the right of @xmath134 line are red , quiescent ( or transitional ) galaxies",
    ". ratio of @xmath133 to @xmath89 of unity means that the energy that is estimates to be absorbed in the uv / optical part of the spectrum equals the energy re - emitted in the ir . to see what range of values are consistent with the ratio of 1 , we calculate average 68% confidence range of the ratio ( two thick lines ) from pdf errors of @xmath133 , with an _ ad hoc _ 0.3 dex error for @xmath89 added in quadrature .",
    "most of the actively sf galaxies fall in the region consistent with the ratio of unity except those with high specific sfrs .",
    "as already mentioned , for these objects sed sfr ( and therefore @xmath133 ) may be overestimated , or their @xmath89 underestimated .",
    "red quiescent galaxies have a larger scatter of @xmath135 ratios , which is not surprising given the higher uncertainties in estimating @xmath133 from the sed fitting for these galaxies ( the thick lines ) .",
    "again , most galaxies lie within the @xmath136 range around unity . from this",
    "we conclude that the dust heated by stellar populations is roughly sufficient to account for the observed ir luminosity even for relatively quiescent galaxies with lirg - like ir luminosities .",
    "consequently , we conclude that there can not be a large population of ( presumably obscured ) agns which would significantly raise @xmath89 and skew the ratio below unity ( we will next see that agn may be affecting @xmath89 , but only at a moderate level ) .",
    "given the low levels of current sf in transitional and quiescent galaxies , one must conclude that intermediate and older stellar populations produce the bulk of the ir emission ( see also figure [ fig : ldustyo ] ) .",
    "regardless of the arguments laid out above , one would still like to test directly whether the presence of agns has a significant effect on the mid - ir emission in our sample , especially among the more quiescent galaxies . obtaining a full census of agns in our sample",
    "is not straightforward .",
    "first , our uv / optical sfrs can be derived only for galaxies where an agn has no effect on the uv continuum , which is why we have already excluded several tens of broad - line agns ( type 1 agn ) , as identified from the spectra .",
    "to identify narrow - line agns ( type 2 agn ) using the bpt emission line classification ( bpt , @xcite ) requires spectra that cover rest frame range from 48006600  . for our spectra",
    "this is possible only in a very small redshift range ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "however , coupled with information on stellar mass , some fraction of galaxies lying in the agn parts of the bpt diagnostic diagram can be distinguished even in single - axis projections of the diagram , i.e. , using one line ratio . using similar criteria as @xcite , we select agn candidates at @xmath138 by requiring the flux ratio @xmath139/h\\alpha})>-0.2 $ ] and stellar mass @xmath140 , and at @xmath141 by selecting @xmath142/h\\beta})>0.7 $ ] together with @xmath143 .",
    "these criteria select a total of 35 type 2 agn candidates detected at 24 @xmath1 m , which we call `` optical agn '' .",
    "additionally , we use a catalog of _ chandra _ sources @xcite to identify 74 x - ray agn candidates detected at 24 @xmath1 m .",
    "the majority of x - ray sources in the egs are believed to be agns or have an agn component @xcite .",
    "we plot the ratio of @xmath133 to @xmath89 against the current specific sfr in figure [ fig : ldustlir_ssfr_agn ] coding points by agn type .",
    "first , we notice that optical agns ( open diamonds ) are almost exclusively transitional or quiescent objects .",
    "this agrees with the results of local studies where there appears to be a relation between optical agn and sf quenching @xcite .",
    "x - ray agns are additionally present among the galaxies with higher specific sfrs , but only up to @xmath144 , which again may be related to their role in sf quenching .",
    "most agns have @xmath135 consistent with unity ( the @xmath136 range , shaded , is repeated from figure [ fig : ldustlir_ssfr ] ) .",
    "if agn contributes significantly to @xmath89 this would be reflected in @xmath135 below that of non - agn galaxies .",
    "while this is generally not the case , there is a group of agn at @xmath145 where in _ individual cases _ the agn contribution to @xmath89 may be around 90% .",
    "next we try to estimate the fraction of @xmath89 that is _ on average _ attributable to agns .",
    "figure [ fig : lir_ssfr_avecomp ] displays average ir luminosities in bins of current specific sfr for three classes of galaxies : 1 ) non - agns ( shaded region between two thick lines ) , 2 ) x - ray agns ( star symbols ) and 3 ) optical agns ( open diamonds ) .",
    "error bars give the error of the mean in each bin . on the actively sf side we have only x - ray agns , and",
    "their average @xmath89 is consistent with those of non - agns . on the quiescent side x - ray agn",
    "have @xmath89 up to 0.2 dex higher than non - agns , although it is only at @xmath146 that the excess is somewhat significant .",
    "optical agns are similar to x - ray agns at transitional specific sfrs , and then significantly lower than non - agns for low specific sfrs , most probably because these are low - power agns such as liners .",
    "the above procedure has a drawback that if agn selection is biased with respect to @xmath89 , their average @xmath89 will be off .",
    "thus we append it with the following test . for each group of agns ( optical and x - ray )",
    "we select a control group of non - agns with similar properties .",
    "this needs to be done for _ all _ agn ( 47 optical and 86 x - ray ) regardless of whether they have been detected at 24 @xmath1 m .",
    "for each optical agn we select an object from the same redshift range ( @xmath138 or @xmath141 ) such that the emission lines do not indicate an agn , and with a matching stellar mass and specific sfr .",
    "the matching object is defined as the one that minimizes the `` distance '' @xmath147 in the stellar mass  specific sfr space :    @xmath148    where @xmath149 is a `` scaling '' ratio between @xmath150 and @xmath151 , which we nominally take to be 3 based on the range of these quantities in our sample of agn .",
    "similarity in stellar mass and current specific sfr will ensure similarity in many other non - agn characteristics as well @xcite . for x - ray agns we select matching non - agns",
    "such that they are not detected in x - ray , have a redshift within 0.2 , and minimize equation [ eqn : distance ] . for both samples the same non - agn match",
    "is allowed to appear more than once .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bptagn_lir ] we compare the distribution of ir luminosities for optical agns ( thick histogram ) vs.  non - agns ( thin histogram ) .",
    "objects not detected at 24 @xmath1 m  are plotted with @xmath152 .",
    "the two distributions are quite similar , including the similar number of 24 @xmath1 m  non - detections .",
    "the average @xmath89 of the agn is 0.16 dex higher than that of the non - agns ( for the part of the sample where agn and non - agn are both detected at 24 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "however , the average stellar mass of the agn sample is also slightly higher ( 0.24 dex ) , making the difference in @xmath89 less significant .",
    "results are similar when we choose @xmath153 or 4 in equation [ eqn : distance ] .",
    "from this we conclude that optical agns are drawn from the same underlying ir population as non - agns .",
    "a similar comparison is shown for x - ray agns in figure [ fig : xrayagn_lir ] . if both an agn and a matching non - agn are detected in 24 @xmath1 m , their @xmath89 ( and stellar mass ) are on average quite similar , as was the case with optical agns . however , while 12 x - ray agn are not detected in 24 @xmath1 m , this number jumps to 24 for the non - agn control group .",
    "if we assume that each non - detection has @xmath89 corresponding to the detection limit at the given redshift , we get that the average @xmath89 of x - ray agns is 0.23 dex higher than of non - agns ( both agns and non - agns have the same stellar masses ) .",
    "this result is robust if we choose @xmath153 or 4 in equation [ eqn : distance ] .",
    "while our sample of agn is not large enough to draw firm conclusions , it appears that agn are not a significant contributor to mid - ir luminosities in the general case , i.e. , in samples that have an optical selection , such as ours . where their presence could be detected , especially among the transitional and quiescent galaxies , they still contribute at most 50% of @xmath89 .",
    "the contribution of agn @xmath89 from these galaxies to the global sfr density is beyond the scope of this work , but is most likely not very high .",
    "analysis presented in  [ sec : lir_sfr ] indicates that the ir luminosity extrapolated from mid - ir flux is better correlated with the optical light of intermediate age populations than with the uv light of young stars .",
    "this result can be interpreted as the larger contribution of intermediate - age stars than of young stars in the mid - ir dust heating .",
    "such interpretation is at odds with recent studies on nearby galaxies that find very good correlation between nebular emission line pa@xmath9 , that comes from massive young stars ( @xmath49 myr old ) , and the rest - frame 24@xmath1 m  luminosity @xcite .",
    "note , however , that we explore a different part of the mid - ir wavelength range ( 1018 @xmath1 m ) which is more affected by pah emission , and could therefore be more strongly correlated with the cold , diffuse dust from older stellar populations . what fraction of total @xmath89 ( irrespective of ir wavelength range ) is expected to come from young stars in this particular sample ?",
    "the dust model that we use in our sed fitting @xcite allows us to estimate the relative contribution of the stellar energy absorbed by the stellar birth clouds ( emitted by young stars ) and the ambient ism ( emitted by intermediate age and old stars ) .",
    "this is achieved simply by considering the uv / optical luminosity that is absorbed in these two components . in figure",
    "[ fig : ldustyo ] we plot the fraction of dust luminosity contributed by the ism , i.e. , away from the sites of current star formation .",
    "not surprisingly , this fraction correlates well with nuv@xmath154 color , which to first order gives the ratio of the recent to past star formation . for blue , star - forming galaxies ( @xmath82 )",
    "the fraction of dust heating , and therefore the @xmath89 due to ism can be as high as 60% and is typically 40% . while still not dominant , the ratio of dust heating due to ism can thus be quite significant .",
    "note that the ratio presented here does not constitute a measurement , but is set by the dust model we use here .",
    "however , this dust model is physically motivated and can therefore serve as a guide . in reality , the contribution of the ism may be somewhat different . generally , there are many uncertainties with respect to the evolution of the intermediate age population and their dust production to leave room for their greater contribution to dust luminosity , perhaps even at mid - ir wavelengths .      the presence of high ir luminosities in galaxies that appear quiescent ( not actively star - forming ) based on uv / optical seds seems puzzling . since for a given current sfr",
    "we have such a wide range of ir luminosities ( including a large number of optically luminous , yet 24 @xmath1m - undetected galaxies [ fig .",
    "[ fig : nuvr_hist ] ] ) , the disconnect between the star formation and the ir properties appears strong .",
    "we have shown that agns , while contributing , do not dominate in the mid - ir , and that the absorbed stellar emission ( from intermediate age and older stars ) can on average reproduce high ir luminosities . yet",
    ", this requires attenuations that are significantly higher than what we see in nearby galaxies with similarly low levels of specific star formation .",
    "locally , such galaxies are morphologically early - type galaxies , with low to moderate amounts of dust and with infrared luminosities that do not exceed @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "cursory examination of optical _ hst _ acs images of galaxies in our sample with @xmath156 and @xmath157 ( corresponding to uv / optical colors of nearby ellipticals , @xcite ) indicates that 2/3 of them indeed look like early - type galaxies , and the rest are either edge - on disks , or show some structure .",
    "these results indicate that a fraction of early - type galaxies at higher redshifts have significantly higher dust contents , leading to higher ir luminosities .",
    "the presence of large amounts of dust even in nearby ellipticals is an open question @xcite , and is outside of the scope of this work .",
    "another explanation for apparent high ir luminosities is that because we use ir templates based on star - forming galaxies to estimate the total @xmath89 of more quiescent galaxies , that this leads to significant overestimates .",
    "this explanation is not intuitive since one expects quiescent galaxies to have colder dust and therefore the mid - ir flux point used in conjunction with star - forming templates to underestimate the total @xmath89 . but this explanation could be valid if quiescent galaxies contained significant contribution of stellar components that peak in the mid - ir ( and are not included in ir templates ) , such as the dust around the agb stars @xcite .",
    "recently there have been efforts to explore the use of _ monochromatic _ mid - ir luminosity as a tracer of star formation , either as a substitute for the total ir luminosity or as a measure that is intrinsically better correlated with sfr @xcite .",
    "therefore , for our observations at 24 @xmath1 m , we construct a luminosity estimate at 12 @xmath1 m  ( @xmath158 ) , which corresponds to rest - frame of our observations at @xmath159 . to get @xmath158 for galaxies at other redshifts , we again rely on ir",
    "templates @xcite , but now to obtain only a relatively small k - correction , instead of a full bolometric correction . comparing @xmath158 to fuv and @xmath10-band",
    "dust - corrected luminosities we find that the linear fits have scatters of 0.34 and 0.28 dex , respectively , i.e. , they are some @xmath160 smaller than in relations with @xmath89 . however , this comparison can be misleading since the _ range _ of @xmath158 values is different ( smaller ) than of @xmath89 .",
    "if instead we compare pearson correlation coefficients , we find that they are basically the same for @xmath158 and for @xmath89 . while this does not mean that the total luminosity is intrinsically better correlated with the uv / optical sfr than the 12 @xmath1 m  luminosity , it does at least argue that at our level of precision the correction to total luminosity neither does introduce significant additional uncertainty , nor does it offer any measurable benefits .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",

    "they get dust - corrected uv sfr by applying a correction based on the fixed relation between the uv slope and uv attenuation .",
    "we will construct the irx measure in exactly the same way , except that our @xmath89 is extrapolated from 1018 @xmath1 m  rest - frame flux .",

    "many of the results presented in this work depend on uv / optical star formation rates that we derive using the bayesian sed fitting . in this section",
    "we evaluate the robustness of our sed fitting technique with respect to sfrs .",
    "we achieve this through simulations in which we try to recover a _ known _ sfr . in order to make the simulation as appropriate for our sample as possible",
    ", we proceed in the following manner .",
    "our sed fitting using real data tells us which model in our library best fits a given real galaxy .",
    "so in simulation , we simply substitute the observed fluxes with corresponding _ model _",
    "fluxes , but using the _ observed _ flux errors and the redshift .",
    "model fluxes are scaled to match the observed ones in @xmath30 band .",
    "then , the simulated sed fitting proceeds as it would for a real galaxy except that we exclude from the library the model whose fluxes we are trying to fit . in this way one gets an exact representation of the sed fitting for our sample but with the advantage that the _ true _ sfr ( and any other parameter ) that one tries to recover is actually known .",
    "first , we look at how well can the _ current _ sfr be recovered . by current , in this study we mean the star formation rate averaged over @xmath77 yr , the shortest timescale corresponding to non - ionizing uv emission . in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr_sim ] _ left _ we show the comparison of the current sfr retrieved from sed fitting and the true sfr over the same timescale ( @xmath77 yr ) .",
    "the objects shown correspond to the sample of blue galaxies detected at 24 @xmath1 m  ( i.e. , the sample studied in most of  [ sec : lir_sfr ] ) .",
    "we recover the sfrs reasonably well . on average , the sed sfrs fall 0.04 dex below the true ones .",
    "the level of discrepancy depends on the sfr itself . for sfr between 1 and 10 @xmath178",
    "there is on average no discrepancy , while for sfr between 10 and 100 @xmath179 sfrs from sed fitting are 0.13 dex lower than true ones",
    ". it should not be surprising that systematics at this level are present .",
    "the cause is most likely the limitations in the ability to obtain the full dynamic range of dust attenuations as discussed in s07 . in any case , the main results in this work rely not on absolute rates of sf , but on their scatter vs.  @xmath89 . the scatter between sed sfrs averaged over @xmath76 yr and",
    "the true current sfrs is only 0.23 dex .",
    "this is very close to what is expected from our estimates of the _ individual _ errors of sed sfrs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfrerr ] ) .",
    "next we investigate if the derived sed sfr averaged over a timescale _ longer _ than @xmath76 yr can correlate _",
    "better _ with the current sfr than the sed sfr averaged over @xmath76 yr itself",
    ". this could possibly be the case if our sed sfrs over @xmath76 yr are simply more noisy than sfrs averaged over longer timescales .",
    "one can imagine that this could result from the stochastic nature of sf histories in our models , where bursts have a timescale of roughly @xmath76 yr . in figure [ fig : sfr_sim ] _ right _ we show how sed sfr averaged over the population age ( 13 gyr ) compares to the true current sfr .",
    "the scatter , 0.39 dex , is considerably worse than in the case where we averaged sed sfr over the short timescale .",
    "indeed , by checking sed sfrs averaged over other timescales as well ( 1 and 2 gyr ) , we find that the current rate of sf is indeed best recovered with the @xmath76-yr timescale .",
    "additionally , we also find ( but do not show in a plot ) that the true sfr averaged over the population age itself is very well recovered in sed fitting , with a negligible systematic offset and a scatter of only 0.20 dex .",
    "to construct the dust - corrected sfrs and uv / optical luminosities we apply the attenuation model of @xcite directly to stellar population models and then compare the reddened models with the observed seds to derive sfrs and other parameters .",
    "thus we use the full uv / optical sed to constrain the dust attenuation .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to an implicit use of the correlation between the uv slope ( i.e. , uv color ) and the fuv attenuation @xcite , but is not identical to it since the @xcite model ( and implicitly our sed fitting ) accounts for the effects of the galaxy sf history on the uv color @xcite .",
    "however , in many instances it is more practical to perform the dust correction explicitly without considering the effects of sf history . in those cases",
    "one is using some _ fixed _ correlation between the uv slope and the fuv attenuation .",
    "for our sample of blue - sequence ( @xmath82 ) galaxies we find that the best fixed - slope relation can be fit with      where @xmath181 is the rest - frame uv color .",
    "this relation is somewhat steeper than the equivalent relation for local ( @xmath182 ) sdss galaxies @xcite , but still not as steep as the @xcite relation for local starbursts .",
    "while we use the exact same stellar population and dust models as in s07 and the fit is constructed in the same way ( linear fit through running medians ) , the current color cut is somewhat bluer , and more importantly , the two samples are different , with local galaxies being more quiescent on average .    here",
    "we would like to draw attention to a systematic effect that , to our knowledge , has not been discussed elsewhere .",
    "namely , while one normally expects the unattenuated fuv flux to best correlate with the sf on timescales of @xmath76 yr , using the fixed - slope relation to correct the uv flux ( i.e. , using the same relation between the uv spectral slope ( or color ) and the attenuation for _ all _ star forming galaxies , irrespective of their sf history ) will effectively produce a measure of sf that is _ on average _ somewhat better correlated with the sf averaged over @xmath97 yr than , as expected , over @xmath76 yr . for our sample of blue galaxies , we find the scatter around the linear least - square fit between sfrs ( from sed fitting ) averaged over @xmath97 yr and the _ fixed - slope _ dust - corrected fuv luminosity to be 0.15 dex , compared to 0.17 dex for sfr ( from sed fitting ) averaged over @xmath76 yr . on the other hand , as expected , the correlation of fuv luminosity corrected with _ full _ sed fitting dust - corrected fuv is the best ( 0.11 dex ) for sfrs averaged over @xmath76 yr , and significantly worse ( 0.19 dex ) for @xmath97 yr .",
    "the likely explanation for this counter - intuitive effect is that using a fixed slope between the attenuation and the uv color has the effect of overestimating the attenuation for galaxies that in reality lie below that fixed slope , and underestimating it for those that lie above it .",
    "since galaxies below the fixed slope are more likely to be galaxies with declining sf , while those above it tend to be more bursty ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the sfrs of the former get boosted ( and thus become closer to an average over a longer period ) , while sfrs of the latter are suppressed , again mimicking the average that includes the pre - burst period . because using the fixed slope effectively lengthens the sf timescale for galaxies with rising or falling sf histories , it has a consequence ( given what we have shown in  [ sec : lir ] ) that it will correlate better with the ir luminosity than the fuv luminosity that was corrected using the full sed modeling .",
    "in other words , using a fixed slope to correct fuv dilutes our ability to constrain sf over various timescales and study its relation to the ir .",
