    "oh maser emission is an important probe of obscured star@xmath0forming regions .",
    "the maser lines provide high precision information on the location and velocity of the excited gas and on the physical conditions , notably the magnetic field ( e.g.cohen 1989 and references therein ) .",
    "if more than one oh maser transition is detected from the same compact region then it is possible to better constrain the other physical conditions such as gas temperature and density , the dust temperature , and so on ( e.g.gray et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "however the detection of maser transitions of rotationally excited oh is not very efficient , with current equipment . among three allowed transitions of the excited @xmath1 , @xmath2=1/2 state of oh only the 4765-mhz ( @xmath3=1@xmath00 ) line",
    "is usually seen , but even this is very rare ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a typical profile of a 4765-mhz source contains a single narrow unpolarized feature of intensity of a few hundred mjy which is usually variable on timescales that can be as short as a few weeks ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact several sources have been detected only during episodes of flaring .",
    "the two well known star - forming regions cepa and w75n recently detected in the 4765-mhz line @xcite appear to belong to this class of objects that experience flaring .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,<,^,^,>,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the important conclusion that can be inferred from the merlin observations of the two targets is that the 4765-mhz and 1720-mhz masers appear within the same velocity ranges and coincide in the sky well within the position uncertainties .",
    "this finding is especially valuable for cepa as the observations of the two transitions were carried out at two epochs only 2.5 months apart . for this source",
    "the position of group b of the 4765-mhz components differs by less than 40mas from that of the 1720-mhz emission , while the central velocities of features at both transitions do not differ by more than 0.14kms@xmath4 .",
    "it is therefore highly probable that the 4765- and 1720-mhz lines originate in the same gas volume .    the flux density at 4765mhz decayed with time as given by equation 1 using @xmath5 ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "this gives an extrapolated flux density of 45mjy on 1999 may 20 , the epoch of the 1720-mhz observation .",
    "this implies a ratio of @xmath625 ( @xmath75 ) between the peak flux densities at 1720 and 4765mhz .",
    "such an intensity ratio can be explained using the model by @xcite if there is no overlap between the pump line transitions for the different maser lines , assuming far infrared pumping .",
    "this occurs for regions with an h@xmath8 number density , @xmath9 , of 4@xmath1010@xmath11@xmath12 and an oh number density , @xmath13 , of 2@xmath1010@xmath14@xmath12 over a wide kinetic temperature range from 100 @xmath0 200k .",
    "if there is a large - scale velocity field of up to 1.7kms@xmath4 across the masing region , line overlap allows the 1720-mhz maser to survive to higher densities with @xmath9 up to a few @xmath1010@xmath15@xmath12 .    under similar conditions saturated gain",
    "is predicted at both 1720- and 4765-mhz , as shown in fig.12 of @xcite .",
    "their model also predicts the absence of the main line ground state oh masers and the other two 4.7-ghz lines .",
    "this is fully consistent with our observations : no emission was detected at 1665 or 1667mhz , with a typical rms of 5mjy in a projected area @xmath16 centred at feature b of the 4765-mhz emission ( niezurawska et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "moreover , our upper limits to emission at 4660- and 4750mhz show that the 4765-mhz emission is at least 5 times stronger .",
    "we note that the gain length of the 4765-mhz emission calculated by @xcite is of the same order as the projected linear size of 4@xmath1010@xmath17 cm of maser structure in cepa for the assumed distance of 725pc .    our lower limit for the brightness temperature of 4765-mhz masers of 7@xmath1010@xmath15k in cepa does not preclude saturation . very long baseline interferometry observations of w3(oh ) and two other star forming regions have revealed angular sizes of 4765-mhz components as small as a few mas , implying brightness temperatures up to 10@xmath18k ( @xcite ; @xcite ) which can be reached due to saturated amplification .",
    "the relationship between the linewidth and the peak flux density for feature a established from single@xmath0dish observations @xcite appears to be consistent with a model of saturated maser emission .",
    "the newly detected 1720/4765-mhz oh maser components in cepa are located 28 to the south@xmath0west of the previously known clusters of 1665-and 1667-mhz masers observed by @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite . comparison with the 1.3-cm continuum map reported by @xcite reveals that our oh masers lie about 05 to the s@xmath0w of the centre of the weak ( 2.3mjy ) continuum source ( labelled as 3b in fig.1 ) elongated at a position angle of about 50 .",
    "they are accompanied by four weak ( @xmath190.3jy ) 22-ghz h@xmath8o maser components grouped in a velocity range from @xmath014.8kms@xmath4 to @xmath012.8kms@xmath4 and aligned almost parallel to the source axis .",
    "not obvious velocity gradient is seen along the water maser emission @xcite .",
    "the 1720/4765-mhz masers lie just at the s@xmath0w edge of this structure 016 from the nearest @xmath012.8kms@xmath4 water component .",
    "the overall arc@xmath0like structure of the 4765-mhz maser in cepa has a projected size of 4@xmath1010@xmath17 cm and shows a velocity gradient along the axis of continuum source 3b , with a velocity dispersion of 3.1kms@xmath4 .",
    "the adjacent 22-ghz water components exhibit a velocity dispersion of 2kms@xmath4 over a projected size of 4@xmath1010@xmath20 cm .",
    "these data clearly suggest a kinetically complex medium where the velocity field may be dominated by turbulence ( e.g.@xcite ) . the presence of turbulence in cepa has also been demonstrated by proper motion studies @xcite .",
    "the source labelled 3b in fig.1 is characterized by a flat spectral index between 1.5-ghz and 15-ghz indicative of optically thin thermal emission @xcite which may arise from shock heated gas excited by an external source .",
    "the adjacent sources 2 , 3c and 3d show positive spectral indices @xmath21 ( convention @xmath22 ) suggesting an internal source of energy .",
    "it has been postulated that source 3b may be at the earliest evolutionary stage among these four sources @xcite .",
    "however , our detection of the 1720/4765-mhz masers does not support that .",
    "the presence of weak h@xmath8o masers @xcite and oh masers in two lines has been interpreted as being due to object 3b being ionised by an embedded b2 zams star @xcite .",
    "if source 3b harbours a star then for the assumed distance of 725pc the excited oh masers arise at a projected separation of 5@xmath1010@xmath20 cm . the edge of the molecular cloud , where @xmath23@xmath12 , hosts a magnetic field of strength @xmath24 mg , which scales with number density as @xmath25 ( @xcite and references therein ) , consistent with compression of the interstellar magnetic field during star formation .",
    "our measurements of 1720-mhz zeeman splitting ( section 3.1 ) imply a magnetic field strength of at least 17.3 mg in the oh maser region .",
    "this leads to an estimate of @xmath26@xmath12 .",
    "this value agrees well with the theoretical prediction for the 1720-/4765-mhz masers @xcite .",
    "the 4765-mhz emission from cep a showed pronounced variability , decreasing by a factor of 4 over a period of 7 weeks .",
    "the merlin data are consistent with single dish data previously reported by @xcite , assuming that feature a corresponds to the peak discovered in the single@xmath0dish observations .",
    "more recent data taken with the toru antenna suggest the maser flux density continues to decline to 0.2jy or below ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the temporal characteristic of the 4765-mhz emission of cepa seem to resemble that observed in monr2 @xcite .",
    "it seems that the 1720-mhz maser also varies on a time scale of weeks .",
    "it is remarkable that cepa showed no 1720-mhz emission for many years throughout the 1980 s , with upper limits of 0.1 to 0.3jy being regularly observed ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the emission turned on some time between july 1994 , when the upper limit was 0.3jy ( masheder & cohen , in preparation ) , and june 1995 , when a pair of emission features appeared at @xmath62jy with velocities of @xmath015.9 and @xmath013.9kms@xmath4 ( cohen , unpublished data ) .",

    "* variability of the strongest feature ( a ) of the 4765-mhz line in cep a over the period from 1998 july 07 to 2001 december 27 .",
    "the open circles correspond to the single dish data @xcite and unpublished observations , the arrow marks an upper limit , and dots represent the merlin data analysed in this paper .",
    "the 4765-mhz maser emission discovered towards w75n coincides in velocity ( @xmath190.1kms@xmath4 ) and position ( @xmath1960mas ) with the 1720-mhz maser mapped with merlin about 6.5 years earlier by @xcite , the zeeman pair z@xmath27 .",
    "the 4765-mhz components in w75n are located between two clusters of 1665-mhz oh masers at mean velocities of @xmath28=7.3kms@xmath4 ( northern ) and @xmath2910.6kms@xmath4 ( southern ) labelled as 3 and 4 by @xcite .",
    "the 22-ghz h@xmath8o masers at 10.7kms@xmath4 and 12.6kms@xmath4 reported by @xcite lie about @xmath6200  mas north of the group b of 4765-mhz maser emission .",
    "the 1720-/4765-mhz components of w75n are projected at the s@xmath0w edge of the hii region labelled ba ( vla1 ) by @xcite , which has a spectral index of about 0.7 between 8.5-ghz and 22-ghz .",
    "this indicates partially optically thick emission from an ionized biconical jet @xcite .",
    "the 1720-/4765-mhz masers lie at the s@xmath0w edge of a molecular outflow at distance of 054 from the centre of the 22-ghz continuum emission .",
    "for the assumed distance of w75n of 2kpc the projected distance of the 1720-/4765-mhz masers from a central star is 1.6@xmath1010@xmath30 cm .",
    "the oh maser emission from w75n has been modelled in detail by @xcite .",
    "their model predicts 4765-mhz emission from + 7 to + 12kms@xmath4 and 1720-mhz emission from + 12 to + 13kms@xmath4 ( figs . 4 and 5 in that paper ) , in good agreement with the velocities and positions found here .",
    "the physical conditions in the region where 1720-mhz and 4765-mhz coincide in the model are as follows : @xmath31 = 5@xmath1010@xmath32@xmath12 , @xmath13 = 5@xmath1010@xmath33@xmath12 , kinetic temperature @xmath34 = 9.7  k , dust temperature @xmath35 = 45  k. these are much denser and colder than the conditions thought to prevail in the typical oh - hii region w3(oh ) where the amplification paths are much longer , the oh masers are much more powerful and intense , and are thought to lie in a shocked molecular envelope surrounding the expanding hii region . in w75n",
    "the molecular gas is cooler and denser and is associated with a rotating molecular disc and bipolar outflow , at an earlier evolutionary phase than w3(oh ) .    in both sources we found the association of 1720- and 4765-mhz oh masers that strongly supports the model by @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the modelling of @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite poorly fits our data .    a strong association between 4765- and 6035-mhz",
    "oh transitions has been reported recently by @xcite .",

    "oh masers were detected towards cepa in a velocity range from @xmath010 to @xmath08kms@xmath4 @xcite . towards",
    "w75n they found only the 6035-mhz emission in a velocity range from 7 to 8kms@xmath4 .",
    "these data imply that in both sourcs the 6031-/6035-mhz masers do not coincide in velocity with the 1720-/4765-mhz masers .",
    "no information is available where the 6031-/6035-mhz masers are located .",
    "two star@xmath0forming regions cepa and w75n have been mapped in the 4765- and 1720-mhz maser lines .",
    "components of the excited oh emission at 4765mhz form arc and linear structures of projected size 4@xmath1010@xmath36 1@xmath1010@xmath20 cm with a very well defined velocity gradient .",
    "these structures lie at projected distances of @xmath37 cm from the central star and its surrounding hii region . in both sources",
    "the two maser lines show a good spatial coincidence within the uncertainty of @xmath635mas and demagnetised velocity pairing within the 0.2kms@xmath4 spectral resolution , implying that the 4765-/1720-mhz masers originate from the same gas volume .",
    "no emission of any other 1.6- and 4.7-ghz oh transitions was found in these regions . including the present data there are now three examples of co - propagating 1720-mhz and 4765-mhz masers , where the positional association has been verified to within @xmath630  milliarcseconds .    *",
