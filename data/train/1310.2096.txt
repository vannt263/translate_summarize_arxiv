    "galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) provide a powerful tool to investigate the structure and the formation history of the milky way .",
    "indeed , they are fundamental probes of the galactic gravitational potential shape , from the outer region of the galaxy ( see @xcite ) to the inner bulge ( @xcite ) . the currently and most widely accepted picture for the formation of the galactic gc system ( @xcite , @xcite ) points toward an accreted origin for the outer ( @xmath9 kpc ) young halo ( yh ) gcs , while a large number of the inner , old halo ( oh ) clusters probably formed via dissipationless collapse , coevally with the collapse of the protogalaxy .",
    "the finding of several oh , metal - poor gcs with a thick disc - like kinematics ( @xcite ) , sets a tight constraint on the epoch of the formation of the galactic disc .",
    "moreover , the demonstration that several yh gcs are kinematically associated with satellites of the milky way , such as the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( hereafter sgr dsph , see for instance @xcite ) , gives important clues as to how the galaxy was built up through merger episodes .",
    "the sgr dsph ( @xcite , @xcite ) also provides one of the best opportunities to study the shape , orientation and mass of the milky way dark matter halo through investigation of its luminous tidal streams .",
    "recent studies have highlighted a so - called halo conundrum ( @xcite ) , showing that the available models were not able to reproduce simultaneously the angular position , distance and radial - velocity trends of leading tidal debris .",
    "@xcite claim to have solved this conundrum by introducing a non - axisymmetric component to the galactic gravitational potential that can be described as a triaxial halo perpendicular to the milky way disc . even if poorly motivated within the current cold dark matter paradigm , these findings have subsequently been confirmed by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite fail to reproduce plausible models of disc galaxies using such a scenario . in order to make substantial progress towards a solution of this debate ,",
    "new observational data are needed , starting from accurate proper motions ( pms ) .",
    "the existence of other peculiar systems like @xmath10  centauri ( @xcite ) and terzan  5 ( @xcite ) harboring stellar populations with significant iron - abundance differences ( @xmath11[fe / h]@xmath12 dex ) supports a complex formation scenario for the galactic halo and the bulge .",
    "therefore , a detailed description of the kinematical properties of the galactic gc system is a crucial requirement to obtain new and stronger constraints on the formation history of our galaxy . in this sense ,",
    "publicly - available catalogs of absolute pms for several galactic gcs are of great importance .",
    "a notable example is the ground - based yale / san juan southern proper motion catalog ( @xcite , @xcite and the following papers of the series ) .",
    "these kinds of studies are extremely difficult in regions of the sky where different stellar populations overlap ( such as towards the bulge ) and the associated uncertainties are typically large , ranging between @xmath13 @xmath2and @xmath14 @xmath2(@xcite , @xcite ) . in this sense the _ hubble space telescope _",

    "we present and discuss accurate pms of stars in the cluster s direction .",
    "this paper is part of , and uses techniques developed in the context of , the hstpromo collaboration , a set of hst projects aimed at improving our dynamical understanding of stars , clusters , and galaxies in the nearby universe through measurement and interpretation of proper motions .",
    "as it happens , ngc  6681 is located in an extremely interesting region of the sky : it overlaps the main body of the sgr dsph . with the extraordinarily high photometric and astrometric accuracy of _ hst",
    "_ we have been able to separate the two populations and measure their individual absolute pms .",
    "this is the first time that the pm of ngc  6681 has been estimated .",
    "the paper is structured as follows :  in section 2 we describe the _ hst _ data sets used for our investigation , providing a brief summary of our data - reduction procedure ;  in section 3 the relative pms of our sources are presented ;  in section 4 we describe our method for obtaining absolute pms , by defining the zero - point reference frame and by quantifying possible systematic errors ;  finally , in section 5 we present the results of our analysis .",
    "in order to measure the pms in the direction of ngc  6681 we used two _ hst _ data sets . the one used as first epoch was acquired under go-10775 ( pi :  sarajedini ) .",
    "it consists of a set of high - resolution images obtained with the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for survey ( acs ) .",
    "the wfc / acs is made up of two @xmath22 pixel detectors with a pixel scale of @xmath23pixel@xmath7 and separated by a gap of about 50 pixels , for a total field of view ( fov ) of @xmath24 . for our investigation",
    "we used four deep exposures in both the f606w and the f814w filters ( with exposure times of @xmath25 sec and @xmath26 sec , respectively ) , taken on may 20 , 2006 .",
    "we work here exclusively with the _ flc images , which have been corrected with the pixel - based correction in the pipeline ( @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "the second - epoch data set is composed of proprietary data obtained through go-12516 ( pi :  ferraro ) .",
    "this program consists of several deep , high - resolution images taken with the uvis channel of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) in the f390w , f555w and f814w filters .",
    "the wfc3 uvis camera is made of two @xmath27 pixel chips , separated by a gap of approximately 30 pixels .",
    "its pixel scale is @xmath28pixel@xmath7 and the total fov is @xmath29 .",
    "the sample analyzed in this work consists of @xmath30s images in f555w and @xmath31s images in f814w .",
    "these images have not been corrected for cte losses , since no pixel - based correction was available at the time of this reduction .",
    "these images were taken relatively soon after installation and background in these images is greater than 12 electrons , so any cte losses should be small , particularly for the bright stars we are focusing on here ( see @xcite ) . since these observations were taken on november 5 , 2011 , the two data sets provide a temporal baseline of @xmath32 yrs .",
    "the data - reduction procedures are described in detail in @xcite . here",
    "we provide only a brief description of the main steps of the analysis . the first step was to reduce each individual exposure .",
    "we analyzed the first epoch with the publicly available program ` img2xym\\_wfc.09\\times10 ` , which is documented in @xcite .",
    "this program uses a pre - determined model of spatially varying psfs plus a single time - dependent perturbation psf ( to account for focus changes or spacecraft breathing ) .",
    "the final output is a catalog with instrumental positions and magnitudes for each exposure .",
    "we followed the same approach for the second epoch , by using the program ` img2xym\\_wfc3uv ` , which is similar to the acs program described above .",
    "we corrected the star positions in each catalog for geometric distortion , by means of the solution provided by @xcite for the acs camera and by @xcite for the wfc3 .",
    "as a consistency check , we built the wfc3/uvis ( _ m_@xmath33 , _",
    "m_@xmath15_m_@xmath16 ) cmd of ngc  6681 .",
    "the f555w sample was constructed by selecting stars in common among at least 4 out of 9 single - exposure catalogs , while the f814w sample is made up of those stars detected in at least 5 out of 13 single - exposure catalogs .",
    "the cmd resulting from these two samples is shown in figure [ vvi ] .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes have been calibrated onto the vegamag system using aperture corrections and zeropoints reported in the wfc3 web page .",
    "the cmd exhibits well - defined cluster evolutionary sequences .",
    "the main sequence ( ms ) extends to almost @xmath34 magnitudes below the turn off ( to ) region .",
    "another bluer sequence is visible at _ m_@xmath35 mag and @xmath18_m_@xmath15_m_@xmath36 mag and remains well separated from the cluster ms . in the following sections we will demonstrate , by means of pm membership , that it corresponds to the ms of the sgr dsph ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the red giant branch ( rgb ) and the horizontal branch ( hb ) of the cluster are almost entirely above the saturation limit and thus are excluded from the pm analysis .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the stellar populations in ngc  6681 will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "is shown as a red solid line .",
    "the @xmath37 uncertainties are traced as dashed red lines .",
    "the labels indicate the value of the best fit slope . _ lower panel _ :  the same for the radial pm component . ]",
    "the first step in measuring relative pms was to astrometrically relate each exposure to a distortion - free reference frame , which from now on we will refer to as the master frame .",
    "we chose the public catalog of ngc  6681 provided by the acs survey of galactic gcs ( @xcite , @xcite ) as the master frame .",
    "we re - scaled this to the uvis pixel - scale ( 40 @xmath38 ) for convenience .",
    "we transformed the measured position of each star in each exposure into the reference frame by means of a six - parameter linear transformation based on the positions of member stars in the reference frame and the individual frames . to maximize the accuracy of these transformations we treated each chip of our exposures separately , in order to avoid spurious effects related to the presence of the gap .",
    "as a second step , we selected a sample of reference stars with respect to which our pms would be computed . for convenience ,",
    "we chose to compute all pms relative to the mean motion of the cluster . therefore our reference list is based on likely cluster members .",
    "these were initially selected on the basis of their location on the cmd .",
    "we included in the list only well - measured , unsaturated stars .",
    "then , for each star in each catalog , we computed the position on the master frame using a transformation based on only the closest 50 reference stars .    at the end of the process , for each star we have up to @xmath39 first - epoch positions and up to @xmath40 second - epoch positions on the master frame . to estimate the relative motion of each star we adopted a 3@xmath41-clipping algorithm and computed the median x and y positions of each star in the first and in the second epoch .",
    "the difference between the two median positions gives the star s x and y displacements in @xmath42 years .",
    "the errors in each direction and within each epoch ( @xmath43 ) were computed as the rms of the positional residuals about the median value , divided by the square root of the number of measurements @xmath44 :  @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the error in each pm - component associated to each star is simply the sum in quadrature between first- and second - epoch errors :  @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    with this first pm determination , we went back to our original reference - star list and removed those sources whose motion was not consistent with the cluster s mean motion , ( 0,0 ) @xmath2by construction .",
    "we repeated the entire procedure three times , after which the number of stars in the reference list stopped changing . to be conservative",
    ", we decided to build the final pm catalog taking into account only the 30@xmath6546 stars having at least 3 position measurements in each epoch .",
    "the typical error for well - exposed stars is smaller than 0.002 pixel yr@xmath7 in each coordinate , i.e. smaller than 0.07 @xmath2 as shown in fig .",
    "[ err ] .",
    "we converted the pms into units of @xmath2by multiplying the measured displacements by the pixel scale of the master frame ( previously re - scaled to @xmath48pixel ) and dividing by the temporal baseline ( @xmath49 yrs ) . since the master frame is already oriented according to the equatorial coordinate system , the x pm - component corresponds to that projected along ( negative ) right ascension ( @xmath50 ) , while the y pm - component to that along declination ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the output of this analysis is summarized in figure [ relpm ] , where in the upper panels we show the vector point diagrams ( vpds ) and in the lower panels the corresponding cmds .",
    "close inspections of the vpds suggest that at least three populations with distinct kinematics can be identified in the direction of ngc  6681 .    1",
    ".   the cluster population is identified by the clump of stars at ( 0,0 ) @xmath2 . by selecting stars within the blue circle in the second upper panel ,",
    "a clean cmd of the cluster is obtained ( second lower panel of fig .",
    "[ relpm ] ) .",
    "a secondary clump of stars is located at roughly @xmath52 @xmath2 .",
    "stars selected within the red circle in the third upper panel of fig .  [ relpm ] define in the cmd ( the third lower panel ) a sequence significantly fainter than that defined by cluster stars ( as already noticed in the previous section ) .",
    "therefore , these stars belong to a population that is both kinematically and photometrically different from that of the cluster .",
    "this population appears uniformly distributed across the fov of our observations and thus it can be associated to the sgr dsph , whose main body is located in the background of ngc  6681 . 3 .   a much sparser population of stars is centered around @xmath53 @xmath2 .",
    "the bulk of this population is highlighted with the green circle in the last upper panel of fig .",
    "[ relpm ] .",
    "the corresponding cmd suggests that this is essentially due to fore / background sources .",
    "in this section we describe how we determined the absolute reference frame zero point in order to bring our relative pms ( section 3 ) into an absolute system .      in order to measure absolute pms ,",
    "an absolute zero point is required . the best option to define this",
    "zero point is to use extragalactic sources , since they are essentially stationary on account of their enormous distances .",
    "this method has already been adopted in several previous works , such as @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite . in order to find extragalactic sources we first tried to use the nasa extragalactic database but found that it is incomplete in the innermost regions of dense stellar systems like gcs , and provides no detectable sources in our fov .",
    "we then performed a careful visual inspection of our images .",
    "thirty - one galaxies were identified by eye , but only 11 of them have point - like nuclei and thus are successfully fitted by the adopted psf . out of these",
    ", we selected only the 5 galaxies with an associated qfit value ( see @xcite for details ) smaller than @xmath54 :  this was necessary to guarantee a measurement of the source centroid accurate enough to provide a precise determination of the zero point for the absolute pms .",
    "figure [ gal ] shows how these galaxies appear in the f814w band .",
    "the selected galaxies are located very close to each other in the relative - pm vpd ( fig .",
    "[ gal_pm ] ) , as expected for distant sources .",
    "therefore , we defined the zero - point of the absolute reference frame as the weighted mean of their relative pms ( see the blue dot in figure [ gal_pm ] ) : @xmath55 as measured with respect to the mean ngc  6681 motion derived in section 5.1 .",
    "the uncertainties correspond to the error on the calculated weighted means . in order to check",
    "whether the quoted uncertainties could be underestimated by taking into account only the individual pm errors , we computed the reduced @xmath56 of the scatter of the five galaxies around their weighted mean .",
    "the resulting values are @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the two pm components respectively .",
    "these values suggest a reasonable estimate for the @xmath51 component uncertainty , and a possible overestimate of the @xmath59 component error .",
    "however , given the small sample of galaxies , the @xmath60 statistics could be not fully reliable .",
    "therefore we maintained the quoted uncertainties throughout the following analysis .",
    "since any measurement of absolute pms relies on the accuracy of the absolute reference frame determination , it is important to look for possible sources of systematic errors and , if any is found , to quantify their impact .",
    "one of these sources could be the possible rotation of ngc  6681 on the plane of the sky . because we used only cluster stars to define the ( linear ) transformation between each exposure and the reference frame ,",
    "if the cluster is rotating , then our frame will also be rotating .",
    "as such , if ngc  6681 has any component of rotation in the plane of the sky , our procedure would have introduced an artificial rotation ( equal in modulus but opposite in sign ) to background and foreground objects around the cluster center .",
    "ngc  6681 shows a very small ellipticity ( @xmath61 ; @xcite , 2010 edition ) .",
    "hence , from the relationship between ellipticity and the rotational parameter @xmath62 ( @xmath63 and @xmath41 being , respectively , the cluster rotational velocity and velocity dispersion ; @xcite ) , we can reasonably expect that @xmath64 at @xmath65 , with @xmath66 being the half - light radius , at least for the edge - on component of rotation . if the face - on and edge - on components are similar , we can calculate an upper limit to the rotational velocity of @xmath67 , using @xmath68 km@xmath6s@xmath7 , @xmath69 and the distance @xmath70 kpc ( all from @xcite , 2010 edition ) .",
    "this value corresponds to a rotational pm of 0.084 @xmath2at a distance of @xmath8 from the cluster center .",
    "this is comparable to the random errors in our absolute astrometry ( eq .  [ [ eqabsolute ] ] ) .",
    "hence we need to carefully check for the possible presence of a rotational component on the plane of the sky . to this end",
    "we selected sgr dsph members since their small pm dispersion ( compared to field stars ) produces more stringent limits on the measured rotation values .",
    "note that the sgr dsph does not rotate ( @xcite ) , at least it should not rotate around the center of ngc  6681 .",
    "thus any possible rotation signal would belong to the cluster .",
    "we selected sgr dsph stars from the cmd ( in the intervals @xmath71 _ m_@xmath72 mag and @xmath18_m_@xmath15 _ m_@xmath20 mag ) and from the vpd , rejecting sources that lay beyond @xmath73 @xmath2from its pm bulk distribution .",
    "in addition , we rejected stars with a pm uncertainty larger than @xmath74 @xmath2 .",
    "seventy three stars survived these selection criteria .",
    "we decomposed their pm vectors into radial ( @xmath75 ) and tangential ( @xmath76 ) components with respect to the center of ngc  6681 .",
    "the resulting distributions of the @xmath75 and @xmath77 components as a function of the distance @xmath78 from the cluster s center are shown in figure [ introt ] .",
    "we fitted these distributions with a straight line , forced through the origin ( functional form @xmath79 ) since at @xmath80 any internal cluster mean motion ( rotation in the pm tangential component and contraction / expansion in the radial direction ) is zero . we determined the angular coefficient @xmath81 by calculating the minimum of the function d(@xmath60)/d@xmath81 and we defined the errors using the @xmath81-values corresponding to @xmath82 . in this approach , we defined @xmath83 , where @xmath41 is the scatter of the points around the best fit ( @xmath84 mas yr@xmath7 ) . hence , the inferred errors on @xmath81 take into account the observed scatter ( which includes contributions from the internal velocity dispersion of the sgr dsph stars ) , and not merely the formal random errors on the individual pm measurements .",
    "the best fits of the two distributions give the following slope values :  @xmath85 @xmath86and @xmath87 @xmath86 .",
    "the fits are shown in figure [ introt ] with red solid lines ( the @xmath88 uncertainty in the fit is shown as red dashed lines ) .",
    "our estimated rotation signal ( @xmath89 @xmath86 ) corresponds to @xmath90 km@xmath6s@xmath7 at @xmath91 from the cluster center , fully consistent with zero .",
    "this firmly demonstrates that the cluster rotation is negligible in the plane of the sky .",
    "this contrasts with the case of e.g. @xmath10  cen ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite ( ak03 ) estimated the rotation of 47  tuc from the difference of the motion of the small magellanic cloud ( located behind the cluster ) in two pointings on opposite sides of the cluster .",
    "similar to ak03 , in this work we have used stars in a background association as a zero - rotation reference to obtain very precise limits on the plane - of - sky rotation of a globular cluster .",
    "this is the first time , however , that such a measurement has been made using only one observed pointing at the cluster center .",
    "we want to stress that this has only been possible thanks to the small dispersion of the sgr dsph pms , which translates into a high accuracy in the determination of a possible rotation signal .",
    "since the rotation turned out to be consistent with zero to within the uncertainties , we can assume that pms of background galaxies are not affected by any cluster - rotation effect . to be conservative , however , we used the uncertainty on the slope @xmath92 to quantify the possible systematic error on the determination of the absolute reference frame .",
    "we computed the radial and tangential components of the pms of the 5 selected galaxies and added to the tangential motion of each galaxy a term @xmath93 ( where @xmath94 is the distance of each galaxy from the cluster center ) .",
    "then we re - calculated the weighted - mean relative pm value , which defines the absolute zero point .",
    "the difference with respect to the previous determination is @xmath95 @xmath2and @xmath96 @xmath2 . these systematic errors on the determination of the absolute reference frame are significantly smaller than the random errors ( eq .  [ [ eqabsolute ] ] ) , and we therefore ignore them in the following .",
    "it is also important to be aware of possible contributions from parallax to measured positional shifts between observations taken at different epochs .",
    "compared to distant background sources , a foreground object will move annually on a parallactic ellipse of semi - major axis length @xmath97 ( 10 kpc / d ) mas .",
    "the positional shift thus introduced between two observations at random times separated by a baseline @xmath98 is at most twice this value .",
    "this yields an apparent pm of size @xmath99 .",
    "for our ngc  6681 observations , @xmath100 kpc and @xmath101 yr , so that @xmath102 mas yr@xmath7 .",
    "this is well below the uncertainties in our absolute reference frame .",
    "so while it is not difficult to correct for parallax explicitly , we have not done so in the present context .",
    "the sgr dsph is farther away than ngc  6681 , so any systematic errors in its pm due to parallax would be correspondingly smaller .",
    "there are many other possible sources of systematic error that can affect absolute astrometry with _",
    "hst _ is a very stable instrument , and most authors use analysis software that is based on the concepts in @xcite .",
    "therefore , most systematic errors should be similar in magnitude between different studies . @xcite",
    "achieved systematic errors @xmath103 @xmath2 in studies of m31 and leo  i using techniques that are very similar to those used here .",
    "this is significantly smaller than the random errors in our absolute reference frame ( see eq .  [ [ eqabsolute ] ] ) .",
    "the fact that our results are not significantly affected by unknown systematics is also supported by comparison of our pm results with those of other authors ( see section  5.2 below ) , which show good agreement to within the random uncertainties .",
    "in this section we present the results for the absolute pms of the three populations under investigation .",
    "each measurement quoted in the following subsections refers to figure [ absolute ] , where the blue crosses correspond to the absolute pm estimate of each population and the blue ellipses to their uncertainty .      in order to measure the absolute pm of ngc  6681 we selected only stars @xmath104 @xmath2from the cluster mean motion and in the magnitude interval @xmath71_m_@xmath105 mag .",
    "we iteratively refined the selection by applying a @xmath106 rejection and re - calculating the barycenter of the pms as the weighted mean value of the pms of the selected stars , until the difference between two subsequent steps was smaller than @xmath107 @xmath2 .",
    "after the last iterative step , a total of @xmath108 stars survived the selection criteria .",
    "we used the sum in quadrature between each single measurement error and the velocity dispersion of the cluster @xmath109 mas / yr ( based on the line - of - sight velocity dispersion and distance given by @xcite ) as weights . to estimate the error @xmath110 on the weighted mean pm in each coordinate we use the standard error - in - the - mean , i.e. , the dispersion of the surviving stars around the weighted mean pm , divided by @xmath111 .",
    "this includes scatter from the internal dispersion of ngc  6681 stars , which therefore does not need to be estimated explicitly .",
    "we find that the resulting error @xmath110 is negligible compared to the error on the absolute reference frame .",
    "therefore , the latter dominates the uncertainty on the final absolute pm of ngc  6681 , which is:@xmath112    the pm derived here can be combined with the known distance and line - of - sight velocity of ngc  6681 from @xcite , to determine the motion of the cluster in the galactocentric rest frame . using the same formalism , conventions , and solar motion as in @xcite , this yields @xmath113",
    "this corresponds to a total galactocentric velocity @xmath114 km@xmath6s@xmath7 .",
    "this significantly exceeds the central velocity dispersion @xmath115 km@xmath6s@xmath7 of the milky way s spheroidal components ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , ngc  6681 must spend most of the time along its orbit at significantly larger distances from the galactic center than its current distance of @xmath116 kpc ( @xcite ) .      in order to determine the absolute pm of the sgr dsph we basically followed the same procedure previously described for ngc  6681 . in setting the weights for the pm",
    "averaging , we used the dispersion @xmath117 @xmath2implied by figure 6 .",
    "this includes both contributions from the internal velocity dispersion of the sgr dsph ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and unquantified systematic errors .",
    "we selected stars within @xmath104 @xmath2from the sgr dsph mean motion and in the interval @xmath71_m_@xmath118 , which is one magnitude fainter with respect to the case of ngc  6681 , since most of the sgr dsph stars belong to its faint ms .",
    "the resulting absolute pm is:@xmath119    we compared this value with previous estimates . with the aim of reconstructing the kinematical history of this galaxy and to predict its evolution in a triaxial milky way halo , @xcite built a n - body model able to reproduce most of the system s observed properties . in the law & majewski model ,",
    "the sgr dsph has a galactocentric motion @xmath120 km@xmath6s@xmath7 , corresponding to a total velocity @xmath121 km@xmath6s@xmath7 .",
    "the absolute pm predicted by the model is ( @xmath122 ) @xmath2(light green dot in figure [ absolute ] ) .",
    "an estimate of the absolute pm of the sgr dsph based on _ hst _ data has been recently presented by @xcite .",
    "the authors used foreground galactic stellar populations as reference frame and they determined an absolute pm of ( @xmath123 ) @xmath2 , which is shown as a magenta ellipse in figure [ absolute ] . a ground - based estimate of the absolute pm of the sgr dsph was presented by @xcite . using the southern proper motion catalog 3 they determined that @xmath124 @xmath2 , which is shown as the dark green ellipse in figure [ absolute ] .",
    "these previous estimates are in rough agreement with the value determined here .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that these other determinations are not directly comparable with ours , since they refer to different regions of the sgr dsph .",
    "indeed , this has two possible effects .",
    "the first one is that possible internal motions , such as rotation , could translate into different mean motions , thus introducing a systematic effect .",
    "this should not be a problem for the sgr dsph , since this galaxy does not show any evidence of rotation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second effect is that if the whole galaxy has a 3d velocity vector different from zero , then the observed pms for different pointings are not the same , because of perspective effects due to the imperfect parallelism between the lines of sight ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the sgr dsph is a nearby galaxy , this effect could be relevant and we calculated the correction to apply ( as in @xcite ) in order to obtain comparable estimates at the center of mass of the sgr dsph .    under",
    "the hypothesis that the center of mass of the sgr dsph is moving as the @xcite prediction , our perspective - corrected pm measurement becomes ( @xmath125 ) @xmath2 . the corrected @xcite estimate becomes ( @xmath126 ) @xmath2 , and the corrected @xcite estimate becomes @xmath127 @xmath2 .",
    "thus our measurement is consistent with the previous observations .",
    "the weighted average of all observational estimates of the center - of - mass pm of the sgr dsph is @xmath128 @xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical model of @xcite , once the uncertainties on transforming that into a pm value ( e.g. , from uncertainties in the distance and solar motion ) are taken into account as well .",
    "therefore , our measurement is consistent within about a @xmath37 uncertainty both with theoretical predictions ( @xcite ) and the previous _ hst _ observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "we compared the absolute pms of field stars in our catalog with those predicted in the same region of sky by the besanon galactic model ( @xcite ) .",
    "we generated a simulation over a 0.01 square degrees ( @xmath129 ) fov around the center of ngc  6681 ( @xmath130.@xmath131 , @xmath132.@xmath133 ) and 50 kpc deep .",
    "to minimize any possible bias , we have constructed a sample as similar as possible to the observed stars , based on a comparison between the observed and the simulated cmds .",
    "simulated field stars were selected within the magnitude range :  @xmath71_m_@xmath105 mag and ( _ m_@xmath15_m_@xmath16)@xmath134 mag and 1378 stars survived these criteria .",
    "the average predicted motion is shown in figure [ absolute ] as a cyan ellipse , which corresponds to ( @xmath135 ) @xmath2 .",
    "field stars in our observed catalog were selected following the same color and magnitude cuts .",
    "we also required these stars to have pm errors smaller than @xmath136 @xmath2 in each coordinate .",
    "finally , we excluded those stars within @xmath137 @xmath2of the cluster mean motion and within @xmath104 @xmath2of the sgr dsph mean motion .",
    "we iteratively removed field stars in symmetric locations with respect to the sgr dsph and ngc  6681 exclusions in order to better define the mean motion of the field population and adjusted the weighted mean motion after each iteration ( thus following the method described by @xcite for the determination of the center of @xmath10  cen ) .",
    "the 281 selected field stars used for the final estimate are shown as black crosses in figure [ absolute ] . since these stars display a large scatter in the vpd due to their velocity dispersion and not to their random errors , in this case we computed a statistically more appropriate @xmath106-clipped unweighted mean motion .",
    "it is shown as a blue ellipse in figure [ absolute ] and its value is:@xmath138    our pm measurement is similar to the prediction of the besanon model , in that it points in the same direction on the sky ( see figure  [ absolute ] ) .",
    "however , the sizes of the pm vectors are not formally consistent to within the random errors .",
    "since our measurements for sgr dsph stars are entirely consistent with both previous measurements and theoretical predictions , this can not be due to systematic errors in our measurements ( which would affect all point sources equally ) .",
    "instead , the mismatch is most likely due to shortcomings in the besanon models . in particular ,",
    "for pointings this close to the galactic plane , the model predicted pm distribution is likely to depend sensitively on the adopted dust extinction model , which is poorly constrained observationally .",
    "also , the model predicted pm distribution depends on the solar motion in the milky way , which continues to be debated ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have analyzed two sets of _ hst _ observations separated by a temporal baseline of @xmath49 years in the direction of the galactic gc ngc  6681 in order to obtain the first - ever measurement of its absolute pm , as well as the absolute motions of the sgr dsph and the field population in this direction .",
    "first , we obtained relative pms for a total of about 30@xmath6000 sources .",
    "for the brighter ones , the uncertainties are smaller than @xmath139 @xmath2 in each coordinate .",
    "then , by using background galaxies , we determined the zero - point of the absolute - motion reference frame with an uncertainty of @xmath140 and @xmath141 @xmath2on the @xmath59 and @xmath51 components , respectively .",
    "we also quantified the systematic errors on the definition of the absolute reference frame due to possible internal rotation of ngc  6681 .",
    "we demonstrated that very stringent constraints on the rotation of a gc can be obtained by using non - member populations , provided that their pms have a sufficiently small dispersion .",
    "we used sgr dsph stars as the non - member population and we estimated a rotational velocity for ngc  6681 of @xmath142 km@xmath6s@xmath7 at @xmath143 from the cluster center , consistent with zero .",
    "this corresponds to negligible systematic errors of @xmath144 @xmath2 in the previously quoted pm components .",
    "we measured the absolute pm for the three populations under investigation .",
    "the absolute pm of ngc  6681 is @xmath145 @xmath2 .",
    "we also measured the absolute pm of the sgr dsph and compared it with previous determinations and model predictions .",
    "our estimate is @xmath146 @xmath2 .",
    "after correction for viewing perspective to obtain an estimate of the pm of the sgr dsph center of mass , this value is consistent within about a @xmath37 uncertainty with both the model prediction of @xcite and the perspective corrected measurements of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , we estimated the absolute pm of the field population intercepted along the line of sight to be @xmath147 @xmath2 ."
