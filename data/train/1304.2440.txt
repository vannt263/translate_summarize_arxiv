    "vector magnetographic observations of the solar active regions show that the distribution of the electric current helicity has a pronounced anti - symmetry with respect to the solar equator @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is called the hemispheric sign rule of current helicity . by analysis of the photospheric vector magnetograms of active regions",
    "it has been shown that the current helicity in the northern hemisphere is mainly negative while in the southern hemisphere it is positive . the same hemispheric sign rule was obtained from the synoptic magnetic field maps by @xcite ( see , also , @xcite ) . both kinds of observations deal with the line - of - sight part of current helicity , which can be identified with the total current helicity density using the assumption of the spatial isotropy of the current helicity distribution .",
    "it is possible to relate the current helicity density with the magnetic helicity density taking into account the theoretical assumption on turbulent nature and isotropy of the magnetic fields ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "magnetic helicity is an integral of motion in mhd ( @xcite ) .",
    "this impacts the saturation of the magnetic field generation in the large - scale helical dynamos .",
    "thus , the information about the surface distribution of the current helicity density and about its evolution with the solar cycle may be important for our understanding of the dynamo processes inside the solar convection zone .",
    "it is also important for understanding the processes of the magnetic helicity transport from the convection zone to the corona @xcite .",
    "the observations indicate departure from the hemispheric sign rule @xcite .",
    "it was found that at some periods of the solar cycle the hemispheric sign rule reverses to the opposite , at least at some latitudes and times @xcite .",
    "it was realized that the properties of these reversals may be related with the kind of the dynamo operating in the sun with the distribution of the dynamo processes inside the convection zone , and with the types of the magnetic helicity loss involved in the dynamo ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these mechanisms do not exclude the local processes which may take part in formation of the twisted magnetic field at the subsurface layers .",
    "some of them were brought attention in the literature and could be considered as alternative points of view to the problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze the origin of the current helicity sign rule reversals within the framework of solar mean - field dynamo models . in our study",
    "we examine the dynamo distributed over the convection zone . in this model the global dynamo wave is shaped by the subsurface shear layer @xcite .",
    "our approach is a development of the results of the dynamo model of @xcite which alleviates catastrophic quenching by consideration of total magnetic helicity conservation .",
    "we compare our results with that ones for the solar dynamo operating in overshoot layer at the bottom of the solar convective zone ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our study confronts the results of theoretical modeling with available observational data from huairou solar observing station of chinese academy of sciences .",
    "the details of the model can be found in our previous papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , hereafter p08 ) . here , we briefly outline the basic framework .",
    "we study the mean - field induction equation : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mean velocity ( differential rotation ) ; @xmath2 is the axisymmetric magnetic field : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a polar angle and @xmath5 is a radial distance ; @xmath6 is the mean electromotive force , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 are being the fluctuating velocity and magnetic field , respectively . using the mean - field magnetohydrodynamic framework @xcite we write the @xmath9 as follows : @xmath10 where the turbulent kinetic coefficients are : the @xmath11 effect , @xmath12 ; the turbulent pumping @xmath13 ; the anisotropic diffusivity @xmath14 and the @xmath15 dynamo effect @xcite , @xmath16 .",
    "they depend on the parameters of the turbulent convection , like the mean density and turbulent diffusivity stratification , the coriolis number @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the typical convective turnover time , and @xmath19 is the global angular velocity .",
    "the @xmath11 effect includes the hydrodynamic and magnetic helicity contributions , @xmath20 where the hydrodynamic part of the @xmath11-effect is defined by @xmath21 .",
    "the expressions for the turbulent kinetic coefficients @xmath21 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath16 are given in appendix .",
    "the contribution of small - scale magnetic helicity @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the fluctuating magnetic vector - potential ) to the @xmath11-effect is defined as follows ( see , p08 ) : @xmath24 the principal nonlinear feedback of the large - scale magnetic field to the @xmath11-effect is due to a dynamical quenching because of the generation of the magnetic helicity by the dynamo @xcite .",
    "the relation of magnetic helicity on the large- and small scales @xcite is governed by the equation :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the diffusive flux of the total magnetic helicity @xcite , and @xmath27 is the turbulent diffusion coefficient for the magnetic helicity . in the paper",
    "we use @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the turbulent diffusivity profile ( see , appendix ) . for the axisymmetric magnetic fields the large - scale magnetic vector - potential is @xmath31 the toroidal part of the vector potential",

    "the poloidal part of the vector potential can be restored from equation @xmath32 .",
    "we matched the potential field outside and the perfect conductivity at the bottom boundary with the standard boundary conditions .",

    "the construction of the radial profiles for the turbulent coefficients , which are involved in the mean electromotive force , remains rather arbitrary for various kinds of the dynamo models . in our models we use the solar convection zone model computed by @xcite . in the paper",
    "we use the same profiles for the turbulent coefficients as in our previous papers ( see , @xcite , and appendix therein ) .",

    "the qualitatively similar results can be obtained for the model b2 . here",
    "we see , that the spatial patterns of the small - scale magnetic field follow the evolution of the large - scale magnetic helicity and the latter propagates with the toroidal part of the dynamo wave from the bottom of the convection zone to the surface .",
    "the dynamo wave has the equatorial and the polar branches . near the surface the equatorial branch dominates .",
    "the hemispheric helicity rule suggest that the small - scale helicity is negative at the north and positive at the south hemisphere .",

    "the model b1 is discussed as it shows the stronger reversals of the helicity rule than the model b2 .",
    "we found that the reversals of the helicity rule are stronger during the periods of the grand minimum which are also related to the periods of the strong hemispheric asymmetry in the magnetic activity .",

    "the sunspot number was simulated in following to @xcite .",
    "we also show the integral magnetic helicity for each hemisphere .",
    "the magnitude of the helicity variations is in agreement with the observational constraints obtained by @xcite .",
    "variations of the magnetic helicity go in anti - phase at the large and small scales , because it is prescribed by eq.([eq : helcon ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , for each hemisphere , there is a difference between the evolution of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the small - scale helicity , @xmath35 does change the sign in a course of the solar cycle and the large - scale helicity @xmath48 almost does not .",

    "another interesting results is that the maxima of the integral large - scale magnetic helicity are approximately corresponded to the maxima of the decay rate in the simulated sunspot activity ( cf , figs .",
    "[ fig : fluc2]c , d and fig .",
    "[ fig : fluc2]e ) .",
    "this is due of the oscillatory character of the dynamo and delay between the activity of the major components of the large - scale magnetic fields which are related to the toroidal magnetic field and the large - scale toroidal vector - potential determining the poloidal magnetic field .",

    "[ fig : fluc1 ] shows comparison of the results for the simulated time - latitude diagrams for the toroidal magnetic field and the magnetic helicity with results of the current helicity observations reported by @xcite .",
    "we used systematic series of vector magnetographic observations of solar active regions by 35  cm filter type smtf telescope at huairou solar observing station of chinese academy of sciences .",
    "the data set comprises 6205 individual magnetograms of active regions more or less homogeneously covering the 18 year period of 1988 - 2005 , which is almost two sunspot cycles .",
    "the data have been grouped and averaged into statistically significant sub - samples in time - latitudinal bins ( 2 years in time and 7 degrees in helio - latitude ) , see @xcite for details .",
    "we have subsequently smoothed the data by using standard idl linear interlopation for retaining only global features of the time - latitudinal distribution of helicity .",
    "the results of the dynamo model are shown for the period of the grand minimum .",
    "it is the same period as discussed for the fig .",
    "[ fig : fluc2](c , d , e ) above .",
    "the simulated butterfly diagrams are in visible qualitative agreement with the observations .",
    "one can see that the model keeps the basic anti - symmetry of helicity ( negative in the north and positive in the south , i.e. the so - called hemispheric sign rule ) , however with evolution it shows various deviations from perfect periodicity ( e.g. , longer cycles , suppression of activity , asymmetry in the phases of growth and decay , asymmetry in the shape of wings on butterfly diagrams etc ) .",
    "it looks plausible that long and weak cycles are associated with larger areas of helicity of the sign opposite to the hemispheric sign rule .",
    "the available bulk of the current helicity data covers two activity cycles and the transition to the following activity cycle which has been quite unusual .",
    "the observed helicity butterfly diagrams demonstrate that the size of the areas with the opposite helicity signs in the later cycle differs substantially from the first one .",
    "we studied the origins of the reversals of the magnetic helicity sign in the mean - field solar dynamo .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic helicity in the model subject to the global constraint of the magnetic helicity conservation law .",
    "the nonlinear feedback of the large - scale magnetic field to the @xmath11-effect is described by dynamical quenching due to the constraint of magnetic helicity conservation .",
    "the magnetic helicity , @xmath35 , is subjected to the conservation law .    in the model ,",
    "the sign reversals of the small - scale magnetic helicity are always related with the sign reversals of the large - scale magnetic helicity .",
    "this is due to the magnetic helicity conservation constraint .",
    "the result develops the simple model by @xcite .",
    "the idea was recently elaborated by @xcite for the toroidal part of the current helicity .",
    "our model employs the total large - scale magnetic helicity and not only its toroidal part . taking into account eqs.([eq : bm],[eq : potent ] ) we get the large - scale magnetic helicity formula for the spherical coordinates : @xmath50 where , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we have to notice that the magnetic helicity of the large - scale axisymmetric field can be restored from observational tracers of @xmath53 and @xmath54 either from the vector magnetograms @xcite or from the line - of - sight magnetic observations , e.g. , using method by @xcite .",
    "the toroidal part of the potential can be restored from the surface distribution of the @xmath55 as @xmath56 which is equivalent to the flux going outside of the sun , and , similar , we can restore poloidal part of vector - potential using @xmath57 .",
    "note , that the total helisity remains zero because of the equatorial symmetry of the axisymetric magnetic field .",
    "hence , the using of the coulomb gauge is justified and the determination of the latitudinal distribution of the magnetic helicity of the axisymmetric large - scale magnetic fiel is unique .    therefore , the observations can give an information about the magnetic helicity of the large - scale magnetic fields of the sun .",
    "our results indicate ( see , figs .",
    "[ fig : fluc2](c , d , e ) that the reversal of magnetic helicity and lower values of integral helicity may proceed the lower amplitude of cyclic dynamo activity .",
    "we found that in the models the wave of the reversed magnetic helicity sign propagates from the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "similar property was recently found by @xcite in direct numerical simulations .",
    "the models b1 and b2 show the possibility as for the strongly positive as well for the negative dynamical @xmath11-effect near the top of the convection zone .",
    "the model employs the subsurface rotational shear having the negative radial gradient of the angular velocity .",
    "therefore , in case b1 the dynamo wave penetrates closer to equator than the model b2 because of the parker - yoshimura rule @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations demonstrate a similar effect @xcite .    generally , the sign reversals of the magnetic helicity are stronger in the model b1 than in the model b2 .",
    "these two models have different boundary conditions for the magnetic helicity at the top . in the model b1 the diffusive flux of the large - scale helicity from the surface",
    "is balanced by a counterpart from the small - scale helicity .",
    "therefore , integrating the eq .",
    "( [ eq : b1 ] ) from some level @xmath58 the top @xmath59 we have @xmath60 , where we use the magnetic boundary conditions as well .",
    "thus , in the model b1 , the boundary conditions support the penetration of the local helicity @xmath61 ( governed by eq .",
    "[ eq : helcon ] ) from depth to the surface . for the boundary condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : b2 ] ) we have @xmath62 at the top .",
    "this is the same as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "thus , at the near surface level , in the model b2 the small - scale magnetic helicity is determined by the profile of @xmath65 and not by eq.([eq : helcon ] ) .",
    "the further study requires clarification of the issue if the boundary conditions impact the sign reversals of the magnetic helicity .",
    "we can make conjecture that the change in the boundary conditions results in the larger or smaller sign reversals of the magnetic helicity at the surface .",
    "the main results of the paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "the current model suggests that the reversal of the sign of the small - scale magnetic helicity follows the dynamo wave propagating inside the convection zone .",
    "this was also suggested by the numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "therefore , the spatial patterns of the magnetic helicity reversals reflect the processes which contribute to generation and evolution of the large - scale magnetic fields . at the surface",
    "the patterns of the helicity rule reversals are determined by the magnetic helicity boundary conditions at the top of the convection zone .",

    "following the results of p08 , @xmath13 is expressed as follows : @xmath71    the effect of turbulent diffusivity , which is anisotropic due to the coriolis force , is given by : @xmath72 we also include the nonlinear generation effects which is induced by the large - scale current and the global rotation that is usually called as the @xmath73 effect or the @xmath15 dynamo effect @xcite .",
    "it is supported by the numerical simulations .",
    "p08 suggested that :      where , @xmath75 measures the amplitude of the @xmath73 effect , @xmath76 are normalized versions of the magnetic quenching functions @xmath77 given in p08 .",
    "they are defined as follows , @xmath78 . the last term in eq.([eq : delta ] ) is the nonlinear contribution to the @xmath73-effect .",
    "its structure is the same as for the @xmath11 effect because the associated electromotive force is proportional to @xmath79 ( see details in p08 ) .",
    "thus this effect works similar to the @xmath11 effect that is excited by the nonlinear buoyant instability of large - scale magnetic field .",
    "the functions @xmath80 in eqs([eq : diff ] ) depend on the coriolis number .",
    "they can be found in p08 ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "the mixing - length is defined as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the inverse pressure variation height , and @xmath83 .",
    "the turbulent diffusivity is parameterized in the form , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the characteristic mixing - length turbulent diffusivity , @xmath86 is the typical correlation length of the turbulence , @xmath87 is a constant to control the efficiency of large - scale magnetic field dragging by the turbulent flow .",
    "also , we modify the mixing - length turbulent diffusivity by factor @xmath88 , @xmath89 to get the saturation of the turbulent parameters to the bottom of the convection zone . the latter is suggested by the numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "the results do not change very much if we apply @xmath90 with @xmath91 . for the greater @xmath92 we get the steady non - oscillating dynamo which is concentrated to the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "the purpose to introduce the additional parameters like @xmath93 and @xmath94 is to get the distribution of the @xmath11 effect closer to the result obtained in the numerical simulations .",
    "the bottom of the integration domain is @xmath95 and the top of the integration domain is @xmath96 .",
    "the choice of parameters in the dynamo is justified by our previous studies @xcite , where it has been shown that solar - types dynamos can be obtained for @xmath97 . in those papers we find an approximate threshold @xmath98 for a given value of diffusivity dilution factor @xmath99 .",
