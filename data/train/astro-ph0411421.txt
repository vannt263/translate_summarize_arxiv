    "since the very first observations , ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) have been an open question and a priority in astroparticle physics .",
    "their origin , nature and possible acceleration mechanisms are still a mystery . in the last decades",
    "many experiments such as volcano ranch  @xcite , haverah park  @xcite , yakutsk  @xcite , fly s eye  @xcite , hires  @xcite and agasa  @xcite have contributed for the study of uhecr s , setting up the existence of such high energy particles .",
    "shorty , the pierre auger observatory will begin to explore them in unprecedented detail  @xcite .    due to the very low flux of high energy cosmic rays",
    ", measuring extensive air showers ( eas ) is the only possible technique to learn about the shape of the uhecr spectrum and their chemical composition .",
    "two different ways have been historically applied to observe and analyze eas s : ground array of detectors and optical detectors .",
    "surface detectors measure a lateral density sample and trigger in coincidence when charged particles pass through them .",
    "optical detectors ( i.e. , fluorescence detectors ) observe the longitudinal profile evolution by measuring the fluorescence light from atmospheric nitrogen excitation produced by the ionization of the secondary charged particles ( essentially electrons and positrons ) .",
    "the combination of shower observables ( such as lateral density , the depth of maximum shower development ( @xmath0 ) and number of muons ( @xmath1 ) at detector observation level ) and simulation techniques is the current way to obtain information about the primary energy , composition and arrival direction . for this purpose the shower simulation should provide all possible , and ideally the necessary , information to interpret measurements of shower parameters .",
    "we suggest the reference @xcite which is an interesting summary of experimental results from highest energy cosmic ray measurements , focused on data and analyzes that became available after 1999 .",
    "many modern shower simulation packages have been developed over the years .",
    "most of them are based on the monte carlo method and simulate complete high energy showers with well described fluctuations in the first particle interactions and realistic distributions of energy of shower particles .",
    "unfortunately , the calculation of the gigantic showers induced by cosmic rays with energies above 10@xmath2  ev becomes a very difficult technical problem .",
    "this is due to the huge number of created secondary particles that have to be followed in the monte carlo method .",
    "as a consequence the direct simulation of the shower following each individual particle becomes practically impossible and the computation time takes too long .",
    "recently , different ways of calculating the air shower development have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "most of them combine the traditional monte carlo scheme with a system of electromagnetic and hadronic cascade equations . in a new one dimensional approach",
    "@xcite pre - simulated pion - induced showers are described with parametrizations and then are superimposed to pion and kaon particles after their first interaction points are simulated by the monte carlo method .    in the present work",
    "we analyze extensively the results obtained by the seneca  @xcite code .",
    "the seneca simulation approach is based on the monte carlo calculation of the first and final stages of the air shower development , and on a cascade equation system that connects both stages reproducing the longitudinal shower development .",
    "we explore mainly the fast air shower generation for different primary energies . as an application of this approach we investigate the main longitudinal shower characteristics of proton , iron nucleus and gamma initiated air showers up to ultra - high energy , as predicted by the qgsjet  @xcite hadronic interaction model .",
    "we compare seneca results with the well tested corsika ( cosmic ray simulations for kascade ) simulation code  @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secii ] we briefly describe the hybrid approach and the air shower modelling . in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] the method is applied to study the longitudinal development and the shower observables as well .",
    "our main intention is to compare our predictions to calculations performed with the corsika shower generator , in order to verify the stability of the hybrid code and the reliability of the its results , in the sense of being useful to several experimental applications .",
    "we have made several calculations for gamma , iron nucleus and proton initiated showers with different energy thresholds , using the thinning procedure for the monte carlo simulation scheme .",
    "average and fluctuation values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , their correlations and distributions are presented .",
    "the number of electrons ( @xmath5 ) and muons ( @xmath6 ) have been analyzed at different observation levels . also , we show a comparison between corsika and seneca cpu time requirements for proton showers at different primary energies .",
    "section  [ seciv ] summarizes our results .",
    "the main goal of this approach is the generation of eas s in a fast manner , obtaining the correct description of the fluctuations in showers and giving the average values for the shower characteristics .",
    "the detailed technical information about the seneca package can be obtained in  @xcite .",
    "even though the seneca code describes both longitudinal and lateral air shower developments , the simulation scheme is used here to generate large statistics of longitudinal shower profiles applicable mainly to the present fluorescence detectors , such as pierre auger observatory  @xcite and hires  @xcite , as well to the future telescope euso  @xcite .    for the present work we track explicitly every particle with energy above the fraction @xmath7=@xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the primary shower energy , studying in detail the initial part of the shower .",
    "all secondary particles with energy below the mentioned fraction are taken as initial conditions to initialize a system of hadronic and electromagnetic cascade equations ( see the suggested references ) .",
    "we use the cascade equations up to several minimum electromagnetic energy thresholds of 1 , 3.16 , 10 , 31.6 and 100  gev for the electromagnetic component ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11=@xmath12  gev for the hadronic component .",
    "hadronic and electromagnetic particles with energies below the @xmath11 and @xmath10 are no longer treated by the cascade equations but traced again in the monte carlo scheme .",
    "the hadronic interactions at high energies are calculated with the qgsjet01  @xcite model while the interactions at low energies with gheisha  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic interactions are treated by the egs4  @xcite code .",
    "the adopted kinetic energy cutoffs for all simulations were 50  mev ( 0.3  mev ) for hadrons and muons ( electrons and positrons ) .",
    "the forementioned energy thresholds were chosen in order to verify qualitatively the dependence and performance of the cascade results , trying to minimize the cpu time without the introduction of significant errors .",
    "all seneca simulations were performed with 1.2.2 . version .",
    "in this session we apply the seneca simulation approach to generate gamma , iron nucleus and proton induced air showers at fixed primary energies and explore the longitudinal development .",
    "although the simulation of showers at fixed energies is not a very realistic application we intend in the present work to compare quantitatively seneca and corsika results .",
    "one important reason for this comparison is to optimize the compromise between simulation time usage and accuracy in the description of fluctuations . in this particular case",
    ", such detailed study can be useful to many experiments which use the fluorescence technique .    in fig .",
    "[ long_sen ] we illustrate individual longitudinal profiles generated by seneca ( hybrid approach ) code .",
    "displayed cases correspond to median longitudinal profile produced for 1,000 gamma ( dashed ) , iron nucleus ( dot - dashed ) and proton ( solid ) induced showers at 10@xmath13  ev , at zenith angle @xmath14=@xmath15 and free first interaction point .",

    "it is possible to see a very reasonable agreement among the several longitudinal profiles . in spite of that",
    ", we can verify that corsika produces , apparently , more fluctuations related to individual proton and gamma air showers developments .",
    "all simulations performed by the corsika code were obtained by using the thinning factor @xmath16=10@xmath17 and the same energy threshold of seneca simulations , 0.3  mev ( 50  mev ) for photons and electrons ( hadrons and muons ) .",

    "we compare the hybrid results ( solid line ) to the results obtained with corsika ( dashed line ) .",
    "the expected fluctuations due to very first proton interactions are reflected on panel ( a ) and ( b ) , producing a difference of @xmath21  4% and @xmath21  3% between the distribution mean values .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) show discrepancies for the mean values of about 7% and 6% .",
    "in contrast to this , the discrepancies basically disapear at panels ( e ) and ( f ) , both obtaining an agreement of about 99.5% . in all found discrepancies , seneca produces more particles than corsika . according to @xcite ,",
    "some discrepancies are expected in the values produced for some shower quantities by the hybrid scheme and , apparently , are due to the combination of the used binning of discrete energy in the numerical solutions and the minimum energy threshold used for the electromagnetic cascade equations .",
    "such differences between the results of both codes at the first stages of the eas development should not be crucial since depths around and after the shower maximum are the most important ones for all fluorescence experiments .",

    "such primary particles have been chosen due to the different shower development in the atmosphere .",
    "the simulation development for gamma - induced showers deals mostly with the electromagnetic processes while the simulation development for proton ( or any other hadron ) showers deals with hadronic and electromagnetic processes .",
    "in other words , we are going to have different request of the cascade equation system for proton and gamma primary particles in the hybrid simulation .",
    "for the test with protons , 500 showers were generated of primary energy 10@xmath13  ev , with incident zenith angle of 45@xmath19 , calculated with the hybrid method using 30 , 40 and 50 bins ( 10 bins ) in the numerical solutions of electromagnetic ( hadronic ) cascades , and different minimum energy thresholds for the electromagnetic cascade equations @xmath10=  1 , 10 and 100  gev .",

    "in the present work we analyzed the practical potential of seneca , a very fast hybrid tri - dimensional code , for the simulation of the longitudinal development of extensive air showers at high energies . we take as reference the well known and extensively tested corsika code , which is based on a much slower , but highly reliable , full monte carlo simulation .",
    "the qgsjet01 hadronic interaction model is used throughout the paper for both codes .",
    "although a careful analysis of many shower quantities discussed here is strongly model dependent , we are confident that the present study is able to show the potential and limitations of seneca , in its present version , for a practical application to the analysis of fluorescence data on ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "the consistency of the seneca scheme was tested and it proved to be very stable for energies above @xmath23 ev .",
    "the results obtained by both codes agree well with negligible discrepancies for most quantities analyzed .",
    "apparently , minimum electromagnetic energy threshold values of 10 and 100  gev may produce artificial fluctuations on @xmath4 shower quantity .",
    "these could be responsible for the introduction of systematic errors on the analysis of isolated events and should be taken into account when applying seneca to fluorescence reconstruction .    in any case , the undisputable bounty of seneca is velocity .",
    "the rates of processing time - consumption between corsika and seneca are , to say the least , impressive over the wide range of primary shower energy tested here .    finally , as a word of caution , special attention",
    "must be paid to the selection of the several input parameters of seneca in practical applications , since they may affect the results in a non - trivial and somehow unpredictable way .    *",
