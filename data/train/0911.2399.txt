    "the @xmath0 decays play a very important role in heavy flavor physics . at the quark level , these decays involve the flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) of the @xmath6 transition , which is a purely quantum loop - mediated effect in the standard model ( sm ) . therefore , these decay modes have been proposed to test the sm predictions @xcite .",
    "in addition to the branching ratio , several observables of the @xmath2 decay , such as the longitudinal polarization fraction , the forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath7 ) , the isospin symmetry , and the transverse asymmetry , have been proposed to probe possible new physics ( np ) @xcite .",
