    "one area extensively studied in the last twenty years is the phenomenon of chaotic advection @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon results from the chaotic nature of lagrangian trajectories and enhances the mixing of tracers in laminar flows . indeed in its absence the mixing relies on the less efficient molecular diffusion .",
    "hence , its applications are important in geophysical flows where advected quantities vary from the ozone in the stratosphere to various pollutants in the atmosphere and ocean , or such scalar quantities as temperature or salinity .",
    "this growing interest in geophysical flows increases the relevance of two - dimensional models and more specifically the problem of advection in a system with many vortices @xcite-@xcite .",
    "moreover , different observations and numerous models have shown that the transport of advected particles is anomalous and can be linked to the levy - type processes and their generalizations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "another peculiarity of two - dimensional worlds is the presence of the inverse energy cascade in turbulent flows , which results in the emergence of coherent vortices , dominating the flow dynamics @xcite-@xcite .    in order to tackle this problem and especially the anomalous features ,",
    "our approach has been gradual and the present work completes a series of papers @xcite-@xcite , which consists of gradual successive steps of dynamical investigations of transport in two - dimensional flows .",
    "we restricted ourselves to a relatively simple model , and performed a thorough analysis of the dynamics of tracers .",
    "this approach allows to infer some properties of the kinetics which actually govern transport . to settle for a model , we recall that systems point vortices have been used to mimic the dynamics of finite - sized vortices @xcite-@xcite , and",
    "mention that the evolution of @xmath3 turbulence after the emergence of the vortices has been successfully described by punctuated hamiltonian models @xcite .",
    "moreover , noisy point vortex dynamics have been recently used to describe exact unstationnary two - dimensional solution of the navier - stockes equation @xcite . therefore",
    ", despite their relative simplicity , it was clear that systems of point vortices managed to capture some of the essential features of two - dimensional flows , it therefore seemed natural to consider these systems as the basis for our investigations .    in the following",
    "we investigate the dynamics as well as the advection properties of point vortex systems , more specifically we address the problem with 3 point vortices as well as systems of 4 and 16 vortices .",
    "a system of three point - vortices is integrable and often generate periodic flows ( in co - rotating reference frame)@xcite-@xcite .",
    "we then can investigate the phase space of passive tracers with poincar maps . a well - defined stochastic sea filled with islands of regular motion",
    "is observed , among these are special islands known as `` vortex cores '' surrounding each of the vortices .",
    "the non - uniformity of the phase space and the presence of islands of regular motion within the stochastic sea has a considerable impact on the transport properties of such systems .",
    "the phenomenon of stickiness on the boundaries of the islands generates strong `` memory effects '' and transport is found to be anomalous . on the other hand , the motion of @xmath4 point vortices on the plane is generically chaotic for @xmath5 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the periodicity is lost when considering a system of four vortices or more , but snapshots of the system have revealed the cores surrounding vortices are a robust feature @xcite-@xcite , the actual accessible phase space is in this sense non uniform and stickiness around these cores has been observed @xcite . in fact , a refined analysis has revealed that in systems of 4 vortices and more the cores are surrounded by coherent jets , within which little dispersion occurs and thus which give rise to anomalous transport properties @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to propose a unified view of transport properties in these system of vortices . in sec .",
    "[ sec : point - vortex - and - passive ] , we start to recall briefly the general equations governing dynamics of point vortices as well as passive tracers .",
    "we then describe with more details the motion of vortices and tracers for some specific cases .",
    "we start with integrable systems of vortices namely , a system with three identical vortices , and a system of with two identical vortices and one of the opposite sign , a system which allows to set up parameters in order to set the motion of the vortices on a collapse course .",
    "we then consider a system of four and sixteen identical vortices . in sec .",
    "[ sec : transport - properties ] we investigate the transport properties of advected particles in these systems and measure the typical transport exponent , finally in sec .  [ sec : fractional - aspects - of ] we develop on the fractional aspects of transport and link its anomalous features to the fractal nature of the topology of the flow .",
    "systems of point vortices are exact solutions of the two - dimensional euler equation@xmath6 & = & 0\\label{euler}\\\\ \\delta \\psi   & = & \\omega \\ : , \\label{poisson}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the vorticity and @xmath8 is the stream function .",
    "the vortices describe the dynamics of the singular distribution of vorticity @xmath9 where @xmath10 locates a position in the complex plane , @xmath11 is the complex coordinate of the vortex @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is its strength , in an ideal incompressible two - dimensional fluid .",
    "this system can be described by a hamiltonian of @xmath4 interacting particles ( see for instance @xcite ) , referred to as a system of @xmath4 point vortices . the system s evolution writes@xmath14 where the couple @xmath15 are the conjugate variables of the hamiltonian @xmath16 .",
    "the nature of the interaction depends on the geometry of the domain occupied by fluid . for the case of an unbounded plane , the resulting complex velocity field @xmath17 at position @xmath10 and time",
    "@xmath18 is given by the sum of the individual vortex contributions:@xmath19 and the hamiltonian becomes@xmath20 the translational and rotational invariance of the hamiltonian @xmath16 provides for the motion equations ( [ vortex.eq ] ) three other conserved quantities , besides the energy , @xmath21 among the different integrals of motion , there are three independent first integrals in involution : @xmath16 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; consequently the motion of three vortices on the infinite plane is always integrable and chaos arises when @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of a passive tracer is given by the advection equation@xmath24 where @xmath25 represent the position of the tracer at time @xmath18 , and @xmath17 is the velocity field ( [ velocity ] ) . for a point vortex system ,",
    "the velocity field is given by eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) , and equation ( [ gen.adv ] ) can be rewritten in a hamiltonian form : @xmath26 where the stream function @xmath27 acts as a hamiltonian .",
    "the stream function depends on time through the vortex coordinates @xmath28 , implying a non - autonomous system .    due to chaotic nature of the evolutions we rely heavily on numerical simulations .",
    "the trajectories of the vortices as well as those of the passive tracers are integrated numerically using the symplectic scheme described in @xcite and which has already been successfully used in @xcite .",
    "a general classification of different types of three vortex motion , as well as studies of special cases were addressed by many authors @xcite . among the different possibilities",
    "quasiperiodic motion of the vortices is found generically for solutions for which the motion of the vortices is bound within a finite domain .",
    "we consider two different type systems . on one hand",
    "we consider a system with three identical vortices ( see @xcite ) , in this setting the two extreme regimes for the advection pattern of strong and weak chaos can be investigated with good control and analytical expression of vortex core is given .",
    "on the other hand in order to stress our results we consider also 3-vortex systems in the vicinity of a configuration leading to finite time singular solution . indeed",
    "three vortices can be brought to a single point in finite time by their mutual interaction .",
    "aref @xcite points out that this result was already known to grbli more than a century ago .",
    "this phenomenon , known as _ point - vortex collapse _ was studied in @xcite .",
    "thus , under certain conditions , which depends both on the initial conditions , and the vortex strengths , the motion is self similar , leading either to the collapse of the three vortices in a finite time , or by time reversal , to an infinite expansion of the triangle formed by the vortices .",
    "let us re - derive these conditions of a collapse or an infinite expansion .",
    "for a system of three vortices in an unbounded domain , the invariance of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonianvortex ] ) under translations allows a free choice of the coordinate origin , which we put to the center of vorticity ( when it exists ) , the angular momentum in a frame independent form is then rewritten as:@xmath29\\label{eq : k}\\\\   & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\sum _ { i\\ne j}k_{i}k_{j}|z_{i}-z_{j}|^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the first condition is immediate as for a collapse to occur the frame independent angular momentum ( [ eq : k ] ) has to vanish . for the second condition",
    "we look for conditions resulting in a scale invariant hamiltonian . with such spirit",
    "let us divide all lengths by a common factor @xmath30 in the hamiltonian @xmath16 .",
    "we readily obtain @xmath31 , we then obtain the collapse conditions:@xmath32 _ i.e _ , the total angular momentum in its frame free form and the harmonic mean of the vortex strengths are both zero ( [ eq : collapse - condition ] ) . near a collapse configuration , the two conditions ( [ eq : collapse - condition ] ) allow two different ways to approach the singularity .",
    "namely , we can change initial conditions which changes the value of @xmath33 , or change the vortex strength and modify the harmonic mean .",
    "these lead to different types of motion which have been classified and studied in @xcite .    in all considered cases ,",
    "the relative vortex motion is periodic , i.e. the vortex triangle repeats its shape after a time @xmath34 .",
    "this does not imply a periodicity of the absolute motion , since the triangle is rotated by some angle @xmath35 during this time .",
    "in general , @xmath35 is incommensurate with @xmath36 , rendering a quasiperiodic time dependence of @xmath37 .",
    "let us consider a reference frame , rotating around the center of vorticity with an angular velocity @xmath38 in this co - rotating reference frame , vortices return to their original positions in one period of relative motion @xmath34 , their new coordinates @xmath39 are periodic functions of time . in the co - rotating frame the advection equation retains its hamiltonian form with a new stream function @xmath40 . in this frame",
    "@xmath40 is time - periodic ( @xmath41 ) and well - developed techniques for periodically forced hamiltonian systems can be used to study its solutions @xcite .",
    "note , that the one - period rotation angle @xmath35 is defined modulo @xmath36 , making the choice of the co - rotating frame non - unique .",
    "anomalous properties of tracer advection in a flow generated by the motion of three identical vortices were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the vortices were initialized with such initial conditions creating a large region of chaotic tracer motion .",
    "the structure of the chaotic region is quite complex , with an infinite number of kam - islands ( stratified with regular trajectories ) of different shapes and sizes embedded into it . to visualize these structures , we construct poincar sections of tracer trajectories ( in the co - rotating frame ) .",
    "a poincar section is defined as an orbit of a period - one ( poincar ) map @xmath42@xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes a solution @xmath45 with an initial condition @xmath46 .",
    "plots of poincar sections for three identical vortices in the strong chaotic regime as well as for a system near a collapse configuration are shown in figure  [ cap : poincar - map ]    .",
    "we recall that vortex and tracer trajectories were computed using a symplectic gauss - legendre scheme @xcite .",
    "the exact conservation of poincar invariants by the symplectic scheme suppresses numerical diffusion , yielding high - resolution phase space portraits .",
    "the poincar sections are presented in the figure  [ cap : poincar - map ] show an intricate mixture of regions with chaotic and regular tracer dynamics , typical for periodically forced hamiltonian systems .",
    "all three phase portraits share common features with the advection patterns : the stochastic sea is bounded by a more or less circular domain , there are a islands inside it , where the tracer s motion is predominantly regular . in particular ,",
    "all three vortices are surrounded by robust near - circular islands , known as vortex cores .",
    "an expression of the radius of the cores is computed when the vortices are equal @xcite , and the minimum inter - vortex distance through time provides as well a good upper estimate of the core radii ( see for instance @xcite ) , this estimate proves also to be quantitative in a four vortex system @xcite as well as in 16-vortex systems@xcite .",
    "due to the generic chaotic nature of 4-point vortex system , understanding the vortex motion necessitates a different approach than for integrable 3-vortex systems . for identical vortices",
    "it is possible to perform a canonical transformation of the vortex coordinates @xcite . for a 4-vortex system ,",
    "this transformation results in an effective system with @xmath47 degrees of freedom , providing a conceptually easier framework in which perform well defined two - dimensional poincar sections can be performed @xcite . to summarize the results obtained in @xcite ,",
    "the motion is in general chaotic , except for some special initial conditions , for instance when the vortices are forming a square the motion is periodic and the vortices rotate on a circle , then symmetric deformation ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) of the square lead to quasiperiodic motion ( periodic motion in a given rotating frame ) .    as a prerequisite to our investigations on the advection of passive tracers ,",
    "a basic understanding of the vortex subsystem behavior is necessary .",
    "for this matter , an arbitrary initial condition of the 4-vortex system is chosen , although the poincar section is computed and the desired generic chaotic behavior verified @xcite . as we evolve from the 4 vortex system to 16 vortices the phase space dimension is considerably increased and due to the long range interaction between vortices ( see the hamiltonian [ hamiltonianvortex ] ) the energy does not behave as an extensive variable .",
    "thus , in order to keep some coherence between the four vortex system and the sixteen vortex one , we chose to keep the average area occupied by each vortex approximatively constant .",
    "the switch from 4 to 16 vortices can then be thought of as increasing the domain with non - zero vorticity while keeping the vorticity `` uniform '' within the patch .",
    "the initial condition is chosen randomly within a disk and there is no vortices with close neighborhood to avoid any possible forced pairing .",
    "after that all position are rescaled to match the condition of uniform vorticity .",
    "we shall now consider some specific behavior of these chaotic dynamics , namely the phenomenon of vortex pairing .",
    "the simulations performed in @xcite indicate that long time vortex pairing exists , in fact the formation of long - lived triplet ( a system of @xmath50 bound vortices ) is also observed @xcite , and thus the relevance of three vortex systems is confirmed .",
    "in fact , the formation of triplets or pair of vortices concentrates vorticity in small regions of the plane and in some sense is reminiscent of what is observed in 2d turbulence .",
    "however , since no quadruples ( or even larger clusters ) are observed , we may speculate that this concentration of vorticity is intimately linked to the dynamics and long memory effects associated with stickiness .",
    "indeed this phenomenon can be thought as sticking phenomenon to an object of lesser dimension than the actual phase space with some constraints : the object is reached by generating subsystems ( 2 and 3 vortex systems ) whose integrability is a good approximate for a fairly long time . for comparison",
    "we mention that a typical time of an eddy turnover used in @xcite , corresponds to a time of order @xmath51 in these systems while triplets and pairing are typical times are at least 2 orders of magnitude larger .",
    "we have now a sufficient knowledge of the dynamics of the chaotic vortex systems , and move on to the behavior of passive tracers generated by these flows .    for the system of 4 point vortices",
    ", successive snapshots have shown that passive tracers can stick on the boundaries of cores and jump from one core to another core during a pairing or escape from the core due to perturbations    .",
    "the fact that a tracer is able to escape from a core means that the surrounding regions of the cores are connected to the region of strong chaos .",
    "the results presented in @xcite indicate that these regions mix poorly with the region of strong chaos .",
    "one way to track this phenomenon is to use finite - time lyapunov exponents ( ftle ) and to eliminate domains of small values of the ftle @xcite .",
    "once these exponents are measured from tracers trajectories whose initial conditions are covering the plane , a scalar field distributed within the space of initial conditions is obtained and the two dimensional plot of the scalar field reveals regions of vanishing ftle , namely the cores surrounding the vortices and the far field region .",
    "the cores are thus regions of small ftle , meaning that two nearby trajectories are bound together for long times , and this despite the core s chaotic motion .",
    "these properties reveal typically a sharp change of the tracers dynamics as it crosses from the region of strong chaos to the core .",
    "in general the deterministic description of the motion of a passive particle in the chaotic region is impossible , a local instability produces exponential divergence of trajectories .",
    "even the outcome of an idealized numerical experiment is non - deterministic , indeed in this situation round - off errors are creeping slowly but steadily from the smallest to the observable scale .",
    "the long - time behavior of tracer trajectories in the mixing region is therefore studied using a probabilistic approach . in the absence of long - term correlations ,",
    "a kinetic description , which uses the fokker - plank - kolmogorov equation and leads to gaussian statistics , @xcite works fairly well for many situations . yet in the present case , the topology of the advection pattern ( fig .",
    "[ cap : poincar - map ] ) and the trapping of tracers in the neighborhood of cores ( see fig .",
    "[ coreexchange ] ) indicate that anomalous statistical properties of the tracers should be expected .",
    "the singular zones around kam islands and the cores give often rise to a stickiness phenomenon and produce long - time correlations , which result in profound changes in the kinetics . in some cases",
    "these `` memory effects '' can be accounted for by the modification of the diffusion coefficient in the fpk equation @xcite , but often their influence is more profound @xcite , and leads to a super - diffusive behavior with faster than linear growth of the particle displacement variance : @xmath52 the transport exponent @xmath1 exceeds the gaussian value : @xmath53 .    for all considered case",
    ", the vortices are moving within a finite domain .",
    "it is thus important to define what quantities will be measured to characterize the transport properties of the system .",
    "there has been evidence in @xcite of radial diffusion , but the diffusion coefficient @xmath54 is vanishing as @xmath55 with typical behavior @xmath56 . in the case of more than four vortices",
    "we can still expect a similar type of behavior .",
    "however the region far from the vortices is of little interest when one want to address the transport properties of typical geophysical flows and the most relevant is the region being accessible to the vortices also called the region of `` strong chaos '' . in the 3-vortex systems the question is even more crucial as the accessible domain of tracers ( the chaotic sea ) reduces to a finite region surrounded by a kam curve .",
    "one way around this finite domain problem is to focus our interest on the character of tracer rotation , and for that matter , we define its azimuthal coordinate in the center of vorticity reference frame @xmath57 to be a continuous function of time , i.e. @xmath58 keeps track of the number of revolutions performed by a tracer .",
    "however for many vortices we choose another quantity , namely we consider tracer transport by measuring the arclength @xmath59 of the path traveled by an individual tracer up to a time @xmath18 .",
    "the arclength @xmath59 writes@xmath60 where @xmath61 is the absolute speed of the particle @xmath62 at time @xmath63 .",
    "the main advantage of this quantity is that it is independent of the coordinate system and as such we can expect to infer intrinsic properties of the dynamics .",
    "the main observable characteristics will be moments of the angle @xmath64 or distance @xmath59:@xmath65 where @xmath62 corresponds either to the i - th vortex or a tracer in the field of 3 , 4 or 16 vortices and @xmath66 stands for @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "the averaging operator @xmath69 needs a special comment . expecting anomalous transport one should be ready to have infinite moments starting from @xmath70 . to avoid any difficulty with infinite moments we consider truncated distribution function , which was discussed in details in @xcite and allows to satisfy the physical restriction of a finite velocity and and the finite time of our simulations .",
    "this condition actually put some constraints on the maximum meaningful value @xmath71 of @xmath72 , and beyond @xmath71 the moments are basically monitoring the population of almost ballistic trajectories .",
    "up to the mentioned constraints , we will always consider the operation of averaging to be performed over truncated distributions . in this perspective",
    "all moments are finite and one can expect@xmath73 with , generally , @xmath74 as is expected from normal diffusion . the nonlinear dependence of @xmath75 is a signature of the multifractality of the transport , . for more information on the appearance of multi - fractal kinetics and related transport",
    "see @xcite .",
    "some authors use the notion of weak ( @xmath76 ) and strong ( @xmath77 ) anomalous diffusion @xcite or strong and weak self - similarity @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , two types of anomalous diffusion were distinguished by the behavior of the moments , and the notion of weak and strong anomalous diffusion @xcite or identically strong and weak self - similarity @xcite introduced .",
    "when the evolution of all of the moments can be described by a single self - similarity exponent @xmath78 according to @xmath79 refers to `` weak anomalous diffusion '' , whereas the case when @xmath78 in ( [ eq : weak ] ) is not constant , i.e. @xmath80 is named `` strong anomalous diffusion '' .",
    "this distinction is important since in the weak case the pdf must evolve in a self - similar way : @xmath81 whereas non - constant @xmath82 in ( [ eq : strong ] ) precludes such self - similarity ( see also the discussions in @xcite for details about the non self - similar behavior ) .    in all our simulations , the results show that the transport of tracers in point - vortex systems is strongly anomalous and super - diffusive , hence to avoid redundancy we graphically only present the transport properties of passive tracers obtained for a 3-point vortex flow in fig .",
    "[ cap : the - exponent ] .",
    "the behavior for the other considered systems is very similar , namely our results show , that for all considered systems @xmath75 is well approximated by a piecewise linear function of the form : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a constant , and @xmath71 is the crossover moment number .    even though we only considered few different initial condition for the different vortex system",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that the transport properties obtained for such systems are fairly general since all give the same kind anomalous behavior with a transport exponent more or less around @xmath85 .",
    "the origin of the anomalous transport properties can be linked back to the intermittent character of tracer motion .",
    "this phenomenon is characterized by an anomalous distribution of recurrences of the poincar map of tracer trajectories for the three vortex systems , or the algebraic decay of the density of trapping time within jets in many vortex systems . to define recurrences , we take a region @xmath86 in the chaotic sea , and register all returns of a poincar map trajectory into @xmath86 .",
    "the length of a recurrence is a time interval between two successive returns .",
    "the distribution of the recurrence times does not depend on the choice of the trajectory in the chaotic region , in dynamical systems with perfect mixing this distribution is poissonian but the hamiltonian systems with coexisting regular and chaotic motions exhibit a power - law tails in the distribution .",
    "recurrence distributions for tracers in three vortex systems show that all distributions have long tails , indicating , that between the returns tracers are being trapped in long flights of highly correlated motion .",
    "long recurrences are distributed according to a power law @xmath87 the measured values of the exponent @xmath88 in refs.@xcite are all around : @xmath89    the value of the decay exponent @xmath88 does not depend on the choice of the domain @xmath86 as long as it is taken in the well - mixed region , away from the kam - islands .    in order to establish the origin of the long recurrences the corresponding poincare cycles ( i.e. parts of the map orbit between the returns )",
    "are plotted color - coded by the recurrence times @xmath90 , see fig .",
    "[ cap:3vortfrac ] ( only the cycles with @xmath91 are shown ) .",
    "the orbits of the long cycles are concentrated at the boundaries of the chaotic sea , around the islands of regular motion and at the external boundary .",
    "the longest recurrences ( shown in red ) correspond to the trajectories that penetrate deeply into the hierarchical island - around - island structures , see fig .",
    "[ cap:3vortfrac ] .",
    "this phenomenon , known as stickiness ( of kam island boundaries ) introduces long correlations to the tracer motion and leads to anomalous kinetic properties of chaotic trajectories .",
    "another way to characterize this stickiness phenomenon using distribution of time averaged speed has been used in @xcite , typically each sticky zone corresponds to a special time averaged speed different than the whole phase space average , hence sticky portions of particles trajectories can be identified ( see fig .",
    "[ cap:3vortfrac ] ) .",
    "when dealing with more than three vortices the chaotic nature of the vortex systems does not allow to use the poincar map .",
    "however we can circumvent this problem by actually noticing that when dealing with more practical situations , we are facing a `` coarse grained '' phase space , and each point is actually a ball from which infinitely many real trajectories can depart .",
    "given this fact",
    "we can imagine that two nearby real trajectories diverge exponentially for a while but then get closer again without actually going to far from each other , a process which may happen over and over in the case of stickiness observed around islands in three vortex systems . from the `` coarse grained '' perspective those two real trajectories are identical .",
    "we then can infer that there exists bunch of nearby trajectories which may remain within a given neighborhood for a given time , giving rise to what is commonly called a _ jet _",
    "note that the stickiness to a randomly moving and not well determined in phase space coherent structure imposes existence of jets , while the opposite may not be the case .    to actually measure the jets properties of the system , we use the following strategy .",
    "let us consider a given trajectory @xmath92 evolving within the phase space .",
    "for each instant @xmath18 , we consider a ball @xmath93 of radius @xmath94 centered on our reference trajectory .",
    "we then start a number of trajectories within the ball at a given time , and measure the time it actually takes them to escape the ball , and have then access to trapping time distribution which is plotted for a system driven by four vortices in fig .",
    "[ figescapetime4vortex ] and log - log plot clearly shows the power - law decay of the trapping times , with typical exponent @xmath95 .      given the trapping time distribution it is possible to compute a distribution of finite - time lyapunov exponent ( see @xcite ) , which identifies a threshold @xmath96 and allows to dynamically detect a jet .",
    "two different types of jets are identified , namely slow jets evolving in the region far from the vortices as well as fast jets localized on the boundaries of vortex cores .",
    "these last jets are profoundly influenced by the phenomenon of vortex pairing , and this phenomenon is at the origin of some mixing as it actually leads to the division and merging jets ( see fig .",
    "[ coreexchange ] ) .",
    "this localization of the jets confirms the results already illustrated in fig .",
    "[ coreexchange ] that the boundaries of the core exhibit the stickiness .",
    "however we insist on the fact that the stickiness of the system has been confirmed by looking for jets . in this sense",
    "the method used is rather general , and could be applied to other hamiltonian systems .",
    "we now focus on the inner structure of the jet , a first plot of the evolution of a relative position of a tracer with respect to another tracer s position while both are within a jet . a plot of such structure is presented in fig .",
    "[ figslowjet ] , where we discover a fine structure formed by a hierarchy of circular ( tubular ) jets within jets .",
    "this last structure found for a 4-vortex system , we also looked at a jet in a system of sixteen vortices .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig16vjettime ] , where the relative position of the ghost ( relative tracer ) is colored differently for different time periods of the life of the jet .",
    "we can see that effectively the nested set of jets within jets remains , and that the ghosts is also spiraling back and forth in between .",
    "we also see the ghost going back very close to the tracer .",
    "this hierarchical structure is also reminiscent of the discrete renormalization group , and we speculate that log - periodic oscillation described in @xcite should be observed .      in some of the previous publications ( see , for example , @xcite ) it was clearly indicated that the properties of anomalous transport are sensitive to phase space topology .",
    "more specifically , if we use the fractional kinetic equation @xcite in the form @xmath97 to describe distributions @xmath98 of rotations over angle @xmath68 , then the transport coefficient @xmath99 and exponents @xmath100 depend on the presence of different structures such as boundaries of the domain , islands , cantori , etc .",
    "the caption [ cap:3vortfrac ] shows that stickiness of trajectories to specific structures occurs with a filamentation of sticky domains along stable / unstable manifolds .",
    "in fact , different sticky domains generate different intermittent scenarios with some associated values of @xmath100 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the real kinetics is multi - fractional and can be characterized by a set of values of @xmath100 or , more precisely , by a spectral function of @xmath100 in the same sense as the spectral function for multi - fractals @xcite .",
    "the figure [ cap:3vortfrac ] characterizes the fact that trajectories , sticking to different structures ( islands ) , have different angular velocities . due to this",
    ", different asymptotic to the distribution function @xmath98 and different values of @xmath100 will appear for different time intervals .",
    "in other words , for a considered time interval one can expect a specific `` intermediate asymptotic '' for @xmath98 and , correspondingly , different pairs @xmath100 .",
    "different classes of universality for the values @xmath100 were discussed in @xcite .",
    "we will now remind the consequences of some of these results .    multiplying ( [ eq:5.1 ] ) by @xmath101 and integrating it over @xmath102",
    "we obtain @xmath103 or , in the case of self - similarity the transport exponent @xmath1 from the equation @xmath104 can be estimated as @xmath105 expression ( [ equ5.3 ] ) should be considered with some reservations since the second and higher moment may diverge .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that under special conditions the exponent @xmath88 for the trapping time asymptotic distribution @xmath106 can be linked to fractal time dimension .",
    "moreover , @xmath88 is related to the kinetic equation ( [ eq:5.1 ] ) as @xcite@xmath107    for the spatial distribution of particles , the simplest situation occurs when the diffusion process is gaussian for which @xmath108 . when a hierarchical set of islands is present , @xmath12 can be defined through scaling properties of the island areas . in the considered situation",
    "the random walk is more or less uniform in the regions where trajectories are entangled near stable / unstable manifolds .",
    "that means that we should expect that the value @xmath109 provides a good estimate .",
    "finally , we arrive to : @xmath110 this last result is confirmed by all our observations for the different vortex systems studied in @xcite .",
    "we need to comment that it is not worthwhile to try to obtain @xmath1 with a high accuracy since a specific value of @xmath1 has no meaning due to multi - fractal nature of transport @xcite .",
    "in fact , we can be even more precise , as the exponent @xmath88 can be estimated to @xmath111 leading to @xmath112 , which is a good approximation of the different observed values given the multifractality of the transport .",
    "we shall not reproduce here the estimation of @xmath88 ( see for instance @xcite for details ) , but the idea revolves around the presence of an island of stability leading to ballistic or accelerator modes within the island .",
    "in this paper the dynamical and statistical properties of the passive particle advection in flows generated by three , four and sixteen point vortices has been reviewed .",
    "the goal of this work was to provide qualitative insights on general transport properties of two - dimensional flows , more specifically geophysical ones , imposed by the topology of the phase space .",
    "the system of 16 vortices can be considered as a fairly large system while the 3-vortex one is the minimal one with non fixed distances between the vortices .",
    "strong vortex - vortex correlation are observed .",
    "these correlations manifest themselves the formation of long lived pairs of vortices , triplets .",
    "since these structures are integrable , we can speculate that this form of stickiness occurs by forming quasi - integrable subsets .",
    "the transport of passive tracers is found to be anomalous and super - diffusive in all investigated situation with a characteristic transport exponent @xmath112 .",
    "this phenomenon is explained by the existence of coherent jets , which are located in the sticky regions .",
    "these jets and sticky region exhibit a complex fractal structures in figs [ cap:3vortfrac ] , [ figslowjet ] and [ fig16vjettime ] , and are responsible for the anomalous behavior .",
    "indeed hence the power law behavior observed in fig .",
    "[ figescapetime4vortex ] characterize the exponent @xmath88 for trapping time , and the similarly power - law tails have been observed for poincar recurrence times distribution in three vortex systems @xcite . in all situation",
    "we observe an exceptional agreement with the @xmath113 relation resulting from the kinetic analysis performed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fractional - aspects - of ] .",
    "hence since the notion of jet is quite general , we can say that the anomalous diffusion finds its origin in the existence of jets typically found around coherent structures ( islands and cores ) .",
    "moreover we can access the transport properties of the global flow by simply gathering escape time data from these coherent jets and using the equation ( [ eq:5.17 ] ) resulting from the fractional kinetic equation ( [ eq:5.1 ] ) .",
    "we therefore emphasize that the present work by analyzing the role played in transport by the different fractal structures involved in our model - flows and by explicitly giving a typical value of the second moment exponent as well as the trapping time exponent should be of interest for the analysis of more realistic and complicated systems involving many vortices and coherent structures such as geophysical fluid dynamics .",
