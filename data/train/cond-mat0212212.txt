    "the motivations to study the sinai model @xcite have two origins . on one hand , the sinai model represents a ` toy ' disordered system , in which many properties that exist in more complex systems can be studied exactly , such as for instance aging behaviors @xcite , persistence exponents @xcite , the decoupling of the dynamics into fast degrees of freedom which rapidly reach local equilibrium and a slow non - equilibrium part governed by metastable states @xcite , and some chaos and rejuvenation effects @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the sinai model directly appears in various specific systems , ranging from the dynamics of domain walls in the random field ising chain @xcite to the unzipping transition in dna @xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting to obtain exact detailed informations for various observables in the sinai model .",
    "one of the most important property of the symmetric sinai diffusion is the following localization phenomenon discovered by golosov @xcite : all the thermal trajectories starting from the same initial condition in the same sample remain within a finite distance of each other even in the limit of infinite time ! in particular , in a given sample , for a given initial condition , the rescaled position @xmath11 is _ deterministic _ , and it is only after averaging over the samples that @xmath12 is distributed with the kesten distribution @xcite .",
    "the physical picture is that the particle is at time @xmath13 near the bottom of the deepest valley it has been able to reach .",
    "this is why the real space renormalization group method , first introduced in the field of random quantum spin chains @xcite , is so well suited to study the symmetric sinai diffusion @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , we have studied in more details the localization properties , by computing the infinite time limit of the localization parameters , which represent the disorder - averages of the probabilities that @xmath10 independent particles in the same sample starting from the same initial condition are at the same place at time @xmath13 and of the correlation function @xmath14 , which represents the disorder - average of the probability that two independent particles in the same sample starting from the same initial condition are at a distance @xmath15 from each other at time @xmath13 .",
    "we have moreover shown @xcite that the the infinite time limit of the localization parameters and of the correlation function exactly coincide with the corresponding equilibrium observables in a brownian potential in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a natural question is thus : do some of these localization properties survive in the presence of a small bias ?      the sinai model in the presence of a constant bias @xmath16 can be studied in a continuum version via the following langevin equation @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the usual thermal noise @xmath19 and where @xmath20 is a brownian random potential representing the disordered landscape @xmath21 equivalently , the model may be defined by the fokker - planck equation in a given sample @xmath22 for the probability distribution @xmath23 @xmath24 p(x , t \\vert x_0,0 ) \\label{fokkerplanck}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the biased case @xmath16 , the diffusion becomes transient , and there are dynamic phase transitions @xcite as @xmath25 grows , in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath26 for @xmath1 , the mean position of the particle presents the anomalous behavior @xcite @xmath27 whereas for @xmath28 , there is a finite velocity @xmath29 . for the anomalous diffusion phase ,",
    "the exact diffusion front is given in terms of lvy stable distributions @xcite : we refer the reader to the appendix [ levy ] for the definition and properties of these levy fronts .",
    "it has been suggested in @xcite that at large time , the physics of the sinai model with bias is actually equivalent to a simple directed trap model , defined by the master equation @xcite @xmath30 with the initial condition @xmath31 , and where the trapping times are independent random variables distributed with a law presenting the algebraic decay @xmath32 the anomalous diffusion phase @xmath1 then corresponds to the phase where the mean trapping time @xmath33 is infinite .",
    "the corresponding diffusion front is also a lvy diffusion front ( see appendix [ levy ] ) as for the biased sinai diffusion discussed above . for simplicity in the article , we choose the normalization of the algebraic tail to be @xmath34 it is clear that this choice simply amounts to a rescaling of @xmath35 .",
    "the presence of the large algebraic decay in the effective trapping time distribution ( [ lawtrap ] ) for the biased sinai diffusion may be understood from the real space renormalization approach in relation with the distribution of the barriers against the drift in the renormalized landscape at scale @xmath36 @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "the trapping time @xmath39 is then distributed with the power law ( [ lawtrap ] ) with the correspondence @xmath40 .      for the directed trap model ,",
    "the existing results on the extension of the thermal packet are twofold . on one hand ,",
    "the thermal width has been exactly computed in @xcite ( equation ( 26 ) ) @xmath41 ^ 2 } = \\frac{1}{\\gamma ( 2 \\mu ) } \\left ( \\frac { \\sin \\pi \\mu}{\\pi \\mu } \\right)^3 i(\\mu ) t^{2 \\mu }   \\label{aslangul}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integral @xmath42 of equation ( 26 ) in @xcite can be rewritten after a change of variables as @xmath43 the result ( [ aslangul ] ) shows that the the thermal packet is spread over a length of order @xmath44 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the infinite - time limit of the localization parameter for @xmath45 has been exactly in @xcite : their result ( 24 ) may be rewritten after a deformation of the contour in the complex plane as @xmath46 ^ 2 } = \\int_{-\\pi}^{+ \\pi } \\frac { d\\theta}{2 \\pi } \\",

    "how can this property coexist with the result ( [ aslangul ] ) for the thermal width ?",
    "the numerical simulations of @xcite show that for a single sample at fixed @xmath13 , the probability distribution @xmath49 is made out of a few sharp peaks that have a finite weight but that are at a distance of order @xmath44 .",
    "this explains why at the same time , there is a finite probability to find two particles at the same site even at infinite time , even if the thermal width diverges as @xmath50 at large time .",
    "the aim of this article is to provide a probabilistic description , sample by sample , of the localization properties of the directed trap model and of the sinai diffusion with bias in the anomalous diffusion phase @xmath1 .",
    "we will need to generalize the usual real space renormalization group method @xcite to allow for the spreading of the thermal packet over many renormalized valleys .",
    "indeed , in the usual rsrg method , the whole thermal packet is considered to be in the same renormalized valley at large time : this assumption is asymptotically exact in the symmetric sinai model and actually corresponds to the golosov localization @xcite discussed above ; it is also valid for the biased case but only in the double limit of vanishing bias @xmath3 and large time with the fixed parameter @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we will thus define explicit rules for the rsrg approach with multiple valleys occupancies and show that our construction allows to compute exact expansions in @xmath4 for all observables .      for the directed trap model ,",
    "we explicitly show how to recover in a unified framework the expansions up to order @xmath7 of the exact results for the observables discussed above :    * expansion in @xmath4 of the levy diffusion front for the rescaled variable @xmath52 ( see appendix [ levy ] ) @xmath53 e^{-x }   + o(\\mu^3 )    \\label{fmu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] * expansion in @xmath4 of the thermal width ( from ( [ aslangul ] ) and ( [ integralmu ] ) ) @xmath54   + o(\\mu^3 ) \\label{widthexact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] * expansion in @xmath4 of the localization parameter @xmath8 ( from ( [ y2exact ] ) ) @xmath55    these comparison with exact results show that our generalized rsrg procedure is exact order by order in @xmath4 : to compute observables at order @xmath5 , it is sufficient to consider a spreading of the thermal packet onto at most @xmath6 traps . so our description provide a description of the structure of the thermal packet sample by sample , and a full statistical characterization of the important traps at a given order in @xmath4 .",
    "we then use our procedure to derive new exact results .",
    "we obtain the expansion in @xmath4 of the localization parameter @xmath9 for arbitrary @xmath10 up to order @xmath7",

    "we obtain that the correlation function of two particles averages over the disorder reads @xmath59 where the weight of the delta pic at the origin corresponds as it should to the localization parameter @xmath8 ( [ y2exactexpansion ] ) , whereas the second part presents a scaling form of the variable @xmath60 .",

    "these particles are then distributed with the boltzmann distribution in a infinitely deep biased brownian valley , leading to @xmath76 where @xmath77 , computed in ( [ ykvalley ] ) , is the localization parameter for @xmath10 particles at equilibrium in a infinitely deep biased brownian valley .",
    "for the two - point correlation function , we obtain for the biased sinai model the two - scaling form @xmath78 where the first part represents the case where the two particles are at a finite distance of each other at infinite time , in which case their correlation @xmath79 is given by ( [ correvalley ] ) . the second part , corresponding to the cases where the two particles are in different renormalized valleys at infinite time , is exactly given by the scaling function @xmath61 ( [ correlong ] ) describing the long - range behavior in the trap model .",
    "we first study the directed trap model : the section [ maintrap ] presents the usual rsrg which yields all observables in the limit @xmath3 ; in section [ trapmu1 ] we explain the origin of the spreading of the thermal packet at first order in @xmath4 and compute observables at this order ; in section [ trapmu2 ] we study the second order @xmath7 ; in section [ hierarchie ] we explain the structure of the set of important traps at any given order @xmath5 .",
    "we then turn to the biased sinai model : in section [ sinaibias ] , we derive the quantitative mapping between the large - scale renormalized descriptions of the two models ( the biased sinai model and the directed trap model ) ; in section [ internal ] , we moreover characterize the internal structure of the ` traps ' in the biased sinai model by computing various statistical properties of infinitely biased brownian valleys .",
    "the section [ universal ] contains a discussion of the universality .",
    "finally , the section [ conclusion ] contains the conclusion , and some more technical details are given in the appendices .",
    "the real space renormalization procedure for the sinai model @xcite can be reformulated for the directed trap model as follows . at time",
    "@xmath13 , all traps with trapping time @xmath80 are decimated and replaced by a `` flat landscape '' to produce the renormalized landscape at time @xmath13 .",
    "we stress here that , contrary to the symmetric sinai diffusion , the remaining traps are just some of the initial traps , and that their trapping time have not been renormalized by the decimation of the small ones .",
    "this non - renormalization of the trapping times actually corresponds for the biased sinai landscape to the fact that barriers against the bias converge without rescaling to a fixed distribution @xcite .",
    "the usual rsrg picture for the dynamics is now very simple : the particle starting at @xmath81 in the @xmath82 trap will be at time @xmath13 in the first trap of the renormalized landscape , that is in the first trap having a trapping time bigger than @xmath13 .",
    "we will call this trap the main trap m. in the usual rsrg approach , all thermal trajectories are all in the same trap m. in particular , the probability distribution in a given sample is a delta @xmath83 and the localization is total : there are no thermal fluctuations @xmath84^{(0)}=0   \\label{thermalw0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and more generally all thermal cumulants beyond the first one vanish : the generating function of thermal cumulants ( [ gencum ] ) simply reads @xmath85    the two - particle correlation function is a delta @xmath86 and the localization parameters have their maximal value @xmath87    the corresponding averaged diffusion front is thus simply given by the distribution of the position @xmath88 of the main trap @xmath89^{n } \\int_t^{+\\infty } d\\tau q(\\tau )   \\label{front0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first part @xmath90^{n}$ ] represents the probability that the first @xmath91 traps have a trapping time @xmath80 , and where the last part represents the probability that the @xmath92 trap has a trapping time @xmath93 .",
    "so the scaling function @xmath94 describing the averaged diffusion front at large time @xmath95 is given at this order by a simple exponential @xmath96 which indeed coincides with the limit @xmath3 of the exact levy front ( see appendix [ levy ] ) .",
    "so the approximation where all particles of the same thermal packet are in the same trap is correct only in the limit of vanishing @xmath4 . for finite @xmath4",
    ", we will have to allow for a possible dispersion of the thermal packet .",
    "in fact in the limit @xmath3 we have considered that the distribution of the trapping time was infinitely broad in the following sense : all traps with @xmath80 were such that @xmath97 , whereas all traps with @xmath93 were such that @xmath98 . for finite @xmath4 , we have to take into account that these ratios are not really zero or infinite",

    "so for a potential that belongs to the universality class @xmath371 , but that is not a biased brownian at small scales , the distribution of the trapping times in the renormalized landscape at scale @xmath36 reads @xmath372 so that the quantitative mapping onto the trap model ( [ qttau ] ) is realized for the choice of the rg scale @xmath36 as a function of @xmath13 according to @xmath373\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which corresponds to the length scale @xmath374 this shows that the factor @xmath7 is universal and comes from the mean length of descending bonds in the renormalized landscape at large scale , whereas the factor @xmath375 of the biased brownian motion is not universal and comes from the probability distribution of the partition function of a biased brownian valley ( [ momentzbis ] ) .",

    "the discussion of the universality is the same as in the symmetric case @xcite .",
    "to study the anomalous diffusion phase @xmath0 of the directed trap model and of the sinai diffusion with bias , we have extended the usual rsrg method that assumes a full localization in a single valley to allow for the spreading of the thermal packet over many renormalized valleys .",

    "another physically interesting case concerns the logarithmic correlations , which give rise to a freezing transition in the dynamics @xcite as well as in the statics @xcite .    from the point of view of the rsrg method ,",
    "since the usual rsrg is asymptotically exact for infinite - disorder fixed points @xcite , the extension introduced here can be seen as a systematic expansion in the inverse disorder strength .",
    "it can therefore be used in the field of random quantum spin chains @xcite to study the griffith phases , and for the classical random field ising chain in the presence of a small magnetic external field @xcite .",
    "finally , the expansion in the important traps for the dynamical models discussed in this paper has a static counterpart , with the following differences : in the static case , the expansion parameter is the temperature @xmath382 , and the main trap @xmath99 corresponds to the absolute minimum of the random potential .",
    "we have already shown in @xcite for the toy model consisting of a brownian potential plus a quadratic potential , how the thermal cumulants at first order in @xmath382 can be explained by studying the statistical properties of the configurations presenting two nearly degenerate minima .",
