    "the region given by @xmath23 , where the killing vector @xmath24 of stationarity is spacelike , is called an ergoregion .    in general relativity , a free test particle moves along a geodesic of the spacetime .",

    "it should be noted that this energy @xmath30 is with respect to an observer at rest at infinity and is distinct from the cm energy @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , it is known that there is another conserved quantity called the carter constant , which is related to the total angular momentum . because of the existence of the conserved quantities @xmath30 , @xmath31 and the carter constant , geodesic equations are integrated to first - order differential equations .    for a particle which moves on the equatorial plane , for which the carter constant vanishes , @xmath32 and @xmath33",

    "a black hole is defined by a region from which no light ray can escape .",

    "no particle or no light ray can escape from behind the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "this can be understood that the velocity of a free - falling particle reaches the speed of light with respect to the distant observer .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the relative velocity of distant two bodies does not have any definite physical meaning in general relativity .",
    "so , if it is possible for a particle to stay at a constant radius @xmath88 near the horizon , which is analogous to a static observer in the @xmath102 plane , the relative velocity of such a particle with respect to the non - critical free - falling particle approaches the speed of light in the limit of the spacetime point to the horizon . a similar discussion in terms of the velocity relative to the zero angular momentum observer ( zamo ) is found in  @xcite .    here it would be helpful to study the difference in the behaviour of the particles orbiting near the horizon between a schwarzschild black hole and a kerr black hole and see how our explanation works .",
    "we focus on massive particles in the equatorial plane for clarity . for the schwarzschild black hole , where the event horizon is located at @xmath103",
    ", any particle can not stay in the vicinity of the horizon .",

    "the reason why high energy particle collision does not occur in the schwarzschild spacetime is that there is no circular orbit in the vicinity of the horizon , whether stable or not .",
    "any two particles near the horizon plunge into the horizon with the velocity of light with respect to a static observer and the relative velocity between the two particles can not be so large .",
    "it is the innermost circular orbit that determines the possibility of high energy particle collision in the vicinity of the horizon , although the isco is also very important on its own , which will be discussed later .",
    "for the kerr black hole , the explicit expression of the circular orbits is complicated but we can easily see whether there is the one in the vicinity of the horizon .",

    "that this power law holds and that the radiated energy due to the circularly orbiting particle is extracted from the kinetic energy of the particle , we can follow the transition from the adiabatic inspiral phase to the plunge phase continuously and semi - analytically . within this framework ,",
    "if the mass ratio of the particle to the black hole is sufficiently small and the black hole is nearly maximally rotating , very high cm energy is still attainable  @xcite      as for comment ( 2 ) , it should be noted that the black hole can be efficiently spun up by continuous mass accretion . on the other hand ,",
    "comment ( 2 ) suggests that the gravitational field generated by the particles may affect the process .",

    "the energy extraction efficiency @xmath147 is at most 137.2 % for the inverse compton scattering process , which is relatively more efficient among several important physical processes .",

    "in fact , the observational effects from high - energy collision of dark matter particles surrounding a rapidly rotating black hole have been calculated  @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that there can appear signature in the spectrum of gamma ray emission of high energy collision of dark matter particles and subsequent pair annihilation around a black hole and this signature can be distinguished by the observation of the fermi satellite  @xcite .",
    "however , consistently with the energy upper limit argument , it has been shown  @xcite that the flux directly emitted from the conventional baados - silk - west process is unmeasurably small because of strong redshift as well as greatly diminished escape fraction .",
    "this point has been subsequently acknowledged and the potential indirect observability has been discussed by other authors  @xcite .",
    "it is believed that there are strong magnetic fields around astrophysical black holes .",
    "the magnetic flux density is estimated to @xmath148 gauss around supermassive black holes and to @xmath149 gauss around stellar mass black holes .",
    "these magnetic fields are not so strong as to deform the black hole itself but strong enough to greatly affect the orbits of charged particles .",

    "if the lorentz force acts in the direction opposite to the gravitational force , the charged particle has a smaller isco radius and a higher isco velocity than the neutral particle .",
    "this can be viewed as an indirect acceleration of charged particles by the magnetic field , if we consider that a charged particle gradually shifts the radius of its circular orbit towards the isco for the charged particle by radiation reaction . for a schwarzschild black hole immersed in a uniform magnetic field ,",

    "we can separately discuss the condition for the divergence of @xmath0 leaving aside whether or not the colliding particles can reach the horizon by any physical process , e.g. , geodesic motion from the distant region or continuous energy loss due to radiation .",
    "we should refer to several works from this point of view .",
    "piran and shaham  @xcite discuss that @xmath0 can be unbounded for the collision of ingoing particle and outgoing particle with finite conserved quantities in the vicinity of the horizon even in the non - extremal kerr black hole , although such a collision is not physically well motivated . grib and pavlov  @xcite",
    "assume a near - critical particle in the vicinity of the horizon which is inside the barrier of the effective potential .",
    "although such a particle can not reach the vicinity of the horizon from a distant region through any geodesic motion , they invoke multiple scatterings .",
    "they showed that such a near - critical particle can collide with a non - critical falling particle with unbounded cm energy even around a non - extremal kerr black hole .",
    "for these collisions , no physically realistic processes are known to give particles such special initial conditions .",
    "as we have seen , kerr black holes act as the accelerators of neutral particles .",
    "in fact , the kerr - newmann family of black holes  @xcite , accelerating and rotating black holes  @xcite and sen black holes  @xcite are shown to accelerate neutral particles to arbitrarily high energy in the sense described in section ii .",
    "these are the examples of extremal rotating black holes which act as particle accelerators to unboundedly high energy if radiative reactions and self - force effects are neglected .",
    "the reissner - nordstrm black holes are inefficient in accelerating neutral particles but can act as the accelerators of charged particles to unboundedly high energy  @xcite .",
    "it is also the case for general rotating and charged black holes  @xcite .",
    "these are the examples of extremal charged black holes as the accelerators of charged particles to unboundedly high energy .",
    "zaslavskii discussed high energy particle collision around `` dirty '' black holes , which a certain class of stationary and axisymmetric black holes , including not only kerr black holes but also black holes surrounded by matter distribution and black holes in alternative theories of gravity .",
    "he showed that the situation is similar to the case of the kerr black holes .",
    "irrespective of the explicit functional form of the metric , extremal dirty black holes are shown to accelerate neutral particles  @xcite .",
    "recently , the particle acceleration scenario has been extended to higher dimensions .",
    "the myers - perry black holes , which are the higher - dimensional counterpart of the kerr black holes , are shown to act as the accelerators of neutral particles  @xcite .",
    "the universality of particle collision of unbounded cm energy in the vicinity of the horizon of extremal black holes suggests a tight link to the field instability universally seen on the horizon of the extremal black holes shown by aretakis  @xcite and others  @xcite .      at the event horizon of a black hole",
    ", the infalling velocity of the free - falling particle might be understood as the speed of light with respect to a distant static observer .",
    "we can interpret it as that the gravitational potential for such a particle is infinitely deep at the event horizon and hence photons emitted from such a particle are infinitely redshifted .",
    "we should note that gravitational redshift can be very large even in non black hole spacetimes .",
    "photons emitted from a particle in a compact region to infinity can be strongly redshifted if the gravitational potential is very deep there .",
    "we can also expect that high energy particle collision occurs in such a region  @xcite . in the absence of an event horizon",
    ", we can naturally consider collisions between ingoing and outgoing particles in such a high redshift region .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that the cm energy can be very high for such particle collisions in several non black hole spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency and visibility of the high energy particle collisions around super - spinning near - extremal kerr geometry are discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of black holes , where the collision between ingoing and outgoing particles in the vicinity of the event horizon is not physically well motivated since the event horizon is a one - way membrane .",
    "the non black hole scenario has a few possible advantages over the black hole one .",
    "it has been shown that in the system of charged spherical shells the gamma factor between two colliding shells can be arbitrarily large even if the effect of self - gravity is fully taken into account in the context of the non black hole scenario  @xcite .",
    "we can expect that high energy particle collision occurs in the vicinity of the horizon of a rapidly rotating black hole as a result of the particle acceleration in rather general situations .",
    "this phenomenon is well founded on the properties of the geometry and the geodesic orbits of the extremal and near - extremal kerr black holes . on the other hand , the acceleration to infinitely high energy is unphysical and there should exist an upper bound on the cm energy due to the finiteness of the acceleration time and probably due to the self - force of the colliding particles . although we do not identify this particle acceleration mechanism with the direct acceleration mechanism of observed cosmic rays , it can imprint some indirectly observable signatures on the spectra and/or light curves of cosmic rays , electromagnetic waves , neutrinos and gravitational waves .",
    "we have convincing evidence that the particle acceleration to arbitrarily high energy is one of the universal basic properties of extremal black holes not only in astrophysics but also in more general context .",
    "here we have seen some of the simplest examples .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that the particle acceleration is seen not only in the vicinity of the event horizon of black holes but also in the deep gravitational potential well in non black hole spacetimes .",
