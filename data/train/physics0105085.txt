    "following the enormous successes of lowering the temperature of atoms to the sub - mk regime , experimental attention is now turning to producing ultracold molecular samples .",
    "the `` first generation '' of cold molecule experiments has now demonstrated the efficient production of cold samples by a variety of techniques , including photoassociation of ultracold atoms  @xcite , counter - rotating supersonic jets  @xcite , stark slowing  @xcite , and buffer - gas cooling  @xcite .",
    "the latter two have yielded trapped samples that are cold in rotational , vibrational and translational degrees of freedom , although translational temperatures are still in the @xmath4-@xmath5 k range .",
    "the next generation of experiments will seek colder , denser samples .",
    "one novel option for cooling molecules further is the optical cooling strategy described in ref .",
    "alternatively , we consider in this paper the evaporative cooling of paramagnetic molecules in a static magnetic trap , following the strategies that have been employed to produce ultracold atoms .",
    "the central issue to the success of this method is that the rate of elastic , rethermalizing collisions far exceeds the rate of lossy inelastic collisions that produce untrapped , strong - field - seeking states . in terms of scattering rate coefficients ,",
    "this criterion is usually written @xmath6",
    ". a large ratio of @xmath7 is also vital for the stability of the trapped gas once it is cold .",
    "a main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that molecules with nonzero spin in their lowest energy state will be quite stable at ultralow temperatures .",
    "we may reasonably assert that the elastic rate constants for neutral molecules have roughly the same magnitudes as those for neutral atoms , @xmath8 @xmath9/sec at low energies , barring unfortunately placed zeros in their s - wave scattering cross sections .",
    "indeed , our calculations yield elastic rates of this magnitude .",
    "the spin- state- changing rate constants are , however , completely unknown for molecules at ultralow temperatures .",
    "to rectify this situation the present paper presents pilot calculations for cold collisions of molecular oxygen .",
    "this work is a logical next step following refs .",
    "@xcite , which considered the interaction of molecular oxygen a the helium buffer gas .",
    "spin- state- changing cold collisions of o@xmath10 molecules are driven by at least three distinct physical processes , two of which are already familiar from ultracold atom physics : i ) spin - exchange collisions , which typically lead to unacceptably large loss rates for both atoms and molecules ; ii ) spin - spin magnetic dipolar interactions , which are typically small in either case ; and iii ) spin - rotation interactions , unique to molecules , wherein electronic spins are influenced by their coupling to rotational motion , which is in turn dependent on torques exerted by the anisotropic potential energy surface(pes ) between the molecules .",
    "spin - exchange collisions can be avoided in cold molecule collisions , as in cold atom collisions , by preparing the molecules in their `` stretched '' states , with mechanical rotation , electronic spin , and nuclear spin ( if any ) all aligned along a common laboratory - fixed axis .",
    "we will therefore confine ourselves to this circumstance . by far the leading contribution to the rate constant for state- changing , lossy collisions  ( @xmath11 ) is then the spin - rotation coupling , as shown below in detailed calculations .",
    "indeed , when an exothermic exit channel is available , this coupling can yield loss rates comparable in magnitude to spin - exchange rates , i.e. , comparable to elastic collision rates .",
    "this is the case for the @xmath12o@xmath10 molecule .",
    "the spin- changing rate is , however , strongly suppressed when the only allowed exit channels are degenerate in energy with the incident channel and when the collision energy lies below a characteristic energy @xmath13 . in the stretched state of @xmath14o@xmath10",
    "this is indeed the case , since changing the molecular spin at low energy requires boosting the partial- wave angular momentum from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "these collisions are therefore suppressed by the wigner threshold law when @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the height of the @xmath16 centrifugal barrier . for @xmath14o@xmath10",
    "the barrier is roughly @xmath19 k , not far below the temperature that buffer - gas cooling can take these molecules .",
    "the potential for disaster in molecule cold collisions is far greater than in atom cold collisions .",
    "for example , hyperfine interactions are more complex , and include rotation - nuclear spin couplings that can invert spins .",
    "these are , however , expected to have minimal impact on the stretched - state molecules . also of potential significance",
    "are spin - vibration couplings , which we disregard in o@xmath10 owing to the extremely large vibrational excitation energy of ground state o@xmath10 molecules compared to the energy available to excite them .",
    "the vibrational degrees of freedom remain to be fully explored at ultralow temperatures , but it is expected that vibrational quenching  ( also an exothermic process ) can occur with appreciable rates  @xcite . finally , polar molecules are susceptible to particularly strong long - range anisotropies .",
    "while this is not of direct relevance to molecular oxygen , it can be devastating to the electrostatic trapping of polar molecules @xcite , and potentially dangerous for magnetically trapped molecules when the electric and molecular dipole moments are coupled .      the importance of molecular oxygen as a potential candidate for cooling and trapping experiments has been emphasized elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we will here consider o@xmath10 molecules that have been cooled to temperatures below 1k .",
    "we will furthermore assume that these molecules have relaxed to their electronic @xmath20 ground state , and @xmath21 vibrational ground state .",
    "what remain are the rotational and spin degrees of freedom that influence evaporative cooling . in a typical magnetostatic trap",
    "the molecules can be confined provided that they are in a weak - field - seeking state , i.e. , a state whose energy rises with magnetic field .",
    "the zeeman diagram of o@xmath10 is reproduced in figure 1 .",
    "nuclear exchange symmetry declares that homonuclear oxygen isotopomers can have only even or only odd values of the nuclear rotation quantum number @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath12o@xmath10  ( or @xmath23o@xmath10 ) , which has identical spin - zero nuclei , only odd values of @xmath22 are allowed . for the isotopomer @xmath14o@xmath10 , where each nucleus has spin @xmath24 , the allowed @xmath22 levels depend on the total nuclear spin @xmath25 .",
    "the molecules must have even values of @xmath22 for odd values of @xmath26 , and vice - versa .",
    "thus the lowest energy weak - field seeking states are latexmath:[$|n , jm_j \\rangle=    @xmath12o@xmath10 or @xmath23o@xmath10 , and @xmath28 for @xmath14o@xmath10 .",
    "these states are indicated by heavy lines in the figure .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the essential difference between the even-@xmath22 and odd-@xmath22 manifolds in o@xmath10 , from the standpoint of inelastic collisions .",
    "namely , the trapped states with @xmath29 in the @xmath30 manifold can decay exothermically to the untrapped @xmath31 states .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath32 trapped state at low energy and low magnetic field can only change its spin projection @xmath33 to other states that are nearly degenerate in energy .",
    "this difference proves crucial in strongly suppressing spin - rotation collisions in @xmath14o@xmath10 relative to @xmath12o@xmath10 .",
    "this has already been discussed for cold collisions of o@xmath10 with helium atoms @xcite ; the situation is similar when the molecules collide with each other . as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we carry out calculations in zero magnetic field .    in this paper",
    "we ignore the role of nuclear spin , hence of hyperfine structure , in the @xmath14o@xmath10 isotopomer .",
    "this is justified by considering the molecules to be in their stretched states of @xmath32 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the nuclear spin degrees of freedom are then frozen out . in principle the weak nuclear spin - rotation coupling",
    "would influence the nuclear spins , resulting in @xmath36 transitions , but these couplings are an order- of- magnitude smaller than the spin- rotation couplings we are already considering .",
    "moreover , measurements of the @xmath14o@xmath10 microwave spectrum  @xcite reveal that its hyperfine structure is inverted in its @xmath32 state , requiring that @xmath37 of kinetic energy be supplied to change @xmath38 .",
    "thus at ultralow temperatures hyperfine- state- changing collisions are rigorously forbidden .",
    "our investigation of molecular collisions follows the model of diatom - diatom scattering originally due to  @xcite , but modified to incorporate the electronic spin of oxygen molecules .",
    "the @xmath39 dimer has a spin - dependent intermolecular potential , namely three potential surfaces exist corresponding to singlet(@xmath40 ) , triplet(@xmath41 ) , and quintet ( @xmath42 ) states of total electronic spin @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "the complete hamiltonian for the collision process can be written @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the translational kinetic energy of molecule @xmath46 ; @xmath47 is the short - range exchange interaction ; @xmath48 is the long - range potential consisting of dispersion and electric quadrupole - quadrupole interactions ; @xmath49 is the electronic spin - spin dipolar interaction ; and @xmath50 is the hamiltonian for the rotational fine structure of the two separate oxygen molecules .",
    "the hyperfine interaction will be disregarded for now , as was discussed above .",
    "the short - range potential can be written as a mean interaction plus exchange corrections , following ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the polar angles of molecules a and b respectively , @xmath53 describes the radius vector between the center - of - mass of the molecules in the lab- fixed coordinate frame and @xmath54 here @xmath55_{m}^{l}$ ] and @xmath56 are reduced spherical harmonics .",
    "it should be said that the expansion  ( [ av ] ) is identical to that in  @xcite but written in terms of reduced spherical harmonics .",
    "the spin - dependent heisenberg exchange term @xmath57 is expanded similarly , but with a different expansion coefficient @xmath58 .",
    "the expressions for expansion coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath58 were obtained in the work of  @xcite , and the quadrupole- quadrupole interaction has a similar form .",
    "the @xmath60 dispersion coefficients were calculated in  @xcite in the body- fixed frame . to unify our treatment we recast the anisotropic @xmath61 coefficients in terms of the same angular basis as the exchange potential : @xmath62 where @xmath63 the connection between our coefficients @xmath64 and coefficients from  @xcite is in appendix a. figure 2 shows a slice through the potential energy surface for the singlet states of the @xmath65_2 $ ] dimer for the `` h''-geometry of the two molecules , which passes through the global minimum of the pes . also shown are contributions to this potential from various components with different @xmath66 .",
    "we can see that this potential has a very strong anisotropy .",
    "notice that the isotropic contribution , with @xmath67 accounts for less than half of the total well depth .    as in the case of ultracold atoms , details of ultracold molecular collisions",
    "depend extremely sensitively on details of pes .",
    "thus eventually the pes must be fine- tuned using key experimental data to provide complete quantitative results  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the order - of- magnitude of the rate constants , and their general trends , already emerge clearly in the present model .",
    "the intermolecular spin - spin ( magnetic dipole ) interaction has the form  @xcite : @xmath68^{\\bf 2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the bohr magneton . for alkali atoms this",
    "is known to be a fairly weak contribution to spin - changing collisions , a conclusion that we find holds for molecules as well .",
    "finally , in our model we take into account the molecular fine structure , which arises from the molecular rotation and spin - rotation coupling and is diagonal in our total - spin basis at large r. for @xmath2 we use the fine- structure constants determined in  @xcite , and for @xmath1 we employ those determined in  @xcite .",
    "we express the hamiltonian in a basis of total angular momentum , @xmath72 in the terms of each molecule s mechanical rotation ( @xmath73 ) , its electronic spin ( @xmath74 ) , its total spin ( @xmath75 ) , the combined spin for two molecules together ( @xmath76 ) , and the partial wave representing the rotation of the molecule about the center of mass ( @xmath77 ) . in zero magnetic field",
    "both @xmath78 and its laboratory - fixed projection @xmath79 are rigorously conserved .    in this basis",
    "we can present our wave function as : @xmath80 where @xmath81 represent the electronic spin coordinates for molecule a , b .",

    "because target and projectile are identical bosons , we must take into account the symmetry of the wave function under exchange . to this end",

    "figure 5 also exhibits dozens of resonances for molecular- molecular collisions below 1k , arising from the enormous number of internal molecular states  @xcite .",
    "although we do not assign quantum numbers to the resonant states here , we expect them to be of two basic types , as discussed in  @xcite : i ) coupled- channel shape resonances ; ii ) `` rotational feshbach '' resonances that change the value of n of one or more molecules .",
    "this last type of resonance can be extremely long- lived , owing to the difficulty of both molecules returning to their rotationless state in a collision .",
    "indeed , one such resonance at @xmath146 has a width @xmath147 .",
    "we will return to this subject in a future publication .",
    "figure 5 shows that the elastic cross section has a very large value near zero energy , corresponding to a scattering length @xmath148 in the present model .",
    "it is therefore possible that there may be an s- wave bound state in the region of negative energies near the threshold of the channel . in this case",
    "the cross section should have @xmath149 dependence  @xcite on energy e and on the energy of the bound state @xmath150 .",
    "we have included the dipole- dipole interaction in these calculations . however",
    "the role of this interaction is very small in general , influencing the cross section at the @xmath151 level and shifting resonance positions slightly .",
    "likewise , this interaction is only a small perturbation to inelastic scattering .      for the @xmath134 state of interest to trapping experiments ,",
    "@xmath152 and @xmath153 are conserved at low energy , since the next energetically available state ( with @xmath139 ) is 11.18k higher in energy  ( fig.1 ) .",
    "thus the only possible final states are those which differ from the initial one in their projections @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "to accomplish such a transition therefore requires that the angular momentum be carried away in the orbital angular momentum @xmath135 .",
    "furthermore , the collisions that originate in s- wave channels will be suppressed at energies below the centrifugal barrier of the d- wave exit channel .",
    "using an effective @xmath60 coefficient , @xmath156 from  @xcite this energy for a partial wave @xmath135 can be approximated as @xmath157 for @xmath158 , @xmath159 and the d - wave threshold energy is @xmath160 .",
    "the main aim of this paper , as previously discussed , is to compare the elastic and loss rate constants .",
    "figure 6a shows these rates calculated according to  eqn.([rate ] ) .",
    "away from resonances , in the energy range up to @xmath161 the loss rate constant is indeed strongly suppressed .",
    "a detailed examination of the final states contributing to this loss reveals general features which are the similar to those for @xmath162 scattering .",
    "namely , elastic scattering , which does not change either @xmath154 or @xmath155 , is the most probable result of a collision .",
    "the next most likely processes are those for which the final @xmath163 differs from the initial one by 1 or 2 and the rates for these processes are smaller than the elastic rate by one -two orders of magnitude .",
    "the processes for which the final @xmath163 differs from the initial one by 3 or 4 have rates smaller than for elastic scattering by 2 - 4 order of magnitude . for energies above @xmath146 inelastic processes",
    "become more probable , with rates only about 7- 10 times smaller than elastic rates .",
    "the thermally averaged elastic and loss rates are relevant to the experimental situation .",
    "if we assume the velocity distribution is maxwellian characterized by a kinetic temperature t we can calculate the thermally- averaged rate constant as : @xmath164 to do this averaging we extrapolate the cross sections to energies @xmath165 using their values at @xmath166 .",
    "figure 6b shows these thermally averaged elastic and loss rates .",
    "for the cooling to be efficient the rate of elastic collisions @xmath167 must exceed the rate of spin- changing , lossy collisions @xmath168 by at least two orders of magnitude  @xcite . for @xmath1 , below @xmath169 this condition is fullfilled .",
    "however , there is a `` relatively dangerous temperature range '' above @xmath170 where @xmath171 . by comparison ,",
    "consider the equivalent ratio for @xmath172 scattering , as discussed in ref .",
    "the fact that @xmath173 is not so large as for @xmath172 collisions originates from the stronger anisotropy and the deeper pes for the @xmath174 system .",
    "it remains to be seen if the loss rates are sufficiently low to evaporatively cool from buffer- gas temperatures , @xmath132 , down to @xmath175 , where cooling should be quite efficient .",
    "it is a different situation for @xmath2 molecules from the point of view of comparing elastic and inelastic cross sections .",
    "the general behavior of the elastic cross section for different channels is similar to that of @xmath1 and has the same order of magnitude except in the energy region near zero which is very sensitive to the details of the potential and the reduced mass . with the present pes the @xmath2 scattering length is 28a.u .",
    "figure 7 shows the elastic and all the inelastic cross sections for the trapped state @xmath176 .",
    "the total number of inelastic channels is 25 . when the final states are @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 and so on , i.e when at least one of the molecules changes to the @xmath31 state , the collision is superelastic .",
    "it is well known that for a superelastic channel there is @xmath180 threshold law .",
    "thus at a low energy there is a substantial loss of molecules from the @xmath181 state .",
    "the same result holds for @xmath182 state which is also , of course , susceptible to spin- exchange .",
    "thus @xmath2 is clearly unstable against collisional losses in a magnetic trap , in sharp contrast to @xmath1 .",
    "the cross sections for the stretched states of @xmath2 molecules that we are interested in have a smooth structure in the energy region up to 1k , implying either a lack of resonances in this region or their large widths . from figure 7 we can see just one sharp feshbach- type resonance near @xmath183 belonging to an @xmath144 bound state . although there may be other weak resonances , it was not our aim to find all the resonances and identify their nature in this article .",
    "in this article we theoretically investigated ground state diatom- diatom collisions in the energy range up to 1k taking different isotopomers of oxygen molecules as a prototype .",
    "the main point of our investigation was to estimate the ratio of elastic and inelastic rate constants .",
    "the influence of the rotational degrees of freedom is crucial in determining this ratio . in the case of the odd n- manifold ,",
    "it is probably impossible to satisfy the criterion @xmath184 for stretched states in any energy region , because of both the strong anisotropy of the pes and the existence of the superelastic channels . in the case of the even n- manifold , namely @xmath32",
    ", this criterion can be fullfilled because for the stretched state @xmath136 there are no superelastic channels .",
    "even though the required ratio of @xmath7 is not quite met at buffer gas temperatures , it is worth remembering that the buffer - gas procedure typically produces a far larger sample of trapped molecules than do the laser cooling experiments on which evaporative cooling is usually applied .",
    "thus it is possible that a larger loss rate could be sustained without harming the overall yield of molecules at ultralow temperatures .",
    "detailed rate - equation simulations of the cooling process are therefore required , an item to which we will turn our attention in the future .    equally importantly ,",
    "once the molecules have in fact been cooled to @xmath185k temperatures , out results imply that the lossy collision rates have diminished into insignificance , falling to levels well below @xmath186 @xmath9/sec .",
    "this in turn implies that ultracold spin - polarized @xmath14o@xmath10 gases , like their atomic counterparts , are experimentally stable and should allow the production of novel bose - einstein condensates .    beyond the immediate results for our particular model of @xmath14o@xmath10 , the present results have broad implications for many paramagnetic molecular species .",
    "namely , the characteristic suppression of loss rates below the @xmath187-wave centrifugal barrier should be a generic feature for molecules where no superelastic fine - structure - changing processes exist .",
    "it is also important to assess in detail the influence of the anisotropy of the pes . for this purpose",
    "further investigations are necessary .        using the dispersion contribution part from  @xcite and expanding this part in the terms of spherical reduced harmonics  ( [ disp ] ) in the lab - fixed coordinate frame we defined the connection between our coefficients @xmath64 and coefficients @xmath188 from  @xcite : @xmath189    a. fioretti _",
