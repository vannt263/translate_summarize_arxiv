    "many observational facts suggest that our universe is now in the period of accelerated expansion but its physical origin is yet to be understood @xcite . this might be a result of an exotic form of energy with negative pressure that should be added to the right - hand - side of the einstein equation as the cosmological constant @xmath8 , or more generally a time varying dark energy term .",
    "another possibility is that gravity is not described by the einstein equation on cosmological scales",
    ". therefore observational tests of gravity theories on cosmological scales are important , and the redshift space distortion ( rsd ) effect observed in galaxy redshift surveys gives such a test .",
    "rsd is distortion of a galaxy distribution in redshift space caused by peculiar motions of the galaxies ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is expressed by the anisotropy parameter @xmath9 at the linear level @xcite , where @xmath10 is the linear growth rate of the fractional density fluctuations @xmath11 , @xmath12 the scale factor of the universe , and @xmath13 the galaxy bias with respect to the matter distribution .",
    "this is simply a result of the mass continuity that relates the growth rate and the velocity of large - scale systematic infall motion , and thus is always valid regardless of gravity theories .",
    "when the galaxy bias is independently measured , one can derive the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "when the galaxy bias is unknown , we can still measure the combination of @xmath0 using the observed fluctuation amplitude of the galaxy density field , where @xmath15 is the rms amplitude of the mass fluctuations on comoving @xmath16 scale .",
    "a number of measurements of the growth rate have been reported up to @xmath17 by using the data of various galaxy surveys ( @xcite ) . in the near future",
    "we expect more rsd measurements at even higher redshifts .",
    "although the statistical significance is not as large as those at lower redshifts , an rsd measurement at @xmath18 has also been reported by @xcite .",
    "planned / on - going surveys , such as vlt / vipers ( @xmath19 ) , subaru / fastsound ( @xmath20 ) and hetdex ( @xmath21 ) , will give further constraints on the modified gravity theories proposed to explain the accelerated cosmic expansion .",
    "however , there are several effects that could result in systematic errors of the growth rate measurement , e.g. , the non - linear evolution of the power spectrum , and the galaxy / halo bias .",
    "these must carefully be examined in advance of future ambitious surveys , in which the systematic error might be larger than the statistical error .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the importance of non - linear corrections to the growth - rate parameter measurement by using the multipole moment method for the linear power spectrum @xcite with an assumption of a scale - independent constant halo bias , by using halo catalogues from n - body simulations at @xmath22 .",
    "a simple step to go beyond the linear - theory formula is to include the effect of the velocity dispersion that erases the apparent fluctuations on small scales @xcite .",
    "although this effect was originally discussed to describe the random motions of galaxies inside a halo and usually referred to as the finger - of - god ( fog ) effect ( @xcite ) , the presence of any pairwise velocity between galaxies ( or even haloes ) results in the damping of the clustering amplitude ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is often phenomenologically modeled by multiplying a damping factor that reflects the pairwise velocity distribution function .",
    "@xcite found that the rsd parameter @xmath23 measured using this approach has a systematic error of up to 10 per cent for galaxy - sized haloes in simulated halo catalogues at @xmath24 .    another step to include the effect of the non - linear evolution is to use analytical redshift - space formulae of the power spectrum and/or the correlation function for modestly non - linear scales larger than the fog scale ( @xcite ; @xcite ( tns ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that an accuracy of 4 per cent is achievable for measurements of @xmath14 from two - dimentional ( 2d ) two - point correlation functions , when the tns formula for the matter power spectrum is applied . in these previous studies ,",
    "the halo bias was treated as a constant free parameter , or the correct scale - dependence of the bias parameter directly measured from numerical simulations was used , to derive the rsd parameters . however , in real surveys the true bias can not be measured and hence it is uncertain whether this accuracy can really be achieved . a more practical method to include",
    "the effect of a general scale - dependent bias is to use phenomenological and parametrized bias models , such as the parametrization proposed by @xcite ( we call it ` q - model bias ' in this paper ) , but such models have not been extensively tested in the previous studies .",
    "in addition to these analytical approaches , there are fully empirical rsd models based on n - body simulations both in fourier and in configuration spaces .",
    "@xcite reported that , by employing their fitting formula for the non - linear power spectra of velocity divergence @xcite , they can recover the correct growth rate @xmath14 from the redshift - space matter power spectrum .",
    "also , @xcite developed an empirical fitting function of the 2d correlation function , and also recover the correct value of the growth rate @xmath14 from halo catalogues by excluding small - scale regions from their analysis .    in this study , we investigate the accuracy of the rsd measurement for various halo catalogues at three redshifts of 0.5 , 1.35 and 2 . especially , we investigate how the accuracy improves by using the tns formula of the power spectrum with the scale - dependent q - model bias .",
    "we run high - resolution cosmological n - body simulations of collisionless dark matter particles , and produce 40 realisations of halo catalogues in a comoving volume of @xmath1 @xmath25 at each of the three redshifts .",
    "we then measure the growth rate @xmath0 by fitting the 2d halo power spectrum @xmath26 with theoretical models , where @xmath27 is the wavenumber and @xmath28 the cosine of the angle between the line - of - sight and the wavevector .",
    "we search six model parameters : @xmath14 , the three parameters of the q - model bias , the one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath29 , and the amplitude of the mass fluctuations @xmath15 .",

    "we use the fiducial value of the density fluctuation amplitude @xmath88 and the linear - theory growth factor at each redshift .    in the mcmc analysis , we treat @xmath15 as a free parameter and re - scale the template spectra as follows .",
    "we replace the density and velocity spectra as @xmath89 and the correction terms as @xmath90 . these replacements are valid at the leading order , and we expect that the error induced by this approximated treatment would be small .",
    "this procedure significantly saves computing time to calculate the spectra for a given value of @xmath15 .    as for the halo bias ,",
    "we assume a linear bias @xmath91 , and we adopt two models : a constant bias and a parametrized ` q - model ' bias to allow scale - dependence ( or , equivalently , non - locality of the relation between the halo and matter density fields ) @xcite .",
    "these are expressed as @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are model parameters .    to summarize , we test the following four theoretical models for the 2d halo power spectrum in redshift space : ` kaiser+constant bias ' , ` kaiser+q - model bias ' , ` tns+constant bias ' and ` tns+q - model bias ' in this study .",
    "all the models include the four parameters , @xmath96 and @xmath15 .",

    "when we analyse the matter power spectrum , we fix the bias parameters as @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .      in this study , we employ the maximum likelihood estimation using the mcmc method and find the best - fitting model parameters as well as their allowed regions .",
    "in contrast to the analysis using the ratio of the multipole moments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we try to fit the shape of the 2d power spectrum , @xmath30 , directly .",
    "in such a case , we should take into account the fact that there is only a small numbers of fourier modes in a @xmath99 bin .",
    "if the measured power spectrum @xmath75 at each @xmath99 bin follows the gaussian distribution , the likelihood can be written as @xmath100 , where the chi - square @xmath101 is calculated in the standard manner from the measured and expected values of @xmath75 and its standard deviation .",
    "in reality , however , @xmath75 does not follow the gaussian but the chi - squared distribution even when the density contrast itself is perfectly gaussian . in order to take into account this statistical property in the maximum likelihood estimation ,",
    "we apply the wilson - hilferty ( wh ) transformation @xcite that makes a @xmath101 distribution into an approximate gaussian .",
    "we define a new variable @xmath102 and @xmath103 is expected to approximately obey the gaussian distribution with a mean of @xmath104 ( p_\\mathrm{true } \\!+\\!p_\\mathrm{shot})^{1/3 } \\label{eq : wh1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and a variance of @xmath105 it should be noted that the power spectrum amplitude directly measured from the simulations , @xmath106 , does not exactly obey the chi - squared distribution , because it includes the shot noise term . however , the wh transformation should be effective only at small wavenumbers where the number of modes in a @xmath27-space bin is small , and the shot noise term is relatively unimportant also at small wavenumbers .",
    "therefore we adopt the above transformation , expecting that @xmath106 approximately obeys a chi - squared distribution .",

    "it is easy to show that , from the kaiser formula , a systematically lower value of @xmath0 than the input value is favored to reproduce the rsd effect at large @xmath28 , when @xmath15 is overestimated . in a fitting to the halo spectrum , there are degrees of freedom for bias models , but the non - linear power enhancement at high-@xmath27 can not be completely absorbed by the constant or q - model bias .",
    "the power enhancement can also be absorbed to some extent by reducing @xmath29 in the fog damping factor , but fig .",

    "the power enhancement that can not be absorbed by bias modelings or the fog parameter then favors a larger @xmath0 than the correct value , at the cost of a poorer agreement at low-@xmath27 .",
    "the systematic underestimation of @xmath0 when we employ the tns+constant bias model might be a result of the discrepancy between the correct bias measured directly from simulations and the best - fitting constant bias at low-@xmath27 ( @xmath160 , see dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : halo_001_0100_bias ] ) , because the bias shape of the best - fitting model of the tns+q - model bias is close to the simulation - measured bias .    compared with the sizes of statistical errors for the kaiser+constant bias model",
    ", we get nearly equal sizes of errors for the kaiser+q - model bias , 1.52 times larger errors for the tns+constant bias and 2.5 times larger errors for the tns+q - model bias .",

    ".  [ section : rsdmodel_2]).,width=302 ]    the behavior beyond @xmath118 depends on the mass of haloes as well as redshift . in some cases , a value of @xmath0 consistent with its input value is successfully recovered up to much higher wavenumbers ( see e.g. , the heaviest halo catalogue at @xmath4 , from which we can measure the correct @xmath0 values up to @xmath174 ) .",
    "however this result should be taken with care .",
    "this apparently successful recovery of @xmath0 is probably because of the rather flexible functional form of the scale - dependent bias adopted in this paper .",
    "the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath94 can sometimes absorb the mismatch between the true _ matter _ power spectra and the tns model beyond @xmath118 without leaving systematics to @xmath0 for some special cases .",
    "the situation would probably be quite different when different parameterizations are chosen for @xmath175 . nevertheless , it is of interest to explore the possibility to add some more information from higher wavenumbers .",
    "although we , in this paper , employ only one particular functional form for the scale - dependent bias as well as a constant bias model , the reproductivity of the growth - rate parameter from high-@xmath27 modes with different bias functions is also of interest .",
    "we leave further investigations along this line for future studies .      in this subsection , we give some implications for future use of our analysis methodologies . as seen above , we have demonstrated that we can measure @xmath0 with a systematic error of @xmath176 per cent by using the tns model combined with the q - model bias , provided that the used wavenumber range is @xmath177 and haloes are not strongly biased ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "@xcite showed the expected constraints on the growth rate @xmath179 for some on - going and planned surveys ( fig .  6 and table iii in their paper ) .",
    "the estimated 1-@xmath131 statistical errors are 7.53.9 per cent at redshift @xmath180@xmath181 for sumire - pfs , and 5.1 per cent at @xmath182 for hetdex .",
    "this means that the tns+q - model bias fit can reduce the systematic errors arising from the non - linear effects and the halo bias to be comparable or lower than the statistical errors from these surveys .",
    "the space mission euclid will survey over a redshift range of @xmath183 and get redshifts of 50 million galaxies .",
    "the number of galaxies in each redshift bin will be more than one million .",
    "we can roughly estimate the statistical error expected from euclid to be a few per cent level , by using an empirical formula @xmath184 @xcite where @xmath185 is the number of galaxies .",
    "this estimation indicates that we need to further improve the modeling of rsd , to make the systematic error smaller than the statistical error of euclid .",
    "we have investigated how accurately the structure growth rate @xmath0 can be measured from the rsd effects through the model fittings .",
    "we have used the halo catalogues generated from n - body simulations assuming the standard @xmath8cdm universe with general relativity , at @xmath4 , 1.35 and 2 for various minimum halo mass thresholds of @xmath186 @xmath187 .",
    "we have tested two analytical models for the 2d power spectrum in redshift space : the kaiser model and the tns model including the higher - order coupling terms between the density and velocity fields .",
    "we have implemented two models for the halo bias : a constant bias and a scale - dependent parametric bias model ( i.e. , q - model ) .",
    "we find significant systematic error ( more than 10 per cent for @xmath188 ) when the kaiser model is simply adopted regardless of the bias modelings , which is consistent with previous studies . under the assumption of the constant bias ,",
    "the systematic error still remains even when we employ the tns model .",
    "however , when we use the tns model with the q - model bias , the systematic error can be reduced to @xmath189 5 per cent for all the redshifts and mass thresholds , by using the wavenumber range up to @xmath118 ( e.g. @xmath190 , 0.27 and @xmath191 at @xmath4 , 1.35 and 2 , respectively ) .    for some heavy halo catalogues at @xmath4",
    ", the tns+q - model gives the accurate @xmath0 measurement significantly beyond @xmath118 .",
    "this is probably because the q - model bias model absorbs the difference between the simulated matter power spectrum and the tns model prediction , but this feature is only for particular cases , and a further investigation is necessary . at lower mass ranges ,",
    "the tns+q - model gives clearly biased @xmath0 estimates at @xmath192 , especially at lower redshifts where the non - linear effects are more significant .",
    "we conclude that the tns model as a 2d power spectrum formula combined with the q - model bias is a powerful tool to measure the structure growth rate .",
    "the systematic error can be reduced to under 5 per cent at @xmath193 , which is comparable with or smaller than the expected statistical errors of near - future ground - based surveys at high redshifts , such as sumire - pfs and hetdex .",
    "some future ambitious surveys , such as euclid , will achieve even smaller statistical errors , and we will need to pursue more accurate theoretical models taking into account the non - linear effects and the halo / galaxy bias .",
    "we also note that the tns formula is valid only when gravity is described by general relativity",
    ". therefore this model can not be used for a test of other theories of gravity , but still it can be used to test whether general relativity is a valid theory to describe the formation of large - scale structure .    finally , we note on the importance of an appropriate treatment for the @xmath0 measurement , when only a small number of fourier modes are available in a @xmath27-space bin of power spectrum measurements . in such a case , a measured power spectrum @xmath194 in eq .",
