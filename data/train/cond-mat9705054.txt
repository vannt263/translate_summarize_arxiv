    "the aharonov - bohm effect leads to a number of remarkable interference phenomena in mesoscopic systems , especially in rings @xcite .",
    "based on the discovery of the geometric phases @xcite , including the adiabatic berry phase @xcite and the nonadiabatic aharonov - anandan ( aa ) phase @xcite , it has been predicted that analogous interference phenomena can be induced by the geometric phases which originate from the interplay between electrons orbital and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "such interplay can be produced by external electric and magnetic fields , which lead to zeeman coupling and spin - orbit ( so ) interaction respectively .",
    "loss _ et al . _ first studied the textured ring embedded in inhomogeneous magnetic field @xcite .",
    "they found the inhomogeneity of the field results in a berry phase , which can produce the persistent currents .",
    "the effects of this berry phase on conductivity were then discussed @xcite .",
    "it was further pointed out that the adiabatic condition is not necessary for the geometric phase to exist , and the aa phase in textured rings can produce the persistent currents as well @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the aharonov - casher ( ac ) effect @xcite in mesoscopic systems has attracted much attention .",
    "et al . _ showed for the first time that so interaction in one - dimensional ( 1d ) rings results in an effective magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "mathur and stone then pointed out that observable phenomena induced by so interaction are the manifestations of the ac effect in electronic systems @xcite .",
    "these authors investigated the effects of so interaction on the persistent - current paramagnetism and the quantum transport in disordered systems , and obtained specific reduction factors for harmonics in ab oscillations @xcite . in case",
    "the ac flux is not random , it can lead to interference phenomena as ab flux .",
    "mathur and stone proposed an observation of the ac oscillation of the conductance on semiconductor samples @xcite .",
    "balatsky and altshuler @xcite and choi @xcite studied the persistent currents produced by the ac effect .",
    "inspired by the study on textured rings , the ac effect has also been analyzed in connection with the spin geometric phase .",
    "aronov and lyanda - geller considered the spin evolution in conducting rings , and found that so interaction results in a spin - orbit berry phase which plays an interesting role in the transmission probability of the rings @xcite . in their models , there is a zeeman coupling from uniform magnetic field , but the so berry phase can be caused by so interaction alone .",
    "so they has indeed shown the existence of the berry phase in the ac effect . since so interaction is usually not strong enough to guarantee the validity of adiabatic approximation , a nonadiabatic treatment of the problem is necessary . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we demonstrated the existence of a nonadiabatic aa phase in the ac effect in 1d rings .",
    "we found the ac flux and local spin orientations of the electronic eigenstates are determined by a spin cyclic evolution .",
    "in particular , we showed the ac phase comprises both the aa and the dynamical phases which are acquired in the cyclic evolution , and the adiabatic limit of the aa phase is just the so berry phase . based on this geometric phase approach for the ac effect , oh and ryu studied the persistent currents produced by the cylindrically symmetric so interaction in 1d rings @xcite .    as is well known , so interaction is time - reversal invariant while zeeman coupling breaks the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "many prior works have shown the significance of the trs and its breaking with regard to various interference phenomena caused by ab flux and so interaction .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to investigate if the coexistence of so interaction and zeeman coupling can produce any new observable effect with the spin degree of freedom being fully taken into account .",
    "however , most of the previous studies have focused on the rings in the presence of zeeman coupling or so interaction only . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have demonstrated that the competition between zeeman coupling and so interaction can produce persistent currents through the trs breaking in a many - electron ring with a complete set of current - carrying single - particle states .",
    "for the transport properties , aronov and lyanda - geller @xcite have derived a transmission probability for a conducting ring in the presence of both the so interaction and the zeeman coupling , by making use of the concept of berry phase .",
    "unfortunately , they failed to take into account correctly the different properties of so interaction and zeeman coupling under the time - reversal transformation .",
    "as a result , they have not realized that their picture of effective flux for the interference of spin - polarized electrons is actually invalidated by the trs - breaking zeeman coupling .",
    "furthermore , even if the zeeman coupling is absent , their expression for the effective flux induced by the so interaction is still not complete .",
    "so the transport properties of a ring in the presence of both so interaction and zeeman coupling have not been solved yet and the roles of trs and its breaking therein need to be clarified .    in this paper , we will discuss the transport properties of a ring in the presence of both the so interaction and the zeeman coupling .",
    "we will explore the roles of the trs and its breaking in the transport phenomena when the spin degree of freedom is taken into account explicitly .",
    "we will also show the connection between the observable trs - breaking effects manifested by the persistent current and by the transmission probability . throughout the discussion",
    ", we will emphasize the trs by investigating how the trs - breaking zeeman coupling affects the thermodynamic and transport properties of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first solve the spin cyclic evolution and find the corresponding geometric and dynamical phases for the system .",
    "the electronic eigenstates of the closed ring are then derived . the geometric phase and the exact solution for the ring with only zeeman coupling @xcite or so interaction @xcite are shown to be the limit of zero electric field or the limit of zero magnetic field in our results .",
    "on the other hand , the so berry phase , first introduced by aronov and lyanda - geller @xcite , is simply the adiabatic limit of the geometric aa phase here . in sec .",
    "iii , we first derive an exact expression for the transfer matrices of the two ring branches ( arms ) by introducing four auxiliary spin states , which exhibit the orbital quantum number dependence of the spin orientations in electronic eigenstates .",
    "then we calculate the transmission probability of the ring .",
    "we show that the presence of zeeman coupling makes the spin orientations in energy eigenstates depend on the spin and the orbital quantum numbers simultaneously . as a consequence ,",
    "the effective spin - dependent flux description , which has been established for so interaction only , becomes inadequate .",
    "that explains why the results in ref .",
    "@xcite are not correct",
    ". when the zeeman coupling is absent , the derived transmission probability agrees with the relations obtained by meir _",
    "et al . _ for general spin - independent thermodynamic and transport properties .",
    "we finally carry out some numerical calculations to illustrate the effects of so interaction and zeeman coupling .",
    "we find there is an interesting and observable correspondence between the trs - breaking effects manifested by the transmission probability and by the persistent current .",
    "that correspondence , if experimentally verified or excluded in some specific ring , may serve to detect if the electron - electron interaction is of qualitative importance in determining electronic states . in sec .",
    "iv , we conclude with a summary of our results .",
    "the hamiltonian for an electron in the electric field @xmath0 and the magnetic field @xmath1 is @xmath2 we consider a ring that is effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) and the fields which are cylindrically symmetric , i.e. , @xmath3 , @xmath4 in the cylindrical coordinate system . for the ring lying in the @xmath5 plane with its center at the origin ,",

    "the eigenvalue equation of the system can be solved through a straightforward diagonalization , as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we adopt the geometric phase approach @xcite , in order to identify the geometric and the dynamical phases in current - carrying eigenstates , which are responsible for transporting electrons when the ring is connected to current leads .",
    "how the phases and the spin orientations jointly affect the transmission probability will be elaborated in the next section .",
    "the cylindrical symmetry of the system leads to the conservation of total angular momentum @xmath13 , which means the eigenstates of hamiltonian ( 2 ) are of the form @xmath14 , in which @xmath15 , @xmath16 are arbitrary integers , and the spin states are given by @xmath17;\\;\\;\\ ; \\tilde{\\psi}_{n,-}(\\theta)=\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\sin\\displaystyle\\frac{\\beta_{n}}{2}\\\\           -e^{{\\it i}\\theta}\\cos\\displaystyle\\frac{\\beta_{n}}{2}\\\\ \\end{array } \\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 is @xmath11-independent . from @xmath19 as a function of @xmath11 , it is readily seen that the local spin orientations at @xmath11 is in the direction of @xmath20 . the explicit expression for the spin tilt angle @xmath18",
    "can be obtained by introducing a cyclic evolution of spin state for electrons encircling the ring , as presented in ref .",
    "the geometric and the dynamical phases associated with the spin precession can thereby be identified for all of the energy eigenstates to determine the whole energy spectrum .",
    "such an approach has the advantage of explicitly exhibiting the geometric phase and the adiabatic criterion , which acquire their original meanings in time - dependent problems .",

    "the geometric aa phase @xmath27 is the -1/2 of the solid angle subtended by a circuit traced on a sphere by the local spin orientation of @xmath25 .",
    "it is readily seen that the zeeman coupling makes the spin orientations of electronic eigenstates depend on the orbital quantum number .",
    "the consequence of such interplay between the spin and the orbital degrees of freedom will be explored when we discuss the transport properties of the ring .    with use of @xmath18 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , the eigenvalues @xmath34 of @xmath25",
    "is found to be @xmath35 the first term in the right side represents the energy from orbital motion , the second term the zero - point energy , while the third term comes from the spin precession originating from the interplay between the spin and the orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "the exact solution derived above reduces to the various limits that have been obtained separately in literatures .",
    "the cylindrically symmetric textured ring , first studied under the adiabatic approximation @xcite and then exactly solved in refs .",
    "@xcite , corresponds to the @xmath36 limit .",
    "the ac effect induced by cylindrically symmetric so interaction in the ring , first discussed for vertical field @xcite and then investigated for more general field configurations@xcite , corresponds to the @xmath37 limit . on the other hand , with both nonzero @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the so berry phase , first introduced for a conducting ring @xcite , is simply the adiabatic limit of the aa phase .",
    "now we turn to the adiabatic limit of the exact solution .",
    "since the original stationary schr \" odinger equation is solved via the solution of the time - dependent problem , the adiabatic criterion can be easily deduced . comparing @xmath18 with the tilt angle of the effective magnetic field in @xmath23",
    ", we find the adiabatic criterion is @xmath40 for the textured ring with @xmath41 , this condition states that the zeeman frequency @xmath42 must be much larger than the orbital frequency @xmath31 unless @xmath43 @xcite . for the ac effect with @xmath44",
    ", this condition requires that the dimensionless so coefficient @xmath45 must be much larger than @xmath46 unless @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "in this section , we discuss the transport properties of the ring described by hamiltonian ( 2 ) . now",
    "the ring is connected to external current leads , schematicly illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . we adopt the standard formulation developed in the study of quantum oscillations in 1d rings threaded by ab flux @xcite . in the upper and the lower branches ,",
    "the wave amplitudes at one end are related to the wave amplitudes at the other end by the transfer matrices as @xmath48=\\underline { t}_{i}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\beta_{1 } ' \\\\ \\beta_{1}\\end{array}\\right],\\;\\;\\ ; \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\gamma_{1 } \\\\ \\gamma_{1}'\\end{array}\\right]=\\underline { t}_{ii}'\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\gamma_{2 } ' \\\\ \\gamma_{2}\\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the transfer matrices of the upper and lower branches respectively , and they depend on the energy @xmath38 of the incident wave . at the two junctions , the amplitudes of the three outgoing waves @xmath51",

    "this formulation is in general applicable to the derivation of the transmission probability through any ring , provided the corresponding transfer matrices are known .",
    "note that in the study of the ring only threaded by ab flux , electrons can be treated as spinless particles , so that all amplitudes are simply represented by complex numbers and matrix @xmath62 can be dropped . in this paper , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ,",
    "@xmath66 have to be represented by two - component spinors and @xmath67 , @xmath68 are @xmath69 matrices .",
    "to derive an explicit expression for the two transfer matrices , we first identify the electronic states in the ring by making use of its cylindrical symmetry . if we write @xmath67 , @xmath68 in @xmath70 matrix form ,",
    "then each matrix element is a @xmath70 matrix in spin space .",
    "we can easily conclude that the off - diagonal elements of @xmath67 , @xmath68 are zero because of the conservation of @xmath71 , which indicates that in each branch any propagating wave with fixed energy can posses a well - defined momentum and pass each branch without reflection , as a result of the cylindrical symmetry of the external fields and the absence of scattering potential .",
    "so our task reduces to finding the four @xmath63 matrices which respectively relate @xmath72 with @xmath73 , @xmath74 with @xmath75 , for the upper branch , and relate @xmath76 with @xmath77 , @xmath78 with @xmath79 , for the lower branch .",
    "these four @xmath63 matrices are the four nonzero diagonal elements of @xmath67 , @xmath68 directly .",
    "the electrons tunneling through the ring is carried out by the energy eigenstate of the ring connected to two ideal conductors .",

    "the corresponding eigenenergy of the steady transport state is @xmath81 . in the right conductor",
    "the electronic state is a superposition of the incident plane wave @xmath64 and the reflected plane wave @xmath65 , while in the left conductor the propagating wave is just the transmitted plane wave @xmath82 .",
    "the state inside the ring is a superposition of four wavefunctions of energy @xmath83 .",
    "they actually determine the four non - zero matrix elements defined above for the two diagonal transfer matrices .    to find the four components of the electronic wave inside the ring , we first use the energy expression @xmath84 to find four solutions of @xmath16 , which are positive @xmath85 and negative @xmath86 with @xmath87 , and positive @xmath88 and negative @xmath89 with @xmath90 . for arbitrary @xmath80 ,",
