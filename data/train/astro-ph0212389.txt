    "x - ray spectroscopy and variability analyses can play a crucial role in constraining the physical processes which occur in these agn . for instance , the numerous x - ray spectroscopic and variability studies made prior to the launches of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have found that ( 1 ) agn x - ray spectra often show signs of complex absorption , reflection , and emission lines in addition to their power - law continuum radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , ( 2 ) the strengths of these spectral features ( especially the reflection and emission components ) depend on luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( 3 ) a large fraction of agn demonstrate variability of either continuum emission or absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , these studies have generally focused on small samples of bright objects ( @xmath15  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath16 ) , which are comprised of either nearby , moderate - luminosity agn or rare , high - luminosity agn at large look - back times .",
    "the deepest observations performed by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ now present the opportunity to study agn @xmath17  100 times fainter in similar detail and thus place constraints on moderate - luminosity agn at earlier epochs . here",
    "we report on the spectral and temporal properties of the agn in the 2  ms exposure of the _ chandra _ deep field - north ( cdf - n ) , which probes @xmath1810 times fainter in the 0.58.0  kev band than any other _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ survey , and at least 50 and 250 times fainter than any past x - ray instrument in the 0.52.0  kev and 2.08.0  kev bands , respectively .",
    "our sample was selected to ensure that we have adequate photon statistics for spectral and temporal analyses and is comprised of the 136 extragalactic x - ray sources with more than 200 background - subtracted , 0.58.0  kev counts in the 2  ms cdf - n catalog ( out of 503 total ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; x - ray spectral analyses of a few fainter x - ray sources are presented in @xcite and @xcite . with 0.58.0  kev fluxes ranging from @xmath19 to @xmath20  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath16 ,",
    "these sources are characteristic of the population which comprises the bulk of the x - ray background below 10  kev .",
    "seventy - two ( @xmath14  53% ) of the sources in the sample have spectroscopic redshifts ( see figure  [ fig : zdist ] ) ; among these , nearly all have x - ray luminosities consistent with agn . based on their spectral slopes and x - ray - to - optical flux ratios ( i.e. , most have @xmath21 ) ,",
    "the remaining unidentified sources are likely to be optically faint , obscured agn at @xmath223 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus almost all of the 136 sources appear to be agn .",
    "since the unidentified sources comprise almost half of the sample and may play an important role in the overall intrinsic column density and luminosity distributions , we have placed the unidentified sources at @xmath7 ( i.e. , the likely lower redshift bound for these sources ) .",
    "details of our spectral analysis procedure are given in @xcite .",
    "x - ray spectral fitting was performed using xspec ( v11.2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we initially fitted each source with a simple model ( hereafter model  1 ) consisting of fixed galactic photoelectric absorption ( @xmath23  @xmath3 toward the cdf - n ) , a varying intrinsic @xmath8 ( using the redshift if known ) , and a power law with varying photon index ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "approximately 75% of the sources are acceptably fit by model  1 [ @xmath25 .",
    "example spectra of two typical agn are shown in figure  [ fig : example_spectra ] .",
    "the model  1 fits yield median spectral parameters of @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xmath3 for our 136 sources , with large dispersions for both parameters ; the overall distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : nh_vs_gamma ] .",
    "note that the changes in these parameters are much less than their dispersions if we limit ourselves to the sources with redshifts ( i.e. , @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xmath3 ) or with @xmath28 500 counts ( i.e. , @xmath29 and @xmath30  @xmath3 ) .",
    "the @xmath31 distribution has a peak at @xmath32  galactic , and very few objects ( @xmath33% ) have @xmath34  @xmath3 .",
    "the 27 optically identified broad - line agn ( blagn ) appear to trace the same @xmath8 distribution as the overall sample .",
    "the typical photon indices found for the cdf - n agn are @xmath350.3 lower than the canonical intrinsic x - ray spectral slope value of agn ( e.g. , @xmath362.0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting the presence of additional spectral complexity ( e.g. , reflection , complex intrinsic absorption , partial covering ) .",
    "this fact is strengthened somewhat by the systematic residuals ( e.g. , soft excesses , spectral curvature ) seen in several objects .",
    "detailed modeling of this complexity is underway but is beyond the scope of this paper . as a simple test of how the @xmath8 and @xmath37 distributions could be affected by spectral complexity , we fitted the data with a model identical to model  1 , but with the photon index fixed to @xmath38 ( i.e. , close to the canonical intrinsic slope found locally ; hereafter model  2 ) .",
    "we find that fewer sources are acceptably fit [ @xmath25 with model  2 ( @xmath14  60% ) and many sources have strong systematic residuals ; this again suggests that there is spectral complexity .",
    "the median intrinsic absorption is @xmath39  @xmath3 and the median differences between intrinsic @xmath8 and @xmath37 for model  1 and model  2 are factors of 2.5 and 0.5 , respectively ( see figure  [ fig : nh_vs_lx ] ) .",
    "the decrease in x - ray luminosity found for model  2 is due in part to @xmath40-correction differences from the free versus fixed photon indices ; note that the intrinsic x - ray luminosity could increase substantially if reflection and scattering were actually taken into account .",
    "x - ray background synthesis models and x - ray spectral analyses of nearby sources both suggest that a large fraction of agn may be compton thick ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with direct emission observable only above rest - frame energies of @xmath17  10  kev ( if at all ) . below this energy",
    ", these agn can only be detected via their faint reflected or scattered emission , typically in the form of extremely flat spectral slopes and large equivalent - width ( ew ) emission lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we can place constraints on the existence of such objects at faint x - ray fluxes by searching for these features in our sample .",
    "for instance , 10 of the 136 agn ( @xmath147% ) exhibit obvious fe  k@xmath10 emission - line features with ew  @xmath41  0.11.3  kev .",
    "the emission lines appear to be typically a combination of narrow 6.4 , 6.7 , and 6.96  kev emission lines , although a few objects exhibit a possible broad wing redward of the 6.4  kev line .",
    "example spectra of two typical cdf - n emission - line agn are shown in figure  [ fig : line_example_spectra ] .",
    "two of the emission - line sources are potentially compton - thick agn with @xmath11 and ew  @xmath41  0.60.7  kev .",
    "we can place further constraints on the number of reflection - dominated compton - thick agn in two ways .",
    "first , only 11 of the 136 sources have measured photon indices @xmath11 , suggesting that few objects in the sample show the signature of pure reflection that is characteristic of reflection - dominated compton - thick agn .",
    "second , by modeling a gaussian component to the source spectrum ( @xmath42  kev , @xmath43  kev ) , we can place upper limits on the fe k@xmath10 ews for the 72 objects with redshifts .",
    "the range of fe k@xmath10 ew upper limits is 0.12.9  kev ( i.e. , consistent with local seyferts ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that many sources may have emission lines which are still individually undetectable with the current data .",
    "however , only 8 of the 72 sources ( @xmath1411% ) have 90% confidence ew upper limits above 1  kev , and , of these , none has a measured photon index @xmath44 . given that @xmath1750% of all known compton - thick sources have @xmath44 and ew  @xmath28  1  kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that large ews can also arise from anisotropic ionizing radiation or lags between continuum and line variability , the true number of compton - thick agn among our sample is likely to be small .",
    "the 20 individual cdf - n observations span @xmath45 months and offer an unprecedented probe of x - ray variability in distant agn . using kolmogorov - smirnov ( single observations , second - to - day timescales ) and @xmath46 ( multiple observations , day - to - year timescales ) tests , we find that @xmath17  55% and @xmath17  60% of the 136 sources are variable at greater than 99% confidence , respectively .",
    "these fractions increase significantly when we restrict ourselves to the 61 objects with @xmath47 counts ( i.e. , @xmath17  80% and @xmath17  90% , respectively ) or the 27 objects with broad lines ( i.e. , @xmath17  66% and @xmath17  92% , respectively )",
    ". the latter results are most likely a result of better photon statistics alone , suggesting that the vast majority of the cdf - n agn are variable .",
    "we detect maximum and median variability amplitudes in the vignetting - corrected count rate of @xmath14  7.8 and @xmath14  1.9 , respectively , with 3 ( 15 ) sources having maximum variability amplitudes larger than 5 ( 3 ) .",
    "the variability properties of these moderate - luminosity agn are consistent with local studies of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
