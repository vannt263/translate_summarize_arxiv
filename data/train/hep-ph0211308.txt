    "the cause of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( that generates masses for the weak gauge bosons @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and the origin of the flavor symmetry breaking ( that generates mass spectrum for quarks and leptons ) are great mysteries in the elementary particle physics . in the standard model ( sm ) , both symmetry breaking mechanisms are explained by introducing a scalar iso - doublet field which includes a physical scalar state , i.e. , the higgs boson ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath10 bosons obtain their masses through the higgs mechanism , and the fermions gain their masses via the yukawa interaction .    the present precision data have shown an excellent agreement with the prediction of the sm @xcite .",
    "it also suggests the higgs boson to be light , with a central value @xmath13gev ( below the lep2 direct search bound which requires @xmath14gev @xcite ) and a 95%c.l .",
    "upper limit on higgs boson mass to be 193 gev @xcite .",
    "however , a more close examination reveals that the present data only strongly constrains the couplings of the gauge bosons with the fermions ( except top quark ) as well as those of the triple gauge boson vertices , but says little about the interaction of higgs boson with gauge bosons and fermions . with the data coming from the current run - ii of the fermilab tevatron collider , the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and future linear colliders ( lc s ) , more precise tests of these sectors of the sm become possible .",
    "for example , at the lc , the higgs boson can be produced via the processes @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite , and the @xmath17 and @xmath18 couplings can be determined to a few percent from the precise measurement of the above production cross sections @xcite . furthermore , the yukawa couplings of the higgs boson to fermions can be determined from measuring the decay branching ratios of the higgs boson .    to test the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) sector of the sm , not only should the couplings of the higgs boson to gauge bosons and fermions be measured , but also the self - coupling of the higgs boson which originates from the higgs potential .",
    "unfortunately , at the lhc , it would be extremely difficult to measure the sm higgs boson self - couplings , either the trilinear coupling @xmath19 or the quartic coupling @xmath20 @xcite . at the lc",
    ", the trilinear coupling @xmath21 can be measured via the higgs boson pair production in @xmath22 and @xmath23 , if the higgs boson is not too heavy @xcite .",
    "it is expected that at a @xmath24gev ( @xmath25tev ) @xmath26 collider with an integrated luminosity of @xmath27 ab@xmath28 ( @xmath29 ab@xmath28 ) , @xmath21 can be measured to about 20% ( 7% ) accuracy for the higgs boson mass around @xmath30 gev @xcite .",
    "the expectation for such a precise measurement motivates to study radiative correction to the higgs self - couplings . in the sm ,",
    "the one - loop contribution of the heavy quarks is substantial due to their non - decoupling property , especially its leading effect grows as the quartic power of the top - quark mass in the large mass limit .",
    "the precise measurement of the self - coupling at the lc also makes it possible to test extended higgs models , which have different structures of the higgs potential from the sm @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we discuss quantum corrections to the self - coupling of the lightest cp - even higgs boson in the two - higgs - doublet model ( thdm ) @xcite .",
    "the thdm is the simplest model of extended higgs sectors , and its higgs potential has a rich structure for various physics motivations .",
    "the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is a special case of the _ weakly coupled _",
    "thdm @xcite .",
    "some models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking also yield the thdm as their low - energy effective theory @xcite , in which the higgs self - couplings are relatively strong .",
    "the tree - level @xmath19 coupling in the thdm generally differs from that predicted by the sm , depending on the other parameters of the model @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the one - loop effects on the higgs self - couplings in the mssm have been calculated , and their decoupling property has also been studied in detail . as to be shown below , in contrast to the mssm , it can happen that the heavy mass effects in a general thdm do not decouple . to illustrate this point",

    "the mass of the heavier higgs bosons contributing in the loop diagrams appears in the effective @xmath19 coupling .",
    "we find that even when the higgs couplings to gauge bosons and fermions are almost sm - like , the deviation in the @xmath19 self - coupling from the sm prediction can be at the order of @xmath31 due to the non - decoupling effects of the additional heavier higgs bosons in loops .",
    "before proceeding to the discussion of the results for the thdm , it would be instructive to see how the leading one - loop effects appear in the @xmath19 coupling in the sm .",
    "the tree - level trilinear higgs coupling is expressed in terms of the higgs boson mass ( @xmath32 ) and the vacuum expectation value ( @xmath33 ) by @xmath34 .",

    "( [ dec_hhh ] ) can contribute a large logarithmic term @xmath56 , they all cancel with each other in the sum so that the remaining leading contribution to @xmath57 is the constant @xmath58 term .",
    "the appearance of this non - vanishing @xmath58 term is a striking feature of the one - loop correction to the self - coupling constant .",
    "in contrast , the one - loop effective couplings of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) ( @xmath62 ) have non - decoupling power - like contributions of at most @xmath63 . therefore ,",
    "if a new heavy particle has the similar non - decoupling property to the top quark in some extension of the sm , its loop effect on the @xmath19 coupling can become important , because the quartic mass contribution is expected to make the correction large . in the following ,",
    "we examine this point in the context of the thdm .",
    "the higgs potential of the cp - conserving thdm is given by @xmath64 where we imposed a softly - broken discrete symmetry under the transformation of @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "we assume all the coupling constants and mass parameters to be real , so that there are eight real parameters in the potential ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "the discrete symmetry allows two types of the yukawa interaction , so called model i and model ii @xcite .",
    "the discrete symmetry ensures natural suppression of flavor changing neutral current processes .",

    "( [ typ_mass ] ) , there are two origins of the masses ; one is the soft - breaking scale @xmath72 , and another is the vacuum expectation value of the electroweak symmetry breaking @xmath33 .",
    "the origin of the mass determines the decoupling property of the heavy higgs bosons @xcite . when @xmath77 , @xmath78 is determined by @xmath72 , and is independent of @xmath74 .",
    "consequently , the loop effects of @xmath71 vanish in the large mass limit ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) because of the decoupling theorem-@xmath76 are given to be @xmath80 due to supersymmetry , where @xmath81 represent the electroweak gauge coupling constants . ] . on the other hand , when @xmath82 the large value of @xmath83 is realized by large coupling constants @xmath74 . in this case",

    "we have calculated the one - loop correction to the effective @xmath19 vertex function by the diagrammatic approach in the on - shell scheme . in this letter",
    ", we present the results of our calculations , and details of the calculation will be shown elsewhere @xcite . to simplify our discussion on the one - loop radiative corrections to the higgs self - coupling in the thdm",

    "( _ ii _ ) experimental data on the @xmath59 couplings ( @xmath62 ) and the the higgs decay branching ratios agree with their sm prediction in good accuracy .",

    "the leading contribution of the above result can also be obtained by using the effective potential method . as expected , the contribution from the top quark loop is the same as the sm prediction because the tree level coupling of the top quark to @xmath11 is identical to that in the sm when @xmath95 . similar to the top quark loop , the contribution from the higgs boson loops also grows as @xmath96 but with a suppression factor @xmath97 , where @xmath71 represents @xmath67 , @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , the higgs boson loop contributes an opposite sign to the top quark loop because the former is a boson loop and the latter is a fermion loop . because of the suppression factor @xmath97 , the maximum non - decoupling effect",
