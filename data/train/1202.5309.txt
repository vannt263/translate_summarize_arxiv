    "the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) collaboration has provided a new measurement of the igrb energy spectrum  @xcite with improved accuracy , covering the broad energy range from 200  mev to @xmath3  100  gev . however , the energy spectrum of the igrb is reported to be consistent with a power law , and thus provides little clue to the origin of this emission in the form of spectral features . as a result ,",
    "the contributions of individual source classes to the igrb are poorly constrained , severely limiting our ability to search for signals of new physics or to place constraints on emission from exotic sources .",
    "one way to tackle the problem is through population studies of resolved sources .",
    "gamma - ray source classes with resolved members , such as blazars and millisecond pulsars , are obvious candidate contributors to the igrb via emission from their yet unresolved members .",

    "@xcite reports that unresolved point sources contribute @xmath11% of the igrb intensity measured by  @xcite .",
    "as blazars constitute the vast majority of lat - detected sources , this is a good indicator of the expected unresolved blazar contribution , as well as a firm upper limit for sources that follow the measured source count distribution . in the following",
    "we use the terms blazars and unresolved sources interchangeably .",
    "another constraint , which has not yet been explored , is provided by the level of anisotropy of the igrb .",
    "recently the first measurement of the small - scale anisotropy of the igrb has been made  @xcite , while in the last few years predictions have been derived for the anisotropy of many gamma - ray source classes , including blazars and galaxy clusters  @xcite , millisecond pulsars  @xcite , star - forming galaxies  @xcite and dark matter annihilation and decay  @xcite .",
    "these source classes often produce similar energy spectra but very different anisotropies , suggesting that anisotropy analysis could be a powerful tool for distinguishing possible igrb contributors .    in this work ,",
    "for the first time we use the observed anisotropy information to constrain the properties of the source classes contributing to the igrb .",
    "we calculate the intensity and anisotropy produced by the unresolved members of a source population whose detected members follow a broken power - law @xmath0-@xmath1 ( such as the lat - detected blazars ) .",
    "we determine upper limits on the igrb anisotropy from non - blazar sources by subtracting the predicted angular power for the best - fit blazar @xmath0-@xmath1 from the total measured anisotropy in several energy bands  @xcite .",
    "we then allow the @xmath0-@xmath1 parameters to vary , and compare the predictions for this class of models with the measured igrb intensity  @xcite and anisotropy  @xcite to identify the range of @xmath0-@xmath1 parameters that are consistent with both measurements .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 of sources detected by the lat is compatible with a broken power law  @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the normalization , @xmath14 is the flux where the power law breaks , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the power - law slopes below and above the break , respectively .",

    ", @xmath5 denotes the integrated source flux in the 110  gev energy band .    from a given @xmath0-@xmath1 , the contribution to the igrb intensity from the unresolved sources",
    "can be estimated by integrating the distribution from the source detection threshold down to zero flux : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the flux sensitivity threshold for point source detection .",
    "we note that the source detection threshold can in principle depend on a variety of factors .",
    "of particular relevance for this study , due to the energy - dependent angular resolution of the lat , the value of @xmath23 for a given source depends on its spectral index . however , this _ spectral index bias _ is small in the 110  gev range ( see next section and  @xcite ) .",
    "we can thus use an effective @xmath23 as described in the next section .",
    "we also note that , concerning the predicted contributions to the igrb intensity and anisotropy , the extrapolation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 down to zero flux is not strictly necessary for the models we consider .",
    "since the contribution per logarithmic interval to the igrb intensity behaves like @xmath24 and , for @xmath25 ( as we consider here ) , peaks at @xmath14 which is close to the detection threshold , the result is insensitive to the exact behavior of the @xmath0-@xmath1 at very low fluxes and to the exact lower flux limit of the extrapolation .",
    "similar considerations apply to the igrb anisotropy contribution .",
    "the total number of sources , on the other hand , may be more sensitive to the extrapolation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 at low fluxes .",
    "however , this quantity is unobservable unless future instruments are able to resolve all of the igrb into sources , and , in any case , does not impact the results of the present analysis .",
    "fig.[fig : scatter ] shows the spectral index vs.  integrated flux above 100 mev ( left panel ) and above 1 gev ( right panel ) for the sources in the 1fgl catalog  @xcite located at a galactic latitude of @xmath26 .",
    "the plot clearly shows the strong spectral index bias present in the source fluxes above 100 mev . on the other hand",
    "it is also evident that the spectral index bias is absent or , at most , very weak when considering fluxes above 1 gev .",
    "since our analysis focuses on the energy range 1 - 10 gev , we adopt a single threshold independent of the spectral index .",
    "we can derive the flux threshold @xmath23 directly from fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] since the integrated flux of a source in the energy range 1 - 10 gev is , to very good approximation , equal to its flux integrated above 1 gev .",
    "we can see that no sources below a flux of @xmath27 @xmath7 s@xmath8 are detected , while the number of detected sources decreases abruptly below approximately @xmath28 @xmath7 s@xmath8 . in the following we thus adopt the threshold @xmath29",
    "@xmath7 s@xmath8 .    for comparison",
    ", we also perform an analytic calculation of the flux threshold as a function of the spectral index following the prescription given in appendix a of  @xcite . for this calculation",
    "we assume a spatially uniform background given by the average of the official fermi background model for @xmath26 .",
    "we assume an observation time of 11 months and a detection threshold test statistic ts=25 , appropriate for the 1fgl catalog described in @xcite .",
    "overall , the analytic calculation , shown as bold lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] , matches well the behavior of the observed source fluxes as a function of the spectral index .",
    "note that we do not implement the correction described in  @xcite to account for source confusion , so the analytic calculation slightly underestimates the detection threshold at high spectral indices ( very soft sources ) where this effect is more important , and indeed this is evident in fig .  [",
    "fig : scatter ] .    note that in the following we will compare theoretical predictions of igrb intensities integrated in the range 1 - 10 gev with the experimental measurement given in @xcite for which sources from a preliminary version of the 1fgl catalog based on 9 months of data were considered , instead of the final 1fgl source list .",
    "however , the differences between the two source lists is very small @xcite , thus we expect that the threshold we adopted is appropriate",
    ". furthermore , any small differences between the igrb intensities derived using the two catalogs are likely smaller than the igrb measurement error itself , which is dominated by systematic uncertainties in the effective area and the level of residual cosmic - ray contamination .",
    "the poisson term of the angular power spectrum of the sources , @xmath30 , can be calculated from the @xmath0-@xmath1 .",
    "it takes the same value at all multipoles and is given by @xmath31 this formula gives @xmath30 in the units appropriate for the angular power calculated from an intensity map , i.e. , units of intensity@xmath32 @xmath33 solid angle , where intensity is in units of the number of photons per area per time per solid angle .",

    "finally , as a technical remark , we emphasize that the use of the _ dimensionful _ intensity angular power , rather than the _ dimensionless _ fluctuation angular power , conveniently avoids the need to treat contamination of the anisotropy measurement by possible residual galactic diffuse emission or instrumental backgrounds .",

    "we calculate the predicted @xmath64 and @xmath30 from the corresponding @xmath0-@xmath1 function .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] we show the region of the @xmath67-@xmath1 parameter space in which blazars contribute 100% of the igrb intensity ( light blue ) and that in which they contribute 100% of the angular power ( dark yellow ) in the 110  gev energy band .",
    "the widths of these regions show the 68%  ( 1@xmath51 ) confidence level regions , reflecting the respective 1@xmath51 uncertainties in the measured @xmath30 and @xmath64 . above the light blue region ,",
    "blazars contribute less than 100% of the measured igrb intensity ; below this region , blazars overproduce the igrb intensity .",
    "similarly , above the dark yellow region blazars do not contribute the entirety of the measured angular power , whereas below this region they overproduce the anisotropy .",
    "we emphasize that the constraint from the anisotropy measurement is much stronger than that from the intensity measurement except for at very high values of @xmath15 .",
    "there is a region of parameter space in which blazars contribute 100% of the igrb intensity without exceeding the measured @xmath30 ; however , this region ( shown expanded in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : contours ] ) has a high break flux ( @xmath68  few  times  @xmath69@xmath7 s@xmath8 ) which is strongly incompatible with the break measured from the source count analysis .",
    "such a high break flux can be robustly excluded , as it would lie in the flux range where the source detection efficiency is close to 1 , and thus this kind of feature is unlikely to have been missed .",
    "taking the measured value of the break flux as an upper limit , we find that the contribution from blazars in the region allowed by @xmath70 can not be more than @xmath320% of the igrb mean intensity ( see labeled contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] ) , a value which is in agreement with the results of the source count analysis alone .",
    "we now ask `` how well do the parameters of the @xmath0-@xmath1 function inferred from @xmath55 agree with those found from the source count analysis ? ''",
    "the best - fit 1@xmath51 region of @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the blazar @xmath0-@xmath71 given in @xcite overlaps well with the 1@xmath51 region where blazars contribute 100% of @xmath70 .",
    "this is a non - trivial result , as the measured anisotropy and source count distribution are independent observables , determined from independent data analyses .",
    "note that the errors on the 110 gev @xmath0-@xmath1 parameters shown in the plot are taken directly from @xcite and are larger than the rescaled ones used in the previous section .    to further demonstrate how anisotropy data can be a powerful tool for distinguishing between multiple scenarios we test an alternative fit to the blazar @xmath0-@xmath1 obtained by stecker & venters  @xcite .",
    "a notable feature of this alternative fit is that it can account for @xmath360% of the igrb intensity in the 1 - 10  gev energy band .",
    "we have calculated @xmath30 from the @xmath0-@xmath1 of the stecker & venters model  @xcite and , using a threshold of @xmath72 @xmath7 s@xmath8 ( the same used in the rest of our analysis ) , obtain @xmath73 ( @xmath7 s@xmath8 sr@xmath8)@xmath32 sr ( the error reported on this prediction being likely an overestimate since it neglects the covariance of the parameters ) .",
    "this value is a factor of @xmath74 larger than the measured value , and is inconsistent with @xmath70 at @xmath75 .",
    "the anisotropy data thus strongly excludes this blazar model . in addition",
    ", we remark that the recent analysis of @xcite using the blazar model of @xcite reaches conclusions similar to those of the present study : those authors find that the measured igrb anisotropy places a strong constraint on the contribution of blazars to the intensity of the igrb , and that , assuming the model considered in that work , blazars can not contribute a substantial fraction of the igrb intensity .    comparing the measured anisotropy of the igrb and",
    "the predicted anisotropy from blazars leads to another important conclusion .",
    "since , for the best - fit source count distribution , blazars already account for @xmath76% of the observed anisotropy and , in intensity units , poisson angular power is additive , the remaining component ( or components ) making @xmath77% of the igrb intensity must contribute a low level of anisotropy in order to not overproduce the observed angular power .",
    "interestingly , this can be achieved quite naturally since some proposed contributors to the igrb , such as star - forming galaxies  @xcite , are expected to contribute negligibly to the anisotropy . on the other hand , this result implies strong constraints on source populations with large intrinsic anisotropy .",
    "we emphasize that the anisotropy and intensity contributions from a source population have different dependences on the source count distribution , and consequently they represent complementary observables which are sensitive to different source flux ranges .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : differential ] , which shows the cumulative contribution to the intensity and anisotropy above 100  mev as a function of source flux for the _ fermi _ lat best - fit @xmath0-@xmath1 parameters . from the relative flatness of the cumulative flux distribution below the threshold flux",
    ", it can be inferred that the igrb intensity contribution from unresolved blazars has only a weak dependence on the effective flux sensitivity .",
    "the cumulative anisotropy distribution , however , falls off more quickly below the threshold flux , so the anisotropy from unresolved sources is more strongly dependent on the sensitivity limit , and improved point source sensitivity is thus likely to have a more notable impact on the measured igrb anisotropy .",
    "-@xmath1 ( @xmath78   mev ) as a function of source flux .",
    "[ fig : differential],width=309 ]",
    "we briefly consider this analysis in other energy bands .",
    "the range above 10  gev is currently not suitable since the error on the measured @xmath30 is large and the @xmath0-@xmath1 is not well - constrained .",
    "a natural extension is thus to include the low - energy range down to 100  mev .",
    "however , spectral index bias is non - negligible in this energy band , and needs to be taken into account .",
    "equations  [ lognlogsflux ] and  [ lognlogscp ] in this case also need to be modified as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is now the source counts per unit flux and unit spectral index , and @xmath81 is detection threshold as a function of spectral index , which can be calculated as described in  [ sec : srcct ] .",
    "however , since there is not yet a measurement of the anisotropy below 1  gev to confront with the theoretical prediction , we leave a more detailed analysis of lower ( and higher ) energy bands to future work .",
    "clearly , a more detailed model of the sources is now required to predict the intensity and anisotropy of the igrb .",
    "the distribution in spectral indices now becomes important , while the calculation was previously insensitive to this property of the sources .",
    "also , while a simple broken power law was accurate enough to describe @xmath82 , more parameters are now required to describe the full @xmath80 .",
    "the formalism presented above can be applied to physically - motivated models of igrb contributors from population synthesis of source classes ( as in @xcite ) , where effective @xmath82 and @xmath80 in different energy bands is a prediction of the model itself , without the need to assume a parametric functional form .",
    "the @xmath30 prediction for the stecker & venters blazar model @xcite derived in this work is an example of such an application .",
    "we performed a joint analysis of the source count distribution of blazars and the measured anisotropy of the igrb in the energy range 110  gev , and find that a consistent picture emerges in which unresolved blazars account for only @xmath83% of the igrb intensity but @xmath76% of the angular power .",
    "the sources contributing the remaining @xmath77% of the igrb intensity are thus constrained to provide only a small contribution to the anisotropy .",
    "viable models of sources contributing to the igrb must satisfy the upper limits on their anisotropy that we reported in the last column of table  [ tab : ulims ] .",
    "we recommend that proposed models of sources contributing to the igrb should be provided in terms of effective @xmath82 ( and @xmath80 when appropriate ) in different energy bands in order to ease the use and application of these models by the scientific community , in particular for comparing with the measured igrb anisotropy , which represents a newly available observable .",
