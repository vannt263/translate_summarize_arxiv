    "<S> though reweighting fails to provide nnlo or nnll accuracy for the jet veto , for @xmath4 scales of practical relevance , the result agrees well with our central prediction . </S>",
    "<S> it is however harder to reliably estimate uncertainties in reweighting approaches than in direct calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we provide central results and uncertainties for the jet - veto efficiencies and 0-jet cross sections ( in pb ) with cuts ( in gev ) like those used by atlas and cms , and also for a larger @xmath43 value :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     interestingly , the @xmath111 results have reduced upper uncertainties , due perhaps to the smaller value of the nnll @xmath112 correction ( a large @xmath112 introduces significant @xmath109-scale dependence ) . </S>",
    "<S> the above results are without a rapidity cut on the jets ; the rapidity cuts used by atlas and cms lead only to small , @xmath113 , differences  @xcite .    for the 0-jet cross sections above , we used total cross sections at 7  tev and 8  tev of @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively  @xcite ( based on results including  @xcite ) and took their scale uncertainties to be uncorrelated with those of the efficiencies . </S>",
