    "cooperative scattering by large collections of resonant atoms has been studied extensively for many years adopting either a classical or a quantum description .",
    "often a quantum formalism is more convenient to describe the atom - light interaction .",
    "for instance , superradiant emission can be obtained when many independent atoms interact resonantly with photons , as studied in the seminal work by dicke @xcite . however",
    ", many features can well be described with classical models for the atoms with a polarizability and for the light field .",
    "many features of dicke superradiance can thus be explained using classical theory . as atoms appear to be excellent systems to study any possible deviation from classical many body features , it is of general interest to understand and to monitor cooperative effects , even at a classical level , in a cloud of atoms .",
    "new intriguing effects can arise , when fluctuations due to the coupling with the vacuum modes can no longer be described by a classical field approach and the atoms can also become entangled during the cooperative scattering . such cooperative scattering with atomic ensembles can appear in a number of experimental situations in free space @xcite or in cavities @xcite .    collective spontaneous emission at single excitation level",
    "@xcite has also been studied in resonant nuclear scattering of synchrotron radiation @xcite and has recently received growing interest with the study of single photon superradiance from @xmath0 two - level atoms prepared by the absorption of a single photon @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the photon is spontaneously emitted in the same direction as the incident field with a cooperative decay rate proportional to @xmath0 and inversely proportional to the size of the atomic cloud @xcite . in a series of theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies ,",
    "the authors have recently addressed the question of the quasi - resonant interaction of light with clouds of cold atoms , bridging the gap from single atom behavior , with granularity effects due to the discrete nature of the atomic distribution , to a ` mean - field ' regime , where a continuous density distribution is the relevant description and leads to cooperative effects . in these works ,",
    "the authors describe the collective atomic response under continuous excitation of a low intensity light field using an effective hamiltonian model valid in the linear regime . from it , the average radiation pressure force and the scattered intensity have been derived , observing the modification from the single - atom values due to cooperativity @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present an extended model based on a master equation in the single - excitation approximation . such model provides a more complete description of the linear regime , useful to investigate the distinctions between classical and quantum features , even though a complete description of quantum correlations in our system requires to take into account a larger number of excitations @xcite .",
    "in particular , we show that by a first - order perturbation expansion of the master equation we recover the previously adopted linear model from classical optics .",
    "we also derive an analytical expression showing the cooperative suppression of atomic excitation and the related fluorescence .",
    "this effect bears some common features with the dipole blockade studied in rydberg systems @xcite . in our case",
    "the long range @xmath1 dipole - dipole coupling is at the origin of this important suppression even for dilute clouds of cold atoms .",
    "we note that this suppression occurs in the linear optics regime and is thus not related to a photon blockade .",
    "the dynamics of a system of atoms driven by an external laser beam and undergoing cooperative re - emission into vacuum modes ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) can be described by a master equation approach @xcite .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath0 two - level atoms with transition frequency @xmath2 , positions @xmath3 and excited decay time @xmath4 .",

    "we have assumed the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) in the first term accounting for the interaction with the external laser , but not in the second term : there , the coupling between atoms and vacuum field modes is described in the scalar light approximation , where near field and polarization effects are neglected , since we are considering dilute clouds , with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 the system size ) .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the spontaneous emission properties can be conveniently described by a reduced master equation for the atomic system in the born - markov approximation , given by @xmath23\\nonumber\\\\     & & - i\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j\\neq      i}\\delta_{ij}[s^{i}_{+}s^{j}_{-},\\rho]\\nonumber\\\\     & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j}\\gamma_{ij }      \\left\\ {      2s^{j}_{-}\\rho s^{i}_{+}-s^{i}_{+}s^{j}_{-}\\rho-\\rho s^{i}_{+}s^{j}_{- }      \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the first term in the master equation ( [ me ] ) describes the interaction with the external laser .",
    "the second term describes the dipole - dipole interactions and arises from the virtual photon exchange between pairs of atoms .",
    "it becomes especially important at small interatomic distances , it is responsible for the collective lamb shift @xcite and plays an important role in the subradiant emission @xcite . finally , the third term of eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) describes the cooperative emission .",
    "the markov approximation ignores retardation effects and takes the long time limit , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "hence , it requires that the system size is not too large , such that one photon travels through the atomic cloud faster than the characteristic cooperative emission time .",
    "the rwa approximation adopted in the present model requires more subtle arguments . as discussed in @xcite , when applied to the second term of the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , the rwa consists in ignoring anti - resonant terms like @xmath29 and @xmath30 which correspond to simultaneous creation or annihilation of a photon and atomic excitation ( i.e. virtual transition ) .",
    "these terms are responsible of the shift of the ground state which contributes to the terms @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) .",
    "however , the master equation ( [ me ] ) has been obtained in @xcite from the complete hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) including the anti - resonant term , and making the rwa only on the master equation , neglecting the rapidly oscillating terms like @xmath32 .",
    "hence , eq . ( [ me ] )",
    "obtained by making the rwa on the master equation rather than on the hamiltonian does include the shift of the ground state .",
    "these remarks make clear that rwa on the hamiltonian is not the same as rwa on the master equation and that one should make rwa on the final equations of motion . since the counter - rotating terms as @xmath33 are not important because @xmath34 , eq . ( [ me ] ) provides an accurate description of the interaction , including both the contributions of the real and virtual transitions to the frequency shift .",
    "the master equation ( [ me ] ) has been used to describe , in the absence of the driving laser , the superradiant and subradiant decays from excited atoms . for a system confined in a volume",
    "whose size is much smaller than the radiation wavelength , and neglecting the dipole - dipole interaction terms @xmath31 , dicke @xcite introduced the angular momentum states @xmath35 , with @xmath36 . if the system is initially prepared in a symmetric ( superradiant ) state ( with e.g. @xmath37 ) , without any coupling between this state and the antisymmetric ( subradiant ) states .",
    "note however that the presence of dipole - dipole interactions may induce coupling with subradiant states @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the presence of the driving laser provides the atom excitation which subsequently scatters and/or decays cooperatively .",
    "if the driving field is sufficiently weak or largely detuned from the atomic resonance , we can assume that the atomic system is weakly excited , with at most one atom out of @xmath0 excited .",
    "if the atoms are organized in a symmetric state , the decay rate is @xmath38 .",
    "recently , it has been shown that an extended system of size @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the light wavelength ) containing a single excited atom among @xmath0 and prepared in the timed dicke state @xcite @xmath41 decays with a rate @xmath42 . also , an external field @xmath43 drives the system mainly in a steady state of the form @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the resonant optical thickness along the propagation direction @xmath46 of the driving laser and @xmath47 is the atomic density . however , a small fraction of the initial ground state is still coupled to the subradiant states , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the previous works studying cooperative scattering by weakly excited atoms were based on a effective hamiltonian model and brought us to a description equivalent to that of @xmath0 classical linear dipoles driven by the external field @xcite . here , we go beyond the linear optics approximation using a master equation approach , still restricted to a single excitation .",
    "this restriction would be limited to the case of weak driving field , but may have a larger validity , for instance for rydberg s atoms where some kind of blockade is provided @xcite .    by projecting eq .",

    "it is important to notice that , even if the collective atomic state @xmath72 is entangled , the knowledge of only the probability amplitudes @xmath73 obtained from the linear equations ( [ beta ] ) is not by itself sufficient to detect entanglement , due to its classical nature .",
    "conversely , entanglement could be observable in the solution of the master equation , even restricted to a single - excitation , since it contains correlations between atoms , and in particular between the ground state and the excited states .",

    "<S> we present a quantum description of the process in terms of a master equation for the atomic density matrix in the scalar , born - markov approximations , reduced to the single - excitation limit . from a perturbative approach for weak incident field , we derive from the master equation the effective hamiltonian , valid in the linear regime . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the validity of the driven timed dicke ansatz and of a partial wave expansion for different optical thicknesses and we give analytical expressions for the scattered intensity and the radiation pressure force on the center of mass . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive an expression for collective suppression of the atomic excitation and the scattered light by these correlated dipoles . </S>"
