    "the barred spiral galaxy ngc 1097 was the first example of a liner ( low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ; heckman 1980 ) to display broad , double - peaked balmer lines .",
    "the double - peaked h@xmath0 line ( fwhm @xmath1 ) was discovered by storchi - bergmann , baldwin , & wilson ( 1993 ; hereafter sb93 ) after a careful subtraction of the starlight from the nuclear spectrum . the broad line was not easily recognizable in the original spectrum because its contrast against the continuum from the underlying stellar population was fairly low .",
    "this discovery was followed by other examples , all of them in _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ spectra taken through narrow apertures in which starlight from the host galaxy is largely excluded .",
    "these examples include m81 ( bower et al .",
    "1996 ) , ngc  4203 ( shields et al .",
    "2000 ) , ngc  4450 ( ho et al . 2000 ) , and ngc  4579 ( barth et al . 2000 ) .",
    "comparison of the double - peaked h@xmath0 spectrum of ngc  1097 with earlier observations , as well as the later evolution of the double - peaked profile , led to the conclusion that the broad balmer lines were associated with a transient event ( e.g. , sb93 , eracleous et al .",
    "1995 ; storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ; hereafter sb95 , sb97 ) , presumably an episode of mass accretion onto the nuclear supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "the recent findings of a proportionality between the masses of galactic bulges and that of the smbh in galaxies that are close enough to allow the smbh s detection via stellar kinematics ( e.g. , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) supports their presence in the nucleus of most present - day galaxies .",
    "such a smbh will eventually accrete mass , such as via the capture of a star passing closer to the black hole than its tidal radius .",
    "if the smbh has a mass smaller than @xmath2 , a solar - mass star will be tidally disrupted before it is accreted , leading to the formation of an accretion disk or ring . as argued by sb95 and sb97 ,",
    "such a process is the preferred interpretation for the double - peaked lines of ngc  1097 and may also be applicable to some of the other liners mentioned above .",
    "it is thus possible that we have begun to witness such tidal disruption events , which have long been predicted by theory ( see review by rees 1988 ) .",
    "monitoring the variability of the double - peaked profiles provides useful constraints on the above scenario .",
    "therefore , we have been following the evolution of the h@xmath0 profile of ngc  1097 since it was first discovered in 1991 .",
    "in this paper we present the result of 11 years of monitoring and use the profile observations to constrain and refine scenarios for their origin , such as the precessing elliptical ring suggested by eracleous et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and sb95 .",
    "in  2 we describe the observations and analysis of the data , in  3 we present the results , and in  4 we discuss their interpretation and present two possible accretion disk models to reproduce the profile variations .",
    "we explore in  5 the significance of our findings and compare them with those for other objects .",
    "the conclusions of this work are presented in  6 .",
    "we observed the nuclear spectrum of ngc  1097 from 1991 to 2002 , up to several times a year , using mostly the ctio 4 m blanco and 1.5 m telescopes , and the kpno 2.1 m telescope .",
    "we also obtained a few spectra with the keck ii , lick 3 m , mdm 2.4 m , and eso ntt telescopes .",
    "the log of observations is given in table [ tbl-1 ] , where we also list the slit and extraction window widths .",
    "the first observations ( sb93 , sb95 , sb97 ) were obtained through a 2  slit and an extraction window of 4 .",
    "we later used a narrower slit of 15 for the observations with the large telescopes ( 3.6 m and 4 m ) in order to improve the contrast between the double - peaked profile and the starlight spectrum , but keeping it wide enough to avoid spurious variations due to seeing differences .",
    "we have also kept the extraction window large enough to allow the normalization of the double - peaked broad line flux using the fluxes of the narrow emission lines , as discussed below .    in order to isolate the double - peaked profile , we subtracted the contribution of the stellar population , as described in sb93 , sb95 , and sb97 . in the case of the observations with the blanco and ntt telescopes ,",
    "the stellar population spectrum was extracted from windows adjacent to the nuclear window , typically from regions between 3  and 6  from the nucleus .",
    "the nuclear spectrum is redder than that of the stellar population at these windows .",
    "attributing the difference in color to reddening by dust , we estimate a value of @xmath3 mag .",
    "we have thus reddened the stellar population spectra accordingly and normalized them to the flux of the continuum in the nuclear spectrum .",
    "in addition , we have excized the residual narrow - line emission from the stellar population spectra ( using as a reference spectra of disk galaxies free of emission lines ) , and have subtracted it from the nuclear spectrum .",
    "the spectra obtained with the smaller telescopes ( ctio 1.5 m and kpno 2.1 m ) have a signal - to - noise ratio too low outside the nucleus to allow the extraction of a population template ; for these we used the starlight spectra extracted from the ctio 4 m observations to subtract the stellar population contribution .",
    "the same was done for the keck and mdm spectra .",
    "the process of starlight subtraction is more important in the most recent spectra because the double - peaked line is fading ( see discussion below ) and its contrast to the stellar population spectrum is decreasing .",
    "thus a careful match of the stellar population spectrum is necessary before the subtraction .",
    "the last step was to normalize the broad - line flux , which we have done using the fluxes of the narrow emission lines h@xmath0 , [ ] @xmath46548 , 6584 , and [ ] @xmath46717 , 6731 , under the assumption that they have not varied during the 11 years of observations .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , considering that the average extraction windows correspond to @xmath5 pc@xmath6 at the galaxy . for the normalization we used as reference the spectrum of 1996 jan .",
    "24 , as follows . for each spectrum",
    "we determined the average ratio of the [ n  ii ] + h@xmath0(narrow ) and [ s  ii ] fluxes with respect to the 1996 jan .",
    "24 spectrum and multiplied the spectrum by this average ratio .",
    "this scaling factor is listed for each spectrum in the last column of table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the success of this procedure is illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] , which shows that profiles obtained approximately at the same epoch ( within two months of each other ) using different telescopes match each other very well after the above normalization .",
    "this result also shows that the small differences in apertures of the different spectra does not significantly affect the normalization .",
    "the keck spectra are the only exceptions , as we had to `` re - normalize '' them to @xmath780% of the resulting flux after the normalization described above , to allow an agreement with the spectra obtained at approximately the same epoch with the other large telescopes .",
    "we attribute this result to the narrower slit used in the keck spectra ( @xmath8 ) , suggesting that the narrow - line emission extends beyond 1  although not much more , as the normalization works for the larger apertures .",
    "the scaling factors listed in the last column of table [ tbl-1 ] for the keck spectra are already corrected for this additional normalization .",
    "after normalization , figure [ fig1 ] shows that there is reasonable agreement between the ctio 4 m and kpno 2.1 m spectra of 1997 sep .",
    "there is excellent agreement between the spectra with the best signal - to - noise ratios : keck ( thin continuous line ; epochs 1998 jan . and 1999 jan . ) and ctio 4 m ( thick continuous lines ; epochs 1998 feb . and 1998 dec . ) . in comparison , the mdm spectrum of 1998 dec .",
    "shows a broad dip around 6530    which is not present in the keck and ctio spectra .",
    "there is also good agreement between the keck spectra of 2000 oct . and the kpno 2.1 m spectra of 2000 sep .",
    "the spectra obtained with the ctio 1.5 m have the poorest signal - to - noise ratios : the profile from 1998 jan . has very little flux and is not compatible with the profiles measured both with the keck and ctio 4 m at approximately the same epoch . on the other hand the 1.5 m profile of 1998 oct .",
    "agrees with that of the kpno one of 1998 sep . and with the ctio 4 m one of 1998 dec .",
    "on the basis of figure [ fig1 ] we conclude that we should give more weight in our analysis to the results based on the keck , ctio 4 m , and ntt 3.6 m spectra relative to the ones obtained with the smaller telescopes .",
    "this figure also illustrates that changes in the shape of the double - peaked profiles seem to occur on time scales longer than a few ( @xmath7 34 ) months .",
    "in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] we show a sequence of selected h@xmath0 profiles , from 1991 nov . 2 to 2002 oct . 10 .",
    "our criteria for the selection was to obtain the most complete time coverage using the available data , but using spectra having the highest signal - to - noise ratios in cases of multiple spectra at a given epoch , as discussed above .    during the evolution of the double - peaked h@xmath0 profile shown in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ]",
    ", the most noticeable changes occur in the relative strengths of the blue and red peaks .",
    "the profile starts with the red peak stronger than the blue in 1991 nov . and evolves to similar strengths of the two peaks in 1994 jan .",
    ", then to the blue peak stronger than the red in 1996 jan .",
    "the spectrum of 1997 sep . shows again the red peak stronger than the blue , then the two peaks show similar strengths by mid 1998 , and then the blue peak is stronger than the red by 1999 . in the observation of 2001 sep .",
    "the blue and red peaks have similar strengths , and in 2002 oct .",
    "the blue peak is stronger again .",
    "another important change that could only be noticed after accumulating data over so many years is a _ decrease of the broad - line flux at the same time as the blue and red peaks are moving progressively farther apart _ , as indicated by the measurements below .    in order to quantify the observed variations , we measured the wavelengths of the blue and red peaks , their peak flux densities , and the flux of the broad line , which we list in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the wavelengths of the blue and red peaks ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and corresponding peak flux densities ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) were obtained by fitting gaussians separately to the blue and red peaks of the profiles and measuring the central wavelengths and peak fluxes .",
    "these measurements were only possible in the large - telescope spectra , as the fits to the blue and red peaks did not consistently converge to a unique central wavelength in spectra with low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the flux of the broad line ( @xmath13 ) was measured by integrating the flux of the broad plus the narrow emission lines and then subtracting the fluxes of the narrow lines .",
    "uncertainties in the wavelengths and fluxes were estimated by repeating the fits several times after changing by a few angstroms the limits of the windows used to fit the gaussians and to measure the broad - line flux .",
    "the resulting average uncertainties are @xmath14    for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath15 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath16 for @xmath13 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the temporal variations of the blue and red peak velocities ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , obtained from @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the average wavelength of the narrow h@xmath0 line as reference ( 6591.7   ) , as well as the temporal variation of @xmath19 and of @xmath13 .",
    "we observe a blueshift of the blue peak from @xmath20 in the first years to @xmath21 in 2001 , and a redshift of the red peak from @xmath22 to @xmath23 over the same period .",
    "the resulting @xmath19 increases from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we show the temporal variation of @xmath26 .",
    "the continued variation of @xmath26 and , in particular , the strong red peak observed in 1997 sep . still support the origin of the profile in an accretion disk that is not axisymmetric .",
    "the asymmetry could be the result of an eccentricity ( e.g. , eracleous et al .",
    "1995 ; sb95 ) , or a circular disk with a disturbance , such as a bright spot ( newman et al . 1997",
    "; zheng , veilleux , & grandi 1991 ) or spiral arm ( e.g. , chakrabarti & wiita 1993 ; gilbert et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the precession of the elliptical disk or of the disturbance in the circular disk would be the origin of the variation of @xmath26 with time .",
    "the increasing separation of the blue and red peaks (  3 ) indicates that the bulk of the broad - line emission is coming from regions of successively larger velocities . in the accretion disk scenario",
    ", this means that the bulk of emission is coming from successively smaller radii .",
    "the above result could suggest at first glance that we are witnessing the infall of matter toward the smbh .",
    "unfortunately , this seems not to be possible over ten years of observations .",
    "a noticeable decrease in radius should occur in the viscous time scale , which should be larger than 10@xmath27 years in the case of ngc  1097 ( frank , king , & raine 1992 , p. 99 , using the black hole mass obtained in sec .",
    "[ s_mass ] ) .",
    "an alternative possibility is borne out by the observation that , at the same time that the profile is getting broader , the line flux is decreasing ( in 2001 sep .",
    "the broad h@xmath0 flux is @xmath71/3 of the flux of 1991 nov . ) , which suggests that the ionizing source is getting dimmer .",
    "thus , a more plausible interpretation is that the dimming of the ionizing source is causing the region of maximum emission to come closer to the center , to regions of larger velocities and thus giving rise to broader profiles .",
    "inspection of figure [ fig4 ] shows that there seems indeed to be an inverse correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath13 , not only as a general trend along the 11 years covered by the observations , but also from epoch to epoch .",
    "for example , in 1996 jan .",
    "the flux of the line showed an increase relative to the two previous epochs , while @xmath19 decreased .",
    "the same seems to have happened in sep.oct .",
    "this inverse correlation can be better observed in figure [ fig6 ] , where we plot @xmath19 against @xmath13 .",
    "the above effect ( the inverse correlation between the ionizing flux and width of the profile ) has been previously discussed by dumont & collin - souffrin ( 1990 ) .",
    "these authors explain the existence of a `` radius for maximum emission '' or `` saturation radius '' as follows . in the line - emitting region of the accretion disk",
    "there are two effects contributing to the line intensity : the increase of the emitting surface with distance from the center , and the decrease of the intensity of ionizing radiation with radius .",
    "the ionizing flux can become quite high close to the center , leading to ionization of the disk and saturation of the line emission ( cooling is mainly due to free - bound and free - free processes and not to lines ) . the radius at which this saturation sets in is the radius of maximum emission .    finally , we notice that in figure [ fig4 ] , the velocity of the blue peak shows a steeper variation ( blueshift ) than that of the red peak ( redshift ) , implying a net blueshift of the center between the two peaks of @xmath28 between 1991 nov . and 2001 sep .",
    "one possibility is that this blueshift is due to a wind originating in the disk , which would be consistent with observations of fe  ii absorption lines in a recent _ hst _ spectrum of ngc  1097 ( eracleous 2002 ) which indicate the presence of an outflow .    with these considerations in mind ,",
    "we have tried to fit the variable line profiles with two different models , as we describe in detail below .",
    "both models rely on a non - axisymmetric disk structure and its precession to reproduce the changes in the relative strengths of the two peaks .",
    "however , this mechanism can not explain the increasing separation of the two peaks .",
    "the latter effect requires us to change the radius of maximum line emission in the disk by adjusting the prescription for the disk emissivity .      in eracleous et al .",
    "( 1995 ) we showed that an elliptical accretion ring model could reproduce the broad double - peaked h@xmath0 profile of ngc  1097 , as observed in 1991 nov . after following the variations of the line profile from 1991 to 1996 ( sb97 )",
    ", we developed the model further so that the plane of the ring was inclined at @xmath29 to the line of sight , and its line - emitting part corresponded to a range of pericenter distances between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is expressed in units of the gravitational radius @xmath33 .",
    "the ring was circular up to a radius @xmath34 , and from there the eccentricity increased linearly from @xmath35 to 0.45 .",
    "the ring had a broadening parameter @xmath36 and an emissivity varying as @xmath37 .",
    "the variation of the observed line profiles from 1991 to 1996 were reproduced by the precession of the ring with a period of of 25 years , which led to an estimate of the central black hole mass of @xmath38 .",
    "we tried to use the same elliptical ring model to reproduce all the double - peaked h@xmath0 profiles observed from 1991 to 2002 , by changing only the orientation angle , @xmath39 , under the assumption that the precession continued .",
    "however , we were not able to reproduce the line profiles observed after 1996 ; continued precession alone could explain the variation in the relative heights of the two peaks , but not the observed velocity shifts of the blue and red peaks .",
    "after exploring the effect of other parameters on the shape of the line profile , we found that only changes in the inner pericenter distance of the ring ( from @xmath40 to 450 ) could lead to the observed increase in the separation of the two peaks , @xmath41 .",
    "such a dramatic change in the physical location of a given volume of gas could not occur on a time scale of 5 years , however , as we noted in the previous section .",
    "rather , the emission properties of the ring must have changed so that the radius of maximum emission became smaller .",
    "therefore , to produce a self - consistent and physically plausible scenario for the entire set of observations , we were led to revise the model parameters .",
    "this revision represents a refinement of earlier models , which is possible only after following the variability of the line profile over a baseline of 10 years .",
    "we now propose that the ring has always had a smaller inner radius of @xmath42 ( and now resembles a disk more than a ring ) , and that the increasing width of the profile is due to a change in emissivity such that , in more recent epochs , the inner regions of the disk make a more significant relative contribution to the total line emission .",
    "this picture is also consistent with the observational result that the flux of the broad line is decreasing , as discussed above .    to explain the increasing separation between the two peaks , we experimented with several emissivity laws .",
    "we found that we could best reproduce the observations with a broken power law , such that inside a radius @xmath43 the power - law index is @xmath44 and outside this radius @xmath45 .",
    "this means that the emissivity _ increases _ with radius from @xmath46 to @xmath43 and then _ decreases _ with radius beyond @xmath43 .",
    "these @xmath47 values are also physically motivated : in the `` saturation '' region , the increase in emissivity is due to the increase in the area of the ring , while beyond @xmath43 , the decrease can be understood as due to the radiation field dropping off as @xmath48 and the increase of the emitting area as @xmath49 .    in this parameterization of the disk emissivity , varying the `` break radius '' @xmath43 allows us to reproduce the shifts of the blue and red peaks . in particular , allowing the `` break radius '' to decrease with time shifts the region of maximum emission closer to the center and results in an increase in the separation between the two peaks . at the same time , since the relative heights of the two peaks have continued to change , we allow the disk to precess ( as in sb97 ) .    to fit individual line profiles we fixed the inner and outer pericenter distances of the line - emitting disk to @xmath42 and @xmath50 ( respectively ) , the inclination angle to @xmath51 , and the broadening parameter to @xmath36 .",
    "the eccentricity was allowed to increase linearly with radius , from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "the emissivity of the disk ( @xmath54 ) was set to increase with radius in the inner disk ( i.e. , @xmath44 up to a radius @xmath43 ) and then decrease ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the orientation angle of the disk , @xmath39 , and the emissivity break radius , @xmath43 , were the only parameters allowed to vary to represent a precession of the disk and a decline in the illumination .",
    "we first searched for models that could reproduce the primary observables , namely the velocities and relative strengths of the two peaks .",
    "the best - fitting models resulting from the above procedure are compared with the observations in figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] , and the model parameters are summarized in table  [ tbl-3 ] .    in the last epochs , beginning in 1998 dec . , the fits of the model to the data show some improvement if we allow a small blueshift of the central wavelength of the profile ( @xmath710 ) relative to the wavelength of the narrow h@xmath0 line ( 6591.7     which we have so far adopted as the center of the broad line in the models ) .",
    "we show these improved fits as dotted lines in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "this blueshift of the broad line was already detected in the observed evolution of the blue and red peak velocities ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , and was discussed at the end of the previous subsection .",
    "the evolution of @xmath43 and @xmath39 are shown in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "there is very little change in @xmath43 until 1996 , but then in 1997 it begins to decrease , causing the relative contribution of the inner parts of the disk to become more important and producing the broadening of the profile .",
    "the orientation angle of the disk , represented by @xmath39 , shows a small range of values , @xmath55 , as listed in table  [ tbl-3 ] . noticing that changes in orientation by half a revolution result in very similar (",
    "although not identical ) model profiles , we have exploited this property in order to construct a series of models that would approximately represent a precession of the disk .",
    "the best compromise we could obtain between a good fit of the profiles and the precession scenario is illustrated in the bottom panel of figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "assuming that the precession rate of the disk is constant , we carry out a linear least - squares fit to the precession phase shown in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "we adopt a functional form given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the time in years , @xmath58 is an arbitrary zero point of the precession cycle , and @xmath59 is the precession period . the best fit , shown as a solid line in figure [ fig9 ] , yields @xmath60 and @xmath61  years , which implies that the disk has completed almost two revolutions since the epoch of the first observation as one would expect from the behavior of the peak strength ratio , @xmath26 , shown in figure [ fig5 ] . in figure [ fig10 ]",
    "we show a cartoon of the accretion disk in two epochs , the first ( 1991.8 ) and last ( 2001.7 ) fitted by the model , illustrating the change in the disk emissivity in 10 years .    in conclusion , we note that even though models that represent a smooth precession of the eccentric disk are preferable on physical grounds , they do not provide as good a description of the line profiles as the models whose parameters are listed in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "an alternative to the elliptical disk model is a model that invokes a non - axisymmetric perturbation of the emissivity of a circular disk .",
    "models of this type were applied to the variable h@xmath0 profile of 3c  390.3 by zheng , veilleux , & grandi ( 1991 ; a `` bright sector '' in the disk ) and by gilbert et al .",
    "( 1999 ; a single - arm spiral , inspired by the work of chakrabarti & wiita 1993 , 1994 ) . an important feature of these models is that the perturbation spans a relatively wide range in radius ( and projected velocity ) , which leads to a modulation in the relative strengths of the two peaks of the line profile without creating a `` third peak '' that moves across the profile .",
    "spiral arm models have additional appeal because spiral arms are known to exist in other astrophysical disks , such as the disks of spiral galaxies and the accretion disks of some cataclysmic variables ( e.g. , steeghs , harlaftis , & horne 1997 ; baptista & cataln 2000 ; patterson , halpern , & shambrook 1993 ) .",
    "we adopt the formulation of gilbert et al .",

    "superposed on the axisymmetric emissivity pattern ( @xmath64 ) there is an emissivity perturbation which has the form of a single spiral arm .",
    "we adopted a single - arm pattern after experimenting with patterns having two or more spiral arms .",
    "we found that two or more spiral arms could not reproduce the changing asymmetry of the h@xmath0 line profile of ngc  1097 , a conclusion also reached by gilbert et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for 3c  390.3 .",
    "the prescription for the total emissivity of the disk is given by @xmath65 + \\frac{a}{2}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{4\\ln 2}{\\delta^2 } ( 2\\pi-\\phi+\\psi_0)^2\\right ] \\right\\ } \\ ; , \\label{eq_spiral}\\ ] ] where the two exponentials represent the decay of the emissivity of the spiral arm with azimuthal distance on either side of the ridge line .",
    "the parameter @xmath66 represents the azimuthal width of the spiral arm ( fwhm ) , while the quantity @xmath67 is the azimuthal distance from the ridge of the spiral arm , which is defined by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the pitch angle and @xmath70 is the innermost radius of the spiral arm ( also used as a fiducial radius for normalization ; the spiral arm is set to begin at the outer radius of the disk , @xmath63 ) .",

    "to fit individual line profiles , we followed the procedure described in  [ s_ell ] .",
    "we found that we could keep the inner and outer radii of the disk at the values of the inner and outer pericenter distances of the elliptical disk model , namely @xmath42 and @xmath50 .",
    "we also kept the inclination at @xmath72 and the broadening parameter at @xmath36 .",

    "the variation of @xmath39 can explain the modulation of the relative strengths of the two peaks of the h@xmath0 line but not the increasing separation between them .",
    "therefore , in the spirit of the discussion of  [ interp ] , we allowed the emissivity power - law index to vary so as to shift the region of maximum emission to smaller radii .",

    "the spiral arm contrast , parameterized by @xmath71 , has decreased from 3 to 2 since the first observations , while @xmath47 has increased , favoring the emission of the inner part of the disk relative to that of the outer parts in the later epochs and producing the broadening of the profile .",
    "the @xmath39 values were constrained to allow a monotonic precession of the spiral pattern , as illustrated in figure [ fig13 ] , where we show how @xmath47 and @xmath39 evolve with time .",

    "the variation of the relative strengths of the two peaks of the h@xmath0 line of ngc  1097 appears to follow the same trend as in broad - line radio galaxies .",
    "examples include 3c  390.3 ( zheng , veilleux , & grandi 1991 ; gilbert et al .",
    "1999 ) , 3c  332 ( gilbert et al .",

    ", drifts in the peak wavelengths of double - peaked profiles are seldom observed .",
    "one case previously reported is that of the radio galaxy 3c  390.3 , for which gaskell ( 1996 ) , eracleous et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and gilbert et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found a drift in the velocity of the blue peak between 1970 and 1996 .",
    "but in 3c  390.3 , eracleous et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that the two peaks moved together , unlike what is observed in the case of ngc  1097 , in which the two peaks move apart from each other .    on the other hand , shapovalova et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , using observations of the h@xmath78 profile of 3c  390.3 from 1995 to 2000 ( later than those reported by eracleous et al .",
    "1997 ) , claim to have found drifts of the two peaks in opposite directions ( or velocities ) , arguing that the difference between the velocities of the blue and red peaks is inversely correlated with the continuum flux .",
    "they note that when the h@xmath78 flux decreases , the radial velocity difference between the red and blue peaks increase , while when the h@xmath78 flux increases , the velocity difference between the two peaks decreases .",
    "we point out , however , that the measurement of the wavelength of the red peak of the h@xmath78 line in 3c  390.3 is quite uncertain because this peak is severely contaminated by the [ ] @xmath4 4959 , 5007 emission lines .    the behavior of the 3c  390.3 broad h@xmath78 profile as described by shapovalova et al .",
    "( 2001 ) would be similar to the case of ngc  1097 reported here ( as discussed in sec.[interp ] ) , and they have proposed a similar interpretation : the flux increase of h@xmath78 is due to the increase in the source luminosity , which thus ionizes regions farther from the nucleus ( lower velocity ) ; the flux decrease of h@xmath78 is due to a decrease in the ionizing luminosity , which shifts the region of maximum line emission closer to the center of the disk ( higher velocity ) .",
    "the pattern precession period inferred from the model fits can be connected to the mass of the central black hole .",
    "although eccentric disks and spiral arms are related structures ( see , for example , the illustration in adams , ruden , & shu 1989 ) , in our application the precession rates are set by different mechanisms .    in the case of an eccentric disk , the precession rate",
    "is controlled by the relativistic advance of the pericenter .",
    "therefore , we adapt the formula given by weinberg ( 1972 , p. 197 ) , which we write as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the mass of the black hole in units of @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the pericenter distance of the orbit in units of @xmath83 .",
    "if the outer , most eccentric ring of the disk is precessing as prescribed by the advance of pericenter , then @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and , for a period of 7.1  years obtained in  [ s_ell ] , the resulting black hole mass is @xmath86 . if the inner rings impose a faster precession rate , the resulting mass will be somewhat larger , with an upper limit corresponding to the innermost radius of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which yield a black hole mass of @xmath89 .    in the case of the precessing spiral pattern , we can connect the precession period to the black hole mass using the results of laughlin & korchagin ( 1996 ) , who find that the pattern period is several times to an order of magnitude longer than the dynamical time .",
    "an extreme upper bound to the pattern period is the sound - crossing time of the disk .",
    "the dynamical and sound - crossing time scales are respectively given by @xmath90 @xmath91 ( adapted from frank et al .",
    "1992 ) , where now @xmath92 is the radius in the disk in units of @xmath83 and @xmath93 is the temperature in units of @xmath94  k. by comparing these time scales with the precession period of 5.5  years inferred in ",
    "[ s_sp ] , we estimate a black hole mass in the range @xmath95@xmath96 .",
    "another scenario discussed briefly in sb97 involves the precession of a radiation - induced warp in the disk ( pringle 1996 ) . in eq .",
    "( 4 ) of sb97 we estimated a precession period of the order of a decade assuming a black hole mass of @xmath97 and a mass of the accretion disk of @xmath98 .",
    "since this disk mass is , in fact , a lower limit ( see sb97 ) , the precession period determined earlier implies an upper limit on the black hole mass of @xmath99 in the context of this picture .",
    "all of the above scenarios can be assessed using a black hole mass derived from the velocity dispersion of the stars in the nucleus of ngc  1097 .",
    "emsellem et al . (",
    "2001 ) measure a velocity dispersion of @xmath100 in the inner 300  pc of the bulge of ngc  1097 . using the mass - velocity dispersion relation of tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we infer a black hole mass in the range @xmath101 , where the uncertainty is dominated by the dispersion about the best - fitting relation ( see figure 8 of tremaine et al . ) . this black hole mass disfavors both the elliptical disk and precessing warp scenarios , leaving the spiral arm scenario as the best candidate .",
    "the spiral arm scenario is also favored by the fact that it provides the best description of the variable line profiles , by better `` accommodating '' the precession scenario , as described in  4 .",
    "we have used spectroscopic observations of the broad double - peaked h@xmath0 profile of the nucleus of ngc  1097 spanning the period between 1991 nov . and 2002 oct .",
    "in order to constrain and refine models for the variability of the line profile . the profiles display the following types of variations over these 11 years .    1 .   a smooth , long - term variation in the relative strengths of the blue and red peaks .",
    "2 .   a decrease in wavelength of the blue peak and a corresponding increase in wavelength of the red peak  in other words , a broadening of the double - peaked profile , suggesting that the bulk of the emission is shifting inward to gas that is moving at higher velocities .",
    "3 .   a decrease in the integrated luminosity of the line ,",
    "so that in 2001 sep .",
    "it was approximately 1/3 of its value of 1991 nov .",
    "an inverse correlation between the width and luminosity of the line .",
    "a shift of the central wavelength of the profile ( defined as the average wavelength of the two peaks ) from approximately zero velocity relative to the narrow lines in 1991 to about @xmath102 in 2001 .",
    "the evolution of the double - peaked h@xmath0 profile of ngc  1097 , described above , lends additional support to our earlier suggestion that the variations are a result of a precessing , non - axisymmetric pattern in an accretion disk ( eracleous et al .",
    "1995 ; sb95 ; sb97 ) .",
    "we have compared the observed line profiles with models of an eccentric ( elliptical ) disk and a disk with a spiral arm and have shown that both models can reproduce the data .",
    "however , we favor the spiral arm model because ( 1 ) it can reproduce the evolution of the double - peaked profile as due to the precession of the spiral arm , while the elliptical disk model can not reproduce a smooth precession ; and ( 2 ) it implies a black hole mass that is consistent with what is inferred from the radial velocity dispersion of the stars in the nucleus , while the elliptical disk model requires a mass which is an order of magnitude lower .",
    "we have further found that the dimming of the broad double - peaked h@xmath0 line is coupled with the increasing separation of the blue and red peaks .",
    "we have interpreted this behavior as a result of the dimming of the source of ionizing radiation , which makes the maximum emission region of the disk to drift inward , and thus to regions of higher orbital velocities .",
    "this dimming of the central source is progressing independently of dynamical phenomena in the disk , which is a reasonable outcome of the tidal disruption scenario that explains the abrupt appearance of the double - peaked lines .",
    "the coupling between the luminosity and width of the line seems to hold also at shorter time scales : an increase in the flux of the line is associated with a decrease in the line width , while a decrease in flux is associated with an increase in line width . in the process of studying the evolution of the h@xmath0 profile and fitting disk models to them we found a gradual blueshift , especially at later epochs .",
    "this blueshift manifests itself as a gradual shift of the average wavelength of the two peaks .",
    "we have not attempted to model this effect since our data so far can not yield strong constraints . nevertheless , we speculate that this blueshift may be associated with the onset of an accretion disk wind ( elvis 2000 ) .",
    "outflows with typical velocities of 1000kms@xmath103  consistent with the blueshift of @xmath7400500kms@xmath103 we have measured for ngc  1097 if we consider the inclination of @xmath104 for the disk  have been frequently observed in the spectra of seyfert galaxies as absorption lines in the uv ( e.g. , kraemer , crenshaw , & gabel 2001 ) and x - rays ( the `` warm absorber '' ) , as well as in the emission lines of the narrow - line region .",
    "models for these outflows attribute their origin in the accretion disk , as , for example , a hydromagnetically driven wind of discrete clouds ( emmering , blandford , & shlosman 1992 ) , or radiatively driven continuous winds ( murray et al . 1995 ; proga , stone , & kallman 2000 ) . the presence of an outflow in the case of ngc  1097 is also consistent with observations of absorption lines in a recent _ hst _ uv spectrum ( eracleous 2002 ) .",
    "future observations of the variability of the balmer - line profiles should shed more light on the issue of the possible wind .",
