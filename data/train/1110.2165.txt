    "many past and current infrared ( ir ) observatories , both space - based and ground - based , have revealed that very small carbonaceous grains including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are ubiquitous in the general interstellar media ( ism ) in our galaxy and nearby galaxies ( e.g. mattila et al .",
    "1996 ; onaka et al . 1996 ;",
    "abergel et al . 2002 ; smith et al .",
    "the types of the galaxies span a wide range even including elliptical galaxies ( kaneda et al .",
    "2005 , 2008 ) and radio galaxies @xcite . among various gas phases of the ism",
    ", pahs are associated most tightly with neutral atomic and molecular gas , while their emission is relatively weak in ionized regions with strong radiation field probably due to destruction through the absorption of ultraviolet ( uv ) light @xcite .",
    "it is observationally known that the pah emission is well correlated with far - ir cold dust emission but rather poorly correlated with warm dust emission @xcite .",
    "the cold and warm dust components are related to the total gas content and star - formation activity , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus pahs are excellent tracers of the total amount of the general ism .",
    "their advantage over the cold dust is spatial resolution much better in the near- to mid - ir pah emission than in the far - ir dust emission , because the imaging performance of an infrared telescope is generally limited by diffraction , which is severer as the observed wavelength is longer .    despite the ubiquity as a whole , pahs are very fragile and expected to be processed and destroyed quite easily through collisions in local interstellar shock regions and hot plasma",
    ". the collisional destruction can be far more effective than the uv photo - destruction ( e.g. tielens 2008 ) . with the advent of spitzer and akari , which possess unprecedentedly high sensitivity for the pah emission",
    ", it is found that the pah emission is indeed highly suppressed as compared to dust continuum emission in supernova remnants with such hostile conditions ( e.g. reach et al .",
    "2006 ; ishihara et al .",
    "2010b ) . from recent theoretical studies combined with laboratory data , micelotta et al .",
    "( 2010a , 2010b ) calculated the collisional destruction efficiency of pahs in interstellar shocks and hot plasma . according to their results , for shock velocities higher than @xmath5100 km s@xmath6 ,",
    "pahs are completely destroyed in postshock hot plasma . it should be noted that the lifetime of dust grains is @xmath7 times longer than that of pahs even if grains are as small as pahs .",
    "this is because the dissociation yields of 2-dimentional pahs are close to unity , while the sputtering yields of 3-dimensional dust grains are much smaller than unity @xcite .",
    "since the sizes of dust responsible for far - ir continuum emission are @xmath7 times as large as those of typical pahs ( @xmath8  ; tielens 2008 ) , far - ir dust can survive against the shock on time scales @xmath9 times longer than pahs .",
    "on the other hand , for shock velocities significantly lower than 100 km s@xmath6 , pahs in shocks are not completely destroyed but their structures are significantly affected . in such a slow shock ,",
    "pahs , or small hydrogenated amorphous carbons , may even be formed by shattering of larger carbonaceous grains @xcite .",
    "such processing of pahs , or structural changes of hydrocarbons , can be traced by near - ir spectroscopy for the 3.3 @xmath1 m main feature and 3.43.6 @xmath1 m sub - features , both of which are attributed to the c - h vibration mode of carbonaceous grains .",
    "the former is due to aromatic ( @xmath10 ) hydrocarbons , while the latter is likely attributed to aliphatic ( @xmath11 ) hydrocarbons @xcite .",
    "the sub - features can also be caused by emission from upper vibrational levels of excited pahs because of anharmonicity @xcite .",
    "the aromatic feature at 3.3 @xmath1 m is sensitive to smallest pahs @xcite , and hence its intensity relative to those at longer wavelengths provides information on the size distribution of pahs .",
    "laboratory experiments showed that the relative strength of the 3.4 @xmath1 m over the 3.3 @xmath1 m band decreased after thermal annealing @xcite , indicating the structural change of carbonaceous grains from aliphatic to aromatic .",
    "thus the relative strength of the 3.3 @xmath1 m main feature to the sub - feature also provides information on the history of the evolution of carbonaceous grains in the interstellar environment .    by utilizing the nature that pahs are very easily processed and destroyed in harsh interstellar environments ,",
    "we investigate the condition of molecular clouds near the galactic center .",
    "in particular , we focus on the two molecular loops , loops 1 and 2 , found by the @xmath3co @xmath4 emission with the nanten telescope @xcite .",
    "the molecular loops are located about 300 pc away from the galactic center .",
    "@xcite suggested that such molecular loops were formed by the buoyant rise of magnetic loops due to magnetic flotation driven by the parker instability ( parker 1966 ) .",
    "the numerical simulation predicted that the floated gas slides down along the loop and then collides with disk gas , forming dense structures at the foot points of the loops @xcite .",
    "if the fall velocity exceeds the sound velocity , shock must be generated in the cloud .",
    "this phenomenon has a possibility to give some clue to long - standing questions such as an origin of high kinetic temperatures of molecular clouds in the galactic center .",
    "the several follow - up studies performed on the basis of co observations ( torii et al .",
    "2010a , 2010b ; fujishita et al .",
    "2009 ; kudo et al .",
    "2011 ) and numerical simulations @xcite consistently supported the above picture .",
    "we present the akari mid - ir 9 @xmath1 m map near the galactic center region to show the global distribution of the pah emission .",
    "we find extraplanar pah emission structures extended from the galactic plane , which have spatial correspondence to the above molecular loops .",
    "we also present the result of the @xmath12 @xmath1 m spectroscopic observations of the foot point and the top of loop 2 to show the properties of the pahs therein .",
    "our observational results suggest the processing and destruction of carbonaceous grains in the molecular loops , which may provide another piece of observational evidence for the above phenomena from an entirely different aspect from the co observations .",
    "akari carried out all - sky surveys in the six photometric bands in the mid- and far - ir during the cold mission phase ( phases 1 and 2 ) with the cryogenic telescope cooled to 6 k by liquid helium @xcite . in this paper , among them , we use a part of the 9 @xmath1 m broad - band survey map , which is of the far highest quality as of writing the paper @xcite .",
    "we removed cosmic - ray - induced spikes and changes in the offset of detector output with the algorithms developed by ishihara et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2010a ) and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we combined data taken in different seasons by removing the seasonal variation of the zodiacal light emission @xcite .",
    "details of the map - making method will be described in another paper ( ishihara et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the spatial bin size of the original 9 @xmath1 m map data is @xmath13 , limited by the telemetry downlink rate , while the full - width at half - maximum of the point spread function measured in pointed imaging observations is @xmath14 at 9 @xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "we regridded the map to the bin size of @xmath15 .",
    "after the detection and removal of point - like sources , we smoothed the map to the spatial resolution of @xmath16 in order to ensure signal - to - noise ratios higher than 5 for diffuse emission at high galactic latitudes ; the resolution size is still 12 orders of magnitude smaller than the spatial scales of the molecular loop structures to be discussed below .",
    "the resultant map of an area of about @xmath0 near the galactic center is shown in figure 1 . the constant sky background level estimated from regions at the galactic latitudes of @xmath17",
    "is subtracted .",
    "although the data have been corrected for non - linearity to @xmath18 % levels for the range of the surface brightness treated in the present study @xcite , a linear conversion factor of an analog - to - digital unit ( adu ) to mjy sr@xmath6 is yet to be finalized for diffuse maps , as of writing the paper .",
    "below , if necessary , we apply a preliminary conversion factor to convert adu to mjy sr@xmath6 for the 9 @xmath1 m map ( ishihara et al . in prep . ) .",
    "however most of our analyses and results do not require information on the absolute surface brightness in the physical units . therefore , unless explicitly stated , we use adus or normalized units for the 9 @xmath1 m surface brightness .    in the akari warm mission phase ( phase 3 ) after the boil - off of the liquid - helium cryogen , we performed near - ir slit - spectroscopic observations targeted at various positions in our galaxy . in this paper",
    ", we present four spectra obtained from on - plane and off - plane molecular loop regions near the galactic center . to remove hot pixels due to high operating temperature from the array images , we applied the same custom procedure as described in @xcite in addition to the basic pipeline process , which resulted in degrading the resolution of the spectra by 3 spectral bins . in many cases ,",
    "galactic discrete sources are found to be present in the slit apertures , which make it difficult to extract the spectra of pure galactic diffuse emission .",
    "below we used only the slit data which included 10 continuous spatial bins free of emission from discrete sources and summed the slit - aperture data of such 10 spatial bins to create diffuse spectra . for comparative purpose , in figure 2",
    ", we show the spectrum of typical galactic diffuse emission taken in the akari cold mission phase ; this was selected because the data were least contaminated by discrete sources among those taken from inner galactic regions .",
    "the spectrum has significantly better quality , especially higher spectral resolution and lower noise thanks to lower operating temperature than the spectra taken in phase 3 .",
    "the spectral features seen at wavelengths of 3.3 , 6.2 , 7,7 , 8.6 , and 11.3 @xmath1 m originate from the aromatic hydrocarbon infrared bands ( e.g. , allamandola et al .",

    "the fitting result clearly demonstrates that the spectra of on - plane regions exhibit the usually strong pah 3.3 @xmath1 m emission accompanied by the 3.43.6 @xmath1 m sub - features , whereas the spectra near the foot point and the top of loop 2 do not require the presence of the pah 3.3 @xmath1 m emission .",
    "although the broad feature at 3.43.6 @xmath1 m can potentially include larger uncertainties as described above , the 3.3 @xmath1 m narrow feature would not be affected by such systematic errors .",
    "in figures 4 and 5 , we find the trend that the ratio of the 9 @xmath1 m to the 100 @xmath1 m brightness becomes lower as the co emission is brighter .",
    "larger interstellar extinction in the mid - ir than in the far - ir systematically lowers the ratios of 9 @xmath1 m to 100 @xmath1 m brightness in dense gas regions .",
    "the dominance of neutral pahs over ionized ones in very dense gas regions could also lower the ratios , because neutral pahs emit much less in the 69 @xmath1 m region than ionized pahs @xcite .",
    "however , in figure 8 , we find that there is no significant correlation between the ratio of the 9 @xmath1 m to the 100 @xmath1 m brightness and the 100 @xmath1 m brightness .",
    "because the 100 @xmath1 m brightness should trace the total gas density , the absence of the correlation in the figure demonstrates that the 9 @xmath1 m to the 100 @xmath1 m ratio is not dependent upon gas density or extinction effects .",
    "the ratio of the co to the dust emission in figure 5 is a quantity not sensitive to the gas density but rather to the gas temperature .",
    "indeed unusually high gas temperatures ( 30100 k ) are observed in the regions associated with the foot points of loops 1 and 2 , where there are no radiative heating sources @xcite .",
    "thus the high gas temperature , not high gas density , is likely related to the lower ratios of 9 @xmath1 m to 100 @xmath1 m brightness , suggesting the destruction of pahs in the regions where the shock heating of gas takes place .",
    "more precisely , the observed increase in the ratio of the co to the dust emission can also be explained by increase in the ratio of molecular gas to total gas or the gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "however , because the 100 @xmath1 m brightness ( i.e. total gas density ) does not apparently increase at the foot points ( figures 1 and 8) , the former would call for decreases in hi density to cancel out increases in molecular gas density toward the foot points , which are not observed @xcite . the latter would suggest decrease in metallicity by a factor of @xmath49 over the local areas , which is very unlikely .    as seen in figures 5 and 8 ,",
    "the suppression of the 9 @xmath1 m emission relative to the 100 @xmath1 m is only @xmath520 % from the average .",
    "however , we have to consider a line - of - sight projection effect for the ir emission ; for example , the eastern foot point of loop 1 shows a relatively weak suppression ( figure 4b ) , presumably due to the presence of unassociated clouds lying at lower galactic latitudes . in other words ,",
    "the above level of the suppression implies the efficient destruction of pahs in local areas .",
    "therefore the result calls for such a condition in the magnetic flotation picture that the falling speed of the gas along the loop should be as fast as 50100 km s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the co emission , the foot points show large velocity dispersions of 4080 km s@xmath6 @xcite , and hence the above shock speed is reasonable .",
    "figure 4c further suggests the presence of local regions other than the foot points of loops 1 and 2 , which similarly show the suppression of the 9 @xmath1 m emission relative to the 100 @xmath1 m emission .",
    "one of such regions corresponds to the western foot point of loop 3 around @xmath50 , another molecular loop found with the nanten telescope by @xcite .",

    "the figure clearly reveals the systematically lower ratios of the pah 3.3 @xmath1 m to the 9 @xmath1 m band intensity for the loop spectra than for the galactic diffuse spectra .",
    "the additional contribution of molecular gas to the estimate on @xmath56 would make the difference even larger .",
    "in contrast , the ratios of the 9 @xmath1 m to the 100 @xmath1 m band intensity exhibit much smaller differences between these spectra , although they do show small decreases at the foot points of the loops as demonstrated in figures 4 and 5 . without the extinction corrections ,",
    "the ratios of the 9 @xmath1 m to the 100 @xmath1 m intensity are 0.280.38 for the on - plane diffuse regions and",
    "0.250.28 for the loop regions , which are consistent with typical values expected for the diffuse ism by the standard dust model @xcite .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that unresolved low - luminosity old stars contribute much to the 9 @xmath1 m emission in the loop regions @xcite .",
    "thus figure 9 shows the unusual faintness of the pah 3.3 @xmath1 m emission for the loop spectra , relative to the other pah features dominating the 9 @xmath1 m band .    in comparison",
    "to pah emission features at longer wavelengths , the relative strength of the 3.3 @xmath1 m emission is sensitive to pahs of small sizes @xcite .",
    "generally , as compared with larger pahs , small pahs have much lower absorption efficiency for visible photons than for uv photons @xcite . therefore",
    ", systematic difference in radiation hardness between the on - plane and off - plane regions could be responsible for the faintness in the pah 3.3 @xmath1 m emission of the loop spectra .",
    "the radiation hardness can be probed , for example , by the ratio of the [ cii ] 158 @xmath1 m line to far - ir continuum emission .",
    "@xcite derived the [ cii]/far - ir ratio map of the galactic center region , which indicated no systematic differences in radiation hardness between the on - plane and off - plane regions , although the galactic center itself showed a global depression in [ cii]/far - ir ratio along the galactic plane .",
    "therefore it is rather unlikely that the unusual faintness of the pah 3.3 @xmath1 m emission for the loop spectra is caused by softer radiation fields in the off - plane regions .",
    "another possibility is that the pahs are locally shielded by very dense gas , which is also unlikely from the above discussion based on figure 8 .",
    "we thus conclude that a significant fraction of small pahs have been destroyed in the regions associated with loop 2 .    as for the 3.23.6 @xmath1",
    "m excess , if the broad feature in the spectrum of figure 6c is real , it can be emitted by aliphatic c - h stretching @xcite .",
    "small hydrocarbon particles may have been produced near the foot point of the molecular loop by shattering of larger carbonaceous grains @xcite , while pre - existing small pahs have been destroyed there .",
    "these particles may have not yet been graphitized by uv heating like in planetary nebulae as formation sites of pahs .",

    "we find the presence of 9 @xmath1 m emission extended toward high galactic latitudes , which spatially corresponds to the molecular loop structure . near the foot points of the loops ,",
    "the 9 @xmath1 m emission is significantly suppressed as compared with the iras 100 @xmath1 m emission , suggesting the efficient destruction of pahs relative to submicron dust grains in these regions .",
    "we have derived near - ir spectra from the regions associated with loop 2 to compare their hydrocarbon spectral features with those typical of galactic diffuse emission .",
    "we find that the loop spectra have different spectral properties from the galactic diffuse spectra at 3.23.6 @xmath1 m , which are characterized by the faint 3.3 @xmath1 m aromatic emission and the broad excess above the linear baseline .",
    "the former represents the absence of very small pahs , while the latter possibly suggests the dominance of aliphatic hydrocarbons .",
    "these suggest the destruction of very small pahs and the shattering of carbonaceous grains .",
    "the co radio observations showed that the violent motion and the shock heating of gas took place in the loops .",
    "our ir photometric and spectroscopic results provide another piece of observational evidence for such high energetic phenomena in the loops .",
    "we would express many thanks to an anonymous referee for giving us many valuable comments .",
    "this work is based on observations made with akari .",
    "akari is a jaxa project with the participation of esa .",
