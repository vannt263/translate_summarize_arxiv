    "the neutrino signal from the next nearby core - collapse supernova ( sn ) remains the most coveted target for low - energy neutrino astronomy .",
    "galactic sne are rare , perhaps a few per century , and such an observation will be a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to look deeply inside a collapsing star and learn about its astrophysical workings as well as about neutrino properties .",
    "several detectors worldwide are in operation that will register a high - statistics signal while others are in preparation or under discussion  @xcite .    in order to assess the physics potential of various detectors or detection principles one needs the expected flavor - dependent sn neutrino flux spectra . in the absence of self - consistent three - dimensional core - collapse simulations",
    "there is no standard sn neutrino flux model and moreover , the flavor - dependent flux spectra depend on the properties of the incompletely known neutron - star equation of state , on the properties of the collapsing star , notably its mass , and , of course , on time for any given case .",
    "in this situation parametric studies , taking account of the plausible range of predictions , are the preferred course of action .",
    "we here address one particular aspect of such studies , i.e.  the plausible spectral shape of sn neutrino fluxes . on a rough level of approximation ,",
    "the spectra follow a thermal distribution that can be described in terms of an effective temperature .",
    "in detail the spectra formation is a complicated process , different energy groups emerging from different depths in the proto - neutron star atmosphere  @xcite , and a more refined description is necessary for a more detailed understanding .",
    "the next level of sophistication is to describe the non - equilibrium spectra by a three - parameter fit that allows for deviations from a strictly thermal spectrum  @xcite .",
    "one particularly simple realization are spectra where the energy - dependent neutrino number flux for each flavor has the form  @xcite @xmath3 here , @xmath1 is the average energy and @xmath2 a numerical parameter describing the amount of spectral pinching ; the value @xmath4 corresponds to a maxwell - boltzmann spectrum , and @xmath5 to a fermi - dirac distribution with zero chemical potential . in general",
    "the neutrino spectra are fitted by @xmath6  @xcite with higher @xmath7 indicating stronger pinching and @xmath8 meaning anti - pinching relative to a maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "the three parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and the overall normalization can be determined , for example , if a numerical sn simulation provides the energy flux ( luminosity ) @xmath9 in some flavor , the average energy @xmath10 and some other energy moment , for example @xmath11 or sometimes @xmath12 .    while spectra of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphafit ] ) certainly provide a reasonable overall representation , it is not obvious how well the spectral tails are reproduced . for studying detector responses with target nuclei with a significant energy threshold , it is imperative that the accuracy of the @xmath2-fit in the high - energy tail be checked against solutions of the neutrino transport equations .",
    "this is especially relevant for example for lead in the halo detector  @xcite , argon in future large - scale liquid argon detectors  @xcite , or subdominant detection channels on oxygen in water cherenkov detectors  @xcite or on carbon in liquid scintillator detectors  @xcite .",
    "modern numerical sn codes treat neutrino transport with boltzmann solvers that are expected to produce physically accurate spectra . on the other hand ,",
    "neutrino transport is the most cpu - time consuming aspect of sn simulations so that in practice the energy resolution is limited .",
    "for example , in typical simulations of the garching group , 1721 energy bins are used , corresponding to an energy resolution @xmath13 . whether such a ( seemingly ) coarse zoning is adequate for modeling the high - energy tail of the spectrum and hence for judging the quality of @xmath2-fits needs to be determined at least once by a resolution study .",
    "spectra from standard resolution ( sr ) neutrino transport simulations are therefore of little value for assessing the quality of @xmath2-fits in the spectral tail , as are monte carlo studies @xcite , which suffer from limited sampling at high energies .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate whether @xmath2-fits and sr spectra from sn simulations are sufficiently accurate to predict detection rates that are sensitive to the high - energy tail . to this end , we study the spectral shape and its impact on the relative detector response of different materials using _ high - resolution _ ( hr ) spectra computed for a few representative post - bounce times of a representative spherically symmetric simulation .",
    "these spectra have been obtained by re - converging models at a given post - bounce time after refining the energy binning . with the hr spectra",
    "we can then test how well a global fit of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphafit ] ) reproduces the relative neutrino counting rates of different materials that probe rather different parts of the spectrum .",
    "we always ignore the effect of neutrino flavor conversions .",
    "the ordinary mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect  @xcite or self - induced flavor conversions  @xcite strongly modify the flavor - dependent spectra seen by a detector on earth  @xcite .",
    "for example , the detectable @xmath14 flux will be a certain linear combination of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 spectra emitted at the source .",
    "these detection spectra need not be represented by a simple fit , in particular if self - induced conversions cause features such as `` spectral splits . '' determining the detection spectra in terms of the source spectra is the task of oscillation studies , usually performed by post - processing the fluxes provided by numerical models . justifying simple representations of the source spectra for the purpose of flavor conversion studies is one prime motivation for our work .    to this end",

    "we have performed simulations of the @xmath19 progenitor of woosley and weaver  @xcite with the neutrino hydrodynamics code prometheus - vertex @xcite , which solves the 0th and 1st neutrino moment equations with a variable eddington factor closure that is provided by the formal solution of a simplified ( model ) boltzmann equation .",
    "the explosion of the spherically symmetric model was artificially initiated @xmath20 after bounce . for the dynamical evolution of the model including the feedback into the hydrodynamics , we used 21 energy bins with a typical resolution @xmath21 ( ratio of zone width to zone mean energy ) of @xmath22 .",
    "we refer to this setup as the sr case .    in order to accurately predict the shape of the neutrino spectra , particularly in the high - energy tail , we computed high - resolution ( hr ) stationary solutions of the neutrino transport equations for a representative time during the accretion phase ( @xmath23 after bounce ) and for the proto - neutron star cooling phase ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) using the matter background from the dynamical simulation .",
    "different from the dynamical run , the original treatment of @xcite for the doppler and redshift terms is used instead of that of @xcite , and the threshold values for the monochromatic neutrino energy density below which a spectral extrapolation is performed has been reduced by a factor of 100 .",
    "we also transition continuously from the comoving frame to the lab frame once neutrino interactions cease in order to eliminate artifacts due to the velocity jump in the shock .",
    "these numerical changes accelerate convergence and help to obtain smoother and more accurate spectra .",
    "the spacing of the logarithmic energy grid was much finer with 42 bins and @xmath26 in the hr case .",
    "for better comparison , the stationary solutions for the sr case were re - computed with precisely the same numerics .",

    "( [ eq : alphafit ] ) , we determine the parameter @xmath2 in terms of the energy moments of the distribution .",
    "one way of fixing @xmath2 is to use the energy moment of order @xmath31 and notice that @xmath32 we have checked that for our cases the implied value of @xmath2 does not strongly depend on @xmath31 , which already implies that this type of fit is a reasonable representation . in the following",
    "we will use @xmath33 , i.e. , the relation @xmath34 we show examples of the fits as continuous colored curves alongside the hr spectra ( step functions ) on a logarithmic and on a linear scale in figs .",
    "[ fig : log_spectra ] and [ fig : spectra ] , respectively . for comparison",

    "we note that despite the lower energy resolution , the sr spectra from the dynamical simulation typically give very similar luminosities and mean energies , which are consistent with the hr case within @xmath36 or less .",
    "the fit parameter @xmath2 agrees similarly well except for @xmath16 in the post - explosion phase with a deviation of up to @xmath37 .",
    "however , this is due to a very steep dependence of @xmath2 on the second energy moment , @xmath38 , when the energy ratio in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) is close to unity , and does not affect the fit curves appreciably .",
    "in existing detectors , sn neutrinos are primarily measured in the @xmath14 channel by virtue of the inverse beta decay ( ibd ) reaction @xmath39 .",
    "the cross section varies roughly as @xmath40 so that the overall event rate is well reproduced , if the sn neutrino spectrum is approximated by a quasi - thermal spectrum where the second energy moment is used to determine @xmath2",
    ".    however , other detection channels are also of interest .",
    "one is elastic scattering on electrons where the cross section varies roughly linearly with @xmath41 . of greater interest for our purpose of testing the goodness of the @xmath2-fit",
    "are reactions with a higher energy threshold or steeper energy variation than ibd .",
    "one example is the recently built halo detector in snolab where 79 tons of lead are used as target material .",
    "other examples are reactions on argon in future liquid argon detectors that are primarily considered in the context of long - baseline neutrino oscillation studies and reactions on oxygen in water cherenkov detectors and on carbon in liquid scintillator detectors .     neutrino cross sections on some representative target nuclei ( see text for details ) .",
    "]    in our study we consider several selected reactions that span a broad range of spectral responses to neutrino fluxes and show the energy - dependent cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] .",
    "the reaction sensitive to the lowest range of energies is elastic scattering on electrons via both charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) for @xmath16 and @xmath17 and via nc interaction for @xmath18 @xcite .    in nuclei",

    "the @xmath17 interaction is typically suppressed at a given energy with respect to the @xmath16 interaction due to pauli blocking .",
    "neutral current interactions may also produce observable signals via ejected nucleons or de - excitation photons .",
    "as one example we consider nc interactions with @xmath44  @xcite , which is relevant for water - based detectors .",
