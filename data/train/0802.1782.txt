    "@xmath0 cep and slowly pulsating b stars ( spb ) pulsate due to the @xmath1-mechanism activated by the metal opacity bump @xcite .",
    "this give rise to @xmath2-mode pulsation in @xmath0 cep stars and @xmath3-mode pulsation in spb stars .",
    "however the theoretical standard models do not predict the presence of pulsation in @xmath0 cep and spb stars in low - metallicity environments such as the magellanic clouds .",
    "analysis of ogle data have indeed shown that @xmath0 cep and spb stars exist in the magellanic clouds though it is not clear if the rate of @xmath0 cep and spb stars is lower than or equal to the rate in the galaxy . we have therefore observed the open smc cluster ngc 371 for 12 nights in order to search for @xmath0 cep and spb stars . observing a single cluster instead of",
    "the the entire smc has a number of advantages , ",
    "e.g. the age and metallicity of the cluster can be constrained from fitting isochrones to the hr - diagram .",
    "the metallicity of the smc has been measured to between @xmath4 = 0.001 and @xmath4 = 0.004 , while @xcite have calculated instability domains of @xmath0 cep and spb stars using improved opacities and metal abundances which do not predict pulsation in @xmath0 cep and spb stars for @xmath4 @xmath5 0.005 .",
    "we should therefore not expect to find any @xmath0 cep or spb stars in the smc .    in order to test this prediction",
    "we have chosen to observe the cluster ngc 371 as this cluster has been observed before by @xcite who saw some signs of variability , though no clear evidence of pulsation was seen .",
    "the observations presented in this paper have been made with a single telescope .",
    "this means that clear mode and frequency determination can not be obtained and the frequencies can not be used for modeling .",
    "instead this work presents a number of candidate spb stars for followup observations with at least dual - side photometry and with spectroscopy .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section  2 presents the cluster .",
    "section  3 describes how we obtained , reduced and analyzed the data .",
    "the identified eclipsing binaries are presented in section  4 , the be stars in section  5 and the pulsating stars in the upper part of the main sequence in section  6 . a summary and concluding remarks are found in section  7 .",
    "ngc 371 ( @xmath6 = 11@xmath703@xmath825@xmath90,@xmath1072@xmath1104@xmath1240@xmath130 ) is a young open cluster in the smc . @xcite estimated a log(age ) of 6.7 based on isochrone fitting to ogle data assuming a metallicity of @xmath4 = 0.002 .",
    "as there are no high - resolution spectra available for ngc 371 it has not been possible to estimate the metallicity autonomously .    the field of the cluster is shown in fig .  1 with the identified variable stars marked .        [ fig01 ]",
    "the observations were obtained with the dfosc instrument at the danish 1.54-m telescope at eso , la silla during 12 nights in august and september 2005 .",
    "763 frames were collected in @xmath14 and 623 in @xmath15 .",
    "the same pointing was maintained during the observations , i.e. , the stars were kept at fixed positions on the ccd ( within a few pixels ) during the observing run .",
    "because of the crowding in the field the observations were always made in focus and the exposure times were then adjusted according to the seeing so that only the brightest 5 @xmath16 of the stars were saturated .",
    "this resulted in exposure times of approximately 20 s in @xmath14 and 60 s in @xmath15 . in fig .",
    "2 all the data are shown for one of the bright stars in ngc 371 , illustrating the time distribution of the data set .",
    "the ccd images were calibrated using standard procedures , i.e. a master bias was subtracted from each frame before the frames were divided by a master sky - flat in each filter .",
    "the master bias was obtained from a large number of frames from the whole observing run and the master sky - flats were obtained as the median of a large number of evening and morning sky - flats .",
    "we checked that both the bias and the flat - fields were indeed stable over the length of the observing run .",
    "the photometric reductions were done using the software package momf @xcite .",
    "momf applies a very robust algorithm combining psf and aperture photometry in semi - crowded fields .    some of the light curves showed residuals of systematic trends caused by , e.g. , air mass , cloud cover , and temperature variations ( these residuals",
    "are sometimes referred to as `` red noise '' ) .",
    "we therefore applied the algorithm introduced by @xcite in order to correct for systematic effects .",
    "this clearly improved the rms noise level , in particular in the brightest stars .",
    "the resulting light curves had rms noise levels over the whole observing run ranging from a few mmag in the bright end and up to 50 mmag in the faint end .",
    "some of the light curves showed night - to - night drifts , which means that the rms noise level in the individual nights was lower than over the whole observing run .",
    "2 shows the precision in a typical bright star .",
    "[ fig02 ]      we obtained differential light curves of 6842 stars in the 13.5 @xmath17 13.5 fov and we searched for variability in all these light curves .",
    "the light curves were kept in the instrumental system , but calibrated @xmath18 photometry was obtained from @xcite .",
    "we used two complementary algorithms to search for variability ; the analysis of variance periodograms @xcite and simultaneous iterative sine wave fitting based on the lomb periodogram .",
    "we searched for variability both with and without using statistical weights .",
    "the statistical weights were assigned as the standard deviation of all data points separated by less than 15 minutes from a given data point .",
    "for the analysis of variance approach we made visual examination of all light curves which had fit qualities better than 0.9 and for the lomb periodogram approach we made visual examination of all light curves where the same peak in the periodogram was present in both @xmath15 and @xmath14 with a s / n higher than 4 in amplitude . in total we ended up with a list of a little over a hundred stars that were selected for further analysis .    in the visual examination",
    ", stars were rejected mainly because of one of the following three causes : stars were placed outside the cluster region , stars were placed close to a hot pixel or a bad column , or the variability was not the same in the two filters .",
    "this gave us the list of the 37 stars presented in this paper .",
    "light curves of all the variable stars will be added to cds .",
    "it is not possible to determine if a star is a true cluster member or not , as we only have two dimensional images available . to determine if a star is likely to be a true cluster member in three dimension a spectroscopic analysis is needed",
    "therefore we can not give a reliable estimate of the number of cluster members and some of the identified variable stars could turn out not to be clusters members .",
    "[ fig03 ]    we have detected 5 eclipsing binaries ( phased light curves are shown in fig .  3 ) .",
    "v1 , v2 and v3 are located on the edge of the cluster , which means that they might not be cluster members .",
    "v4 and v5 are located safely inside the cluster and these stars could be important in determining the precise distance and age of the cluster",
    ". this information will again be important when trying to model the excitation mechanisms of @xmath0 cep and spb stars based on data from this cluster .",
    "v2 also shows some signs of pulsation with a frequency of 6.2 c / d , which suggest that this could be a binary system with one of the members being a pulsating star .",
    "but more photometry will be needed in order to evaluate the phenomenon properly , ",
    "i.e removing the eclipse from the light curve before analyzing the pulsation .",
    ".stellar parameters for 5 eclipsing binaries in ngc 371 .",
    "periods are in days [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab3 ]      we have used the photometry from @xcite to make a @xmath15 versus @xmath19 color - magnitude - diagram of ngc 371 as shown in fig .  7 .",
    "the center of the cluster was placed on @xmath6 = 11@xmath703@xmath825@xmath90,@xmath1072@xmath1104@xmath1240@xmath130 and the size was selected as a circle with a radius of 5. the color - magnitude - diagram shows the upper part of the main sequence , which is almost vertical , and the giant branch .",
    "all the identified variable stars which are not eclipsing binaries or be stars are located on the upper part of the main sequence , which is also where the instability strips for @xmath0 cep and spb stars would be located if the metallicity of the cluster had been larger .",
    "instability analysis of models of hot main sequence stars of solar metallicity show a group of mostly p - mode pulsators where the longest period is the fundamental radial mode and a second group of cooler stars with mostly g - modes and longer periods .",
    "the first group can be identified with the classical @xmath0  cep stars ( early b - type stars ) while the second group can be identified with the spb stars ( mid b - type stars ) .",
    "models based on revised solar metal abundances and different opacities show that the hot boundary of the spb instability strip overlaps with the @xmath0 cep instability strip @xcite . at the metallicity of ngc 371 ,",
    "however , no pulsations are excited in the models as already mentioned .",
    "therefore theory can not be used as a guide in classification .",
    "we will come back to this in the next section .",
    "we have used the padova evolutionary code described in @xcite to calculate an isochrone for the color - magnitude - diagram of the cluster .",
    "the model used solar heavy elements mixture .",
    "we adopted a metalicity of @xmath4=0.002 and a log(age ) of 6.7 from @xcite .",
    "the distance modulus was chosen to 18.7 from @xcite and the reddening to @xmath20 .",
    "the isochrone is plotted on top of the color - magnitude - diagram in fig .",
    "here it is seen that the isochrone generally fits the data nicely .",
    "[ fig06 ]      in the galaxy , @xmath0 cephei stars have periods which are consistent with mostly p - mode pulsations .",
    "the longest period is that of the fundamental radial mode for which the pulsation constant @xmath21 d@xmath22 @xcite . to classify stars in ngc 371",
    "we need an estimate of q for each star : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the period in days , @xmath25 the mass , @xmath26 the luminosity and @xmath27 the effective temperature .",
    "since we do not have data to estimate the masses , luminosities and effective temperatures for individual stars , we use these values of the isochrone shown in fig .",
    "the result is shown in fig . 8 together with all the identified periods as a function of @xmath15 magnitude . there",
    "the mode with the longest period in each star is plotted with large crosses , while the secondary modes with shorter periods are plotted with small diamonds .    in fig .",
    "8 it is seen that all stars have periods that are longer than the fundamental radial periods .",
    "we therefore identify all the stars as candidate spb stars .",
    "classification of the stars as bona fide spb stars would require more time series observations to ensure that the periods are correct and exclude other sources of variability , such as close binaries .    if there are @xmath0 cep stars in the cluster then we can assume two things about them ; that they are generally brighter than the spb stars and that they have periods shorter than the fundamental radial period .",
    "we do not detect any pulsating stars in this domain than fulfill the detection criteria given in section 3.1 and therefore we do not detect any candidate @xmath0 cep stars in ngc 371 .    in order to constrain an upper detection limit of @xmath0 cep stars in the cluster we measured the highest peak in the amplitude spectrum between 8 and 20 c / d for all the stars brighter than 15.8 in @xmath15 . a frequency range from 8 to 20 c / d is in agreement with the frequency range in which the @xmath0 cep stars are expected for this cluster ( see fig .",
    "for the brightest stars we could also have included periods up to 0.4 day , but this gave problems with the @xmath28 noise in the amplitude spectra of some of the stars .    in fig .",
    "9 we have plotted the amplitude of the highest peaks as a function of magnitude together with the mean @xmath29 oscillation amplitude of galactic @xmath0 cep stars from @xcite .",
    "it is seen that our detection limit is significantly lower than the mean @xmath29 oscillation amplitude of galactic @xmath0 cep . if @xmath0 cep stars are present in the cluster they have oscillation amplitudes significantly lower than the galactic @xmath0 cep stars .",
    "though we do not detect any candidate @xmath0 cep stars some of the stars do show variability between 8 and 20 c / d , but not with a s / n higher than 4 in both filters . in fig .",
    "9 we have marked the peaks which have s / n higher than 3.5 in @xmath15 and in fig .",
    "10 we have plotted the amplitude spectrum of one of them .",
    "the detection criteria of s / n higher than 4 in both filters is generally conservative and for longer regularly sampled data sets it is too high as the observations in the two filters are independent .",
    "but for the present data set it seems as a good indication of pulsation .",
    "more photometric data is needed in order to classify these stars as candidate @xmath0 cep stars . on the other hand if these stars are @xmath0 cep stars they would be very interesting targets as they would have shorter periods and lower oscillation amplitudes compared to the galactic @xmath0 cep stars .    though periods below 0.1 day are not common in @xmath0 cep stars they have been seen in the very young cluster ngc 6231 .        [ fig07 ]     cep stars in the galaxy in@xmath29 .",
    "the arrow marks the star plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ]      we have also calculated and plotted the amplitude ratios and phase difference between the @xmath15 and @xmath14 filters ( fig .",
    "11 ) in order to identify any systematic effects that could be compared with theoretical models as in or used for mode identification . though we do not find any systematic effects in phase difference versus amplitude ratio within the uncertainties ( fig .",
    "11 ) we do see that the main part of the observed frequencies cluster around an amplitude ratio between 0.5 and 1.0 which is expected for oscillations in @xmath0 cep stars with degrees between 0 and 2 .    the @xmath30 amplitude ratio can also be used to exclude other causes of the variability than pulsation ( e.g. ellipsoidal variables ) as the @xmath30 amplitude ratios are general below unity .",
    "the last thing to note about the frequencies is that all the multimode pulsators are found among the pulsating stars in the upper part of the main sequence ( except for one ) .",
    "one reason for this could be that these stars are brighter , which in general gives a higher s / n , but some of the frequencies that we detect in the stars in the lower part of the main sequence have such a high amplitude that multimode pulsation should have been discovered if it was present ( see table  3 ) .",
    "we have identified 5 eclipsing binaries , 3 periodic be stars and 29 candidate spb stars in ngc371 .",
    "the results indicates that excitation of oscillations in spb stars is more common in low metallicity environments such as the smc than predicted by standard stellar models . as a possible extension to the standard stellar models to account for",
    "this discrepancy could be to include local iron enhancement by diffusion and radiative accelerations @xcite .    if there are @xmath0 cep stars in the cluster they would generally be brighter than the spb stars and have periods shorter than the fundamental radial period and we do not detect pulsation in any stars in this domain with an upper limit on the oscillation amplitudes of 5 mmag .    though it is not possible to calculate a reliable number for the fraction of spb stars in ngc 371 the absolute number of pulsating stars seems to be high compared to the fraction obtained for the galaxy by @xcite .",
    "we see evidence that multimode pulsation is more common in upper part of the main sequence than in the lower .    we have also identified periodic pulsation in 3 stars that were previously identified as be stars .",
    "these stars can used to study the relation between the be phenomenon and @xmath0 cep and spb stars in low - metallicity environments .",
    "the results presented here strongly confirm and increase our interest in ngc 371 as an excellent laboratory for @xmath0 cep and spb stars .     of one of the stars showing signs of @xmath0 cep variability between 8 and 20 c / d with a s / n below 4 .",
