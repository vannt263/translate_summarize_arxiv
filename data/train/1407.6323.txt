    "quantum ideas have led to surprising developments in the field of secure communication .",
    "the most startling example is that of cryptography , where quantum ideas have revolutionized the field .",
    "while most classical cryptography schemes depend on computational complexity for their security , quantum cryptographic schemes  @xcite offer security based on physical laws .",
    "there have been further developments such as quantum secure direct communication  @xcite , quantum secret sharing  @xcite , quantum authentication and quantum signatures  @xcite .",
    "secure multi - party computation allows several distrustful parties to jointly compute a function while keeping their inputs private  @xcite , and is of fundamental importance in secure communication .",
    "a particular instance is to compute the equality function with just two parties  @xcite .",
    "quantum private comparison ( qpc ) aims to do the above computation without sharing the party s private information .",
    "this is in contrast to quantum key distribution ( qkd ) which provides a secure way to share private information .",
    "let alice and bob have private information @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "qpc involves the computation of the function @xmath2 such that @xmath3 furthermore , at the end of the protocol alice and bob do not wish the other party to learn anything about their information , apart from what can be inferred logically from @xmath2 .",
    "lo  @xcite pointed out that the above function @xmath2 can not be computed securely by two parties alone .",
    "hence a third party is needed to facilitate the process .",
    "one might think that a three - party qpc is trivial .",
    "both alice and bob can convey their information to a trusted third party  ( charlie ) and he can tell alice and bob the outcome of the function @xmath4 . the problem here is a little different ; alice and bob do not wish to disclose their information to anyone , including charlie and yet wish to compare their private information .",
    "in fact , they do not want to transmit the information at all . in the past several three - party quantum protocols",
    "have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "they impose the following restriction on the third party :    1 .",
    "charlie tries to learn information about alice and bob s input while being restricted to faithfully follow the protocol .",
    "in other words he is semi - honest or _ honest but curious_. 2 .",
    "charlie may know the positions at which @xmath0 and @xmath1 differ , but not the actual bit values .",
    "further , these protocols assume that all channels are noiseless or remain silent on this aspect .",
    "we show that under the proposed restrictions , we can build a protocol to achieve qpc even under noisy conditions .",
    "a slight modification of our protocol allows us to relax the condition , that charlie is honest .",
    "that is , he may not cooperate with alice and bob and return false results .",
    "we also show how our protocol is more efficient than similar quantum protocols  @xcite .",
    "it is hard to build perfect quantum channels and hence we must build protocols that are robust against noise .",
    "we choose a specific protocol described by tseng et .",
    "@xcite and add noise to its channels .",
    "we consider depolarizing noise , bit flip and phase flip noise .",
    "we show that the protocol as such , is not robust under noise .",
    "we note that three - party qpc involves transmission of correlated keys between the parties , and that under noise these correlations are altered .",
    "quantum error correction helps overcome the effects of noise .",
    "we note that quantum error correction and quantum cryptography have a deep connection  @xcite . exploiting this connection",
    ", we use the css quantum error correction scheme  @xcite to transmit correlated keys to relevant parties under noisy conditions in a secure manner .",
    "this allows us to perform three - party qpc under noisy conditions .",
    "further , by repeated use of our protocol and through cooperation between alice and bob , any dishonesty on the part of charlie can also be detected .",
    "we review the epr - based qpc protocol given in  @xcite .",
    "alice and bob have @xmath5 bit strings @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "they want to compare their information with the help of a semi - honest third party called charlie . let alice , bob and charlie be connected by noiseless quantum channels that can be eavesdropped upon and classical channels that can be eavesdropped upon but not altered . for each qubit , we consider the computational basis @xmath6 and @xmath7 and define the rotated basis state as @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for pairs of qubits",
    "the four bell states are defined as latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }        using these resources over the quantum channels and classical communication over the classical channels , the secure qpc protocol proceeds as follows :    1 .",

    "he prepares a quantum state .",
    "if the bit is @xmath12 then he prepares one of the states from @xmath13 ( it does not matter which ) . otherwise , he prepares one of the states from @xmath14 .",

    "[ step1 ] 2 .",
    "charlie prepares two sets of decoys @xmath17 and @xmath18 randomly in the states : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "charlie randomly interleaves @xmath17 with @xmath15 and @xmath18 with @xmath16 to form @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are then sent to alice and bob respectively .",
    "[ step2 ] 3 .   upon receipt of the complete sequences",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 , alice and bob signal charlie to disclose the positions and the basis ( @xmath25 or @xmath26 ) for measuring the decoys.[step3 ] 4 .",
    "alice and bob measure the decoys in the appropriate basis and consult over a classical channel to check for eavesdroppers . if the error rate is more than a predetermined rate then they abort the protocol , else they proceed.[step4 ] 5 .",
    "alice and bob measure the non - decoy particles in the @xmath27 basis to obtain bit strings @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "note that each of @xmath28 and @xmath29 are uniformly random while @xmath30.[step5 ] 6 .",
    "alice and bob calculate @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "they cooperate to calculate @xmath33 and send it to charlie.[step6 ] 7 .",
    "charlie computes @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 has a single non - zero entry if and only if @xmath36 , in which case charlie outputs @xmath37 , otherwise he outputs @xmath12 . [ step7 ]    it is not hard to see that in the absence of noise and eavesdropping , the protocol computes the function @xmath2 with certainty .",
    "we note that if an eavesdropper ( eve ) passes undetected then the output of the protocol can be different from @xmath2 because eve can tamper with the non - decoy particles ( she may cause @xmath38 ) and make the protocol malfunction .",
    "it has been shown that the above protocol is secure against certain insider and outsider attacks  @xcite and hence computes @xmath2 with very high probability .      in the qpc protocol described above , perfect ( noiseless ) single qubit quantum channels between alice , bob and charlie",
    "have been employed . in any real situation ,",
    "noise can act on these channels in a number of ways . therefore , we need to consider noisy one qubit channels instead of noiseless channels and explore the possibility of carrying out qpc over these noisy channels .",
    "we begin by describing the noisy channels and then figure out their effect on the epr - based qpc protocol .",
    "the bit flip channel with error probability @xmath39 is defined through its action on a one qubit density operator @xmath40 via the action of the bit flip gate @xmath41 as @xmath42 similarly , the phase flip channel with error probability @xmath39 is described through the action of the phase flip gate @xmath27 as @xmath43 the depolarizing channel with error probability @xmath44 is @xmath45 the above equation admits the interpretation that the state is acted upon by each pauli operator with probability @xmath46 and remains unchanged with probability @xmath39 .",
    "let both the channels between alice and charlie ( ac ) and between bob and charlie ( bc ) suffer from depolarizing noise .",
    "if the error represented by the pauli matrix @xmath47 acts on the ac channel and the error represented by @xmath48 affects the bc channel then we call the combined error @xmath49 . from equation ( [ eq : dpn1 ] )",
    "we see that under depolarizing noise the channel acts such that each pauli matrix acts on the qubit with equal probability @xmath50 . since both the channels ac and bc are independent the errors act independently .",
    "hence , the probability for an @xmath51 error is @xmath52 .",
    "if an error acts such that it takes the state @xmath13 to the state @xmath53 or vice - versa then the protocol will return an incorrect answer .",
    "this happens because the flipping of a correlated to an anti - correlated state and vice - versa , makes the string @xmath11 an unfaithful record of the positions at which @xmath28 and @xmath29 differ .",
    "after the error has acted @xmath54 where @xmath55 so in step  [ step7 ] of protocol  1 , charlie gets @xmath56 instead of @xmath57 .    under the action of depolarizing noise mentioned in equation ( [ eq : dpn1 ] ) the probability that",
    "the state changes from @xmath13 to @xmath14 or vice - versa is @xmath58 , which means that the probability that @xmath11 and @xmath59 differ at a given position is @xmath60 . even if there is a difference at a single position in @xmath11 and @xmath59 the protocol will give wrong results .",
    "let @xmath5 be the length of the strings and @xmath61 the probability that @xmath62 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath63 hence the protocol @xcite is not robust against any amount of depolarizing noise . for large @xmath5 and small @xmath60 , the error is linear in @xmath60 .",
    "consider bit flip and phase flip noise in channels ac and bc .",
    "suppose bit flip  ( [ eq : xerror ] ) acts with probability @xmath44 and phase flip  ( [ eq : zerror ] ) with probability @xmath64 .",
    "the combined action of the error is given by @xmath65 equation ( [ eq : noisef ] ) gives the total action of noise on each channel .",
    "let the length of @xmath11 and @xmath59 be @xmath5 , then @xmath66    hence the protocol @xcite is robust against phase flip but not bit flip noise . for large @xmath5 and small @xmath44 , the error is linear in @xmath44 .",
    "we see that due to depolarizing noise and bit flip noise in the communication channels between alice  ( bob ) and charlie , the protocol returns incorrect results .",
    "this is because noise alters the quantum state being sent and consequently the string @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this alteration results in @xmath11 ( the string with charlie ) becoming an unfaithful record of the correlations between @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in general , channels are noisy and any protocol fit for implementation must be robust against noise . hence we need to design protocols that work even under noisy conditions .",
    "in order to perform three - party qpc under noise it is necessary to preserve the information encoded in the quantum states being sent by charlie to alice  ( bob ) .",
    "this will ensure that @xmath11 remains a faithful record of the correlations .",
    "one way to achieve this , is through error correction on the quantum states being sent to convey @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we utilize css codes to perform error correction  @xcite .",
    "we note that these codes have a deep connection with qkd  @xcite .",
    "we propose a protocol for qpc that is robust under noise and completely secure from attacks .",
    "the basic idea is to use the css codes to securely transfer a known key from charlie to alice and bob .",
    "this allows the qpc to work perfectly under noise as long as the bit ( phase ) error rate is under an acceptable limit .",
    "we review the css codes  @xcite and the protocol for using css codes to perform a secure key distribution of a known random key .",
    "suppose @xmath67 and @xmath68 are @xmath69 $ ] and @xmath70 $ ] classical linear codes such that @xmath71 , @xmath67 and @xmath72 both correct @xmath73 errors .",
    "then @xmath74 is an @xmath75 $ ] quantum error correcting code capable of correcting @xmath73 qubit errors .",
    "for @xmath76 we define a code state @xmath77 where @xmath78 is summation modulo @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath80 belong to the same coset in @xmath68 i.e. @xmath81 then they define the same code state , hence the total number of distinct code states is the number of cosets of @xmath68 in @xmath67 , @xmath82 .",
    "each code state can be used to encode a distinct @xmath5 bit classical string .",
    "this can then be exchanged between interested parties.the code state can get affected by noise in the channel , which we must be able to correct .",
    "it is sufficient to write the corrupted code state as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the @xmath5 bit string with a non - zero entry only at positions where a bit flip has occurred and @xmath85 is a similar @xmath5 bit string for phase flips . by correcting both these kind of errors we can correct any kind of error  @xcite . in order to detect and correct errors we consider @xmath86 the pauli matrix acting on the @xmath87 bit , where @xmath88 .",
    "the operator @xmath89}_{a}$ ] is defined as @xmath90}_{a } = \\sigma^{l_1}_{a(1 ) } \\oplus \\sigma^{l_2}_{a(2 ) } \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\sigma^{l_n}_{a(n)}\\ ] ] @xmath91 is an @xmath5 bit string and its @xmath92 entry is @xmath93 that takes values from @xmath94 . by definition @xmath95 .",

    "this syndrome is used to determine the most likely error @xmath99 .",
    "note that the @xmath103 entry of the column vector @xmath104 is @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the @xmath103 row in @xmath97 .    for correcting the quantum state in equation ( [ error : state ] ) , we employ a measurement protocol along similar lines .",

    "thus by measuring @xmath89}_{z}$ ] for each row @xmath113 we obtain the full syndrome . the @xmath114 column entry for the phase flip error syndrome @xmath115",
    "is similarly obtained by measuring @xmath116}_{x}$ ] where @xmath117 is the @xmath114 row of @xmath108 . from these syndromes",
    "we can accurately get back @xmath84 and @xmath85 using classical linear coding theory as long as @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively .",
    "we then correct the corrupted state and retrieve the encoded state @xmath120    a generalized @xmath74 code for any two @xmath5-bit strings @xmath121 and @xmath122 can be defined as @xmath123 we may use these code states .",
    "let @xmath124 then we denote the quantum code with the above code states as @xmath125 .",
    "for @xmath126 and @xmath127 @xmath125 reduces to @xmath74 .",
    "if we measure @xmath89}_{z}$](@xmath128 ) and @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) on code state ( [ eq : q1 ] ) then we will obtain syndromes corresponding to @xmath131 and @xmath132 respectively . if there was a bit flip error @xmath84 and a phase flip error @xmath85 on the code state ( [ eq : q1 ] ) then our syndrome measurements would be corresponding to @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "we can recover the error with the understanding that we must subtract @xmath121 and @xmath122 to retrieve the @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "if we perform syndrome measurements on any state @xmath135 and obtain that the syndrome are both null vectors then we can conclude @xmath136 for some @xmath137 .",

    "if we obtain syndromes corresponding to @xmath139 and @xmath140 for bit and phase flip respectively , then we may conclude that @xmath135 has been projected onto a subspace spanned by code states of @xmath141 .",
    "let us first describe the css based protocol for sharing a known randomly chosen secret key .",
    "let us assume that a secret key is to be distributed between alice and charlie .",
    "[ css ]    1 .",
    "alice creates @xmath5 random check bits , a random @xmath142 bit key @xmath143 and a random @xmath144 bit string @xmath145 .",
    "alice generates @xmath146 by choosing @xmath5-bit strings @xmath121 and @xmath122 at random .",
    "alice encodes her key @xmath143 as @xmath147 using the css code @xmath148 .",
    "alice chooses @xmath5 positions ( out of @xmath144 ) and puts the check bits in these positions and the code bits in the remaining positions .",
    "alice applies a hadamard transform to those qubits in those positions where @xmath145 is @xmath37 .",
    "alice sends the resulting state to charlie .",
    "he acknowledges the receipt once he receives all qubits .",
    "alice announces @xmath145 , the positions of the check bits , the values of the check bits and the strings @xmath149 .",
    "charlie performs hadamard on the qubits where @xmath145 is @xmath37 .",
    "charlie checks whether too many of the check bits have been corrupted , and aborts the protocol if so .",
    "10 . with the help of @xmath149 , charlie decodes the key bits and uses them for the key .",
    "the above protocol works correctly and is unconditionally secure as long as the noise is under a given threshold value  @xcite .",
    "the protocol for carrying out qpc under noisy conditions is as follows    [ css - qpc ]    1 .",
    "charlie generates a random @xmath5 bit string @xmath28 and uses the css code based quantum error correction protocol(protocol  [ css ] ) to send it to alice .",
    "2 .   charlie generates a random @xmath5 bit string @xmath11 and computes @xmath150 3 .",
    "charlie uses protocol  [ css ] to send @xmath29 to bob .",
    "alice and bob compute @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "alice and bob collaborate together to compute @xmath153 and send it to charlie over a public channel . 6 .",
    "charlie computes @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 has a single non - zero entry if and only if @xmath36 , in which case charlie outputs @xmath37 , otherwise he outputs @xmath12    the entire process is summarized in figure  [ figure ] .",
    "it is easy to see that in the absence of noise and eavesdropping the protocol computes the function @xmath2 correctly . in the presence of noise alone",
    "the css based scheme can transmit keys correctly as long as noise is within an acceptable level ( the current acceptable level of bit(phase ) flip errors is @xmath154  @xcite ) .",
    "when both noise and eavesdropping are allowed the protocol is secure and gives correct results with very high probability .",
    "we now show the security and correctness in the presence of noise and eavesdropping .",
    "we note that participant attacks are stronger than non - participant attacks since participants always have more information .",
    "we consider attacks by alice and bob to demonstrate the security of the protocol .",
    "consider an attack by alice to gain information about @xmath1 .",
    "she can attack the transmission channel between bob and charlie , and try to extract information by performing any physical operation permitted by quantum mechanics .",
    "alternatively she may exploit side channel attacks which exploit loopholes in the devices used to implement key distribution  @xcite .",
    "these two are fundamentally different kinds to attack .",
    "let us first analyze a direct attack on the transmission by alice .",
    "she has access to @xmath0 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath28 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath0 contains no information about @xmath1 .",
    "we note @xmath157 , hence information about @xmath29 implies information about @xmath1 and vice - versa .",
    "alice can gain information about @xmath29 through @xmath11 ( @xmath158 ) , alternatively she may intercept the communication between bob and charlie .",
    "the semi - honest nature of charlie ensures that alice does not learn anything about @xmath11 .",
    "we know  @xcite that once bob and charlie authenticate the css protocol the probability that intercepts by alice go undetected is exponentially close to @xmath37 . in the event",
    "the protocol is authenticated alice s mutual information about the key  ( @xmath1 ) is exponentially small .",
    "so , any attack by alice on the communication between bob and charlie can not help her gain more than an exponentially small amount of information about @xmath29 without going undetected with a probability exponentially close to @xmath37 .",
    "so with very high probability , attacks by alice are unsuccessful .",
    "consider an attack by alice on the devices used to implement the css based key distribution scheme .",
    "a css based scheme can be turned into an equivalent modified bb-84 scheme  @xcite , we need only analyze attacks on the latter to discuss the security of the former .",
    "implementations of qkd employ devices that may not adhere to the strict assumptions made while proving their unconditional security .",
    "this allows for side channels for eavesdroppers to attack .",
    "these attacks can also be tackled .",
    "one can use measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution  @xcite and appropriate experimental designs  @xcite to achieve this .",
    "specifically it has been shown that we can implement key distribution such that it is immune to all side channel attacks  @xcite .    in the event the attacks are unsuccessful ,",
    "then we need only care about the noise .",
    "but as we saw earlier the css protocol is robust as long as the noise is under an acceptable level .",
    "since the protocol is symmetric with respect to alice and bob , any attacks by bob are also ruled out .",
    "we note that charlie has access to @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath11 and @xmath159 and is restricted to be semi - honest .",
    "it is easy to see that under these restrictions , he can gain no information about @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "it is possible to modify our protocol to achieve three party qpc for weaker conditions on the third party .",
    "we allow the third party to be dis - honest , in the sense that he may return incorrect comparisons to alice and bob .",
    "we note that by providing false results charlie does not stand to gain any information about the private strings of alice and bob .",
    "we adapt the technique from  @xcite for our purposes .",
    "alice and bob , share @xmath142 strings whose values are known to them .",
    "they repeat the qpc protocol(as described above ) @xmath160 times .",
    "they compare @xmath142 known strings and @xmath37 secret string .",
    "their secret strings are compared at some random repetition , known to alice and bob but unknown to charlie .",
    "this prevents charlie from being dishonest . in the event charlie tries to give false information to alice and bob , he is caught with high probability(@xmath161 )",
    "we analyze epr based three - party qpc under noisy conditions and show that it is not robust under any amount of bit flip noise and depolarizing noise .",
    "we then present a css based protocol that is robust against noise and secure under general attacks , as long as the noise is under an acceptable rate .",
    "it is important to compare our work with the available classical and quantum protocols in the literature . recently",
    "a protocol using quantum key distribution(qkd )  @xcite have been proposed .",
    "this protocol does not consider noisy channels or side channel attacks . though it is possible from our analysis above , to extend their work to the noisy channel case . in terms of resources , for the case of a semi - honest third party , their protocol achieves qpc using @xmath162 qkd relays each sharing @xmath5 bits of information . in comparison",
    "our protocols uses @xmath79 qkd like relays , decreasing the quantum resources and communication complexity by a factor of @xmath79 . however , the overall communication complexity and quantum resources(in terms of entangled states used to implement a qkd ) are still @xmath163 .",
    "several classical protocols have been designed to perform two - party and multi - party secure computation .",
    "these protocols either work under an honest majority  @xcite or a _ common reference string_(crs ) along with complexity assumptions  @xcite or demand access to a trusted dealer  @xcite  ( implemented using public key technique ) but are able to tackle both passive and active adversaries .",
    "it is well known that certain complexity assumptions such as absence of polynomial time algorithms for prime factorization or discrete logarithm are invalid when the adversary has access to quantum resources  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "it is possible to use classical public - key cryptosystems based on the hardness of learning with errors  @xcite .",
    "these cryptosystems can not be broken by quantum algorithms presently known to us .",
    "implementations of public key cryptosystems are expensive but can be done with @xmath164 classical resources . in our work",
    "we consider only @xmath79 parties and propose a protocol to compute a single function  ( equality ) but allow the parties to be corrupted by an adversary who however does not inject incorrect information into the protocol .",
    "while we do not need complexity assumptions we do need secure channels between the interested parties and we take into account the resources expended in creating secure channels . in our proposal the resources  ( classical and quantum ) utilized to implement the protocol from scratch are linear in the size of the input .",
    "our proposal based on previous work demands a trusted third party but we show how that assumption can be relaxed by repeating the protocol several times , consequently incurring a cost which is still linear in the size of the input .",
    "we note that our protocol no longer uses epr states , but requires the used of css code states . in order to send css",
    "encoded information we may require multiqubit channels . in order to perform qpc under noise",
    "we exploit the connection between css codes and key distribution .",
    "this enables us to provide unconditional security for qpc in real time implementation schemes",
    ".    it would be interesting to see if other qpc protocols that use @xmath165 level quantum systems or greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states can also be made unconditionally secure against all possible attacks .",
    "it would also be worthwhile to explore protocols that work under milder restrictions on the third party and protocols that can work for multi - party and implement a wider class of functions .",
