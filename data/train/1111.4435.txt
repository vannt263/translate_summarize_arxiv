    "the @xcite lf is used to count galaxies ( and therefore to normalize the total ebl spectral intensity ) at each redshift .",
    "the lf as well as our galaxy sample is divided into three magnitude bins according to the absolute rest - frame @xmath4-band magnitude , faint , middle and bright . within every magnitude bin , an sed type is statistically attached to each galaxy in the lf assuming sed - type fractions that are a function of redshift within those magnitude bins .",
