    "the conjecture @xmath5-srbc is certainly the most important special case of the first more general conjecture ; as shown in the appendix of @xcite these conjectures follow from the rational surjectivity of an appropriately defined baum - connes assembly map .",

    "the standard way of arriving at this result is via the isomorphism of sets @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the set of elements conjugate to @xmath16 , and the correspondence is given by @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath30 is equipped with word - length @xmath31 , this map becomes a @xmath2-g - morphism of weighted right @xmath2-g - sets in the sense of @xcite , but one whose inverse is in general unbounded .",
    "this leads to the notion of @xmath2-solvable conjugacy bound , introduced in @xcite - the condition that the map in ( [ eqn : fundmap ] ) is a @xmath2-g - isomorphism - which in turn allows for the identification of the summands @xmath11 in terms of the rapid decay homology of @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "unfortunately , this condition is very restrictive , as it requires the group to have a conjugacy problem which is solvable in @xmath2-bounded time .",
    "in particular , when @xmath9 , it is difficult to go much beyond hyperbolic groups with this restriction in place ( the main result of @xcite was verification of a relative version of the @xmath5-bc conjecture in the presence of relative hyperbolicity ) .    with this in mind , we may now state our main result , by which the solvable conjugacy bound constraint of @xcite is removed . the consequence is a complete characterization of the conjugacy class summands of the hochschild and cyclic ( co)-homology groups of @xmath8 for any group with word - length @xmath3 and bounding class @xmath2 . recall that the of a subgroup with length function @xmath34 of a group with length function @xmath35 is the function @xmath36 defined by @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a discrete group equipped with proper word - length function and @xmath2 a countable bounding class .",
    "then for each conjugacy class @xmath4 there are isomorphisms in topological hochschild ( co)-homology @xmath38 these isomorphisms imply the existence of isomorphisms in topological cyclic ( co)-homology @xmath39    here the weighting on @xmath32 and @xmath33 comes from the induced word - length function on @xmath21 and the corresponding quotient word - length function on @xmath26 , while @xmath40 , @xmath41 denote the @xmath2-bounded ( co)-homology groups as defined in @xcite ( and reviewed below ) . for the cyclic groups , the @xmath42$]-module and comodule structures of the terms on the right are exactly as in the case of the group algebra for both elliptic and non - elliptic classes ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "finally , @xmath43 refers to the distortion of the infinite cyclic subgroup @xmath44 of @xmath30 ; the condition @xmath45 means that the distortion of @xmath44 is bounded above by a function in @xmath2 .",
    "this theorem allows for the construction of a class of groups satisfying the @xmath2-srbc conjecture , modeled on the class of groups originally considered by the first author in @xcite and independently by chadha and passi in @xcite , and extended to a slightly larger class by emmanouil in @xcite .",
    "it also allows for direct verification of the @xmath5-srbc conjecture for a large and important class of groups , as given by the following theorem .",

    "let @xmath3 be a semihyperbolic group in the sense of @xcite . if @xmath30 satisfies the nilpotency condition",
    ", then it satisfies the @xmath2-nilpotency condition for any bounding class @xmath2 containing @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath26 has finite cohomogical dimension over @xmath50 for each non - elliptic class @xmath15 , then @xmath30 satisfies @xmath2-srbc for all bounding classes @xmath2 containing @xmath49 .",
    "by @xcite the centralizer subgroups @xmath51 are quasi - convex subgroups of the ( linearly ) combable group @xmath30 , hence each @xmath51 is combable and quasi - isometrically embedded into @xmath30 . by @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite",
