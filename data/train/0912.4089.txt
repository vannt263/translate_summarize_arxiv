    "the main aim of nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies is to create a thermalized system of quarks and gluons - mimicking the situation that prevailed after few microsecond of the big bang .",
    "the expansion time scale in the microsecond old universe is much larger than the interaction time scale of quarks and gluons .",
    "consequently during the evolution the system maintains equilibrium . in the case of heavy ion collisions ( hic ) , however , these time scales have comparable magnitude . for hic the two pertinent issues for the equilibration are ( i ) do the quarks and gluons achieve equilibrium and ( ii ) in case they do , can the equilibrium be maintained during the evolution ? or what kinds of eos and interaction cross sections are required for the maintenance of equilibration . some of these issues will be addressed in the present work .",
    "to address the first issue the time evolution of average momentum ( @xmath0 ) of the quarks and gluons have been studied and compare with its equilibrium value . in relaxation time approximation it can be shown that the evolution of the @xmath0 is governed by the equation : @xmath1 @xmath2 is the relaxation time evaluated with pqcd cross section for @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the value of @xmath5 in equilibrium .",
    "the equilibrium time , @xmath6 is obtained from the condition : @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "it has been found that the value @xmath6 depends weakly on initial value of @xmath0 .    to address the second issue",
    "we assume that the quarks and gluons produced initially in thermal equilibrium and check whether it can maintain the equilibrium during the entire evolution processes by comparing their scattering rates with the expansion rate of the matter .",
    "the scattering time scales ( @xmath9 ) of various partons are evaluated in pqcd and these time scales are compared with the expansion time scale ( @xmath10 ) . for maintenance of thermal equilibrium",
    "the following criteria should be satisfied : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , is a constant .",
    "the criteria given in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] is reverse to the one used to study the freeze - out of various species of particles during the evolution of the early universe  @xcite .",
    "similar condition is used in heavy ion collisions also to study freeze - out of hadrons  @xcite . physically eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] means that the time taken by a partons to travel a distance of one mean free path by their thermal motion they have collectively receded from each other by less than one mean free path  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 is determined for parton types @xmath13 by the expression @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total cross section for particles @xmath13 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the relative velocity between @xmath13 and @xmath16 and @xmath18 is the density of the particle type @xmath16 in the medium .",
    "the scattering time scales for partons have been calculated by taking into account the following leading order processes @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 for light flavours and gluons  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath24 stands for light quarks and @xmath25 denotes gluons . for evaluating @xmath9 for heavy quarks ( @xmath26 )",
    "the pqcd processes are taken from  @xcite .",
    "the infrared divergence appearing in case of massless particle exchange in the @xmath27-channel has been shielded by debye mass .    the expansion time scale can be defined as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the energy density at a proper time @xmath30 and radial co - ordinate @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath29 is obtained by solving the hydrodynamical equation : @xmath32 with the assumption of boost invariance along longitudinal direction  @xcite and cylindrical symmetry of the system  @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath33 is the energy momentum tensor , @xmath34 is the pressure , @xmath35 denotes four velocity and @xmath36 stands for metric tensor .",
    "we consider a net baryon free qgp here , therefore the baryonic chemical potential ( @xmath37 ) is zero .",
    "the expansion rates for rhic and lhc energies have been calculated using the initial conditions , @xmath38 mev , @xmath39 fm for rhic which gives @xmath40 and @xmath41 mev , @xmath42 fm for lhc giving @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "the initial radial velocity has been taken as zero .",
    "two sets of equation of state ( eos ) have been used to study the sensitivity of the results on eos .",
    "set - i : in a first order phase transition scenario - we use the bag model eos for the qgp phase and for the hadronic phase all the resonances with mass @xmath44 gev have been considered  @xcite . and",
    "set - ii : the eos is taken from lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations performed by the milc collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath0 obtained by solving eq .  [ boltzmann ]",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for a system of quarks and gluons .",
    "the results with pqcd interactions indicate that the quarks are unlikely thermalize both at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the possibility of gluon thermalization at lhc is very strong .",
    "the gluon thermalization time scale seems to comparable to the life time of the qgp at rhic energies indicating that the gluons may remain out of equilibrium during the evolution .",
    "however , any non - perturbative effects may drive the system faster toward equilibrium .    in fig  [ fig2 ]",
    "the scattering time scale is contrasted with the expansion time scale for rhic energy for two types of eos mentioned above .",
    "expansion rate for both the eos is similar at early time but differ little at the late stage of the evolution .",
    "for the sake of comparison the expansion rate for the extreme case of free streaming is also displayed .",
    "the scattering rates are evaluated with pqcd cross sections ( left panel ) .",
    "the condition for equilibration in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] indicates that the gluons remains close to equilibrium , however the charm and bottom ( not shown in the figure ) quarks remain out of equilibrium during the entire evolution history .",
    "the analysis of the experimental data within the ambit of relativistic hydrodynamics suggest that the matter formed in au+au collisions at rhic achieve thermalization .",
    "one possible reasons for the thermalization to occur is that the partons interact strongly after their formation .",
    "it is argued in  @xcite that the onset of thermalization in the system formed in heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies can not be achieved without non - perturbative effects .",
    "it has also been shown in  @xcite that a large enhancement of the pqcd cross section is required for the reproduction of experimental data on elliptic flow at rhic energies .",
    "therefore , the pqcd cross sections used to derive the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( left panel ) should include non - perturbative effects . to implement this we enhance the pqcd cross sections by a factor of 2 .",
    "the resulting scattering time is compared with the expansion time in fig .  [ fig2 ] ( right panel ) .",
    "it is observed that the gluons are kept in equilibrium throughout the evolution , light quarks are closer to the equilibrium as compared to the heavy flavours .    in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] the results for lhc are displayed for the two time scales mentioned above for pqcd and enhanced cross sections . the expansion becomes faster at lhc than rhic because of the higher internal pressure . as a consequence ,",
    "it is interesting to note that the thermalization scenario at lhc does not differ drastically from rhic .",
    "we have evaluated the rate of scattering of various partons in qgp and compared the scattering time scale with the expansion time scale to examine whether the evolving mater is in thermal equilibrium or not . it is found that gluons remain close to equilibrium throughout the evolution .",
    "quarks gets equilibrated at the late stage of the evolution both for rhic and lhc energies .",
    "enhancement of pqcd cross sections and realistic lqcd eos drives the system toward equilibrium faster ."
