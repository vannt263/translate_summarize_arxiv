    "the discovery  @xcite of high temperature superconductivity has initiated great experimental and theoretical efforts which aimed at a detailed understanding of these materials . nevertheless , a generally accepted theory which explains at least the most important properties of the high temperature superconductors could not yet be presented which is possibly related to the complex electronic structures of these materials .    therefore , very early on ab - initio methods have been employed to determine the electronic properties of these materials .",
    "mostly , band - structure techniques have been employed which are reviewed in ref .",
    "in our contrasting approach to electronic structure calculations , we use cluster techniques in the framework of spin - polarized density functional theory with localized basis functions which are especially well suited for the calculation of local properties .",
    "in particular , the cluster method has been successfully applied to the determination of charge and spin - density distributions in the cuprate plane and to a reasonably accurate evaluation of electric field gradients and magnetic hyperfine fields for planar copper and oxygen nuclei in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1and 7 using clusters comprising five planar copper and their nearest neighboring planar and apical oxygen atoms  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", these calculations are extended to include clusters representative of la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , 6 , 7 , yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , and to some extent of nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "the development of both hard- and software has led to a significant improvement of the quality of our calculations by use of larger clusters comprising up to thirteen planar copper atoms .",
    "this allows a careful study of the convergence of the calculated local properties with respect to the cluster size .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we will first outline the cluster technique and introduce the used clusters in sec .",
    "[ sec : comput ] .",
    "[ sec : spin ] is devoted to a discussion of the spin distribution and contains estimations of exchange couplings in the cuprates . in sec .",
    "[ sec : efg ] we report on the calculation of electric field gradients ( efg ) at the planar copper sites in the different cuprates .",
    "the convergence of the results with respect to the cluster size is demonstrated and the various contributions of the molecular orbitals ( mo ) and atomic orbitals ( ao ) to the efg are elucidated .",
    "the calculated distribution of charges and holes reveals that the 3@xmath4 ao of the copper is not fully occupied .",
    "the doping dependence of these distributions and of the efg are evaluated and compared to nuclear quadrupole resonance data .",
    "[ sec : hyp ] contains a careful examination of hyperfine parameters and their disentanglement into on - site and transferred contributions .",
    "calculations of chemical shieldings are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : chem ] and in particular , the role of the reference substance for magnetic shifts of the copper is discussed .",
    "the paper is terminated with the summary and conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the idea of the cluster technique is to select a contiguous region out of the solid and to treat the electrons therein with standard many - body theories .",
    "this so - called core region is surrounded by a shell of basis - free pseudopotentials which prevent the electrons to be attracted by positive point charges and provide smooth boundary conditions .",
    "the core and the boundary regions are embedded in a large lattice of background point charges to ensure a very good approximation for the madelung potential . in the case of the two undoped parent compounds , la@xmath0cuo@xmath1  and 6 , the values chosen for the background point charges are based on the formal valence of the constituents . in clusters representative of 7 and yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2",
    "the formal valences had to be slightly modified to reach charge neutrality .",
    "the calculations were performed in the framework of spin - polarized density functional theory which provides a good trade - off between accuracy and computational cost .",
    "( hartree - fock theory , which completely neglects correlation effects , yields poor results .",
    "in contrast , configuration interaction methods , which correctly include both exchange and correlation effects in their hamiltonian , require enormous computer resources and are currently prohibitive for the cluster sizes considered here . ) for the representation of the exchange and correlation functionals , the potentials of becke  @xcite and lee , yang , and parr  @xcite , have been used .",
    "all atoms in the core region of the clusters employ the standard triple zeta basis sets ( 6 - 311 g ) . for the determination of the ground state of the many - electron system and the evaluation of the observed quantities , the gaussian03 quantum chemistry software package  @xcite",
    "was used .",
    "it is desirable to have as many atoms as possible in the core region , but the available computer resources and the convergence of the self - consistent field procedure are the limiting factors in this respect . as already mentioned , these limits have been pushed further since our first use of the cluster technique ( see ref .",
    "[ ] ) which now allows to use larger clusters including up to nearly 1000 electrons .    in this work we present results for clusters comprising 5 , 9 , and 13 planar copper atoms together with their nearest planar and apical oxygen atoms for clusters representative of la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , 6 , 7 , yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , and nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "in table  [ tbl : clusters ] the constitutive properties of all the used clusters for every substance are listed .",
    "the layout of the cuo@xmath0 plane for the three cluster sizes is displayed in fig .",
    "the lattice constants and the positions of the atoms in the unit cells for the three clusters of the y - family were chosen according to experimental structure determinations and are taken from refs .",

    "we have performed large - scale ab - initio cluster computations of cuprates in order to determine the local electronic structure .",
    "the convergence of these local properties with respect to the cluster size is very good .",
    "an analysis of the charge and spin distribution in terms of contributions from the various mo and ao reveals distinguished features in all compounds under consideration .",
    "first , the copper 3@xmath7 ao is occupied by about 1.4 and the 3@xmath4 ao by about 1.9 electrons .",
    "the oxygen 2@xmath8 ao contains roughly 1.65 electrons .",
    "this implies a total of 1.4 intrinsic holes per unit which is compensated by @xmath9 electrons in the copper 4@xmath10 ao .",
    "these partial occupancies of the non - spherical ao mainly determine the efg values .",
    "the 4@xmath10 ao is involved in the transferred hyperfine field .",
    "good agreement between the calculated and measured copper efg is found .",
    "the efg values essentially depend on the differences between the mulliken populations of the 3@xmath4 and the 3@xmath7 ao .    simulating doping by two different methods",
    "shows that all these occupancies smoothly change and the general trends of changing copper efg with doping level are reproduced .",
    "the removal of one electron by a dopant atom in the intra - layer induces only half a hole in the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "the other half is in out - of - plane orbitals .",
    "spin - polarized calculations with various spin multiplicities enabled the determination of the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling and the various hyperfine fields .",
    "the contribution of the spin - orbit coupling , however , has only been approximately determined .",
    "the calculated total hyperfine fields are in rough agreement with those deduced from experiments .",
    "the values for the sum @xmath11 are small but differ considerably among the substances under consideration .",
    "this in sharp contrast to the requirements set by the temperature independence of the copper knight - shift @xmath12 observed in very different cuprates .",
