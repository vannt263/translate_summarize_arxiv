    "a major recent discovery took place in neutrino astroparticle physics : the icecube detector has reported the detection of two pev neutrinos , a roughly @xmath3 excess above expected background rates  @xcite , see also  @xcite for an interpretative paper .",
    "these events were found at the lower energy edge of an analysis optimized to search for cosmogenic neutrino cascade events , but the tentative signal does not have the rate and energy properties expected for such an origin . when the search criteria were extended to both cascade and track events of lower energies , an excess was found in the tens of tev range  @xcite . by now , there is little doubt that this represents a discovery of a neutrino source of some kind , with evidence of the excess exceeding @xmath4 .",
    "the most pressing and exciting issue remains to establish the nature of source(s ) .",
    "in fact , the signal found has some intriguing features : while harder than the backgrounds , it does not seem to extend in energy much above a few pev , otherwise more energetic cascade events should have been detected .",
    "also , albeit not yet statistically significant , there seems to be a deficit of events in the decade of energy just below the pev pair , compared with expectations based on a simple power - law flux ranging from @xmath5(10 ) tev to pev scale .",
    "the arrival directions of the events also seem incompatible with an angular distribution peaked along the galactic plane , while being compatible with an isotropic flux . nonetheless , some enhancement toward inner galaxy is not excluded .",
    "these features , together with some more general considerations , suggest that a significant fraction of events may originate in extragalactic sources , albeit presenting a spectral softening or cutoff suppression at @xmath6ev / nucleon primary energy .",
    "this can be obtained in realistic astrophysical models , like the starburst galaxies one in  @xcite , perhaps by stretching a bit the parameters .",
    "some moderate galactic component is anyway well consistent with the data and may be useful for diagnostics ( a model of this kind has been presented for example in  @xcite ) .",
    "all in all , astrophysical explanations for the observed flux are certainly viable . yet , some intriguing features of the observed events leave room for alternative , non - standard physics interpretations . for example , in  @xcite , the `` pev excess '' was interpreted as s - channel enhancement of neutrino - quark scattering by a 0.6 tev mass leptoquark . also , in  @xcite , the peculiar closeness in energy of the two pev events was interpreted as due to a `` neutrino - line '' decay from heavy dark matter ( dm ) candidates .    here",
    ", we explore the possibility that _ all _ of the above mentioned events ( not only the couple of pev cascades ) may be due to dm decay .",
    "we point out that the case for a dm interpretation might be quite interesting for a number of reasons :    * the lack of signals of new physics at ( sub-)tev scale at lhc till now certainly weakens the case for `` wimp '' candidates for dm .",
    "if one relaxes the `` theoretical prior '' for electroweak scale candidates , there is no reason to dismiss much heavier particles as an explanation of dm , lacking any other preferred energy scale .",
    "* the pev range has a peculiar feature : it is natural to expect a _",
    "neutrino - first _",
    "detection , for reasons which have nothing to do with dm .",
    "gamma rays have a galactic - sized mean free path at these energies , due to pair - production on the cmb .",
    "electrons also lose energy very rapidly , thus leaving neutrinos as a channel of choice for indirect detection .",
    "in fact , for any candidate well above the tev scale neutrinos offer significant advantages as probe  @xcite . * as we shall detail below , the kind of spectral signal observed by icecube may be _ generic _ for a wide class of unstable dm candidates with a mass in the right ballpark . differently from what explored in  @xcite",
    ", there is no need to single out very peculiar final states to explain the main features of the data . also , we point out that dm decay predicts a very specific angular signal , which is qualitatively in agreement with what observed and may provide a further empirical test of the model , once further statistics will be collected .",
    "the third item above requires to be made explicit .",
    "we devote to this purpose sec .",
    "[ signal ] below .",
    "the rest of the article is composed as follows : in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present our results for a few relevant cases ; finally , in sec .  [ conclusions ] we discuss our findings and conclude .",
    "here we closely follow  @xcite for methodology and notation . for more general notions on decaying dm models with an emphasis on their indirect detection prospects ,",
    "see also the recent review  @xcite , while for the earliest suggestion to use this kind of probe see  @xcite .",
    "we just summarize the basic inputs below , while addressing to these references for more details .",
    "first , it is important to realize that the neutrino flux from dm decay has both a galactic and an extragalactic contributions . differently from the annihilating dm case ,",
    "were the former term ( galactic ) usually dominates on the latter ( extragalactic ) , for decaying dm they are roughly comparable in flux , although different in angular distribution and in spectral shape .",
    "the decay of dm particles in the milky way halo leads to the following differential flux : @xmath7 \\ ; ,    \\label{halo - flux}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the dm mass and lifetime ; @xmath10 is the density profile of dm particles in our galaxy as a function of distance from the galactic center , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the energy spectrum of neutrinos produced in the decay of a dm particle .",
    "the neutrino flux received at earth depends on the galactic coordinates , longitude @xmath13 and latitude @xmath14 , and is given by a line - of - sight integral over the parameter @xmath15 , which is related to @xmath11 by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the distance of the sun to the galactic center .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the average flux over the full sky , the result being @xmath18 for our numerical analysis we will adopt a navarro - frenk - white density profile  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath11 is the distance to the galactic center , @xmath20 is the critical radius and @xmath21 , which yields a dm density at the solar system @xmath22  @xcite . for this choice of parameters , @xmath23 note however that the decaying dm flux does not suffer from the large uncertainties related to the poor knowledge of the inner galaxy profile .",
    "lacking the quadratic enhancement in the signal proper of annihilating candidates , the role of the ( better determined ) local density is more prominent .",
    "we can thus anticipate little dependence of our conclusions on the specific choice made above .",
    "in addition to the neutrino flux from decay of dm particles in the milky way halo , there is a second contribution stemming from the dm decays at cosmological distances , which produces an isotropic diffuse neutrino flux .",
    "the differential flux with respect to the received neutrino energy is given by : @xmath24 ,    \\label{eqn : nufluxeg}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the hubble expansion rate as a function of redshift @xmath26 and @xmath27 denotes the critical density of the universe . throughout this work",
    "we assume a @xmath28cdm cosmology with parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , as derived from planck temperature map data ( see table  2 in  @xcite ) . similarly to eq .",
    "( [ eq : halo ] ) , one can write @xmath33}{\\sqrt{\\omega_\\lambda+\\omega_{\\rm m}(1+z)^3}}\\ , ,    \\label{eqn : nufluxeg2}\\ ] ] with @xmath34 which clearly suggest the similar magnitude of the galactic and extragalactic signals .",
    "essentially , the three unknowns are @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath35 .",
    "if , as in  @xcite , one assumes that the dm decays basically in monochromatic neutrino line , the two pev events fix both the mass and the lifetime , within factors of @xmath36(1 ) .",
    "however , for most dm models , a decay into neutrino lines is a sub - leading channel , with larger branching ratios are found in other sm final states .",
    "hence , more generically it is the lower - energy continuum that fixes @xmath9 , with the highest energy events fixing the branching ratio into hard ( or monochromatic ) neutrino channels ( denoted @xmath37 in the following ) , as well as the pev - mass scale of the particle .    remarkably , for a rough prediction of the spectral shape @xmath35 no detailed model of the dm sector is required .",
    "phenomenologically , neutrino spectra from heavy particle decays / annihilations present both a hard and a soft component , denoted respectively with `` h '' and `` s '' .",
    "the former one comes from final states containing `` primary '' neutrinos ( such as a pair of neutrinos , @xmath38 , etc . ) , but to some extent also other charged leptons , notably electron . on the other hand , other channels , and in particular those involving light quarks ( @xmath39 ,",
    "here denoted as @xmath40 ) , lead to significantly softer spectra .",
    "hence we simply parameterize the spectrum as @xmath41 in the following section we will show some examples of spectra , specifying the `` s '' and `` h '' tree - level modes .    additionally , it has been appreciated since more than a decade that electroweak cascades are an important ingredient at center - of - mass energies of the order of pev or larger  @xcite .",
    "needless to say , also qcd parton jets play an important role , either because qcd final state is directly present ( as in the soft channel of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : modspectr ] ) ) or , at very least , as byproduct of the electroweak cascades . in order to account for this effect ,",
    "we rescale the results presented in  @xcite for a 0.1 pev annihilating dm  whose spectra are available numerically at  @xcite  for few pev candidates .",
    "note that the ignorance of the dm model details , together with intrinsic theoretical error on the spectra prevents a precise calculation .",
    "additionally , the current limited statistics would make it probably unnecessary .",
    "hence , the spectra used should be intended as `` educated guesses '' , illustrative of the qualitatively expected shape , rather than detailed predictions .",
    "remarkably , as illustrated in the following section , with these generic ingredients and a minimal set of assumptions for dm physics , it appears rather easy to reproduce the `` unusual '' spectral shape hinted to by the data .",
    "this framework also lead to quite specific predictions , which can be falsified once sufficient statistics will be collected .",
    "the galactic and extragalactic components of the neutrino flux at the earth readily follow by plugging @xmath35 into eq .",

    "( [ eqn : nufluxeg ] ) , respectively .",
    "our _ benchmark case _ is the choice @xmath42 for the hard channel and @xmath43 for the soft one .",
    "we also account for the neutrino mixing _ en route _ from production point to the earth . due to neutrino flavor oscillation , flux of @xmath44 at earth",
    "is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes probability of @xmath47 oscillation and @xmath48 represents the flux in @xmath49 flavor at the source .",

    "( [ eqn : modspectr ] ) can be @xmath70 or @xmath71 final states and the hard channels can be replaced by @xmath72 channel .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : diffspectra ] , the required shape of energy spectrum is recurring in all the shown channels .",
    "the @xmath72 channel shows the importance of ew corrections ( which are in fact quite large ! ) : despite the fact that no hard neutrino channel is present at tree level , a sufficiently hard neutrino spectrum can be still obtained with a 40% branching ratio in @xmath72 , thanks to the major role played by cascade radiation of massive gauge bosons ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this fact may appear surprising , so we provide in the following a qualitative justification .",
    "first of all , even if one mostly radiates  soft \" gauge bosons , in a splitting process ( say @xmath73 ) both the soft and the hard neutrino spectra are populated : the low - energy one via the soft ( single or multiple ) @xmath74 decay process and the high - energy one via the @xmath75 s which the electrons have converted into . secondly , while naively these processes are suppressed by a power of @xmath76 ( weak fine structure ) with respect to the three level , the presence of large logarithmic factor ( of the type @xmath77 ) makes these  corrections \" sizable for massive particles , at the level of 10% or larger of the tree - level result ( for more technical details see e.g.  @xcite ) . as a consequence , by varying both lifetime and branching ratio within a factor of",
    "only a few with respect to the naive fit obtained with the @xmath67 tree - level diagram , one is capable of fitting the spectrum even in the absence of tree - level neutrino emission . from the model building point of view",
    ", a dm decay to @xmath72 and @xmath67 can be naturally constructed from the coupling of dm to the weak su(2 ) lepton doublet @xmath78 . for an equal decay branching ratio in the two components of the doublet ,",
    "the corresponding modification of the parameters @xmath79 with respect to the pure @xmath67 case best fit parameters is thus less than a factor 2 .",
    "other choices for the final states ( including for example massive gauge bosons , top quark and muon / tau leptons ) would also produce spectra roughly compatible with observations , but for illustrative purposes in the following we shall concentrate on our benchmark case which presents the most marked differences with respect to a featureless power - law spectrum of astrophysical origin .",

    "the result of our analysis is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : spectrum ] and a generic @xmath2 spectrum , respectively ; and the black points with error bars show the observed events .",
    "the following comments about fig .",
    "[ fig : events ] are in order :    * the branching ratio @xmath63 of @xmath62 is fixed mainly by requiring two pev events , i.e. the last energy bin . * the dm lifetime @xmath83",
    "s is mainly determined by the low energy part of events .",
    "let us mention that the assumed value of dm lifetime is compatible with the lower limit on @xmath9 obtained e.g. in  @xcite from the data of icecube-22  @xcite , but the two can not be compared at face value . in fact , two issues should be taken into account : _ i _ ) the lower limit in  @xcite is calculated with the assumption of @xmath84 , and as described there , the limit should be scaled for lower @xmath37 ; _ ii _ ) the monochromatic neutrino spectra used in  @xcite are sharper ( and the bounds correspondingly stronger ) than the ones used here .",
    "in particular , in  @xcite the ew corrections are not taken into account .",
    "ew corrections decrease the height of sharp line at @xmath61 , as well as broadening it and introducing a smooth spectrum at low energy : as a consequence the lower limit weakens . recalculating the lower limit on lifetime for the dataset of  @xcite and the flux used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : events ] ) gives @xmath85s ( at 90% c.l . ) for @xmath53pev , which is compatible with the assumed value in this paper .",
    "our benchmark value is also consistent with the bounds derived in  @xcite .",
    "* since the maximum energy of each neutrino from dm decay is @xmath61 , a sharp cut in the number of events exists for @xmath86  pev , automatically matching the lack of observed events above the pev _ and _ the two observed events at the pev .",
    "for comparison , to accommodate a @xmath2 spectrum with the excess from @xmath87tev to pev scale , merely @xmath88 events are expected in the high energy bin , while two have been measured   flux producing 2 expected events in that bin would at the same time exacerbate the tension with the sub - pev deficit and",
    "if extrapolated to high energies in absence of a cutoff , it would predict predict about seven events at supra - pev energies ( whereas none has been detected ) .",
    "] this upward fluctuation , while not significant ( having a probability @xmath89  20% ) adds to the _ three downward _ fluctuations in the three preceding sub - pev bins , where one event is observed whereas about 3 are expected , with a chance probability again of @xmath89  20% . since the highest energy observed events in icecube consists of the two pev events in the last bin of fig .",
    "[ fig : events ] , a pev scale dm decay interpretation naturally explains the data . clearly , the dm mass and the resulting cut in energy can be chosen within the current uncertainty of the highest event energy .",
    "the main features of our results are robust with respect to the exact value of dm mass . * in the lower energy bins ( below @xmath90  tev ) , an @xmath2 spectrum shows an agreement with the data comparable to ( and actually a bit better than ) our dm benchmark spectrum . but",
    "these bins are populated by both signal and background , with the latter ( from atmospheric neutrinos and muons ) being a more and more important component at lower energies ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in the first few energy bins of fig .",
    "[ fig : events ] almost half of the observed events can be interpreted as backgrounds . at @xmath91  tev ,",
    "on the other hand , the contribution of background events should be negligible . in a sense",
    ", it is the last four more energetic bins that represent the most meaningful discriminator between an astrophysical and a dm model , with the latter showing a clearly better agreement .",
    "of course , a typical astrophysical @xmath2 spectrum is still in marginal agreement with the data due to the low statistics , but its goodness of fit ( compared with alternative explanations ) will be tested more meaningfully within few years by the increasing exposure of icecube detector . *",
    "the desired spectral feature from dm decay in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] and the resulting energy distribution of events in fig .",
    "[ fig : events ] can be roughly reproduced with a variety of choices for the particle physics parameters and is not tied to the specific value of @xmath37 and decay channels used in fig .",
    "[ fig : events ] , as suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig : diffspectra ] .",
    "nonetheless , a dm mass in the range of @xmath92pev and a lifetime to branching ratio factor @xmath93s are rather generic , at least to reproduce the highest energy data .",
    "a unique and predictive feature of dm decay interpretation of icecube data , which is _ independent _ of the exact shape of the spectrum , is the expected anisotropy in observed events . due to the off - center position of the solar system in milky way , the halo component of the flux in eq .",
    "( [ halo - flux ] ) is larger in the direction of galactic center ( that is @xmath94 ) , see for example fig .",
    "a1 in  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the icecube data also show an excess in this direction , which corresponds to @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the declination ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed calculation of expected anisotropy in the case of dm decay requires information about direction dependence of exposure , which is not provided by the icecube collaboration .",
    "for illustrative purposes , however , note that about 20% of the galactic signal ( or about 15% of the total one ) should come from the inner 30@xmath97 around the galactic center , as opposed to less than 7% in the case of an isotropic flux .",
    "although these differences are probably too small to be probed with current statistics , significant diagnostic potential should be available in a decade or so of collecting time .",
    "note that this test would work even in the absence of a hard spectrum near the endpoint , i.e. @xmath98 .",
    "even a featureless dm spectrum dominated by soft neutrinos , in fact , would have the same angular characteristics described above .",
    "over the last year , evidence has been building up about the existence of a tev - to - pev diffuse neutrino flux , on the top of known backgrounds .",
    "however , the interpretation of the current signal is not yet clear .    here , we argued that some features are sufficiently intriguing that an explanation in terms of decaying dm seems worth exploring in more details .",
    "we showed that assuming that such a particle exists , with a lifetime allowed by present constraints and with reasonable final state spectra , it could fit quite easily the unusual energy - shape of the excess : in general , the sum of a hard ( e.g. leptonic ) and a soft ( e.g. hadronic ) final state , even accounting for ew as well as qcd cascade corrections , provides a much closer match to the measured shape of the excess than a simple astrophysical power - law close to @xmath2 . a better determination of the spectrum of the excess , in particular the behavior above @xmath99pev and in the decade just below it , @xmath100pev , should provide further clues in this sense : a dm explanation _ requires _ that a rapid drop   of the signal is observed above the endpoint of the spectrum , which must be below ( or equal to ) half of the dm particle mass .",
    "additionally , a sub - pev dip in the spectrum is frequently obtained , albeit its prominence depends somewhat on the exact final state channels .    also , we commented on the fact that this dm explanation has very peculiar predictions about the _ angular _ distribution of the events , which may be discriminated against either an isotropic flux or a galactic - plane enhanced flux , once sufficient statistics will be collected . for this task , the more numerous lower - energy events in the tens of tev range  which are less effective for spectral shape diagnostics  may prove essential .",
    "finally , we note that the neutrino flux is generically accompanied by a comparable flux of photons , whose extragalactic component is however degraded below @xmath101gev via electromagnetic cascades ( pair - production and inverse compton events ) initiated onto the extragalactic background light and the cmb .",
    "since the dm number density scales as @xmath102 , but the injected energy goes as @xmath8 , as long as most of the photons emitted initiate the cascades , the bound is basically calorimetric and these constraints on @xmath9 are almost mass - independent .",
    "existing studies quantify them in the range of @xmath103s ( see for example  @xcite and  @xcite ) , so certainly compatible with lifetime values required here , but not wildly larger .",
    "it is likely that a non - negligible fraction ( say , larger than @xmath104 ) of the diffuse flux at tens or hundreds of gev may be due to these dm secondary photons . in the future ,",
    "a better understanding of this flux , both from the experimental and the modeling side , may thus open a further possibility of diagnostics .",
    "in conclusion , opening the tev - pev astronomy window would represent , by itself , a seminal achievement for astrophysics .",
    "however , this will likely have implications for fundamental physics as well : for example , it has already been argued that proving the existence of some extragalactic component at pev energies would also imply a big improvement on bounds on lorentz violation in the neutrino sector  @xcite .",
    "eventually , it might well be that the recent discovery by icecube will offer a serendipitous solution to the long quest for dm identification .    at lapth ,",

    "<S> recent observations by icecube , notably two pev cascades accompanied by events at energies  @xmath0  tev , are clearly in excess over atmospheric background fluxes and beg for an astroparticle physics explanation . although some models of astrophysical accelerators can account for the observations within current statistics , intriguing features in the energy and possibly angular distributions of the events make worth exploring alternatives . here , we entertain the possibility of interpreting the data with a few pev mass scale decaying dark matter , with lifetime of the order of @xmath1s . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss generic signatures of this scenario , including its unique energy spectrum distortion with respect to the benchmark @xmath2 expectation for astrophysical sources , as well as peculiar anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> a direct comparison with the data show a good match with the above - mentioned features . </S>",
    "<S> we further discuss possible future checks of this scenario . </S>"
