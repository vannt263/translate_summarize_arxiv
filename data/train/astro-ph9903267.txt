    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are a rare type of stellar object characterized by their transient emission of bursts of hard x - rays and soft @xmath2-rays .",
    "bursts have been detected from three such sources from 1979 ( mazets et al .",
    "1981 ) until early 1998 ; two are in the galactic plane ( sgr  180620 , sgr  1900 + 14 ) and one is in the large magellanic cloud ( sgr  052666 ) .",
    "one of the first sgr bursts detected , the famous 1979  march  5 burst from sgr  052666 ( mazets et al . 1979 ) , provided a wealth of information about these sources ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) .",
    "this flare started with a short initial spike followed by a 3 minute train of coherent 8 s pulsations .",
    "a precise location of this burst was consistent with a young ( @xmath3 10@xmath4 year ) supernova remnant ( snr ) n49 ( cline et al . 1982 ) .",
    "the train of pulsations and the positional coincidence with the snr indicated that the burst source is a young , magnetized neutron star .",
    "pointed x - ray observations of sgr burst location regions have shown that each sgr has associated with it a persistent x - ray source ( murakami et al .",
    "1994 , hurley et al .",
    "1999a , rothschild et al . 1994 ) within or near a young snr ( kulkarni & frail 1993 , hurley et al .",
    "1999a , cline et al .",
    "furthermore , the persistent sources associated with the two galactic sgrs are x - ray pulsars ( kouveliotou et al",
    ". 1998a , hurley et al",
    ". 1999a ) which show secular spin down at a rate @xmath3 10@xmath5 s s@xmath6 ( kouveliotou et al . 1998a , 1999 ) .",
    "as argued by kouveliotou et al .",
    "( 1998a ) , this spin down is likely caused by magnetic dipole radiation which implies a neutron star dipole magnetic field of @xmath3 10@xmath7 gauss .",
    "these results have provided strong observational evidence in support of the idea that sgrs are strongly magnetized neutron stars or ` magnetars ' ( duncan & thompson 1995 ) .",
    "the majority of sgr bursts have durations less than 200 msec and are well characterized by optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung ( ottb ) spectra with temperatures @xmath0 @xmath3 30  40 kev ( kouveliotou 1995 ) . with the exception of the much more luminous march 5@xmath8 event and a similar bright flare detected recently from sgr  1900 + 14 ( hurley et al .",
    "1999c ) , sgr bursts reach peak luminosities up to @xmath3 10@xmath9 ergs sec@xmath6 , far exceeding the eddington luminosity for a 1.4 @xmath10 neutron star .",
    "a statistical study of bursts from sgr  180620 has shown that no correlation exists between the energy released in a burst and the time until the next burst ( laros et al .",
    "also , it was found that both burst peak fluxes and time intervals between bursts resemble truncated log - normal and log - normal distributions , respectively ( laros et al .",
    "1987 , hurley et al .",
    "a differential energy distribution of events follows a gutenberg - richter power law (  1.66 exponent ; gutenberg & richter 1956 ) with a maximum energy e@xmath11 ergs ( cheng et al .",
    "each of these statistical properties are consistent with characteristics of earthquakes , which suggests the sgr bursts may be triggered by neutron star crustquakes ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) .    here , we report the discovery of sgr  162741 , the first new sgr to be detected since 1979 .",
    "we provide information on general burst characteristics and the persistent x - ray emission and draw comparisons to other sgrs . like the other sgrs",
    ", this sgr is associated with a persistent x - ray source and the young snr , g337.00.1 .",
    "during a period of intense burst activity from sgr  1900 + 14 , the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ; fishman et al .",
    "1989 ) trigger criteria were optimized to detect sgr burst events . on 1998",
    "june 15 , three consecutive batse triggered bursts short in duration and having soft spectra , originated from a region of the sky which was inconsistent with the three known sgr locations .",
    "two days later , batse detected another 17 events from the same region , confirming the existence of a new sgr , sgr  162741 ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998b ; source name based upon initial batse location ) . over the course of the next month and a half",
    ", a total of 99 bursts from this source were detected with batse , 39 of which triggered the instrument .",
    "figure 1 shows the observed burst rate as seen with batse .",
    "the bursts from sgr  162741 last between 25 msec and 1.8 sec with most burst durations clustering near 100 msec . in figure 2",
    ", we show some representative burst profiles .",
    "this small sample shows the diverse temporal variability observed in bursts from this source .",
    "the longest event ( figure 2d ) is similar to two bursts seen from sgr  1900 + 14 with respect to both spectrum and temporal structure .",
    "these bursts are much longer than typical sgr events and have very smooth temporal profiles with abrupt @xmath2-ray emission start and end points .    due to the rapid succession of bursts on june 17 and 18 , only limited",
    "fine spectral data for a given trigger were read out from the spacecraft before the next trigger , making detailed spectral reconstruction impossible for most bursts .",
    "of the 39 triggered bursts , fine spectral resolution data were available for only 8 events , including two very bright bursts ( figures 2c and 2d ) .",
    "in fact , these two bright bursts have the two highest peak count rates of any extra - solar event ever observed with batse .",
    "we fit power law , blackbody and ottb spectral models to those bursts , and find the ottb model best represents the time - integrated burst spectra of the six dim events and one of the two bright bursts ( figure 2d ) .",
    "the measured @xmath0 values of the six dim events range between 25  35 kev ; having a weighted mean of 27 kev .",
    "the spectral form of these six events agrees well with previous modeling of burst spectra from the other three sgrs ( see e.g. fenimore et al .",
    "1994 ) .    due to dead - time problems at the peak of the two bright bursts , we fit spectra taken at the tail of each event .",
    "for the longest event ( figure 2d ) , we find the tail spectrum is best fit by an ottb model with a @xmath12 kev .",
    "two spectra taken from the tail of the brightest event ( figure 2c ) are significantly harder than any other sgr  162741 burst spectrum measured with batse .",
    "furthermore , they are not consistent with one another , which shows spectral evolution exists for this event",
    ". the ottb and power law spectral models can not fit the first spectrum separately , but a combination of the two yields an acceptable fit . for this fit , the power law ( photon ) index @xmath13 and the ottb @xmath14 kev .",
    "the following spectrum taken is at a lower flux level and is much harder .",
    "we find this spectrum can be fit by a simple power law with an index @xmath15 .",
    "evidence for similar hard burst emission from sgr  180620 was found by strohmayer & ibrahim ( 1997 ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this @xmath16 , but it will be presented elsewhere ( woods et al .",
    "1999a ) .",
    "in order to estimate the peak fluxes of a larger sample of bursts , we applied the ottb model to bursts with coarse spectral resolution ( 4 channels ) and fair temporal resolution ( 64 msec ) .",
    "we assumed a fixed @xmath0 corresponding to the measured weighted mean value for the five dim events ( 27 kev ) and allowed only the normalization ( energy flux ) to vary .",
    "one drawback to this method is that many bursts reach their peak flux for only a short time , less than 64 msec , so these peak flux measurements will underestimate the true peak flux for some events . given the limited data availability , however , this time scale provided the largest sample of events .",
    "figure 3 shows the cumulative peak flux distribution on the 64 msec time scale for 57 events .",
    "the observed peak fluxes range over 3 orders of magnitude between @xmath17 and @xmath18 ergs @xmath19 sec@xmath6 .",
    "dead - time effects for the two brightest events were excessive , so these peak flux measurements ( 1.1 and 0.51 @xmath20 ergs @xmath19 sec@xmath6 ) can be treated as lower limits . the dashed line represents a power law fit to this distribution which has an exponent @xmath21 .",
    "no turnover is seen for this distribution out to @xmath18 ergs @xmath19 sec@xmath6 .",
    "we also constructed a cumulative burst fluence distribution for these events , which has a slightly flatter slope of @xmath22 .",
    "the differential fluence ( energy ) distribution then has an exponent equal to  1.5 , which agrees well with the the gutenberg - richter power law index (  1.66 ) .    using the batse triggers ,",
    "the burst source was coarsely located ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998b ) at @xmath23 = 16@xmath24 27@xmath25 and @xmath26 =  41@xmath27 ( j2000 ) with an error circle of radius 2@xmath27 .",
    "detection of sgr events by both batse and the ulysses spacecraft provided a narrow location annulus 1.7@xmath28 wide ( hurley et al .",
    "1998a ) . using batse earth occultation constraints",
    ", we limited the allowable range along the annulus to 1.5@xmath27 ( woods et al .",
    "1998 ; figure 4 ) .",
    "a more detailed account of the localization of this sgr is reported in hurley et al .",
    "( 1999d ) and smith et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in view of the association of sgrs with young snrs",
    ", we searched the whiteoak & green ( 1996 ) catalogue of snrs near the refined error box .",
    "a single snr , g337.00.1 ( sarma et al .",
    "1997 ) , was found ( woods et al . 1998 ) within the 1.5@xmath29 error box . with hopes of detecting an x - ray counterpart for this sgr , a too observation of this snr",
    "was initiated using the bepposax ( boella et al .",
    "1997a ) narrow field instruments ( nfis ) .",
    "two observations of snr g337.00.1 were performed on 1998 august 7 and again on september 16 .",
    "these observations revealed a previously undetected x - ray source ( sax  j1635.84736 ) at @xmath23 = 16@xmath24 35@xmath25 49.8@xmath30 and @xmath26 = 47@xmath27 35@xmath28 44@xmath31 ( j2000 ) with an error circle of radius 1@xmath28 ( 95% confidence ; figure 4 ) , consistent with the snr location .",
    "a known source , 4u1630472 , is also seen near the edge of the field of view for each observation .",
    "a light curve of the new source for each observation does not show any burst activity which is consistent with batse observations for those time periods ( see figure 1 )",
    ". using the low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ; parmar et al .",
    "1997 ) and two medium energy concentrator spectrometers ( mecs ; boella et al .",
    "1997b ) , we fit the spectrum of sax  j1635.84736 from 0.1  10 kev .",
    "the spectrum is well represented by a power law with interstellar absorption . under the assumption that the spectral form ( i.e. the power law index and hydrogen column density ) remains constant between observations",
    ", we fit the observations simultaneously allowing only the normalization to vary between the two .",
    "we get an acceptable fit with a reduced @xmath32 value of 0.92 for 160 degrees of freedom and find a power law ( photon ) index @xmath23 =   2.5  @xmath33  0.2 and a column density n@xmath34 = ( 7.7  @xmath35  @xmath19 .",
    "the unabsorbed flux ( 2  10 kev ) declines between the observations ( 40.3 days ) from @xmath36 ergs  @xmath19  sec@xmath6 to @xmath37 ergs  @xmath19  sec@xmath6 . assuming this source is located within the snr , the distance is 11 kpc ( sarma et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the source luminosity is then 9.7  @xmath38  10@xmath39  ergs  sec@xmath6 and 7.6  @xmath38  10@xmath39  ergs  sec@xmath6 for the two observations .    using standard sax analysis techniques ,",
    "source counts were extracted from the combined mecs units for sax  j1635.84736 and binned at 0.5 sec time resolution .",
    "we then performed a fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the 1998 august light curve searching frequencies from 0  1 hz and found the largest value in the power density spectrum was at 0.156 hz .",
    "although not very significant by itself , the corresponding period falls within the tight range of observed periods ( 5  8 sec ) for the other sgrs . using the barycenter corrected time tags , we ran an epoch fold search about the period corresponding to the highest power , which revealed a marginally significant peak ( 6  @xmath40 chance probability taking into account the number of trials ; 1500 between 6.38 and 6.44 sec ) at 6.41318(3 ) sec ( jd = 2451032.5 ) .",
    "the nearly sinusoidal pulse profile has an r.m.s .",
    "pulse fraction of 10.0  @xmath33  2.6  % .",
    "we performed the same analysis on the 1998 september observation , but did not find any significant peak in the power density spectrum near 0.156 hz or anywhere else between 0  1 hz .",
    "however , given the weak signal found in august and the fact that 45% fewer source counts were recorded in the mecs units during the september observation , we would not expect to find this pulsed signal .",
    "we propose that sax  j1635.84736 is the x - ray counterpart to sgr  162741 .",
    "there are a number of observations discussed here which support this claim .",
    "first , the position of sax  j1635.84736 is mutually consistent with the narrow error box for sgr  162741 ( hurley et al . 1999d , smith et al .",
    "1999 ) and the snr g337.00.1 .",
    "second , its spectrum is very similar to those found for the other sgr x - ray counterparts ( hurley et al .",
    "1999a ) . also , this x - ray source is variable near a burst active period for sgr  162741 which has also been found for the x - ray counterpart of sgr  1900 + 14 ( hurley et al .",
    "1999a , murakami et al .",
    "1999 , woods et al .",
    "finally , the marginal detection of pulsations at 6.4 sec , if confirmed , would agree well with the known spin periods of the three other sgrs which fall within a tight range of 5  8 sec ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998a , hurley et al",
    ". 1999a , mazets et al . 1979 ) .    for the distance of 11 kpc",
    ", g337.00.1 has a small diameter of @xmath3 5 pc ( sarma et al .",
    "there are only a few snrs this small ( see case & bhattacharya 1998 ) , and a large fraction of them are very young ( e.g. tycho , kepler , cas a ) .",
    "this suggests that g337.00.1 is also very young .",
    "the association of sgr  162741 with g337.00.1 strengthens the connection between sgrs and young snrs .",
    "given the distance to the snr g337.00.1 and assuming isotropic emission , the burst peak luminosities ( @xmath41 25 kev ) vary from 10@xmath42 to 10@xmath9 ergs sec@xmath6 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "paczynski ( 1992 ) suggested that sgr  0526 - 66 may have a critical luminosity @xmath3 @xmath43 ergs sec@xmath6 .",
    "he calculated the relation between the dipole magnetic field ( b@xmath44 ) of a neutron star and the critical luminosity ( l@xmath45 ) the magnetosphere will allow to escape in the limit where l@xmath46  l@xmath47 ( l@xmath47 is the standard eddington luminosity for a 1.4 @xmath10 neutron star ) .",
    "this relation is given by      where @xmath49 is the surface acceleration due to gravity .",
    "for sgr  052666 , paczynski found a dipole magnetic field of @xmath3 @xmath50 gauss , which agrees with independent estimates made by duncan & thompson ( 1992 ) .",
    "for sgr  162741 , we do not detect a turnover in the cumulative peak luminosity distribution , but we can place a lower limit on this value of @xmath51 ergs sec@xmath6 based upon the highest observed peak luminosity .",
    "this , in turn , places a lower limit on the magnetic field of the presumed magnetar associated with sgr  162741 of b@xmath52 gauss .",
    "this estimate may be confirmed with the definitive measurement of a pulse period and its derivative for sgr  162741 ."
