    "the shock - heated plasma in the wind - wind collision region ( wcr ) of massive stellar binaries can produce copious x - ray emission .",
    "the emission often displays orbital variability , which can result from changes to the occultation of the emitting region by the stars , to the attenuation through the stellar winds , and to the separation of the stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the post - shock plasma may exhibit signs of non - equilibrium ionization @xcite , and non - equilibrium electron and ion temperatures @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission is a useful probe of the underlying wind parameters .",
    "the hardness of the emission is related to the post - shock temperatures within the wcr , which in turn depends on the pre - shock wind speed .",
    "the x - ray brightness depends on the pre - shock density of the winds , while the absorption of soft x - rays through the circumstellar environment depends on the integrated density along sight lines to the wcr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "hence both the brightness and the degree of absorption provide information about the stellar mass - loss rates .",
    "although the x - ray emissivity is proportional to the square of the density , inhomogeneties can be rapidly smoothed out within adiabatic wcrs : thus the resulting x - ray emission may be relatively insensitive to the presence of clumps @xcite . since mass - loss rate estimates are often uncertain due to unknown wind clumping factors , an insensitivity to clumping potentially allows the x - ray emission from cwbs to provide accurate determinations of stellar mass - loss rates .",
    "recent observations in the uv have highlighted the uncertainty which still exists , with mass - loss rate estimates differing by factors of up to 100 with respect to other methods ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the energetic particles produce non - thermal radio emission via the synchrotron process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and non - thermal x - ray and @xmath1-ray emission from inverse compton cooling , neutral pion decay , and relativistic bremsstrahlung @xcite . the non - thermal radio emission can sometimes be spatially resolved ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "if the particle acceleration efficiency is sufficiently high , the thermal structure of the wcr may be affected , resulting in softer x - ray emission as the plasma becomes cooler and denser . in this way the characteristics of the thermal x - ray emission may also constrain the efficiency of particle acceleration .    models of the x - ray emission from colliding wind systems based on hydrodynamical simulations have , to date , been almost entirely performed in two - dimensions , with an underlying assumption of axissymmetry . while this approach is perfectly reasonable for wide systems with long orbital periods ,",
    "axissymmetry is a poor assumption in shorter period systems where orbital effects become important .",
    "though three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations have been presented by @xcite and @xcite , these works also assumed that the winds were instantaneously accelerated to their terminal velocities . in reality , the winds in short - period systems collide prior to reaching their terminal velocities , so realistic simulations must also account for the acceleration of each wind . in a new advance , three - dimensional models with radiatively driven winds were recently presented by ( * ? ? ?",

    "we produce synthetic x - ray spectra and lightcurves , and examine how these change with the viewing angle .",

    "comparisons to previous numerical models and observations are made in sections  [ sec : discuss_models ] and  [ sec : discuss ] , respectively .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] summarizes and concludes this work .",
    "the x - ray calculations in this paper are based on the three - dimensional hydrodynamical models described in paper  i. the models incorporate the radiative driving of the stellar winds ( based on the @xcite formalism , with the finite disk correction factor of @xcite ) , gravity , orbital effects , and cooling .",
    "the models were not designed to be of particular systems . rather , the aim was to obtain a better understanding of how the nature of the collision region depends on various key parameters .",
    "the models are summarized in tables  [ tab : models ] and  [ tab : stellar_params ] .",
    "the assumption of main sequence stars minimizes the effects of tidal distortions , which are not modelled .",

    "the x - ray emission from o+o - star cwbs has been investigated using fully hydrodynamical models @xcite and `` hydrid '' models @xcite .",
    "the analysis in the current work is a major improvement from that in @xcite , where the x - ray calculations were based on 2d axisymmetric hydrodynamical models in which the winds instantaneously accelerated to their terminal speeds . as such ,",
    "the plasma temperatures returned from model cwb1 are much lower than those from model a in @xcite . the hydrodynamical model underlying the analysis in @xcite did consider the radiatively - driven acceleration of the winds , but remained 2d @xcite .",
    "this has subsequently been shown to introduce an incorrect phase dependence to the volume of hot gas in the wcr @xcite .    in order to spatially resolve the post - shock cooling in highly radiative wcrs , @xcite introduced a model for the x - ray emission in which the local post - shock cooling was decoupled from a global solution of the ram - pressure balance .",
    "this work has the advantage of a low computational cost , allowing the rapid exploration of parameter space .",
    "however , its drawbacks include the neglect of orbital motion and the use of simple `` beta '' velocity - laws to mimic the winds acceleration .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve of an equal winds system ( model a ) shows two minima per orbit , with dual symmetry about both conjunction and quadrature ( this symmetry is broken in our models due to the aberration of the wcr ) .",
    "strong absorption occurs when the observer s line - of - sight is down one of the arms of the wcr .",
    "this signature is also seen from our model cwb1 , though is greatly reduced in strength , because of the downstream curvature of the wcr .",
    "three - dimensional colliding winds simulations of longer - period o+o systems ( with orbital periods of 1 month and 1 year ) , and eccentricity of 0.3 , have recently been presented by @xcite .",
    "this work solved the equations of ram - pressure balance assuming that the winds collide at their terminal velocities , and adopted an analytical expression for the abberation angle , to construct a 3d surface of the head of the wcr .",
    "further downstream , the gas in the wcr was assumed to behave ballistically , which with the orbital motion of the stars results in a downstream curvature of the wcr .",
    "again this approach benefits from its computational speed . the x - ray emission from this model",
    "was then calculated by mapping onto the surface of the wcr the emission calculated from a 2d hydrodynamical model . in all cases the wcr was assumed to be adiabatic .",
    "radiative transfer through the computational volume with the inclusion of opacity then allowed the generation of synthetic spectra and lightcurves .",
    "it was found that the x - ray flux generally followed a @xmath0 scaling , but could also display absorption related variations . while in principle the inclination and orientation of the system can be constrained from the shape of the x - ray lightcurve , in practice the lack of significant circumstellar absorption in o+o star systems with periods of order 1 yr will make this very difficult .",
    "the situation of course improves in shorter period systems , and in systems with reasonably disparate wind densities ( e.g. wr+o , lbv+o , and lbv+wr systems ) .",
    "in this section the results from our models are compared to recent x - ray observations of short period o+o - star systems .",
    "we focus first on systems where the wcr is expected to be highly radiative , then on systems where the wcr is expected to be more adiabatic , and then on systems with eccentric orbits and unequal winds .",
    "we finish by discussing the observational evidence for non - thermal x - ray emission .",
    "model cwb1 is similar to hd215835 ( dhcep ) , hd165052 , and hd159176 .",
    "the x - ray emission from each of these systems is discussed below .",
    "hd165052 is a double - lined binary which has recently been classified as o6.5v + o7.5v @xcite .",
    "the orbit is slightly eccentric ( e=0.09 ) , with an inclination thought to be around @xmath2 .",
    "this system was first considered as a cwb by @xcite .",
    "the nature of the wcr remains unclear .",
    "an analysis of the wind ram pressures reveals that there may be no balance at periastron , though this might be possible at apastron .",
    "the shocked winds are likely to both be radiative ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "a _ rosat _ lightcurve of hd165052 presented by @xcite was rephased to the correct 2.95d orbital period by @xcite .",
    "the lightcurve shows two minima per orbit , roughly centered on phases 0.0 and 0.5 ( conjunction ) , in good agreement with the lightcurves presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cwb123_xray_lc ] from model cwb1 .",

    "[ fig : cwb123_xray_lc ] .",
    "this difference may be caused by the slight orbital eccentricity , and/or may reflect the absence of a wind - wind balance or the unequal wind strengths .    unfortunately , hd165052 lies just outside the field - of - view of recent x - ray observations : a serendipitous _ xmm - newton _ observation of the lagoon nebula ( m8 ) and the very young open cluster ngc6530 @xcite centered on the non - thermal radio emitting o - star 9sgr @xcite , and _",
    "chandra _ observations of ngc6530 @xcite and 9sgr ( pi gagne , not published ) . dedicated observations of hd165052 are clearly necessary .",

    "xmm - newton _ in march 2001 @xcite .",
    "hd159176 has an orbital period of 3.367d , and a suspected inclination angle @xmath5 .",
    "since the stars ( and winds ) are identical the winds should collide at the system centre of mass , half - way between the stars .",
    "the collision should be radiative , even if the mass - loss rates are an order of magnitude lower than the values quoted in @xcite .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observation was taken just after quadrature , corresponding to phases @xmath6 ( or , alternatively , phase @xmath7 ) in our models ( note that the phase reported in de becker et al . is @xmath8 , but in their paper phase 0.0 corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the primary component ) .",
    "the observed luminosity in the @xmath9kev band is @xmath10 .",
    "[ fig : cwb123_xray_lc ] shows that the attenuated luminosity near quadrature in model cwb1 is , in fact , very similar to that observed from hd159176 .",
    "this is important , because theoretical models presented by @xcite which decoupled the local postshock cooling from the global dynamics of the wcr overpredicted the luminosity by at least a factor of 4 .",
    "a two - temperature mekal fit to the combined epic and rgs data yielded @xmath11kev and @xmath12kev , with a circumstellar column @xmath13 .",
    "the latter is in good agreement with the energy dependent column at quadrature from model cwb1 as shown in fig .",

    "we further find that for an inclination angle @xmath14 , at phase 0.25 the characteristic mekal temperatures from spectral fits to model cwb1 are @xmath15kev and @xmath16kev , and the circumstellar column to the hot component is @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the agreement is quite good .",
    "the slightly higher temperature of the hot component in the fit to the real data may indicate slightly higher pre - shock wind speeds than obtained in our model .",
    "hd215835 ( dhcep ) , located in the young open cluster ngc7380 , is an extremely tight o6v+o7v binary with a circular orbit of just 2.1109d period @xcite .",
    "the stars are tidally distorted , but at present are fully detached .",
    "the inclination remains slightly uncertain ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the significant optical polarization is consistent with scattering within a wcr , while its short - term variability may be related to instabilities in the wcr @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the wind ram pressures reveals that there is unlikely to be any balance , and the primary wind should directly impact the secondary star .",
    "however , once again a detailed simulation of this system will be necessary to place this hypothesis on a firmer footing .",

    ", we obtain @xmath34 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity and @xmath35 values are slightly higher than obtained from model cwb1 .",
    "it is entirely plausible that such a high x - ray luminosity could be obtained even if the primary wind crushes that of its companion , because in such a scenario the secondary star would nonetheless intercept a large fraction of the primary s wind due to its proximity .",
    "the slightly hotter temperature of the 2nd mekal component compared to model cwb1 may indicate that the primary wind indeed collides directly with the surface of the companion star , since it then has more room to accelerate before its collision , and thus the ability ( ignoring potential braking and inhibition effects - see @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) to reach higher pre - shock speeds .",
    "systems with slightly longer orbital periods and wider stellar separations , some of which bear similarities to model cwb2 , are now considered .",
    "specifically , observations of hd93161a and hd47129 ( plaskett s star ) are discussed .",
    "hd93161a is an o8v+o9v system with an orbital period of 8.566d .",
    "the mimimum masses from the orbital solution are quite large , which suggests that the inclination of the orbit is high , most probably @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the winds achieve a ram pressure balance , and both shocked winds are largely adiabatic ( the primary s more so : we estimate that @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "the system was observed five times with _ xmm - newton _ during 2000 and 2001 , but no significant variations at energies above 0.5kev were detected .",
    "this is nicely consistent with the theoretical lightcurves from model cwb2 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cwb123_xray_lc ] , which display little orbital variation in energy bands above 0.5kev due to : i ) the low attenuation through the circumstellar winds caused by the relatively low mass - loss rates and the relatively wide stellar separation , and ii ) low occultation due to the large size of the wcr relative to the stars .",
    "the observed luminosity in the @xmath9kev band is @xmath39 , which is an order of magnitude fainter than model cwb2 . at first glance",
    "this would appear to be a big problem , but there are two important factors which can reconcile this issue .",
    "firstly , the interstellar column to this system ( @xmath40 ) is significantly higher than assumed for our models . secondly , the winds in this system are likely to be much more feeble compared to the o6v winds assumed in our model . since the x - ray luminosity @xmath41 in adiabatic systems , a reduction of a factor of 3 or so in the mass - loss rates would bring the observed and theoretical luminosities into better agreement",
    ". such a reduction is consistent with the expected change in the mass - loss rate between an o6 and an o8/9 main - sequence star .",
    "@xcite find that two - temperature mekal fits to the x - ray spectra of hd93161a yield average values of @xmath42kev and @xmath43kev .",
    "the derived circumstellar column varies between @xmath44 ( at phases @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 ( at phase 0.75 ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite performed a 2-temperature fit to the combined data , finding temperatures of @xmath47kev and @xmath48kev .",
    "the hotter temperature from this fit is greater than the temperature of the hot component in any of the 5 individual spectra analyzed by @xcite .",
    "this highlights some of the non - uniqueness issues of spectral fits to medium - resolution spectra which is well documented in the literature .    in comparison",
    ", two - temperature mekal fits to model cwb2 are generally pretty poor ( typically @xmath49 ) , with three - temperatures needed to provide satisfactory fits . with this in mind , typical temperatures obtained from two - component fits are 0.25kev and 1.4kev , with the analysis of simulated _ chandra _ spectra returning higher temperatures for the hotter component ( @xmath50kev and @xmath51kev , at phase 0.0 and 0.25 , respectively ) than the corresponding analysis of a `` fake '' _ suzaku _ dataset ( @xmath52kev and @xmath53kev , at phase 0.0 and 0.25 , respectively ) .",
    "excluding one of the _ suzaku _ analyzes , the values of @xmath54 considerably exceed those reported from hd93161a , even the higher value found by @xcite .",
    "however , this is not too surprising given that the wind speeds of the o8v and o9v stars in hd93161a are likely to be considerably lower than those assumed from the o6v stars in model cwb2 .",
    "x - ray observations of systems containing evolved o - stars have also been presented in the recent literature .",
    "one notable analysis concerns plaskett s star ( hd47129 ) , an o8iii / i + o7.5iii system with a circular orbit of period 14.4d @xcite .",
    "the stars are very massive ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the primary and secondary star respectively , assuming an orbital inclination of @xmath57 ) .",
    "@xcite note that the secondary star is deformed due to its large rotational velocity , which results in a non - uniform temperature distribution , and speculate that the wind is confined near the equatorial plane . in this way",
    "the apex of the wcr can occur closer to the primary star ( even if its wind has the overall greater mass - loss rate ) , as suggested from the analysis of optical emission lines @xcite .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations of plaskett s star were presented by @xcite .",
    "while there appears to be a minimum in the observed count rate when the primary star is in front , the amplitude of variability remains uncertain , as it is quite small between two _ xmm - newton _ observations , but larger in archival _ rosat _ hri observations .",
    "there is a pressing need for additional data to resolve this issue , and to examine whether there is an additional minimum during each orbit .",
    "the interstellar absorbing column is @xmath58 @xcite , similar to the value assumed for our models .",
    "the observed @xmath31kev luminosity from the _ xmm - newton _ observations ( @xmath59 ) is also similar to the luminosities obtained in models cwb2 and cwb3 , while a minimum in the luminosity near phase 0.0 is again consistent with the models .",
    "there is some evidence ( e.g. a very faint fek line ) that the hot x - ray emitting plasma may not be in thermal equilibrium , or that there is a power - law tail to the hard emission .",
    "while the latter may indicate that non - thermal processes , such as particle acceleration , are occuring , it could also be an artifact of the fitting method : additional fits using a bremsstrahlung model to fit the continuum plus individual delta functions to fit the lines did not require a power - law component .",

    "it was observed twice by _ asca _ during 1997 , with the observations timed to coincide with periastron and apastron @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission is bright because of its relative proximity ( @xmath90pc ) .",
    "the observed @xmath31kev luminosities are @xmath91 in both pointings .",
    "since the wind attenuation is negligible , and the interstellar column is low ( @xmath92 ) , the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of this system is also relatively low , consistent with the relatively feeble winds in this system .",
    "surprisingly , there is no significant variation in the luminosity , spectral shape , or absorption between the periastron and apastron observations .",
    "possible explanations for this lack of variability are that the wcr stays pinned to the surface of the secondary star throughout the entire orbit , or that intrinsic shocks within the winds generated by the radiatively driven line deshadowing instability dominate the emission @xcite .",
    "since accelerated particles exist in many cwbs , the possibility of inverse compton x - ray emission has previously been raised by a number of authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "others have argued that non - thermal x - rays can be produced in the intrinsic wind shocks formed through the line - deshadowing instability @xcite .",
    "a recent review of non - thermal emission processes in massive binaries can be found in @xcite .",
    "however non - thermal x - rays might be produced , their detection requires that their flux become significant relative to the thermal x - ray flux .",
    "unfortunately , a campaign focused on o - stars with known non - thermal radio emission failed to unambiguously detect any non - thermal x - ray s at energies below 10kev @xcite . only from hd159176 was possible evidence of a non - thermal component found @xcite .",
    "as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : hd159176 ] , this system has a very short period .",
    "the stellar winds likely collide at relatively low speeds , which limits the hardness of the thermal x - ray emission , allowing easier detection of a possible non - thermal component .",
    "the chance of unambiguously detecting non - thermal x - ray s increases with energy , as the emission from the thermal component falls off .",
    "it is partly for this reason that non - thermal x - ray emission has been reported from a _ suzaku _ observation of @xmath93  car @xcite .",
    "however , it appears that , at least in the soft ( @xmath94kev ) domain , non - thermal x - rays are at best a relatively insignificant component",
    "this work investigates the x - ray emission from short - period o+o - star binaries where orbital effects and the acceleration of the winds are important .",
    "the structure and dynamics of the stellar winds and the wind - wind collision region for four distinct systems were previously calculated using a 3d hydrodynamical code ( paper  i ) .",
    "we explore the emission arising from these models , under conditions where the wcr is radiative ( model cwb1 ) or adiabatic ( model cwb2 ) , where the winds have unequal strengths ( model cwb3 ) , and where the orbit is eccentric ( model cwb4 ) .",
    "we find that model cwb1 shows the greatest x - ray variability of the three models with circular orbits ( models cwb1 , cwb2 and cwb3 ) , due to the closer stellar separation and the higher densities surrounding the wcr .",
    "the lightcurves from each of these models are asymmetrical because of orbit induced aberration and curvature of the wcr .",
    "the asymmetry is greatest for model cwb1 , which has the highest ratio of orbital to wind speeds , @xmath95 , of the 3 simulations .",
    "the lightcurve asymmetry is always greatest for an observer located in the orbital plane ( @xmath14 ) , and generally decreases with decreasing @xmath96 ( as does the level of variability ) .",
    "model cwb4 shows that the x - ray emission from systems with eccentric orbits can be spectacularly variable , and can display a strong hysteresis around the orbit . in general ,",
    "the emission is softer while the stars are separating after periastron passage , and harder when the stars are approaching .",
    "the degree of hysteresis , and its duration , likely depends on the amplitude of changes to the ratio of the orbital period to the flow time of the shocked plasma out of the system .",
    "as expected , the increase in the luminosity as periastron is approached does not follow the @xmath0 scaling of an adiabatic , terminal wind speeds , wcr .",
    "the observed change also depends on the energy band and the observer s orientation .",
    "the ratio of the ism corrected @xmath31kev x - ray luminosity to the system bolometric luminosity , @xmath35 , reaches values as high as @xmath97 under favourable viewing angles , consistent with a very strong colliding winds signature .",
    "all - in - all , the diversity and richness of the simulated x - ray lightcurves matches well their observational counterparts .",
    "we use the difference between the intrinsic and attenuated spectra from the models to calculate `` effective '' circumstellar absorbing columns which we demonstrate can be extremely energy dependent .",
    "therefore , simple spectral fits which assume energy independent columns are over - simplified in the same way that modelling the spectrum with only a handful of different plasma temperatures is , and risk compromising the subsequent interpretation .",
    "we also fold our theoretical spectra through the response files of the _ chandra _ and _ suzaku _ observatories , add poisson noise , and then analyze using the same method used for the analysis of real data . in many cases",
    "the fits return circumstellar columns in good agreement with the energy - dependent `` effective '' columns calculated directly from the theoretical spectra . however , there are also many instances where the returned columns have values which are not so close , and/or do not properly capture the trend of the effective circumstellar column with energy .",
    "we also find that despite our theoretical spectra being calculated with solar abundances , exclusively sub - solar values are returned by the spectral fitting package to our simulated spectra when the global abundance is allowed to fit freely .",
    "the global abundances become closer to the true ( solar ) value as the complexity of the spectral model increases .",
    "these issues highlight some of the problems associated with fitting overly simplified models to spectra , including non - uniqueness of the returned values , and of course are of wider significance than just cwbs .",
    "moreover , the intrinsic luminosities inferred from very short period systems are often underestimated ( by up to a factor of two ) , since the spectral models as used are unable to account for occultation losses . despite these failings , in many cases",
    "the resulting fit parameters are , at least to first order , similar to those obtained from the analysis of real observations .",
    "more stringent comparisons between theory and observations will require the modelling of specific systems , such as work currently being conducted on @xmath93car .    in this paper",
    "we have examined the emission from main - sequence o+o - star systems , in which circumstellar absorption is relatively minor .",
    "circumstellar absorption becomes more important as the stellar mass - loss rates increase , so that cwbs which contain a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star should display more significant orbital modulation of their lightcurves and spectra than seen in this work .",
    "for this reason , future work will explore the dynamics and emission from wr+o systems , where dynamical effects like radiative braking @xcite will also be important .",
    "it will also be interesting to explore other parts of the cwb parameter space .",
    "this could include : i ) systems where a weaker wind is completely overwhelmed by a stronger wind ( relevant to hd93205 , amongst others ) , ii ) systems with an eccentric orbit where all ( or one side ) of the shocked plasma in the wcr is radiative throughout the entire orbit ( relevant to systems like hd155248 , an o7.5(f)iii+o7(f)iii binary with a 5.816d orbit of eccentricity 0.127 @xcite , which shows strong phase - locked x - ray emission with an asymmetric modulation @xcite ) , iii ) systems with more than two stars ( relevant to hd167971 and qzcar , amongst others ) .",
    "this work has also been limited to simulating medium resolution x - ray spectra .",
    "future work will examine x - ray line profiles , which can directly probe the dynamics deep in the wcr @xcite , and interesting physics such as non - equilibrium ionization ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and non - equilibrium electron and ion temperatures @xcite .",
    "further papers will examine the high energy non - thermal emission at x - ray and @xmath1-ray energies up to the tev range .    despite this long to - do list ,",
    "the present work has provided further essential groundwork , highlighting the factors which affect various aspects of the x - ray emission from short period o+o star binaries .",
    "it lays the foundations for a better understanding of some of the key physics of such systems ( e.g. radiatively driven winds , high mach number shocks ) , which will be studied with future models of particular systems .",
