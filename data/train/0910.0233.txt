    "the authors of ref.@xcite found that the total current is not the vector sum of josephson and the transport currents because of a new term in the current .",
    "this term is called the `` interference '' current and can be a `` parallel josephson current '' . in the ref.@xcite , effect of reflection at the interface between @xmath15wave superconductors has been investigated analytically and numerically .    in this paper ,",
    "a planar weak link between two @xmath0-wave superconductors with a phase difference between order parameters is investigated .",

    "we create an ideal transparent thin slit with length @xmath17 and width @xmath18 .",
    "interference between wave functions of the left and right superconductors occurs through the slit .",
    "the remainder part of interface is an ideal insulator and is impenetrable for cooper pairs . also , two transport supercurrents at the @xmath1-planes are flowing parallel to the insulator and the contact plane ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the josephson current from one of the bulks to another , is a result of the interference between states with phase difference @xmath19 as is predicted in ref.@xcite",
    ". the contact scales ( thin slit ) , length @xmath17 and width @xmath18 , are much larger than the fermi wavelength and smaller than coherence length of superconductivity .",
    "furthermore , these scales are small as compared with the mean free path of quasi - particles .",
    "therefore the quasi - classical approximation for the ballistic point contact can be used .",
    "the eilenberger equations for this system are solved and green functions are obtained .",
    "the effects of mis - orientation and phase difference between order parameters and super - fluid velocity on the current distributions and current - phase graphs are investigated in this paper .",
    "the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows . in sec.[2 ] the quasiclassical equations for green functions are presented .",
    "the obtained formulas for the green functions are used to analyze a current state in the ballistic point contact .",
    "also the effects of transport current and mis - orientation on the current distribution at the contact plane are investigated . in sec.[3 ]",
    "the results of simulation for current distribution in vicinity of the contact will be investigated .",
    "an analytical investigation of system near the critical temperature will be done in sec.[4 ] .",
    "the paper will be finished with some conclusions in sec.[5 ] .",
    "the eilenberger equations for the @xmath20-integrated green s functions are used to describe the coherent current states in a superconducting ballistic micro - structures @xcite :    @xmath21=0\\label{eilenberger}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 @xmath23 is the superconducting order parameter , @xmath24 is the pauli matrix , and @xmath25 is the matrix green function which depends on the electron velocity on the fermi surface @xmath26 , the coordinate @xmath27 and matsubara frequency @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 being an integer number and temperature respectively . also the normalization condition @xmath31 with @xmath32 being time - reversal counterpart of @xmath33 should be satisfied by solutions of the eilenberger equations .",
    "in general , @xmath34 depends on the direction of @xmath35 and @xmath27 and it can be determined by the self - consistent equation @xmath36 and the current density by @xmath37 respectively , where @xmath38 is the interaction potential , @xmath39 is the 2d density of states at the fermi surface for each spin projection and @xmath40 is the averaging over directions of @xmath26 .",
    "solution of the matrix equation ( [ eilenberger ] ) together with self - consistency gap equation ( [ self consistent ] ) , maxwell equation for superfluid velocity and normalization condition determines the current @xmath41 in the system . the thickness of @xmath0-wave superconductors are assumed to be smaller than coherence length @xmath42 .",
    "thus the spatial distributions of @xmath43 and @xmath44 depend only on the coordinates in the plane of the film and eilenberger equations ( [ eilenberger ] ) reduce to 2d equations",
    ". + also equations ( [ eilenberger ] ) for green functions @xmath45 have to be supplemented by the condition of specular reflection at the region @xmath46 and continuity of solutions across the point contact @xmath47 .",
    "far from the contact the green functions should be coincident with the bulk solutions and the current should be homogeneous transport current along the @xmath48-axis .",
    "+ in this formalism , the current has to be determined by a self - consistent gap equation ( [ self consistent ] ) together with the maxwell equation for superfluid velocity ( ampere law @xmath49 with @xmath50 for free space and @xmath51 for superfluid velocity as in paper @xcite ) . while for simplicity",
    ", the self - consistency of order parameter is ignored and a step function is considered for spatial dependence and we do not consider effect of current distribution on the superfluid velocity .",
    "we believe that as in the papers @xcite , the self - consistent investigation of d - wave josephson junction does not show a qualitative different from the non - self - consistent results . + for @xmath52 and @xmath53 being constants at each half plane an analytical solution for eilenberger equations can be found by the method of integration along the quasi - classical trajectories of quasi - particles . in any point , @xmath54",
    ", all ballistic trajectories can be categorized as transit and non - transit trajectories .",
    "+ for the transit trajectories the green functions satisfy continuity at the contact and the non - transit trajectories satisfy the specular reflection condition at the partition , @xmath55 . also , all transit and non - transit trajectories should satisfy the boundary conditions in the left and right bulks . making use of solutions of the eilenberger equations ,",
    "the following expression is obtained for current at the slit : @xmath56 where , @xmath57 for @xmath58 symmetry @xmath59 , @xmath60 with @xmath61 being matsubara frequency and @xmath53 is super - fluid velocity , @xmath62 is the unit vector , @xmath63 . in this non - stationary josephson junction , @xmath64 ,",
    "the current has both @xmath65 and @xmath66 components .",
    "we define the josephson current , external transport current , spontaneous current and interference current as : @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 respectively .",
    "the josephson current , @xmath71 , is normal to the interface between superconductors as was considered by b. d. josephson in @xcite and parallel component of current @xmath72 consists of three terms of current , an external transport current , spontaneous current and `` interference '' current .",
    "the new current term , `` interference '' current , depends on the super - fluid velocity , orientations with respect to the interface and phase difference between order parameters .",
    "this term of current , @xmath73 , is completely different from the transport current on the banks @xmath74 .",
    "+ thus in addition to the spontaneous current for the stationary @xmath0-wave josephson junction that is investigated in ref.@xcite and transport current , we observe another current parallel to the interface ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "in particular , at @xmath14 it may go into the opposite direction to the external transport current on the banks ( depending on the orientations ) .",
    "this sign reversal of tangential supercurrent which is origin of vortex - like currents near the orifice has been observed already in ref.@xcite for the case of @xmath8wave junction . at two sides of vortex - like currents , currents are flowing parallel and antiparallel to the external supercurrent at the superconducting banks . in the ref.@xcite",
    "a superconductor - normal - superconductor trajectory for particles has been considered while there is one superconductor coupled the normal metal .",
    "so , because of one superconductor in the structure of ref.@xcite it was impossible to consider the phase difference . in the case of junction between @xmath15wave superconductors in ref.@xcite , it was observed that sign reversal can be seen only for @xmath14 .",
    "so , for @xmath15wave counterpart of setup of paper @xcite it is impossible to see the sign reversal because phase difference @xmath19 does not meaning for system including one superconductor .",
    "while in our calculations in this paper we have observed that , this sign reversal and vortex appearance can be seen at @xmath6 , depending on mis - orientation . for the case of @xmath8wave in paper of @xcite in the absence of phase difference , a sign reversal of current has been observed as well as our results for suitable mis - orientation of @xmath76planes(@xmath77 or planes ( 1,0,0),(1,1,0 ) ) .",
    "the planes @xmath78 and @xmath79 are corresponding to planes @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "the effects of mis - orientation and super - fluid velocity on the current - phase relation and current distribution are investigated numerically and the results are following .",
    "+ 1 ) the vortex - like currents appear at values of @xmath19 when the parallel current is maximum and positive while the external transport current is negative ( figs.[fig2],[fig5],[fig4 ] and [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "+ 2 ) at @xmath82 and arbitrary @xmath19 , the current distributions and current - phase graphs are identical with the @xmath5-wave which is investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "for example at @xmath82 and @xmath83 two anti - symmetric vortex - like currents are observed and their common axis is normal to the interface ( fig.[fig7 ] ) .",
    "+ 3 ) at @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath83 , two vortex - like currents are observed .",
    "their common axis is rotated as much as @xmath86 ( fig.[fig6 ] and fig.[fig8 ] ) .",
    "this case occurs for @xmath84 , @xmath83 and arbitrary @xmath87 with the rotated axis rotating as much as @xmath88 .",
    "+ 4 ) the appearance of vortex - like currents can be controlled by mis - orientation .",
    "for example , at @xmath6 and @xmath82 , we can not observe the vortex - like currents as we can not observe in @xmath5-wave junction ( fig.[fig9 ] ) .",
    "however , for @xmath6 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 the vortex - like currents appear since from ( [ current2 ] ) and for @xmath91 symmetry we have : @xmath92 5 ) in figs.[fig5],[fig4],[fig3 ] it is observed that for @xmath6 and consequently without any external magnetic flux , the interference between coherent current - states can occur and the vortex - like currents can be observed because mis - orientation plays the role of the phase difference in eq.([symmetry ] ) .",
    "+ 6 ) the parallel current , @xmath93 , is plotted in terms of the phase difference for different super - fluid velocities and at @xmath82 , the maximum value of current and appearance of vortex - like currents occur at @xmath83 . in this case , far from @xmath83 , we observe a constant current that is the external transport current on the banks ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "+ 7 ) for @xmath89 , @xmath94 the maximum values of the parallel current , @xmath93 , and consequently the vortices appear at @xmath6 , @xmath83 , @xmath95 ( figs.[fig4],[fig3 ] ) .",
    "+ 8) for @xmath89 , @xmath90 the current - phase graphs are similar to the @xmath82 but a displacement as much as @xmath3 occurs ( figs.[fig2],[fig5 ] ) .",
    "thus the vortices can be observed at @xmath6 and @xmath95 .",
    "but at @xmath83 , we do not observe the vortex - like currents .",
    "this can be another difference between conventional and unconventional josephson junctions .",
    "+ 9 ) the superposition of dash lines in figs.[fig4],[fig3 ] for zero super - fluid velocity , and all the lines of fig.[fig2 ] , for zero mis - orientations gives us the three lines of figs.[fig4],[fig3 ] apparently .",
    "this means that in this case the tangential current is algebraic sum of transport current , `` interference '' current@xcite and spontaneous current @xcite .",
    "+ 10 ) the tangential current for @xmath82 and @xmath96 is an even function of josephson phase @xmath19 but for @xmath97 it is neither even nor odd function of phase difference @xmath19 and the symmetry will be broken .",
    "+ the superfluid of pairs creates the transport current but the spontaneous current is produced by mis - orientation plus to the phase difference .",
    "however the `` interference '' current depends on all of the parameters ( phase difference , mis - orientation and superfluid velocity ) and it can be the result of the non - locality of supercurrent . + the spatial distributions of the order parameter and the current near and precisely at the contact are calculated using the green function along the transit and non - transit trajectories numerically .",
    "transit trajectories for each point are coming from the orifice ( transparent part of interface @xmath98 ) while non - transit trajectories form the remainder part of interface which is impenetrable ( reflective part of interface @xmath99 ) .",
    "the current distributions are calculated and simulated numerically for @xmath100 , @xmath101 and different choices of mis - orientation for @xmath83 ( figs.[fig6],[fig7],[fig8 ] ) and @xmath6 ( fig.[fig9 ] ) .",
    "following the ref.@xcite , the `` interference '' current that plays a central role for production of vortex - like current is found . at the phase values @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath82 , the interference current is very small thus the total current is close to the vector sum of transport , spontaneous and josephson currents .",
    "but , for @xmath104 the `` interference '' current appears and the total current deviates from the vector sum of the three old currents @xcite .",
    "also , for zero mis - orientation the spontaneous current is zero .",
    "+ the `` interference '' current is always anti - parallel to the transport current . but the spontaneous current may be parallel or anti - parallel to the transport current . if algebraic sum of transport , `` interference '' and spontaneous current is anti - parallel to the transport current on the banks , we can find the vortex - like currents ( fig.[fig7 ] ) . +",
    "thus the appearance of the vortex - like currents can be controlled by mis - orientation and phase difference .",
    "it is remarkable that , far from the contact @xmath105 for all @xmath19s , mis - orientations , temperatures @xmath30 and superfluid velocities , the distributions of currents tend to the tangential transport currents on the banks . +",
    "for temperatures close to the critical temperature , @xmath106 problem is solvable pure analytically @xcite . at the contact we have @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 where , as in ref.@xcite @xmath112 is a critical current of the contact at @xmath113 ,",
    "@xmath114 is a standard notation @xmath115 for the high value of temperatures near the @xmath9 , the critical values of currents have a linear dependence on the @xmath116 , which can be replaced by @xmath117 on the other hand the spontaneous and josephson currents are sinusoidal function of phase difference as is expected for the currents near the @xmath9 , in spite of these two terms of current the `` interference '' current is an even function of the phase difference .",
    "the current is divided into the four parts , josephson current @xmath118 , spontaneous current , transport current in the banks @xmath74 and the `` interference '' current @xmath73 .",
    "it is observed that , the currents generally and near the @xmath9 obviously , depend not only on the mis - orientation @xmath119 but also depend on the orientations with respect to the interface .",
    "because in the expressions @xmath120 , the result of angular integrations may include both @xmath119 and @xmath121 terms .",
    "for example , for josephson and spontaneous currents in ( [ josephtc ] ) and ( [ sponttc ] ) by angular integration on the fermi surface we have @xmath122\\widehat{{\\bf x}}\\label{integrated1}\\ ] ] and for spontaneous current @xmath123 respectively . also it is obtained that for @xmath83 and exactly at the contact , the `` interference '' current @xmath75 is anti - parallel to the @xmath74 . for @xmath83 the `` interference '' , josephson and spontaneous currents are @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 respectively , consequently it is obtained that @xmath127 in this case while the josephson current is zero the terms @xmath66 and @xmath74 that are directed opposite to the each other , control the appearance of vortex - like currents in vicinity of the point contact .",
    "in addition , for @xmath6 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we can observe the vortex - like currents .",
    "this property can be a difference between @xmath0-wave and @xmath5-wave josephson junctions . because in the @xmath5-wave josephson junction the vortex - like currents are observed only for @xmath83 ( ref.@xcite ) , while in the present calculations for @xmath0-wave josephson junction",
    ", the vortex - like currents may appear even for @xmath6 .",
    "thus , for fixed values of the temperature and superfluid velocity , the presence of vortex - like currents can be controlled by mis - orientation and phase difference .",
    "the vortex - like currents in vicinity of the point contact are observed for @xmath0-wave josephson junction as well as for @xmath5-wave junction in ref.@xcite .",
    "the interference current as a result of non - local supercurrent states , appears .",
    "it may flow opposite to the external transport current .",
    "for @xmath83 , @xmath78 and @xmath128 the vortex - like currents with the rotated axis are observed . but as is obtained in ref.@xcite , the axis of vortex - like currents in the @xmath5-wave josephson junction is normal to the interface .",
    "thus , this rotated axis can be used to distinguish between @xmath5-wave and @xmath0-wave junction .",
    "also it can be exerted to distinguish between the junction between two pure @xmath5-wave and mixing of conventional and unconventional order parameters ( eg.@xmath129 ) .",
    "in addition to the zes , this rotated axis can be another `` fingerprint '' of @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry .",
    "another interesting result is , the behavior of system in the absence of the phase difference . for @xmath5-wave system only in the presence of the phase difference , @xmath130 ,",
    "the vortex - like currents appear @xcite , while for @xmath0-wave josephson junction at zero phase and zero external magnetic flux , it is possible to observe the vortex - like currents for some mis - orientations .",
    "this can be a theoretical reason that , the mis - orientation plays role instead of the phase difference ( josephson phase ) . in the stationary josephson junction @xmath131 the tangential interference current ( spontaneous current ) will be observed only for @xmath132 but in the opposite case @xmath133 the tangential current even in the absence of phase difference may be observed .",
    "in addition , this tangential current can flow in the opposite direction to the external transport current and this factor can produce the vortex - like currents . finally , playing the role of magnetic josephson phase ( @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are electric charge and magnetic flux respectively ) by mis - orientation of superconducting @xmath1-planes ( pairing symmetry in the momentum space ) is a reason for magnetic nature of pairing mechanism in the high @xmath9 superconductors which remains as an unknown and famous problem .",

    "<S> the current distribution of this junction between @xmath0-wave superconductors is totally different from the junction between @xmath5-wave superconductors . as the interesting results , spontaneous and josephson currents </S>",
    "<S> are observed for the case of @xmath6 . </S>"
