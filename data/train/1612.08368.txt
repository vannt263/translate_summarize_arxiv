    "previous works have shown that it is not possible to reconstruct the genealogical history of each species along all its generations through a geometric progression @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the geometric progression is determined by a sequence of independent events . from the model point of view",
    ", we postulated that blood relationship between ancestors ( or inbreeding ) is the key to connect the consecutive generations .",
    "it is well known that close inbreeding within species can result in inbreeding depression caused by an increased homozygosity of recessive , deleterious alleles and loss of heterosis @xcite . however",
    ", extreme intraspecific outbreeding can also be disadvantageous ( outbreeding depression ) @xcite , because beneficial gene complexes or local genetic adaptations are disrupted @xcite .",
    "there is numerous empirical support that animals avoid close kin as mating partner @xcite .",
    "optimal outbreeding theory @xcite is supported by experimental behavioral studies showing mating preferences for intermediately related individuals @xcite and by genetic studies reporting stabilizing selection on genomic divergence in wild populations of animals @xcite and plants @xcite .",
    "empirical studies of inbreeding strategy have reported inbreeding tolerance in different species such as new zealand robins , _ petroica australis _",
    "@xcite ; bighorn sheep ( _ ovis canadensis _ ) @xcite ; great tits ( _ parus major _ ) @xcite and even inbreeding preference in cichlid fish ( _ pelvicachromis taeniatus _ ) @xcite .",
    "recent studies have also found evidence of regular incest in wild mammals , even in social species where relatives are spatio - temporally clustered and opportunities for inbreeding frequently arise @xcite .    considering some degree of incest along biparental species as a key to build a general model and using a markov process it is possible to obtain a more realistic model for a tree of ancestors @xcite . if we consider a random variable that represents the number of ancestors present in a given generation , the size of the sample space depends on each generation .",
    "this brings huge problems to find an analytical solution .    in @xcite",
    "we proposed a method to solve this problem .",
    "now we present here an alternative way to obtain an estimation of the mean value of the ancestors number for each generation following the same time - line approach that @xcite , meaning starting from the present and tracking back the possible sequence of ancestors , but now using a simple computational model to follow back the chain of ancestors .",
    "our first model implemented consisted in a simple algorithm that we will describe in the following sections . before starting the description , there are two important assumptions about the biology of the considered system . initially the species described here has no specific behavior of sexual partner selection ( random mating reproduction ) @xcite .",
    "this means that in our model the partner could be a kin or not .",
    "many species or population groups exhibit this kind of reproduction .",
    "this is the most simple case to perform the calculation .",
    "the second assumption is about the population size .",
    "the distribution of ancestors for a given generation is contained in a population large enough to not force the selection of blood - related sexual partners .",
    "the partners could be blood related or not , randomly up to a maximum generation when the process start to decrease .",
    "current model presents a random mating in non - overlapping generations with negligible mutation and selection .",
    "these two assumptions are common to develop population genetic models ; in particular , these are present in the hardy - weinberg principle @xcite .",
    "we present a description of the problem through an algorithmic and analytic approach .",
    "the structure of this manuscript is developed as follows : section [ build ] is a description of the algorithm implemented to generate the trees of ancestors .",
    "section [ rebuild ] shows an equivalent description and a generalization in terms of mathematical symbols .",
    "a comparative results between the implemented algorithm and the theoretical model @xcite are presented in section [ compare ] . finally in section",
    "v we present conclusions and further work .",
    "we started creating a simplified tree of ancestors for one individual in the following way . in this work we considered an index @xmath0 that labeled the generation number , starting from @xmath1 the _ parents _ generation , @xmath2 the _ grandparents _ generation and so forth . at the beginning of all we fix the number of ancestors for the first generation , @xmath1 , at @xmath3 , because the individuals have sexual reproduction .",
    "in sucessive generations @xmath4 we run a random number generator , denoted by @xmath5 , to obtain a number between @xmath3 and a maximum value that will depend on generation number . in each generation",
    "the maximum possible ancestors number is : @xmath6    to avoid a high endogamy degree at the beginning of the tree , we also fix this value at generation @xmath2 at @xmath7 . therefore in the next generation , @xmath8 ,",
    "the maximum possible ancestor number is @xmath9 . now at @xmath8 for the first time we run a random generator with a uniform distribution to obtain a number between 2 and @xmath10 .",
    "the possible maximum number for ancestors in the following generation , @xmath11 is less than or equal to @xmath12 .",
    "actually this value depends on the random value obtained in the generation before .    in general , for one individual at the generation @xmath0",
    "is not possible to have more ancestors that the double of the ancestors obtained in @xmath13 ( two parents per each predecessor ) , i.e : @xmath14 and of course we have @xmath15 , for all @xmath0 .",
    "the expression is a _",
    "better _ upper bound that @xmath15 , because @xmath16 .    to illustrate a set of possible trees ,",
    "the figure [ fig:01 ] shows three simple examples for the first generations in the chain .",
    "generations ) to illustrate the different possible inbreeding cases .",
    "@xmath17 no restrictions by blood relationship .",
    "@xmath18 two kinds of restriction in third generation : ancestors sharing one parent @xmath19 and ancestors sharing two parents @xmath20 .",
    "the restriction by blood relationship increases according to the degree of endogamy @xcite . ]    for each @xmath21generation in the tree , we obtained a random number @xmath5 between the limits given for the random number obtained in the previous generation , i.e. @xmath22 $ ] , which represents the possibility of blood relationship , or endogamy , between the individuals of the same generation .",
    "a full tree is developed via a generation number loop increasing program . in order to avoid any possible bias in the tree we change the seed of the random generator in each run .",
    "additionally we establish a given generation in which the ancestors number is maximum ( more detail presented in section [ parameters - sec ] ) .",
    "the length of the genealogical tree is as long as we want to define , for instance in our illustrative example we use @xmath23 generations at most , depending on when the random generator obtain a minimum of @xmath3 ancestors .",
    "nevertheless an important consideration is that the simulation of one particular tree could end early , if for a given generation the number of ancestors reaches by chance the number 2 .",
    "four examples of random trees generated are shown in figure [ fig:02 ] , where @xmath24 in corresponds to the case in which all ancestors are different in each @xmath21generation .",
    "nevertheless with this first approach presented sometimes we obtained very endogamous trees .",
    "the reason for this was that any possible combination of inbreeding between ancestors has the same probability ( uniform distribution ) and becomes very unlikely a non - inbreeding case , therefore we need to introduce additional considerations over the endogamy degree . therefore we improve the algorithm in order to provide a more realistic simulation .",
    "we found a way to have more control of the endogamy degree of the tree .",
    "we enrich the algorithm by endowing it with the possibility of switch the reproduction between inbreeding or not .",
    "we used a second random number generator in each generation @xmath0 , namely @xmath25 , that returns an integer @xmath26 nor @xmath27 .",
    "the outcome of @xmath25 and @xmath5 can affect to @xmath28 stochastically .",
    "one of the leading actors in this algorithm is the distribution used for the random generator number @xmath28 , taking to account the previous result for @xmath5 and the branch from which it comes .",
    "analytically this is equivalent to a conditional probability for @xmath28 given @xmath5 and @xmath25 : @xmath29 . a schematic diagram of the above description is shown in figure [ diag1 ] .        on the other hand , in this work we considered equal probabilities for each branch , i.e. @xmath26 or @xmath27 : @xmath30 .",
    "then of course , we have @xmath31 chances to obtain @xmath26 , also the same chances also for @xmath27 , for each @xmath0 .",
    "different reproductive behavior such as one male mating with several females in a group , could be changed via the percent rate in this second generator , or for instance other behavior like sibling selection could be included via the probability distribution of animal preferences using another distribution of probability different of the uniform , to give different weights within the inbreeding selection option , between @xmath3 and @xmath32 .",
    "we explore different distributions of random numbers for the development of each individual tree , but we selected those that could be linked experimentally with an animal reproductive behavior . in this case",
    "we study a uniform distribution and a negative exponential distribution for the growing of the tree and a negative exponential distribution for the decay of the tree .",
    "these and other more details will be exposed in the following section .      due to the freedom in the algorithm design as well as in its parameters , it is necessary to specify the information that lead to one possible development of the tree . taking to account the experimental data ,",
    "most of our assumptions could be replace by constraints of nature .",
    "we want the reader to be able to use the algorithm , i.e. choose the parameters and the probability distribution , in a way that would be useful to represent real data sets . here in this section",
    "we present our selection of parameters .",
    "each simulated tree has a maximum length of @xmath33 generations , but of course a given execution may finish before , as we explain in section [ sub - sec-1 ] .",
    "the simulation process is mainly separated into two regimens : _ growth _ and _ decay _ ; where the ancestors number increases and decreases , on average , respectively .",
    "as we explained above in section [ sub - sec-1 ] we chose a generation to be the one where the number of ancestors is maximum .",
    "we do not chose the maximum number of ancestors , we only chose where this maximum is reached , denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "after this generation the number of ancestor could never exceed the random value obtained for @xmath35generation .",
    "this generation define the _ growth interval _ : @xmath36 $ ] . in this paper we used @xmath37 .",
    "the _ decay interval _ is defined from @xmath34 to @xmath33 .",
    "both parts of the tree development , _ growth _ and _ decay _ , are ruled almost by the same algorithm rule : using a second random number generator @xmath38 to make a bifurcation in the algorithm .",
    "all these bifurcations leads to different actions depending on the regime we are dealing with , i.e. growth or decay .",
    "for the _ growth _ regime , remember the interval @xmath36 $ ] , if @xmath26 the ancestor s number at generation @xmath39 will be the maximum possible with no inbreeding : @xmath40 .",
    "this means that each ancestor in the generation @xmath0 has all different parents in the generation @xmath39 , i.e. the pairs of parents of each individual of generation @xmath39 are different one to one . if @xmath27 we well have for @xmath28 any kind of inbreeding reflected between @xmath3 and @xmath32 ,",
    "for this branch we use a uniform or a negative exponential distribution for the random number @xmath28 .",
    "the _ decay _ regime is subdivided in two parts , the first one is defined up to a cut generation @xmath41 . in this interval , @xmath42 $ ] , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 branches are equally the same as in the growth regime , the only difference here is that we only use a negative exponential distribution for the random number @xmath28 .",
    "the second one is a more _ harder decay _ version of the first part . in the interval",
    "@xmath43 $ ] we replace the not endogamy rule , in the @xmath26 branch , for a full - endogamy rule .",
    "we define full - endogamy as the case where the number of ancestors is fixed and constraint to the number of individuals at the beginning of the ancestors tree . in an extreme case ,",
    "the minimal number of individuals prefixed wold be 2 or 4 , but could be any number .",
    "this pre - fixed number represents the upper bound of the initial number of individuals at the beginning of the population who originated the tree . in other words ,",
    "we merge random endogamy probability with the probability of having a low fix number of ancestors ; that , again , represent the upper bound of individuals at the beginning of an initial population . the @xmath27 branch remains the same , only use a negative exponential distribution for the random number @xmath28 .",
    "for this reason , we call the first part as _ soft decay _ and the second part as _ hard decay_.    the @xmath27 branch is equally the same as in the firs    in the figures presented here , the @xmath41 is selected 10 generations before @xmath33 .",
    "even when some trees could end by chance before this generation , we used this rule to conduce any surviving tree to converge to the maximum possible value of individual who originated the tree , at @xmath44generation could be 2 , 4 or any other value .",
    "the number of ancestors at the end of tree is constrained to the number of individuals who originated a particular population .    to summarize the development of ancestor s tree",
    "could be split in three steps delimited by this four generations ordered as follows : @xmath45 .",
    "the _ growth _",
    "region starting from generation @xmath46 to @xmath34 and for the _ decay _ region consisting in two intervals : _ soft decay _ from @xmath34 to @xmath41 and _ hard decay _ from @xmath41 to @xmath33 .",
    "as we said before , we could add on the simulation a condition to request that not all possible inbreeding options be equally likely . to do that we used a different distribution in the growth representing differences in animal mate preferences .",
    "we compared a simulation using the uniform distribution , i.e. no preference in mate selection , with a simulation using the negative exponential distribution ( siblings preference ) . in the case of the second option",
    ", there is an additional free parameter in the distribution that allow us to control the endogamy degree .",
    "the exponential decay case corresponds to a very inbred preference of the ancestors ( close kin ) , where an increasing exponential distribution corresponds to avoid the incest as long as possible ( within the random case ) .",
    "the opposite case is an increasing exponential distributions , it corresponds to a preference selection of a not close kin when selecting a kin for mate .",
    "we chose a _",
    "shift _ in the negative exponential distribution , that depends on the generation .",
    "this shift was chosen in order to obtain the maximum endogamous probability at the half of the interval between @xmath3 and @xmath47 for each generation @xmath0 . in the decay part",
    ", our selection was always using the exponential decay distribution , since we want to give in the decay more weight to the endogamous preference .",
    "other additional distribution could be used , such a gaussian distribution . in this case",
    "there is an additional parameter to fix , that not necessary represent an aspect in animal mate selection .",
    "we did not use such distribution because we want that all parameters represent some aspect on the animal mate preference .  but even so , the gaussian distribution could be use in other similar simulations based on the ancestors simulation algorithm to represent some other markovian process .    in section [ rebuild ]",
    "we show a way to describe the simulation as a theoretical stochastic process , that allows to describe the expected value of @xmath28 given the values of @xmath48 , as a recurrence equation , using the _ law of total probability_. the expected value for @xmath28 depends on two terms corresponding to the cases @xmath26 nor @xmath27 .",
    "once we generated the tree for one individual , we studied what happens with a general population with independent ancestors trees generated as explain in section [ parameters - sec ] .",
    "the process consist in generate the reproductive history of each individual for a certain number of generations ( to create a set of individual random trees ) and then take the average of the total population , generation by generation . in that way we have a representative mean behavior of the trees population for each generation .",
    "the average of the generated trees samples could be compared with the expected value of the random variable in the first theoretical model @xcite .",
    "our first trial was made considering a population of 50 individuals each one with its own tree , to have an animal population large enough but a fast simulation in order to study different effect on the selection of model parameters , i.e. we averaged each generation of the independent 50 trees .",
    "there are other ways to combine the trees without using the mean of the sample set , for instance by means of a genetic algorithm @xcite .",
    "but the arbitrary choice of a parameter over others to optimize the trees ( fitness ) and use them as seeds to generate new trees prevent us to follow this approach .",
    "additional studies with data from the biology field are necessary to follow the genetic algorithm approach .",
    "comments on the proposed model from biologists are specially welcome to enlighten us to follow this possible path .      in order to perform the simulation we used different distributions for the random number generator as described in section [ parameters - sec ] .",
    "the most simple case consist in taking the uniform distribution .",
    "the results obtained with uniform distribution are presented in figure [ fig:03 ] ( right ) .",
    "the uncertainties in all figures are the bin errors associated with each @xmath49 , the data of the @xmath50 in the @xmath51bin .",
    "this quantity are calculate as the standard error on the mean as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the standard deviation @xmath54 of the @xmath49 data and @xmath55 is the number of bin entries , in this case the number of trees that are considered in the calculation of the mean at the @xmath51bin .",
    "different selection for the generation where the ancestors number start to decrease and a maximum generation to end the process , @xmath33 , previously described in [ parameters - sec ] are shown in figure [ fig:03 ] . in each case , the mean ancestors number grows , reaches a maximum value and then decrease , depending on the maximum generation to end the process .",
    "figures shows process ending up to generation @xmath56 , increasing this value up to @xmath57 .",
    "when we change the maximum generation , the evolution of the mean value is affected as it is shown in figure [ fig:03 ] .",
    "other possible setting for the tree of ancestors is not to finish the process when the number of ancestors is two and end it with a different number of ancestors as initial population as we said in section [ parameters - sec ] .",
    "this case corresponds to a particular population starting not with 2 original ancestors , but with other number of couples of animals .",
    "for instance 200 original individuals as the initial population .",
    "this case is shown in figure [ fig:04 ] .",
    "this is a parameter that can be change in order to compare with a known animal population under study .",
    "we used a negative exponential distribution , with the same constraints representing a preference for the animals to chose close kins and compare it with the uniform case .",
    "we expected to obtain smaller values for the ancestors number in this case .",
    "a comparison between the case using the uniform distribution and the exponential decade distribution are shown in figure [ fig:04 ] , where the average of 50 trees generated with each one are shown with dots and squares . as we expected smaller values for the ancestors",
    "number are obtain when using the exponential distribution for the same values of initial population and maximum generation .",
    "the figure [ fig:04 ] ( top ) corresponds to the case where the initial ancestors number is different to 2 , using the uniform distribution .",
    "the figure [ fig:04 ] ( bottom ) corresponds to the comparison between the uniform distribution and the negative exponential distribution .     +     in terms of the simulation , the code execution collects a certain number of realizations , i.e. a number of generated trees @xmath58 . in @xmath21generation",
    "we compute the number of trees , coming from executions of the code , that have not finished in that generation , whose result for @xmath5 is _ equal to _ @xmath59 , denoted by @xmath60 , divided by the total number of trees , coming from executions that have not finished in that generation also , denoted by @xmath61 .",
    "this quotient could works as a pdf of @xmath5 @xmath62\\;\\mathlarger{\\thicksim}\\;\\frac{t(n|r)}{t(n)},\\ ] ] the symbol @xmath63 represent a correspondence satisfied more properly conform @xmath58 grows , i.e. a large number of code executions .",
    "each generated tree is a certain histogram , distributed in mutually exclusive cases , @xmath64 , then the quotient on the right side of will be normalized properly @xmath65    if we have from the simulation a quantity _ almost _ equal to the prior distribution , we can obtain the expected value , or even more , the higher @xmath66order moments for each generation @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath67 , associated to the distribution using the definition provided by the theory of probability @xmath68    with this simple simulation we built individual trees and ensembles of trees for animals , in order to use them to show characteristics of the process . in the simulation we represented the animal preference for mate by a set of free parameter of the proposed algorithmic model .",
    "the examples presented are not intended to be exhaustive , just to give an idea on the consequence of parameter selection .",
    "this preference could be taken from experimental data , with a different number of individuals of the population under study or different group of original ancestors .",
    "further models could include other characteristics of particular animal groups , even a different way to generate the ensemble of trees .",
    "another variable to consider is the time that takes to create a full tree .",
    "it depends on the length of the tree , longer trees needs more computational time .",
    "simulations up to 100 generations when we generate @xmath69 tree takes much more than 4 hours .",
    "the current code implementation is linear with the generation number .",
    "it could be improved in the future using parallel programming tools @xcite .",
    "the model of the tree described here was implemented in c++ using root libraries @xcite .",
    "this object oriented framework also was used to analyze the results of the simulation .",
    "all tools used in present work correspond to open source packages .",
    "in this section we describe the simulation analytically , such as a theoretical stochastic process",
    ". we will give the tools to the reader in order to describe the algorithm analytically .",
    "with them we can describe not only these types of trees , but also we can generalize the process , in order to study this and other problems analytically .    for the kind of trees described in section [ sofisti ]",
    ", we consider the stochastic process of two random variables @xmath70 on _ discrete time _",
    "as we said , the random variable @xmath5 represents the ancestor number at generation @xmath0 an the role of the random variable @xmath25 will be to define paths for the values that can take @xmath28 , given the acquired value at previous generation , @xmath5 . in section [ sub - sec-1 ] we have seen that for @xmath27 case the sample space of @xmath5 , @xmath71 , is delimited by the obtained value for @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73\\}$ ] . as a general rule , we _ throw _ a random number , @xmath25 , at generation @xmath0 between two possibilities , for instance @xmath74 . according to the result of @xmath25 , we choose one of the following two branches , where @xmath75 is the set of values for @xmath28 given @xmath76 and @xmath5 also .",
    "the transition behavior of the process is governed , essentially , though the conditional probability @xmath77 as we see in figure [ diag1 ] . in this paper",
