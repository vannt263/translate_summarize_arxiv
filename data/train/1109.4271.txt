    "the original idea that heavy quarkonia might be suppressed in a deconfined qcd medium , thereby probing the formation of a quark - gluon plasma in high - energy nuclear collisions  @xcite , has motivated many studies ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the properties of quarkonia in a medium  be it deconfined or hadronic , as it was realized that the most fragile states might already be destroyed in a hot hadron gas  have been extensively investigated , both in lattice qcd calculations and using effective field - theoretical approaches  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was understood that a description of heavy quarkonia in a medium as non - relativistic quark - antiquark systems bound by an effective static potential is possible , provided the potential has an imaginary part  @xcite , which accounts for the finite lifetime of the states .",
    "this emphasizes the necessity to consider the real - time dynamics of quarkonia , which becomes even more pregnant when the medium is rapidly expanding and cooling down , as is the case of the fireball in nucleus  nucleus collisions .    for that purpose , it is interesting to consider alternative modelings of the influence of the medium on the embedded @xmath0 pair .",
    "noting that the latter is a `` small system '' , then the surrounding medium can be seen as a `` reservoir '' , which can exchange energy and momentum with the small system without being noticeably affected .",
    "this is analogous to the paradigm setup for quantum dissipative systems  @xcite , which suggests to view a quarkonium in a medium as such an open quantum system  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , it becomes natural to study the dynamical evolution of @xmath0 pairs in a medium with the help of the techniques developed in the context of quantum dissipative systems . in a forthcoming paper  @xcite",
    ", we shall consider a wavefunction - based approach to obtain the dynamics of quarkonia . here , we use the master - equation formalism , and derive the time evolution of the populations of @xmath0 states  @xcite , as well as of the momentum distribution of the quarkonia .",
    "for the latter , we show that it satisfies a fokker ",
    "planck equation , with transport coefficients fixed by the microscopic model .",
    "various kinetic frameworks for the dynamics of quarkonia in a medium have been considered in the literature , based on the boltzmann  @xcite , fokker ",
    "planck or langevin equations  @xcite or rate equations  @xcite , to model the destruction and ( re-)formation of bound @xmath0 states in phenomenology - oriented studies . here",
    "the open - quantum - system approach to heavy quarkonia in a medium provides a natural underlying microscopic description that leads to such a kinetic model .    in sect .",

    "section  [ s : modeling ] introduces our model for the heavy quarkonia , the medium , and their interaction between them .",
    "since we intend the present study to be of exploratory nature , we deliberately adopt a simplified model , instead of more realistic ones .",
    "our results for the evolution of both the internal and external degrees of freedom , namely the populations of the various states and the @xmath0-pair momentum distribution function respectively , are presented in sect .",

    "[ s : discussion ] , where we also consider how these results might be modified in an evolving medium .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the master - equation description of quantum dissipative systems for the sake of self - containedness ( a longer presentation can be found e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . after introducing in sect .",
    "[ s : generic_model ] the generic setup and its description , we present the equations that govern the evolution of the dissipative system , starting with its internal degrees of freedom ( sect .",
    "[ s : m_eq_int_dof ] ) and then turning to the external ones ( sect .  [ s : m_eq_ext_dof ] ) .",
    "generically , the setup for a quantum dissipative system consists of a ( small ) system @xmath1 coupled to another quantum system @xmath2 , called environment  or reservoir , if it has infinitely many degrees of freedom , as we shall assume from now on .",
    "the total system @xmath3 is assumed to be closed .",
    "it is then described by a hamiltonian , taken to be of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the free hamiltonian of the small system ( in the absence of the environment ) , @xmath6 is the free hamiltonian of the reservoir , and @xmath7 describes the interaction between system and environment .",
    "hereafter , we shall model the reservoir as a set of harmonic oscillators , labeled by a subscript @xmath8 , whose proper frequencies @xmath9 span a large continuum , encompassing the bohr frequencies of the free hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the density operator of the free reservoir .    for the interaction term in the hamiltonian , we consider a coupling of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 acts on @xmath1 only , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the annihilation and creation operators for oscillator @xmath8 , and @xmath15 measures the corresponding coupling .    for a large reservoir ,",
    "the autocorrelation function @xmath16 takes non - negligible values only in a small interval around @xmath17 , of typical size @xmath18 .",
    "evolution equations for quantities pertaining to the small system are conveniently obtained by introducing first the density operator @xmath19 of the total system , whose evolution is then governed by heisenberg s equation with the hamiltonian  . iterating the latter ( in the dirac interaction picture ) and performing a partial trace over the reservoir degrees of freedom",
    ", one finds an exact , yet non - local in time , evolution equation for the `` reduced '' density operator @xmath20    to obtain more tractable equations , a few simplifying hypotheses are needed .",
    "the first one consists of assuming that the total density operator is factorizable at any time : @xmath21 this amounts on the one hand to neglecting correlations between the small system and the reservoir beyond a certain order in the interaction term  typically , beyond second order . on the other hand , keeping the free density operator @xmath10 in the presence of an interaction with @xmath1 amounts to assuming that the latter does not modify the reservoir properties , which is reasonable for the application we have in mind .",
    "the second assumption is that the typical time scale for the evolution of the small system should be much larger than the typical time scale @xmath18 of the reservoir fluctuations .    under these two hypotheses",
    ", one can derive a first - order differential `` master '' equation for the reduced density operator @xmath22  @xcite .      in a first step",
    ", one can focus on the evolution of the internal degrees of freedom of the small system , momentarily leaving aside its motion .",
    "let @xmath23 , @xmath24 denote the eigenstates of the free hamiltonian @xmath5 , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 the corresponding energies .",
    "in the basis spanned by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the elements of the reduced density operator obey a set of coupled first - order differential equations with constant coefficients .    for our purpose , it is sufficient to consider the diagonal elements @xmath29 , corresponding to the populations of the energy eigenstates .",
    "these populations satisfy coupled einstein equations of the form @xmath30 with transition rates given ( when considering the master equation up to second order in the interaction term ) by fermi s golden rule . for @xmath31 and @xmath32 the corresponding bohr frequency , one easily finds    [ gamma_em&abs ] @xmath33    where @xmath34 denotes the average number of excitations in mode @xmath8 .",
    "these rates obviously correspond to emission ( with the @xmath35 term accounting for spontaneous emission ) and absorption , respectively .",
    "time dependence of the populations of the states of a 4-level system coupled to a thermal bath .",
    "the straight lines correspond to the equilibrium values at the bath temperature . ]    to exemplify the behavior of populations described by eqs .",
    "- , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : thermal_int_dof ] the time dependence of the populations of a 4-level system @xmath1 , initially in its ground state , in contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath36 . in that case",
    ", @xmath34 is given by the average occupation number for bose ",
    "einstein statistics . after a transient regime ,",
    "the populations reach stationary values , which are simply proportional to the corresponding boltzmann factors : @xmath37 we thus find that the internal degrees of freedom of the small system equilibrate at temperature @xmath36 .      if we also consider the motion of the center of mass of the small system , then momentum transfers due to emission or absorption of excitations from the reservoir now play a role . in addition , the dependence of the interaction term   on the position @xmath38 of the small system should now be taken into account .",
    "for the case we shall be interested in later on , this can be done by replacing @xmath13 by @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "the main difference with the static case is that the eigenstates of the free hamiltonian @xmath5 are states with not only different internal quantum numbers , but also different momenta , corresponding to the @xmath41 part of @xmath5 , with @xmath42 the mass of the small system and @xmath43 its total - momentum operator .",
    "consequently , the eigenstates should be labeled with the eigenvalue @xmath44 besides the `` internal '' label @xmath45 .",

    "it is convenient to consider the position - dependent part of the interaction hamiltonian apart from the rest .",
    "this part , convoluted with the position - dependent part of the @xmath5 eigenstates  namely plane waves  gives rise to a momentum - conservation enforcing term @xmath48 in the matrix element @xmath49 .",

    ", the sums over @xmath56 disappear thanks to the momentum - conservation condition .",
    "further analytical progress with the population evolution equations requires additional assumptions , namely first that the frequency shifts @xmath53 , @xmath54 remain much smaller than the typical width @xmath57 of the bath spectral distribution ; and , secondly , that the momentum transfer @xmath58 be much smaller than the width @xmath59 of the populations @xmath60 , viewed as momentum distributions .",
    "let the sum of the populations @xmath60 over all internal states @xmath45 be denoted by @xmath61 , which then represents the momentum distribution function of the small system , irrespective of its internal state . as shown in appendix  [ s : evol_closed ] , under the assumptions mentioned above the rate of evolution for @xmath62 is much slower than the individual rates @xmath63 , and one can show that @xmath62 is governed by @xmath64 +    \\kappa\\,\\triangle_{\\bf p}\\pi({\\bf p},t),\\ ] ] i.e.  an equation of the fokker ",
    "planck type , in momentum space , with constant coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the former describes the damping rate of both the average momentum and ( up to a factor of 2 ) the variance of the momentum distribution , while the latter characterizes the growth of this variance .",
    "when the reservoir in which the small system evolves is a thermal bath , both coefficients are related to each other through the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath67 which shows that in the stationary regime , the small system has thermalized at the bath temperature @xmath36 .",
    "as stated in the introduction , our goal in the present paper is not to propose a full treatment of the dynamics of heavy quarkonia in a thermalized medium based on the most refined existing models for quarkonia and their interaction with the medium .",
    "our purpose is rather to explore possible new qualitative phenomena , which emerge when the point of view on the problem is shifted from the usual approaches to the description as a quantum dissipative system  @xcite .    for that reason , the models we introduce hereafter for the quarkonia ( sect .",
    "[ s : model_onium ] ) and their coupling to the medium ( sect .",
    "[ s : model_interaction ] ) will be quite simplified , yet not unrealistically . for the `` reservoir '' with which the @xmath0 states interact , we consider two possibilities : either a thermal bath , or a peaked distribution ( sect .  [ s : model_bath ] ) .      in nuclear collisions at sufficiently high energies , the medium which is created and which is probed by heavy quarkonia should be deconfined , and thus consist of quarks and gluons as relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we consider a medium made of pure glue , and forget the constantly created quark - antiquark pairs , which would not affect the qualitative features of our description .",
    "we assume that this gluon plasma is unpolarized , isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "this plasma can then be modeled  for example by quantizing the @xmath68 gauge fields canonically in the weyl gauge  as a set of oscillators . within the master - equation formalism ,",
    "the only characteristic we need is the mean number of excitations @xmath34 for each mode @xmath8 , see the transition rates   and  .    in the following",
    ", we shall make use of two different kinds of gluon bath .",
    "first , we shall consider a thermal bath , i.e.  a reservoir in thermal equilibrium , at a temperature @xmath36 .",
    "the associated density operator reads @xmath69 in the absence of the small system .",
    "the corresponding @xmath34 is given by the usual bose ",
    "einstein distribution .    the second model of reservoir we shall employ consists of assuming a gaussian distribution @xmath70,\\ ] ] peaked around some variable value @xmath71 , for the average number of excitations .",
    "although this is of less immediate relevance for the phenomenology of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions than the thermal bath , yet it will allow us to illustrate some features of our description .",
    "this second model will be referred to as the `` gaussian bath '' .      strictly speaking , to implement the master - equation formalism described in sect .",
    "[ s : evol_eq ] one only needs matrix elements for reservoir - induced transitions between states of the small system . specifying the states themselves and",
    "the transition - inducing interaction is not necessary .",
    "accordingly , for the study of the dynamics of heavy quarkonia in a gluon plasma , one should identify all single- or multi - gluon processes that change the state of a @xmath0 pair  be it a transition between two different bound states  @xcite , gluon - induced dissociation  @xcite , or the possible recombination of a quark and an antiquark into a bound state  @xcite , and consider the corresponding matrix elements .",
    "such an exhaustive procedure is certainly desirable for making quantitative predictions that can meaningfully be compared to experimental results .",
    "here we remain at an exploratory level , and search the _ qualitative _ behaviors of quarkonia in a medium .",
    "to make amend for our not using the most accurate set of matrix elements , we do not restrict ourselves to postulating such a set , but we shall start from scratch , i.e.  from a model of quarkonia in the vacuum , and of their interaction with the gluon plasma introduced above .    for the purpose of identifying new phenomena , the bottomonium system , with its larger number of bound states likely to survive above the deconfinement temperature  @xcite",
    ", seems to us more promising than the charmonia . a further advantage of bottomonia , is that ( in vacuum ) they can reasonably be described as bound energy eigenstates , with simple wavefunctions , of a one - gluon - exchange coulomb potential @xmath72 with @xmath73 the usual color factor and @xmath74 the dimensionless ( running ) coupling constant , here @xmath75 .",
    "for charmonia , this would be a less satisfactory description .",
    "there are several drawbacks to our modeling bottomonia as @xmath76 pairs bound by a coulombic potential .",
    "first , the eigenstates of potential   come in degenerate subsets , while this degeneracy  which prevents direct transitions between degenerate states  is lifted in the corresponding bottomonia . to allow such direct medium - induced transitions , we lift the degeneracy by hand , and give the states their vacuum masses  @xcite .",
    "another issue is that not every known bottomonium has been assigned all its quantum numbers , and some states ( e.g.  in the 1@xmath77-quintuplet ) have not yet been identified experimentally . to deal with these `` missing states '' , we retain the degeneracy of states within @xmath78-wave triplets and @xmath77-wave quintuplets , even when they are differentiated experimentally .",
    "thirdly , while potential   admits an infinity of bound states , only a handful of bottomonia are actually stable against the strong interaction . and",
    "last , even though the scattering states of the coulomb potential are known , yet we found it disturbing to use them to describe transition processes ( dissociation or recombination ) between bound bottomonia and free ( anti)quarks , given that the latter do not exist in the vacuum . to cope with both these problems , we made a drastic assumption , namely that the bound eigenstates of potential   above and inclusive the @xmath79-level stand for unbound @xmath76 states .",
    "additionally , we forbid by hand transitions from such `` unbound '' states back to bound ones .    the resulting spectroscopy of states we consider , with the transitions between them which we shall detail in sect .",
    "[ s : model_interaction ] , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectro ] .",
    "note that this slightly differs from the spectroscopy we used in  @xcite , inasmuch as we have now added the @xmath77-wave states , which will impact our results due to their large overlap with the @xmath78-wave states .",
    "to estimate the error on our results , we also add one further level of ( unbound ) states , to which the bound levels can transition , but which can not transition back .",
    "scheme of the spectroscopy of @xmath76 states and their transitions used in the calculations . ]      eventually , we need to specify the interaction between a @xmath0 pair and the gluon plasma . in this work",
    "we restrict ourselves to considering dipolar coupling , which induces vector transitions in the @xmath0 system .",
    "states . while this is certainly true , yet it should be kept in mind that the model of quarkonia as pure bound @xmath0 states is only approximate : taking account the sea , an improved picture for a quarkonium is rather @xmath80 where the @xmath0 pair in @xmath81 , @xmath82 ...   can be in the octet representation , i.e.  each quarkonium actually contains some admixture of color octet @xmath0 . ]",
    "this amounts to considering the coupling of the @xmath0 pair to the dipolar part of the chromoelectric field of the gluons , which for an unpolarized plasma yields the interaction term @xmath83    with @xmath84 the size of the box in which the chromoelectric field is quantized ( which also appears in the normalization of the @xmath76 eigenstates ) and @xmath85 the polarization vector of gluon @xmath8 , while @xmath86 ( resp .",
    "@xmath87 ) denotes the dipole ( resp .  radius ) operator for the @xmath0 pair .",
    "such an interaction term induces , to first order , transitions between @xmath0 states with different orbital quantum numbers only , as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectro ] .",
    "note that the dipolar coupling   actually rests on the assumption that both quark and antiquark in the pair see the same chromoelectric field .",
    "that is , we implicitly assume a large wavelength in computing the rates . while this holds for the gluons that induce transitions between bound states , yet it might not be granted for gluons that would dissociate the ground quarkonium state  for which one could instead use the rate computed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which we did not do .",
    "within the framework of the model we have introduced in the previous section , we can now turn to solving the evolution equations for the populations of bottomonia in a thermal medium at temperature @xmath36 .",
    "following the same order as in sect .",
    "[ s : evol_eq ] , we first present results for the evolution of the internal degrees of freedom ( sect .",
    "[ s : results_int - dof ] ) , then for the dynamics of the quarkonium center of mass ( sect .",
    "[ s : results_ext - dof ] ) . in appendix",
    "[ s : gaussian - bath ] , we present results for the evolution in a gaussian bath .      inspecting the set of equations   that govern the behavior of the populations when",
    "medium - induced emission and absorption processes are taken into account , a first result strikes the eye , even before solving the equations .",
    "let the populations @xmath88 be combined into a vector @xmath89 and the system   be rewritten as @xmath90 with @xmath91 the time - evolution operator for the populations . in the vacuum ,",
    "the matrix representation of @xmath91 in the basis of the energy eigenstates of the @xmath0 system ( ordered in increasing energies ) is triangular .",
    "this is no longer the case in the presence of a medium .",
    "consequently , the eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath91 are not the same in a medium as in its absence .",
    "is indeed diagonalizable , see ref .",
    "physically this implies that the higher - energy @xmath0 states do not evolve independently from the more bound ones , as in the vacuum : because of medium - induced transitions , the former become coupled to the latter . as a consequence , past a transient regime ,",
    "the populations of all states evolve with the same time scale .",
    "this holds irrespective of the assumed matrix elements between the @xmath0 states ",
    "provided every state is coupled to each other , at least indirectly . however , the value of the time scale is model - dependent and depends on the matrix elements and on the bath properties .",

    "the curves do not change significantly if we include one further level of unbound states ( not shown ) .",
    "after the first @xmath96 or so , one reaches a quasi - equilibrated regime where the populations of all vacuum bound states decay with a characteristic time scale of 1.5  @xmath96 , while their ratios remain stationary .- wave states .",
    "] this result should be contrasted with the sequential - melting picture , where states would either be there , or totally melted according to the medium temperature , but can not be regenerated through transitions from other states .    in a thermal bath at @xmath97 ,",
    "we find 8  @xmath96 for the time scale of bottomonium evolution : as could be anticipated , the time scale decreases with rising temperature .",

    "fig : ratios(t ) ] their dependence on the temperature of the plasma .",
    "these ratios differ significantly from their values for thermally equilibrated bottomonia , as would be expected in the framework of a statistical model  @xcite .",
    "this difference can easily be traced back to our forbidding transitions from unbound states to bound ones , so that the detailed balance condition @xmath98 which guarantees the existence of an equilibrium with populations proportional to the respective boltzmann factors ( see sect .",
    "[ s : m_eq_int_dof ] ) , does not hold here .",
    "one could argue that we have put this deviation from thermal equilibrium at long times by hand , by forbidding some of the emission transitions .",
    "this is true , but ultimately due to our over - simplified modeling of unbound states .",
    "as long as only a finite number of them is explicitly included , together with the back transitions , then equilibrium is reached after some finite time , which increases very rapidly with the number of states .",
    "when unbound states form a continuum , equilibrium is reached infinitely late , which is what we have modeled by setting some transition rates to 0 .",
    "now that we have understood the internal dynamical evolution of the quarkonia , we can turn to investigating the evolution of the external degrees of freedom , and especially of the momentum distribution .",
    "more precisely , we wish to consider the dynamics of the `` momentum distribution of bound quarkonia '' @xmath62 , defined as the sum over all bound levels of the populations @xmath99 , where the density matrix is taken in the basis of the ( vacuum ) energy eigenstates .",
    "this distribution can evolve under the influence of two different effects induced by the plasma .",
    "first , the @xmath0 bound state can be dissociated , i.e.  it is `` lost '' from the populations that enter @xmath62 , which thus decreases with time .",
    "more precisely ( see appendix  [ s : evol_open ] ) , @xmath62 decays exponentially , with a rate that depends on @xmath44 .",
    "the latter point is easily understandable , inasmuch as the energy of the gluons that interact with the moving @xmath0 pair is doppler - shifted , so that pairs with different momentum do not see the same gluon spectrum .    on the other hand",
    ", the gluons can also induce internal transitions between bound states of the @xmath0 pair . in that case",
    ", the master - equation formalism predicts that , at least at small momentum @xmath100 and for small momentum transfers @xmath101 , the rate of change of @xmath62 is significantly slower than the rates of the individual populations . furthermore , in this regime the momentum distribution obeys the fokker ",

    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : fp_coefs ] the temperature dependence of the drift and diffusion coefficients in this equation , computed for the same bottomonium system as in sect .",
    "[ s : results_int - dof ] , in a thermal bath .",
    "as can be checked , these coefficients satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation relation  .",
    "while this hints at the equilibration of the external degrees of freedom of the bottomonia in a thermal plasma , yet one should keep in mind that the relevant time scale @xmath102 might actually be significantly larger than the time scale for bottomonium dissociation .",
    "in this paper , we have applied the master - equation formalism to describe the evolution of heavy quarkonia in a gluon plasma , in complete analogy with the evolution of a small quantum system in contact with a reservoir .",
    "independently of the model we used for the quarkonia , the plasma , and their interaction , several generic features emerge :    1 .",
    "when transitions between the various quarkonium states are allowed , then in the presence of a medium at fixed temperature , after a transient regime a stationary stage is reached , in which the populations of all states evolve together , as illustrated by fig .  [",
    "fig : bottom(t)_5tc ] .",
    "the ratios of these quasi - equilibrated populations in the stationary regime differ from the ratios in a statistical model for quarkonia in thermal equilibrium with the plasma , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios(t ) ] .",
    "the momentum distribution of bound quarkonia , considered irrespective of the internal state , satisfies a fokker ",
    "planck equation , at least in the non - relativistic regime .    a further expected behavior  which we have not investigated in the present work ,",
    "but manifests itself when studying the non - diagonal elements of the density matrix  @xcite  is that the interaction with the medium shifts the energy levels of the small system with respect to their vacuum values .",
    "for the sake of illustration , we considered a simplified model for the heavy quarkonia , and more particularly for bottomonia rather than charmonia , and for the medium - induced transitions . despite the rudimentary character of these models , the numerical values that come out for the characteristic time scale of the evolution of bottomonium populations and for the drift coefficient in the fokker ",
    "planck equation , including their dependence on temperature , are actually very similar to the values derived in more elaborate models for the @xmath94 lifetime  @xcite and for transport coefficients in the hard - thermal - loop approach  @xcite .",
    "this is an encouraging finding , that shows the potential of the approach .    here",
    "we wish to emphasize again that the starting point for the implementation of the formalism is either transition rates or , if one wants to start from scratch , a description of the quarkonia _ in vacuum _ and of the interaction with the medium .",
    "it is certainly tempting to use an in - medium quark - antiquark potential  @xcite .",
    "yet one should not forget that such a potential already accounts for part of the coupling to the plasma , which then has to be subtracted out in a consistent manner from the other ingredients of the model , to avoid double counting .",
    "for instance , one can qualitatively expect that the screening of the potential in an in - medium potential picture corresponds to an increase of the transition rates from bound to unbound states in the formalism of the present paper .",
    "reformulating this differently , the master - equation formalism provides an evolution equation for the reduced density operator describing the quarkonia . under the assumptions that make it local in time",
    ", this equation might be equivalent to a heisenberg equation for @xmath103 involving a hamiltonian with an effective potential , which incorporates the influence of the plasma , irrespective of whether the latter is in thermal equilibrium or not .",
    "since we used a simplified vacuum quark - antiquark potential , we have not attempted to extract some corresponding effective potential . to @xmath104 . ]",
    "even then , it is clear that this in - medium potential would include an imaginary part , to account for the non - unitarity of the evolution of @xmath103  @xcite .    for a future application to a more precise description of heavy quarkonia and their interaction with the fireball created in ultrarelativistic nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions , one should discuss two aspects , namely the validity of the assumptions underlying the master - equation formalism and the relevance of the features listed above in the context of interest .",
    "the main hypotheses behind the derivation of the master equation are twofold .",
    "first , the formalism holds provided the characteristic time scale of the medium fluctuations is much smaller than the time scale of the small system dynamics .",
    "this ensures that the possible correlations between medium and small system are continuously washed out , so that the evolution of the latter is markovian .",
    "given the size of the medium  equilibrating `` parton '' gas , quark - gluon plasma or hot hadron gas  created in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , this point is warranted . the second hypothesis , namely that of a `` weak '' coupling , which underlies the use of transition rates given by fermi s golden rule , is actually less crucial . in a forthcoming study  @xcite , we shall introduce an alternative approach releasing this assumption ; however , the coupling strength does not affect the qualitative results summarized above .    even though the master - equation approach seems to be applicable , at least as a good approximation ,",
    "yet for the evolving medium created in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , some of those results have to be reexamined .",
    "thus , the rate of evolution of the medium might be comparable to the rates of quarkonium - plasma interaction , and prevent the equilibration of the internal and external degrees of freedom of the quarkonia .",
    "evolution of bottomonium populations in a thermal bath with evolving temperature . ]    as an example , we present in fig .  [ fig : bottom(t ) ] the evolution of the populations of bottomonia in a deconfined plasma whose temperature decreases with time as found at the center of the interaction region in hydrodynamical simulations of pb  pb collisions at lhc energies  @xcite .",
    "one can see that the various bound states do not evolve similarly , so that the ratios of their populations do not remain constant , in contrast to point  1 above . similarly , the description of the evolution of the momentum distribution of bound states through a fokker ",
    "planck equation , which relies on the equilibration of the internal degrees of freedom , does not hold either if the fireball cools down too rapidly .",
    "this shows that results derived within a stationary picture for the quarkonia and/or the medium might actually not hold when real - time evolution is taken into account .",
    "the master - equation formalism , and other descriptions of dissipative quantum systems , can accommodate such a real - time evolution , since the assumptions made about the medium are rather minimal .",
    "here we have shown that such an approach is possible , yet an accurate modeling of the dynamics of heavy quarkonia in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions deserves further investigation .",

    "in this appendix , we detail the derivation of the fokker  planck equation that describes the evolution in a medium of the momentum distribution @xmath62 of _ bound _ quarkonium states .    as stated in sect .",
    "[ s : modeling ] , within our model one has to distinguish between transitions between bound @xmath0 states , which can take place in both directions , and transitions between a bound state and an unbound one , which can be dissociation processes only .    for the sake of brevity , we hereafter consider two different systems  coupled to reservoirs  with each two non - degenerate levels @xmath105 .",
    "let @xmath106 , @xmath107 denote the diagonal elements of their respective reduced density matrices in the energy eigenstate basis .",
    "in the first system ( `` system i '' ) , both levels correspond to `` bound states '' that can transition to each other .",

    "planck equation from the boltzmann equation without mean field term  @xcite .",
    "the smallness of @xmath132 then amounts to considering that soft momentum exchanges with the bath play the major role in the evolution of the motion of the small system .",
    "eventually , since the frequency shift due to the doppler effect increases with the system momentum , the requirement of a small @xmath133 implies that the description might not hold at high momentum .",
    "in this appendix , we wish to take advantage of the fact that the master - equation formalism can accommodate various models of reservoirs , not only thermal baths , and demonstrate that our model of quarkonia in a gluon plasma naturally incorporates a behavior which is expected on physical grounds .    for that , we immerse bottomonia in the ground @xmath146(1s ) state at @xmath95 in the gaussian bath  , keeping the same models for @xmath76 pairs and their interaction with the plasma as in sects .",

    "the populations evolve similarly to the case of a thermal bath at @xmath92 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : bottom(t ) ] . on the other hand , for @xmath150",
    "there is almost no evolution over the same time interval .",
    "the physical interpretation of the latter finding is simple , namely that the gluons in the second bath are too energetic to view the bottomonia as a whole , and therefore can not excite or dissociate efficiently , as was already found ( for @xmath151 gluodissociation ) in ref .",
