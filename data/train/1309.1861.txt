    "@xcite found that the system is superconducting below 200 mk . the other intriguing phenomena the 2deg exhibits are electric field induced metal - insulator transition  @xcite and superconductor - insulator transition  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "there are strong evidences that the superconductivity coexists with a finite magnetic moment ( 0.3 - 0.4  @xmath2 per interface unit cell )  @xcite .",

    "scanning squid data reveals that , the sample contains sub - micrometer patches of ferromagnetic domain within a non - uniform background of weak diamagnetic superconducting susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "the highly unusual coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism has spawned several theoretical efforts to unravel the nature of states at the interface . as proposed by pavlenko , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , magnetism may not be an intrinsic property of the 2deg , but is a result of the spin splitting of the populated electronic states induced by oxygen vacancies in the srtio@xmath0 or laalo@xmath0 layer .",
    "the metallic behavior of the interface results from the 2d electron liquid produced by the electronic reconstruction .",
    "the metallic state is related to a superconducting state below 200 mk , occurring in regions of vanishing oxygen vacancies .",
    "michaeli , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite argued that due to strong spin - orbit interaction superconductivity and ferromagnetism can coexist via fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) type pairing at finite momentum ; the fflo state being quite sensitive to disorder while possibly even stabilized by strong disorder .    according to fidkowski , _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , droplets of superconductivity are formed in the bulk insulating srtio@xmath0 due to some imperfections in the lattice . in presence of laalo@xmath0 ,",
    "the mobile electrons in the 2deg mediate a coupling between the droplets which percolate and grow until a long - range superconducting order forms .",
    "another recent suggestion  @xcite is multi - band superconductivity resulting from percolation of filamentary structures of superconducting puddles .",
    "recently , randeria , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed that the ground state magnetization is a long - wavelength spiral aligning to a weak ferromagnetism in the presence of applied magnetic field .",
    "several studies have provided hints , but not yet conclusive support for the existence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism and their coexistence .",
    "it is now well - understood that the metallic conduction at the interface is mainly due to two reasons : the oxygen vacancies at the interface  @xcite and an intrinsic electronic transfer mechanism known as polar catastrophe in which half an electronic charge is transferred to the interface  @xcite .",
    "the electrons at the interface , which is tio@xmath3 terminated , occupy the 3d @xmath4 orbital of ti atoms .",
    "michaeli , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed out that there are three different bands , uniformly distributed at the interface , responsible for superconductivity and ferromagnetism .",
    "the @xmath5 band is wider than the @xmath6 , @xmath7 bands and is relatively lower in energy at the @xmath8 point .",
    "it is therefore likely that the electrons in this band get localized at the interface sites due to coulomb correlation and eventually form localized moments .",
    "a ferromagnetic local exchange interaction between the conduction band electrons and the local moments will thereafter lead to an effective in - plane zeeman field .",
    "the zener kinetic exchange may then order local moments as well .",
    "very recently , spectroscopic studies provided direct evidence for in - plane ferromagnetism of electrons with @xmath5 character  @xcite .",
    "another important feature of the system is the large rashba coupling which originates from the broken inversion symmetry in the two - dimensional interface plane .",
    "it is more or less evident that inhomogeneities at the interface , in the form of oxygen vacancies and intrinsic disorder , are an inseparable part of the interface .",
    "it is therefore likely that they have a profound effect on the long range orders and their coexistence at the interface . in the following analysis",
    ", we use inhomogeneous bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) theory to study the effects of non - magnetic disorder on superconductivity and magnetism at the interface in presence of a strong rashba coupling .",
    "our calculations show that due to large disorder , the system forms superconducting islands . at the regions where superconductivity is destroyed by disorder ,",
    "electrons order ferromagnetically along the plane due to the in - plane field forming ferromagnetic domains .",
    "this disorder - driven electronic phase separation enables superconductivity and ferromagnetism to coexist in the same sample in electronically phase - separated regions .",
    "electronic phase separation as a mechanism for coexistence of various long - range orders has been established in manganites in the last decade  @xcite .",
    "its role in the interfaces has also been posited by some experimental groups and a theoretical analysis in the present context is therefore eminently topical .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe our model for a rashba spin - orbit - coupled superconductor in presence of an in - plane zeeman field . in section  [ bdg_treatment ] , starting with the standard inhomogeneous bdg mean - field formalism , we present and analyze the effects of spatial inhomogeneity on superconductivity and ferromagnetism and their possible coexistence at the interface .",
    "in addition , we extend our analysis to finite temperatures and study the coexistence . sections  [ discussions ] and  [ conclusion ] are for discussions of results and concluding remarks .",
    "electrons at the interface occupy the @xmath4 bands of ti atom and therefore these bands are thought to be responsible for superconductivity and ferromagnetism in the system .",
    "the electrons occupying @xmath5 band , which is much wider than @xmath6 or @xmath7 bands and is lower in energy at the @xmath8 point , are localized due primarily to the electron - electron correlation at the interface .",
    "the local moments interact via exchange interaction with the electrons in conduction band ( claimed to be slightly below the terminating tio@xmath3 layer in the srtio@xmath0 side  @xcite ) leading to an in - plane zeeman field .",
    "superconductivity originates from a short - range electron - electron attractive interaction of strength @xmath9 ( possibly retarded by the phonon energies ) .",
    "the following hamiltonian describes a rashba spin - orbit coupled superconductor in an in - plane zeeman field .",
    "@xmath10 where , @xmath11 with hopping amplitude @xmath12 in a square lattice and chemical potential @xmath13 .",
    "the in - plane zeeman field is given by @xmath14 and the rashba coupling is @xmath15 , @xmath16 being the pauli matrices .",
    "the rashba spin - orbit interaction creates helical bands in which the electron spins are aligned with respect to the direction of propagation as shown in fig .",
    "[ bands_fs](a ) .",
    "the energy bands , created by the rashba soc with in - plane zeeman field , are given by @xmath17 and the corresponding eigenstates @xmath18 are obtained by the following transformation @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "in the chiral basis @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 is diagonal and @xmath23 has the pairing symmetry of @xmath1 superconductivity : @xmath24 with @xmath25 as the pairing amplitude . the zeeman field in the in - plane direction shifts the fermi surface from the center of the brillouin zone , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bands_fs](b ) and ( c ) , and therefore removes the degeneracy of a pair of electrons on the fermi surface with opposite wave vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "hence for pairing of electrons with same energy , it turns out to be energetically favorable to have a finite center of mass momentum ( proportional to the in - plane field  @xcite ) of the pair .    in a clean system ,",
    "the field due to moments at the interface is fairly strong and may even be larger than superconducting critical field  @xcite . in that case",
    "the system becomes magntically ordered . on the other hand ,",
    "if the field is not strong enough , supreconductivity may dominate in a homogeneous system .",
    "however , disorder has a significant effect on the superconducting state ( particularly for non - s - wave cases ) and in turn lead to islands of non - superconducting regions .",
    "phase segregation in real space is a likely outcome in such inhomogeneous situations and superconductivity and ferromagnetism coexist .",
    "the following bogoliubov - de gennes analysis explores the role of disorder on the superconductivity in such a system .",
    "the interplay between superconductivity and disorder has been a central issue of many recent investigations on superconductivity  @xcite . with increasing disorder , there exists a phase transition from superconductor to insulator in two - dimensional thin films  @xcite .",
    "the rashba spin - orbit interaction induces chiral @xmath28-wave superconductivity where anderson s theorem , unlike in conventional _",
    "s_-wave superconductors , is not applicable .",
    "hence , it is interesting to study the effect of non - magnetic disorder on a two - dimensional system with both ferromagnetism and unconventional superconductivity , especially when there is broken mirror symmetry .",
    "we consider the following bdg hamiltonian for a rashba coupled superconductor on a square lattice with an effective zeeman field along the @xmath29 direction ( without any loss of generality only the @xmath30-component of the field is considered for simplicity ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the random disorder in the local chemical potential , taken to be uniformly distributed between [ -w , w ] .",
    "@xmath33 is diagonalized via a spin - generalized bogoliubov - valatin transformation @xmath34 .",
    "this gives the following equation for the local order parameter @xmath35 in terms of the bogoliubov amplitudes @xmath36 and @xmath37 : @xmath38 \\end{split } \\label{delsi}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the fermi function at temperature @xmath40 .",
    "the in - plane magnetization density with exchange field along @xmath29 direction is obtained via @xmath41 the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is expected to be fairly small in the inhomogeneous , phase segregated situation with short superconducting mean - free path ( @xmath42 ) . in chiral superconductors , even for homogeneous condensates , this is a hotly debated issue and values of orbital moment range from @xmath43 per pair to @xmath44 or even @xmath45 ( i.e. , corresponding moment of order @xmath46 or 10@xmath47 ; for recent results and comments on this , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . clearly , in an inhomogeneous situation such as the one obtains in the interface ( with an intrinsically short @xmath42 ) , the total effect coming from the magnetic domains would be much reduced .",
    "the experimental indicators certainly do not subscribe to a large contribution to the angular momentum , though careful experiments like kerr rotation , x - ray circular dichroism , @xmath13sr and resonant raman scattering are needed to resolve this .",
    "we have , therefore , ignored this in the foregoing and restricted ourselves to the spin contribution only .",
    "the quasi - particle amplitudes @xmath36 and @xmath37 are determined by solving the following bdg equations : @xmath48 where @xmath49 $ ] .    in",
    "what follows , eq.([delsi ] ) and eq.([bdg eq . ] ) are solved self - consistently on a finite , large two dimensional square lattice with periodic boundary conditions and finally the mean values are calculated using @xmath50 and @xmath51 , over several realizations of the disorder .",
    "n is the total number of sites .",
    "the results presented here are obtained with @xmath52 lattice sites , which is large enough to obtain a quantitatively satisfactory description .",
    "we work in grand canonical ensemble with @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( consistent with previous work  @xcite ) and unless specified , the density of electrons is kept at half - filling .",
    "the case of filling away from half is discussed later .",
    "we first discuss our results at @xmath55 and later extend to finite temperatures .",
    "the inhomogeneous bdg method is useful to study the spatial variations of the pairing amplitude . in the large disorder regime ,",
    "the microscopic details turn out to be very important leading to new unanticipated results .",
    "[ disorder_maps ] shows the spatial distribution of the local pairing amplitude @xmath56 for different disorder strengths .",
    "the top and middle row show the development of superconductivity and magnetism separately while the bottom one reveals the full picture of coexistence . in the homogenous system ( @xmath57 )",
    ", superconductivity is uniform at the interface plane and the magnetic response is very weak .",
    "however , in the highly inhomogeneous case ( @xmath58 ) , the disorder abets in breaking the uniform suprconductivity into islands separated by non - superconducting regions . it is quite straightforward to understand the underlying physical situation within the bdg formalism .",
    "the regions where @xmath59 is small , superconductivity sets in easily while the regions of large number fluctuations , having large @xmath59 , militate against it .",
    "robust ferromagnetic puddles are formed at the regions where superconductivity is degraded by disorder .",
    "thus disorder helps the two competing phases to coexist by keeping them spatially seperated .",
    "a great deal of information about the nucleation of the pairing on the microscopic scale can be extracted from the data plotted in fig .",
    "[ disorder_maps ] . in fig .",
    "[ probability](a ) , we plot the distribution of the local pairing amplitude @xmath56 for a number of disorder strengths .    in the homogeneous system ( @xmath57 ) , there is a pronounced peak near @xmath60 , the mean - field value at @xmath55 . as the disorder increases , the peak at @xmath60 decreases",
    ", weight is gradually transferred to lower gap values and the probability for zero gap increases ( shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ probability](a ) ) , indicating the formation of non - superconducting regions .",
    "it is interesting to note that even for low disorder strength , regions with zero gap appear and long range superconducting order is severely affected as expected for a @xmath61 superconductivity ( in contrast with the s - wave case where the effect is indeed weaker  @xcite ) . from fig .",
    "[ disorder_maps ] , we extract the probability p(@xmath62 ) that the gap value is less than a given @xmath63 , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ probability](b ) .",
    "this clearly demonstrates how the propensity towards formation of low - gap ( and eventually gapless ) regions increases rapidly with increasing disorder .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ probability](b ) shows that the mean pairing amplitude @xmath64 decreases strongly with increasing disorder .",
    "however , it never vanishes , as pointed out by avishai , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ; even in the strong disorder limits there are always few superconducting regions with finite gaps .",
    "disorder has significant effects on the resulting ferromagnetic landscape described by the probability distribution of local magnetization in fig .",
    "[ probability](c ) .",
    "the peaks correspond to weak ferromagnetic background , which gradually shift towards zero as disorder increases .",
    "the tail at higher magnetizations , for @xmath65 reflects the formation of ferromagnetic puddles at higher disorder strength .",
    "however , for very strong disorder , the ferromagnetic domains are also destroyed , reflected in the nature of the variation of average magnetization ( inset ( ii ) of fig .",
    "[ probability](c ) ) . the competition between superconductivity and ferromagnetism",
    "is borne out from a comparison of the distributions p(@xmath62 ) and p(@xmath66 ) for pairing amplitude and local magnetization respectively . with higher disorder ,",
    "the probability p@xmath67 of gapped regions decreases ( fig .",
    "[ probability](b ) ) , while the regions of ferromagnetic domains increase ( inset ( i ) of fig .",
    "[ probability](c ) ) .",
    "thus the formation of robust ferromagnetism tracks the destruction of superconducting regions .",
    "such a correlation is crucial for the observed formation of microscopically phase separated regions of ferromagnetism and superconductivity at the interface  @xcite .      to get a better understanding of the nature of superconducting regions or the ferromagnetic domains and the range of their order , it is useful to study the disorder - averaged correlation functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    as depicted in fig .",
    "[ corr_func ] , both the correlation functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 falls rapidly , indicating the absence of any long - range order of magnetization or superconductivity .",
    "the rapid fall of the correlation functions within a few lattice spacings ( even for a weak disorder , @xmath72 , not shown ) , emphasizes the short range nature of the underlying order .",
    "it is also noted from the nature of these correlation functions at @xmath73 that superconductivity is more sensitive to disorder than ferromagnetism which persists where superconductivity is destroyed before disorder suppresses both .      in a disordered superconductor ,",
    "a very useful quantity that can be seen in tunneling experiments is the local density of states ( ldos ) , which , at zero temperature , is given by @xmath74\\ ] ]    with increasing disorder , states begin to appear in the gap and the nature of tunneling spectrum changes rapidly .",
    "the single - particle density of state is plotted in fig .",
    "[ ldos ] for different disorder strengths . in the homogeneous limit",
    ", there is a real gap in the dos , with the usual pile up of states on both sides of it . with increasing disorder , a pseudo - gap appears , reminiscent of the under - doped high-@xmath75 superconductors  @xcite or a superconductor in presence of high magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the pile up also smears out and the spectrum is pushed towards higher energy . therefore , in scanning tunneling microscopy , one would be able to observe regions of real gap with a pile up of states in the dos , separated by gapless ( or pseudo - gapped ) non - superconducting regions .",
    "these latter regions would also show up clearly in a magnetic force microscopy .      to explicitly understand how disorder affects superconductivity and to track the superconductor - insulator transition",
    ", one needs to study the superfluid density that characterizes superconducting phase rigidity .",
    "we calculate the superfluid density , defined from the effective drude - weight  @xcite , as @xmath76 the first term represents the diamagnetic response to an external magnetic field @xmath77 with the local kinetic energy @xmath78\\\\ & + ( 1-f(e_n))[v_{n\\sigma}^*(r_{i+\\hat{x}})v_{n\\sigma}(r_{i})+c.c ] ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] the second term is the paramagnetic response given by the disorder - averaged transverse current - current correlation function @xmath79 with @xmath80\\frac{f(e_{n_1})-f(e_{n_2})}{e_{n_1}-e_{n_2 } } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath81\\\\ & d_{n1,n2}^i=2[v_{n_1}(r_{i+\\hat{x}})v_{n_2}(r_i)^*-v_{n_1}(r_i)v_{n_2}^*(r_{i+\\hat{x}})]\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ]    note that the translational invariance is restored via a disorder averaging so that the correlation function is only dependent on the separation @xmath82 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ stiffness_dos ] , the superfluid density @xmath83 rapidly declines with the strength of disorder , nearly vanishing for @xmath84 and signifying the proximity of a superconductor to insulator transition driven by disorder .",
    "although quantum phase fluctuations play a crucial role in the superconductor - insulator transition in the large disorder regime  @xcite , it is beyond the scope of the current approach to incorporate such phase fluctuations .",
    "however , from the large suppression of the superfluid density by disorder , we can clearly observe the destruction of superconductivity as disorder strength increases .",
    "the sharp decline of stiffness with disorder is understandable in the present situation where there is large spatial fluctuation of the superconducting amplitude .",
    "since the stiffness measures rigidity against phase fluctuations , and in the mean - field bdg theory the phase is uniform throughout , under a phase twist at the boundary the system would accommodate steep adjustments of the phase change in regions where the superconducting amplitude is small .",
    "this destroys the overall phase rigidity rapidly over the islands with vanishing gap thereby producing the observed sensitivity to disorder .",
    "according to scanning squid data  @xcite , superconductivity , albeit spatially inhomogeneous , appears below a critical temperature .",
    "also , no temperature dependence of the ferromagnetic landscape has been observed over the measured temperature range . on the other hand ,",
    "the torque magnetometry measurement  @xcite reports a coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity below 120 mk with a superparamagnetic behavior , presumably from the magnetic domains , persisting beyond 200 mk .",
    "we therefore undertake a study of the system at finite temperatures with moderate disorder . for a homogeneous system",
    "the mean - field superconducting transition can be determined by the condition that the mean superconducting pairing amplitude vanishes . in an inhomogeneous situation ,",
    "such a criterion is no longer valid . in practice ,",
    "the superconducting transition is determined by the percolation of the superconducting regions in an insulating matrix , whereas an useful indicator for the transition is the vanishing of the correlation function .    in fig .",
    "[ temp_evolution ] , we show the temperature evolution of the spatial distribution of local pairing amplitude , magnetization and their coexistence at different temperatures for a constant disorder strength ( @xmath72 ) . the top and middle row show , as in fig .",
    "[ disorder_maps ] , the development of superconductivity and magnetism separately . with increasing temperature , superconductivity collapses rapidly nearly vanishing by @xmath85 ( fig .",
    "[ temp_evolution ] , top row , from left to right ) , signifying the onset of superconducting transition . concomitantly , ferromagnetism develops ( left to right , middle row ) due to the in - plane zeeman field as the temperature is raised .",
    "the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is shown in the lowest row of fig .",
    "[ temp_evolution ] as temperature rises .",
    "initially superconductivity dominates over the entire system while magnetism shows up in the non - superconducting regions as temperature rises , eventually setting up a near - uniform ferromagnetic state ( with small spatial fluctuations ) at higher temperatures ( @xmath86 ) in the entire area of the interface .    an interesting point to note",
    "is that , the average magnetization increases with temperature showing a peak near @xmath87 as in fig .",
    "[ temp_var](a ) .",
    "this observation is understood from fig .",
    "[ temp_var](b ) , where we plot the correlation functions as a function of temperature . beyond @xmath87 ,",
    "the superconducting correlation is nearly absent , ferromagnetism peaks ( albeit with spatial fluctuations due to disorder ) and then drops further on .",
    "the tail in fig .",
    "[ temp_var](a ) is extended to higher temperatures depending on the zeeman field and disorder strength .",
    "this picture is quite similar to the torque magnetometry results mentioned above where high temperature magnetism is found to survive beyond the putative superconducting transition temperature .",
    "our calculations provide a simple , yet effective description of the superconductivity , ferromagnetism and their coexistence observed at the interface at very low temperatures .",
    "we take a phenomenological model for superconductivity  @xcite in the presence of local moments along with rashba so interaction at the interface , favoring @xmath88-wave pairing at finite momentum .",
    "the localized moments interact with the itinerant electrons via a ferromagnetic exchange coupling acting like an in - plane zeeman field .",
    "our calculations reveal that the non - magnetic disorder play a decisive role in the emergence of the coexisting phase where superconductivity and ferromagnetism are phase - separated at microscopic scale . in the homogeneous case ,",
    "robust ferromagnetism is absent and superconductivity pervades the two - dimensional interface .",
    "ferromagnetism in the interface is facilitated by the disorder : isolated superconducting and insulating regions lead to coexisting superconductivity and magnetism .",
    "however at strong disorder , both the phases are affected by large local density fluctuations and tend to disappear . for concreteness , we also study the behaviour of the system at other fillings as depicted in fig .",

    ", superconductivity has a dome around half - filling and a robust ferromagnetism is established after the superconducting phase is degraded by disorder . however , the phase diagram shows a region of coexistence of an inhomogenous mixture of superconductivity and ferromagnetism .",
    "the general features of magnetism and superconductivity are reasonably well understood in terms of a single band model , although one could envisage a scenario where they occur in different bands as well .",
    "the essential physics is disorder - driven and it is possible to explain the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism within the framework of a single band .",
    "disorder - induced ferromagnetism has also been observed in bulk srtio@xmath0 substrate supporting the assertion  @xcite that there is a definite connection between the presence of impurity and observed ferromagnetism .",
    "rashba spin - orbit interaction favors an odd pairing superconducting state and a helical alignment of the electron spins without an overall net moment .",
    "however , the presence of in - plane exchange interaction and intrinsic disorder are likely to mitigate its effects and prevent such a long range helical magnetic order . therefore",
    ", phase segregation is a natural and most likely outcome as shown .",
    "rashba coupling , in fact , converts the _",
    "s_-wave superconductivity into a chiral _ p_-wave pairing which is very sensitive to non - magnetic disorder .",
    "the presence of the in - plane field and the finite momentum pairing then lead to spin precession at different rates ( the effect being weak , as the zeeman field is much weaker than spin - orbit scales ) for the partners of the pair depending on the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the dephasing coming from slightly different spin precession rates of the pair and disorder scattering effectively act as a strong pair - breaking mechanism , with disorder affecting fairly dramatically . as shown in fig .",
    "[ rashba_var ] , superconductivity is weakly affected by the spin - orbit coupling and while it is degraded , net magnetic moment increases concomitantly at larger spin - orbit coupling",

    "there is a quenching of magnetic moment when the system is annealed in oxygen environment  @xcite .",
    "an oxygen vacancy presumably adds two additional electrons which are , most probably , partially localized near the vacancy due to coulomb correlation and the reduction in magnetic moment after annealing is probably due to the reduction of oxygen vacancies by molecular oxygen .",
    "rashba spin - orbit coupling in presence of an applied perpendicular zeeman field leads to the appearence of spinless @xmath91-wave superconductivity which is a canonical example of topological superconductor hosting majorana bound states under certain conditions  @xcite . since the intrinsic zeeman field in the system is along the interface plane and brings asymmetry in the fermi - surface , it is quite unlikely to find any majorana state here .",
