    "thus there exists a continuous disintegration @xmath11 on @xmath16 , and there exist continuous linear operators @xmath53 and @xmath129 so that for all @xmath18 , the measure @xmath11 has mean @xmath55 and covariance operator @xmath56 . define the functions @xmath275 and @xmath276 .",
    "since @xmath111 is the identity operator on @xmath16 , and @xmath58 has operator norm @xmath0 , the statements immediately follow .",
    "suppose that @xmath245 is a subset of an abelian group .",
    "we say that a random field @xmath3 is stationary if its covariance function satisfies @xmath277 whenever @xmath252 , @xmath278 , @xmath279 and @xmath280 all belong to @xmath245 .",
    "since the covariance operator @xmath46 defines an inner product , the schwarz inequality implies @xmath281 if the field is stationary , then @xmath282 .",
    "consequently , for each @xmath269 , @xmath283 the ratio of these two quantities is always equal to @xmath221 , so @xmath2 .",
    "the author thanks janek wehr and joe watkins for many useful discussions and helpful feedback , and mark meckes @xcite for the simple proof of equation .",
    "the author is particularly indebted to nicholas vakhania and vaja tarieladze for their fundamental work on the subject of radon probability measures on banach spaces , and he hopes that this article does justice to their ideas ."
