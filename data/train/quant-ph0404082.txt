    "faced with the question of describing a quantum computation in terms of elementary operations , one is almost invariably tempted to answer by drawing lines signifying qubits and little boxes signifying unitary operators performed on them .",
    "thus quantum computation is usually viewed as some more or less complicated manipulation of the initial quantum state , the sum total and ultimate goal of which is to apply a certain unitary operator on it .",
    "measurement naturally appears at the very end of the computation , and is generally considered harmful for the coherence if it is included in the main body of the computation , due to its inherent irreversibility . in this respect ,",
    "the computational power bestowed on us by quantum computers appears to depend vastly on our ability to perform unitary operations on our qubits , postponing any measurements until the very end when the result of the computation is ready to be read off .",
    "in fact , the standard model of quantum computation @xcite consists of preparing a standard initial state @xmath0 , applying an arbitrary unitary transformation and performing measurements in the very end .",
    "the first indication that measurements can be an integral part of the main body of our quantum computation was given by the fault - tolerant constructions for the @xmath1/8 and the toffoli gates @xcite . both of these make use of measurements and special ancillary states for the fault - tolerant implementation of the gates , with the ancillary states in turn prepared by measurements .",
    "but trully , the ability to perform universal quantum computation based on measurements alone was not fully realized until recently .",
    "two explicit models for doing computation by measurements will be considered : the first one based on one - qubit measurements on a cluster state ( 1wqc ) @xcite , and the second one based on two - qubit measurements alone ( tqc ) @xcite .",
    "proofs for the universality of both of these models were obtained by reduction to the standard model : preparation of a standard initial state , the ability to perform any unitary operation with arbitrary accuracy and the ability to perform measurement , which is a natural constituent of them both .",
    "the ability to realize any unitary transformation was in turn reduced to proving that all gates from a universal set of gates ( typically taken to be the one consisting of all one - qubit gates and the cnot @xcite ) can be realized within each model .      in the 1wqc model , quantum computation",
    "is performed on qubits arranged in a regular lattice and prepared initially in a specific entangled state , known as the _ cluster state_. any desired computation is then encoded as a sequence of projective one - qubit measurements of these lattice qubits along certain bases . although the intermediate measurement results are random , by monitoring the measurement outcomes one is able to exploit the quantum correlations and readapt the future measurement bases in order to effectively steer forward the desired computation .",
    "thus an arbitrary trajectory in the hilbert space of the input state can be achieved , as quantum information is made to travel within the lattice from the measured qubits to their neighboring ones and thereover until the completion of the measurement sequence .",
    "conceptually , the easiest way to describe the cluster state is by giving its stabilizer generators . for each qubit , viewed as a lattice site in a lattice @xmath2 , the stabilizer consists of generators of the form @xmath3 where nbhd@xmath4 is",
    "the set of qubits in the neighborhood of the qubit @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a notation that will be used in this paper alternatively with the notation @xmath7 for the pauli matrices .",
    "the cluster state is a particular example of a family of states known as _ graph states _",
    ", which have stabilizer generators of the same form as the cluster state , with the exception that the vertices are not necessarily viewed as points on a lattice and the neighboring relations are generally given by an adjacency matrix .",
    "operationally , any graph state can be prepared by various methods .",
    "a simple realization is obtained by examining the stabilizer : all lattice qubits need to be initialized in the state @xmath8 , creating @xmath9 , and then a controlled - phase gate needs to be applied between all pairs of neighboring qubits .",
    "the controlled - phase , @xmath10 , in the computational basis takes the simple diagonal form @xmath11 these controlled - phase gates have the convenient properties that each acts symmetrically between the two qubits on which it is applied and also they all commute with one another .",
    "physically , the preparation of the graph state can be accomplished by applying the nearest - neighbor homogeneous ising @xmath12 interaction on the state @xmath9 for the appropriate period of time and then correcting the resulting state with local unitary operations .",
    "returning to the issue of how an arbitrary unitary operation can be realized on an already prepared cluster state , we recall that the requirement has been relaxed to just being able to realize all operators from a universal gate set . to this direction ,",
    "one way to prove the universality of the 1wqc model is to consider disjoint regions of the cluster and use each such region for simulating a certain quantum gate from our selected universal set . identifying the input qubits of one such region with the output qubits of the previous , an arbitrarily large succession of quantum operations",
    "can then be realized .",
    "disjoining lattice regions can be accomplished by selectively disentangling qubits from the cluster state , thus effectively deleting them from the initial lattice .",
    "a quick inspection of the stabilizer in fact shows that measuring a qubit in the computational basis is sufficient for this deletion . indeed",
    ", a measurement of the @xmath13 qubit in the computational basis corresponds to a measurement of the operator @xmath14 , which commutes with all stabilizer generators except for that one having the measured qubit as the correlation center , namely @xmath15 .",
    "thus measuring @xmath14 removes the generator @xmath15 from the stabilizer , while leaving all other stabilizer generators unaltered up to the removal of the measured qubit .    to complete the proof",
    "that performing one - qubit measurements on the cluster state is universal for quantum computation , in fig.@xmath16[cluster gates ] we explicitly show how certain elementary operations can be realized by one - qubit measurements on the appropriate qubit configurations @xcite .",
    "as already stated , universality then follows from our ability to simulate any operator from the universal set of one - qubit rotations and cnot .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      the first application of the remote-@xmath10 circuits of fig.@xmath16[remote_c - phase ] is a more economic way of doing computation in the 1wqc model using a two - dimensional cluster state . in that case , either a cnot pattern using extra teleportation steps for the control state ( fig.@xmath16[1wqc_cnot_square ] ) can be used or alternatively , a pattern with fifteen qubits ( fig.@xmath16[1wqc_compare]a ) has been proposed .",
    "again , we can use the @xmath10 instead of the cnot , replacing the known qubit - costly cnot realizations with the remote-@xmath10 pattern derived in fig.@xmath16[remote_c - phase]c , without sacrificing our ability to do universal quantum computation .",
    "the economy in qubits is apparent if we consider a typical computation block consisting of one - qubit unitaries applied to two logical qubits , which then interact through the cnot or alternatively the @xmath10 .",
    "these one - qubit unitaries can in general be decomposed in terms of the euler angles @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "but , since the rotations around the @xmath19-axis commute with the controlled - phase gates , it is sufficient to realize one - qubit unitaries of the form @xmath20 followed by a remote-@xmath10 gate at each repeated unit of the computation . composing the patterns of fig.@xmath16[cluster gates]a , b and eliminating the intermediate consecutive measurements in the @xmath21-basis ( which realize a redundant quantum wire according to fig.@xmath16[1wqc_tel ] ) , two measured qubits are needed to realize a @xmath20 rotation , in contrast to the four measured qubits needed to realize a general one - qubit rotation used originally in the 1wqc constructions .    comparing first the contruction of fig.@xmath16[1wqc_compare]a with the one of fig.@xmath16[1wqc_compare]b , the latter uses less than a third of the total number of qubits and a fifth of the computation length , with an increase of the computation width by one .",
    "computation is performed in a linear fashion from left to right , with the logical qubits separated by regions of qubits measured in the @xmath22-basis .",
    "the comparison is done by considering the repeated computation units per logical qubit in each case , denoted by the shaded regions in fig.@xmath16[1wqc_compare ] .",
    "the comparison with the cnot pattern of fig.@xmath16[1wqc_cnot_square ] can also immediately be made , if we observe that the remote-@xmath10 pattern already forms part of the former in the connection between the third and the ninth qubit .",
    "thus , using the remote-@xmath10 in place of the cnot proves more qubit - efficient for both these different cnot realizations .",
    "c +   +      secondly , the remote-@xmath10 circuit of fig.@xmath16[remote_c - phase ] suggests a method of affecting a controlled - phase gate between two qubits using measurements of operators of weight at most two .",
    "this provides an alternative and greatly simplified proof of the universality of two - qubit measurements in the tqc model , without the need for the preparation of the ancillary state @xmath23 .",
    "two different measurement procedures are implicit in fig.@xmath16[remote_c - phase]b . the first one , although not minimal in the number of two - qubit measurements used to affect the @xmath10 gate , will be useful as a method for constructing graph states in the following section . starting with the circuit of fig.@xmath16[remote_c - phase]b , we can interpret each of the boxes a and b as performing an incomplete two - qubit measurement on one half of the entangled state @xmath24 and the control and target qubits respectively .",
    "the state @xmath25 can also be prepared by a complete two - qubit measurement , giving a total of three two - qubit measurements to affect the controlled - phase gate according to this method .",
    "to elaborate on the exact measurements that will be needed , box a of fig.@xmath16[remote_c - phase]b can be viewed as realizing a measurement of @xmath26 followed by a measurement of the second qubit in the @xmath22-basis and similarly for box b. starting with the state @xmath27 , the subsequent measurement procedure should therefore be : ( 1 ) measure @xmath28 and @xmath29 , then ( 2 ) measure @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the analysis for the evolution of the stabilizer generators under the proposed measurement sequence is given in table [ table ] .",
    "to prove that the controlled - phase gate between the first and the fourth qubit is in fact realized , we also follow the evolution of the initial ( or logical ) @xmath21,@xmath22 operators on those qubits , denoted by @xmath32 , keeping in mind that @xmath10 after conjugation takes @xmath33 to @xmath34 and @xmath35 to itself .",
    "@xmath36    the measurement procedure with the minimal number of two - qubit measurements is obtained if we interpret the measurement of the second qubit as a measurement of @xmath37 ( box c ) and then the measurement on the third qubit as a measurement of @xmath38 ( box b ) as before .",
    "eliminating the second qubit altogether and renumbering the rest , the measurement procedure is : ( 1 ) measure @xmath39 , ( 2 ) measure @xmath40 and ( 3 ) measure @xmath41 .",
    "the last operator to be measured is chosen so that it anticommutes with the previously measured operator and therefore projects out the ancillary second qubit .",
    "although the two measurements @xmath39 and @xmath40 do not commute , we note that if the measurements are performed in the opposite order , then the gate is still applied if the ancillary qubit is initialized in the @xmath42 instead of the @xmath8 state and finally projected on the @xmath43-axis instead of the @xmath19-axis .    in case",
    "the cnot is to be realized instead of the controlled - phase , the measurement procedure above can be straightforwardly modified by conjugating the third qubit with a hadamard , thereby changing the measured operator @xmath40 to @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , a method for realizing the cnot using just two two - qubit measurements , essentially identical to the one we just presented , has already appeared in the literature in the context of fault - tolerance in higher - dimensional systems @xcite , but its relevance to the tqc model had not been hitherto appreciated .",
    "a surprising feature of our result in this section is that we have explicitly drawn a connection between the remote - cnot circuit of fig.@xmath16[remote_cnot ] and the seemingly unrelated method for affecting the cnot according to the measurement sequence @xmath44 , @xmath39 and @xmath45 , both of which have been proposed for the realization of the cnot gate in very different contexts and without reference to one another .",
    "it is interesting to note that only two two - qubit measurements are required to perform the @xmath10 gate according to this second measurement procedure , in contrast to the five two - qubit measurements needed to perform cnot in the method illustrated in fig.@xmath16[cnot ] .",
    "moreover , this is the minimal number of two - qubit measurements possible , since in order to simulate a two - qubit gate with measurements each one of the two qubits need to interact at least once with the ancillary state .      as discussed in the introduction , the cluster state forms a substrate for universal quantum computation within the 1wqc model .",
    "the essense of its universality lies in the observation that , by appropriately deleting qubits , an arbitrary sequence of gates taken from a universal gate set can be imprinted and then executed on it .",
    "but , as has been repeatedly hinted on in the literature @xcite , this is not necessarily the most beneficial way of thinking about doing computation in the 1wqc model .",
    "a powerful indication towards this comes from the surprising fact that all the computational task that lies within the clifford group can be executed simultaneously in the 1wqc , resulting in a transformation of the initial cluster state to a general graph state ( up to local pauli operators ) .    due to this fact and in cases when an application - specific quantum computer would be desirable ( we think of factoring , for example ) the computation can equally well be performed by circumventing the clifford part measurements and starting directly with a specific graph state .",
    "in addition , this may practically even prove preferable for reasons pertaining to the robustness of the computation : removing altogether the clifford part measurements will significantly reduce the total number of qubits involved in the computation , thus decreasing the possible locations of error .",
    "such application - specific graph states will then have to be constructed and verified ( using graph purification protocols @xcite ) before the computation initiates @xcite .",
    "since operationally any graph state can be realized by selectively applying the controlled - phase gate between pairs of adjacent qubits initialized in the @xmath8 state , it is interesting to investigate how a given graph state can be constructed within a measurement - based model for performing quantum computation . in particular , in this section we will discuss how the two measurement procedures for affecting the controlled - phase gate , that were inspired by the circuit of fig.@xmath16[remote_c - phase]b , give rise to explicit methods for constructing an arbitrary graph state .",
    "the first measurement procedure of the previous section can be used to affect the controlled - phase gate between the qubits in our graph , using as ancillae a number of copies of the state @xmath25 equal to the number of edges created . implementing the two - qubit measurements",
    "needed will require a number of measurement steps at least equal to the vertex degree of the graph under construction , since all measurements with support on a common qubit will have to be realized at different times .",
    "considering that all one - qubit measurements on the ancillary qubits can be performed simultaneously in the final step , the actual logical depth of the graph preparation will equal one plus the maximum vertex degree of the graph to be constructed .",
    "an example of the graph state preparation is shown schematically in fig.@xmath16[graph_prepare]a . in order to create all edges connected to the striped qubit of this graph , three two - qubit incomplete measurements ,",
    "each represented by a dashed triangle , must be done consecutively followed by three one - qubit projections performed simultaneously in the fourth and last step .",
    "c +   +   + ( -6.92,0.85):@xmath46 ( -6.92 , 0.32):@xmath47    at this point , it is intriguing to consider the similarities of this method for constructing graph states to the valence bond solid model for doing quantum computation @xcite .",
    "in fact , if the distinction between the qubits of the graph ( denoted by filled circles in fig.@xmath16[graph_prepare ] ) and the qubits in the entangled state @xmath25 ( dark dots ) is lifted and they are all viewed as physical qubits residing on different sites of a solid , then the correlations between the qubits in the entangled states can be interpreted as arising from valence bonds formed between qubits on neighbouring sites . in such a valence bond model , our viewpoint for constructing the graph state",
    "is retained by identifying in each site one of these physical qubits as the logical one and performing appropriate measurements locally on the sites in order to form the desired graph state .",
    "the subsequent computation can then be performed by one - qubit measurements , in accordance to the 1wqc model .",
    "naturally , the graph state can be constructed even in the absence of the ancillary entangled pairs , according to our second measurement procedure proposed in the previous section . in this case , a number of ancillary qubits equal to the number of edges of the graph will be needed . for each edge ,",
    "the measurement procedure then consists of two two - qubit measurements each performed between an ancillary qubit and one of the two vertices incident on this edge , followed by a projective measurement on the ancillary qubit .    as with our previous method for constructing the graph state",
    ", we would like to inquire into the extent to which this measurement sequence can be parallelized , calculating its logical depth . due to the fact that the number of two - qubit measurements with support on a given graph qubit equals its degree in the graph ,",
    "the logical depth of this measurement procedure is at least equal to one plus the maximum vertex degree of the graph under construction .",
    "recall that although the two measurements @xmath39 and @xmath40 do not commute , the controlled - phase gate is still applied even if they are performed in the opposite order , provided the ancillary qubit is initialized in the @xmath42 instead of the @xmath8 state and finally measured in the @xmath21-basis instead of the @xmath22-basis . with this observation in mind",
    ", the two - qubit measurement sequence for the construction of the graph @xmath48 can be thought of as an edge - coloring of the larger graph @xmath49 constructed by adding the ancillary qubits to the vertex set and dividing each edge of the graph @xmath48 into two , each between the originally adjacent vertices and the corresponding ancilla . in the new graph @xmath49 ,",
    "edges represent the two - qubit measurements to be performed and the requirement that all two - qubit measurements with support on a given qubit need to be executed in different time steps translates into the requirement that edges incident on a given vertex are colored differently . as a consequence",
    ", the logical depth of the measurement procedure will be given by the minimum number of colors to realize the edge - coloring of the graph @xmath49 .",
    "letting @xmath50 denote respectively the vertex and edge set of the graph @xmath48 , the graph @xmath49 will then be given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 enumerates the edges of @xmath48 and @xmath53 is used as a label for the @xmath54 ancillary qubit . the minimum number of colors necessary to color each edge of @xmath49 so that no two edges incident on the same vertex have the same color is defined as its _ edge - chromatic number @xmath55_. as we already remarked , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the maximum vertex degree of @xmath49 . for graphs with no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices , a remarkable theorem @xcite states that @xmath58 and for _ bipartite _ graphs ( also called _ two - colorable _ ) in particular , the equality @xmath59 has been proven @xcite .",
    "but in our case @xmath49 is always bipartite by virtue of the fact that the qubits of the graph @xmath48 are adjacent to ancillary qubits only .",
    "hence , the logical depth for the construction of the graph @xmath48 equals its maximum vertex degree @xcite plus one ( to account for the one - qubit projections of the ancillary qubits done simultaneously in the last step ) .",
    "an example for the use of this measurement procedure is given in fig.@xmath16[graph_prepare]b .",
    "in both measurement procedures mentioned above , the desired graph state is realized up to pauli operators that depend on all measurement outcomes .",
    "however , preparing the graph state up to local pauli corrections will not jeopardize the computation later performed on it , since these corrections can be absorbed in the initialization of the classical registers that will be used to buffer the subsequent measurement outcomes @xcite .",
    "the mapping that we derived between the two models for doing computation by measurement is eloquent of the deep structural similarities between them . in fact",
    ", the 1wqc model can be thought of as naturally emerging from the tqc once the restriction to one - qubit measurements is imposed . in such a case , the mapping reveals that the interaction between qubits will have to be mediated by a two - qubit unitary , which in the case of the 1wqc is taken to be the controlled - phase . in this respect ,",
    "our mapping sheds light on the inner workings of the 1wqc , helping us understand its operation on a more intuitive level .",
    "moreover , our mapping explicitly demonstrates the correspondence between the local pauli corrections in the tqc and 1wqc models , which had been strongly suggestive of an underlying connection between them since the time both models were developed .",
    "the mapping thus significantly simplifies the proofs for the operation of the 1wqc circuits that so far always allude to theorems based on the stabilizer formalism @xcite . if you would concede that the operation of either one of the 1wqc or tqc is more transparent , then this mapping facilitates the understanding of the other model .",
    "in particular , the less familiar model of the 1wqc is thus rendered less enigmatic and more apt for adaptation towards the ultimate goal of achieving fault - tolerance within this model with a realistically low threshold .    in the last section",
    "two methods were proposed for the direct construction of an arbitrary graph state making use of two - qubit measurements , one of which is strongly reminiscent of the valence bond model for quantum computation .",
    "apart from the inherent merit of the simplicity of the remote-@xmath10 gate construction itself , this also led us to propose a new scheme for realizing a universal set of operators within the 1wqc which is more qubit - effective than the known ones , as well as to considerably simplify the proof of the universality of two - qubit measurements in the tqc model .",
    "the basic construction emerging within only a few logical steps from the well - known remote - cnot circuit is another evidence that the mapping occupying the main body of this paper can be viewed as an attractive mental tool when thinking within the two models that perform computation by measurements for swiftly translating useful structures back and forth between them .",
    "we note that alternative but similar explanations of the workings of the 1wqc have been given by michael nielsen in unpublished notes @xcite .",
    "peter shor has also independently developed explanations for the 1wqc operation along similar lines . a systematic construction of one - way quantum computer models starting with the one - bit teleportation scheme @xcite , that complements the current work ,",
    "is investigated by andrew childs , michael nielsen , and one of us @xcite . during the final preparation of this work",
    ", a paper by simon perdrix that uses the one - bit teleportation scheme to further simplify the requirements of the tqc model has also come to our attention @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to robert raussendorf for numerous insightful discussions on the workings of the 1wqc and to ben toner for many helpful comments and corrections . p.a . and d.l are supported by the us nsf under grant no.@xmath16eia-0086038 , and d.l . is also supported by the richard tolman foundation .",
