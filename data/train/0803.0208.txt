    "quantum dot ( qd ) devices provide a unique opportunity to study the interplay between different basic quantum phenomena .",
    "a prime example is the interaction of a localized spin ( magnetic impurity ) with surrounding itinerant electron spins @xcite .",
    "this , known as kondo effect , manifests itself as a quasiparticle resonance in local density of states at the fermi level at low temperatures . in quantum dots coupled to normal electrodes",
    ", it leads to an increase of conductance at zero source - drain voltage .",
    "originally , the kondo effect in quantum dots was predicted theoretically in the late 1980s @xcite-@xcite and later demonstrated in a number of experiments @xcite-@xcite .",
    "experiments have confirmed the validity of the theoretical picture but also discovered new phenomena .",
    "those include observation of the kondo resonance at non - zero source - drain voltage @xcite , absence of even - odd parity effects expected for these systems @xcite , observation of singlet - triplet transition in magnetic field @xcite , splitting of the kondo resonance due to the ferromagnetism in the leads @xcite or interplay between magnetism ( kondo effect ) and superconductivity in carbon nanotube quantum dots @xcite .",
    "when the quantum dot is connected to superconducting electrodes ( s - qd - s ) , the low energy transport is mediated by the andreev reflections , according to which an electron impinging on a normal metal - superconductor interface is reflected back as a hole and the cooper pair is created in the superconductor @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is known to play a crucial role in various hybrid mesoscopic superconducting devices @xcite . in the s - qd - s system",
    "the andreev transport is strongly affected by the kondo effect , leading to the sign change of josephson current @xcite .",
    "the strong coulomb interaction prevents the tunneling of cooper pairs into qd , and the electrons tunnel via virtual processes .",
    "thus the electron transport is strongly suppressed .",
    "this argument is valid when the kondo temperature @xmath0 is smaller than the superconducting order parameter @xmath1 . on the other hand , when @xmath2 , the kondo effect is restored @xcite",
    "this picture has been confirmed experimentally in carbon nanotube qd @xcite .    in the present work",
    "i consider a slightly different setup with a quantum dot coupled to one normal and one superconducting electrode ( n - qd - s ) .",
    "this system has extensively been studied both theoretically @xcite-@xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "early theoretical works have predicted the enhancement of the conductance due to the andreev reflections @xcite , while the others have predicted the suppression of it @xcite .",
    "later on , it has been shown that the behavior of the andreev conductance depends on the model parameters and can be enhanced or suppressed @xcite .",
    "the experiment by graber _",
    "@xcite shows that the conductance of n - qd - s system is suppressed in the kondo regime .",
    "the investigations of the n - qd - s systems have focused on electron transport only , and there is no study of thermoelectric properties . however , as is well known , the thermoelectric properties are the source of additional information to that obtained from other transport characteristics . thermal properties ( thermopower and thermal conductance ) of strongly interacting quantum dot coupled to the normal and ferromagnetic leads have recently been investigated showing that thermopower is very sensitive and powerful tool to study the kondo effect @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to study the thermoelectric properties of the quantum dot coupled to one normal and one superconducting electrode .",
    "i will focus on the electric and thermal conductance , thermopower and related quantities like thermoelectric figure of merit which is a direct measure of the usefulness of the system for applications and wiedemann - franz ratio which indicates if the system is in the fermi liquid state .",
    "i will show that the superconductivity strongly modifies the thermal properties of the system leading to an increase of thermopower at low temperatures and to non - fermi liquid ground state .",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "the system is described by single impurity anderson model with very strong on - dot coulomb repulsion ( @xmath3 ) . in this limit",
    "there might be at most a single electron on the dot . to project out double occupied states it is convenient to introduce slave boson representation @xcite , in which the real dot electron operator @xmath4 is replaced by the product of boson @xmath5 and fermion @xmath6 operators ( @xmath7 ) subject to the constraint @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) denotes normal ( superconducting ) electrode , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for a conducting electron with the wave vector @xmath14 , spin @xmath15 in the lead @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the hybridization parameter between localized electron on the dot with energy @xmath18 and conducting electron of energy @xmath19 in the lead @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath1 is the superconducting order parameter in the lead @xmath11 , and its temperature dependence is chosen in the form : @xmath20 in superconducting state ( @xmath21 ) and 0 otherwise .    in order to calculate electric current @xmath22 and thermal flux @xmath23 flowing from the normal electrode to the qd",
    "i follow standard derivation @xcite and get @xmath24    \\nonumber \\\\         + \\frac{e}{h } \\int d\\omega \\mathcal{t}^a(\\omega )        \\left[f(\\omega - ev ) - f(\\omega + ev ) \\right ] ,   \\label{e_current}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath25    \\nonumber \\\\       + \\frac{1}{h } \\int d\\omega \\mathcal{t}^a(\\omega ) ( \\omega - ev )       \\left[f(\\omega - ev ) - f(\\omega + ev ) \\right ] , \\label{q_current}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the total current @xmath22 and thermal flux @xmath23 are divided into two parts , one associated with single particle processes ( @xmath26 ) and the other one corresponding to the andreev reflections ( @xmath27 ) . as usual",
    ", @xmath28 stands for the fermi distribution function , and @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are the transmittances associated with single particle tunneling and with andreev reflections , respectively .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath32 and the details of calculations can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the linear regime ,",
    "i.e. for small voltages @xmath33 and small temperature gradients @xmath34 , one defines the electric conductance @xmath35 , thermopower @xmath36 , and thermal conductance @xmath37 .",
    "the kinetic coefficients read @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 with equilibrium fermi function @xmath28 and total ( single particle and andreev ) transmittance @xmath41 . in numerical calculations",
    "constant bands of width 100 @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) have been assumed , and all the energies are measured in units of @xmath42 .",

    "the reason for such a behavior is twofold .",
    "first , at @xmath49 the single particle transport is completely blocked due to the lack of the electron states in superconducting electrode for energies smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "thus the only contribution to electric transport comes from the andreev reflections .",
    "note that the andreev reflections do not contribute to the thermal transport ( at @xmath49 ) , as the electron in converted into hole , and thus there is no energy transfer through the interface . at the same time",
    "the andreev scattering is only the mechanism which gives rise to electron transport ( the charge of @xmath50 is transferred through the interface ) .",
    "however , strong coulomb interactions on the dot prevent the tunneling of cooper pairs into qd , and the electrons in each pair can only tunnel one by one via virtual processes @xcite . as a result , the andreev tunneling is strongly suppressed .",
    "this is the second reason for such suppression of the electric conductance .",
    "corresponding linear thermopower @xmath11 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "linear thermopower @xmath11 as a function of temperature for various values of superconducting order parameter @xmath1.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    this quantity is very useful measure of the kondo correlations @xcite-@xcite . at high temperatures",
    "thermopower is positive indicating hole - like transport and at @xmath51 shows a broad maximum associated with single particle excitations . at low @xmath52 , where the transport is electron - like",
    ", the thermopower is negative . in the case of normal leads , the thermopower changes sign at the kondo temperature @xmath0 ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the sign change can be also understood from the fact that @xmath11 is sensitive to the slope of the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level . with lowering of temperature ,",
    "the kondo correlations lead to the development of a narrow resonance in the dos slightly above the fermi energy , and thus to a slope change at the @xmath53 . in the presence of superconductivity in one of the leads ,",
    "@xmath11 changes sign at superconducting transition temperature @xmath54 , rather than at the kondo temperature .",
    "the sign change of @xmath11 and its behavior near @xmath54 is associated with the shape of superconducting dos , which is reflected in qd density of states .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] ( left panel ) shows the temperature dependence of the wiedemann - franz ( wf ) law which relates thermal and electric conductance via the relation @xmath55 .",
    "the wiedemann - franz ratio @xmath56 ( left panel ) and thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath57 ( right panel ) as a function of temperature @xmath52.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0% ]   the wiedemann - franz ratio @xmath56 ( left panel ) and thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath57 ( right panel ) as a function of temperature @xmath52.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0% ]    this relation describes transport in fermi liquid bulk metals , and usually is violated in nanoscale systems . however , below the kondo temperature , the wf law is recovered , and the system has the fermi liquid ground state @xcite . in the high temperature regime , the wf law is violated as the transport is due to sequential processes leading to the suppression of the thermal transport @xcite .",
    "this picture is valid for qd coupled to normal or to ferromagnetic electrodes . in the presence of superconductivity , this law is violated even at low temperatures ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , indicating non - fermi liquid ground state of the system . however , the superconductivity in one of the electrodes alone is not enough to violate the wf law",
    ". there must be strong coulomb repulsion between electrons on the dot . in non - interacting qd ( @xmath58 ) the wf law",
    "is still obeyed at low @xmath52 .",
    "the violation of the wf law in strongly interacting qd has its origin in suppression of the andreev reflections , leading to smaller values of the linear conductance @xmath46 in comparison to non - interacting qd . at the same time",
    ", the andreev reflections do not contribute to thermal transport , thus the thermal conductance remains unchanged .",
    "this explains the violation of the wf law in strongly interacting n - qd - s system .",
    "thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath59 is a direct measure of the usefulness of the system for applications . for simple systems",
    "@xmath60 is inversely proportional to operating temperature , therefore it is convenient to plot @xmath61 .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows @xmath61 as a function of temperature .",
    "the value of @xmath61 never exceeds 1 , which indicates limited applicability of the system for thermoelectric power generators or cooling systems .",
    "note the enhancement of @xmath61 in superconducting state , which is due to the larger values of thermopower in this temperature range ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "in summary , i have studied thermal properties of strongly correlated quantum dot coupled to one normal and one superconducting electrode .",
    "the superconductivity strongly modifies thermal properties of the system .",
    "in particular is responsible for an enhancement of thermopower at temperatures close to the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "the suppression of andreev reflections , which is due to strong on - dot coulomb repulsion , leads to a violation of the wiedemann - franz relation and to non - fermi liquid ground state .",
