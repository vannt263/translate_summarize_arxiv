    "we first solve for the orientation of the plane of the ring system relative to our line of sight , and we then solve for the transmission of the rings as a function of radius from the secondary companion , given the geometry of the ring system derived in the previous step .      the primary is a star at a distance of @xmath12 parsecs , with radius @xmath13 .",

    "the rings are assumed to be azimuthally symmetric and the inclination of the ring plane as seen from the earth is @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 being face - on ) and the projected angle between the normal of the secondary companion s orbit and the normal of the ring plane is @xmath19 .",
    "the obliquity @xmath20 of the ring plane is related to these two angles by :    @xmath21    the rings are assumed to be considerably thinner than their diameter i.e. a `` thin ring '' approximation . in saturn s ring system , thicknesses from tens of metres down to an instrument resolved limit of tens of centimetres @xcite have been observed .",

    "the light curve of a _ point source _ passing behind the ring structure along an arbitrary chord is therefore symmetric in time about the point of closest approach of the projected star position to the companion .",
    "what may not be so obvious is that a thin ring system tilted at an arbitrary inclination will _ also _ produce a symmetric light curve , regardless of the chord chosen .",
    "this can be seen when one considers that a set of concentric ellipses can be transformed into a set of concentric circles by a single shear transformation whose shear axis is parallel to the chord .",
    "the light curve @xmath22 of a source with finite angular size ( i.e. the stellar disk of the primary ) behind a tilted ring system , however , is _ not _ time symmetric ( see figure [ fig : ringgeom ] ) . for each ring boundary ,",
    "the gradient of the light curve @xmath23 is dependent on both the size of the star , and angle between the local tangent of the ring edge and the direction of motion .",
    "ring structures smaller than that of the stellar diameter are smeared out by the resultant convolution with the stellar disk , resulting in a characteristic timescale defined by the time taken for the stellar disk to cross its own diameter @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath17 is the inclination of the plane of the rings to the plane of the sky .",

    "the result is then :    @xmath41    since nested rings only differ in a single scale factor centered on the origin , the loci of all perpendicular tangents lie on a straight line passing through the origin , i.e. the geometric centre of the rings .",

    "the transmitted intensity of light through a ring at radius @xmath16 with @xmath15 is :    @xmath50",
    "since we do not know if the rings are a single thin screen of particles or are optically thick , we do not correct @xmath51 for the inclination of the ring system .    the greatest uncertainty in the model fitting is the diameter of the star .",
    "we therefore express the size of the rings in units of time , converting back to linear sizes at the end of the modeling . with an assumed stellar size and relative velocity",
    ", the system can be converted back into units of length by multiplying by @xmath14 .",
    "a light curve model for a given star is produced with the diameter of the star , its relative velocity with respect to the secondary companion , the limb darkening parameter , the orientation and the radial transmission of the ring system .",
    "the complex light curve of j1407 was first discussed in @xcite , where intensity fluctuations of up to 95% were seen over a 56 day period in april and may 2007 towards this young ( @xmath5 myr ) k5 pre - main sequence star in photometry taken as part of the superwasp survey @xcite .",
    "after ruling out other simpler astrophysical explanations , @xcite concluded that the light curve was due to the transit of a giant ring system orbiting an unseen secondary companion , and that this ring system was considerably larger than the diameter of the central star .",
    "the star was simultaneously observed by three of the eight cameras in the superwasp south array , and due to its location in the corner of the field of view of these three cameras , there is a clear systematic offset of 0.3 magnitudes seen between the cameras in the standard data reduction photometry .",
    "a dedicated reprocessing of all the raw photometric data successfully removes both the systematic offsets seen in the light curves and also the much smaller amplitude stellar variability @xcite .",
    "we use the cleaned photometric data @xcite as the input for our ring fitting model .",
    "the observations over the 54 day period are not continuous but are interrupted by the diurnal cycle and cloud cover at the observing site , resulting in a completeness of 11.3% .",
    "fitting is performed in a two step process - we first constrain the orientation of the ring system using the gradients measured from the light curve ( section [ sec : gradfit ] ) , and then use these parameters to generate a model of the ring transmission as a function of radius from the secondary companion ( section [ sec : ringfit ] ) .",
    "the angular diameter of the star is @xmath52arcsec , based on a distance @xmath53 pc and radius of @xmath54 @xcite . treating a transiting ring as a semi - infinite knife edge , and assuming a point source behind the rings , the angular separation between the geometric edge of the ring shadow and the first diffraction maximum is @xmath55 , giving an angular fringe separation at @xmath56 nanoarcsec , about 1000 times smaller than the angular diameter of the star .",
    "using geometric shadows is therefore a valid approximation for the model .      for a given set of ring orientation parameters @xmath57",
    ", we can determine the radial distances of the rings from the secondary companion ( i.e. the ring radius ) at any epoch , @xmath58 , and also determine @xmath59 .",

    "together with a model of the stellar disk that includes limb darkening ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the functional form of @xmath15 , we can calculate the light curve of a ring system model for any epoch . in practice",
    ", we calculate a grid of values of @xmath16 for the track of the star behind the ring system , with a spatial resolution set by the diameter of the star .",
    "the transmission @xmath60 is calculated for all points in the grid along the track .",
    "this grid of flux values is then convolved with a model of the stellar disk , and the line of pixels along the impact parameter @xmath26 then represents the measured flux @xmath22 .",
    "we use 25 pixels across the diameter of the star to sample the limb darkening and stellar disk .",
    "the measured flux @xmath22 of j1407 can be closely approximated as a sequence of straight lines of different gradients ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "we interpret these straight line light curves as a ring edge ( between two rings with different values of transmission ) passing across the disk of the star .",
    "when the slope of the light curve changes , this represents a ring edge either starting or finishing its transit of the stellar disk .",
    "the measured gradients of straight line fits to the j1407 light curve are shown as the black circles in figure [ fig : diskfit ] .",
    "we assume that all the rings have well defined edges and have a constant transmission across the width of the ring ( with some assumed constant @xmath51 ) - see figure [ fig : edgedisk ] .        to understand our ring orientation algorithm ,",
    "consider a ring system made up of alternately transparent and opaque rings whose radial width would allow complete obscuration or transmission of the stellar disk .",
    "the transmitted intensity goes from @xmath61 to @xmath62 and vice versa at a rate determined by the ring velocity @xmath14 and the local tangent of the ring to the line of stellar motion , defined as parallel to the x - axis in our model .",
    "if the gradient of the light curve is measured close to the midpoint of the transit of a ring edge , and this quantity is plotted as a function of time , the result is the black curve in figure [ fig : diskfit ] .        defining the angle between the tangent of the ring at point @xmath63 to the x - axis as @xmath64 ( see figure [ fig : edgedisk ] ) :    @xmath65    the area swept out by a straight edge in time @xmath66 across a stellar disk with no limb darkening is equal to @xmath67 where @xmath68 . defining the transmission @xmath69 ,",

    "the function @xmath76 represents the maximum flux change possible between a fully transparent and fully opaque ring . for rings that have intermediate values of transmission",
    ", the resultant light gradients will lie underneath this black curve , and so the curve represents an upper bound on the light gradient for a given ring orientation . since we do not know @xmath15 , we can use @xmath76 as an upper limit and we search for ring orientations that have all measured gradients lie underneath this curve .",
    "we have @xmath77 measurements of the light curve gradient @xmath23 at time @xmath27 .",
    "the model gradient @xmath76 is calculated from equation [ gt ] , where @xmath64 is a function of @xmath78 .",
    "we calculate a cost function that minimises the difference between the model and measured gradients , and penalizes heavily if the measured point goes above the model point . if we define @xmath79 , then our cost function @xmath80 is :    @xmath81    the factor of 50 used in the above equation reflects the error of 2% on the measured light curve gradients , and prevents fitting algorithms from oscillating near local minima .",
    "we use an amoeba simplex algorithm @xcite to solve for the four free parameters .",
    "the resulting behaviour of the cost function is to bring down the model curve @xmath76 so that at least two measured gradient points from @xmath23 lie on @xmath76 , which may not be necessarily correct if the data is sparse and the measured slopes do not sample the largest gradient of @xmath76 at @xmath38 . in the case of j1407 ,",
    "the largest observed gradient is during mjd 54220 , and the complete set of parameters for the disk geometry is listed in table [ tab : model1 ] .",
    "it is highly probable that this is the largest gradient in the ring system since the secondary companion velocity derived from this gradient presents a challenge to the orbital dynamics for rings ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detained discussion ) .",
    "we therefore introduce an additional cost function that fixes the midpoint of the eclipse light curve @xmath38 to a user defined value , so that we can explore different ring geometries that still produce reasonable cost functions .",

    "the number of ring edges in the light curve are estimated by counting the number of slope changes identified in the light curve and indirectly implied by the change of the light curve during daylight hours .",

    "we consider if the ring system is on an unbound trajectory with a tangential velocity of at least 33 km.s@xmath107 .",
    "the may 2007 eclipse is therefore a single event that will not be repeated again with j1407 .",
    "our derived ring model is consistent with the data , yielding a diameter of 1.2 au for the ring system .",
    "we consider the unbound hypothesis as exceptionally unlikely , for two reasons :    \\(1 ) the mean projected separation between stars in the field is @xmath108 au .",
    "the probability that a 1 au scale object produces an eclipse within the lifetime of superwasp is exceptionally small .",
    "\\(2 ) j1407b is substellar and almost certainly planetary mass @xcite .",
    "the estimated size of the ring system is two orders of magnitude larger than the roche limit for the central substellar mass , and so the rings outside the roche limit are expected to accrete into satellites on timescales shorter then gigayears .",
    "this implies that the ring system is considerably younger than stars seen in the field .",
    "direct imaging limits reported in @xcite constrain such a free - floating object to be @xmath109 , assuming an age of 16 myr and bt - settl models @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the ring system is bound to j1407 in a closed orbit .      in @xcite a search for j1407b",
    "is carried out using photometry , radial velocity measurements of j1407 , direct and interferometric techniques .",
    "the companion is not detected , but upper limits from these observations constrain the possible orbital period and mass of j1407b .",
    "a circular orbit for j1407b would mean that any ring system would not be subject to gravitational peturbations due to the orbit of j1407b , and so appears preferable for ring stability .",
    "transverse velocities derived from the light curve gradients , however , strongly rule out long orbital periods , but the lack of a second primary eclipse in time - series photometry rules out short orbital periods .",
    "a circular orbit is possible if the rings are themselves clumpy in nature and the clump orbital motion vectorially adds to the j1407b orbital motion @xcite , but this again requires a series of coincidences to occur to generate a large gradient at the appropriate epochs .",
    "an elliptical orbit with the eclipse coincident with periastron passage of j1407b can provide the transverse velocity required for the ring model .",
    "constraints presented in @xcite suggest a minimum eccentricity of 0.7 and a minimum period of 10 years .",
    "the longest period is unconstrained in this model , as very highly eccentric orbits are possible with the long axis pointing towards earth , but the probability of such a precise alignment becomes increasingly unlikely .",
    "truncating the eccentricity to be between 0.7 and 0.8 gives a probable mass of 24 @xmath91 and probable period of 13.3 years .",
    "one conclusion with these eccentric orbits is that the ring system is within the hill sphere for most of its orbit , but at periastron the hill sphere shrinks down below the size of the outermost rings , providing a challenge for investigations into the stability of this ring system .",
    "we interpret the 56 day j1407 light curve event centered on ut 30 april 2007 as being due to a highly structured ring system surrounding an unseen secondary companion , supporting the conclusions in @xcite .",
    "using the gradients in the light curve generated by the finite size of the primary star , we solve for the geometry and impact parameter of the secondary companion and ring system .",
    "the size of the ring system is considerably larger than the roche radius for the secondary companion , and fills a significant fraction of the hill radius .",
    "this implies that this structure is in a transitional state , with the rings at large radii undergoing accretion to form exosatellites orbiting the secondary companion . the rapid variation in ring density as a function of radius implies dynamical clearing processes that keep material out of the ring plane .",
    "two such processes are ( i ) the formation of exomoons that are gravitationally clearing out these gaps , such as those sculpting the a - ring gaps in saturn , and ( ii ) the presence of lindbad resonances , caused by the presence of unseen exosatellites at larger radii . for a secondary companion mass of @xmath110 ,",
    "we interpret one of the most well - defined ring gaps at 61 million km with a width of 4 million km to be cleared by a satellite with an upper mass of @xmath111 .",
    "this satellite would have an orbital period of @xmath112 years in the ring system about j1407b .",
    "we estimate the mass of the individual rings by assuming a dust opacity of @xmath113 for unity optical depth , as assumed in @xcite for their estimate .",
    "the mass of each model ring is calculated without any correction for the projected inclination of the rings , and is then plotted as the open circles in figure [ fig : tfit ] .",
    "the mass of the rings is dependent on the orbital parameters of j1407b , the effective dust opacity in the rings , the detailed dust size distribution and the unknown ring structure where there is no photometric constraint . in the regions of no photometry , the ring structure",
    "is extended with the same optical properties at that at the closest known edge .",
    "the order of magnitude estimate for the total mass of the rings is @xmath114 , close to the mass of the earth .",
    "the ratio of the mass of the densest rings around saturn ( the b ring system ) to the largest satellite , titan , is approximately 1/4000 . a large fraction of the mass is therefore accreted in the satellites .",
    "it is interesting to note that the satellite in j1407b has a similar mass ( to an order of magnitude ) as the rings , implying that further accretion into satellites is ongoing . for the cases where there are significant gaps in the photometric coverage or",
    "there is a window function imposed by the diurnal cycle , degeneracies appear in the fitted exoring models .",
    "photometric data that continuously samples the eclipse light curve can completely solve the geometry of the exoring system .",
    "ring systems are thought to occur around other exoplanets , although none have been confirmed .",
    "fomalhaut b is a co - moving companion to the nearby 400 myr old star , moving on an eccentric orbit @xcite . a large ring system around the planet is thought to cause the anomalously bright flux seen in optical images .",
    "the orbit for @xmath101 pictoris b is close to edge on @xcite , indicating that it might transit its parent star .",
    "anomalous photometry of @xmath101 pictoris in 1981 @xcite has also been attributed to an extended system of material surrounding the planet , and the anomalous photometry extends over 30 days , implying that there is material extending out to @xmath115 of the hill radius of the planet .",
    "this could plausibly be caused by a giant ring system transiting @xmath101 pictoris , similar to the ring system about j1407b .    with simple assumptions on ring geometry and the ring plane orientation",
    ", this ring model reproduces many but not all of the nightly photometric light curves .",
    "these discrepancies imply either an error in the determined geometry of the ring plane , and/or the rings are not coplanar .",
    "further modeling with additional degrees of freedom for the rings , such as warping and precession may lead to better fits to the photometric data .",
    "j1407 is currently being monitored both photometrically and spectroscopically for the start of the next transit .",
    "a second transit will enable a wide range of exoring science to be carried out , from transmission spectroscopy of the material , through to doppler tomography that can resolve ring structure and stellar spot structure significantly smaller than that of the diameter of the star .",
    "the orbital period of j1407b is on the order of a decade or possibly longer .",
    "searches for other occultation events are now being carried out @xcite and searches through archival photographic plates ( e.g. dasch ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may well yield several more transiting ring system candidates .",
