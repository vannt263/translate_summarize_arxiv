    "the discovery of the quantum statistics that incorporate pauli s exclusion principle @xcite , made independently by fermi @xcite and dirac @xcite , allowed the qualitative understanding of several physical phenomena  in a wide range of values of the particle density , from astrophysical scales to sub - nuclear ones in terms of the ideal fermi gas ( ifg ) .",
    "the success of the explicative scope of the ideal fermi gas model relies on landau s fermi liquid theory where , fermions interacting repulsively through a short range forces can be described in some degree as an ifg .",
    "the situations changes dramatically in low dimensions , since fermi systems are inherently unstable towards any finite interaction @xcite , thus the ifg in low dimensions becomes an interesting solvable model to study the thermodynamics of possible singular behavior .",
    "on the other hand , the experimental realization of quantum degeneracy in trapped atomic fermi gases @xcite triggered a renewed interest , over the last fifteen years , in the study not only of interacting fermion systems @xcite but also of trapped ideal ones as well @xcite .",
    "indeed , the nearly ideal situation has been experimentally realized by taking advantage of the suppression of @xmath0-wave scattering in spin - polarized fermion gases due to pauli exclusion principle and of the negligible effects of @xmath1-wave scattering for the temperature ranges involved .",
    "further , the control achieved on the experimental settings has open the possibility to directly test a variety of quantum effects such as pauli blocking @xcite , and to design experiments to probe condensed matter models , though much lower temperatures are needed to achieve the phenomena of interest . on this trend , experimentally new techniques are being devised to cool further a cloud of atomic fermions @xcite .",
    "techniques based on the giving - away of entropy by changing the shape of the trapping potential has resulted of great importance and , as in many instances , a complete understanding of trapped non - interacting fermionic atoms would result of great value .    in distinction with the ideal bose gas ( ibg ) , which suffers the so - called bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in three dimensions ,",
    "the ifg shows a smooth thermodynamic behavior as function of the particle density and temperature , this however , does not precludes interesting behavior as has been pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it is suggested that the ifg can suffer a condensation - like process at a characteristic temperature @xmath2 .",
    "arguments based on a thermodynamic approach in support of this phenomenon are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the author suggest that the change of sign of the chemical potential , which defines the characteristic temperature @xmath3 marks the appearance of the condensed phase when the gas is cooled .",
    "truly , the significance of @xmath4 has motivated the discussion of its meaning and/or importance at different levels and contexts @xcite . for",
    "the widely discussed  textbook case , namely the three - dimensional ifg confined by a impenetrable box potential , the chemical potential results to be a monotonic decreasing function of the temperature , diminishing from the _ fermi energy _ , @xmath5 , at zero temperature , to the values of the ideal classical gas for temperatures much larger than @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath8 is the planck s constant divided by @xmath9 , @xmath10 the mass of the particle and @xmath11 is the thermal wavelength of de broglie , where @xmath12 denotes the system s absolute temperature . a clear , qualitative , physical argument of this behavior is presented by cook and dickerson in ref .",
    "@xcite . in comparison",
    ", the chemical potential of the ibg vanishes below a characteristic temperature , called the critical temperature of bec , @xmath13 and decreases monotonically for larger temperatures converging asymptotically to the values of the classical ideal gas .",
    "this picture changes dramatically as the dimensionality of the system @xmath14 , is lowered . in two dimensions the ibg shows no off - diagonal - long - range order at any finite temperature @xcite and",
    "therefore the bec transition does not occur . at this quirky dimension",
    ", the chemical potential of both , the fermi and bose ideal gases , decreases monotonically with temperature essentially in the same functional way @xcite , being different only by an additive constant , expressly , the fermi energy .",
    "this results in the same temperature dependence of their respective specific heats at constant volume @xmath15 @xcite . in general , this last outstanding feature occurs whenever the number of energy levels per energy interval is uniform as in the case of a one dimensional gas in an harmonic trap @xcite , or the case @xmath16 where @xmath0 is the exponent of the single - particle energy spectrum of the form @xmath17 @xmath1 being the particle momentum @xcite .",
    "in one dimension , the chemical potential of the ibg decreases monotonically with temperature , and as in the two dimensional case , this behavior is related to the impossibility of bec as shown by hohenberg @xcite , at finite , non - zero , temperature .",
    "in contrast , the chemical potential of the ifg exhibits a _",
    "behavior : starts rising quadratically with @xmath12 above the fermi energy instead of decreasing from it , and returns to its usual monotonic - decreasing behavior at temperatures that can be as large as twice the fermi temperature ( see fig . 1 below ,",
    "see also fig . 1 in ref .",
    "this _ unexpected _ , and not well understood behavior , can be exhibited mathematically by the sommerfeld expansion @xcite or by other methods @xcite , though no intuitive physical explanation of it , that predicts its appearance in the more general case , seems to have been given before @xcite .",
    "this forms the basis for the motivation of the present paper .    after this excursus",
    ", one may conceive dimension two as a _ crossover _ value for which the thermodynamic properties of ideal quantum gases are conspicuously distinct for @xmath18 than those for @xmath19 .",
    "this can be seen in the specific heat , which in the case of the ifg exhibits a no - bump @xmath20 bump transition as dimension is varied from 3 to 1 @xcite analogous to the well known cusp @xmath20 no - cusp transition of the ibg specific heat . in the later case , the cusp marks the bec phase transition while no physical meaning is yet given for the bump in the former case .",
    "in this paper we provide an analysis that attempts to explain the various features that are observed in the low - dimensional , trapped ifg , focusing in the nonmonotonic dependence on @xmath12 of the chemical potential . in section [ sect:2 ]",
    "the system under consideration is described , thermodynamics quantities are calculated and characteristics temperatures are introduced . in section [ sect:3 ] a heuristic explanation of the nonmonotonic dependence of the ifg chemical potential on temperature is given . in sections [ sect:4 ] and [ sect:5 ] the physical meaning of two relevant characteristic temperatures is given . finally , conclusions and final remarks conform section [ sect:6 ] .",
    "we consider an ifg of @xmath21 , conserved , spinless fermions in arbitrary dimension @xmath22 .",
    "we assume a single - particle density of states ( dos ) of the form @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the energy , @xmath25 and @xmath0 are positive constants , the former depends on @xmath14 and on the specific energy spectrum of the system , while the later is determined by the particular system dynamics .",
    "two instances lead to the power - law dependance in expression ( [ dos ] ) : the first one is based on the _ generalized energy - momentum relation _",

    "the physical cases @xmath30 correspond , respectively , to the nonrelativistic ifg with @xmath31 and to the ultrarelativistic ifg for which @xmath32 @xmath33 being the speed of light . in this case",
    "@xmath25 takes the form @xmath34,$ ] with @xmath35 the gamma function and @xmath36 the volume of the system .",
    "the second instance is based on the @xmath14-dimensional ifg trapped by an isotropic potential of the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 @xmath39 are two constants that characterize the energy and length scales of the trap .",
    "this trapping potential leads , in the semi - classical approximation @xcite , to @xmath40}{\\gamma(d/2)\\gamma[d / s]\\hbar^{d } } \\left(\\frac{mr_{0}^{2}}{2}\\right)^{d/2}u_{0}^{d(1/2 - 1/s)}$ ] with @xmath41 .",
