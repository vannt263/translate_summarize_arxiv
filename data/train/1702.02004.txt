    "these relations will be discussed in detail in a sequel paper @xcite .    with this motivation ,",
    "let us continue with our discussion of plucking polynomial .",
    "although , the definition depends on plane embedding of the rooted tree , the polynomial itself is independent of embedding @xcite , see section 2 .",
    "it is natural to ask the following two questions    1 .   for a given polynomial",
    "@xmath32 $ ] , does there exist a rooted tree @xmath0 such that @xmath33 ?",
    "2 .   when do two rooted trees have the same plucking polynomial ?    the first question was answered in @xcite , and in this paper we will focus on the second question .",
    "note that if the root of a rooted tree @xmath0 has only one child , i.e. there is only one edge incident with the root , then by contracting this edge we will obtain a new rooted tree @xmath34 .",

    "the answer is yes .",
    "+    following a seminar talk by the first author about plucking polynomial at peking university in september 2016 , hao zheng observed the following potential counterexample .",
    "later we will show that this is really a counterexample , i.e. although the two rooted trees in figure [ figure5 ] have the same plucking polynomial @xmath47_q[11]_q[12]_q[13]_q[14]_q[15]_q[16]_q[17]_q[18]_q[19]_q}{[2]_q^3[3]_q[5]_q[6]_q}$ ] , none of them can be obtained from the other via finitely many exchange moves .",
    "+    in order to address the second question mentioned above , we need to introduce a generalized exchange move , called the _",

    "+    clearly a permutation move preserves the plucking polynomial ( see proposition 2.4 ) and the exchange move described in figure [ figure4 ] is a special case of permutation move .",

    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 reviews some basic properties of plucking polynomial and then points out some other accessible calculation methods of the plucking polynomial .",
    "section 3 is devoted to show that the potential counterexample in figure [ figure5 ] is indeed a counterexample .",
    "section 4 provides a proof of the main theorem .",
    "finally we revisit the realization problem of the plucking polynomial and give an application of it , which may be of interest to experts in graph theory , algebraic combinatorics , or statistical mechanics .",

    ". then    @xmath84 .",
    "the recursive definition of the plucking polynomial stated in the beginning of section 1 is inconvenient to use to calculate the plucking polynomial . in general",
    ", one needs to pluck out the leaves of a rooted tree one by one and then calculate the plucking polynomial of the new rooted tree with fewer edges .",
    "corollary 2.2 gives us a more convenient way to calculate the plucking polynomial of rooted trees .",
    "for a rooted tree @xmath0 and a fixed vertex @xmath8 , we use the notation @xmath85 to refer to the number of descendants of @xmath8 .",
    "for example , if @xmath86 , the root of @xmath0 , then @xmath87 . denote all children of @xmath8 by @xmath88 , we associate a _ boltzmann weight _",
    "@xmath89 with @xmath8 , which is defined by    @xmath90 .",
    "note that here we have the equation @xmath91 .",
    "now we have the following state product formula of the plucking polynomial .",
    ".    it immediately follows that plucking polynomial does not depend on the embedding type . in other words , it is an invariant of rooted trees . on the other hand ,",
    "since the plucking polynomial can be written as the product of some @xmath71-multinomial coefficients and each @xmath71-multinomial coefficient can be written as the product of some @xmath71-binomial coefficients , we conclude that plucking polynomial of rooted trees can be written as the product of some @xmath71-binomial coefficients . based on this fact , in @xcite we gave a complete answer to the first question mentioned in section 1 . to address the second question , we need to simplify the calculation formula of plucking polynomial once again .",
    "let @xmath0 be a rooted tree and @xmath93 the root of it , then we have @xmath94_q!}{\\prod\\limits_{v\\in v(t)\\backslash{\\{r\\}}}[d(v)+1]_q}$ ] .",
    "according to proposition 2.3 , the plucking polynomial @xmath4 has the form @xmath95 .",

    "the result follows .",

    "the following proposition tells us that for reduced trees @xmath4 and @xmath105 are essentially equivalent .",

    "we remark that here we only mentioned some basic properties of the plucking polynomial . for some other properties , for example the unimodality of its coefficients ( see @xcite ) or the connection between the plucking polynomial and homological algebra , the readers are referred to @xcite for more details .",
    "in this section we show that the two rooted trees depicted in figure [ figure5 ] can not be connected by exchange moves , although they have the same plucking polynomial .",
    "in other words , exchange move is not sufficient to connect all pairs of rooted trees with the same plucking polynomial .",
    "first we notice that one can only obtain finitely many rooted trees from the rooted tree @xmath39 in figure [ figure5 ] via exchange moves . by comparing them with @xmath40",
    "one will find that @xmath40 is different from all of them .",
    "recall that in section 2 we associate a boltzmann weight @xmath89 with each vertex @xmath8 , which is defined by    @xmath90 .",

    "for the two rooted trees @xmath75 in figure [ figure5 ] , we have    @xmath135    and    @xmath136 .",
    "a key observation is , although many rooted trees can be obtained from @xmath39 via exchange moves , most of them have the same set @xmath137 as @xmath39 .",
    "the only exception is    @xmath138 .",
    "it follows that @xmath40 can not be obtained from @xmath39 by exchange moves .",

    "we illustrate how one rooted tree can be obtained from another by exchange moves .",
    "obviously @xmath40 is not one of them .     by exchange moves , title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "before ending this section , we would like to remark that one can find some other pairs of  smaller \" rooted trees which have the same plucking polynomial but can not be connected by exchange moves .",
    "for example , the two rooted trees @xmath139 and @xmath140 described in figure [ figure11 ] have the same plucking polynomial .",

    "these two rooted trees @xmath139 and @xmath140 can be regarded as a reduced version of hao zheng s @xmath75 described in figure [ figure5 ] .",
    "now we give a proof of theorem 1.2 .    with some destabilization ( if necessary )",
    "we may assume that @xmath142 are both reduced .",
    "by proposition 2.5 we deduce that @xmath143 .",

    "the first pair of rooted trees appear when @xmath146 , see figure [ figure7 ] .",
    "it is easy to see that the second tree can be obtained from the first tree by one exchange move , which interchanges the places of the subtrees bounded by the dashed curves .",
    "+    now we assume that any two reduced rooted trees can be transformed into each other by one permutation move if they have @xmath79 edges and the same plucking polynomial .",
    "it is sufficient to prove that the statement is still correct for the case @xmath147 .",

    "we would like to remark that we can always find a binary rooted tree @xmath0 to realize @xmath224 , and @xmath230 coincides with the state product formula ( proposition 2.3 ) of the plucking polynomial of @xmath0 if we ignore the contributions from those vertices that have only one child ( note that these contributions are trivial ) .",
    "the readers are referred to @xcite for more details .",
    "now we give the proof of theorem 5.2 .",
    "the  only if \" part has been explained in section 2 , therefore it suffices to prove theif \" part .",
    "first note that if @xmath231 then obviously @xmath223_q!}{\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}[a_i+1]_q}$ ] can not be written as a product of some @xmath71-binomial coefficients .",
    "we claim that actually we can assume that @xmath232 .",
    "this is because , if @xmath233 then we have    @xmath223_q!}{\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}[a_i+1]_q}=\\frac{[a_{n-1}]_q!}{\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{n-2}[a_i+1]_q}$ ] .    if @xmath234 can be realized as the set @xmath105 for some rooted tree",
    "@xmath0 , then we can find a rooted tress @xmath34 realizing @xmath209 by applying a stabilization on @xmath0 .",
    "hence from now on let us assume that @xmath232 .",
    "note that if @xmath223_q!}{\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}[a_i+1]_q}$ ] can be written as the product of some @xmath71-binomial coefficients @xmath230 , then the numerator of the reduced form does not repeat any @xmath71-number , since the numerator equals @xmath235_q!=[1]_q[2]_q\\cdots[a_n]_q$ ] . according to theorem 5.3",
    "we know that there exists a rooted tree @xmath0 such that @xmath236_q!}{\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}[a_i+1]_q}$ ] . with some destabilizations we can assume that @xmath0 is reduced .",
    "let us assume that @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "then we have    @xmath239_q!}{\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{m-1}[b_i+1]_q}=\\frac{[a_n]_q!}{\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}[a_i+1]_q}$ ] .    since @xmath232 and @xmath240",
    ", it follows that @xmath241 .",
    "now we have    @xmath242_q}=\\frac{1}{\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}[a_i+1]_q}$ ] ,    which implies @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
