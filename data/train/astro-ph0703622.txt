    "echelle spectrographs are the basic tool for astronomical spectroscopy with high velocity precision . since many echelle diffraction orders can be cross - dispersed and thereby recorded simultaneously on rectangular - format media [ e.g.  modern charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) ] , more - or - less continuous wavelength coverage over much of the optical range can be achieved whilst maintaining high resolving power , where @xmath6 is the instrumental profile s full - width at half - maximum . ] .",
    "most modern echelle spectrographs operate at @xmath7@xmath8 ; higher resolving powers usually entail reduced wavelength coverage .",
    "however , to fully exploit the velocity precision available in high - resolution spectra , precise wavelength calibration over much of the available wavelength range is usually required .",
    "for example , searches for extra - solar planets via the radial velocity method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have achieved night - to - night relative precisions better than @xmath9 from stellar absorption lines integrated over wavelength ranges of @xmath1@xmath10@xmath11-  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , echelle spectra of quasar absorption systems have constrained cosmological variations in fundamental constants , such as the fine - structure constant ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) and proton - to - electron mass ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent measurements of @xmath12-variation using many absorption systems reach relative precisions of @xmath1@xmath13 when comparing several transitions separated by up to @xmath1@xmath14  ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding velocity precision required is @xmath1@xmath15 .",
    "the need for even higher precision is already clear . detecting earth - mass extra - solar planets around solar - mass stars will require @xmath16@xmath17 precision stable over many - year timescales .",
    "also , current evidence for varying constants ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) remains controversial and such potentially fundamental results should be refuted or confirmed with the highest possible confidence .",
    "there is even the possibility of measuring the acceleration of the universal expansion by monitoring the change in redshift of lyman-@xmath12 forest absorption lines in quasar spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this would require two epochs of spectra , taken decades apart , with velocity precision approaching @xmath2 integrated over @xmath1@xmath10@xmath11  ranges .",
    "this is one possible aim of the cosmic dynamics experiment ( codex ) spectrograph proposed for the european extremely large telescope ( @xcite ; @xcite ; liske et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "astronomical echelle spectra are usually wavelength calibrated using comparison emission- or absorption - line spectra .",
    "the ideal comparison spectrum would comprise a series of lines which : ( i ) have known wavelengths which are determined by fundamental physics ; ( ii ) are individually unresolved ; ( iii ) are resolved from each other ; ( iv ) have uniform spacing ; ( v ) cover the entire optical wavelength range ; ( vi ) have uniform strength ( intensity or optical depth ) ; ( vii ) are stable over long time - scales and ( viii ) do not reduce the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath18 ) of the object spectrum .",
    "the calibration source should also be : ( ix ) exchangeable , in the sense that two independent sources produce the same spectrum ; ( x ) easy to use , i.e.  essentially ` turn - key ' operation for non - expert users and ( xi ) should have a reasonably low cost .",
    "table [ tab : req ] summarises whether four different calibration sources meet these requirements .",
    "the most commonly used calibration source is the thorium - argon ( thar ) hollow - cathode emission - line lamp .",
    "while it is relatively low cost , has lines whose wavelengths are determined by atomic physics and which cover the entire optical wavelength range , it has several disadvantages .",
    "for example , thar lines differ widely in intensity and spacing .",
    "indeed , most are blended together at @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , as the current and pressure in the lamp varies ( e.g.  as the lamp ages ) the relative intensity of different thar lines varies widely .",
    "iodine cells are also commonly used in radial - velocity extra - solar planet searches ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these have similar advantages and disadvantages as thar lamps but they are typically only useful over the wavelength range @xmath14@xmath20and absorb about half the object light , thereby significantly reducing the @xmath18 .",

    "poss . ' means possible depending on the design and construction of the calibration source . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a significant step towards the ideal calibration source might be achieved with the relatively new technology of optical ` frequency combs ' generated from mode - locked femtosecond - pulsed lasers .",
    "the 2005 nobel prize in physics was awarded for the pioneering work on such combs ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as the name suggests , a frequency comb provides a spectrum of continuous - wave laser lines called modes .",
    "they are produced by the repetitive pulse train of the mode - locked laser .",
    "the mode spacing , which is constant in frequency space , is given by the pulse repetition frequency .",
    "since it resides in the radio frequency domain it can readily be synchronised with an extremely precise frequency reference such as an atomic clock .",
    "the comb s perfectly regular frequency grid should also facilitate the effective compensation of non - linearities in the spectrograph s calibration curve while directly linking the calibration to the fundamental physics of the atomic clock .",
    "this direct link to the definition of time and the long - term stability mean that even if different combs are used to calibrate spectra taken at ( perhaps widely ) different epochs , those spectra can be directly compared .",
    "research utilising archival and ` virtual observatory ' data would directly benefit from such a reproducible calibration source .",
    "these properties would greatly facilitate extra - solar planet detection and varying - constant analyses and would be more - or - less required for detecting the universal acceleration via lyman-@xmath12 forest spectra taken decades apart .",
    "this paper describes further the possibility of frequency comb calibration of echelle spectrographs .",
    "section [ sec : op ] outlines the basics of frequency comb generation , the methods used to ensure that they are stable and the general manner in which they might be used as practical echelle calibration sources .",
    "section [ sec : phot ] derives the optimal laser repetition frequency and the overall precision of the wavelength calibration that might be achieved with typical echelle spectrographs .",
    "some likely sources of systematic errors which may otherwise limit the precision are also discussed .",
    "section [ sec : prob ] outlines the main challenges in designing a working frequency comb calibration system and proposes some possible solutions .",
    "the exact properties of a frequency comb may be derived even without knowledge of the operational principles of a mode - locked laser .",
    "it suffices to know that these lasers can store a single pulse and maintain it on a repetitive path .",
    "after each round - trip a copy of this pulse is emitted though the output mirror / coupler of the laser , resulting in an indefinite train of laser pulses . like in any other laser , the energy lost is replenished by stimulated emission in the lasing medium , thereby allowing the energy in a short pulse to be stored for any length of time by compensation of loss with gain .    to understand the mode structure of a femtosecond frequency comb and the techniques employed to stabilize it , consider the idealized case of a pulse circulating as a carrier wave with frequency @xmath22 in a laser cavity with length @xmath23 .",
    "the cavity strongly modulates the carrier wave amplitude which can therefore be described by a periodic envelope function @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the round - trip travel time of the pulse calculated from the cavity mean group velocity : @xmath26 .",
    "the repetition rate of the laser is simply @xmath27 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] .",
    "since the envelope function is periodic it can be written as a fourier series and the electric field at any given place ( e.g.  the laser s output mirror / coupler ) can therefore be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath30th fourier component of @xmath31 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : fourier ] ) shows that , under the assumption of a periodic pulse envelope , the resulting spectrum is a comb of laser frequencies with spacing @xmath32 such that the @xmath30th frequency component is @xmath33 . in general ,",
    "@xmath22 is not an integer multiple of @xmath32 and so the modes are shifted from being exact harmonics of @xmath32 .",
    "re - numbering the modes gives @xmath34 for @xmath35 a large integer , where the carrier envelope offset frequency , @xmath36 , is restricted to @xmath37 .",
    "this equation maps two radio frequencies , @xmath32 and @xmath36  which can be stabilized by a precise reference such as an atomic clock  onto the optical frequencies @xmath38 .    , exactly .",
    "dispersive elements in the laser cause a difference in the group and phase velocity , continuously shifting the carrier wave with respect to the envelope in the upper trace by @xmath39 per pulse . in the frequency domain",
    "this causes the comb to shift by an amount @xmath40 . ]",
    "given the simple treatment above , one might expect deviations from equation ( [ eq : fopt ] ) in reality .",
    "however , mode locking the laser ensures that equation ( [ eq : fopt ] ) is realised to very high precision in practice .",
    "the frequencies @xmath38 in equation ( [ eq : fopt ] ) represent the longitudinal cavity modes of the mode - locked laser .",
    "the process of mode locking stabilizes the mode frequency difference , @xmath32 , and the cavity mode phases such that their superposition yields a short pulse .",
    "the existence of such a pulse depends on the stability of the relative phases of the modes : if these change in time  for example , due to a small deviation of the mutual mode separation from @xmath32  the pulse would disintegrate immediately .",
    "the very observation that the pulse stays intact for a time @xmath41 implies that variations in @xmath32 must be @xmath42 . for a pulse life - time of @xmath43 , this is only a few parts in @xmath44 at the optical frequencies @xmath38 .",
    "of course , the stored pulse lasts much longer than @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , deviations from equation ( [ eq : fopt ] )  that is , deviations from a constant mode spacing  have so far evaded detection even at the @xmath1@xmath45 level @xcite .",
    "as the pulse circulates in the cavity , dispersion causes a difference between the group and phase velocities .",
    "the pulse envelope , @xmath31 , propagates at the group velocity , @xmath46 , while the carrier wave travels at its phase velocity , causing them to shift with respect to each other after each pulse round - trip .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] . comparing two consecutive pulses with @xmath24 , equation ( [ eq : fourier ] ) implies that the electric field is given by @xmath47 where , in the last step , a large integer multiple of @xmath48 was subtracted from the phase , equation ( [ eq : fopt ] ) was used with @xmath22 as one of the modes and we recall that @xmath49 .",
    "that is , the phase shift for each pulse round - trip is @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the frequency comb is offset from being exact integer harmonics of @xmath32 by the so - called carrier - envelope offset frequency , @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasised that the _ model _ for the origin of @xmath36 is not important for precision measurements using the comb ; all that is required is that @xmath36 can be fixed to a certain value experimentally ( e.g.  via a feedback loop ) and that the mode spacing , @xmath32 , is constant .    as fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] illustrates , the spectral envelope of the frequency comb has a width that is _ roughly _ given by the inverse of the pulse duration and a mode spacing given _ exactly _ by the inverse round - trip time , @xmath52 .",
    "modern mode - locked lasers readily achieve @xmath1@xmath53-wide spectra ( @xmath54@xmath55  wide at @xmath14 ) from @xmath1@xmath56 pulses .",
    "two types of lasers are common : the titanium  sapphire kerr - lens mode - locked laser which operates around @xmath57  and the erbium- and ytterbium - doped fibre lasers which operate at around @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "typical values for the mode spacing / repetition frequency are @xmath60 , but in some special cases up to @xmath61@xmath62 has been achieved .",
    "see further discussion in section [ sec : prob ] .",
    ", that displaces the modes from being exact harmonics of the repetition rate , @xmath32 , is measured by frequency doubling some modes at the ` red ' side of the comb and beating them against modes at the ` blue ' side ( depending on the type of laser , these do not need to be truly blue or red ) .",
    "_ bottom _ : such a self referencing scheme employs a dichroic mirror to separate the ` red ' and ` blue ' wings of the frequency comb .",
    "the former is frequency - doubled in a non - linear crystal and reunited with the ` blue ' part to create a wealth of beat - frequencies , all at @xmath36 . ]",
    "measuring and/or stabilizing both radio frequencies , @xmath36 and @xmath32 , fixes the entire optical frequency comb by virtue of equation ( [ eq : fopt ] ) .",
    "while the pulse repetition rate , @xmath32 , is readily measured with a photo - detector somewhere in the beam , the determination of @xmath36 requires significant effort .",
    "in fact it took more than 20 years to develop a simple @xmath36 detection scheme , dubbed ` self - referencing ' , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : freqcomb ] .",
    "a low frequency mode with mode number @xmath63 is frequency - doubled to frequency @xmath64 .",
    "this is superimposed with a high frequency mode , @xmath65 , onto a photo - detector .",
    "the resulting beat - frequency is therefore @xmath66 which reduces to the desired signal , @xmath36 , provided that @xmath67 .",
    "this latter condition requires the comb to span an entire optical octave .",
    "lasers capable of producing such broad spectra are only now becoming available ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) ; they are currently experimental and have several disadvantages .",
    "the standard method of producing this spectral width has therefore been via a process called self - phase modulation induced by non - linear interactions in optical fibres . for practical pulse repetition rates in the radio frequency domain , especially those approaching the @xmath68 regime ,",
    "the required peak intensity for such non - linear processes is difficult to achieve because the available laser power is shared by more pulses .",
    "however , with the development of kerr - lens mode - locked lasers and photonic crystal fibres ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , octave - spanning combs can now be simply generated .",
    "the fibre lasers mentioned above use specially doped fibres to achieve similar spectral broadening .",
    "self - referencing applies the full accuracy of the radio frequency reference to the entire optical comb , yielding a perfectly regular calibration grid for the spectrograph .",
    "current commercial caesium atomic clocks would provide a calibration as precise as several parts in @xmath69 , i.e.  a velocity precision of @xmath1@xmath70 .",
    "this may even be improved by using a timing signal broadcasted by the global positioning system to further stabilize the caesium clock or by setting up a local caesium fountain clock ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , we demonstrate in section [ sec : phot ] that typical echelle spectrographs will limit the available precision to @xmath1@xmath2 and so such improvements should not be necessary .",
    "in contrast to this standard radio - frequency self - referencing , an alternative optical referencing scheme might prove more practical for astronomical applications .",
    "in such a scheme the @xmath35th optical mode , @xmath38 , could be stabilized , for example , to an iodine - stabilized laser .",
    "the repetition rate would be stabilized to a precise radio frequency reference just as in the standard scheme above .",
    "as iodine - stabilized lasers can be as accurate as a few parts in @xmath69 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this method could also provide the required accuracy .",
    "figure [ fig : freqcomb ] shows the self - referenced ( i.e.  frequency calibrated ) comb spectrum being fed into the echelle spectrograph via an optical fibre .",
    "we envisage that such a configuration would offer the greatest stability and potential for tracking real - time distortions of the spectrograph wavelength scale . in practice",
    ", the spectrograph would be fed by two fibres , one carrying the science object light and the other carrying the comb light for calibration .",
    "the two spectra would be recorded simultaneously next to each other on the ccd .",
    "the intensity of the frequency comb spectrum might be varied according to changes in the intensity of object light being transmitted by the telescope and spectrograph .",
    "such variations could easily be tracked via feedback from detection of stray object light as the main beam passes into the spectrograph .",
    "thus , changes in the weather conditions or small drifts in the spectrograph itself during the object exposure , which might ordinarily lead to distortions of the wavelength scale , would affect the recorded comb spectrum in the same way .    of course , for very high precision work , one would have to consider other instrumental effects , such as differences between ( and inhomogeneities in ) the object and comb beam profiles as they emerge from the fibres .",
    "one would also consider placing the entire spectrograph in vacuum to ensure temperature and pressure stability .",
    "many of the above techniques have already been demonstrated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "of course , the more traditional approach of taking calibration exposures before and/or after the object exposure would still be open with the comb as a calibration source . the comb light could also be expanded and diffused after emerging from the fibre to illuminate a traditional spectrograph slit .",
    "note that the specifics of a final frequency comb design and spectrograph feed system need careful consideration quite beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "indeed , these design considerations first require knowledge of the optimal laser repetition rate for typical echelle resolutions .",
    "the various tolerances involved in the design should also be informed by the photon - limited calibration precision achievable with an echelle spectrograph .",
    "these quantities are calculated in section [ sec : phot ] and their implications for design challenges are considered in section [ sec : prob ] .",
    "the wavelength calibration precision available from a comb spectrum will clearly improve with increasing line - density .",
    "however , since the spectrograph resolving power is finite , too high a line - density will decrease the contrast between neighbouring lines and degrade the available precision ; an optimal line - spacing must exist . here",
    "we calculate this optimum laser repetition rate and the associated wavelength calibration precision .",
    "we first present a simple estimate of the photon - limited precision using some general arguments in section [ ssec : approx ] .",
    "sections [ ssec : info ] & [ ssec : res ] describe more rigorous calculations which also provide the optimal laser repetition rate .",
    "these calculations concentrate only on the photon - limited precision and ignore systematic errors ; the latter are discussed briefly in section [ ssec : err ] . we assume throughout this section that only one ccd exposure of the comb spectrum is used for wavelength calibrating the spectrograph .",
    "the dynamic range of the ccd pixels therefore limits the comb @xmath18 .",
    "clearly , future improvements in detector technology , such as multiple or continuous reading out of the comb spectrum during a single science exposure , could improve the effective comb @xmath18 , thereby allowing even more precise calibration .",
    "some general arguments serve as an intuitive introduction to the calculations in the following sections .",
    "let us first consider a single unresolved comb line .",
    "when extracted from the ccd , this line will reflect the instrumental profile of the spectrograph . assuming this to be a gaussian whose fwhm is sampled by @xmath71 pixels , a well - known approximation to the error on the line s position is ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath72 the @xmath18 here refers to the peak @xmath18 per pixel across the line ( i.e.  usually at the line centre ) .",
    "the pre - factor , @xmath73 , depends on both the functional form of the line - profile and the relationship between @xmath18 and pixel intensity .",
    "for example , if the noise level is constant across the profile then @xmath74 for a gaussian and @xmath75 for a lorentzian @xcite . in our case",
    "the noise is poissonian with an additional small contribution from detector noise . from a simple numerical experiment in which gaussian profiles with this noise profile were fitted with standard least - squares techniques",
    ", we find that @xmath76 when the photon noise dominates the detector noise .    to determine the total velocity precision available from , say , an entire echelle order containing such comb lines we must know the line density and the spectral width of the order .",
    "as a first guess , let us assume that a comb line occurs every 2.5 resolution elements so that the line - density is high but neighbouring lines do not strongly overlap . for consistency with the more rigorous calculations below , let us assume that echelle orders are 2048 pixels long with 3-pixel sampling of the fwhm .",
    "that is , there are @xmath77 comb lines per echelle order .",
    "therefore , assuming a peak @xmath78 in each line , the total calibration precision per echelle order at @xmath79 ( i.e.  @xmath80 ) is @xmath81 .",
    "the following sections demonstrate that our assumption that comb lines should be spaced by @xmath12.5 resolution elements does in fact provide an optimal calibration with precision close to @xmath82 per echelle order as predicted above .",

    "we construct a simple model of a frequency comb spectrum by writing the flux in each pixel , measured in photo - electrons , as the product of a slowly varying ` envelope function ' @xmath93 and a quickly varying ` comb function ' @xmath94 which varies between zero and unity : @xmath95 .",

    "the typical photon - limited precision of @xmath1@xmath2 calculated above is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the typical pixel size for most modern echelle spectrographs . to provide some context , for a 15-@xmath140 m pixel",
    "this corresponds approximately to the size of the silicon atoms making up the ccd substrate !",
    "therefore , if the photon noise limit is to be reached , mitigation of possible systematic effects in the telescope , spectrograph and detector systems is imperative .",
    "many such effects have already been considered for observations requiring short - term stability ( @xmath1@xmath141 night to @xmath1@xmath141 week ) which achieve @xmath142-  precision or better ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , in pushing to the @xmath141-precision level , additional sources of error will need to be considered in detail .",
    "we will not conduct an exhaustive study of possible effects here but the following initial list is illustrative : ( i ) inhomogeneities and variations in the intensity profile of the object and comb fibres presented at the spectrograph slit ; ( ii ) variations in the spectrograph s instrumental profile ( ip ) across the ccd ; ( iii ) inaccuracies in the echelle grating s line markings ; ( iv ) variations in pixel size and separation across an individual ccd array ; ( v ) intra - pixel sensitivity variations ; and ( vi ) ccd temperature variations , especially during read - out .",
    "while pre - slit effects such as ( i ) clearly require their own solutions ( in this case , efficient beam homogenization and stabilization ) , most post - slit effects such as ( ii  vi ) might be mitigated by using the frequency comb itself . since the comb provides a series of closely spaced modes which are known , _ a priori _ , to have equidistant spacing , comb spectra",
    "could be used to accurately characterize the spectrograph and detector s response to different systematic effects . in practice",
    ", this would be facilitated by injecting the comb spectrum into the object fibre and by altering @xmath32 and/or @xmath36 slightly to shift the comb spectrum by less than a resolution element .",
    "thus , while the frequency comb would provide , in principle , a significant increase in precision , it would also provide an important means to characterize , measure and correct - for many systematic errors so that the available photon - limited precision could be realised in practice .    aside from the spectrograph s ip , an additional factor contributing to asymmetries and variations in the measured point - spread function ( psf ) could be intrinsic asymmetries in the comb modes themselves . although the central frequencies of the modes are defined precisely by the self - referencing system , asymmetries in the modes profiles could arise via correlated phase and amplitude noise , generally referred to as ` repetition - rate noise ' . the time - dependence ( and therefore the time - averaging properties ) of the asymmetry in individual modes",
    "will depend greatly on the type of laser comb system eventually employed .",
    "nevertheless , since the spectral width of individual modes is typically @xmath11mhz ( 0.6  at 6000 ) and the asymmetry is expected to be small in comb systems stabilized to precise clocks , the difference between an individual mode s frequency and the centroid of its intrinsic profile should amount to no more than @xmath1110 . if the asymmetries vary very slowly with time , this effect would be corrected for when modelling the overall psf",
    ". however , if mode profiles were found to vary on very short time - scales , additional techniques for reducing the mode line - width closer to the desired calibration uncertainty ( i.e.  @xmath11  or 17khz at 6000 ) might be employed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "from the point of view of designing a real frequency comb calibration system , the most important result from the simulations in section [ ssec : res ] is that laser repetition rates of @xmath143@xmath144 give the highest velocity precision for practical spectrograph resolving powers of @xmath145@xmath146 [ equation ( [ eq : rep ] ) ] .",
    "although high repetition rate ( @xmath147 ) lasers with picosecond pulses and frequency combs with broad spectral coverage , sub-100-fs pulses and low repetition rate ( @xmath148 ) have been demonstrated , the desired combination of high repetition rates , short pulses and large spectral widths ( e.g.  @xmath138008200 ) is challenging and is yet to be experimentally demonstrated .",
    "a uniform intensity distribution across the whole wavelength range is also highly desirable since this ensures that similar velocity precision can be obtained from any spectral sub - division .",
    "below we discuss why these design requirements may be problematic and offer some possible solutions .      reaching the optimum repetition rate suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig : sv_vs_dnu ] is not , by itself , challenging ; several systems with even higher @xmath32 already exist .",
    "for example , @xcite published a mode - locked laser with @xmath149 .",
    "unfortunately , the peak power of such lasers is so low that they can not use the fast but weak pulse shaping and shortening mechanisms that are usually provided by the kerr effect .",
    "instead these lasers rely on slow saturable absorbers for mode locking , forcing pulse durations into the picosecond regime with the associated narrow spectral widths . indeed , the spectral width would need to be @xmath15030 times larger to maintain the comb s coherence in the spectral broadening process discussed below in section [ ssec : band ] .",
    "the challenge of generating sub-100fs pulses at repetition rates @xmath15010ghz is illustrated by a review of the performance of ultra - fast lasers in the literature , as summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : lasers ] . to our knowledge ,",
    "the highest repetition rate achieved so far in the sub-100-fs regime is @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "one possible way to combine high repetition rate , short pulses and large spectral width is to spectrally filter the laser beam outside the cavity .",
    "the strategy would be to use a laser with modest repetition rate , say @xmath152 , where reasonably short pulses can still be generated and where there is still enough energy per pulse to allow efficient spectral broadening ( as discussed in section [ ssec : band ] ) . the effective mode spacing",
    "could then be increased by filtering out most modes with a fabry - perot etalon with a free spectral range chosen to be an integer multiple of @xmath32 and equal to the final desired mode spacing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the etalon would be required to have highly stable transmission fringes and a high enough finesse to ensure strong suppression of the extraneous modes .    , measured at the position of the strongest off - resonant mode .",
    "achieving strong side - mode suppression requires a high finesse according to equation ( [ eq : finesse ] ) . ]",
    "figure [ fig : filter ] shows an etalon transmission function defined by the free spectral range ( fsr ) , mode suppression ratio in decibels ( @xmath153 ) and by a repetition rate enhancement factor @xmath154 . since the cavity transmission profile should be adequately described by an airy function , the required finesse of the etalon cavity is uniquely determined by @xmath153 and @xmath155 : @xmath156 where the approximation is accurate for suppression ratios @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "for example , the approximation is correct within 1.6 per cent for @xmath159 and @xmath160 . for a 10-ghz fsr",
    ", a side - mode suppression of @xmath159 can be achieved by eliminating 3 out of every 4 modes ( i.e.  @xmath161 ) from a @xmath162 comb , requiring a finesse of @xmath163 .",
    "such a repetition rate and finesse are achievable with current technology and so this mode - filter technique seems a promising approach to achieve higher effective repetition rates",
    ". however , one challenge will be for a large spectral range to be filtered in this way because the dispersion of the cavity components will create differing path - lengths for light of widely different wavelengths .",
    "the etalon mode - spacing remains constant only if the dispersion is compensated properly . simultaneously achieving reliable dispersion compensation and high",
    "finesse / reflectivity may impose a challenge for the etalon mirror design @xcite .",
    "a practical solution might employ several frequency combs and etalons which each cover a narrower spectral range .      in most octave - spanning frequency combs ,",
    "the process of self - phase modulation is used to extend the comb s spectral width .",
    "for example , titanium  sapphire femtosecond laser pulses launched into photonic crystal fibres or micro - structured fibres have shown extensive spectral broadening and this has been used for generating frequency combs with @xmath32 up to 1ghz ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this process",
    "the spectral coverage is increased fairly symmetrically around the central wavelength of the pulses and a total spectral coverage from @xmath139  to @xmath164 has been achieved .",
    "similarly , lasers based on er - doped fibres emitting around @xmath165 have produced spectra covering 5000  to @xmath166 at @xmath32 up to 250 mhz ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , producing broad spectra at higher repetition rates is difficult because the self - phase modulation process requires a certain pulse peak power to provide an octave of broadening . assuming a pulse train at @xmath32 with an average power , @xmath167 , the peak power is roughly given by the energy in one pulse , @xmath168 , divided by the pulse duration",
    "typically , a pulse energy of 2nj for 100-fs pulses is needed , translating to average powers of 2 & 20w for 1 & 10ghz repetition rates , respectively . in practice , @xmath167 in mode - locked lasers have so far been limited to @xmath1@xmath169 .",
    "thus , the highest repetition rates achieved so far for octave - spanning combs are around @xmath170 . the fact that sufficient self - phase modulation requires a certain pulse peak power means that , in practice , broad spectra can be produced only with relatively low @xmath32 while achieving higher @xmath32 reduces the peak pulse power below that required for sufficient broadening . for example ,",
    "the repetition rate of 4ghz demonstrated by @xcite is already close to optimal for very high spectrograph resolutions @xmath171 [ equation ( [ eq : rep ] ) ] . with a modest effort to filter the modes with an etalon , the effective repetition rate",
    "could probably be increased to @xmath150@xmath172 . however",
    ", this laser emits between @xmath173 and @xmath174 so significant non - linear conversion processes would be required , such as frequency doubling ( or tripling ) , or spectral shifting and broadening ; the pulse peak power is too low at such high repetition rates for these processes to be effective .    on the other hand ,",
    "a new class of mode - locked lasers , optimized for larger spectral width rather than shorter pulses , is currently under development .",
    "such systems have reached spectral widths extending from @xmath175  to @xmath176 @xcite at repetition rates up to @xmath177 . however , even these broad spectra are not yet sufficient to cover the entire optical region , especially the blue region of the spectrum .",
    "the current limitation is actually due to the laser cavity mirrors which do not operate efficiently outside this ( already relatively broad ) range .",
    "another option to achieve the desired effective spectral width could be the use of very fast and efficient optical phase modulators .",
    "these so - called ` optical frequency comb generators ' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are capable of adding several hundred modulation side - bands to the spectrum of a single - mode laser with separations at the required optimal mode spacing ( i.e.  @xmath110ghz ) . however , so far the spectral width of these comb generators is insufficient for covering the whole optical range",
    ". therefore , dozens ( even hundreds ) of generators would have to be used simultaneously or some advanced scanning method would have to be devised which allowed the full calibration region to be swept with a single generator ( or perhaps many ) within the exposure time .    in summary ,",
    "designing a frequency comb covering the entire optical range while maintaining a high repetition rate would require some improvements in comb technology .",
    "a practical solution might employ a combination of mode filtering stages and nonlinear conversion stages , possibly with additional amplifier stages to keep the power sufficiently high .      unlike the sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] , real frequency combs display strong intensity structure ; intensity variations of 2 orders of magnitude are to be expected , even over relatively short wavelength ranges ( @xmath1@xmath178 ) , especially when using photonic crystal fibres for spectral broadening ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the intensity structure is also sensitive to the polarization and peak power of the pulses coupled into the non - linear fibre .",
    "they therefore vary with time as the laser  fibre coupling and laser parameters change . fortunately ,",
    "since only a small amount of power is required to fully expose the ccd ( amounting to @xmath1@xmath113 photons per ccd pixel over @xmath1103600-s exposure times ) , the spectrum can be flattened by an attenuation mechanism which can respond to both spectral and time variations .",
    "one such mechanism , for example , might be a spatial light modulator ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whereby groups of modes ( i.e.  small chunks of the comb spectrum ) can be separated , differentially attenuated and recombined again .",
    "an alternative approach is to improve the matching of phase velocities ( ` phase matching ' ) between the various modes in the non - linear broadening process .",
    "this can be achieved by tailoring the longitudinal dispersion properties of the fibre and has been shown both theoretically and experimentally to produce broad , flat spectra @xcite .",
    "we have outlined the possible use of frequency combs as calibration sources in astronomical echelle spectroscopy .",
    "such combs generate a series of equally spaced , very narrow modes which , by employing self - referencing ( or possibly other calibration ) techniques , have absolute frequencies which are known _ a priori _ to relative precisions better than @xmath0 .",
    "these are significant advantages compared to the properties of other calibration sources such as thar emission - line lamps and i@xmath105 absorption cells .",
    "simulations of comb spectra with uniform intensity over the optical range were sampled according to the properties of typical high resolution echelle spectrographs and ccd detectors .",
    "these revealed that the laser repetition rate must be @xmath179@xmath180 to produce optimal line - spacings for @xmath181@xmath182 spectrographs .",
    "for such systems , the photon - limited wavelength calibration precision is in the  regime when integrated over @xmath1@xmath10  ranges and is generally @xmath1610  when integrated over individual echelle orders .",
    "the regular grid of comb lines would also greatly facilitate the tracking and effective removal of systematic distortions of the wavelength scale which might be produced through a variety of different effects in the telescope , spectrograph and detector systems .",
    "the absolute wavelength calibration would therefore be stable over very long time - scales even if elements of the spectrograph or comb changed .",
    "indeed , frequency comb calibration would place spectra observed on different telescopes at different times on the same absolute , high - precision wavelength scale .",
    "however , the results of the simulations reveal several challenges in designing and implementing a working comb calibration system .",
    "firstly , stable self - referenced combs with repetition rates of @xmath183@xmath180 and which cover the entire optical range have not yet been realised .",
    "another significant challenge will be to ensure that the comb envelope function ",
    "the peak intensity of the comb lines  is uniform over the wavelength range of interest .",
    "nevertheless , frequency comb technology is improving at a rapid pace and we expect that these challenges might be overcome by a relatively small research and development effort .",
    "the potential gain is clear : frequency comb calibration may effectively remove wavelength calibration uncertainties from all practical high - resolution spectroscopy and may allow the reliable combination of data taken on different telescopes over many decades .",
