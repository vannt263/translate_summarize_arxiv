    "the satellite and ground based imaging atmospheric cerenkov telescopes such as h.e.s.s . , magic , and veritas have demonstrated that the ultra - high energy universe is teeming with energetic very high - energy gamma - ray ( vhegr , @xmath3 ) sources , the extragalactic component of which mainly consists of tev blazars with a minority population of other sources such as radio galaxies and starburst galaxies .",

    "while these objects have an interesting phenomenology , they are believed to have a minor impact upon the universe at large , i.e. , on the formation of structures and thermodynamics .",
    "energetically this is not an unreasonable assumption , as vhegr emission is @xmath4% of the radiative power of quasars .",
    "however , in this series of papers , we show that in spite of their energetic disadvantage , tev blazars have a significant effect on structure formation and a dominant effect on thermodynamics  that is the vhegr emission from blazars `` punches '' far above its energetic weight .",
    "if _ the radiation from vhegr sources is thermalized , as we have argued is the case in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , the heating due to these vhegrs dominates photoionization heating throughout the vast majority of the universe at @xmath5 , raising the temperature of the low - density igm by up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "given that the total power emitted by agns and stars in the uv and x - rays vastly exceeds that due to the tev blazars , it seems counterintuitive that blazar heating dominates photoheating .",
    "however , the uv and x - ray background heats the intergalactic medium ( igm ) inefficiently after reionization , while vhegr photons heats the igm efficiently via plasma beam instabilities ( paper i ) .",
    "this difference in the heating efficiency of photoheating vs. blazar heating is due to the difference in the rate - limiting process in each .",
    "the rate of photoheating after reionization is not limited by the availability of ionizing photons , but instead by abundance of targets , and thus recombination .",
    "on the other hand , the heating of the igm by tev blazars does not suffer from a deficit of targets and is only limited by the total cosmic power of vhegr sources .",
    "we illustrate this point with the following order of magnitude estimate .",
    "first let us estimate the amount of photoheating that the igm suffers at the present day .",
    "the recombination rate of h is of order the hubble time at the mean density of the universe at present .",
    "hence , an average h atom in the igm will recombine once over a hubble time only to be ionized immediately by a uv photon .",
    "using a spectral index of -1.6 for the ionizing background , which is appropriate for quasars @xcite , the average amount of excess energy absorbed per ionization is @xmath6 .",
    "the fraction of the rest mass energy of all the baryons in the universe required to produce this amount of heating in the igm is @xmath7 hence , only a small amount of rest mass energy is injected as thermal energy into the igm .",
    "an equivalent statement is that the diffuse igm is optically thin to ionization radiation .    by comparison ,",
    "the fraction of the baryon rest mass locked up in massive black holes in the universe is @xmath8 and in stars is @xmath9 @xcite . assuming a radiative efficiency ( relative to rest mass ) for black holes and stars of @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , we find that fraction of the baryon rest mass converted to radiation in black holes and stars is @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "this is many orders of magnitude larger than what is required by equation ( [ eq : excess ] ) and demonstrates an important point : _ hard ionizing radiation is inefficient at heating the igm after h and he reionization . _    in paper",
    "i , we argued that vhegr photons are efficiently converted into heat in the igm via plasma instabilities .",
    "hence , the limiting factor is the total energy density of vhegr photons over cosmic time . to estimate this energy density",
    ", we note that the local _ observed _ tev blazar luminosity density is @xmath14 that of the local quasar luminosity density ( see section [ sec : z=0 heating ] ) , after correcting for various selection effects . assuming that the tev blazar luminosity density tracks the quasar luminosity density over cosmic time , this implies that the fraction of baryon rest mass that is converted to vhegr photons ( and ultimately heating of the igm ) is @xmath15 which is nearly five times that due to photoheating ( i.e. , equation ( [ eq : excess ] ) ) and demonstrates the dominance of tev blazar heating .",
    "equivalently , the greater efficiency of tev blazar heating compared to photoheating more than makes up for its energetic disadvantage .",
    "the physics of this heating and its cosmological consequences is the subject of this series of three papers . in paper",
    "i , we studied the physics of vhegr photon propagation through the universe .",
    "as these vhegrs propagate through the universe , they interact with the soft photons that comprise the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) and produce ultra - relativistic pairs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typical mean free paths are between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , depending upon the energy of the vhegr and redshift , i.e. , the universe is optically thick to vhegr .",
    "the result is a ubiquitous population of ultra - relativistic pairs , with typical lorentz factors of @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "previously , it has been assumed that they lose energy exclusively through inverse - compton scattering the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and ebl , producing gev gamma rays that form part of the egrb ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the non - observation of this gev gamma - rays has been used to argue for cosmologically interesting igmfs @xcite .",
    "we then presented a plausible alternative mechanism for extracting the kinetic energy of the ultra - relativistic pairs : plasma beam instabilities . despite the extraordinarily dilute nature of this ultra - relativistic pair plasma",
    ", we found a variety of plasma instabilities which grow on timescales short in comparison to the inverse - compton cooling time , the most important of which is the `` oblique '' instability @xcite . via this instability , these ultra - relativistic pairs lose their kinetic energy by depositing it as heat in the igm . because these beams then cool well before an inverse - compton cascade ( icc ) can develop , the simplest versions of the argument used to produce limits upon the igmf are precluded .",
    "hence , the existence of the igmf does not follow from the non - observation of gev gamma rays from existing tev blazars as previous groups have argued .",
    "in addition , the lack of an icc allows for a large and evolving blazar population without upsetting the limits on the egrb and statistics of high - energy blazars .    based upon the plasma - instability mechanism , we now adopt as a hypothesis that the ultra - relativistic pairs primarily deposit their energy in the igm via this or a related mechanism . in this paper ( paper ii )",
    ", we explore the impact of this heating on the thermodynamics of the igm .",
    "we estimate the amount of heating provided by the observed tev blazar population after correcting for the selection effects of the current pencil beam vhegr observations using the all - sky monitoring of the satellite .",
    "we will show that the luminosity density in vhegrs is of order @xmath20 of the quasar luminosity density , which dominates the photoheating rate at low @xmath21 .",
    "we then explore the qualitative and quantitative nature of this heating , which in essence , serves as an alternate feedback mechanism .",
    "in particular , tev blazars deposit heat evenly in a _",
    "volumetric _ sense , i.e. , independent of the local igm density .",
    "hence , this heating deposits more energy per baryon in low - density regions than in high - density regions , naturally producing an inverted temperature - density relation in voids . with only a minor rescaling of the empirically normalized of observed blazar heating",
    ", we find that it is possible to reproduce the inferred inverted temperature - density relation at @xmath22 @xcite , something which has proven to be a problem within the context of standard reionization models @xcite .    in ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iii ) , we will explore the result of this additional igm heating upon the formation of structure in the universe .",
    "in particular , we will show that the injection of entropy into the igm by tev blazars contributes to developing a redshift dependent entropy floor for galaxy clusters and groups at @xmath23 and suppresses the formation of dwarfs .",
    "we will highlight that the redshift dependent nature of tev blazar heating in our model suggests a large injection of entropy around @xmath24 , which boosts the entropy of late forming objects .",
    "this predicted enhanced entropy of young groups is consistent with recent observations that show optically bright and therefore young , groups and clusters are x - ray dim  that is having a lower gas density due to a raised entropy floor . we also will show that tev blazar heating suppresses the formation of late forming dwarfs both in galactic halos , i.e. , the missing satellite problem @xcite , and in voids , i.e. , the void phenomenon @xcite by raising the temperature of the igm such that gas can not collapse to form galaxies .",
    "this work is organized as follows : we first review the fate of energy carried by vhegr photons in section [ sec : pair propagation ] , discussed in detail in paper i. we describe how vhegr photons produce pairs in the igm and how these ultra - relativistic pair beams are unstable to plasma instabilities .",
    "in particular , we highlight the `` oblique '' instability , which is especially efficient at converting the kinetic energy of the beams into thermal energy in the igm .",
    "motivated by our review of paper i , we adopt the assumption that the kinetic energy of the ultra - relativistic pairs is thermalized in the igm , either via the `` oblique '' instability or some related mechanism . in section [",
    "sec : igmhr ] , we estimate the current tev - blazar igm heating rate by collating the known extragalactic tev blazars with a well measured spectrum , accounting for incompleteness ( section [ sec : z=0 heating ] ) .",
    "we use the similarity between the luminosity functions of nearby quasars and tev blazars found in paper i , to extend the heating rate to @xmath25 and estimate the tev - blazar covering fraction ( sections [ sec : z>0 heating ] and [ sec : homogeneity ] ) .",
    "the implications for the thermal history of low - density regions ( less than 10 times the mean density , i.e. , @xmath26 ) are explored in section [ sec : thermal history ] .",
    "generally , we find that without any fine tuning it is possible to reproduce the inverted temperature - density relation at @xmath22 inferred by high - redshift studies @xcite , while simultaneously satisfying the temperature constraints at @xmath27 ( e.g. , those by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and leaving the local forest unaffected .",
    "the results of this work and paper iii assume that the energy of tev blazars are efficiently thermalized in the igm .",
    "though we have identified a particularly promising instability , i.e. , the `` oblique '' instability , in paper i , the particular details by which the energy in ultra - relativistic pairs is thermalized are unimportant .",
    "instead , the results of this work and paper iii depend solely on the gross energetics of the tev blazars . as a consequence ,",
    "observations of the thermal history and constraints upon the structures in low - density regions represent an independent empirical probe of the fate of the ultra - relativistic pairs produced by tev blazars .    for all of the calculations presented below ( and in this series )",
    "we have assumed the wmap7 cosmology with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the observed extragalactic vhegr sources are all located at low redshift ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "this is a due to the annihilation of vhegrs on the ebl , producing ultra - relativistic @xmath33 pairs ( see ,",
    "e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we describe the fate of these vhegrs , and the consequences of propagating through the intergalactic medium ( igm ) for the pairs they produce .",
    "we refer the interested reader to sections 2 and 3 of paper i for a more complete discussion of the properties of the generated pairs and the importance and nature of plasma beam instabilities upon their propagation .",
    "vhegrs are attenuated by the pair production off ebl photons .",
    "namely , when the energies of the vhegrs ( @xmath34 ) and the ebl photon ( @xmath35 ) exceed the rest mass energy of the @xmath33 pair in the center of mass frame , i.e. , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the relative angle of propagation in the lab frame , an @xmath33 pair can be produced with lorentz factor @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "an estimate for the mean free path of vhegr photons is ( paper i ) @xmath39 where the redshift evolution is due to that of the ebl alone , is dependent predominately upon the star formation history , and @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 @xcite and declines rapidly afterward , galaxies and type 1 agns compensate for the lost flux until @xmath44 .",
    "see , for example , figure 3 from @xcite . ] .",
    "relative to the hubble length , the attenuation length of vhegrs is very short .",
    "in fact , above @xmath45 the universe is optically thick to sources at @xmath46 ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) .    since @xmath47 is much larger than any conceivable source size , and @xmath48 ,",
    "locally these pairs necessarily constitute a cold , highly anisotropic beam .",
    "the production of pairs by the interaction of vhegrs with the ebl is opposed by the removal of these pairs by various cooling processes .",
    "that is , the evolution of the characteristic pair - beam density at the injection lorentz factor , @xmath49 , is governed by the boltzmann equation : @xmath50 where the left - hand side assumes all the pairs are moving away from the vhegr source relativistically ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , the right - hand side corresponds to pair production , and @xmath53 is the cooling / removal rate of these pairs . in a homogeneous steady state , the rate of production is balanced by the rate of removal , which gives : @xmath54 where the rate of production is given by @xmath55 .",
    "generally , @xmath53 is a function of energy and beam energy and refer the reader to paper i for additional details .",
    "however , for any choice of @xmath53 , the solution to equation ( [ eq : nb ] ) gives @xmath56 .",
    "commonly , it is assumed that the pairs evolve primarily due to an icc which deposits the energy from the original vhegr photon near @xmath57 .",
    "note that this is fundamentally radiative ; after the vhegrs are scattered down to @xmath45 they effectively decouple from the universe .",
    "iccs of these pair beams widely exploited as a possible probe of igm magnetic fields in the context of the missing inverse compton features at @xmath45 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the associated cooling rate for this process for pairs with lorentz factor @xmath58 is @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the thompson cross section .",
    "the strong redshift dependence arises from the rapid increase in the cmb energy density with @xmath21 ( @xmath61 )",
    ".    however , this may not be the dominant process .",
    "as we showed in paper i , plasma beam instabilities are a potential mechanism by which the kinetic energy of the pairs is extracted much more rapidly .",
    "the two plasma beam instabilities most frequently discussed , the two stream and weibel instabilities , are particular limits of a more general instability , differentiated by the direction of the perturbed wave vector with respect to the beam orientation ( perpendicular for weibel , parallel for the two stream ; * ? ? ?",
    ". for dilute beams , by far the most powerful growth occurs at oblique angles , and thus named the `` oblique '' instability .",
    "paper i and @xcite gives a more extensive discussion of these three plasma instabilities .",
    "relative to the laboratory frame , these pair beams are `` cold '' , i.e. , their transverse momentum is much smaller than their parallel momentum , but even the small transverse temperatures that are acquired from pair production for these pair beams are important , placing the oblique instability in the kinetic regime . here , the oblique instability cooling rate has been numerically measured to be @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the igm free - electron number density ( assuming full ionization ) , @xmath64 is the elementary charge , and we have set the beam temperature in the beam frame to @xmath65 , characteristic of that induced by pair production , and thus @xmath66 @xcite . both the cold and hot growth rates have been verified explicitly using particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations , though at somewhat less dilute beams than the pair beams from tev blazars @xcite .    for the kinetic oblique instability ,",
    "the cooling rate is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the isotropic - equivalent luminosity per unit energy of the vhegr source .",
    "this is a stronger function of photon energy than inverse - compton cooling , implying that it will eventually dominate at sufficiently high energies , assuming a flat vhegr spectrum .",
    "in addition it is a very weak function of @xmath69 , being only marginally faster in lower - density regions , and thus the cooling of the pairs is largely independent of the properties of the background igm .",
    "the effective cooling rates induced by the `` oblique '' instability can be obtained by numerically solving equation ( [ eq : nb ] ) for @xmath49 , with @xmath70 as described in paper i. for the purpose of this paper , for tev blazars the effective cooling rate is generally dominated by the `` oblique '' mode and thus the fraction of vhegr emission that is effectively thermalized is nearly unity .",
    "therefore , we are justified in assuming that all of the vhegr emission is thermalized . in section [ sec : z>0",
    "heating ] we will briefly revisit this assumption at high @xmath21 , finding again that it is well justified at all @xmath21 .",
    "however , this may not be the case for all potential vhegr sources .",
    "the physics of the `` oblique '' instability , like all plasma beam instabilities , depends strongly upon the beam density . for the pair beams that result from vhegr - ebl photon interactions ,",
    "the beam density is a function of source luminosity .",
    "hence for sufficiently low luminosity systems , the `` oblique '' mode grows so slowly that inverse compton off of the cmb dominates it .",
    "this defines a critical isotropic - equivalent luminosity for plasma beam instabilities to be relevant , typically near @xmath71 , though depending upon redshift ( see figure 3 of paper i ) . for the tev blazars considered in this paper ,",
    "this is generally not a concern",
    ". however , this will be important in our discussion of alternative vhegr sources in section [ sec : alternatives ] .",
    "as we have argued in paper i and reviewed in section [ sec : pair propagation ] , plasma instabilities on the pair beam dissipate the bulk of the vhegr emission .",
    "in particular , the `` oblique '' instability appears to be a promising mechanism by which the ultra - relativistic pair beams that are produced from the interaction of vhegr and ebl photons blazars are efficiently thermalized and converted to local igm heating .",
    "henceforth , we will make the assumption for the rest of this work and again in paper iii that the energy of tev blazars is efficiently thermalized in the igm . with this stated assumption",
    ", we now discuss the sources that dominate the igm heating rate , estimate the magnitude of the heating rate and its evolution with redshift , and briefly assess the homogeneity with which this new process occurs .",
    "the local heating rate associated with the dissipation of the high - energy emission from a single blazar is determined by two factors : the rate at which the vhegrs are converted into pairs and the rate at which the energy of the pairs is subsequently converted locally into heat .",
    "the former is determined by the pair - production cross - section . due to the efficiency of the plasma instabilities in dissipating the beam energy , the latter",
    "is set by the ratio of the relevant cooling rates .",
    "that is , the single - blazar heating rate is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a dimensionless function due to the pair - creation threshold and which depends upon the shape of the ebl spectrum ( we set @xmath73 to vanish for @xmath74 and be unity otherwise ) , and @xmath75 which is a function of @xmath76 , @xmath34 , and @xmath21 via the dependence of the cooling rates upon @xmath49 , @xmath58 , and @xmath21 .",
    "generically , @xmath77 represents the fraction of pair energy that is thermalized , but we have chosen a specific form of @xmath77 corresponding to the `` oblique '' instability to make the discussion below more concrete . while it is also very weakly dependent upon @xmath69 ,",
    "this may be neglected in practice .    within the linear regime the plasma instabilities responsible for the dissipation of pair beam energy",
    "are independent of those arising from beams in substantially different directions .",
    "since the local vhegr flux is dominated by a number of sources that is small in comparison to that needed to isotropize the beam s phase space , we may treat the resulting evolutions of their associated pair beams independently and sum their resulting heating rates to determine the total heating rate , @xmath78 .",
    "( see paper i ) ; hence we would need @xmath79 blazars to isotropize any given point in space .",
    "however , as will be shown in section [ sec : homogeneity ] the number of blazars that contribute substantially to the local heating rate is much smaller ; hence we believe the local pair distribution function is sufficiently anisotropic . ]",
    "the local heating rate can be estimated in at least two ways , both of which give similar results .",
    "first , since the high - energy gamma rays deposit their energy locally , we can identify the local heating rate with the high - energy gamma - ray luminosity density of tev blazars . in paper i we showed that this is roughly @xmath80 that of quasars , and",
    "thus approximately @xmath81@xmath82@xmath83 , depending upon the minimum luminosity at which the heating mechanism operates .",
    "alternatively , given a sufficiently complete sample , we can estimate the local heating rate using that implied by the fluxes of the observed tev blazars . in the present epoch , @xmath84 at the relevant @xmath34 , and thus the heating rate takes the particularly simple form : @xmath85 to evaluate this sum , we have collated the presently 46 extragalactic vhegr sources known.rwagner/sources/ for an up - to - date list .",
    "] of these 46 , only 28 have published measurements of their vhegr flux from a combination of veritas , h.e.s.s . , and magic observations .",
    "for these 28 sources , we have extracted the parametrized spectra assuming the form , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the normalization in units of @xmath88 . the gamma - ray energy flux is trivially related to @xmath89 by @xmath90 , from which we obtain a vhegr flux , @xmath91 and for sources with a measured redshift a corresponding isotropic - equivalent luminosity , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the luminosity distance .",
    "the resulting @xmath87 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 are collected in table [ tab : tevsources ] .",
    "in addition we list the redshift , inferred distance , and absorption - corrected intrinsic spectral index at @xmath94 , obtained via @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the optical depth accrued by a vhegr emitted at redshift @xmath21 and with observed energy @xmath34 . in paper i , where there we set @xmath34 to the _ emitted _ energy of the gamma ray .",
    "a full definition at arbitrary observer redshift can be found in equation ( [ eq : tau ] ) . ] for high - redshift sources @xmath100 can be less than @xmath101 , implying that an intrinsic spectral upper - cutoff must exist . here",
    "we conservatively take this to be at @xmath102 , which is well justified given the distances to the two sources that dominate the observed local @xmath103 flux , mkn 421 and 1es 1959 + 650 , though as we shall see below , the heating rate is relatively insensitive to the particular values of the lower and upper spectral cutoffs .",

    ", we also adopt an `` optimistic '' heating model that is normalized to fit the observed igm inverted temperature - density relation @xcite .",
    "this `` optimistic '' model has @xmath132 yielding a heating rate of @xmath133 .    in estimating @xmath78 from equation ( [ eq : qdotest2 ] ) we have made a number of implicit assumptions .",
    "first , we have assumed that the observed distribution of tev blazars locally is representative of the average distribution at _ any given point _ in the universe .",
    "since the blazars that have been observed locally go out to @xmath134 , we believe this is a relatively safe assumption .",
    "second , we have assumed that the current sample of blazars is sufficiently flux - complete to dominate the heating rate at earth .",
    "that is , we have assumed that the effective flux limit of the current generation of cerenkov telescopes is low enough that it captures the bulk of the sources responsible for the local heating of the igm . that this is the case is less clear , and will be the subject of section [ sec : homogeneity ] and the appendix in some detail .",
    "unfortunately , since the constant of proportionality relating the local tev blazar and quasar luminosity densities is obtained using the observed set of blazars , our two estimates are strongly correlated .",
    "nevertheless , this provides a convenient lower limit upon @xmath78 , and we use this heating rate , which we denote the `` standard '' heating rate , as the mean heating rate of any fluid element in the present - day universe . over a hubble time , the total heat deposited per unit volume is then roughly @xmath135 which is sufficient to raise the temperature of @xmath136 regions to approximately @xmath137 , and thus dramatically alter the thermal history of voids .      extrapolating the above estimate to @xmath25 requires understanding how the tev blazar properties and population have evolved , as well as the evolution in @xmath138 .",
    "generally , the average heating rate is given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the physical number density of blazars at a given redshift per unit logarithmic isotropic - equivalent luminosity , spectral index , and blazar jet opening angle ( we ve assumed all jets are symmetric ) .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that @xmath141 is separable into components describing the evolving luminosity density distribution , @xmath142 , and a static , unit - normalized spectral distribution , @xmath143 , where @xmath144 .",
    "this produces , @xmath145 where the bulk of the redshift and luminosity dependence is now contained in the outer - most integral over @xmath146 , and we have used @xmath147 ( since the heating is dominated by nearby objects , for simplicity we do not distinguish between different cosmological distance definitions , though see the appendix for a more careful treatment ) . if there were no redshift or flux dependence in the remaining terms , it would be possible to simply normalize the heating rate by @xmath148 and the estimated tev - blazar luminosity density , which we define to be @xmath149 where @xmath150 is chosen so that the plasma instabilities operate efficiently at all redshifts of interest .",
    "however , this is not entirely the case since @xmath138 retains some dependence upon @xmath21 , and thus we set @xmath151 where @xmath152 provides a correction due to the changing strength of the pair beam dissipation mechanism in comparison to inverse - compton cooling .",

    "this simplifies the estimation of @xmath152 significantly , giving @xmath158 in which the form and magnitude of @xmath68 is fixed .",

    "this insert is a simplified reproduction of figure 5 of paper i. [ f : bld ] ]    therefore , obtaining the heating rate as a function of @xmath21 is reduced to estimating @xmath167 , the normalized evolution of the blazar luminosity density . however , no vhegr emitting blazars are known beyond @xmath168 , presumably due to the pair - creation absorption associated with propagation through the ebl . as a consequence , nothing",

    "furthermore , we showed that once the iccs are suppressed by the plasma beam instabilities ( or some analogous mechanism ) , extending this relationship to high-@xmath21 was in excellent agreement with the best current constraints upon the high-@xmath21 tev blazar population : the tev blazar statistics and the measurement of the extragalactic gamma - ray background ( between @xmath176 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "thus , we estimate @xmath177 , shown in figure [ f : bld ] , where @xmath178 is the luminosity density of quasars .",
    "figure [ f : bld ] shows that employing the quasar luminosity density to estimate the heating rates has profound consequences .",
    "in particular , the inferred luminosity density of tev blazars ( solid line ) rises rapidly with increasing @xmath21 , with the comoving density increasing by roughly a factor of @xmath179 by @xmath27 ( see also figure 8 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in physical units this corresponds to a increase by a factor of nearly @xmath180 .",
    "thus , we expect an increase in the local heating rate by a similar factor over the presently estimated value near @xmath27 .",

    "third , the importance of clustering bias is unclear .",
    "fourth , it is difficult even to define which blazars are relevant , e.g. , which luminosity range contributes the bulk of the local heating .",

    "for reference the spectrally averaged ( with @xmath183 ) mean free path , @xmath184 , and the local mean free path for a @xmath156 gamma ray are shown by the grey solid and dashed lines , respectively . for sources with a spectral break between @xmath45 and @xmath156 , we anticipate the effective mean free path to lie between these . ]",

    "since we have determined @xmath170 from the observed blazar population , and are making use of the isotropic - equivalent luminosities , this is independent of the blazar jet opening angle ; smaller opening angles will result in a correspondingly larger number of objects such that the total number seen is unchanged , and therefore @xmath188 is fixed .",
    "a comparison between @xmath188 and the mean free path of vhegrs is shown in figure [ f : bms ] . because @xmath47 varies dramatically from @xmath45 to @xmath181 , for this purpose , we define a spectrally averaged mean free path , @xmath184 , determined implicitly by @xmath189 in which we choose @xmath183 based upon the local tev blazar sample .",
    "this is roughly the @xmath64-folding distance of the entire spectral band , shown in figure [ f : bms ] by the grey solid line , and in practice is quite close to @xmath190 .",
    "if the intrinsic tev blazar spectra peak above @xmath45 , our estimate of the typical vhegr mean free path could be significantly too large ; thus we also compare @xmath188 to @xmath47 at @xmath156 ( the grey dashed line in figure [ f : bms ] ) , providing an extreme lower - bound upon the spectrally averaged mean free path in practice .",
    "the rapid increase of the density of ebl photons with @xmath21 , associated with the larger star formation rate in the recent past , results in a substantially reduced @xmath47 by @xmath44 . prior to @xmath44 ,",

    "near @xmath197 the mean separation of tev blazars is largest in comparison to the vhegr mean free path .",

    "both are well above unity , with the luminosity - weighted median value substantially exceeding our estimate of roughly 170 visible extragalactic tev blazars .",
    "we have listed 23 tev blazars , but a correction factor of 7.5 needs to be applied to account for the incompleteness of present tev surveys .",
    "] however , since generally @xmath206 not all of the blazars that contribute to the local heating are expected to appear as strong tev sources .",
    "the low-@xmath21 behavior of the number of blazars is dictated by the rapid evolution in @xmath47 , associated with the recent rapid variation in the star formation rate ( and thus the number density of ebl photons ) .",
    "prior to @xmath44 , the ebl density , and hence @xmath47 , is roughly constant in physical units , and the evolution number of visible blazars becomes indicative of the underlying evolution of blazar population .",
    "at all @xmath199",
    "these estimates of the number of blazars responsible for the bulk of the heating , @xmath207 , exceed unity , implying only a small fractional spatial variation in the blazar heating rate .",
    "however , while the luminosity - weighted median estimate of @xmath207 does give some idea of which population is responsible for most of the tev blazar luminosity density , neither encapsulates the population responsible for the majority of the local heating .",
    "thus , if the local heating were dominated by a handful of luminous sources , it is possible for the stochasticity to be much larger .",
    "therefore , we show a third estimate of @xmath207 , corresponding to the number of sources with @xmath208s larger than the heating - rate - weighted median value ( see the appendix for a precise definition ) . that is , at a given redshift , the @xmath207 sources with the highest @xmath208s generate half of the total heating rate .",
    "thus , if a single source were to dominate the local heating rate , @xmath207 would be considerably less than unity , indicating a large degree of variability .",
    "however , below @xmath209 this is not the case ; the fractional heating rate - defined @xmath207 is considerably larger than unity . at high redshifts",
    "the heating rate becomes increasingly dominated by more distant , luminous , and rarer objects , departing from the previous estimate of @xmath207 .",
    "nevertheless , while for @xmath210 few sources contribute nearly half of the heating rate , the total heating rate must be comparable to the total vhegr luminosity density of the blazars .",
    "therefore , the total number of contributing objects must be similar to the number of visible blazars above the luminosity - weighted median @xmath97 ( i.e. , the red dotted line in figure [ f : numblazars ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of relevant sources must rapidly rise with decreasing fractional heating rate .",
    "this is explicitly indicated by the dashed line in figure [ f : numblazars ] , which shows the number of sources responsible for 75% of the local heating rate .    in any case , it is clear that for the redshifts at which blazar heating is likely to be important , @xmath211 , the heating rate will be relatively uniform .",
    "between @xmath212 it may experience order 50% fluctuations , and by @xmath200 will exhibit order unity deviation .",
    "however , we note that all of our estimates of the heating inhomogeneity are predicated upon the assumption that the @xmath170 accurately represents the distribution of blazars , and has the associated considerable uncertainties . for a more thorough discussion of different estimates of the number of contributing blazars , and a discussion of which blazars dominate the heating rate at a given redshift , see the appendix .",
    "in addition to the statistics of blazars , the homogeneity also depends upon the intrinsic variability of tev blazars . during the time that the tev blazars",
    "have been observed their vhegr emission has remained remarkably stable .",
    "however , this provides only a weak lower limit ( @xmath213 ) upon the variability timescale in these objects @xcite .",
    "in addition to depending upon the properties of the source itself , the variability of tev blazars depends upon the primary emission mechanism responsible for the vhegr component of tev blazars .",
    "there are two classes of inverse - compton models to explain the vhegr emission :    1 .",
    "_ synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model : _ in this model , the synchrotron radiation field is compton up - scattered to tev energies by a relativistic electron population @xcite .",
    "recent work has led to the conclusion that a simple homogeneous , one - zone , ssc model can not explain the sed of the majority of blazars ( see figure 36 of * ? ? ?",
    "however , models with multiple ssc components are consistent with the blazar seds .",
    "typically these invoke a steady , primary ssc component which peaks at the ir / optical ( s ) and @xmath58-ray band ( ic ) , and a second more energetic and usually more variable component , which peaks in the uv or x - ray band ( s ) and at gev / tev energies ( ic ) .",
    "the variability of this energetic component increases the probability that a given patch of the igm will see a tev blazar during its history , resulting in larger homogeneity in the blazar heating .",
    "external radiation compton ( erc ) scenario : _ this model proposes that the relativistic jet electrons compton scatter an external radiation field @xcite from the accretion disk or the dusty torus surrounding it . in the first case , the disk generates uv seed photons which are then reflected toward the jet by the broad line region within a typical distance from the accretion disk of the order of 1 pc . in the second case , the dusty torus could provide ir seed photons that are emitted at larger distances from the jet . in any of these erc models ,",

    "this is most directly done by considering those tev sources which produce , say , 50% of the total heating rate at a given observer redshift .",
    "given this population , we may also now address the properties of the most relevant sources themselves ; i.e. , we can identify which types of tev blazars dominate the heating .",
    "as we have already mentioned , this can not be too different from the set of blazars which dominate the luminosity density .",
    "we address this question in some detail in the appendix , including constructing a simple analytical toy model .",
    "figure [ f : dqdl ] shows the luminosity distribution of the heating - rate integrand once integrated over distance and assuming our form for @xmath224 ( see the appendix for a precise definition ) .",
    "the upper - half of the heating rate is dominated by sources with luminosities of approximately @xmath153 at low redshifts , and rises to @xmath159 by @xmath225 before declining slightly thereafter .",
    "this evolution is driven both by the changing shape and the changing normalization of @xmath170 with redshift . at all redshifts",
    "this is larger than the median luminosity .",
    "thus , generally it appears that the heating is due predominantly to high - luminosity objects . due to the relatively small @xmath184 , these are",
    "also necessarily nearby .      up to now , our focus on the tev - blazars is motivated by the fact that the vast majority of extragalactic vhegr sources observed are blazars . other potential source of vhegr emission exist and so we will discuss these sources in this section . in assessing their potential contribution in vhegrs , however , we find that these vhegr sources are subdominant .",
    "starburst galaxies are characterized by the presence of rapid star formation , and hence , are sites of numerous supernovae .",
    "supernovae are known to be efficient particle accelerators , and are presumed to be the primary source of the galactic cosmic rays . as cosmic rays can produce vhegrs , starburst galaxies are potentially bright vhegr sources .",
    "while many starburst galaxies contain active agn , that may also emit vhegrs , unambiguous vhegr emission form the starburst itself has been seen in at least two cases , m82 and ngc 253 , with @xmath0 luminosities of @xmath226 and @xmath227 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of these two sources are dwarfed by the local tev blazars , and thus the vhegr flux from m82 and ngc 253 does not contribute to the heating of the local igm .",
    "in addition , their vhegr luminosity produces a pair beam which is too dilute for plasma processes such as the `` oblique '' instability to beat cooling via inverse compton .",
    "hence , they do not contribute to the local vhegr flux .",
    "however , very high star - forming systems such as the ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) where @xmath228 ) and @xmath229 is the bolometric infrared luminosity ( @xmath230 ) , may evade this constraint . if the vhegr emission from starburst galaxies is due to cosmic rays accelerated by supernovae , the vhegr luminosity above @xmath45 , @xmath97 is then proportional to the star formation rate . for starbursts ,",
    "this is linearly related to the continuum infrared luminosity @xcite .",
    "thus , normalizing by m82 and ngc 253 , we have @xmath231 while this relationship is extremely uncertain ( the normalization varies by a factor of two between m82 and ngc 253 ) , it suggests that ulirgs , or perhaps hyper - luminous infrared galaxies ( hlirgs , @xmath232 ) may be sufficiently bright to contribute to the heating of the igm .",
    "while the fluxes from the brightest ulirgs remain much smaller than those associated with the typical tev blazars , there are many more starburst galaxies than agn . at all redshifts",
    "ulirgs constitute the high - luminosity tail of the star - forming galaxy luminosity functions @xcite . in the present epoch ,",
    "the density of ulirgs is roughly @xmath233 , and thus the corresponding vhegr luminosity density of these objects , @xmath234 ( see table 8 of * ? ? ?",
    "is negligible in comparison to the tev blazars , roughly @xmath235 .",
    "however , due to the steep decline of the luminosity function in the ulirg range , small changes in the location of the break luminosity result in large changes in the comoving luminosity density of ulirgs . as a consequence , the comoving luminosity density of ulirgs grows much faster than that of quasars ( and thus presumably the tev blazars )",
    "nevertheless , even at @xmath27 , roughly the redshift of peak star formation , the comoving number density of ulirgs remains below @xmath236 ( see table 8 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , corresponding to a comoving vhegr luminosity density of @xmath237 , more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the contemporaneous tev blazar population .",
    "for this reason , we neglect the starburst contribution to heating the igm here , though they may represent an secondary source class .",
    "stellar - mass objects , such as magnetars and x - ray binaries , generally have difficulty reaching the flux limits required for plasma cooling to dominate the pair beam evolution . even at eddington - limited vhegr luminosities ,",
    "reaching isotropic - equivalent luminosities of @xmath71 requires beaming factors of roughly @xmath238 , corresponding to jet opening angles of roughly @xmath239 . in practice ,",
    "the formation of radio jets is believed to be associated with substantially sub - eddington accretion flows in these objects , and thus exacerbating the beaming requirement .",
    "more importantly , these sources may suffer compactness problems : the vhegr emission regions in stellar - mass jets must necessarily be very far from the central object to avoid in situ pair - production .",
    "finally , were x - ray binaries and magnetars generally strong , persistent vhegr emitters with sufficiently large fluxes , we would expect that many would have been already detected .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are natural candidates due to their large luminosities and strong inferred beaming , and we consider them as a example of the general class of energetic transient sources . unfortunately , little is known about the vhegr emission of grbs .",
    "presently there is a single report of a tev signal associated with a grb ( grb 970417a , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though due to the large distances at which they can be observed and comparative rarity this is not unexpected .",
    "however , such high - energy emission is possible in principle , presumably due to inverse - comptonization of the prompt emission and/or x - ray afterglow ( see section viii of * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "fermi observations of grbs have shown that for many events the band spectrum can be extended to @xmath57 @xcite , though in at least one case a spectral break below @xmath240 has been observed ( grb 090926a , * ? ? ?",
    "thus it remains unclear if in practice the high - energy emission is attenuated within the emission region .",
    "moreover , since grbs are inherently short - lived events , the luminosity limits described in paper i , which require the vhegr emitting phase to last for a plasma cooling timescale ( roughly @xmath241@xmath242 ) , are not directly applicable .",
    "a similar analysis , obtained by limiting the beam growth time to the grb duration , gives vhegr isotropic - equivalent energies of @xmath243 .",
    "this is comparable to the total prompt and afterglow emission for only the brightest bursts , comprising roughly 5% of grbs observed by swift @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even assuming that all grbs produce the requisite high energy emission , at an optimistic present local rate of roughly @xmath244 , produces a comoving luminosity density of @xmath245 , roughly three orders of magnitude less than that due to tev blazars at @xmath44 .",
    "the previous sections have shown that the vhegr emission from luminous tev blazars heats the igm , quantified the magnitude and stochasticity of this heating locally , and estimated its evolution as a function of redshift .",
    "we are now in a position to discuss its impact on the thermal history of the igm in detail . in the following",
    "we will show that tev blazar heating can be substantial , dominating late time photoheating , and that its uniform nature naturally imprints its signature onto the temperature - density relation of the igm .",

    "the rate of heating in this case depends linearly on the radiative output of these tev blazars , and is independent of the atomic physics of the igm .",
    "in addition these sources have a constant heating rate per unit volume ( whereas photoheating heats per unit mass ) .",
    "hence , the effect of blazar heating , which is already pronounced , is amplified relative to photoheating in low - density regions , leading to an inverted temperature - density relation . therefore , not only is the memory of photoheating is erased in low - density regions , but it is overwritten by the record of blazar heating .    following this work , we have recently completed a study of the effects of blazar heating in a more detailed hydrodynamic model of structure formation , reported in a follow - up paper @xcite . using the blazar heating prescription given by equation ( [ eq : fit ] ) , we show that the optical depth of the  forest is reproduced using a h photoionization rate of @xmath330 or equivalently using the inferred ionizing background from @xcite .",
    "we also confirm that the low density igm again possesses an inverted temperature - density relation ( as shown in figure [ f : qlf eos ] ) .",
    "in addition , a detailed comparison between the results of our numerical calculations and observations show that a blazar heated universe matches the one- and two- points statistics of the high redshift ly@xmath95 forest , but also matches the line width distribution .",
    "this excellent agreement was achieved using the best estimate on the evolution of the photoionizing background ( without tuning ) and is due to the excess energy injection into the low density igm .",

    "the lowest values for which measurements exist , the simulations find that the local forest is produced primarily by the intergalactic filaments , corresponding to @xmath335@xmath336 ( e.g. , see the bottom - left panel of figure 8 and figure 9 of * ? ? ?",
    "we emphasize this point with the following order - of - magnitude estimate .",
    "an upper limit upon cloud sizes can be obtained using the line widths , @xmath337 , translating into a proper size of @xmath338 @xcite .",
    "a lower limit upon the local ionizing background can be inferred from the optical depth of vhegrs , giving @xmath339 @xcite . employing ionization balance to set the hi fraction , for @xmath41",
    "this gives the column densities @xmath340 for @xmath341 . from this",
    "it is clear that the nearby clouds must correspond to regions with @xmath342 . at @xmath46",
    ", we would nevertheless expect low - density regions to contribute significantly to the high-@xmath21 forest , as has indeed been found to be the case . ]    at these overdensities , the impact of blazar heating on their thermal history is modest at best .",
    "by @xmath343 the blazars change the igm temperature by a factor of 2 , raising it to roughly @xmath344 , comparable to the temperatures typical of the local clouds @xcite . at",
    "@xmath345 blazar heating is negligible in comparison to photoionization and shock - heating .",
    "thus , because low-@xmath21 absorbers are biased toward high - density regions , they serve a poor probes of low - density regions and are unaffected by the effects of tev blazars .",
    "the inclusion of blazar heating into these large - scale hydrodynamic calculations is an important next step .",
    "however , we do not expect a significant impact on the local forest",
    ". a more important impact of tev blazar heating would be on the formation of collapsed structures , which is a topic that we will explore in paper iii .",
    "as low - density regions are immune to local probes , we now turn to the question whether there are methods of directly inferring the presence of such high temperatures in these regions .",
    "first , we compute the mean comptonization of the cmb due to blazar heating , @xmath346 where @xmath347 is the free electron density . here , @xmath347 is the physical density of free electrons and we integrate along the proper distance of the photons back to recombination , @xmath348 where the minus sign arises due to the choice of coordinates which are centered on the observer . performing the integral with our temperature evolutions at mean density ( i.e. neglecting gravitational heating by formation shocks ) yields mean comptonization values of @xmath349 for our models without blazar heating and those with standard and optimistic blazar heating .",
    "to date the best limits on the mean comptonization come from the cosmic background explorer far - infrared absolute spectrophotometer experiment ( cobe firas ) which measure the difference between the cmb and a perfect black - body spectrum @xcite .",
    "their upper limit of @xmath350 ( 95% confidence level ) is perfectly consistent with our inferred mean comptonizations . with current technology",
    ", it appears to be quite feasible to measure the deviation of the cmb spectrum from a perfect blackbody form with an accuracy and precision of 1 ppm yielding constraints on the cosmic @xmath351-parameter at the level of @xmath352 and provide a spectrum of the anisotropy to 10% @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the mean comptonization is expected to be dominated by gravitational heating which leads to values of @xmath353 inferred from cosmological simulations by @xcite .",
    "the mean temperature of these cosmological simulations of @xmath354 suggests that the signal is dominated by collapsed galaxy groups and unvirialized infall regions onto galaxy clusters that constitute the hot component of the warm - hot intergalactic medium .",
    "hence , in order to measure the blazar heating signal in the mean comptonization of the cmb , the fluctuating part due to gravitational heating would have to be subtracted first .",
    "since galaxy groups dominate the fluctuation power on angular scales of @xmath355 , the measurement of the deviation of the cmb spectrum would have to be performed on these small angular scales which appears to be difficult .",
    "second , we estimate the emission of the igm due to free - free emission ( bremsstrahlung ) and synchrotron emission . turning to the question of synchrotron emission",
    ", we estimate the synchrotron frequency using a maximal igmf strength of @xmath356 g. at temperatures of @xmath357 k , the electrons in the igm are nonrelativistic .",
    "hence the synchrotron frequency is roughly the larmor frequency , @xmath358 .",
    "these low frequencies are well below the plasma frequency of the igm , @xmath359 hz and , hence , will be absorbed by the igm .",
    "free - free emission from the igm can cause a distortion in the cmb at low frequencies @xcite . as the free - free emissivity scales like @xmath360 for fully ionized primordial gas ,",
    "it scales weakly with temperature but strongly with clumpiness . as a result ,",
    "overdense haloes dominate free - free emission , with the contribution from low density igm being 1 - 3 orders of magnitude smaller @xcite .",
    "the effect of blazar heating will further suppress this free - free emission ( albeit mildly ) from the igm compared to that of overdense halos .",
    "finally , the best constraints on this free - free optical depth of @xmath361 @xcite is still too large compared to optimistic models of free - free emission from overdense haloes by at least an order of magnitude and by @xmath310 orders of magnitude from the smooth igm @xcite .",
    "thus far , we have concerned ourselves with the impact of tev blazars on the universe at large . in this section ,",
    "we invert this argument and discuss how the universe at large can be used as a probe of the physics of vhegr photons and the global properties of tev blazars .",
    "namely , the estimated heating rates used in this paper  standard and optimistic  suffer from a number of uncertainties , including statistical fluctuations in the number of presently observed vhegr sources , the redshift evolution of the tev blazar luminosity density , and the detailed form of the vhegr and ebl spectra .",
    "however , due to the high efficiency with which the vhegr luminosity of blazars is converted to heat within cosmic voids , the temperature history of the voids themselves provides a way to determine the cumulative tev blazar luminosity density empirically .",
    "this is possible due to a number of fortuitous properties of voids and tev blazar heating .",
    "first , the high efficiency with which the vhegr emission of blazars is converted to heat implies that even in voids the universe acts as a calorimeter .",
    "second , blazar heating dominates the thermal history of voids for @xmath211 ( see , e.g. , figure [ f : rates ] ) so that this calorimeter is uncontaminated .",
    "we caution that heii reionization complicates matters somewhat , though in our model makes a comparatively small correction to the temperature evolution of low - density regions ( see figure [ f : thermal history ] ) .",
    "however , this depends upon the particular manner in which heii reionization occurred , and could in principle provide a somewhat larger contribution in inhomogeneous reionization scenarios ( see section 3 of * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "finally , within voids the adiabatic losses to hubble expansion are very accurately modeled in the linear regime , substantially simplifying the interpretation of void temperature histories .",
    "perhaps the greatest uncertainty is the physics of the mechanism which converts pair beams from tev blazars to thermal energy in the igm . in the context of the `` oblique '' instability ,",
    "what is unclear is the luminosity cutoff of tev blazars probed in this manner , which arises from the competition between inverse - compton and plasma processes . if this cutoff may be conservatively assumed to lie at an isotropic - equivalent @xmath362 , corresponding to a true luminosity 23 orders of magnitude lower due to the presumed jet beaming , then this is dimmer than all but two of the tev blazars known . assuming that the tev blazar luminosity function follows that of quasars , the luminosity density is dominated by sources near the break luminosity , and thus as long as the lower - luminosity cutoff is sufficiently low ( below that of the break luminosity ) it may be neglected . for the tev blazars listed in table [ tab : tevsources",
    "] , this break occurs near @xmath363 , and thus is well above the relevant cutoff .",
    "measurements of the thermal history of voids directly corresponds to the tev blazar bolometric luminosity evolution . in this manner",
    ", the thermal history of cosmic voids provides an analogous argument to that by @xcite for determining the blazar luminosity density , @xmath298 .",
    "such a constraint on the history of @xmath298 can be used to study the history of accretion in the universe and the jet forming efficiency by comparing it to the history quasar or active galaxy luminosity density .",
    "while probes of the low - density igm at low redshift are sparse , the situation at @xmath364 is much more hopeful as we have discussed in section [ sec : igm blazar heating ]",
    ". thus , precision measurements of the forest at @xmath364 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) alongside detailed studies of heii reionization ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) offer the best constraint both on the fate of vhegr photons and the evolution of tev blazars , i.e. , the blazar luminosity density .",
    "in this work , we have explored the effect of tev blazar heating on the thermal history of the igm .",
    "we have argued that vhegrs that are sufficiently hard to pair produce off of the ebl , will inevitably dump the majority of their energy into the igm via plasma instabilities . by collating the nearby 28 tev blazars with firm spectral measurements , we have determined the local observed heating rate after correcting for the various selection effects using observations of tev blazars .",
    "this local heating rate of @xmath365 , which we call the standard model , can be extended to higher redshift by normalizing it to the @xcite quasar luminosity density .",
    "this follows from the important result of paper i , which shows that the local observed blazar luminosity function is well in line with the local quasar luminosity function corrected by a factor of @xmath366 .",
    "this tev blazar heating should be relatively homogeneous at all redshifts @xmath163 with greater spatial variations for at higher @xmath21 , approaching order unity at @xmath2 .",
    "this redshift dependent blazar heating is substantial and is larger than the photoheating rate by a factor of 15 ( standard ) - 30 ( optimistic ) after he reionization for a @xmath280 patch of the universe . using a simple one - zone model of the igm",
    ", we demonstrate that the effect of including tev blazar heating versus not including tev blazar heating leads to qualitative and quantitative changes in the thermal history of the igm .",
    "first , the injection of heat into the igm by blazars substantially increases the temperature of the igm . in the case with blazar heating ,",
    "the temperature of the igm stays above @xmath238 k , with some regions approaching @xmath367 k , whereas without blazar heating , the temperature of the igm tends to stay below @xmath238 k. second , the even volumetric heating rate of blazars impacts the thermal history of low - density regions much more strongly than higher density regions .",
    "low - density regions are substantially hotter as a result with temperatures in excess of @xmath368 k. higher density regions on the other hand are not heated as much by blazars .",
    "this naturally produces an inverted temperature - density relation which matches the empirical results of @xcite if we increase the amount of blazar heating , i.e. , the optimistic model , to @xmath369 .",
    "it also provides an encouraging endorsement of our model as such inverted temperature - density relations are difficult to produce in standard reionization histories",
    ". we have demonstrated these salient points more explicitly in a follow up paper @xcite , where we calculate the effect of blazar heating in a hydrodynamic realization of the universe .",
    "we show that the comparison between a blazar heated universe and observation of the high redshift ly@xmath95 forest gives excellent quantitative agreement .",
    "as our model predicts a substantially hotter low - density igm that standard models predict , we then proceeded to investigate either if this model breaks current constraints on the local temperature of the igm or can be directly measured .",
    "unfortunately , the local forest is an ineffective probe of this environment compared to the high-@xmath21 forest as the regions that give rise to the local forest are dense regions that remain relatively unaffected by the effects of blazar heating .",
    "other means of directly probing this hot igm via comptonization of the cmb and free - free emission emission are also unlikely .",
    "finally , we note that the thermodynamics of the igm can be used as a calorimeter for vhegr emission of blazars in the universe .",
    "namely , because the low - density igm is so sensitive to the total amount of energy dumped into it , which is dominated by tev blazars , we argue that the thermal history of the low - density igm can be used to measure the total energy output in vhegrs over cosmic time . in principle , this would allow a determination of the blazar luminosity density as a function of redshift , as well as constrain the history and physics of accretion onto supermassive black holes , i.e. , rates of radiative versus radiative inefficient accretion and jet formation efficiency",

    "typically , where the blazar population is rapidly evolving it tends to be a poor estimate of the number of sources , overestimating this number by nearly an order of magnitude at @xmath399 .",
    "as long as @xmath224 evolves slowly and @xmath400 it is unnecessary to perform the relevant redshift integral to get the volume element .",

    "of course , this is by construction since @xmath170 was obtained from the observed population .",
    "nevertheless , it is striking that many more objects would have been observed above this flux limit during earlier epochs , vastly exceeding any of the preceding approximations of @xmath207 .",
    "however , it does not necessarily follow that all of these sources will have contributed substantially to the heating rate .",
    "the most relevant approximation for @xmath207 , and the one we adopt as our primary definition , is set by the heating rates directly . the general idea is to do what we do naturally at earth : arrange all of the sources visible by an observer at @xmath373 by the local heating rate they induce , from largest to smallest , and count until a fixed fraction of the total heating rate is reached .",
    "that is , set @xmath207 to be the minimum number of sources ( on average ) required to produce a given fraction of the total heating rate .",
    "given its direct connection with the heating rate , this provides the most natural definition of the number of sources `` responsible for the bulk of the heating . ''",
    "to do this , however , we first must explicitly define the heating rate in terms of the appropriate functions .",

    "since @xmath404 is a strong function of @xmath456 , contributions from different distances have different luminosity distributions .",
    "it is possible to roughly characterize this by defining a typical luminosity , @xmath434 , associated with contributions at a given @xmath456 : @xmath457 with @xmath404 , this is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ f : euds ] .",
    "generally @xmath434 is larger than @xmath404 , and for small @xmath458 substantially so .",
    "thus , even for nearly flat @xmath459 ( @xmath460 ) the objects that contribute to the heating are _ not _ dominated by the numerous , intrinsically dim objects with luminosities @xmath461 .",
    "alternatively , we may perform the integral over @xmath456 first , in which the flux limit implies a maximum distance to which a given object can be seen , @xmath462 , providing some insight into luminosity of the sources responsible for the heating .",
    "doing so yields @xmath463 this is shown in figure [ f : dqedl ] for a variety of @xmath439 . in all cases",
    "the luminosity at the break in @xmath459 , i.e. , @xmath438 , contributes most significantly to the heating rate .",
    "however , the relative importance of lower - luminosity objects does depend upon the luminosity function ; flat luminosity functions ( i.e. , @xmath427 ) have many low - luminosity sources , and thus induce more broad @xmath464 .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that the heating rate in our simple toy model is generally dominated by nearby objects near the peak in the luminosity function .",
    "-limited sample of objects .",
    "different colors correspond to different @xmath373 , indicated by the left - most value of @xmath21 for which each intersects the horizontal axis ( @xmath373 ranging from 0 to 4 ) , and are consistent with those used in figure [ f : dqdl ] . for reference , the redshifts at which",
    "@xmath465 and @xmath186 are shown by the vertical and horizontal dotted lines , respectively . in comparison to @xmath404",
    ", we also show @xmath434 ( as defined by equation ( [ eq : leffb ] ) ) by the dash - dot lines .",
    "finally , the upper - right panel shows @xmath466 for each of the redshifts for which distributions are shown in the other panels , with corresponding colors ( note that this shows the same relative dynamic range as that in the inset of figures [ f : euds ] and may thus be directly compared ) . ]",
    "we now return to the physically relevant case : heating due to tev blazars with an evolving luminosity function in an evolving universe . here",
    "we specify the distributions of the sources responsible for producing a fraction @xmath420 of the total heating rate . in this case",
    ", we may immediately read off @xmath467 and @xmath468 , the analogs of @xmath469 and @xmath470 , from equations ( [ eq : niv ] ) and ( [ eq : qdiv ] ) , respectively , yielding , @xmath471\\\\ \\begin{aligned } \\frac{d\\dot{q}}{dz}(z;z_o ) & = 4\\pi d_a^2(z;z_o ) \\frac{dd_p}{dz } \\left(\\frac{1+z}{1+z_o}\\right)^{2-\\alpha}\\\\ & ~~~\\,\\quad\\times\\frac{\\chi(z;z_o)}{4\\pi d_l^2(z;z_o ) } \\tilde{\\lambda}_b\\left[z;l_m(z;z_o,\\dot{q}_{\\mathcal{q}}),l_m\\right]\\ , . \\end{aligned } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] these are shown , normalized by their integrated values , for @xmath373 ranging from @xmath432@xmath220 in figure [ f : nbds ] for @xmath423 .",
    "in addition we show an analogously defined characteristic luminosity , @xmath472 } {    \\tilde{\\phi}_b\\left[z;l_m(z;z_o,\\dot{q}_{\\mathcal{q}}),l_m\\right ] } \\ , . \\end{aligned } \\label{eq : leffb}\\ ] ]    the generic features of our static toy model are also apparent here .",
    "at all observer redshifts the heating rate is dominated by the nearest sources . at low @xmath373 , where @xmath473 is nearly flat , the number of objects is also heavily weighted towards nearby objects , well within the redshift at which @xmath201 .",
    "however , @xmath467 and @xmath468 evolve with observer redshift due to both , the intrinsic evolution of @xmath170 and the background universe . as a consequence , by @xmath474 the peak of @xmath467 has moved to the @xmath201 redshift , implying that @xmath402 ( where @xmath475 ) is not a particularly accurate estimate of the redshifts that contribute significantly to the heating .",
    "this is further supported by the high-@xmath373 behavior of @xmath467 , which once again is heavily weighted at redshifts inside of @xmath402 due to onset of the decline in the blazar population .",
    "the typical luminosities of objects responsible for the heating also evolve . at @xmath476 these are roughly @xmath154 , rising to @xmath477 by @xmath478 .",
    "we also compute the heating rate per logarithmic decade in luminosity : @xmath479 ( where @xmath480 is determined implicitly by @xmath481 ) shown in figure [ f : dqdl ] for a number of @xmath373 . at @xmath476 the distribution of heating rates is a relatively broad function of @xmath97 centered near @xmath482 . until @xmath478 ,",
    "as @xmath373 grows @xmath483 becomes increasingly peaked and centered upon increasingly larger luminosities .",
    "above @xmath478 this trend reverses , though the distribution of luminosities that contribute appreciably to the heating rate never becomes comparable to that in the present epoch .",
    "thus , generally it appears that the heating is due predominantly to nearby objects with luminosities comparable to @xmath153 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,",
