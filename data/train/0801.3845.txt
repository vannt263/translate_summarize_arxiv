    "galaxies occupy a special place in our quest for understanding the universe .",
    "they are large islands in a nearly empty space and contain most of the ordinary baryonic matter , stars and interstellar gas , that emits radiation and can thus be detected by astronomers@xmath3 .",
    "galaxies come essentially in two broad categories@xmath4 , those in which the luminous mass is arranged in a rotating disk of stars and gas , called disk galaxies or spiral galaxies because of the presence of spiral arms of gas and stars ( figure 1 ) , and those in which the luminous mass is distributed in a smooth , featureless spheroidal structure with little or no rotation , also known as elliptical galaxies ( figure 1 ) .",
    "disk galaxies have a radial light distribution @xmath5 that is well fit by a decaying exponential law@xmath6 , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a characteristic scale length ( @xmath9 kpc for typical spiral galaxies ) .",
    "indeed many disk galaxies contain also a spheroidal stellar component at their center , the stellar bulge , which has structural properties similar to an elliptical galaxies albeit being much smaller in size@xmath4 .",
    "both types of galaxies are known to contain dark matter , namely matter that is not traced by radiation . in disk galaxies dark matter",
    "clearly dominates over luminous matter by mass , as inferred from their high rotation speeds which requires the gravitational pull of a massive and extended halo of dark matter@xmath10 .",
    "we live in a galaxy of the first kind , the milky way .",
    "indeed disk galaxies are ubiquitous in the local universe , and also at the largest distances and earliest epochs at which the best ground and space - based telescopes have been able to study the morphology of galaxies reliably@xmath11 . only the most massive galaxies in the universe do not posess a disk component , while this becomes progressively more dominant compared to the spheroidal component as the mass of the galaxy decreases ( figure 2 ) .",
    "[ fig : feedback ]      the formation of disk galaxies is one of the major unsolved problems of modern astrophysics .",
    "the basic theoretical framework states that disk galaxies arise from the gravitational collapse of a rotating protogalactic cloud of gas within the gravitational potential well of the dark halo@xmath12 .",
    "the gas cools via radiative processes during the collapse and eventually settles in centrifugal equilibrium at the center of the halo potential well forming a rotationally supported gas disk provided that some angular momentum is retained during the collapse @xmath13 .",
    "these ideas were developed two decades ago and they still constitute the backbone of disk galaxy formation models @xmath14 . what has changed dramatically since then is the cosmological context in which such idea is applied , which reflects the remarkable progress that cosmology has undergone in the meantime .",
    "after two decades of active debate there is now one cosmological paradigm according to which the energy density of the universe is dominated by cold dark matter and a cosmological constant , while ordinary baryonic matter contributes only to a few percent level ( an even smaller contribution is yielded by neutrinos)@xmath15 .",
    "this model is supported by observations of the large scale mass distribution in the universe traced by galaxies themselves@xmath16 and by the power spectrum of density fluctuations inferred from the cosmic microwave background radiation@xmath15 .",
    "cold dark matter interacts only via gravity with itself and with ordinary baryonic matter , and is not subject to any dissipative force .",
    "the governing evolutionary equation for dark matter is the collisionless boltzmann equation that describes a zero - pressure fluid , also termed a collisionless fluid@xmath4 . in this model , called @xmath17cdm ( cdm stands for `` cold dark matter '' , while @xmath17 is the cosmological constant required to explain the observed acceleration of the universe ) structure forms hierarchically in a bottom - up fashion , starting from the amplification via gravitational instability of primordial small density fluctuations in the dark matter@xmath18 . because of the scale - free nature of gravity and the dissipationless nature of cold dark matter , in such a model one expects the formation of self - similar , ellipsoidal collapsed objects , dark matter halos , at all scales@xmath19 .",
    "the largest halos are the last to form@xmath20 . also , direct three - dimensional simulations of structure formation in a cdm universe predict that halos of any mass and size should contain a swarm of smaller halos , the so - called substructure@xmath21 , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "[ fig : feedback ]    the model predicts quantitatively the size and mass of the dark halo of a galaxy with a given measured rotational velocity ( the rotational velocity of stars and gas probes the depth of the galaxy gravitational potential well ) .",
    "for a galaxy like our own milky way , for example , its observed rotational velocity of @xmath22 km / s implies a halo mass of about @xmath23 solar masses and a halo radius of about @xmath24 kpc@xmath25 ( by comparison , the disk of our galaxy contains about @xmath26 solar masses of stars and about @xmath27 solar masses of gas@xmath4 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the growth of dark matter halos also predict that the radial density profiles of such halos diverge near the center and are well described by a power - law , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 being the density and @xmath30 the spherically averaged radius of the halo ) , with @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "since dark matter dominates by mass over ordinary baryonic matter , gas collapses within such halos , eventually forming a galaxy , because it is pulled inward by their gravitational attraction rather than collapsing due to its own gravity . in this scenario",
    "there is no such a thing as a galaxy forming in isolation , rather structure , both dark and baryonic , builds up via continous accretion and merging of smaller systems containing a mixture of dark and baryonic matter@xmath33 .",
    "this highly dynamical picture emerging from the current cosmology is the main difference compared to earlier attempts to study galaxy formation .",
    "halos gain their angular momentum by tidal torques due to asymmetries in the distribution of matter , and also by acquiring the angular momentum originally stored in their relative orbit as they come together and merge into a larger system@xmath34 .",
    "prevailing models have then assumed that baryons and dark matter start with the same specific angular momentum before the collapse begins since they are subject to the same tidal torques @xmath35 .",
    "[ fig : feedback ]      the modern tool used to study the hierarchical growth of structure driven by gravity and the concurrent collapse of baryons within dark halos is represented by three - dimensional computer simulations that solve the gravitational and hydrodynamical forces between parcels of gas and dark matter .",
    "we will discuss the methodology employed by such simulations in the next section .",
    "for now it suffices to say that in the most popular simulation method both the gas ( i.e. the baryonic component ) and the dark matter are represented by particles so that structures are discretized in mass and space .",
    "the evolutionary equations , such as the collisionless boltzmann equation for cold dark matter , the euler equation for baryonic matter ( baryonic matter is treated as an ideal gas ) and the poisson equation , which holds for both , are solved for such discrete representation of physical reality .",
    "available methods to discretize physical variables and governing equations are constructed in such a way that they should converge to the exact continuum solution for an infinite number of particles . as we will see in the next section , discretization itself , along with other aspects of the current methods ,",
    "can introduce spurious effects in the computer models .",
    "simulations take advantage of large parallel supercomputers in which hundreds of processing units are used simultaneously to compute the forces and advance the system to the next timestep",
    ".    one important prediction of simulations of a cdm universe is that halos have a rather universal value of the angular momentum ( per unit mass ) at any given epoch quite irrespective of their precise mass assembly history .",
    "this is parameterized via the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the total energy , mass and angular momentum of the dark halo ( @xmath40 is the gravitational constant ) .",
    "one can show that @xmath41 is proportional to the ratio between the rotational kinetic energy and the kinetic energy in disordered motions associated with the halo .",
    "halos have a universal distribution of spin parameters , which peaks at a value @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "simple spherical one - dimensional models that study disk formation in an isolated cdm halo ( namely a halo that does not interact or merge with other halos ) predict that the size of disks resulting from the infall and collapse of baryons matches the size of observed disks in galaxies very well@xmath44 .",
    "the models use mainly two inputs , both coming from cosmological simulations , the halo density profile , which is related to the gravitational pull that drives the gas collapse , and the initial specific angular momentum of gas as implied by the typical values of the spin parameter .",
    "they further assume that angular momentum is conserved during the collapse .",
    "hence this result is simple and remarkable at the same time ; it says that cdm halos have the right amount of angular momentum to form observed disk galaxies .",
    "for more than a decade researchers have tried to reproduce the latter result with fully three - dimensional computer simulations but have run into several problems .",
    "it was soon realized that , once the hypothesis of isolation is removed and hierarchical merging is accounted for , angular momentum can be lost by the gas to the dark matter due to a process known as dynamical friction@xmath45 . during mergers ,",
    "previously collapsed clumps of gas and dark matter fall into a larger dark halo and suffer a drag force as they move through the latter .",
    "the loss of angular momentum caused by the drag force , called `` dynamical friction '' , is more effective when the gas is distributed into cold and dense lumps rather than being smooth and extended@xmath46 .",
    "but gas is expected to be clumpy in a model with collisionless cold dark matter in which collapse can occur at all scales , and large halos grow by accreting smaller halos which bring their own dense collapsed gas . as a result , early simulations@xmath46 were obtaining improbable small disks with ten times less angular momentum than real ones .",
    "two types of solutions for this `` angular momentum problem '' have been considered since then .",
    "the first is very drastic and calls for revising the cosmological model itself .",
    "alternative models in which the dark matter has a non - negligible thermal velocity rather then being `` cold '' would produce collapsed systems only above a characteristic scale because the thermal jittering will tend to smear out short - wavelength density perturbations@xmath47 . these warm dark matter models ( wdm ) behave like cdm on large scale , thus maintaining its succesful features .",
    "the reduced clumpiness of dark matter halos in the wdm model implies that baryons are smoothly distributed rather than arranged in previously collapsed dense lumps when they fall into large galaxy - sized halos , and therefore lose less angular momentum by dynamical friction@xmath48 .",
    "the second , less exotic possibility , is that baryons do not just follow the merging hierarchy imposed by dark matter but somehow decouple from it and remain much smoother .",
    "this could happen if the thermal energy content of baryons was enough to resist gravitational collapse , at least up to some critical mass scale . this way",
    "a fraction of the gas that would have entered a halo in dense clumps within smaller halos would instead enter with a smooth distribution , perhaps avoiding catastrophic loss of angular momentum .",
    "various plausible astrophysical mechanisms can be responsible for increasing the thermal energy content of the baryons , for example the energy injection by supernovae explosions and the ambient radiation field produced by stars , accreting black holes or also external galaxies .",
    "there is , however , a third possibility .",
    "this is that the baryons clump excessively in computer simulations because the numerical methods adopted can introduce artificial loss of angular momentum .",
    "as we argue in this report , a solution lies probably in a combination of the latter two proposals , with no need of revising the standard cosmological structure formation model .",
    "[ fig : feedback ]    the next two sections will be devoted , respectively , to the role of numerical effects in disk formation simulations , and to the modeling of gas thermodynamics and star formation in the simulations .",
    "we will then show how the structure of simulated disks is affected by different models of thermodynamics and star formation .",
    "finally , we will summarize the current status of the field and the major problems that remain to be solved , including the puzzling origin of disk galaxies without a bulge .",
    "we will attempt to recall the most important contributions by the various groups actively involved in this field of research while at the same time covering in more detail some recent results of the research group to which the authors of this report belong .",
    "before discussing numerical effects in cosmological disk galaxy formation simulations we should keep in mind that until the time of writing this field of research has been dominated by one numerical method , smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph)@xmath49 , in which particles are tracers of average fluid quantities such as density , velocity and temperature associated with a finite volume of the fluid .",
    "the fluid is thus discretized by means of particles and the calculation of the fluid - dynamical equations is carried out in a lagrangian fashion . the euler equation for an inviscid ideal gas",
    "is solved rather than the more general navier - stokes equation .",
    "an artificial viscosity term is introduced in the hydrodynamical force equation and in the internal energy equation to compensate for some artifacts resulting from the discrete representation of the fluid equations , namely to avoid particle interpenetration and damp spurious oscillations in shocks@xmath50 .",
    "although it is introduced for these good reasons , artificial viscosity also causes some unwanted numerical effects , such as damping the angular momentum of the fluid .",
    "one of the reasons behind the dominance of the sph method in this field is that it couples naturally with the most efficient and accurate methods to compute gravitational forces in the fluid as well as in the collisionless dark matter component , the so called treecodes@xmath51 .",
    "treecodes are an approximate but fast and accurate way of solving the n - body problem@xmath52 . in treecodes gravitational forces between all particles , dark matter and baryons , are solved via a type of multipole expansion of the gravitational field which reduces to individual particle interactions only at short distances .",
    "eulerian techniques that solve gravity and the fluid equations on a fixed or adaptive grid have been less used in this field of research because they have been generally slower and less accurate when it comes to compute gravity .",
    "however , the scenario is changing rapidly with the appearance of several fast , parallel adaptive mesh refinement codes ( amr ) that are beginning to have an impact in studies of galaxy formation within a cosmological context@xmath53 . restricting ourselves to the current particle - based methods , we will now briefly review the most important numerical artifacts that can severely affect the angular momentum content and structure of disks forming in the simulations .",
    "many of the results that we will discuss in greater detail in this and in the following sections were obtained with the tree+sph code gasoline@xmath54 in simulations performed on large parallel supercomputers .      one major problem of all particle - based simulations , both hydrodynamical and collisionless , is numerical two - body heating .",
    "two - body heating is the spurious increase of kinetic or thermal energy of a particle representing gas , stars or dark matter due to a collision with another particle .",
    "particles behave as gravitating point masses and therefore can undergo strong gravitational accelerations in close encounters with consequent large transfers of momentum .",
    "such an effect is clearly an artifact of the discrete representation of a continuum by means of particles . for gas particles ,",
    "such spurious large accelerations can be partially compensated by pressure or artificial viscosity that tend to deflect particles as they approach one another . in order to partially overcome this problem for all types of particles",
    ", gravity is decreased at small distances thanks to the introduction of gravitational softening@xmath55 .",
    "softening the gravity field at scales of order the interparticle separation is consistent with the fact that individual particles should represent a fairly large sub - volume of the hydrodynamical fluid or collisionless continuum ( e.g. the dark matter component ) rather than real point - masses ( in typical simulation dark matter and baryonic particles can indeed weight @xmath56 solar masses ) however , in cosmological simulations of the cdm model dark matter particles are typically much heavier than gas and star particles because dark matter accounts for most of the mass . as a result massive dark matter particles can transfer significant kinetic energy during gravitational encounters with other particles despite the presence of gravitational softening .",
    "[ fig : feedback ]    this spurious transfer of energy in two - body encounters increases the kinetic energy in random motions because any component of the velocity can be boosted as a result of a given encounter .",
    "numerical experiments have shown that rotationally supported , thin stellar disks can be gradually degraded into a thick spheroidal distribution because the random velocity of the baryonic particles becomes increasingly more important compared to ordered rotation@xmath57 .",
    "if two - body heating is moderate and a recognizable disk component survives the angular momentum of the disk along the original axis of rotation still decreases as a result of the randomization of velocity vectors@xmath57 .",
    "hence two - body heating induces artificial angular momentum loss .",
    "gas particles suffer an increase of temperature as a result of two - body heating@xmath58 .",
    "this affects the radiative cooling efficiency of the gas because the cooling rate is a function of temperature@xmath58 .",
    "the increase of temperature occurs because the kinetic energy gained in two - body collisions is thermalized by artificial viscous dissipation .",
    "the only way to reduce these effects is to reduce the graininess of the mass distribution , which is only achieved by increasing the number of particles used in the simulation .",
    "this of course calls for more computing power .",
    "the reduction of spurious effects induced by two - body heating with increasing resolution has been tested systematically by means of toy - models that represent an isolated , already assembled galaxy@xmath59 .",
    "this type of models is idealized but allows to gain insight into the phenomenology of the much more complex cosmological simulations where many interacting objects are simultaneously modeled .",
    "such studies have indicated that @xmath60 particles are required in the dark matter of a single galaxy to keep the spurious kinetic energy increase to levels @xmath61 . in typical cosmological simulations",
    "many galaxies are followed at the same time and the latter becomes a tough resolution requirement .",
    "[ fig : feedback ]      when the resolution in the dark matter component is high enough to overcome two - body heating there are other numerical artifacts that can affect the formation and evolution of galaxies in the simulations , including the size and angular momentum of the disk .",
    "these are related to how well the gas component is resolved , namely on the number of gas particles . and",
    "is once more best studied using idealized numerical experiments with isolated galaxy models .",
    "these experiments show that gas particles can lose angular momentum as they collapse within the dark matter halo before they settle into a centrifugally supported orbit and join the disk@xmath62 .",
    "spurious angular momentum loss can happen for various reasons ; ( 1 ) artificial viscosity ; ( 2 ) the interaction between particles with significant temperature difference .",
    "the disk edge , where cold particles already belonging to the disk are close to hotter particles still in process of cooling and collapsing from the outer part of the halo .",
    "the cold particles suffer an artificial drag from the hot particles as a result of an erroneous estimate of the pressure gradient performed by the standard sph method @xmath63 , and shrink to a smaller radius ; ( 3 ) the disk can be quite asymmetric at low gas resolution and because of this suffers a strong gravitational torque from the surrounding halo , which then extracts its angular momentum .",
    "this latter effect is very subtle because disks might become asymmetric as a result of internal , physical evolution of the mass distribution .",
    "some observed galaxies indeed have asymmetries , such as bars and oval - shaped disks .",
    "nevertheless the asymmetry seen in the low - res simulations is artificial because it partially disappears as the resolution is increased ( figure 4 shows that the disk becomes rounder as the resolution is increased ) .",
    "the overall result of numerical experiments at varying resolution is that , while the amount of collapsed mass in the disk converges rapidly with resolution ( figure 5 ) , angular momentum loss becomes negligible only when the number of gas particles in an individual galaxy model approaches @xmath64 ( figure 5 ) .",
    "[ fig : feedback ]    once the disk has formed , artificial viscosity can continue to degrade angular momentum , especially near the center of disks where velocity gradients become very steep and the relative motion of the particles is poorly modeled . indeed without efficient heating by supernovae feedback or by other mechanisms , the inner disk always becomes very dense and loses angular momentum , even with millions of sph particles@xmath65 .",
    "gravitational instability in the gaseous or stellar component of the disk ( this arises when the disk becomes quite massive as more gas is accreted from the halo ) can also generate transport of angular momentum via non - axisymmetric structures such as bars and spiral arms@xmath66 ( see figure 4 ) , which are ubiquitous in observed galaxies@xmath67 .",
    "bars can transport angular momentum outward very efficiently@xmath66 .",
    "as a result they can flatten the disk density profile by pushing out the gas and/or the stars just outside the bar region@xmath68 .",
    "this affects the final disk size , with a tendency to increase it relative to the case where no bar forms .",
    "unfortunately , even this kind of angular momentum transport depends on resolution ; this time the spatial resolution of self - gravity , which is set by the gravitational softening length , has to be high enough to capture the wavelength of the non - axisymmetric modes of the density field responsible for bar formation@xmath65 .",
    "cosmological simulations of disk formation follow the nonlinear development of structure in a fairly large volume , of order @xmath69 mpc@xmath6 , which is much larger than the volume occupied by an individual galaxy - sized halo .",
    "the reason of this apparent redundancy is that the large scale tidal field needs to be included in order to properly compute the tidal torques that generate the angular momentum of the galaxy - sized halos .",
    "the larger volume implies more mass to sample and therefore implies that the resolution requirements indicated in the previous section will be much harder to meet . to overcome this problem",
    "a technique has been developed , and constantly improved in the last decade or so , to increase the resolution in a selected region within a large cosmological volume . this way the halo of a single galaxy can be resolved by up to a million dark matter and gas particles @xmath70 .",
    "this is the so - called renormalization technique ( figure 6 ) . in this technique ,",
    "the computational volume includes regions with varying mass and spatial resolution ; the masses of the particles , and therefore their mean separation , increase with the distance from the selected object , for example a single galaxy - sized halo .",
    "this way most of the particles are placed in the region of interest , optimizing the use of computer time .",
    "thanks to the latter technique , more evidence has been gathered on the effect of resolution directly in cosmological simulations .",
    "the analysis of the renormalized simulations confirms that disk size and angular momentum increases as the resolution of both the dark matter and baryonic component is increased .",
    "simulations with hundreds of thousands baryonic and dark matter particles do produce stellar disks whose size is indeed comparable with that of real galaxies @xmath71 .",
    "the most recent and highest resolution ( @xmath72 particles per galaxy ) of these simulations even produce high angular momentum gas disks that extend well beyond the stellar component , as observed in most spiral galaxies ( figure 8) .",
    "however , a spheroidal bulge component always forms at the center of the galaxy ( figure 7 , 8 , 9 ) the bulge comprises low angular momentum material brought by several mergers early in the assembly history of the system@xmath73 .",
    "it is too dense and massive compared to that seen in typical disk galaxies . on the other end ,",
    "such a dense and massive bulge is not very different from that of at least _ some _ galaxies , such as the closest nearby spiral galaxy , andromeda .",
    "it is conceivable that the high density and large mass of the bulge might be at least partially caused by artificial loss of angular momentum during the early stages of galaxy assembly .",
    "in fact , even in the highest resolution renormalized simulations the progenitors of the final galaxy have only a few thousand particles when the bulge forms , ten billion years before the present epoch@xmath74 , a resolution well below that recommended by numerical experiments with isolated galaxies@xmath65 .",
    "[ fig : feedback ]    it is encouraging that the central concentration of mass , like the disk size , also decreases as the resolution is increased .",
    "this can be quantified by measuring the rotational velocity of the baryonic material as a function of radius , hence deriving the `` rotation curves '' that observational astronomers use to probe the dynamics of real galaxies ( figure 7 ) .",
    "the degree of rotation is determined by the depth of the gravitational potential well ; assuming spherical symmetry , and that all the kinetic energy of the baryons is in rotational form , the rotational velocity at any given radius in the galaxy will be given by @xmath75 ( @xmath38 is the mass , @xmath76 is the radius and @xmath40 is the gravitational constant ) .",
    "@xmath77 tends to increase towards the center if a massive central bulge component is present .",
    "likewise , it becomes flatter near the center as the mass of the central bulge diminishes .",
    "figure 7 shows the rotation curves obtained by two different groups using two different numerical codes@xmath78 .",
    "it demonstrates that the rotational velocity decreases with increasing mass resolution , as expected if the spurious angular momentum loss of the baryonic material decreases with increasing resolution . from the figure it appears that the rotation curve is also affected by other factors , namely the presence or absence of heating by supernovae feedback that will be discussed in the next section .",
    "stronger heating will in fact counterbalance gas cooling ; it will thus reduce the amount of cold gas that collapses to the center of the progenitor halos forming the stars that will be later incorporated into the bulge .",
    "despite the large amount of dark matter that they contain , disk galaxies are identified via their baryonic component , namely gas and stars .",
    "there is general consensus that the thermodynamics of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , the gaseous component in the disks of galaxies , is a crucial aspect of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "stars indeed form out of the ism , being the end result of the gravitational collapse of the densest regions of clouds made of molecular gas .",
    "the interstellar medium in our galaxy is multi - phase@xmath79 .",
    "a minimal ingredient of a realistic model of the ism should account for the four main phases found in the disk of a galaxy , which , in order of increasing density , are the the warm ionized medium ( wim , @xmath80 atoms / cm@xmath6 , @xmath82 k ) , the warm neutral medium ( wnm , @xmath80 atoms / cm@xmath6 , @xmath82 k ) , the cold neutral medium ( cnm , @xmath83 atoms / cm@xmath6 , @xmath84 k which comprises clouds of atomic hydrogen ) and the cold molecular phase ( mostly clouds of molecular hydrogen , @xmath85 atoms / cm@xmath6 , @xmath86 k ) , with the first three phases being in approximate pressure equilibrium@xmath79 .",
    "a hotter , diffuse phase also surrounds the disk ( hot intercloud medium , @xmath87 atoms / cm@xmath6 , @xmath88 k ) and is likely constantly fed by supernovae explosions that inject large quantities of thermal energy and momentum in the ism .",
    "the different phases are the result of thermal balance between radiative heating and cooling at different densities and , at the same time , thermal instability ( perhaps coupled with gravitational instability ) that determines the emergence of the two densest phases , the cnm and the molecular phase@xmath79 .",
    "molecular gas is formed and destroyed via a number of microscopic interactions involving ions , atoms and catalysis on dust grains .",
    "these processes become biased towards the formation rather than towards the destruction of molecular hydrogen only at densities @xmath89 atoms / cm@xmath6 .",
    "a great deal of energy in the interstellar medium is non - thermal ; this turbulent energy , which is essentially observed as random gas motions of clouds and inside clouds is supersonic , being several times larger than the thermal energy at the scale of giant molecular complexes .",
    "turbulent kinetic energy is thought to be the main agent that supports the largest molecular clouds ( @xmath60 solar masses ) against global collapse @xmath90 .",
    "the partial suppression of gravitational collapse owing to turbulent support also explains the low efficiency of star formation in our galaxy ( only a few percent of the molecular gas mass present in the milky way appears to be involved in forming stars ) .",
    "magnetic fields also play an important role in resisting gravitational collapse at scales larger than @xmath91 pc , while below this scale ambipolar diffusion and ohmic dissipation give way yield to the action of gravity@xmath79 .",
    "12truecm    supernovae explosions are a likely driver of ism turbulence since the blast - waves generated by them can transport energy and momentum to scales as large as several hundred parsecs , perhaps up to kiloparsecs .",
    "this gives rise to dramatic outflows of gas above the disk plane in galaxies that are actively forming stars ( figure 10 ) .",
    "other drivers of turbulence in the ism are probably operating , both at small scales , for example protostellar outflows , and at large scales , such as spiral waves generated by the large scale gravitational instability of the galactic disk at scales of 1 kpc and above .",
    "magnetic fields probably also play a role since they can generate turbulence via magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) waves@xmath79 .",
    "this brief summary highlights the complexity of the ism physics .",
    "things are complicated even further by the fact that the main mechanism of molecular cloud formation is still unclear , and so are the details of how molecular cores collapse into stars .",
    "[ fig : feedback ]      how can we model the complex phenomenology of the ism in large scale cosmological galaxy formation simulations ?",
    "this has always been a major problem because the multi - phase structure of the ism is also multi - scale , going from kpc scales , where most of the gas is ionized , to scales of tens of parsecs and below , where most of the gas is molecular , with the density changing by about 8 orders of magnitude across the different phases .",
    "cosmological simulations follow the formation of galaxies in a volume of at least several tens of mpc because , as we explained in section 2.4 , the generation of angular momentum and other aspects of structure formation require that the large scale gravitational field is properly modeled .",
    "this calls for resolving seven orders of magnitude in length scales , and about ten orders of magnitude in density , going from tens of mpc scales and densities of @xmath92 atoms / cm@xmath6 to parsec scales and densities @xmath93 atoms / cm@xmath6 .",
    "this can only get worse if we aim at following directly the process of star formation ; indeed stars form from the collapse of the densest region of molecular clouds , the so called cores , at scales of @xmath94 pc@xmath79 .",
    "currently , limitations in computer power as well as in the efficiency of available algorithms , make it possible to resolve at best scales of 100 pc in cosmological simulations ( very recent simulations have been able to achieve a resolution of less than @xmath69 pc , but they can only cover the first few billion years of evolution@xmath95 ) .",
    "simulations with resolution adequate to follow directly molecular clouds , interstellar turbulence and star formation do exist , but are restricted to studying an isolated galaxy@xmath96 or a small region of a single galaxy @xmath97 .",
    "detailed numerical models of the effects of supernovae explosions also exist , but again they are restricted to a small volume of the ism@xmath98 . for this reasons , the past decade or",
    "so has seen a lot of research activity being focused on designing the so called `` sub - grid '' models for simulations .",
    "these models essentially contain a phenomenological description of the processes occurring below the smallest scale resolved in the simulation .",
    "the phenomenological model is incorporated into the same parallel codes that compute gravity and hydrodynamics as well as radiative heating and cooling .",
    "sub - grid models , being phenomenological , inevitably contain some free parameters that are tuned to reproduce important observables such as the typical star formation rate for a galaxy of a given mass , namely how much gas is turned into stars over a given amount of time .",
    "the description of star formation is fully sub - grid , while the thermodynamics of the ism is partially sub - grid .",
    "what do we mean by `` partially '' subgrid ?",
    "one example is the following ; radiative cooling is directly modeled for the range of densities accessible to the simulations while its effect below the grid is only implicitly accounted for in a phenomenological way . since simulations typically lack resolution below a few hundred parsecs this sets a maximum density that the simulation can resolve of order 0.1 atoms / cm@xmath6 , which is close to the density of the wnm ( @xmath82 k ) .",
    "for this reason cooling processes that are important below @xmath99 k are usually neglected .",
    "likewise , radiative heating is partially determined by the thermal and turbulent energy injection from supernovae explosions and/or from accreting massive black holes at the center of galaxies , both processes being not directly resolved , but also by the ultraviolet interstellar or intergalactic radiation background produced by stars , or by cosmic - ray and x - ray heating originating from various astrophysical sources , which can be directly included as constant heating terms in the internal energy equation without the need of a sub - grid model .",
    "finally , interstellar turbulence can not be resolved in galaxy formation simulations , nor it is accounted for in the sub - grid models . in what follows",
    "we will recall the main features of the sub - grid models widely used in galaxy formation simulations , pointing out their differences .",
    "first we will cover the star formation recipes and then sub - grid thermodynamics .",
    "star formation models used by different groups are very similar in essence .",
    "they describe the conversion of gas into stars@xmath100 a given star particle , once created , will represent a star cluster rather than a single star because of the limited mass resolution in the simulations .",
    "sub - grid models in this context are all based on the idea that stars can form only when the gas climbs above some threshold density@xmath100 .",
    "this density is usually taken to be @xmath91 atoms / cm@xmath6 .",
    "indeed this is the typical density of the wnm , and is 6 - 7 orders of magnitude lower than the density of dense , star forming molecular cloud cores despite being a relatively high density in the context of simulations that model a large cosmological volume .",
    "once the density of a gas parcel is above the latter threshold stars are formed over a timescale comparable to the local dynamical time , as expected from the fact that stars emerge from the gravitational collapse of dense gas@xmath100 the amount of stars formed over such a time span is regulated by an efficiency parameter that can be tuned to match observed star formation rates .",
    "this efficiency parameter crudely mimics the effect of unresolved physical processes that regulate the conversion of gas into stars . among the latter , the formation and destruction rates of molecular hydrogen that determines how much gas is available in the star - forming dense molecular phase , and the effect of turbulence , magnetic fields , protostellar outflows and all those processes that determine how efficient is star formation within single clouds .",
    "different algorithms then are distinguished by ( 1 ) how they implement additional conditions , based on e.g. the velocity field or temperature of the gas , as pre - requisites for star formation , and by ( 2 ) the details of the method used to convert a single gas particle into a collisionless star particle .    despite various differences , all the sub - grid star formation recipes designed so far fare quite well at reproducing the slope of the observed correlation between the average star formation rate and gas density , the so called schmidt - kennicutt law@xmath101 .",
    "the latter relation is global in nature since it looks at the total amount of stars formed in an entire galaxy , and is one of the most fundamental observables that simulations use as a benchmark for their validity . in more detail ,",
    "the schmidt - kennicutt law states that the density of cold neutral gas ( cnm ) , mostly atomic hydrogen , correlates with the global star formation rate .",
    "this is a non trivial correlation since in reality it is only the molecular phase that is directly related to the production of stars . on the other end , somehow the molecular phase stems from the neutral atomic phase once this is able to achieve a high enough density .",
    "the success of simple sub - grid recipes in reproducing the schmidt - kennicutt law is thus probably related to the fact that they are all based on a threshold gas density and a dynamical timescale@xmath102 .",
    "both numbers are determined by how the gas density evolves with time ; this in turn is likely controlled by the large ( kpc ) scale gravitational instability in galactic disks , which is resolved in the simulations .    nevertheless , for low mass galaxies large deviations from the kennicutt relation occur , and such deviations are also evident in single star forming regions of well studied nearby galaxies@xmath103 .",
    "in order to reproduce the latter , more complex observational scenario high resolution simulations of galaxies have begun to include a sub - grid description of the molecular phase starting from the cnm instead of having to bridge all over from the wim and wnm to stars@xmath104 .",
    "these first attempts show that a model that incorporates the formation and destruction of molecular hydrogen as a function of density and ambient temperature allows to reproduce detailed correlations between the local star formation rate and the local density of molecular gas as traced by various molecular tracers in observations of individual galaxies@xmath103 .",
    "these recent models produce realistic results for the star formation properties of galaxies of varying masses@xmath105 , despite the fact that heating by supernovae explosions is neglected .",
    "they provide a way to follow the molecular gas fraction when the resolution is not high enough to model molecular gas formation directly by using the gas at cnm densities as a proxy for the amount of molecular gas@xmath106 .",
    "for this procedure to be sensible the number of gas particles must of course be high enough to allow resolving the density of the cnm ( @xmath107 atoms / cm@xmath6 ) .",

    "eventually the kinetic energy added to the gas in kinetic feedback is also thermalized and radiated away , but on a longer timescale . as a result , kinetic feedback is more effective at increasing the internal energy of the gas compared to thermal feedback ; gas cooling is counteracted more efficiently , and in cosmological simulations less gas ends up in dense lumps .",
    "overall the gas component loses less angular momentum while merging , resulting ultimately in larger disks@xmath112 .",

    "switching off heating by supernovae feedback produces a softer equation of state that approaches the isothermal regime ( as expected based on the efficient cooling rate at the density and temperatures typical of galactic disks ) . since the description of the interstellar medium given by the effective equation of state is statistical in nature the two phases are implicitly assumed to be in pressure equilibrium locally , which is not the case in the blast - wave feedback model .",

    "the bar transfers angular momentum outward and mass inward , leading to a steep stellar density profile in the center and a much shallower profile in the outer part . when a standard star formation recipe is included in the simulation the bar becomes mostly stellar because gas is efficiently converted into stars , and undergoes another form of gravitational instability in the vertical direction , known as `` buckling instability''@xmath145 .",

    "central stellar concentrations of comparable masses , known as stellar nuclei , are seen in some bulgeless galaxies but their typical sizes are ten times smaller , so that they do not affect the surface density profile at scales of hundreds of parsecs@xmath148 . moreover , a large fraction of bulgeless galaxies does not have such nuclei and shows a stellar exponential profile across several kiloparsecs in radius .",
    "this is currently one of the most important problems of disk formation .",
    "the location of a parcel of gas in the disk after the collapse , namely how close to the center such a parcel settles into centrifugal equilibrium , determines the gas density profile , which in turn sets the stellar density profile via the conversion of gas into stars .",
    "such location is determined by the combined action of gravity , pressure and rotational support .",
    "the presence of a dense concentration in the simulations might suggest a `` second '' angular momentum problem at small scales .",
    "it is a second problem because it occurs even when the total spurious angular momentum loss in the disk is down to a few percent thanks to high resolution@xmath65 . as we mentioned in section 2 , numerical loss of angular momentum near the center of the potential",
    "is hard to tackle even at high resolution , and might be playing a role in this case .",
    "however , this can not be the only issue .",
    "in fact , one dimensional spherical numerical models of gas collapse in cuspy cdm halos that impose angular momentum conservation also predict that same inner upturn of the stellar density profile@xmath149 .",
    "this seems to be a result of how the gas settles in centrifugal equilibrium in the cuspy potential of a cdm halo@xmath150 .",
    "the upturn in the profile is caused by the collapse of the innermost shells of the gas distribution , and these are the ones that collapse first because they have the shortest free - fall time .",
    "one possibility to reconcile the simulations with the observations would be to alter the halo potential ",
    "if the halo has finite density core its potential well would be shallower and the gas would likely satisfy the the centrifugal equilibrium condition further out from the center , avoiding the formation of the dense central clump .",
    "this of course would require to invoke some mechanism that modifies the halo profiles predicted by the cdm simulations , or even to resort to an alternative cosmological model .",
    "both options should not be disregarded but one may wonder whether such a drastic change of scenario is really required .",
    "since pressure also plays a role in deciding the radius at which gas comes into centrifugal equilibrium , as well as its distance above and below the plane , hence ultimately its mass distribution , the answer could lie in the details of gas thermodynamics during disk assembly .    here",
    "we present preliminary results suggesting that the model assumed for energy feedback in the disk has a big impact on the slope of the stellar density profile .",
    "we recomputed the same disk formation models presented in already published work@xmath65 using the blast - wave feedback model ( 40% of the energy of the supernovae explosions is damped to the gas in this particular simulation ) .",
    "the gas disk has an irregular and flocculent structure without a significant central concentration , at odds with the simulation without feedback ( figure 13 ) .",
    "the stellar disk has a lower average density and its surface density profile has a much flatter slope compared to the case without feedback ( figure 14 ) and shows a milder upturn at small scales ; what is most important , however , is that such upturn appears only after a couple of gyrs of evolution .",
    "therefore it is related to the internal evolution of the disk ( spurious and/or physical ) rather than being caused by the initial conditions ( i.e. by gas collapse in a cuspy halo profile ) .",
    "10truecm    a single exponential curve can reproduce the slope of most of the stellar mass distribution , which clearly was not the case with thermal feedback ( see figure 14 ) .",
    "so now the problem has shifted from forming a pure exponential profile to preserving it for a timescale long enough , i.e. many gyrs , to explain why we observe many pure exponential disks in the local universe .",
    "the fact that the stellar profile becomes closer to exponential with using blast - wave feedback is not trivially related to the higher pressure support in the gas disk produced by the supernovae explosions .",
    "indeed the simulations that we previously published@xmath65 included a minimum temperature below which the gas was not allowed to cool in order to crudely mimic the heating due to feedback .",
    "such temperature floor was comparable to the mean temperature of the gas in the blast - wave feedback simulation ( @xmath151 k ) .",
    "after all , the models with a temperature floor can explain observed trends of increasing thickness of the disk , lowered star formation efficiency and higher gas fractions in the disk with decreasing galaxy mass due to the enhanced pressure support@xmath152 .    however , while the temperature floor is by construction the same everywhere in the disk , the blast - wave feedback produces a two - phase medium such that density , pressure and temperature can have significant local variations ( see previous section ) .",
    "indeed the morphological appearances of the two disks are very different ( see figure 13 ) , with the blast - wave model producing a much more flocculent and irregular gas disk which resembles more closely that of late - type low mass galaxies such as the nearby large magellanic cloud@xmath124 .",
    "the bubbles produced by supernovae literally punch holes in the disk and push the neighboring cold gas squeezing it into dense filaments , where star formation can go on .",
    "the fact that the cold gas is confined to filaments and can not fill a large volume naturally avoids the formation of large dense clumps of gas , possibly explaining why the blast - wave feedback is more effective at suppressing the upturn of the surface density profile compared to a model with a uniform temperature floor .",
    "cosmological simulations adopting the model of the effective equation of state@xmath153 were also able to produce a disk galaxy having a nearly exponential profile without a central dense clump@xmath134 but the stellar disk was too thick and was rotating too slowly in the central few kiloparsecs compared to typical disk - dominated galaxies - the inner disk was deficient in specific angular momentum by a factor of 2 .",
    "this suggests that the pressurization of the interstellar medium produced by this model , which determines the vertical structure of the disk , might be excessive and might disfavour the formation of a realistic thin disk .",
    "these results reinforce the idea that the solution of the exponential disk profiles lies in a correct model of the thermodynamics of the interstellar medium and star formation rather than in drastic modifications of the underlying cosmological model .",
    "when applied to galaxies of a range of masses forming in a cosmological simulation the blast - wave feedback model allows to improve significantly the match with real galaxies in at least three ways compared to the case in which a simple thermal feedback model is used@xmath154 :    \\(1 ) at a given resolution it produces more extended disks with a smaller bulge ( although increasing the mass resolution has the strongest effect in reducing the bulge - to - disk mass ratio ) , in line with what was found for isolated collapse experiments ( figure 9 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) it produces automatically the right trend of star formation histories with galaxy mass ( figure 15 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) it produces galaxies that lie close to the observed correlation between rotational velocity of the disk and luminosity of the galaxy , also known as tully - fisher relation@xmath155 .",
    "\\(4 ) it allows to predict correctly the stellar mass -metallicity relation@xmath156 measured in local galaxies@xmath157 and at @xmath158@xmath159 , according to which more massive galaxies are also more metal rich ( figure 15 ) .",
    "the tully - fisher relation is directly connected with the most important aspects of galaxy formation@xmath160 .",
    "namely the amount of gas which forms stars and thus determines the luminosity of the galaxy , and the depth of the gravitational potential well , which determines the magnitude of rotation . in the past numerical simulations have failed to reproduce this relation .",
    "not surprisingly , the only other work in which simulated galaxies were falling close to the observed tully - fisher is the same work in which an exponential , disk - dominated galaxy was obtained@xmath134 . in the latter work the authors also obtained a nearly flat rotation curve for one of their simulated galaxies thanks to the absence of a dense and massive bulge .",
    "this single rotation curve was flatter than that of the galaxies in @xmath74 , although a new series of blast - wave feedback simulations , which consider a larger variety of initial conditions , also includes some objects with nearly flat rotation curves ( governato et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "a flat rotation curve with a very small bulge component is also obtained in recent amr simulations that , thanks to a resolution better than @xmath69 pc , are able to follow directly the dynamics and thermodynamics of bubbles produced by supernovae explosions , although the calculation is carried out only until @xmath161 .    regarding the third point , the trend between star formation history and galaxy mass is such that lower mass galaxies have progressively more extended star formation histories , namely a larger fraction of their stars forms at progressively later epochs .",
    "this is the observed `` downsizing '' of galaxies , namely the fact that smaller galaxies appear to have formed more recently@xmath162 .",
    "taken at face value , for years downsizing has been considered as a fundamental problem of the cold dark matter model , which predicts that structure formation proceeds from small to large halos in a bottom - up fashion .",
    "the blast - wave feedback model has allowed to resolve this discrepancy by decoupling the evolutionary timescale of the baryonic component from that of the dark matter component owing to their different energetics ; in low mass galaxies gas is less gravitationally bound to the halos and can thus be more dramatically affected by the heating due to supernovae explosions@xmath163 , with the result that star formation is quenched and more gas is available at later epochs to keep forming stars .",
    "in other words , the star formation in small galaxies is diluted over a much longer time span , so that when their light is measured they appear young today despite the fact that their halos assembled early .",
    "dilution also means a lower average star formation rate relative to large galaxies ( figure 15 ) .",
    "another well established observational distinction between low mass and high mass galaxies .",
    "a lower average star formation rate also implies that at the current epoch low mass galaxies should be more gas rich relative to high mass galaxies .",
    "this happens in the simulations@xmath74 and is in agreement with the observed trend of increasing gas fraction towards decreasing galaxy mass@xmath164 .",
    "the gas fractions in the blast - wave feedback runs are actually significantly higher than in models that use a purely thermal feedback .",
    "realistic gas fractions and star formation rates are also obtained with simulations employing the effective equation of state@xmath134 .",
    "unfortunately , a direct and systematic comparison between the latter model and the blast - wave feedback model is still missing .",
    "therefore at present it is unclear which of the two models performs best against a large set of properties measured for real disk galaxies , especially it is unknown how the two models compare when they are used in cosmological simulations starting with identical initial conditions .",
    "such a comparison would certainly be of great benefit in order to ponder in a critical way the conceptual modeling behind the two different methods .",
    "finally , the fact that cosmological simulations with blast - wave feedback reproduce the observed stellar mass - metallicity relation@xmath156 suggests that this kind of sub - grid model not only provides a reasonable description of the star formation process but also of the associated metal enrichment ( in the model metals are liberated when supernovae type i and type ii explode , as well as via stellar winds@xmath124 ) and mixing processes in galaxies .",
    "it is important to note that with this model of feedback galaxies with a rotational velocity @xmath165 km / s do not experience major gas `` blowouts '' and are able to retain a relatively large gas fraction within their virial radius .",
    "rather supernovae feedback makes star formation relatively inefficient in small galaxies , making them gas rich and more metal poor , as the metals produced in stellar explosions are diluted over a larger gas fraction .",
    "this result opens the door to the possibility of using the blast - wave feedback model to study the photometric properties of very high redshift galaxies , where the poorly known amount of metals in the gas component can strongly affect their observational properties .",
    "it is fair to say that the progress achieved by several groups in simulating galaxy formation is quite remarkable .",
    "just a decade ago the spatial resolution of cosmological simulations barely reached a kiloparsec , which corresponds to the characteristic exponential scale length of galactic disks .",
    "today simulations are approaching a resolution better than a hundred parsecs , an improvement of more than an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore we have moved from a situation in which the process of disk galaxy formation was barely within the reach of cosmological calculations to a situation in which the simulations can effectively target such process . at the same time , sub - grid models of those astrophysical mechanisms that determine the thermodynamics of the interstellar medium , and consequently the process of star formation , are becoming increasingly more realistic .",
    "furthermore , as the resolution of simulations increases further we might enter a regime in which the multi - phase ism and the bulk effect of supernovae explosions can be modeled directly rather than being incorporated in a sub - grid fashion .",
    "indeed the most recent ( amr ) cosmological simulations at the time of writing suggest that the many assumption of sub - grid models cease to be required if a resolution of at least @xmath69 pc can be achieved@xmath95 .",
    "finally , we have gained a much better understanding of the various numerical effects that can dramatically affect the results of the simulations and render a comparison with observed galaxies quite meaningless .    yet , despite the tremendous improvement in numerical resolution , cosmological simulations are still affected by resolution issues in the early phase of galaxy assembly , namely during the fist few billion years of evolution . the latter phase is characterized by frequent mergers ( the merger rate of dark halos declines dramatically after @xmath166 , about 8 billion years ago , in the @xmath17cdm model ) and is responsible for the build up of the central region of galaxies , including their bulge@xmath167 .",
    "the central region of a virialized object indeed assembles earlier because it corresponds to the peak of the local density field , which becomes gravitationally unstable and collapses earlier than the the outer , lower density regions .",
    "the collapse of the central region is of course lumpy ; many small halos , each of them possibly already hosting a previously assembled small galaxy , come together and merge . even in the best cosmological simulations currently available ,",
    "these `` primordial '' halos are poorly resolved due to their small masses . each object",
    "being resolved by only a few tens of thousand particles , spurious angular momentum loss , two - body heating and other numerical effects are particularly severe@xmath168 .",
    "this lack of resolution at early times probably explains why the same simulations that are finally producing disks with realistic structural properties @xmath169 still exhibit central regions with an excess of low angular momentum material and an ubiquitous massive , dense spheroidal bulge component .",
    "since bulgeless galaxies are abundant in the present - day universe as well as several billions of years ago@xmath170 , here we are facing a major problem .",
    "the ubiquitous bulge component in simulated galaxies triggers the following question;can a disk galaxy without a bulge ever be formed in a @xmath17cdm universe ? answering this question using the current simulations seems a daunting task .",
    "the situation becomes even worse if we consider that halos with larger angular momentum , thus favourable to the formation of large , dominant disks , are also those that are more prone to form a massive bulge because they undergo a larger number of major mergers@xmath171 .",
    "if the main problem is resolution during the early phase of structure formation , one could hope to minimize numerical loss of angular momentum by increasing the resolution further .",
    "however , due to the scale - free nature of collapse in a cold dark matter universe , when the mass resolution is increased not only previously resolved halos are sampled by more particles , but also new , previously unresolved halos appear that are once again modeled with too few particles .",
    "in other words , in cold dark matter simulations of any resolution there will always be some epoch at which most lumps of dark matter and baryons become small enough to be poorly resolved , thus biasing the angular momentum content of the final galaxy . the latter argument",
    ", however , strictly applies only to dark matter .",
    "as we have seen , mechanisms such as supernovae feedback can decouple the collapse history of baryons from that of the dark matter .",
    "in addition , as the mass of the progenitor lumps decreases there is another important process that can lead to a significant decoupling . between one and five billion years after the big bang , namely between @xmath172 and @xmath166 , both the formation rate of stars in galaxies and the mass growth of supermassive black holes that shine as quasars at the center of them reach their peak , producing so much ultraviolet radiation to ionize most of the hydrogen in the universe@xmath173 .",
    "this ubiquitous ultraviolet radiation , known as the photoionizing background , keeps the intergalactic gas at a temperature exceeding @xmath127 k , suppressing the collapse of baryons in halos with masses below @xmath174 solar masses ( deeper potential wells are needed to confine gas that can not cool below @xmath127 k)@xmath175 .",
    "the ionizing background also causes photoevaporation of gas that has previously collapsed in such small halos@xmath176 .",
    "the net result is that halos with masses below @xmath174 solar masses become nearly empty of baryons during this epoch , retaining only the stars that were formed before the rise of the ultraviolet background ; when they merge , they bring very little baryonic mass and thus should contribute little to the formation of bulges .",
    "interestingly , galaxies with little or no bulge are mostly found among the lowest mass disk galaxies ( figure 2 ) , which were formed by the hierarchical merging of smaller lumps , as expected if the photoionizing background played a key role in suppressing bulge formation early on .",
    "recent cosmological simulations by the major groups involved in this area of research include the effect of the photoionizing background@xmath177 .",
    "the inclusion of the ultraviolet background in the picture introduces a scale , @xmath178 solar masses , in an otherwise scale - free structure formation model .",
    "this suggests that simulations should try to obey the following resolution requirement in order to avoid spurious angular momentum loss during the early phase of galaxy formation ; the smallest baryon - rich lumps , namely those with masses @xmath179 solar masses , should be resolved by about a million sph particles , and a few @xmath180 dark matter particles , as suggested by resolution studies@xmath181 .",
    "the latter resolution requirement translates into an sph particle mass of about @xmath182 solar masses , a couple of orders of magnitude higher than that currently achieved in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation@xmath74 .",
    "provided that resolution issues are solved , a conceptual problem still remains .",
    "it is a common assumption , supported by a large number of detailed three - dimensional simulations , that mergers between nearly equal mass disk - dominated galaxies would produce a spheroidal , bulge - dominated system@xmath183 .",
    "these nearly equal - mass mergers are frequent in hierarchical assembly , especially early on .",
    "a bulgeless galaxy should only arise if the last major merger occurs when the cosmic ultraviolet flux is still high , at @xmath184 , i.e. more than ten billions of years ago , and involves lumps small enough to be nearly devoid of baryons . major mergers between more massive lumps , that were barely affected by the ultraviolet flux , and/or occurring later , when the flux has declined ,",
    "will inevitably build a bulge ; the bulge will only become less concentrated as the resolution increases but will not disappear .",
    "this means that forming bulgeless galaxies in @xmath17cdm needs a requirement on the merging history in addition to that on the resolution@xmath185 .",
    "the fact that major mergers cease to be common after @xmath186 is quite encouraging in this respect .",
    "this figure becomes even more favourable , at least qualitatively , for halos with masses below that of the milky way halo , which would be consistent with the fact that most bulgeless galaxies are of low mass ( figure 2 ) .",
    "yet , at the moment it is unclear how these figures on halo merger rates can be compared quantitatively with the fraction of bulgeless galaxies seen both today and at @xmath166 in large galaxy surveys such as cosmos@xmath11 .",
    "the final structure of the galaxy is strongly dependent on its merging history not only because the latter contributes to determine its bulge - to - disk ratio but also because it affects the structure of the disk itself@xmath187 .",
    "after the last major merger the galaxy grows via accretion of smaller lumps of dark matter and baryons ( usually referred to as satellites ) and gas accretion from the hot gas cooling from the halo .",
    "we could name this second phase `` oligarchic growth '' , using a terminology well known in the field of planet formation , where a similar switch between modes of growth occurs in the case of colliding km - sized rocky bodies ( planetesimals ) .",
    "bulgeless galaxies should arise in those systems that switch to `` oligarchic growth '' earlier than the rest of the galaxy population based on our previous argument .",
    "however this simple prediction is complicated by the fact that a bulge could also arise during the `` oligarchic growth '' phase as a result of bar formation and subsequent buckling@xmath68 .",
    "therefore , one should require that the fraction of @xmath17cdm halos that switch to `` oligarchic growth '' at high redshift be comfortably larger than the observed fraction of bulgeless disk galaxies since some of them might have formed their bulge later via internal evolution .",
    "it is important to consider the possibility that the accepted assumption that mergers produce bulge - like , spheroidal components might not be true in general .",
    "recently , it has been shown that if the disks of two galaxies contain a lot of gas a large disk can be produced as a result of the merger@xmath188 this is because the gas dissipates and settles into centrifugal equilibrium at fairly large radii owing to the angular momentum originally locked in the orbital motion of the two galaxies .",
    "the disk re - growth might actually increase the disk - to - bulge ratio provided that there is sufficient gas in the original galaxies , but this still needs to be quantified .",
    "now , interestingly galaxies appear to become more gas rich at earlier times and for lower masses .",
    "it is thus plausible that at early times galaxies underwent several gas - rich mergers that contributed to building a disk more than to forming a bulge . as a consequence",
    ", it seems relevant to carry out simulations that are very accurate in the early phase of galaxy assembly even if this prevents from following the formation of the galaxy until the present epoch ( callegari , mayer et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , mergers are not the only way by which a central mass concentration can arise in galaxies .",
    "the non - cosmological simulations also exhibit a profile that becomes steeper than exponential towards the center , although models with blast - wave feedback look very promising as fas as limiting the growth of the central density enhancement .",
    "we note , however , that the initial gas density and angular momentum distributions of the isolated models are poorly constrained .",
    "testing different initial conditions can teach us about the physical conditions of the gaseous halo needed in order to be consistent with observations .",
    "preliminary simulations ( kaufmann et al . in preparation ) show that an initial gas density profile with a core , and thus a high initial entropy ( as expected in scenarios in which some non specified primordial heating mechanism , perhaps feedback by massive central black holes , raised the entropy of the gas already collapsed in halos@xmath189 ) , can lead to disk masses , atomic hydrogen distribution and x - ray emission in better agreement with observations compared to the case in which the gas density follows the cuspy dark matter profile . comparing the prediction of simulations to observations in different wavelengths , such as radio wavelengths at which the atomic hydrogen is revealed , and x",
    "- rays by means of which the hot gas in the halo can be detected , could be a powerful tool to constrain the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "there are some aspects of the galaxy formation process that we have not covered in this report and that might have an impact on the problem of disk formation and , in particular , on the origin of bulgeless galaxies . first , gas accretion seems to occur in a different fashion for large and small galaxies .",
    "small galaxies mostly accrete gas that enters already cold ( @xmath82 k ) in the dark matter halo following a filamentary , anisotropic flow , while large galaxies tend to be built mostly by accretion of gas that is shock heated to high temperatures ( @xmath190 k ) when it enters the halo and later cools down in a smooth , isotropic flow@xmath191 .",
    "the implications of these two modes of accretion on disk formation , for example their impact on angular momentum transport , are still unclear .",
    "the treshold halo mass that decides between cold and hot mode accretion is estimated to be around @xmath23 solar masses , namely comparable to the mass of the milky way or andromeda halo .",
    "this is interesting in the context of bulgeless galaxies .",
    "as we already noted , bulge - dominated galaxies such as the andromeda galaxy , are usually much more massive than bulgeless galaxies such as the m33 galaxy ( there are some examples of massive bulgeless galaxies , e.g. m101 in figure 1 ) , hence their different structure might be , at least partially , a product of these two different gas accretion modes .",
    "another aspect that needs attention is that for galaxies mainly accreting in the hot mode a thermal instability might develop in the cooling flow@xmath192 . as a result of",
    "that gas cools faster in slightly more overdense regions , giving rise to dense clouds nearly in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding gas@xmath193 ( see figure 12 ) . in this case",
    "the hot mode would not be a smooth cooling flow but would develop into a two - phase medium .",
    "clouds lose orbital angular momentum due to the hydrodynamical drag exerted by the surrounding gas and eventually reach the center at timescales different from gas that started out at the same radius but remained in the diffuse phase . since there is transfer of angular momentum between the cold and hot phase we expect some effects on disk formation .",
    "it is hard to predict , even qualitatively , in which direction the effect will be since both the hot and the cold phase will eventually contribute to the disk assembly .",
    "a very high resolution is required to resolve the thermal instability@xmath194 and cosmological simulations are just now becoming capable to do so .",
    "furthermore , another issue concerns a dynamical mechanism called adiabatic contraction . indeed",
    "the dark matter halo should slowly contract in response to the baryonic mass collapsing within it@xmath195 .",
    "this is a standard assumption of the one dimensional numerical models that we discussed earlier in this review ( see section 1 ) .",
    "different researchers who have developed numerical models of gas collapse within isolated spherical halos disagree slightly on the magnitude of the effect , i.e. on how strongly the overall potential well of the galaxy is modified@xmath196 . in any case , the effect of adiabatic contraction is to increase the maximum rotational velocity of the galaxy and to reduce the size of the disk because the overall potential well becomes deeper ( hence the radius at which a gas parcel can be in centrifugal equilibrium diminishes@xmath35 ) .",
    "this has an impact on any observed correlation between galaxy properties that involves the disk rotational velocity , for example the tully - fisher relation ( see previous section ) .",
    "recent work with one - dimensional numerical models has pointed out that , if adiabatic contraction is effective , it is impossible to match the observed tully - fisher relation even in the case that the angular momentum of the gas is perfectly conserved during the collapse  the resulting galaxies always rotate too fast@xmath197 .",
    "the fact that recent cosmological simulations are able to roughly match the tully fisher relation@xmath74 is thus not expected . however , this discrepancy might suggest that one - dimensional models can not capture the dynamics and thermodynamics of the three - dimensional collapse in a cosmological context . in particular , it is possible that the concept of adiabatic contraction is not appropriate for a structure formation model like @xmath17cdm in which a large fraction of the baryonic mass is added not via slow , smooth accretion of gas but rather via mergers and/or cold flows on timescales short enough to violate the assumption of adiabaticity in the first place .    finally , even if realistic disks could form it is not clear that they will survive intact until the present epoch in a universe where structure grows hierarchically . in a hierarchical universe a galaxy is always surrounded by smaller galaxies that will eventually perturb it during close fly - bies by raising tides , or even merge with it .",
    "cosmological simulations predict that these satellite galaxies have very eccentric , plunging orbits@xmath198 which should take them close to the disk of the primary galaxy .",
    "the tidal perturbations will deposit kinetic energy in the stellar disk , raising the random velocities of its stars and increasing its scale height@xmath199 .",
    "this is confirmed by recent three - dimensional simulations , although the extent of the damage , especially whether or not most of the disk survives intact despite the intruders , is still debated@xmath200 .",
    "tidal interactions will also trigger bar formation and eventually produce a bulge via the buckling instability ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "the disk might eventually re - growth as new gas is accreted from the halo or a gas - rich companion is digested , but this is still unclear at the moment .",
    "the study of disk heating by satellites is a difficult problem that requires a resolution beyond that currently possible in cosmological simulations .    in summary",
    ", there are several aspects of galaxy formation that still need to be understood in depth , and their overall impact on disk formation thus still awaits a clear assessment .",
    "this deeper understanding demands a substantial improvement in the resolution of the simulations and in the sub - grid recipes that describe the ism , star formation and feedback . yet , in our opinion , simply more computing power and better sub - grid methods are not going to solve many of the pressing issues in this field , such as the origin of bulgeless galaxies . instead , there is still room , and need , for new ideas and new approaches to the open questions .",
    "provided that this happens , computer simulations will then continue to play a central role in advancing our understanding of how disk galaxies form .",
