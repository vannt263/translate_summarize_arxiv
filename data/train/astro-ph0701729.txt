    "pulsating variable stars play a fundamental role in the study of stellar populations and in cosmology .",
    "in particular , classical cepheids ( cc ) and rrl stars are primary distance indicators and have a fundamental importance in the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale through their period - luminosity relation .        the pulsational properties of rrl stars are also used to estimate the local reddening ( @xcite ) , and the metallicity retrieved from the empirical relation between period and amplitude ( @xcite ) was found to be in good agreement with the mean abundance from the rgb ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , theoretical investigations indicate that the pulsation characteristics of rrl stars ",
    "topology of the instability strip , period and amplitude distribution  can be safely adopted to constrain the properties of the parent population ( age , metallicity , horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology ) as well as to put tight constraints on the mass , effective temperature , and distance modulus of the individual stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "rrl stars , acs and cc allow us tracing of the old ( t@xmath210  gyr ) , intermediate age ( a few gyr ) and young ( @xmath3100  myr ) stellar populations , respectively , therefore highlighting the eventual radial trends across the studied galaxy ( eg .",
    "phoenix : @xcite , leo i : @xcite ) .",
    "this , in turn , hints on the star formation history and the formation mechanisms of the host galaxy .     and rr@xmath1 in the f475w ( _ left _ ) and f814w ( _ right _ ) bands for tucana.,height=249 ]",
    "until recently , the study of faint variables like rrl stars was limited to the stellar systems associated to the milky way : its halo , globular clusters ( gcs ) and satellite dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) .",
    "the launch of the hst opened the possibility to obtain resolved - star photometry reaching the hb of crowded field to greater distances .",
    "the rrl stars of the andromeda galaxy and its vicinity have now been extensively surveyed ( eg . @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for the first time , as part of the cycle 14 hst / acs program ` the onset of star formation in the universe : constraints from nearby isolated dwarf galaxies ' , we obtained very deep ( @xmath4 ) multi - epoch images of four _ isolated _ dwarf galaxies of the local group : the dwarf spheroidals tucana and cetus , the dwarf irregular ( dirr ) ic1613 and the so - called transition dsph / dirr lgs3 .",
    "the daophot - ii / allstar and allframe packages ( @xcite ) were used to obtain the instrumental photometry of the stars on the individual images .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] presents the resulting color - magnitude diagrams for tucana and lgs3 .",
    "the candidate variables were extracted from the star list using the variability index given by daomaster .",
    "period search for the candidates was done using an implementation of the phase dispersion minimization method ( @xcite ) taking into account the information from both bands simultaneously .",
    "a sample of the light - curves for tucana variables is presented fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "as a preliminary work , we focused on the candidate variables found on one half of the acs chip 1 .",
    "this strip of @xmath5 , closest to chip 2 , samples a somewhat radial portion of the galaxies .",
    "it prevents the bias that a gradient in the properties of the variables could have on the average values .        in the studied field of tucana",
    ", we found 76 rr@xmath0 and 32 rr@xmath1 with mean periods of 0.59 and 0.35 days , respectively .",
    "the period is ill - defined for another 23 hb candidates .",
    "some of these candidates could be double - mode rrl ( rr@xmath6 ) . using only the rrl stars with well - defined periods , we find the ratio of rr@xmath1 to the total number of rrl stars to be 0.30 .",
    "the two variables located @xmath71.5 magnitude above the hb are most likely acs : they have well defined light - curves with large amplitude ( a@xmath8 ) and @xmath9 days .    for lgs3 , the small number of datapoints ( 12 in each band , vs. 32 for tucana ) made uncertain the period estimates , and",
    "the particular temporal sampling created strong aliasing .",
    "however , the period - amplitude diagram presented in fig .  [ fig:3 ] seems to support our choice of the period .",
    "it also shows that the amplitude of the rrl stars is systematically smaller in lgs3 than in tucana .",
    "although some of the lowest amplitudes are due to the lack of observations at maximum light , this trend has been noted for dsph and gc having a very red hb ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , the hb of lgs3 is mainly red , with rrl stars preferentially located near the red edge of the instability strip .    with the metallicities [ fe / h]=-1.5 and [ fe / h]=-1.8 obtained by fitting isochrones on the cmds of tucana and lgs3 , respectively , we found their mean rr@xmath0 period to be in excellent agreement with the mean period - metallicity relation of the gcs and dsph of the milky way .",
    "these values place both galaxies in the oosterhoff - intermediate group , as almost all the milky way dsph companions ( @xcite ) .",
