    "computational approaches to the realistic modeling of spatial epidemic spread make use of a wide array of simulation schemes  @xcite ranging from very detailed agent based approaches  @xcite to structured metapopulation models based on data - driven mobility schemes at the inter - population level  @xcite .",
    "all these approaches integrate a wealth of real world data .",
    "however , it is not yet clear how to discriminate the effects of the inclusion / lack of real world features in specific models .",
    "this limitation is mainly related to our incomplete knowledge of human interactions and mobility processes , which are fundamental aspects to describe a disease spread .",
    "while recent efforts started to make available massive data on human mobility from different sources and at different levels of description  @xcite , the multiscale nature of human mobility is yet to be comprehensively explored .",
    "human mobility can be generally described by defining a network of interacting communities where the connections and the corresponding intensity represent the flow of people among them  @xcite .",
    "global mobility networks are made of long range intercontinental air traffic  @xcite as well as massive short range commuting flows spanning several orders of magnitude in intensity and spatiotemporal scales  @xcite .",
    "transportation infrastructures and mobility patterns thus form very complex multiscale networks  @xcite which in general elude simple modeling approaches .",
    "a multitude of heuristic models for population structure and mobility patterns have been proposed but they all depend on the specific mobility process under consideration  @xcite .",
    "the limited understanding of the inter - relations among the multiple scales entailed in human mobility and their impact on the definition of epidemic patterns constitute a major road block in the development of predictive large - scale data driven epidemic models . in this context",
    "two questions stand out : i ) is there a most relevant mobility scale in the definition of the global epidemic pattern ?",
    "ii ) at which level of resolution of the epidemic behavior a given mobility scale starts to be relevant and to which extent ?    to begin addressing these questions , we use high resolution worldwide population data that allow for the definition of subpopulations according to a voronoi decomposition of the world surface centered on the locations of iata indexed airports .",
    "we have then gathered data on the commuting patterns of @xmath0 countries in @xmath2 continents , constructing short range commuting networks for the defined subpopulations .",
    "extensive analysis of these networks allows us to draw a general gravity law for commuting flows that reproduces commuting patterns worldwide .",
    "this law , valid at the scale defined by the tessellation process , is statistically stable across the world due to the globally homogeneous procedure applied to build the subpopulations around transportation hubs .",
    "the multiscale networks we obtain are integrated into the global epidemic and mobility modeler ( gleam ) , a computational platform that uses a metapopulation stochastic model on a global scale to simulate the large scale spreading of influenza like illnesses ( ilis ) .",
    "we develop a time - scale separation technique for evaluating the force of infection due to different mobility couplings that enables us to fully consider the effect of multiscale mobility processes in the disease dynamics .",
    "the model is then used to simulate a pandemic like event with tunable reproductive ratios .",
    "the results obtained from the full multiscale mobility network are compared to the simulations in which only the large scale coupling of the airline transportation network is included .",
    "our analysis shows that while commuting flows are , on average , one order of magnitude larger than the long range airline traffic , the global spatio - temporal patterns of disease spreading are mainly determined by the airline network .",
    "short range commuting interactions have on the other hand a role in defining a larger degree of synchronization of nearby subpopulations and specific regions which can be considered weakly connected by the airline transportation system . in particular , it is possible to show that short range mobility has an impact in the definition of the subpopulation infection hierarchy .",
    "the techniques developed here allow for an initial understanding of the level of data integration required to obtain reliable results in large scale modeling of infectious diseases .",
    "simulations of worldwide epidemic spread are generally based on structured metapopulation models that consider data - driven schemes for long range mobility at the inter - population level coupled with coarse - grained techniques within each subpopulation  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the global epidemic and mobility ( gleam ) computational scheme based on a georeferenced metapopulation approach in which the world is partitioned into geographical census regions coupled by population movements .",
    "this defines a subpopulation network where the connections between subpopulations represent the fluxes of individuals due to the transportation infrastructures and mobility patterns . inside each subpopulation ,",
    "the evolution of the infection is described by compartmental schemes in which the discrete stochastic dynamics of the individuals among the different compartments depends on the specific etiology of the disease considered ( see material and methods ) .",
    "the basic structure of gleam includes more than @xmath3 airports in @xmath4 different countries and the corresponding associated subpopulations .",
    "the full consideration of the multiscale nature of mobility networks requires a detailed spatial reference for each subpopulation in such a way as to map short range commuting fluxes among them with sufficient detail . for this reason we use a high resolution population database that allows for the definition of geographical census regions according to a voronoi decomposition of the world surface centered on the iata airports .",
    "such subpopulations are not limited by administrative subdivisions or built on postal zone boundaries . the high level of geographical resolution of the subpopulation database enable us to introduce effective short range mobility due to commuting patterns between neighboring census regions ( see material and methods ) .",
    "the main difficulty in introducing the effect of commuting flows worldwide is the lack of a global database as opposed to the case of the air traffic flow .",
    "data are scattered in different national and international databases that use different administrative and geographical granularities , and several definitions of commuting flows .",
    "we have collected commuting data from @xmath0 countries in @xmath2 different continents .",
    "each dataset was mapped into the gleam voronoi tessellation constructing the commuting networks at the subpopulation level .    in fig .",
    "[ multiscale ] , we show the commuting network of the continental us as obtained by mapping the county commuting data onto the subpopulations used by gleam . commuting data do not consider airline flows that are accounted for by the iata dataset . on the same scale",
    ", we also report the airline traffic network , readily highlighting the difference in scale and spatial structure of the two networks .",
    "the commuting network appears as an almost grid - like lattice connecting neighboring subpopulations , while the airline traffic network is dominated by long range connections .",
    "the wide range of scales is evident also in the intensities of the mobility flows , spanning several orders of magnitude , with the average commuting flow being one order of magnitude larger than the average airline traffic flow .",
    "finally , it should be noted that , in general , commuting flows refer to round trip processes with a characteristic time of the order of @xmath5 days ( average duration of a work day ) compared with much longer characteristic times for airline travel ( average value around @xmath6 weeks ) .    to gain more insight at the global level of the commuting flow we use the general gravity model from transportation theory  @xcite as a starting point .",
    "this assumes that the commuting flow @xmath7 between subpopulation @xmath8 ( with population @xmath9 ) and subpopulation @xmath10 ( with population @xmath11 ) takes on the form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a proportionality constant , @xmath14 and @xmath15 tune the dependence with respect to each subpopulation size and @xmath16 is a distance dependent functional form .",
    "gravity laws usually consider power or exponential laws for the behavior of @xmath16 .",
    "the results reported in the literature are variable and generally depend on the way the subpopulations are defined . in our case , we can take advantage of the statistical similarity of the subpopulations centered on major transportation hubs .",
    "we tested the gravity law by the statistical analysis of more than @xmath17 flows worldwide and we found that the best fit is obtained by using an exponential function @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the characteristic length that governs the decay of commuting flows . in table 1 , we report the estimated values for the exponents @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath19",

    "[ multiscale ] , where the commuting flows obtained from data are compared to the synthetic ones predicted by the model , as functions of the various variables of the gravity law .",
    "it is worth remarking that while the present gravity law works well at the granularity defined by our voronoi decomposition , these results can not be extrapolated at different granularities .",
    "for instance , we notice that the exponents obtained by our approach are quite close to those obtained by viboud et al .",
    "@xcite , although the spatial decay has a completely different form .",
    "it is difficult to ascertain the origin of the difference , but it must be noted that we are working with subpopulations which are by construction statistically more homogeneous and of larger size than the county level used in ref .",
    "administrative regions might indeed impose boundaries that define subpopulations not clearly associated to centers of gravity for mobility processes , as e.g. large urban areas cut in multiple counties .",
    "the above gravity law allows us to work with two different worldwide commuting networks .",
    "an entirely synthetic one , generated using the gravity law fitted to the empirical data , and one integrating the empirical data . in the following , we will report the results obtained only with the synthetic network as there are no significant differences are observed when we compare the results obtained by using the synthetic and the real data networks .      to study the effect that commuting networks have on the overall spread of an emerging disease we consider the simulation of an ili starting in hanoi and compare the results with a simulation in which we include only airline traffic as in previous works  @xcite .",
    "the model includes a seasonal dependence of the transmission and simulations are assumed to start on april 1 .",
    "gleam is fully stochastic and takes into account the discrete nature of individuals both in the travel coupling and in the compartmental transitions .",
    "the transmission model within each urban area follows a compartmentalization specific to the disease under study .",
    "here we use the classic ili compartmentalization in which each individual is classified by one of the discrete states such as susceptible ( @xmath20 ) , latent ( @xmath21 ) , infectious ( @xmath22 ) and permanently recovered ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "infectious persons are further subdivided into asymptomatic , symptomatic traveling and symptomatic non - traveling as detailed in the material and methods .",
    "the discrete nature of individuals is implemented by introducing binomial and multinomial processes inside each urban area for the stochastic evolution of the infection . in gleam , the airline mobility is integrated explicitly as individuals are allowed to travel from one subpopulation to another by means of the airline transportation network  @xcite similarly to the models in refs .",

    "the calculation can be extended to include transit traffic up to one connection flight  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of commuting flows represents a numerical challenge as it acts at a very different time scale with individuals which have very short visit duration in the neighboring subpopulation .",
    "while the airline traffic finds a natural time scale of one day , an equivalent mechanistic simulation of the commuting mobility would require to work on a much smaller time scale hardly compatible with the airline traffic .",
    "this problem can be solved by relying on the results of  @xcite .",
    "commuting flows govern subpopulation interactions by defining the visiting rate of individual in subpopulation @xmath8 to subpopulation @xmath10 as @xmath35 .",

    "we perform a sensitivity analysis by testing the outset variation of the intensity of the commuting flows and varying the return time rate @xmath36 of more than one order of magnitude . in the supporting information",
    "we show that the profiles do not show significant variations , the results being very robust against strong fluctuations in the commuting mobility process .",
    "the effect of commuting flows is , however , noticeable during the tail of the epidemic event . as presented in fig .",
    "[ global_impact ] , many regions of the world show a broader tail in the absence of commuting , showing that the commuting coupling enhances the synchronization of the local epidemic profiles .",
    "the observed broadening of an epidemic profile that includes multiple subpopulations is due to the different timing of the outbreak that reaches the various subpopulations .",

    "the epidemic radiates out to the neighboring geographical census areas in a pattern reminiscent of the physical process of diffusion .",
    "this effect naturally leads to a much stronger correlation and synchrony in the evolution of the pandemic at the local level .",
    "commuting flows therefore alter the hierarchy of epidemic transmission from region to region .",
    "this hierarchical organization can be inferred by constructing the epidemic invasion tree that represent the transmission of the infection from one subpopulation to the other during the history of the epidemic .",
    "the stochastic nature of the epidemic process implies that each realization will produce a different tree .",
    "an overall epidemic invasion network can be constructed by defining weighted directed links , @xmath50 , that denote the probability that the epidemic in subpopulation @xmath10 is seeded by individuals belonging to the subpopulation @xmath8 .",
