    "recently it was shown that if to the mssm we add bilinear r  parity violation ( brpv ) @xcite , the unification of the bottom and tau yukawa couplings at the scale @xmath18 gev ( where the gauge couplings unify ) is dramatically different from the mssm @xcite . in the brpv case ,",

    "the study of brpv is motivated by the fact that it provides a simple and useful parametrization of many of the features of a class of models in which r - parity is spontaneously broken @xcite .",
    "one of the main features of r  parity violating models is the appearance of masses for the neutrinos @xcite , attracting a lot of attention  @xcite since the latest results from super ",

    "tau yukawa unification in ref .",
    "in this section we provide a way to understand of the results presented above in the figures 1 to 6 . in to do this we make some approximations so that the relevant rge s have simple analytical solutions .",

    "tau yukawa unification is achieved at any value of @xmath1 , as opposed to the mssm , where only two disconnected regions of @xmath1 are allowed @xcite .",
    "we notice first that the quark and lepton masses are related to the different vevs and yukawa couplings in the following way @xmath94 where @xmath95 depends on the parameters of the chargino / tau mass matrix and is positive @xcite .",
    "this implies that the ratio of the bottom and tau yukawa couplings at the weak scale is given by @xmath96 and grows as @xmath97 is increased .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath98 and @xmath89 unify at the gut scale , then at the weak scale its ratio can be approximated by @xmath99 \\label{hb_htau}\\ ] ] implying that the combination @xmath100 should decrease when @xmath97 increases .    in the mssm region of high",
    "@xmath1 the bottom quark yukawa coupling dominates over the top one , and the opposite happens in the region of low @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , at high ( low ) values of @xmath1 , the yukawa coupling @xmath98 ( @xmath101 ) will decrease if @xmath97 increases , which implies an increase of @xmath50 ( @xmath102 ) in order to keep constant the quark masses .",
    "similarly , in order to keep constant the @xmath47 mass , @xmath103 , the vev @xmath102 ( @xmath50 ) decreases at the same time .",
    "this implies that unification occurs at lower ( higher ) values of @xmath1 as @xmath97 increases .",
    "this explains why in brpv intermediate values of @xmath1 are compatible with bottom ",
    "tau unification .",
    "let us now understand why the high @xmath1 branch is not allowed when we impose the @xmath104 constraint at the unification scale .",
    "the rge for the ckm angle @xmath104 is @xcite @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "in addition , the rge for the ratio between the charm and top quark yukawa couplings @xmath107 is @xmath108 imposing now the relation in eq .",

    "( [ rctvcbweak ] ) is greater than one ( approximately equal to 1.5 ) , it is clear that the gut condition @xmath110 prefers the region of parameter space where the top yukawa coupling is large while the bottom yukawa coupling is small .",
    "this is obtained at small values of @xmath1 , since our definition of @xmath75 retains the mssm relation @xmath111 . which has the advantage of being invariant under rotations defined at the beginning of section 3 , but spoils the relation between @xmath101 and @xmath98 described in the text .",
    "] this explains what it is seen in figs .",
    "[ tl99mr ] and [ tl99br ] .",
    "if the gut conditions are relaxed to more than 5% , eq .  ( [ rctvcbweak ] ) should be modified by adding a numerical factor different from one in front of the exponential .",
    "the effect is to allow larger values of @xmath98 that can only be achieved in brpv by increasing @xmath19 without having to go to very large values of @xmath1 as in the mssm .",
    "consequently , the plane @xmath112 is filled up in brpv and not in the mssm .",
    "now we would like to understand why in brpv larger values of @xmath1 are acceptable compared with the mssm when imposing the gut conditions at 5% .",
    "this effect is observed in figs .",
    "[ tl90 ] to [ ts99 ] .",
    "we notice first that our numerical results with 5% of unification indicate that brpv accepts values of @xmath101 slightly smaller than the mssm ( the upper bound on @xmath101 is the same in both models ) . considering the base independent parameter @xmath113 defined for example in refs .",
    "@xcite and whose expression in our basis is @xmath114 , we have for the top quark yukawa coupling @xmath115 this equation indicates that for a constant value of the top quark yukawa coupling , larger values of @xmath1 can be achieved in brpv compared with the mssm ( in the mssm @xmath116 ) when values of @xmath113 smaller than one are considered ( typically @xmath117 ) .",
    "the widening of the allowed region @xmath112 in brpv is also observed , although less pronounced , if we use the alternative definition of @xmath118 where we have @xmath119 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath120 unification in brpv can be achieved at larger values of @xmath121 , thus lowering @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "now a word about the neutrino mass .",
    "the question is whether the values of @xmath113 we find are compatible with small neutrino masses .",
    "the tau - neutrino neutrino mass is generated in brpv via mixing with neutralinos and a weak - scale - type see  saw type mechanism and can be expressed as @xmath122 where @xmath123 is another basis independent invariant which in our basis is equal to @xmath124 this parameter , which is proportional to the tau ",
    "sneutrino vev in the basis where the @xmath40 term is absent from the superpotential , has to be small in order to have a small neutrino mass . in models with universality of soft mass parameters at the gut scale , this parameter is naturally small and calculable , since it is generated by radiative corrections through the rge s of the soft parameters . it can be shown that @xmath125 where @xmath44 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 with @xmath30 and @xmath128 the bilinear soft mass parameters associated to @xmath39 and @xmath40 , all at the weak scale .",
    "the fraction at the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ zetaapp ] ) , which we denote as @xmath95 , is a good measure of the cancellation needed in order to have a small neutrino mass .",
    "it is approximately given by @xmath129 considering @xmath130 gev , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , the amount of cancellation necessary to obtain a neutrino mass @xmath133 ev is given by @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "we do not think that this is a fine tuning .",
    "for example note that the same amount of cancellation between vev s in the mssm is necessary in @xmath136 models where @xmath1 needs to be higher than 50 .",
    "in summary , in the context of supersymmetric models with universality of gauge and yukawa couplings we have studied the predictions for @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , implied by the georgi  jarlskog  nanopoulos anstze for fermion mass matrices .",

    "if we relax the level of validity of the latter condition , the large @xmath1 solution starts to reappear and it is fully valid when the conditions at the gut scale are imposed to within @xmath7 . but no intermediate @xmath1 solutions emerge .",

    "these effects are compatible even with tau neutrino masses as small as 0.1 ev .",
