    "in 1938 , kaptiza @xcite and allen / misener @xcite independently discovered that , below 2.17  k , liquid helium-4 can flow without friction .",
    "this superfluidity is also a property of dilute ultracold atomic gases , and has been demonstrated through the presence of a critical velocity @xcite , the formation of arrays of vortices under rotation @xcite and the observation of persistent flow @xcite .",
    "the high degree of control over both the gas interactions and the trapping potential allows detailed studies of superfluidity in these systems , whilst their accurate modelling is also possible using the mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "there have been numerous alternative proposals for toroidal atom traps using magnetic fields with @xcite or without rf - dressing @xcite , electrostatic fields @xcite , time - averaged optical fields @xcite or laguerre - gauss beams @xcite .",
    "an advantage of using optical rather than magnetic potentials is that they are suitable for trapping atoms in any state . in order for any of these to be used to study superflow of ultracold atoms , a stirring mechanism needs to be introduced , such as the transfer of orbital angular momentum from an additional light source @xcite or a stirring laser beam @xcite .",
    "we propose a new method of generating optical ring traps with which to study superfluidity phenomena .",
    "the trapping potential is created by a computer generated hologram ( cgh ) and a phase - only spatial light modulator ( slm ) , and incorporates a controllable stirring mechanism using the same laser beam .",
    "our slm is a programmable diffractive optical device which consists of a two - dimensional array of pixels .",
    "each of these is individually controllable , imprinting an arbitrary phase onto incident light .",
    "if the diffracted light is then focussed by a lens , the intensity distribution in the focal plane of the lens is given by the fourier transform of the phase pattern on the slm , allowing freedom to create arbitrary intensity distributions . by displaying a sequence of phase patterns on the slm",
    ", dynamic light patterns can also be generated .",
    "cghs are becoming increasingly popular as a method to trap ultracold atoms .",
    "slms have been proposed as a tool for generating a number of exotic trapping geometries beyond those achievable with standing - wave technologies , such as atom interferometers @xcite and ring lattices @xcite , while they have been used to manipulate single atoms @xcite , clouds of cold atoms from a magneto - optical trap @xcite and a bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "all works to date have used either arrays of dipole potentials or patterns for which the phase is well known , e.g. laguerre - gauss beams .    in general , calculating a phase pattern which will produce an arbitrary desired intensity distribution is not an easy task as the undefined phase in the fourier plane gives the problem many solutions .",
    "however , the calculation can be performed using relatively slow direct search algorithms @xcite , computationally - demanding but highly - accurate genetic algorithms@xcite or computationally - efficient iterative fourier transform algorithms such as gerchberg - saxton @xcite or adaptive - additive @xcite . in 2008 , pasienski and demarco introduced a variant of these algorithms : the mixed - region amplitude freedom ( mraf ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "this allows the creation of smooth , continuous two - dimensional optical traps .",
    "however , until now experimental achievement of optical traps suitable for ultracold atoms using this algorithm has not been shown .    by recording intensity patterns on a ccd camera , we show that the mraf algorithm can generate light patterns suitable for trapping a bose ",
    "einstein condensate .",
    "we further demonstrate that this trap can be dynamically varied in order to induce superflow .",
    "we also find that the physical implementation of these cghs using slms is susceptible to aberrations in the optical system and imperfect device response , thus introducing errors and roughness that were not present during the calculation .",
    "however , we show that this roughness can be reduced by incorporating the mraf algorithm into a feedback loop .",
    "finally , we discuss the future integration of our trap into a cold atoms experiment .",
    "a conservative trapping potential for ultracold atoms can be generated with focussed laser light far - detuned from an atomic transition .",
    "light of intensity @xmath0 which is detuned by @xmath1 from an atomic transition frequency @xmath2 gives a trapping potential    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the natural linewidth of the atomic transition and @xmath5 is the speed of light .",
    "we design an annular light pattern of intensity @xmath6 with two bright spots of intensity @xmath7 , given by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the radius of the ring , @xmath10 is the angular position of the bright spots , and @xmath11 is the @xmath12 waist of the gaussian ring potential , as shown in figure [ fig : targpred ] .",
    "the mraf algorithm divides the output plane into three regions : the measure region , the signal region and the noise region .",
    "the measure region closely matches the boundaries of the light pattern , whilst the signal region is large enough to contain the measure region plus a border which will be devoid of light .",
    "the amplitude of the light in these regions is fixed to match the target amplitude , meaning `` noise '' on the pattern can only exist in the noise region ( the entire plane outside the signal region ) , where the amplitude is unconstrained .",
    "the algorithm converges to a solution within 100 iterations and the rms error of the calculated output is @xmath13 .     in the measure region",
    "this has been achieved by allowing unwanted light to be present outside the signal region.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we plan to induce superflow by `` stirring '' the atoms in the ring potential by rotating the bright spots within the pattern .",
    "this is possible by replacing the phase pattern on the slm with one which corresponds to the next position of the bright spots , as shown in figure [ fig : rotred]a .",
    "the experiments reported in @xcite showed superflow of atoms with angular momentum @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which for their trap corresponds to a rotational frequency of around @xmath16hz and @xmath17hz respectively",
    ". the maximum rate at which our slm can refresh the whole pattern is @xmath18hz , which allows a maximum of @xmath19 steps within one complete rotation of our ring trap .",
    "the difference between consecutive positions of the bright spots should thus be sufficiently small that the motion of the stirring appears continuous to the atoms .",
    "once superflow has begun , the stirring beams can be gradually removed , as shown in figure [ fig : rotred]b . as in @xcite",
    ", we plan to ramp the value @xmath20 to zero within @xmath21ms , which allows us to refresh the pattern ten times .",
    "our slm ( boulder nonlinear systems p256 ) has @xmath22 nematic liquid crystal pixels , each of which can shift the phase of an incoming laser beam in steps of @xmath23 .",
    "we send the phase pattern calculated using mraf to our slm , which is illuminated with collimated and spatially filtered light from a @xmath24 nm diode laser . to illuminate the slm as uniformly as possible ,",
    "we expand the beam to a @xmath12 radius of @xmath25 mm to overfill the active area of the slm , a square of side length @xmath26 mm .",
    "this ensures that all pixels of the slm are illuminated by a comparable light power .",
    "mraf is capable of calculating the phase required to generate the desired intensity distribution regardless of the incoming beam profile , so in future the overfilling could be relaxed to allow more power in the optical trap .",
    "the fact that mraf shifts light into the noise region coupled to losses due to our overfilling and to the generation of other diffracted orders gives us @xmath27 of the incoming light in the actual optical trap . however , this low efficiency does not limit the application of the optical traps .    whilst we have used a limited power for diagnostics ,",
    "our slm can be illuminated by up to @xmath28w@xmath29 .",
    "we could , for example , illuminate the slm with @xmath30mw of @xmath24 nm light to generate a ring of radius @xmath31 m and waist @xmath32 m , giving us @xmath33mw in the measure region ; this corresponds to a ring trap of depth @xmath34nk for @xmath35rb atoms .",
    "the light pattern shown here is two - dimensional , and disperses quickly away from the fourier plane . to confine atoms to the fourier plane we will add an orthogonal light sheet with a trapping frequency close to that of the ring trap .",
    "the chemical potential of a bose ",
    "einstein condensate in a ring trap is calculated using the thomas - fermi approximation to be    @xmath36    where @xmath9 is the radius of the ring as before , @xmath37hz is the radial trapping frequency , @xmath38 is the number of trapped atoms and @xmath39 is the s - wave scattering length . for @xmath40 @xmath35rb atoms in the ring trap described above",
    ", the chemical potential is @xmath41nk .",
    "this is around one third of the trap depth given above , thus making trapping possible .",
    "whilst the computed patterns give smooth and accurate trapping potentials , imperfect device response and aberrations cause significant discrepancies and roughness in the resulting light pattern shown in figure [ fig : outputs]a .",
    "we improve the light pattern s suitability as an atom trap by including the algorithm in a feedback loop .",
    "placing a ccd camera ( thorlabs dcu200 series ) in the fourier plane of a @xmath42 mm lens allows us to measure the difference between the target profile and the real recorded intensity pattern .",
    "we then create a new target pattern by subtracting the discrepancy from the original target , and re - run the mraf algorithm in an attempt to minimise this difference .",
    "after a few iterations , the measured light profile shown in figure [ fig : outputs]b is noticeably closer to the original target . to illustrate this",
    ", we plot the intensity of light around the trapping minimum of a section of the ring by integrating over the pixels within a small angle , as shown in figure [ fig : outputs]c .",
    "it follows from equation [ eqn : trappingpot ] that any roughness in the intensity of the light pattern produces a roughness in the energy landscape , which may in turn cause heating or fragmentation of the atom cloud .",
    "our feedback loop reduce the rms error from @xmath43 to @xmath44 at the minimum of our optical trap .",
    "this gives us a roughness of @xmath45 , lower than the value reported in @xcite , which should allow us to observe superflow in this trap .",
    "as experiments with cold atoms are carried out under vacuum , the windows of the vacuum system will themselves introduce aberrations which would not be accounted for by the feedback loop in its present form .",
    "however , atoms are a very sensitive probe of roughness of the trapping potential , so we envisage continuing to use the feedback loop by taking absorption images of the trapped atoms rather than directly imaging the light profile , and use these images within the feedback loop .",
    "we have shown that computer generated holographic techniques supplemented with a feedback algorithm can produce flexible , smooth , all - optical traps for the investigation of superfluidity and persistent currents in ultracold atoms .",
    "the trap depth at different points of the pattern can be dynamically varied and the whole pattern can be rotated to induce superflow .",
    "the geometry created using this method need not be restricted to the one presented here : the creation of ring lattices or ring potentials with areas of lowered intensity for the investigation of josephson tunnelling , or increasingly non - trivial geometries , should be possible .",
    "for example , by creating two of these traps which intersect and rotate in opposite directions , one could investigate an area of crossing superfluids .",
    "an appropriate choice of trapping light wavelength will allow mixtures of ultracold bosons and fermions and their corresponding superfluidities to be investigated . improved understanding of superfluidity in ultracold atoms may help to solve more difficult problems in condensed matter physics , such as the much - sought explanation of high-@xmath46 superconductors .",
