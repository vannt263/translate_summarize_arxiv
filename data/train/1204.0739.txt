    "chondrules are submillimeter to millimeter - sized , mostly fe - mg silicate spherules found within chondritic meteorites .",
    "chondrule precursors were heated to high temperatures and melted , and then slowly cooled and crystallized to form chondrules , while they were independent , free - floating objects in the early solar nebula . a wealth of elemental and isotopic compositional measurements , as well as mineralogical and petrological information , potentially place important constraints on the melting and cooling of chondrules .",
    "the physical conditions and processes acting in the early solar nebula could be deciphered , if the chondrule formation mechanism could be understood .",
    "various chondrule formation models have been proposed .",
    "these are assessed against their ability to match the following meteoritic constraints : ( 1 ) models must explain why most chondrules appear to have formed only millions of years after the oldest solids formed in the solar nebula ( calcium - rich , aluminum - rich inclusions , otherwise known as cais ) .",
    "radiometric ( al - mg and pb - pb ) dating shows that nearly all extant chondrules formed @xmath4 after cais , with the majority forming 2 - 3 myr after cais ( kurahashi et al . 2008 ; villeneuve et al . 2009 ) .",
    "( 2 ) models must explain the high number density of chondrules in the formation region .",
    "about 5% of chondrules are compound chondrules , chondrules that fused together while still partially molten ( gooding & keil 1981 ; ciesla et al .",
    "2004a ) . based on this frequency and an assumed relative velocity @xmath5 , a number density of chondrules",
    "@xmath6 has been inferred ( gooding & keil 1981 ; ciesla et al .",
    "cuzzi & alexander ( 2006 ) also require a density @xmath7 so that the partial pressure of volatiles following chondrule melting remains high enough to suppress substantial loss of further volatiles .",
    "this density is significantly higher than the average density of chondrules in the solar nebula .",
    "based on a silicate - to - gas mass fraction @xmath8 ( lodders 2003 ) and the observation that chondrules comprise 75% of the mass of an ordinary chondrite ( e.g. , grossman 1988 ) , we expect the chondrules - to - gas ratio to be @xmath9 ( although this value may be lower if a large percentage of the available solids are locked up in planetary embryos ) . assuming a chondrule mass @xmath10 , consistent with a chondrule of radius @xmath11 and internal density @xmath12 , and a nebula gas density @xmath13 ( desch 2007 )",
    ", we would expect a chondrule number density @xmath14 , where the chondrules - to - gas mass ratio is defined to be @xmath15 , with @xmath16 representing an additional concentration factor . here , the chondrule precursor radius of @xmath17 m is chosen to be consistent with chondrules found in most chondrites .",
    "it is reasonable , however , to assume that there was a size distribution between matrix - sized grains and large chondrule precursors in the solar nebula prior to a chondrule - forming event .",
    "morris & desch ( 2012 ) find that cooling rates are increased slightly for simple size distributions , but not enough to affect the general results of the shock model .",
    "we therefore consider only a single size for simplicity . in the chondrule - forming region , chondrules appear to have been concentrated by large factors , up to 100 times their background density ( for a relative velocity of @xmath5 ) .",
    "( 3 ) models must allow for simultaneous chondrule formation over large regions ( @xmath18 in size ) to limit diffusion of volatiles away from chondrules , in order to keep the partial pressures of the volatiles high enough to suppress isotopic fractionation of these volatiles ( cuzzi & alexander 2006 ) .",
    "likewise , the existence of compound chondrules argues for regions larger than the mean free path of a chondrule through a cloud of chondrules , which is 100 - 1000 km for the densities quoted above .",
    "( 4 ) models must explain the relatively slow cooling of chondrules over hours .",
    "comparison of chondrule petrologic textures with experimental analogs show that the 80% of chondrules in ordinary chondrites that have porphyritic textures ( gooding & keil 1981 ) cooled from their peak temperatures at rates @xmath19 and crystallized in a matter of hours ( desch & connolly 2002 ; hewins et al .  2005 ; connolly et al .",
    "2006 ; lauretta et al . 2006 ) .",
    "( 5 ) the partial pressure of na may have been considerably higher than is easily explained by volatile loss from chondrules .",
    "alexander et al .",
    "( 2008 ) recently reported high mass fractions @xmath20 of na@xmath21o in the cores of olivine phenocrysts of semarkona chondrules , indicating that the olivine melt contained substantial na .",
    "the implied partial pressures of na vapor in the chondrule - forming region are @xmath22 .",
    "if this vapor is supplied by the chondrules themselves , chondrule concentrations @xmath23 would be required .",
    "such a high chondrule concentration would have significant and even incredible physical consequences , but it has been difficult to explain the high na concentrations in the chondrule olivine by any other method ( alexander et al .",
    "many additional constraints on chondrule formation exist as well ( see desch et al .",
    "2012 , accepted ) .",
    "the model that appears most consistent with the constraints on chondrule formation is the nebular shock model , in which chondrules are melted by passage through shock waves in the solar nebula gas ( desch et al .",
    "2005 , 2010 , 2012 ) . of the sources of shocks considered to date ,",
    "two were found to be most plausible by desch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) : large - scale shocks driven by gravitational instabilities ( e.g. , boss & durisen 2005 ; boley & durisen 2008 ) , and bow shocks driven by planetesimals on eccentric orbits ( e.g. , hood 1998 ; ciesla et al .",
    "2004b ; hood et al .  2009",
    "; hood & weidenschilling 2011 ) .",
    "a planetesimal or other body on an eccentric orbit will inevitably drive a bow shock in front of it , because its orbital velocity necessarily differs from that of the gas , which remains on circular orbits with nearly the keplerian velocity @xmath24 .",
    "a body with eccentricity @xmath25 will have a purely azimuthal velocity at aphelion or perihelion , but one that differs from the local keplerian velocity by an amount @xmath26 . at other locations in its orbit",
    "the protoplanet also has a radial velocity .",
    "if the body s orbit is inclined , this also enhances the relative velocity .",
    "the combined effect is that the body s velocity relative to the gas can remain a substantial fraction of the keplerian velocity ( @xmath27 at 2 au ) over its entire orbit .",
    "as one plausible example , which we discuss further in section 6.1 , we show in figure 1 the velocity difference @xmath28 between the gas and solid body on an eccentric orbit with semi - major axis @xmath29 , eccentricity @xmath30 and inclination @xmath31 . the relative velocity is seen to vary over the orbit but it remains @xmath32 at all times . as the typical sound speed in the gas is @xmath33 , a bow shock is the inevitable result of an eccentric planetary body . the authors above ( hood 1998 ; ciesla et al .  2004b ; hood et al .",
    "2009 ; hood & weidenschilling 2011 ) have argued that planetesimals , bodies up to several @xmath34 in radius , on eccentric orbits , would be common enough to drive sufficient shocks to melt the observed mass of chondrules , which is @xmath35 ( grossman 1988 ) .    despite their presumed ubiquity",
    ", planetesimal bow shocks have not been favored as the chondrule - forming mechanism . because chondrules are associated with asteroids and formation in the asteroid belt , only planetesimals @xmath36 in diameter have been considered so far . for such bodies ,",
    "the size of the heated region , which is necessarily comparable to the size of the planetesimal itself , is probably too small to satisfy the above constraints on the chondrule - forming region .",
    "more importantly , the small size of the heated region means chondrules are never far from cold , unshocked gas to which they can radiate and cool .",
    "the optically thin geometry is expected to lead to very fast cooling rates , and matching the cooling rates necessary to reproduce the dominant porphyritic texture in particular , @xmath37 , requires physical conditions that appear extreme ( e.g. , ciesla et al .",
    "2004b ; morris et al .",
    "2010a , b ) .",
    "intuitively , suppression of the radiation that cools the chondrules requires requires the optical depth @xmath38 between the chondrule - forming region and the unshocked gas to be @xmath39 . in their treatment of the problem ,",
    "morris et al .",
    "( 2010a , b ) found that optical depths @xmath40 led to cooling rates @xmath41 , just barely consistent with the constraints .",
    "our treatment of chondrule cooling here ( see  4 ) suggests slightly slower cooling , but the cooling rates @xmath42 consistent with porphyritic textures require optical depths @xmath43 . the optical depth is a function of the opacity and the size of the region .",
    "dust grains that might otherwise increase the opacity are found to vaporize in shocks strong enough to melt chondrules ( morris & desch 2010 ) . the opacity of chondrules themselves , at their background levels , does not yield @xmath44 unless the size of the region is @xmath45 . even if chondrules are concentrated by the considerable factor of 100 times their background level , so that @xmath46 , planetesimals at least several hundred kilometers in radius are required to yield marginally consistent cooling rates ( ciesla et al .",
    "2004b ; morris et al .",
    "2010a , b ) . to the extent that mass is locked up in large planetary bodies rather than dust and chondrule - sized objects , even higher concentrations of chondrules above background levels",
    "are required .",
    "another difficulty of the planetesimal bow shock model , one that has not been discussed previously , is that due to the small size of the planetesimal , chondrule precursors passing close enough to the body to be melted as chondrules are likely to be accreted by the planetesimal . unlike the gas",
    ", whose velocity is immediately altered at the shock front to flow around the body , chondrules have sufficient inertia that they retain their pre - shock velocity until they have collided with their own mass of gas .",
    "chondrules can be deflected around the body driving the bow shock only by moving a minimum length through the gas past the shock front . for typical parameters",
    "this length is @xmath47 .",
    "the stand - off distance between the bow shock and a 500 km - radius planetesimal driving it is typically @xmath48 ( see  2 ) , meaning that accretion onto the planetesimal is probable .",
    "this is problematic because chondrules are expected to mix with cold nebular components before accretion , and a given chondrite will contain chondrules with a wide variety of ages .",
    "chondrules melted in bow shocks around bodies _ larger _ than planetesimals may conform better to the constraints on chondrule cooling rates and the size of the chondrule forming region .",
    "the terrestrial planets have long been recognized to have formed from planetary embryos , bodies @xmath49 in diameter or even much larger , and it has been recognized that these embryos could have formed in a few myr or less ( wetherill & stewart 1993 ; weidenschilling 1997 ) . mars itself is considered a starved planetary embryo ( chambers & wetherill 1998 ) , which allows the timing of embryo formation to be fixed .",
    "previous hf - w isotopic analyses had suggested mars had differentiated within 10 myr of cai formation ( nimmo & kleine 2007 ) .",
    "more recently , the analysis of hf and w , in conjunction with th , by dauphas & pourmond ( 2011 ) suggests that mars accreted 50% of its mass ( and 80% of its radius ) within 2 myr of cais .",
    "formation of the terrestrial planets requires dozens of such embryos .",
    "the timing of mars s formation establishes that the solar nebula contained not just planetesimals , but _ protoplanets _",
    ", during the epoch of chondrule formation",
    ".    moreover , some of these planetary embryos quite plausibly found themselves on eccentric orbits at least some of the time .",
    "mutual scattering events are common in n - body simulations ( chambers 2001 ; raymond et .",
    "al 2006 ) .",
    "one recent model for the origin of mars in particular suggests that it suffered close encounters with other bodies in an annulus interior to 1 au , and was scattered into an inclined , eccentric orbit with aphelion at 1.5 au ( hansen 2009 ) .",
    "alternatively , walsh et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have simulated the early migration of jupiter and shown it leads to a truncated inner disk ( consistent with the hansen 2009 model ) and an excess of dynamically excited planetary embryos ( at least 5 in number ) at 1.0 au , from which they propose mars formed . the true extent to which embryos were scattered is not well known , but is a common feature of planet formation models .    the recent confirmation by dauphas & pourmand ( 2011 ) that large planetary embryos did exist at the time of chondrule formation , the expectation that such planetary embryos may be scattered onto eccentric orbits , and the larger size of the chondrule forming region around planetary embryos strongly motivate us to consider chondrule formation in bow shocks around planetary embryos several 1000 km in radius . despite the obvious similarities to chondrule formation in planetesimal bow shocks , chondrule formation in planetary embryo bow shocks",
    "differs in several significant ways .",
    "first , as the planetary radius and size of the chondrule forming region increase above a threshold of about 1000 km ( for the embryo radius ) , the region of heated chondrules becomes optically thick , fundamentally altering the chondrule cooling rates .",
    "second , chondrules flowing around bodies larger than about 1000 km in radius can dynamically recouple with the gas and avoid hitting the embryo s surface",
    ". chondrules in planetesimal bow shocks , if their impact parameters are less than the planetesimal radius , are likely to be accreted by the planetesimal .",
    "a third fundamental difference is that planetary embryos larger than about 1000 km in radius are able to accrete a primary atmosphere from the nebula and retain secondary outgassed atmospheres .",
    "the escape velocity from a body with radius @xmath50 and mars - like density ( @xmath51 = 3.94  g  @xmath52 ) is @xmath53 , compared to a typical sound speed @xmath54 ( at 150 k ) . the atmosphere retained by",
    "the larger planetary embryo will affect the trajectories of gas and chondrules flowing past it , and will also alter the chemistry of the chondrule formation environment .",
    "we are motivated to study chondrule formation in planetary embryo bow shocks because of these fundamental differences .",
    "here we present new calculations of the melting of chondrules in bow shocks around large protoplanets on eccentric orbits .",
    "we show that for reasonable parameters , chondrule formation in planetary embryo bow shocks is consistent with the major constraints listed above .",
    "we show that for the largest eccentricities and inclinations we consider plausible the shocks speeds of @xmath55 needed for chondrule formation ( morris et al .",
    "2010a , b ;  4 ) are sustained for much of the protoplanet s orbit . for the first time , we follow the trajectories of chondrules formed in bow shocks and demonstrate that they are not accreted by the protoplanet , whereas chondrules formed in bow shocks around planetesimals _ are _ accreted .",
    "based on the spatial distribution of chondrules , we calculate the optical depths and calculate chondrule cooling rates .",
    "we show that the large scale of planetary embryo bow shocks yields chondrule cooling rates consistent with meteoritic constraints .",
    "we show that chondrules formed in planetary embryo bow shocks do pass through what is essentially the planet s upper atmosphere , and therefore may be exposed to high vapor pressures of species outgassed from the protoplanet s magma ocean , including @xmath56 and na vapor .",
    "we compute the rate at which a protoplanet s eccentricity and inclination are damped , and show that the protoplanet s orbit remains eccentric and can drive shocks for @xmath57 .",
    "we find that a single scattered planetary embryo can process up to @xmath58 of chondrules .",
    "we have numerically investigated the hydrodynamics of a bow shock around a planetary embryo using the adaptive - mesh , eulerian hydrodynamics code , flash ( fryxell et al .",
    "we consider a stationary protoplanet on a cylindrical ( axisymmetric ) 2-d grid .",
    "we simulate the relative motion of the protoplanet through the gas by imposing a supersonic inflow of gas along the symmetry axis , originating at the @xmath59 boundary .",
    "our assumed boundary conditions allow for inflow on the @xmath59 boundary , reflection on the symmetry axis , and diode ( zero - gradient ) boundary conditions on the other boundaries .",
    "we consider two physical cases : that of a planetesimal and one of a planetary embryo .    in the first case of a planetesimal",
    ", we consider a body with mass @xmath60 , a radius of @xmath61 , yielding a density of @xmath62 ( similar to mars s density ) .",
    "the computational domain has radius 16,000 km and vertical extent 32,000 km .",

    "the effective scale height near the protoplanet surface is @xmath81 , and is easily resolved by our best grid resolution of 32 km . the primary atmosphere acquired by the planetary embryo in our simulations matched this solution within a few percent .",
    "the mass of the atmosphere inside 1000 km of the protoplanet surface is very nearly @xmath82 , also in accord with analytical estimates .",
    "we do not directly simulate the effects of a secondary atmosphere of species outgassed from the protoplanet s magma ocean , which would be orders of magnitude denser , but we expect it would behave very similarly dynamically .",
    "we begin our simulation of the bow shock with the protoplanet and primary atmosphere , and introduce gas streaming up from the lower @xmath83 boundary with density @xmath84 and upward velocity @xmath85 .",
    "we chose this density to represent conditions of the chondrule - forming region , presumed to be at 2 - 3 au ( but see  6 ) .",
    "however , disk models differ on gas densities in the protoplanetary disk . for example",
    ", the density @xmath84 is achieved in a minimum - mass solar nebula model ( hayashi 1981 ) at 1.25 au ( depending on the scale height ) , or at several ( up to 5 ) au in more massive disk models ( desch 2007 ) .",
    "we chose the relative velocity of @xmath86 based on the results of morris & desch ( 2010 ) , who showed that this speed was necessary to achieve chondrule melting .",
    "such a large relative velocity may appear to be extreme , but such values are expected to be met episodically throughout planet formation , even though the typical relative velocity is expected to be much lower . a velocity difference of @xmath86 between the body and",

    "this body will produce a @xmath89 km / s bow shock at quadrature ( @xmath90 au ) , which is a plausible site for the formation of some chondrules . compared with the total population of embryos ,",
    "such high relative velocities may be rare , but when they do occur , they can be very significant , as we will show .    in both the planetesimal and planetary embryo cases ,",
    "the evolution of the gas is marked by a reverse shock bouncing off the body surface and multiple shocks reflecting off each other at the symmetry axis . within a few crossing times ( i.e. , a few @xmath91 ) for the planetesimal case , and a few @xmath92 for the planetary embryo case ) ,",

    "we observed that the bow shock around the planetesimal quickly achieved steady state , but as is evident from figure  [ fig : streamlines]b , steady - state is not formally achieved around the protoplanet .",
    "this is observed by the varying density in the wake of the protoplanet , and the slightly irregular structure of the bow shock ( e.g. , the kink at @xmath97 ) .",

    "reflections of sound waves off of these rolls is responsible for the irregular structure at the bow shock .",
    "eventually these kh rolls will strip away the atmosphere surrounding the protoplanet .",
    "numerical simulations of the stripping of gravitationally bound gas by kh rolls at the surfaces of protoplanetary disks by ouellette et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggest that the efficiency of stripping is about 1% , meaning that the mass of gas that is stripped is about 1% of the mass of the impacting gas .",
    "based on the inflow of gas @xmath101 , we estimate a stripping rate @xmath102 .",
    "this suggests that loss of the primary atmosphere would take @xmath103 , hundreds of times longer than the duration of our simulation .",
    "we were able to quantify this stripping rate via a  dye \" calculation in which we kept track separately of material accreted before the supersonic flow of gas on the grid .",
    "we found that after an initial loss of gas , the primary atmosphere was being lost on timescales @xmath104 , suggesting a stripping rate @xmath105 .",
    "the existence of this interface between an atmosphere and the post - bow shock flow is a fundamental difference between the planetesimal and protoplanet cases .",
    "having established the dynamics of the gas and the structure of the bow shock surrounding the planetary embryo , we now turn our attention to the trajectories of chondrules and their precursors in the flow . in general , the particles are dynamically coupled to the gas , except in the vicinity of the bow shock , when the gas suddenly changes velocity over a few molecular mean free paths ( i.e. , over a few meters ) .",
    "particles will dynamically recouple with the gas on a timescale comparable to the aerodynamic stopping time , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the particle internal density , @xmath108 is its radius , @xmath109 the post - shock gas density , and @xmath110 the post - shock gas sound speed . for @xmath111 and @xmath112 ,",
    "the stopping time is 50 seconds .",
    "if the planetary body is traveling through the gas at a speed @xmath85 , particles will move past the shock front several hundred km before they dynamically couple to the gas .",
    "based on the numerical simulations above , this lengthscale is less than or comparable to the distance between the shock front and the planetary bodies themselves .",
    "the expectation is that particles passing through a bow shock will be accreted onto a planetesimal and will flow around a planetary embryo , although clearly a careful calculation of the trajectories is required to determine their fate .",
    "we are also motivated to calculate the trajectories of particles carefully to determine if they will melt and cool in a manner consistent with chondrules .",
    "the maximum heating of the chondrules is set by their velocity relative to the gas after passing through the shock front , which sets their degree of melting .",
    "their cooling after melting is set by the optical depth between the particles and the unshocked gas , which in turn is set by the geometry and spatial distribution of the particles .",
    "these must be calculated numerically .",
    "we have computed the trajectories of particles by integrating the particles motions through the gas , assuming the gas flow around the planetary body is in a steady state .",
    "we assume the particles are tracers only , with no dynamical effect on the gas .",
    "particles are accelerated by the gravity of the planetary embryo ( with mass @xmath113 ) and by the drag force due to gas of density @xmath109 : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the position vector of the chondrule ( with respect to the planet center ) , and @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the chondrule and gas velocities .",
    "particles are in the epstein limit ( much smaller than the mean free paths of gas molecules ) , and the drag force is given by @xmath118 where we will assume the particle temperature @xmath119 locally equals the gas temperature @xmath120 , and where @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the mean molecular weight of the gas and @xmath123 is boltzmann s constant ( probstein 1968 ) .",

    "particle velocities are integrated using a simple explicit scheme that is first - order in time , with timesteps of 0.05 s. particles move no more than 0.4 km during each timestep , which is significantly smaller than the spatial resolution of the hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "the trajectories of chondrules around both the planetesimal and the planetary embryo are depicted in figures  [ fig : streamlines]a and  [ fig : streamlines]b .",
    "these are seen to be significantly affected by the size of the region between the shock front and the body . at the shock front the gas undergoes a nearly instantaneous shift in velocity .",
    "chondrules regain dynamical equilibrium with the gas only after they move through the gas by a stopping length @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the stopping time ( equation 2 ) and @xmath126 is the velocity of a chondrule with respect to the gas .",
    "this quantity depends only on the gas density @xmath109 , not the radius of the planetary body .",
    "for both the planetesimal and planetary embryo cases , the stopping time @xmath127 ( assuming a gas density @xmath128 ) , over which time the chondrules slow from a velocity ( relative to the planet ) of @xmath86 to about @xmath129 .",
    "assuming an average velocity @xmath130 , chondrules will typically move about 250 km past the shock front .",
    "this stopping length is to be compared to the size of the post - shock region , specifically the standoff distance between the shock front and the planetary body itself . for the @xmath61 planetesimal case ,",
    "this standoff distance between the shock front and the planetesimal is @xmath131 .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that all chondrules with impact parameter @xmath132 are accreted onto the planetesimal .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath66 planetary embryo case , the standoff distance to the planet is @xmath133 , or @xmath134 to the atmosphere , much greater than the stopping length .",
    "thus , the vast majority of chondrules dynamically recouple with the gas before hitting the planet . only those chondrules with @xmath135 might be accreted , and chondrules that escape accretion flow around the body . along the way",
    ", their trajectories are affected by the kh instabilities between the shocked gas and the primary atmosphere .",
    "this makes it difficult to predict their _ exact _ trajectories , but it is clear that they will escape accretion onto the body .    moving forward",
    "it is important to distinguish between particles that pass through the shock front more directly and are melted as chondrules , and those particles that pass through the shock front far from the body and are not melted as chondrules . only particles that pass through the shock front with sufficient velocity @xmath126 relative to the gas will melt as chondrules . the heating rate of chondrules after they pass through the shock front scales as @xmath136 ( up to the liquidus temperature ) . as we discuss in  4 , a shock speed of @xmath137 is required to ensure melting of chondrules , which is equivalent to @xmath138 .",
    "the relative velocity between chondrules and gas is a function of the impact parameter @xmath139 , and is easily calculated for the case @xmath140 km ( chondrules and gas impact the body directly ) . just past the shock front",
    ", chondrules retain their velocity but gas is immediately slowed by a factor of @xmath141 .",
    "the velocity difference between gas and chondrules is thus @xmath142 ) @xmath143 . as the impact parameter @xmath139",
    "is increased , this relative velocity decreases .",
    "this is because only the component of the velocity normal to the shock front is reduced , whereas the tangential component of velocity is conserved",
    ". as @xmath139 increases and the shock becomes increasingly oblique , the relative velocity is decreased , and therefore the chondrule heating rate is decreased .",
    "we therefore anticipate a maximum impact parameter for precursors to be melted as chondrules .",
    "this variation of relative velocity with impact parameter is indeed seen in our numerical simulations , as illustrated in figures  [ fig : vel]a ( planetesimal case ) and  [ fig : vel]b ( planetary embryo case ) . in both cases ,",
    "the maximum relative velocity at @xmath144 approaches @xmath143 , and decreases with increasing impact parameter . in the @xmath61 case ,",
    "the relative velocity drops below the critical threshold for melting , @xmath145 , for impact parameters @xmath146 . for the @xmath66 planetary case , on the other hand , particles experience @xmath147 for impact parameters as high as @xmath148 . if the planetary embryo had even higher speed with respect to the gas , this maximum impact parameter would be expanded . because of the slightly irregular shape of the shock front , some regions are not as oblique as [ line - through]*in * others . in the snapshot of figure  [ fig : streamlines]b , for example",
    ", particles with @xmath149 encounter the shock more directly and [ line - through]*also * may experience thermal histories consistent with chondrules . note that even particles with @xmath150 km will be significantly heated ( by a shock with speed @xmath151 ) , but will not be melted as chondrules . comparing the cross sections , the vast majority ( @xmath152 of particles encountered by the bow shock",
    "will be heated , but not melted .",
    "there is generally a maximum impact parameter for which particles are melted as chondrules , but a minimum impact parameter for which particles escape accretion . for a planetesimal with radius @xmath61 , only particles with @xmath153",
    "are heated strongly enough to melt as chondrules .",
    "however , only particles with @xmath154 escape accretion onto the planetesimal . from this",
    "we see that _ all _ particles melted as chondrules in a planetesimal bow shock are accreted onto the planetesimal . for a planetary embryo with radius @xmath66 , on the other hand , all particles with @xmath155 ( possibly up to 6000 km )",
    "are melted as chondrules , whereas only particles with @xmath153 are possibly ( but not necessarily ) accreted .",
    "more than @xmath156 of all particles melted as chondrules in a planetary embryo bow shock escape accretion by the body .",
    "larger bodies will present a larger shock front to incoming particles , increasing the impact parameter out to which chondrules form , and will produce shocks that stand off farther from the body , decreasing the fraction of particles accreted .",
    "one important caveat to the results stated above is that the chondrule trajectories were calculated under the assumption that the gas flow was in steady state .",
    "this assumption is valid for gas as it flows to the shock , and even in the immediate post - shock region , but is manifestly not valid at the boundary where the post - shock gas flows past the planetary atmosphere , since this boundary is strongly affected by kh rolls .",
    "figure  [ fig : streamlines]b makes clear that where chondrules intercept a kh roll ( e.g. , at impact parameters 2000 km and 5000 km ) , the gas flow drives chondrules out of the kh roll .",
    "likewise , at impact parameter @xmath157 km , characterized by the absence of kh rolls , the gas is flowing from the shock front inward , driving chondrules into the void .",
    "thus , there is a tendency for chondrules to  skim \" the boundary surface between the atmosphere and the post - shock gas , although it is difficult to confirm this tendency under the assumption of a steady - state flow .",
    "chondrules in the vicinity of the flow - atmosphere boundary have a range of velocities @xmath158 ( see below ) , while the kh rolls themselves have velocities ( pattern speeds ) on the order of @xmath159 , so that chondrules will probably move in and out of kh rolls , but not at the rates they do so in this calculation , in which the gas flow is kept in steady state .",
    "the trajectories of chondrules determine their density in the chondrule - forming region . in",
    "what follows , we specifically focus on particles that achieved temperatures high enough to melt as chondrules . to be specific",
    ", we consider the particles processed by the planetary embryo bow shock , in figure 2b , which will pass through a slice with @xmath160 near the shock front , with @xmath161 . considering just the subset of those particles that melted as chondrules , they have impact parameters @xmath162 , and pass through @xmath163 .",
    "particles with the lower end of impact parameter ( @xmath164 ) move most slowly , at speeds @xmath165 , and take 2 - 4 hours to reach this region .",
    "chondrules with the higher impact parameter ( @xmath166 ) tend to have speeds @xmath167 and take just under 1 hour to reach this region . on average",
    ", chondrules velocities are reduced from their pre - shock values ( @xmath86 ) by factors @xmath168 , implying that chondrule densities will increase by a factor 2.3 as they slow .",
    "in addition , the chondrules are also seen to be geometrically concentrated as they are funneled into a smaller conical volume [ line - through]*in * past the bow shock .",
    "this increases their density by a factor @xmath169 .",
    "combined , the chondrule density is raised above the background value by a factor of 3.2 . a similar calculation for those particles with impact parameters @xmath170 shows the density of these particles is increased by a similar factor .",
    "these particles will not have achieved the same peak temperatures as those particles with smaller impact parameters , but they will be almost as hot .",
    "for example , if particles with @xmath140 km achieved peak temperatures of 2000 k , and peak temperature scales as @xmath171 , then figure 3b suggests that particles with @xmath172 will have peak temperatures @xmath173 .",
    "the chondrule densities derived above bear on the frequency of compound chondrules .",
    "the mean free path of a chondrule in a sea of chondrules is @xmath174 . for @xmath175 and assuming a compression of a factor of 3.2 in the post - shock region",
    ", we find @xmath176 .",
    "for @xmath177 , the mean free path is 2700 km ( about the radius of the planet ) . within the part of the flow containing chondrules , their velocities range between 1.8 and @xmath178 over a distance 800 km , shorter than the mean free path .",
    "chondrules therefore will collide with other chondrules at relative velocities @xmath179 up to and above that needed to shatter chondrules , which has been estimated to lie in the range @xmath180 ( kring 1991 ) to @xmath181 ( gooding & keil 1981 ) .",
    "we assume a median threshold for shattering of @xmath182 , assert that collisions with chondrules up to ( and beyond ) this speed will occur , and that these will dominate the production of compound chondrules .",
    "the compound chondrule frequency @xmath183 we predict is @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the time for which chondrules remain plastic enough to stick after a collision .",
    "the observed frequency of compound chondrules is reproduced in a planetary embryo bow shock assuming chondrules are concentrated by factors @xmath186 , although the exact percentage will depend on the maximum speed at which chondrules can collide and stick without shattering .",
    "finally , the density of chondrules in the post - shock region will also bear on the optical depths between chondrules and the cool , unshocked gas , which we estimate as follows .",
    "the optical depth is @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the distance between the locations of chondrules and the bow shock , and @xmath189 is the wavelength - integrated absorption cross - section , with @xmath190 in the near - infrared ( li & greenberg 1997 ) . dust evaporates at the shock front , so the opacity is due solely to chondrules ( morris & desch 2010 ) . the number density of chondrules in the background nebular gas is @xmath191 where we have assumed a chondrule radius @xmath175 , an internal density @xmath192 , and defined @xmath193 .",
    "we estimate @xmath188 by considering those chondrules ( objects with @xmath155 ) with most probable impact parameter , @xmath194 .",
    "these chondrules pass @xmath160 at @xmath195 . the particles with the largest impact parameter to be chondrules ( @xmath166 ) pass through @xmath160 at @xmath196 .",
    "importantly , though , even particles with @xmath172 will achieve near - chondrule - like temperatures of 1400 k , and pass through @xmath160 at about @xmath197 .",
    "the unshocked gas lies at @xmath198 at @xmath160 .",
    "thus the typical chondrule lies 250 km from the edge of the cloud of particles shocked enough to melt as chondrules , but 2100 km from the bow shock ( after correcting for the tilt of shock front ) .",
    "we assume chondrules lie 2200 km from the bow shock and consider chondrules to be concentrated above their background value by a factor of 3.2 , to find @xmath199 the gradual spatial transition from shocked chondrules to unshocked gas makes it difficult to define @xmath188 more exactly .",
    "nevertheless , this calculation demonstrates that if chondrules are concentrated by factors of about 10 , then @xmath200 for most chondrules melted by planetary embryo bow shocks .",
    "having calculated the trajectories of chondrules past the planetary embryo , an important goal is to calculate their thermal histories .",
    "these are influenced strongly by the absorption of infrared radiation emitted by nearby chondrules , and by the proximity of a cooler region into which the chondrules can radiate ( without receiving a return of radiation ) . in the previously studied cases of large - scale shocks driven by disk - wide gravitational instabilities ( e.g. , morris & desch 2010 ) , the shock front is planar and the geometry is 1-d .",
    "the cooler region into which chondrules radiate is the pre - shock gas ( ahead of a radiation front ) .",
    "chondrule trajectories are parallel to each other and normal to the shock front , and chondrule properties do not vary in the lateral direction .",
    "in contrast , following melting by a bow shock around a planetesimal or planetary embryo , the cooler region to which chondrules radiate is in the lateral direction , and the shock clearly has a 2-d geometry . the only correct way to calculate chondrule thermal histories is to compute the fully 2-d radiation field in cylindrical geometry , but the chondrule trajectories displayed in figure  [ fig : streamlines]b suggest that a perturbation to the 1-d chondrule thermal histories may yield an adequate solution .",
    "first , the particles are seen to flow in a more or less laminar fashion , without crossing paths .",
    "this suggests that chondrule thermal histories are a function of distance past the shock front , as in the 1-d example .",
    "second , chondrules on parallel trajectories do not differ from each other significantly . as stated above",
    ", it takes about 3 hours for chondrules with the lowest initial impact parameter ( @xmath164 ) , and about 1 hour for chondrules with the highest impact parameter ( @xmath166 ) , to reach a certain representative point downstream ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "we show below that typical chondrule cooling rates are roughly @xmath201 , so that at this location all chondrules are within about 100 k of each other .",
    "compared to the typical chondrule temperature at this location ( @xmath202 ) , this difference is not significant .",
    "third , these properties hold even as the particles move downstream by roughly 20,000 km ( not shown in figure  [ fig : streamlines]b ) .",
    "further downstream , rarefaction of the shocked gas is presumed to take place",
    ". indeed , some hints of this are seen in the slightly diverging chondrule trajectories in figure  [ fig : streamlines]b , but this does not affect the gross geometry . certainly the flow remains basically the same for at least the 5 hours it takes for chondrules in our simulations to cool below their solidus temperatures .",
    "these facts suggest that a simple alteration to the 1-d code of morris & desch ( 2010 ) , to allow for loss of energy by radiation into the unshocked gas , may allow a useful estimate of chondrule thermal histories .",
    "we accommodate for radiative losses in an approximate way using the formulation of morris et al.(2010a , b ) . specifically , we conduct a 1-d simulation as in morris & desch ( 2010 ) , based on desch & connolly ( 2002 ) , including emission , absorption , and transfer of continuum radiation from solids , and the molecular radiation from @xmath56 , dissociation and recombination of @xmath67 molecules , and evaporation of small particles .",
    "however , we replace the 1-d radiation field @xmath203 seen by chondrules with one that is a mixture of the local 1-d radiation field and the radiation field they see from the cool gas on the other side of the bow shock . to calculate this mixed radiation field , we consider chondrules to lie in one of two semi - infinite spaces separated by a plane , which represents the bow shock .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : streamlines]b , chondrules tend to move very close to , and parallel to , the shock front .",
    "we assume they all remain at a fixed optical depth @xmath38 from the bow shock . on the unshocked side of the bow shock",
    ", we assume the temperature is that of the background nebula , @xmath204 . on the other side",
    "lies heated chondrules , and the hot ( @xmath205 ) gas in the planetary embryo s wake .",
    "the column density across the wake region is @xmath206 , which for a solar - composition gas yields a column density of water molecules @xmath207 , which is optically thick in the infrared ( morris et al .",
    "in addition , gas that might contain dust is mixed into the wake region , especially at @xmath208 .",
    "this justifies the assumption of a semi - infinite space at high temperature , which we assume is the local temperature of chondrules , @xmath209 .",
    "making these assumptions , it is straightforward to show that chondrules see a radiation field with mean intensity @xmath210 \\ , { \\rm e}_{2}(\\tau),\\ ] ] where @xmath211 is the planck radiation function and @xmath212 is the second exponential integral .",
    "we replace the radiation field seen by chondrules with this quantity , where @xmath38 is an input parameter describing the optical depth between the chondrules and the gas .",
    "we note that the previous work of morris et al .",
    "( 2010a , b ) differed in two ways . in that work ,",
    "@xmath213 was approximated by @xmath214 , which is a reasonably good assumption .",
    "that work also assumed the wake of the planetesimal was _ not _ optically thick , so that @xmath214 was used instead of the more appropriate @xmath213 used here .",
    "because of these differences , cooling rates are roughly an order of magnitude slower here than found by morris et al .",
    "( 2010a , b ) .",
    "as discussed above in  3 , we consider @xmath215 to be a typical value for those particles that melt as chondrules ( impact parameters from 400 to 4300 km ) , provided @xmath186 . based on this , @xmath216 , meaning that the radiation field seen by chondrules is roughly 69% the radiation field they would normally see in the 1-d shock ,",
    "mixed with 31% of the background radiation field .",
    "chondrules are warmed by the radiation field from nearby chondrules , but not as much as they would be in a 1-d shock .",
    "we now consider the possible effects of h@xmath21o line cooling in this case .",
    "morris & desch ( 2010 ) found that molecular line cooling due to h@xmath21o was negligible in large scale shocks , due to the combined effects of high column densities of water seconds after the shock , backwarming , and , most importantly , @xmath67 recombinations .",
    "however , we must consider whether line cooling would become significant in the geometry of a bow shock . recall from above that the column density of water molecules across the wake region is @xmath207 , so the region is optically thick to line photons shortly after the shock ( morris et al",
    ".  2009 ) .",
    "not only is the wake region optically thick to line photons , but the high column density of water also tends to block continuum radiation escaping through the wake region .",
    "although the effects of backwarming may be reduced somewhat due to the bow shock geometry , buffering by @xmath67 recombinations will be unaffected .",
    "the combination of high column densities of water and buffering by @xmath67 recombinations will dominate over any reduction in the efficiency of backwarming due to the geometry .",
    "therefore , we still consider h@xmath21o line cooling negligible in bow shocks .    in figure 5 ,",
    "the thermal histories of chondrules are shown for four possible values of the shock speed : @xmath217 , @xmath137 , @xmath218 and @xmath86 . in each case",
    "chondrules are heated by absorbing infrared radiation emitted by other chondrules in the vicinity , by thermal exchange with the gas in the post - shock region , and by frictional heating in the minute or so past the shock where the chondrules move at supersonic speeds @xmath126 , with respect to the gas .",
    "as described above , the radiation field seen by chondrules has been artifically lowered from the radiation field they would normally see , using the factor @xmath219 ( @xmath220 ) .",
    "the peak temperature is sensitive to the supersonic heating rate , which scales as @xmath136 ( up to the liquidus temperature ) , and strongly correlates with shock speed .",
    "we find @xmath221 for @xmath217 , @xmath222 for @xmath223 , @xmath224 for @xmath225 , and @xmath224 for @xmath85 .",
    "note that thermal histories become increasingly uncertain for times @xmath226 hours ( i.e. , for temperatures @xmath227 k ) because the assumption of a 1-d geometry becomes increasingly less valid .",
    "chondrule peak temperatures must exceed 1770 - 2120 k to produce porphyritic textures ( hewins & connolly 1996 ; desch & connolly 2002 ) .",
    "formation of chondrules therefore requires @xmath228 , or @xmath138 .",
    "for the runs where peak temperatures were sufficient to melt the chondrules , the cooling rates through the crystallization temperature range ( @xmath229 , desch & connolly 2002 ) were @xmath230 ( the cooling rate for chondrules in the shock with @xmath223 did not begin to cool slowly until their temperatures dropped below @xmath231 ) . if we repeat our calculations with @xmath232 , we recover the optically thick , 1-d limit for which cooling rates are @xmath230 . if we reduce @xmath16 below 10 , the chondrule cooling rates increase .",
    "they may not increase significantly if the wake region remains optically thick , but if it does not , then @xmath233 leads to cooling rates @xmath234 ( morris et al .",
    "2009 ) . from all this",
    ", we conclude that both peak temperatures and cooling rates are consistent with formation of porphyritic textures of chondrules , provided shocks speeds are @xmath235 ( @xmath147 ) , and @xmath236 .",
    "lower particle concentrations may also be consistent with cooling rates @xmath237 , although we have not tested this .",
    "the required shock speeds are obtained so long as the planetary embryo has sufficient orbital eccentricity and/or inclination .    because cooling rates are sensitive to chondrule concentrations @xmath16 , it is worth considering likely values of @xmath16 as well as the lengthscales over which such concentrations are achieved .",
    "one mechanism that may lead to a high concentration of chondrules is settling to the midplane , which is inferred observationally in certain young protoplanetary disks ( furlan et al .",
    "2011 ) . in this scenario , the level of turbulence at the midplane is low enough that chondrules have a scale height @xmath238 significantly smaller than the scale height @xmath239 of the gas .",

    "if @xmath258 then chondrules will concentrate to the midplane .    if the turbulent viscosity of the disk is dominated by the magnetorotational instability , it is possible , but not certain , that @xmath240 may be low enough at the midplane to allow chondrules to settle .",
    "even low values of @xmath240 are insufficient to allow chondrules to settle : for @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 ( for @xmath262 ) and @xmath263 , signifying relatively good mixing of chondrules with the gas .",
    "to obtain @xmath177 requires @xmath264 , so that @xmath265 , @xmath266 and @xmath267 , implying significant settling to the midplane .",
    "chondrule concentrations would then be 10 times their background nebular values , over a thickness @xmath268 .",
    "this analysis is complicated by the possibility that a significant fraction of the solids mass may be locked up in large planetesimals .",
    "if half of the solids mass is locked up in planetesimals , the same optical depths in the chondrule - forming region require chondrules to be concentrated by a factor of 20 instead of 10 , which would require @xmath269 so that @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "if 90% of the solids mass is locked up in planetesimals , the same optical depths would require a concentration by a factor of 100 instead of 10 , which would require @xmath272 so that @xmath273 .",
    "it is not clear what value of @xmath240 is appropriate at the midplanes of protoplanetary disks in which the magnetorotational instability can not act at the midplane . in principle , lower values are possible ( e.g. , turner et al .",
    "2010 ) , but values @xmath274 are thought to be appropriate ( fleming & stone 2003 ) , which would make it difficult for significant concentrations of chondrules to be achieved .",
    "turbulence itself provides a second mechanism for concentrating chondrules .",
    "cuzzi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) demonstrated that particles with an aerodynamic stopping time equal to the turnover time of the kolmogorov - scale eddies , can be concentrated in the stagnant zones between turbulent eddies .",
    "particles with this stopping time have a size @xmath275 the molecular viscosity @xmath276 , where @xmath277 is given by sutherland s formula . following the discussion in desch ( 2007 ) , and assuming a solar composition gas with @xmath253 and the parameters above , we calculate @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "for @xmath280 we determine the size of particles necessary for concentration is @xmath281 .",
    "chondrule precursors with radius @xmath11 , as we have assumed in our model , have almost the exact size to be optimally concentrated .",
    "particle concentrations @xmath282 are easily achieved ( cuzzi & hogan 2003 ) .    even if a significant fraction of the mass of solids is locked up in large planetesimals , there will be many regions in the nebula that have these concentrations of chondrule precursors .",
    "for example , in nebular gas with @xmath280 , nearly 80% of all chondrule precursors are in regions where their densities are concentrated by factors of 10 above background values , 70% are in regions with concentrations 20 times their background density , and 20% are in regions with concentrations 100 times their background density ( cuzzi et al .",
    "2001 ) . of course",
    ", only small fractions of the _ volume _ of the nebula see concentrations this high , but these regions are where most chondrule precursors reside .",
    "the lengthscale over which a concentration @xmath16 is achieved roughly scales as @xmath283 ( cuzzi & hogan 2003 ) , so even regions with @xmath284 are @xmath285 in extent and thus wider than the planetary embryo bow shock itself .",
    "we are justified in assuming a uniform value of @xmath16 when computing chondrule thermal histories .",
    "note that while a planetary embryo will pass through clumps with @xmath286 , with sizes @xmath287 , in only 3 - 0.3 hours , the newly - formed chondrules remain in the vicinity of each other . to fix ideas , we assume that half of the solids mass is locked in large planetesimals , so that the optical depths assumed in the thermal histories above requires concentrations by factors of 20 , which are achieved over regions 50,000 km in extent , which contain 70% of all chondrule precursors . if the planetary embryo is on an orbit eccentric and/or inclined enough to yield shock speeds @xmath288 , the chondrule precursors in these clumps would be melted and would cool in a manner consistent with the dominant porphyritic textures .",
    "we now consider the formation environment experienced by chondrules in bow shocks around planetary embryos , which we expect to be quite different from the environment in planetesimal bow shocks .",
    "dauphas & pourmand ( 2011 ) have suggested that mars accreted roughly half its mass within @xmath289 after the formation of cais .",

    "this is in line with similar rates of kh stripping in other examples of strongly bound gas ( e.g. , around protoplanetary disks ; ouellette et al .  2007 ) .",
    "this is sufficiently rapid to deplete the atmosphere after about 600 years , but outgassing can continue to replenish the atmosphere as the magma ocean convects ( on shorter timescales ) and bring new volatiles to the surface . the planetary inventory of water , in particular , in this example could persist for @xmath319 .",

    "this could potentially affect chondrule thermal histories in two ways : during the first minute past the shock front , higher gas densities can more rapidly decelerate the chondrule and heat it by friction ; and thermal exchange with the hot gas will become more efficient . neither of these effects is likely to drastically alter the thermal histories of the chondrules considered here , because nearly all of the chondrule deceleration takes place in the shocked nebula gas during the first minute , outside of the planetary atmosphere ( see figure  [ fig : streamlines]b ) .",
    "also , the denser plumes of gas are not likely to be at significantly different temperatures , and chondrule temperatures will be dominated by radiative effects .",

    "below , we discuss the methods for including torques and drag , in turn , and then combine them to estimate the orbital evolution and mass of chondrules processed .",

    "higher initial eccentricities and lower initial inclinations favor greater chondrule formation in both concentration scenarios . note that when planetary bodies are scattered out of the plane of the disk , the potential chondrule - forming _ duration _ is greatly extended because gas drag is only effective near the orbital nodes ; however , chondrules would only be produced at the orbital nodes , so the longer duration does not necessarily equate to more mass processed . comparing the cases where chondrules are concentrated by turbulence vs. settled to the midplane , the total mass of chondrules is comparable when the planetary embryo has high inclination ,",
    "whereas if the inclination is low ( @xmath420 ) , a greater mass of chondrules is produced when chondrules settle to the midplane .",

    "provided the body is large enough to actually produce chondrules ( i.e. , it is not a planetesimal for which chondrules are accreted , but is a large planetary embryo ) , the cross section @xmath407 scales roughly as @xmath424 .",
    "the product of this cross section and @xmath425 yields the total mass of chondrules produced . for small bodies",

    "in fact , the mass of chondrules that can be produced per embryo is optimal for mars - sized bodies with @xmath427 .",
    "nevertheless , as long as the body is larger than about 1000 km in radius , a comparable amount ( to within factors of 3 ) of chondrules will be produced .",
    "the chondrule masses produced per embryo are intriguingly close to the mass @xmath35 , and in principle a single scattered planetary embryo could produce the entire present - day inventory of chondrules . nevertheless , to produce the observed mass of chondrules several planetary embryos probably would be required .",
    "this is because some of the solids mass is locked up in large bodies , making fewer chondrule precursors available for processing . also , the present - day asteroid belt may have been depleted since it formed , meaning there were more chondrules originally , potentially by a factor of 100 ( weidenschilling 1977 ) .",
    "on the other hand , eccentric planetary embryos may be a common event .",
    "even for the minimum - mass solar nebula mass distribution assumed above , the annulus between 1.5 and 2.5 au would have contained @xmath428 of solids .",
    "if half of the mass was in small ( chondrule - like ) particles and half locked up in large planetary embryos , potentially @xmath429 planetary embryos could exist in that one annulus alone .",
    "our calculations show that , given the right orbital parameters , chondrules can form over a range of heliocentric distances 1.0 - 2.5 au .",
    "chondrules embedded in a disk with even low levels of turbulence may be spread over lengthscales @xmath430 in @xmath431 , assuming an alpha viscosity law @xmath432 ( where @xmath239 is the gas scale height , @xmath242 the keplerian orbital frequency and @xmath240 a dimensionless constant @xmath433 ; hartmann et al .",
    "chondrules produced at 1.0 - 2.5 au will relatively quickly be spread throughout the present - day asteroid belt to be incorporated into chondrite parent bodies .",
    "following the recent discovery that a planetary embryo , the half - formed mars , existed at the same time chondrules were forming ( dauphas & pourmond 2011 ) , we have been motivated to study chondrule formation in the bow shocks of planetary embryos on eccentric orbits .",

    "moreover , a concentration factor of @xmath177 yields a compound chondrule frequency in accord with observations . to achieve the same optical depths in bow shocks around planetesimals requires much higher concentrations of chondrules .",
