    "this @xmath1-ferh chemically ordered alloy ( henceforth termed ferh here ) is an antiferromagnet ( af ) that exhibits a first - order transition to become a ferromagnet ( fm ) around @xmath2  k  @xcite . on heating ,",
    "the metamagnetic transition between the two different but both fully ordered magnetic states ( type ii af  @xcite and fm ) is accompanied by an isotropic 1% volume expansion  @xcite , a large entropy release  @xcite , and a large drop in the resistivity  @xcite .",
    "the metamagnetic transition temperature is highly sensitive to the composition @xmath3 in fe@xmath4rh@xmath5  @xcite and chemical doping  @xcite , @xmath6 decreases with increased applied magnetic field  @xcite and increases with the application of pressure  @xcite .",
    "neutron diffraction  @xcite and more recently xmcd measurements  @xcite indicate that part of the 3.3@xmath7 magnetic moment centred on the fe in the af phase is transferred to the rh in the fm phase with , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the curie temperature for the high - temperature fm phase is @xmath10  k  @xcite , comparable to the curie temperature of alloys with @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the transition also occurs in epitaxially - grown and polycrystalline ferh thin films  @xcite , albeit usually with a wider temperature hysteresis ( @xmath12  k instead of the @xmath13  k usual for bulk specimens ) .",
    "thin films of ferh have been of much recent interest because of a potential application in heat - assisted high - density magnetic recording , taking advantage of the extremely fast switching ( within a few ps ) from af to fm that can be achieved with ultrashort laser pulses  @xcite .",
    "further research on ferh thin films is now focussed at tuning the transition towards specific applications , by growing epitaxially on a variety of substrates and in heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "there is an ongoing debate about the origin of this magneto - structural and electronic transition  @xcite .",
    "competing explanations suggest the transition is driven either by thermal lattice expansions and lattice instabilities  @xcite , changes in the electronic density of states at the fermi surface  @xcite and changes in the magnetic entropy due to an increase in magnon modes in the fm state with respect to the af state  @xcite . in recent work , using an empirical model , it was suggested the transition arises from entropy changes related to both volume - per - atom and magnetic moment degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "recent hard x - ray photoemission measurements  @xcite , which are sensitive to the bulk of the thin film , have revealed large quantitative as well as qualitative changes in the electronic structure at the af - fm transition .",
    "this is in line with heat capacity measurements that reveal a clear change of the sommerfeld coefficient at the transition , signifying a change in the density of states at the fermi level  @xcite . in this case",
    "a large change in the carrier density might also be expected at the transition .",
    "hall - effect measurements , with which such a change in carrier density could be quantified , could therefore decide whether the entropy release , and hence the origin of the transition , is electronic or not .",
    "surprisingly , hall - effect data are presently only available for the fm state in ni - doped ferh . here , we report further characterisation of the change in the electronic properties at the metamagnetic transition , quantifying the change in carrier density at the transition using hall - effect and magnetoresistance ( mr ) measurements on ferh epilayers . we show that the carrier density in the af phase is anomalously low for a metal , and that it depends on the degree of fe@xmath14rh antisite disorder , with each pair of interchanged atoms yielding two electrons as current carriers .",
    "the samples we studied were ( 001)-oriented epilayers of ferh , of thickness @xmath15 in the range 30 - 50 nm , grown on ( 001 ) mgo substrates .",
    "they were grown using dc sputter deposition from a single fe@xmath16rh@xmath17 target at 870  k , at a rate of @xmath18   / s .",
    "the ferh film composition differs slightly from that of the sputter target , and is closer to 50:50 at% .",
    "prior to deposition , the mgo substrates were heated overnight at 970  k , with the vacuum in the chamber rising to @xmath19  torr .",
    "the background pressure during growth was typically @xmath20  torr .",
    "hence , ar with 4% h@xmath21 was used as sputter gas to avoid sample oxidation during growth",
    ". samples with different degrees of substitutional disorder , expressed in the order parameter @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the ratio of the fe ( rh ) located on the fe ( rh ) site ) , were obtained by subsequent in - vacuum annealing at temperatures @xmath25 up to 1070 k. chemically disordered ferh is effectively bcc , for which the ( 001 ) bragg reflection is forbidden , while fully cscl - ordered ferh is cubic primitive , for which the ( 001 ) reflection is allowed .",
    "the order parameter @xmath26 is thus obtained from x - ray diffraction using @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the experimental and theoretical intensities of the ( 00@xmath30 ) bragg reflection , respectively  @xcite . for the calculation of the theoretical intensities",

    "[ fig : transition](a ) shows the field dependence of the longitudinal resistivity ( @xmath38 ) of sample b. there are three characteristic features in these data : the transition is clearly observable as a drop in @xmath38 by a factor of @xmath39 as usual ; there is a sizable hysteresis for temperature and magnetic fields sweeping up and down as expected for a first order transition ; and the transition moves to lower fields at higher temperatures at the usual rate of about 8  k / t .",

    "[ fig : transition](b ) shows the simultaneously measured hall resistivity @xmath40 . from the @xmath41 data taken at 293 , 314 and 334 k",
    "it is clear that in the low - field af phase the hall resistivity varies linearly with field , with a large negative hall coefficient .",
    "this arises from the ordinary hall effect , with transport dominated by @xmath42 electron - like carriers per unit cell and a room temperature mobility @xmath43  @xmath44/vs for sample b. this carrier density is anomalously low , about an order of magnitude smaller than is usual for transition metals .",
    "no change in the carrier density could be detected within the af state down to 100 k. below this temperature the carrier density gradually falls , with at 2  k 70% of the value at 100  k.

    "[ fig : transition],width=453 ]    in contrast , in the fm phase @xmath49 is markedly non - linear in @xmath50 .",
    "the sharp increase of @xmath49 with increasing field at the edges of the hysteretic transition region is attributed to onset of the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) as the sample becomes fm and the moment is pulled out - of - plane in the applied field . beyond that , @xmath49 continues to vary its slope with respect to field , asymptotically approaching a value constant in @xmath50 .",
    "[ fig : transition](c ) shows the field dependence of the hall coefficient @xmath51 . from dc susceptibility data in the fm state and in large fields",
    "it was confirmed that the out - of - plane moment saturates at 2  t , indicating that changes in the hall coefficient in larger fields are not due to the anomalous hall effect .",
    "it is clear that the magnitude of the hall coefficient drops by nearly an order of magnitude from @xmath52 to @xmath53@xmath54/c across the transition , shown by two arrows for the 314 k data ( the rapid varation of @xmath46 within the hysteretic regime is not shown for clarity ) . in the fm phase @xmath46 becomes smaller by at least another order of magnitude and further decreases with increasing field .",
    "this dramatic change in @xmath46 on fully entering the fm phase , to values that are typical for transition metals , is much larger than the relatively small changes observed at the onset of charge - density / spin - density wave af order in bcc cr@xcite .",
    "while a single @xmath46 is obtained for all the data in the af phase on this sample , in the fm phase the particular field dependence of @xmath46 depends on the distance from the af - fm transition , rather than the actual field ; at each temperature measured , @xmath55 is shifted along the field axis . fitting the measured @xmath55 with",
    "the usual two - band model  @xcite will in this case clearly lead to arbitrary , temperature dependent results and we conclude that the only information we can take from this data is that in the fm phase @xmath56 as @xmath50 increases . within the two - band model  @xcite , a vanishing @xmath46 points to two types of carrier , with mobilities that are opposite but equal in magnitude , i.e. @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the mr will then be @xmath59 , so that the mobility and carrier density can in ideal cases still be obtained .",
    "the mr for sample b in the fm phase at 377 k is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : comp](a ) alongside the typical mr for sample b in the af phase at 100  k , sample a ( with an fm ground state ) , and sample c ( af at 100  k ) .",
    "it is interesting that the mr is negative in the fm state of sample b , as for the fm sample a , as usual due to the suppression of magnon - scattering in a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "hence the two - band model can in this case not be used to extract the actual carrier densities and mobilities in the fm phase .",
    "it is clear , however , that in the fm regime transport is dominated by these newly released carriers , implying an order of magnitude increase in carrier density at least , to values of @xmath31 carrier per unit cell , as is normal for metals . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp](b ) the hall resistivities of samples a , b , and c are compared . neglecting the steep rise in the hall resistivity up to @xmath31  t for sample a ( and b ) due to the ahe",
    ", @xmath49 increases linearly for sample a with @xmath60  @xmath61/c corresponding to a single type of carrier , with @xmath62 hole - like carriers per unit cell .",
    "this is in contrast to the high - field gradient in @xmath45 for sample b in the high - temperature fm state , which is almost vanishing .",
    "the carrier density for fm sample a is comparable to that of bcc fe , with approximately 2 hole - like carriers per fe@xcite , and is independent of temperature between 4 and 250  k.     ( b ) in the ferromagnetic sample a , in the af and fm states for sample b and in the af state for sample c. [ fig : comp],width=377 ]    not only is the carrier density in the af phase anomalously low , but it is found to vary with the concentration of antisite substitution defects . for sample c in the antiferromagnetic state @xmath63 is roughly twice as large as for sample b , with @xmath64  @xmath61  c and between 0.07 and 0.11 electron - like carriers per unit cell .",
    "the variation in the slope of @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp](b ) is slightly greater for sample c than for sample b ( where it is almost perfectly constant ) , and the mr of sample c is twice as large as for sample b ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp](a ) ) .",
    "the variation in the gradient of @xmath65 is ascribed to a small concentration of secondary carriers , which given the reduced number of majority carriers now make up a larger fraction .",
    "given that the fe / rh substitution defect concentration in sample c is @xmath66% of that of sample b ( table  [ table : samples ] ) , a natural explanation for the large difference in carrier densities measured in the af phase is that the majority carriers in this phase arise from the native doping due to fe / rh antisite substitution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nvss ] the hall resistivity is shown to be correlated with the order parameter @xmath26 in data from these and four additional samples .",
    "the trend revealed is fairly close to two electron - like carriers per pair of atoms substituted , and confirms that the majority of carriers in the af phase arise from native doping due to substitutional disorder .",
    "while samples with varying thicknesses were used ( see table  [ table : samples ] ) , no thickness dependence was observed and so we assume that the observations reported here are likely to be equally applicable to bulk samples .     as a function of the fe / rh sublattice order parameter @xmath26 for each of the six samples of ferh .",
    "the dashed line shows a 1:1 negative correlation between these quantities as a guide to the eye.,width=302 ]    no dependence of carrier density on sample disorder was observed in the high - temperature fm phase ; the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition ] for sample b are representative of the hall response in the high - temperature phase of ferh .",
    "the dramatic changes in the hall coefficient observed at the transition , revealing a sub - metallic carrier density in the af phase , leave little doubt that most of the entropy release at the transition arises from an increase in carriers , tied to an increase in the density - of - states at the fermi level .",
    "because phase transitions are driven by an increase in entropy , this firmly establishes that , as suggested earlier  @xcite , the transition is driven by a profound change in the electronic structure .",
    "it should be noted that the change in electronic structure can not be explained as a slater - type transition  @xcite . in the slater transition part of the fermi surface",
    "is gapped out with the doubling of the brillouin zone when already antiferromagnetically coupled spins order in a long - range - ordered antiferromagnetic nel state on cooling . in ferh",
    "the high - temperature phase is ferromagnetic , leaving the appearance of antiferromagnetism itself unexplained in a slater - type scenario .",
    "as this hall - effect data confirms , it is electronic ordering of some kind on cooling through the transition that gives rise to the change in magnetic exchange from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic .    that the volume expansion at the transition on heating is only a secondary effect",
    "is also brought out from other recent experiments on thin films .",
    "ferh grown epitaxially on mgo has a tetragonal unit cell and expansion of the cell at the transition is only along the axis perpendicular to the film surface  @xcite .",
    "if the transition arose as a result of a volume instability it would be very unlikely that it persists in a system where the ( isotropic in bulk ) volume expansion is restricted to one dimension only .",
    "furthermore , that the fm state can be induced within a few ps with a short laser pulse , well before the thermal energy from the laser pulse can dissipate to the crystal lattice  @xcite , implies that the transition is not driven by a structural instability .",
    "one could then speculate about the nature of the electronic transition and our hall data provide a few further hints in this respect .",
    "a conductivity dominated by defect carriers in the low - temperature state with a well - defined transition to a metallic - like state on heating , as observed here for ferh , is reminiscent of the case of nis .",
    "this compound has a metal to non - metal transition accompanied by a magnetic ordering transition at 265  k  @xcite .",
    "hall measurements revealed that in the non - metal phase the number of carriers scales with the number of ni vacancies in the lattice , with two hole - like carriers per ni vacancy  @xcite .",
    "there is of course one crucial difference ; for nis it is clear that removal of a charge - neutral ni - atom from a ni@xmath67 site creates two hole - like carriers .",
    "how in ferh carriers arise due to substitution defects while the stoichiometry of the compound is unchanged is not _ a priori _ clear and deserves further attention .",
    "the fact that in nis a mott - like transition occurs  @xcite despite the presence of carriers , resulting in a semimetal low - temperature state , suggests that a similar possibility might be open for ferh . in general , a mott transition  @xcite can occur in materials with a half - filled @xmath68 or @xmath69 band that would according to band - theory be metals ; the strong coulomb - repulsion between the @xmath68 or @xmath69 electrons leads to a splitting of this band into two mott - hubbard bands .",
    "these bands are separated by a mott - hubbard energy gap , causing insulating behaviour with localized unpaired spins if the lower band is full and the upper band is empty . the unpaired localised spins in mott insulators are generally coupled antiferromagnetically  @xcite .",
    "as indicated by the near - linear field dependence of the hall resistivity in the af phase and the correlation with substitutional disorder the carrier density in a disorder - free sample would be very small .",
    "an estimate using the two - band model gives @xmath70 carriers per unit cell .",
    "this implies a strong rearrangement of the fe 4@xmath71 and rh 4@xmath68 and 5@xmath71 bands , as has previously been predicted  @xcite .",
    "it has recently become clear that in the case of weak hybridisation between a strongly - correlated band ( in this case the fe @xmath0 band ) and other ( conduction ) bands can lead to a _ selective _ mott transition  @xcite . in this scenario the localisation of fe @xmath0 electrons in ferh due to the mott mechanism is unaffected by the presence of other bands crossing the fermi energy ; defect bands arising from substitution defects or fe @xmath72 and rh @xmath73 and @xmath74 bands .",
    "an orbital - selective mott transition has for example been suggested to occur in the heavy - fermion intermetallic compound ybrh@xmath21si@xmath21  @xcite ; at low temperatures the yb @xmath75 moments order antiferromagnetically , and in hall effect measurements on this material a large discontinuity in the carrier density is observed at the field - induced kondo - breakdown quantum - critical point , beyond which the `` anderson impurity '' @xmath75 moments are screened by the conduction electrons .",
    "an orbital - selective mott transition at the af - fm transition in ferh , selective to the fe @xmath0 orbitals , could also provide a natural explanation for the confluence of @xmath76 and @xmath77 observed above the transition .",
    "the situation is then that the transport is dominated by a single half - filled conduction band with hopping - like conductivity for both the electrons and the holes - an exciton gas  @xcite .",
    "mott  @xcite suggested that this is the high - temperature metallic state in a metal - insulator transition .",
    "however , as is clear from the ni - doped ferh data  @xcite , which does not show the exciton gas - like behaviour , the vanishing @xmath46 in the high - temperature hall data in ferh may not be uniquely linked to the af - fm transition .",
    "finally , the ( selective ) mott mechanism would provide a natural mechanism for the change of magnetic exchange between the fe @xmath0 moments .",
    "antiferromagnetism is favoured for the localized fe @xmath0 electrons in the low - temperature phase , while for delocalized electrons coulomb repulsions between the electrons can give rise to ferromagnetism by the stoner mechanism  @xcite , which is responsible for this type of order in the @xmath0 ferromagnets such as fe .",
    "in conclusion , comprehensive hall effect measurements on @xmath1-ferh reveal a dramatic reduction in carrier density to a sub - metallic value on cooling through the metamagnetic transition into the af phase .",
    "the drop is over an order of magnitude , meaning that whole bands could be disappearing , rather than that a fraction of a fermi surface being gapped out .",
    "furthermore , the carrier density in the low - temperature af phase is found to be dominated by a defect band related to fe / rh substitution defects .",
    "these observations establish that the metamagnetic transition in ferh is driven by an electronic transition .",
    "one possibility , consistent with all the experimental features we observe , is that the electronic transition is in fact a mott transition selective to strongly - correlated fe @xmath0 electrons .",
