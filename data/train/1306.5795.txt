    "recent observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) have shown that color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of globular clusters ( gcs ) are very different from our classical expectations of razor - thin sequences characteristic of single , old populations of stars . in particular , _ hst _ near - uv data has shown that most , if not all , gcs host multiple stellar populations , as evidenced by two or more intertwined sequences in the cmd that we can trace from the main sequence ( ms ) , through the sub - giant branch ( sgb ) , up the red - giant branch ( rgb ) and even along the horizontal branch ( hb ) .",
    "> from studies of several clusters , we have found that the different sequences can vary their color separation or even invert their relative colors , depending on the photometric - band combinations .",
    "these sequences correspond to stellar populations that have different abundances of light elements and helium .",
    "a comparison of the photometry with synthetic spectra can provide unique opportunities to estimate the helium content among the stellar populations ( e.g.  milone et al .",
    "2012a ) , even at the level of faint ms stars , which are unreachable by spectroscopic investigations .    the cluster analysed in this paper , ngc288 , is already known to host two populations of stars characterized by difference in light - element abundance ( e.g.  shetrone & keane 2000 , kayser et al .",

    ", we combine new _ hst _ observations with archival data to investigate the evolutionary path of the multiple populations in ngc288 along the ms , sgb , and rgb . by exploring a wide wavelength region , ranging from the ultraviolet ( @xmath02750 ) to the near infrared ( @xmath08140 )",
    ", we will estimate the helium difference between the two main populations .",
    "to get the broadest possible perspective on ngc288 s multiple populations , we consolidated photometry from a large number of _ hst _ images taken with the wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs / wfc ) and the ultraviolet / visible channel of the wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3/uvis ) .",
    "table  1 gives a list of the data sets we used .",
    "most _ hst _ data are from the archive , with the exception of the proprietary images from go-12605 ( pi :  piotto ) , which were specifically taken for this project and are crucial for its success .",
    "photometric and astrometric measurements of acs / wfc exposures were obtained with the software program described by anderson et al .",
    "this routine produces a catalog of stars over the field of view by analyzing an entire set of images simultaneously .",
    "it measures stellar fluxes independently in each exposure by means of a spatially variable point - spread - function model ( see anderson & king 2006 ) , along with a spatially - constant perturbation of the psf to account for the effects of focus variations .",

    "astrometry and photometry were corrected for pixel area and geometric distortion as in bellini & bedin ( 2009 ) , and bellini , anderson & bedin ( 2011 ) .",
    "there are a few filters for which filter - specific distortion solutions are not yet available . for these filters ( f395n , f467 m , and f547 m )",
    ", we applied the solution for the closest available filter .",
    "this introduces small ( 0.05 pixel ) errors in astrometry and negligible errors in photometry .    since the main results of this paper require high - precision photometry , we limited our analysis to the sub - sample of stars well measured .",
    "the software routine provides several quality indexes that can be used as diagnostics of the reliability of photometric measurements : i ) the rms of the individual position measurements about their mean , after they have been measured in different exposures and transformed into a common reference frame ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , ii ) @xmath4 , the ratio between the estimated flux of the star in a 0.5 arcsec aperture and the flux from neighbor stars that has spilled over into the same aperture ) , and iii ) @xmath5 , the residuals to the psf fit for each star ( see anderson et al .",

    "the ms ridge line is marked in red . to determine it , we started by selecting a sample of ms stars by means of a hand - drawn",
    ", first - guess ridge line .",
    "we calculated the median color and the median magnitude of ms stars in bins that were 0.3 magnitude tall .",
    "we then interpolated these median points with a spline , and did an iterated sigma - clipping of the verticalized ms ( middle panel ) .",
    "in order to obtain the verticalized ms of the middle panel , we subtracted from each star the color of the fiducial line at the same f275w magnitude level , obtaining a @xmath14 ( @xmath7 ) value .",

    "hereafter , these colors will be consistently used to distinguish the msa and msb populations and their post - ms progeny . from the areas under the gaussians we estimate that 54@xmath153% of the stars belong to the msa and 46@xmath153% to msb .",

    "it separates rgba stars ( on the bottom - left side ) from rgbb stars ( on the upper - right side ) .",

    "[ rgbratio ] , while panel ( c ) shows the histogram of the @xmath14(@xmath8 ) distribution .",
    "the histogram is fitted with the sum of two gaussians , again colored in green and magenta as above . from the area under the gaussians we calculated that rgba stars include 57@xmath155% rgb stars , with the remaining 43@xmath155% stars populating the rgbb . in this case",
    ", we simply associated a poisson error to the fraction of stars in each population . within one sigma uncertainty ,",

    "our previous studies of 47tuc and ngc6397 have demonstrated that any two - color diagram made from the combination of a near - ultraviolet filter ( such as f225w or f275w ) , the f336w filter , and a blue filter ( such as f390w , f435w , or f438w ) is particularly efficient at disentangling stellar populations with different ligh - element abundances ( milone et al.2012a , c ) .",

    "the histogram distributions of [ na / fe ] for rgba ( green histogram ) and rgbb stars ( magenta histogram ) are shown in panel ( e ) .",
    "similar to what is observed in the other gcs studied with a similar approach , we find that population ` a ' stars are na - poor and o - rich , in contrast to population ` b ' stars , which are depleted in oxygen and enhanced in sodium .      by combining archive and proprietary data , we have access to eleven different photometric bands to build cmds for ngc 288 .",
    "we used the uv and blue photometry displayed in figs .",
    "[ cmds ] to select the members of population a and b , and then plotted their positions in the cmds obtained with all possible color combinations .",
    "uv photometry has proven to be essential to separate the two populations , because of its sensitivity to light - element variations ( marino et al .",
    "on the other hand , optical cmds are sensitive to he content and allow us to use the color separation of the cmd sequences ( ms and rgb ) to estimate their average helium difference .",
    "in particular , as shown by sbordone et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , filters redder than f435w are marginally affected by differences in c n o abundances , while they are sensitive to the helium content of the two mss .",
    "once we have selected the members of the two populations using the uv color - color diagrams , the optical photometry allows us to estimate the he content .",
