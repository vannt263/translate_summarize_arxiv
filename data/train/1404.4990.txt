    "over 900 extrasolar planets have been discovered so far ; a large fraction of them are close  in giant planets ( `` hot jupiters '' or hjs ) which account for more than 20 percent of all exoplanets .",
    "because hjs are considered to be gaseous planets , they are formed in protoplanetary disks during their formation era , which may affect the subsequent formation of terrestrial planets .",
    "for the origin of hjs , there are two commonly  invoked models that include type ii migration ( e.g. , @xcite ) and tidal circularization of high  eccentricity planets ( e.g. , @xcite ) based on the standard scenario of planet formation . in addition , we introduce a hybrid scenario of planet formation @xcite , in which giant planets that formed through gravitational instability can survive until the accretion phase of terrestrial planets .",
    "recent resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the formation of protostars and protoplanetary disks show the formation of multiple planetary ",
    "mass objects in the massive circumstellar disks in their formation stages ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "those objects tend to migrate inward rapidly in the early evolutionary phase of disks ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "to determine the fates of the objects , realistic numerical simulations of long  term evolution of those systems are required , but still remains computationally infeasible ( see , however , @xcite for their efforts on 2d simulations without magnetic field ) . on the other hand , recent observations of protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) and theoretical work on the disk accretion ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) indicate that an inner cavity tends to be created in a relatively early phase of disk accretion stage , which eventually stops the planetary migration in the inner region of the disk .",
    "therefore we can envision that some of gaseous planetary  mass objects formed through the gravitational fragmentation of massive disks undergo halfway migration to the inner regions and remain as hjs .",
    "this model provides a possible origin of the hj , in addition to the commonly  invoked models .",
    "giant planets , such as hjs , gravitationally influence the formation of terrestrial planets in several ways . to date",
    ", the formation of terrestrial planets in the presence of giant planets has been studied from several perspectives ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for example",

    "n_body simulations to investigate the formation of habitable planets during and after giant planet migration and found that water  rich planets can survive outside the orbit of giant planets .",
    "giant planets can open up a ring  like gap in a protoplanetary disk ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , outside of which a radial pressure maximum is created . @xcite",
    "demonstrated with sph simulations that the inward migration of meter ",
    "sized solid bodies is efficiently halted at the pressure maximum , which may trigger gravitational collapse ( see also @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "conducted numerical simulations that include collisional fragmentation of solid bodies developed by @xcite and found that fragments produced from planetesimals are accumulated at the edge of a jovian  opened density gap , leading to the rapid formation of saturn s core .",
    "n_body investigations have also been carried out .",
    "@xcite considered the case in which a giant planet is located at about 5 au and several planetary cores placed outside its orbit undergo type i inward migration .",
    "they observed that such planetary cores cease their migration by being captured into mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) with the giant planet .",
    "several bodies are in 3:2 or 2:1 mmrs at the end of simulation , thus many bodies are in 1:1 commensurabilities with each other .",
    "planetary cores are not lost via collision with the central star , which may act to enhance the growth of planets outside the orbit of the giant planet .",
    "type i migration can also be halted if the planet is in a region of positive surface density gradient where the coorbital corotation torque acts as a planet trap @xcite , which is neglected by @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the orbital evolution of several solid planets that undergo type i migration toward the outer edge of the density gap and confirmed that the planets can survive at the planet trap .",
    "@xcite performed _",
    "n_body investigations of protoplanets ( @xmath0=1030 ) in the presence of jupiter and saturn to examine the possibility of the accretion of uranus and neptune outside the gap opened by the giant planets .",

    "n_body simulations of the accretion of close  in terrestrial planets in the presence of an hj . in this study",

    "n_body simulation is combined with a semianalytical calculation of planet formation in order to consider the migration of protoplanets from distant regions .",
    "furthermore , we use several parameters that indicate uncertainties in the planet formation model ( e.g. , disk profile , type i migration rate ) and vary them over wide ranges to discuss the dependences of the results on the parameters .",
    "we especially focus on the close  in region , and thus our results are suitable for comparison with observational data of exoplanets .",
    "recent observations have discovered multiple planetary systems in such regions , and several basic properties have been revealed .",
    "for example , there is a lack of companion planets near the orbit of hjs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter oik13 ) investigated the formation of terrestrial planets outside the orbit of hjs assuming a relatively high  viscosity disk and found that the orbit of the hj moves inward by being pushed by terrestrial planets that are captured in a 2:1 mmr with the hj , which is called `` crowding  out . '' through this mechanism , we proposed a possible origin for the lack of additional planets in hj systems . in this paper",

    "then , all planets in the resonant chain interact with the hj , leading to inward migration of the hj .",
    "this induced migration of the hj is called `` crowding  out '' by smaller planets .",

    "the efficiency of crowding  out depends on the solid surface density in the disk ; when @xmath83 is small , the hj does not undergo induced migration .",

    "note that in the results for @xmath145 ( run ec13 ) , crowding  out is also not observed ( see figure  [ fig : t_a_vis](b ) ) .",
    "this is because the innermost planet in the resonant chain , which is located at the gap edge and does not yield a strong negative torque , has a large mass , and the total negative type i torque , which is suffered by other planets in the resonant chain , is too small to push the hj inward efficiently .",
    "( in other words , the factor @xmath194 in oik13 is small . )",
    "this mechanism of induced migration of hjs depends on the detailed structure of the gap edge and should be investigated further .",
    "here , we investigate angular momentum transfer in the system . figure  [ fig : a_t](a ) shows torques experienced by planets ( the hj and the innermost four planets ) for run ba1 at @xmath195 .",
    "black bars indicate the total torque exerted on the planets , while the other bars represent the mutual torque ( sum of gravitational torques from terrestrial planets ) , the damping torque ( @xmath39damping torque ) , the migration torque ( type i migration torque ) , and the hj torque ( sum of gravitational torque from the hj and contributions from indirect terms ) .",
    "the torques are normalized by @xmath196 for @xmath197 and @xmath198 . each value",
    "is averaged over 1 myr .",
    "the orbits of the planets in this system are almost steady at this moment , thus the torques on each body are equilibrated .    the sign of the type i migration torque depends on the slope of the surface density profile ; for run ba1 at @xmath199 , the fourth innermost solid planet at @xmath200 loses angular momentum , while the innermost three planets gain it from the type i migration torque . for the innermost planet , the magnitude of the positive type i torque is larger than that of the negative @xmath39damping torque , thus the excess angular momentum is transferred to the outer planets through resonant interactions between planets . as for the second innermost planet ,",
    "the positive type i torque almost balances the negative @xmath39-damping torque so that there is only a small net mutual torque exerted on the planet .",
    "the transferred positive torque from the innermost planet is predominantly consumed by the third and fourth planets .",
    "we see that the angular momentum transferred from / to the hj is negligible .",
    "@xcite have found that when a planet with nonzero eccentricity resides near the inner edge of a disk , the planet gains angular momentum from the disk owing to drag forces , @xmath34 , that are attributed to the velocity difference between the planet and the disk gas .",
    "the positive torque exerted on the planet in the edge is called edge torque .",
    "the magnitude of the edge torque depends on the gas density difference between the pericenter and apocenter , in other words the eccentricity of the planet and the sharpness of the edge , and the strength of the drag force . in our model , the @xmath39damping force acts as edge torque because it contains the term corresponding to the difference between the orbital velocity of the planet and the gas velocity .",
    "we see in figure  [ fig : a_t](a ) that no edge torque operates on planets .",
    "this is because the eccentricity of the innermost planet is relatively small ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "on the other hand , figure  [ fig : a_t](b ) shows the torques on planets at @xmath202 for run bb1 , for which @xmath157 is assumed .",
    "we find that the innermost planet at @xmath203 is subject to a positive @xmath39damping torque , which is the edge torque .",
    "the eccentricity of the innermost planet is slightly excited to @xmath204 .",
    "figure  [ fig : a_t](c ) shows the torques on planets for run ea1 at @xmath205 , where the inward migration of the hj , `` crowding  out '' , is observed .",
    "the force acting on the hj is primarily the gravitational force from the innermost planet , which is captured in a 2:1 resonance with the hj .",
    "this indicates a transfer of angular momentum from the hj to the planets in the resonant chain .",
    "we find that the eccentricity damping force gives a contribution to the change of the semimajor axis . from @xmath34",
    ", we can calculate @xmath206 averaged over an orbit as @xmath207 where @xmath208 .",
    "if the eccentricity is small enough , this migration rate is negligible .",
    "however , eccentricities are pumped up by mutual interactions between planets , resulting in planetary migration caused by @xmath34 .    in the above discussion",
    ", we assume that planets follow a keplerian orbit , however they can be changed by the gravitational influence of the hj . in many runs of the simulation",
    ", we observe that the orbital velocity near the apocenter is not so slow that the positive tailwind torque near the apocenter can not compensate for the negative headwind torque near the pericenter , resulting in a net negative torque ( inward migration ) .",
    "this arises because the orbital velocity of the planet is altered by the gravity of the hj .",
    "this phenomenon has several characteristics .",
    "when the perturber resides inside the orbit of the planet , the velocity of the planet is increased leading to a loss of angular momentum via gas drag . on the other hand ,",
    "if the perturber lies outside the orbit of the planet , the orbital velocity of the planet is decreased and the planet gains angular momentum , resulting in a net outward migration .",
    "the magnitude of the change in the orbital velocity depends both on the mass of the perturber and its distance from the planet .",
    "a more detailed study of this phenomenon should be done in future work .",
    "we discuss several of the final properties of planetary systems and their dependence on parameters .",
    "the typical masses of the largest planets and the total mass in planets are @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively , and depend little on @xmath65 but strongly on @xmath83 .",
    "the mass ratio between the largest planet and the total mass is typically @xmath211 , whereas the value decreases down to @xmath212 for @xmath176 .    in oik13 , we derived the total mass in the resonant chain , @xmath213 , ( see section  4 in oik13 ) where @xmath213 is the total mass of planets that migrate to the vicinity of the gap edge before gas depletion .",
    "thus , @xmath213 is comparable to @xmath185 and also correlates with @xmath184 .",
    "according to oik13 , @xmath213 can be expressed in two different ways depending on the values of parameters . as stated in section  [ sec : results1 ] and oik13 , the mass of migrating planets is given by the critical mass for migration or the isolation mass , whichever is smaller .",
    "the condition where the mass of all the migrating planets is expressed by the isolation mass is @xmath214 when @xmath83 , @xmath4 , and @xmath65 are small , this inequality is satisfied . in that case",
    ", the total mass in the resonant chain is @xmath215 in the other case , where the mass of the migrating bodies is expressed by the critical mass , the total mass is given by @xmath216 the final masses can be roughly estimated using equations  ( [ eq : m_chain_iso ] ) and ( [ eq : m_chain_crit ] ) . note that in most simulations in this study , @xmath213 is expressed using equation  ( [ eq : m_chain_crit ] ) .",
    "we find from this equation that the mass is weakly dependent on @xmath65 and is roughly linearly dependent on @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath213 can be regarded as @xmath185 ; for example , the total mass in planets is @xmath217 for runs ba15 and @xmath170 for runs be15 , consistent with the estimate of equation  ( [ eq : m_chain_crit ] ) .",
    "the typical mass ratio of @xmath218 means that one large planet dominates the mass in planets .",
    "migrating protoplanets formed via oligarchic growth have comparable masses , but are blocked at the traps ( e.g. , gap edge ) and collide with one another , resulting in mass accumulation near the traps .",
    "thus , one can argue that the gap and the 2:1 resonance act as traps that concentrate solid materials in one planet . during this process",
    ", orbital rearrangements of the resonant chain caused by planets that migrate from the outer region induce collisions between planets , which increases the fraction of @xmath184 . in other words ,",
    "when the migration is less effective and orbital rearrangement hardly occurs , @xmath160 can also be kept small .",
    "for example , in the results for @xmath176 , the @xmath24damping rate ( type i migration and @xmath39damping ) is small , which results in smaller values of @xmath179 .      at the gap edge",
    ", planets no longer migrate and capture other planets migrating from the outer disks into resonances .",
    "the typical values of resonant commensurabilities are between 4:3 and 9:8 , and have little dependence on the parameters . the condition for capture into first - order mmrs among two bodies",
    "is derived by @xcite .",
    "the critical migration timescale for capture into a @xmath219 resonance , where @xmath220 is an integer , is @xmath221 where the values of the numerical coefficients are @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , and @xmath225 between small and large planets .",
    "note that for resonance capture between planets with comparable masses , the coefficients are changed ( see table  2 of @xcite ) . if the relative migration timescale between two bodies is between the critical migration timescales @xmath226 and @xmath227 , capture into a @xmath219 resonance is assured unless the eccentricity at the resonant encounter is not sufficiently high @xmath228 .",
    "although planets in this study are captured in multiple mmrs , we can roughly discuss the origins of resonant configurations with the use of @xmath229 for two  body resonances .    for runs ba15 at @xmath230 ,",
    "the mass of the body migrating from the outer region is @xmath167 and its migration timescale is @xmath231 .",
    "the maximum planetary mass in the resonant chain is @xmath232 , thus the mass ratio between the migrating body and the largest planet is @xmath212 . from equation  ( [ eq : ta_crit ] )",
    ", the planet is expected to be captured in a 3:2 or 4:3 resonance . indeed , several planets are captured in 4:3 resonances , while some other pairs are captured in high @xmath220 resonances due to gravitational pushing by other planets .",
    "we can discuss resonant capture by comparing @xmath96 and @xmath227 .",
    "when @xmath65 is altered between 0.1 and 10 , both the mass of the largest planet and the migration timescale are not changed significantly , as described in section  [ sec : mass ] , thus @xmath233 , which is almost independent of @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , the resonant configuration is insensitive to @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , we can discuss the dependence on @xmath83 .",
    "for the case of @xmath162 , the migration timescale of migrating bodies is @xmath234 , and the mass of the largest planet is @xmath235 , therefore @xmath236 .",
    "because this value is slightly larger than that for the fiducial model , the resonant configuration is in a slightly separated resonance , such as 3:2 ( see table  [ tbl : results ] for runs be15 ) .",
    "for the case of @xmath237 , both @xmath53 and @xmath229 are increased by a factor of @xmath238 , and therefore the resonant commensurabilities are almost the same as those for the case of @xmath239 .    in short , resonant configurations can be discussed with use of @xmath229 .",
    "the migration timescale is basically shorter than @xmath240 ( the critical migration timescale for a 2:1 resonance ) , which means that closely spaced resonances ( e.g. , 5:4 ) are favored .",

    "note that as observed in the results of long  term calculations ( e.g. , run ba1 ) , resonant configurations can be lost during the long  term evolution ; although the formation of resonances is a robust process , they do not necessarily remain until the end .    in the above discussion , the condition for capture into two  body mmrs is used , however , the use of this formula is not strictly appropriate when one considers capture into multiple mmrs .",
    "this is an issue that we will address in a future publication .      as for the orbital separations between planets ,",
    "the smallest separation for each run is typically below 10 hill radii .",
    "according to an investigation of orbital stability of non  resonant multiple planet systems @xcite , such systems with relatively small separations should become unstable within a timescale of @xmath242 .",
    "however , we find that most systems are stable after @xmath243 : this is because the orbital crossing time of planets in a resonant chain can become significantly longer than that of non  resonant planets @xcite .",
    "observations have suggested that there is a lack of companion planets in hj systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in oik13 , we performed _",
    "n_body simulations of planet formation assuming @xmath29 and found that several terrestrial planets efficiently form outside the orbit of an hj .",
    "they gravitationally interact with the hj through resonances , which leads to the inward migration of the hj ( crowding  out ) .",
    "we proposed that our model naturally explains the lack of additional observed planets in orbits close to hjs regardless of the disk mass .",
    "when planet formation occurs in a less massive disk , crowding  out is not effective and the hj and terrestrial planets can coexist .",
    "however , the companion planets tend to remain small and below the detection limit of current observations .    for @xmath28",
    ", we find that several terrestrial planets are robustly formed outside the orbit of an hj and captured in a resonant chain , and they hardly interact with the hj . as a result ,",
    "both the terrestrial planets and hj coexist at the end .",
    "in addition , @xmath160 is high @xmath244 , thus a few large terrestrial planets tend to form .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that terrestrial planets could be observed in orbits close to hjs by current surveys , and that future observations may detect these systems .",
    "however , because observational data obtained so far clearly indicate the lack of companion planets in hj systems , it suggests that turbulent viscosity is larger than the value adopted @xmath193 because the region in the vicinity of the central star is considered to be mri active .",
    "it is also possible that terrestrial planets pass through the gap edge .",
    "although we found that planetary systems that consist of only terrestrial planets can be reproduced by crowding  out of hjs , it is worth mentioning that the crowding  out has not necessarily been experienced by such systems . according to _ n_body simulations in which formation of the terrestrial planets is investigated without considering hjs , multiple close  in terrestrial planets form captured in mmrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that multiple terrestrial planets that are not locked in mmrs form if the type i migration speed is reduced by a factor of 100 from that predicted by the linear theory @xcite . to examine various models ,",
    "it is important to compare predictions from formation models with observational data statistically ; however , we leave this for subsequent work .",

    "the typical duration of this stage is @xmath245 .",
    "migration stage : the protoplanets undergo inward migration with the migration timescale @xmath96 , which is determined by the embryo mass and several parameters ( e.g. , @xmath4 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "the innermost body ceases its migration when it is trapped by the gap edge or captured in a 2:1 mmr with the hj , whichever happens first . during this stage , embryos that formed in the outer region sequentially",
    "migrate inward before the depletion of the gas disk .",
    "they are captured in mmrs with inner planets that reside in a chain of resonant planets or undergo close encounters with the inner bodies leading to a rearrangement of orbital configurations .",
    "the innermost planet tends to be the largest body , which consists of about 50 percent of the total mass of the close  in planets .",
    "when the resonant chain is captured in a 2:1 resonance with the hj , the hj can be pushed inward to the vicinity of the central star , the migration speed of which depends on the conditions .",
    "this stage continues until the gas has almost decayed @xmath246 .",
    "final stage : after the gas depletion , final orbital configurations are established . in some cases , as the effect of eccentricity  damping weakens , planets exhibit local orbital crossings resulting in giant impacts . even after local orbital instability ,",
    "several commensurabilities tend to remain , although in some cases all resonant relations are lost via collisions .",
    "mass : : :    the typical mass of the largest planet is    @xmath247",
    ". the mass ratio of the largest    planet and the total mass in planets is large    @xmath248 .",
    "owing to the stalling of migration ,    solid bodies are accreted by one or a few planets , and eventually a    large difference in mass between the largest planet and small planets    is created .",
    "the mass also hardly depends on @xmath65 .",
    "an increase / decrease in @xmath83 results in an    increase / decrease of the embryo growth rate and mass .",
    "mmr : : :    we find that the formation of chains of resonant planets is robust if    both migration and trapping by the edge or the 2:1 resonance with the    hj are effective .",
    "the typical commensurability in the resonant chain    is between the 4:3 resonance and the 9:8 resonance , which also weakly    depends on the input parameters ( e.g. , @xmath65 and    @xmath83 ) .",
    "we also observe a tendency that orbital    crossings after gas dissipation occur more frequently in the case of    large @xmath83 .",
    "almost no planets formed are captured    in 1:1 coorbital resonances .    through a series of simulations , our understanding of the reason for the lack of companion planets in hj systems is improved .",
    "if @xmath28 is assumed , it is difficult to explain the observations .",
    "therefore , this may suggest that the disk viscosity near the hj is high @xmath249 and the crowding  out of the hj by terrestrial planets is effective .",
    "this study provides several suggestions for future study .",
    "one is the fact that the results for the final orbital configuration are almost identical for small@xmath0 and large@xmath0 simulations .",
    "thus , for the purpose of examining the configuration of final states , _",
    "n_body simulations can be started with relatively large protoplanets .",
    "in addition , we show capability of numerical simulations that combine an _ n_body code with a semi  analytic population synthesis model",
    ". we also find the orbital velocity of planets that are located near the hj to be altered , resulting in the transport of angular momentum through gas drag .",
    "this should be investigated in detail using high  resolution dynamical simulations in which the gas motion is also calculated by a magneto  hydrodynamical code .",
    "this study can be applied to the formation of planets outside warm / cool jupiters , which may solve several issues regarding the formation of gaseous / icy planets in the solar system . as stated in sections  [ sec : intro ] and",
    "[ sec : model ] , it is of particular importance to resolve the gas flow around hjs and to examine the structure and evolution of the inner disk , which should be investigated in future studies .",

    "<S> the formed planets are not equal  mass ; the largest planet constitutes more than 50 percent of the total mass in the close  in region , which is also less dependent on parameters . in the previous work of this paper @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we have found a new physical mechanism of induced migration of the hot jupiter , which is called a crowding  out . </S>",
    "<S> if the hot jupiter opens up a wide gap in the disk ( e.g. , owing to low disk viscosity ) , crowding  out becomes less efficient and the hot jupiter remains . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss angular momentum transfer between the planets and disk . </S>"
