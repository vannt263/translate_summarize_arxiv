    "shear flow has profound effects on complex fluids .",
    "it can perturb equilibrium phase transitions , such as the isotropic - to - nematic ( i - n ) liquid crystalline transition in wormlike micelles @xcite , thermotropic melts @xcite , or rigid - rod suspensions @xcite ; the nematic - smectic transition in thermotropic liquid crystals @xcite ; and the isotropic - to - lamellar transition @xcite in surfactant systems .",
    "shear can also induce structures , such as the well - known multi - lamellar vesicles ( onions ) in surfactant systems @xcite , that exist only as metastable equilibrium phases .",
    "another well - known effect is the transition between orientations of diblock copolymer lamellae in either the steady shear flow @xcite , or the oscillatory shear flow @xcite , as a function of shear rate or frequency , and temperature .",
    "20.5pc = 3.5truein    a related phenomenon is dynamic instability in non - newtonian fluids whose theoretical _ homogeneous _ stress  strain - rate constitutive relations exhibit multi - valued behavior , as in theories of polymer melts @xcite and wormlike micelles @xcite .",
    "such models may describe , for example , the spurt effect , whereby the flow rate of a fluid in a pipe changes discontinuously as a function of applied pressure drop @xcite . a non - monotonic constitutive curve as in fig .",
    "[ fig : both ] typically has a segment ( shown as a broken line ) where bulk flow is unstable . if a mean strain rate is imposed which forces the system to lie on an unstable part of the constitutive relation , a natural resolution for this instability is to break the system into two regions , often called _ bands _ , one on the high strain rate branch and one on the low strain rate branch , to maintain the overall applied strain rate .",
    "the most important unresolved question about these banded flows is , what determines the stress at which the system phase separates into bands ?",
    "experiments on many systems ( reviewed in sec .",
    "iia ) , particularly the wormlike micelle surfactant systems , reveal that there is a well - defined and reproducible selected stress in a wide class of systems    there have been many suggestions for determining the selected stress .",
    "some workers have assumed the existence of a non - equilibrium potential and a variational principle @xcite .",
    "this possibility is intriguing , although it remains unproven .",
    "early studies postulated a jump at the top of the stable viscous branch ( `` top jumping '' ) @xcite , but experiments have shown that this is not the case @xcite .",
    "recent studies have solved the homogeneous flow equations in various geometries using sophisticated hydrodynamic flow - solvers and found a selected stress @xcite .",
    "however , evidence is growing @xcite that these calculations have history - dependent stress selection ( which is in fact no selection ) or introduce gradient terms due to the discretization of the system .",
    "a final method , which we follow here , has been to incorporate ( physically present ) non - local contributions to the stress @xcite , and examine the equations of motion under steady banded flow conditions .",
    "here we extend previous work @xcite and calculate phase diagrams for rigid - rod suspensions in shear flow , solving for the interfacial profile between phases and using its properties to determine the coexistence stress . as fig .",
    "[ fig : both ] indicates , phase separation is possible at _ either _ a specified stress ( horizontal tie lines ) _ or _ a specified strain rate ( vertical tie lines ) .",
    "only recently has the latter possibility been speculated upon @xcite , and found experimentally @xcite .",
    "we explore this possibility explicitly for our model system , which possesses , in addition to the high and low strain rate ( paranematic and nematic , respectively ) branches shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : both ] , a second high strain rate branch in which the rods stand up in the flow , parallel to the vorticity direction , instead of lying in the shear plane @xcite .",
    "we study coexistence with this so - called ` log - rolling ' phase and find a rich non - equilibrium phase diagram .",
    "the summary of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the general issues of shear banding and phase separation in flow , and summarize the primary experimental evidence for this behavior . in section",
    "iii we present the modified doi model @xcite and in section  iv we briefly discuss our algorithm for calculating the phase diagram .",
    "the general aspects of the interface construction will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we present the results for common stress and strain rate phase separation in section  v and  vi , respectively , and discuss some of the implications for metastability and experiments under controlled stress or controlled strain rate conditions .",
    "we finish in section  vii with a discussion and summary .",
    "while some of these results have been briefly summarized elsewhere @xcite , the current paper is a complete and self - contained discussion of the problem .",
    "the reader interested in the phenomenology of phase diagrams for sheared complex fluids rather than liquid crystals may safely skip section  iii ; the rest of the paper is general , and much of the discussion applies to any system undergoing phase separation in shear flow .",
    "there are , essentially , two steps to calculating phase behavior in flow .",
    "one must derive the dynamical equations of motion for fluid flow , composition , and the relevant structural order parameter(s ) , which is quite difficult .",
    "then , one must understand how to solve them and interpret the results .",
    "while the modified doi model does not exhaust all possible phase diagrams ( in particular , a shear - thickening model would be a nice complement ) , it has many universal features .",
    "one extremely important concept is that density and field variables are ill - defined in non - equilibrium systems : _ either _ stress _ or _ strain rate may act as a control parameter analogous to an equilibrium field variable ( _ e.g. _ pressure , chemical potential ) , corresponding to the different orientations of the interface between coexisting phases .",
    "also , one can gain much intuition from the underlying stress ",
    "strain - rate ",
    "composition _ surface _",
    ", a fact which we feel has been underappreciated until now .",
    "shear banding has been confirmed in many systems through direct optical and nmr visualization , and deduced from rheological measurements .",
    "the best - studied systems are surfactant solutions of various kinds , including wormlike micelles and onion - lamellar phases .",
    "rehage and hoffmann @xcite measured a plateau in the stress ",
    "strain - rate relation for wormlike micelles in shear flow .",
    "this behavior has since been seen in a number of wormlike micellar systems in various flow geometries , by the montpellier @xcite , strasbourg @xcite , edinburgh @xcite , and massey groups @xcite .",
    "@xcite visualized shear bands in the plateau region of the stress ",
    "strain - rate curves using optical techniques , providing proof of banding ; and callaghan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used nmr to measure the velocity profile in various geometries ( including couette , cone - and - plate , and pipe geometries ) .",
    "the transition in these cases is to a strongly - aligned , possibly nematic , phase of wormlike micelles which has a lower viscosity than the quiescent phase .",
    "it is not known how the length distribution changes in flow , although this is certainly an important aspect of these ` living ' systems @xcite .",
    "wormlike micellar system can possess an equilibrium nematic phase , and in some cases the shear - induced phase is obviously influenced by the proximity of an underlying nematic phase transition @xcite .",
    "however , many wormlike micellar systems undergo banding at compositions much more dilute than that for i - n coexistence , and it is probable that in these cases flow instability is due to the non - linear rheology of these systems , which is in many respects similar to that of the doi - edwards model of polymer melts @xcite . since there are at lease two possible effects ( a nematic phase transition and flow - instability of the micellar constitutive relation ) apparently leading to flow - instability , these systems are quite rich .",
    "it is tempting to analyze the extent to which these systems display behavior analogous to the kinetics of equilibrium phase separation , and groups have recently begun to study the kinetics of non - equilibrium phase separation @xcite .",
    "pine and co - workers have recently studied a wormlike surfactant system at extreme dilutions and found , surprisingly , that for low enough concentrations ( but still above the overlap concentration ) shear induces a viscoelastic phase that they interpret as a gel @xcite .",
    "the origins and structure of this gel are currently unknown . in controlled stress experiments they observe shear banding and",
    "a ` plateau ' for stresses higher than a certain stress , in which the strain rate _ decreases _ as shear induces the gel .",
    "above the stress at which the gel fills the sample cell the strain rate increases again to complete a dramatic curve .",
    "for controlled strain rate experiments the system jumps , at a well defined strain rate , between the gel and solution phases .",
    "another well - studied system is the onion lamellar surfactant phase , originally studied by roux , diat , and nallet @xcite .",
    "these systems display a bewildering variety of transitions between lamellar , aligned - lamellar , onion , and onion crystal phases of various symmetries , as functions of applied shear flow , temperature , and composition . as an example , one particular system undergoes transitions , with increasing strain rate , from disordered lamellae to onion , to onion - lamellae coexistence ( in which coexistence is inferred from a plateau in the stress ",
    "strain - rate curves ) , to well - ordered lamellae @xcite .",
    "recently bonn and co - workers @xcite found shear - induced transitions between different gel states of lamellar onion solutions with shear bands ( visualized by inserting tracer particles ) oriented with interface normals in the vorticity direction , indicating phase separation at common strain rate instead of common stress , as we clarify below . in this case the averaged stress ",
    "strain - rate constitutive relation followed a sideways curve under controlled strain rate conditions .",
    "_ @xcite have recently studied a thermotropic polymer liquid crystal using visual and rheological measurements , and inferred a shear - induced nematic phase transition and phase separation , the latter which they attribute to polydispersity .    in summary , shear - banding has been seen in several systems , and in all cases is associated with some flow - induced change in the fluid microstructure .",
    "most systems are still poorly - understood @xcite and , given the range of complexity , it is certain that many qualitatively new phenomena remain to be discovered .",
    "the crux of the problem from a theoretical point of view may be appreciated from fig .",
    "[ fig : both ] .",
    "these stress  strain - rate curves are somewhat reminiscent of pressure - density ( @xmath0 ) isotherms for a liquid - gas system .",
    "curve segments with negative slope , @xmath1 , are unstable and can not describe a physical state of a bulk homogeneous system .",
    "analogously , isotherms with negative slopes @xmath2 have negative bulk moduli and are unstable .",
    "the liquid - gas system resolves this instability by phase - separating into regions of different densities ( according to the lever rule to maintain the average density ) .",
    "similarly , the banded flows seen in the experiments described above appear to be a non - equilibrium phase separation into regions of high and low strain - rate , maintaining the applied mean strain rate .    in previous work @xcite we constructed a ` phase diagram ' by pursuing an analogy between homogeneous stable steady states and equilibrium phases .",
    "as in equilibrium , non - equilibrium ` phases ' may be separated , in field variable space , by hyper - surfaces representing continuous ( _ e.g. _ critical points / lines ) or discontinuous ( ` first - order ' ) transitions .",
    "coexistence implies an inhomogeneous state spanning separate branches of the homogeneous flow curves .",
    "note , however , that there is an ambiguity in connecting separate branches of the homogeneous flow curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : both ] .",
    "the top curve permits coexistence of states with the same stress and different strain rates , while the lower curve also allows coexistence of states with the same strain rate and different stresses @xcite !    fig .",
    "[ fig : couette ] shows that phase separation at a common stress occurs such that the interface between bands is parallel to the vorticity - velocity plane ( annular bands , in couette flow ) , while phase separation at a common strain rate occurs with the interface between bands parallel to the velocity  velocity - gradient plane ( stacked discs , in couette flow ) .",
    "20.5pc = 3.0truein    this highlights a striking contrast between equilibrium and non - equilibrium systems . in equilibrium",
    "the field variables ( pressure , temperature , chemical potential ) are uniquely defined and determine phase coexistence . in sheared fluids",
    ", one needs an extra field variable to determine the extended phase diagram .",
    "however , _ for a system with more than one choice of coexisting geometry , the appropriate field variable may not necessarily be identified a priori_. the complete answer of how to determine ( theoretically ) the dynamic field variable is not known .",
    "of course the nature of the constitutive relation may help , for example the top curve of the fig .",
    "[ fig : both ] does not allow the strain rate as the field variable .",
    "we will come back to discuss some possible answers to this interesting problem in subsection [ which ] ( see also @xcite for other suggestions ) .",
    "another important difference from equilibrium systems is evident when , say assuming the system choose to form shear bands at common stress , we try to determine at which stress a system shear bands .",
    "the constitutive relations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : both ] are calculated for homogeneous states , and there is no apparent prescription for determining the selected banding stress , despite the experimental evidence for a selected stress .",
    "a similar apparent degeneracy occurs in first order phase transitions in equilibrium statistical mechanics , but is easily resolved by demanding that the system minimize its total free energy , or , equivalently , by appealing to the convexity of the free energy of the equilibrium thermodynamic systems @xcite .",
    "this leads to equality of field variables between two phases and the common tangent condition ( _ e.g. _ the maxwell equal areas construction for liquid - gas coexistence @xcite , or the equal osmotic pressure condition , aided by equal chemical potential , in rod suspensions @xcite ) .    in the shear band problem ,",
    "an unambiguous resolution of this degeneracy is to consider the full _ inhomogeneous _ ( _ i.e. _ non - local in space ) equations of motion , and determine phase coexistence by that choice of field variables ( appropriately chosen by hand ) for which there exists a _",
    "stationary _ interfacial solution to the steady - state differential equations of motion @xcite . for zero stress",
    "this technique reduces , as it should , to minimization of the free energy .",
    "the importance of inhomogeneous terms in fluid equations of motion has been noted by several groups , who pointed out that the standard fluid equations can have ill - defined mathematical solutions @xcite if such terms are not included . of course",
    ", if the phase diagram depends sensitively on the form or magnitude of the inhomogeneous terms one need a detail understanding of the underlying physics .",
    "the use of a stable interface to select among possible coexisting states was first postulated for non - linear dynamical systems , as far as we know , by kramer @xcite , and later by pomeau @xcite ; and first applied ( independently ) to complex fluids in ref .",
    "the inclusion of gradient terms in constitutive relations is rapidly gaining acceptance , as recent preprints by goveas ( phase separation of model blends of long and short polymers ) @xcite and dhont ( introduction of model gradient terms to resolve stress selection ) @xcite indicate .    in this work",
    "we study a model for rigid - rod suspensions in shear flow . while there are certainly ongoing experiments on these systems @xcite , the primary motivation for this extended work is to explore the manner in which phase separation and coexistence occurs in complex fluids in flow .",
    "the approximations used in obtaining our equations are severe ( including a decoupling approximation whose defects are well - known @xcite ) , and we expect qualitative agreement at best .",
    "however , this is the first complete study of which we are aware of non - equilibrium phase separation of a complex fluid in flow for a concrete model , and we hope it illuminates the phenomenology of flow - induced phase transitions .",
    "we seek the equations of motion for a solution of rod - like particles .",
    "the most useful dynamic variables describing the long - wavelength hydrodynamic degrees of freedom are the volume fraction @xmath3 , the fluid velocity @xmath4 , and the nematic order parameter tensor @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the rod orientations , @xmath7 denotes an average around the point @xmath8 .",
    "previous studies of liquid crystals under shear flow have been either for thermotropics @xcite , where the issues we present below associated with composition coupling are not present ; or homogeneous suspensions @xcite , where phase coexisting was not considered .",

    "20.5pc = 3.5truein    we can not rule out the possibility that changes in @xmath174 shift the phase boundaries by small amounts below our accuracy , which is of order 0.1% in @xmath29 , but the apparent independence of the phase boundaries on @xmath174 is curious .",
    "one might be tempted to generalize and suggest that , for finite @xmath174 , there exists a selection criterion which involves only the homogeneous equations of motion , rather than requiring the inhomogenous terms as in the interface construction .",
    "an interface construction may also be used to determine equilibrium phase boundaries , in which case a stationary interface is equivalent to minimizing a free energy and the ( relaxational ) dynamical equations derived from a variational principle @xcite . in the case of a van der waals fluid this reproduces the maxwell construction .",
    "a steady state equation for a single variable @xmath175 with homogeneous and inhomogeneous terms of the form @xmath176 can be integrated to yield a solvability condition for @xmath96 , which is equivalent to the stable interface method . in equilibrium",

    "this is because of the terms @xmath179 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : convect ] ) and @xmath180 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) . in extensional flow",
    "@xmath50 is symmetric , so that @xmath179 integrates to @xmath181 , while in shear flow this term can only be integrated by introducing an integral representation @xcite .",
    "hence a first integral of the steady state equations can not be found in shear flow , and it seems unlikely that a general condition involving only the homogeneous portion of the steady state equations can determine coexistence . while we appear to find , for this set of gradient terms , solvability conditions that are independent of @xmath174 for @xmath182 , the relationship of this to a variational principle remains unknown .",
    "we have not exhausted the possible gradient terms .",
    "for example , higher order gradients in the free energy ( @xmath183 , _ etc .",
    "_ ) would yield higher - order differential equations for the interfacial profile , and other square gradient terms such as @xmath184 are possible @xcite .",
    "hence , we believe that , for finite @xmath174 , _ the apparent independence of our results on gradient terms only applies to the particular ( simple ) family of gradient terms we have chosen_. the structure of the differential equations describing the steady states may change abruptly for @xmath173 , for which a term is lost in the differential equations , leading to a distinctly different selection criteria and the shifted phase boundary in fig .  [ fig : acc ] . unfortunately , this particular set of equations is too complex for this kind of analysis .",
    "for example , in a study of a simpler constitutive model , one can demonstrate that the selected stress depends on the detail form of the gradient terms @xcite .",
    "several workers have claimed to find an equal areas construction on the stress ",
    "strain - rate constitutive curve @xcite .",
    "that is , the `` plateau '' as the system traverses the two - phase region is said to describe a path such that the areas above and below the plateau , enclosed by the plateau line and the underlying constitutive curve , are the same .",
    "this is not true here , as can be seen in fig .",

    "having calculated _ both _ common strain rate and common stress phase separation for the same system , and noticing from figs .",
    "[ fig : tieboth ] and  [ fig : ties ] that there are compositions and shear conditions which lie inside the two - phase regions of all three calculated phase separations , we must address the question of which phase separation occurs .",
    "we have already argued that we expect phase - separation at common stress to be metastable with respect to phase separation at common stress . what about the relative stability of phase separation at either common stress or common strain rate ?    with limited one - dimensonal calculations for systems of different symmetry ( annular bands at common stress and",
    "stacked disk - like bands for common strain rate ) it is impossible to calculate the stability of one interface profile with respect to another .",
    "renardy calculated the stability of common stress coexistence to capillary fluctuations @xcite , which is a start ; and such a stability analysis has been performed , in part , on the layer orientation of smectic systems in flow @xcite .",
    "however , some insight can be obtained by examining the `` phase diagrams '' in the chemical potential ",
    "field variable ( either stress or strain rate ) planes .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu ] are analogous to lines of phase coexistence in , for example , the pressure  temperature plane in a simple fluid .",

    "the dashed line denotes the range of stresses at coexistence for common strain rate phase separation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mu]a ) , for which stress is a generalized density variable and strain rate the field variable .    fig .",
    "[ fig : mu]a indicates that , for a system undergoing at a common strain rate , the chemical potential and stress for the phase falls within the single phase region of the common _ stress _ phase diagram .",
    "hence , we expect this _",
    "i _ phase to be unstable ( or metastable ) with respect to phase separation at common stress .",
    "similarly , the control parameters ( chemical potential and stress ) for the phase coexisting at a common strain rate lie within the single phase region for common stress phase separation , which we also expect to be unstable ( or metastable ) .",
    "conversely , for a system coexisting at a common stress the phase lies within the single phase region of the common strain rate phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mu]b ) , and similarly for the phase .",
    "this suggests that phase separation at a common strain rate is unstable ( or metastable ) with respect to phase separation at common stress , while phase separation at a common stress is stable .",
    "20.5pc = 3.5truein    note that , ultimately , this selection of phase coexistence geometries follows from the transition being a shear - thinning transition ; for a shear thickening transition the situation could be reversed . in this case phase coexistence at a common strain rate and a given @xmath93 would imply a shear - induced phase ( analogous to the phase ) with a higher stress than the phase . if the phase coexistence line for common stress ( strain rate ) lay within a loop corresponding to the stresses ( strain rates ) for common strain rate ( stress ) coexistence , then common strain rate coexistence would be expected to be stable , by analogy with the isotropic - nematic shear thinning model .",
    "obviously this argument is delicate . in a fluid where only one phase coexistence ( either common stress or common strain rate )",
    "is supported by the dynamical equations this argument is moot .    =    2 an alternative possibility is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolve ] if one argues that in steady state , among the possible phases which are compatible with the interface solvability condition , the chemical potential reaches its absolute minimum .",
    "consider increasing the strain rate for a given mean concentration .",

    "[ fig : resolve]a - c denote the @xmath186 and @xmath187 paths for the homogeneous high and low shear rate states , in the two phase diagrams . in fig .",

    "[ fig : resolve]b the path is a - b - c - d , and in fig .",

    "this path ensures that the system maintains the minimum chemical potential for an imposed strain rate . upon increasing the strain rate from zero",
    "the system remains in the one phase region until a is reached , at which point phase separation at common stress occurs .",
    "note that a spans two points of coexistence in the @xmath188 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : resolve]a ) on the lines @xmath189 and @xmath190 . upon",
    "further increasing the strain rate the system continues to phase separate at common stress , following the segment a - b in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolve]b and the two ( coexisting ) segments a - b in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolve]a .",
    "the mean chemical potential and strain rate follow the diagonal segment a - b in fig .",

    ", the system can continue to maintain its lowest chemical potential by phase separating with a common strain rate in the two phases , _",
    "i.e. _ with shear bands in the vorticity direction .",
    "hence , the system next follows the path b-c in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolve]a ( @xmath188 plane ) and the two coexisting paths b-c in fig .",

    "this scenario follows from minimizing the chemical potential , and its correctness , of course , should be further examined by the full time evolution of the original dynamic equations .",
    "it is probable that boundary conditions also play a role .",
    "consider a couette device .",
    "typically the walls provide uniform boundary conditions in the azimuthal direction , while the slight inhomogeneity of couette flow induces an asymmetry between the inner and outer cylinders . the slightly higher stress near the inner wall provides a preference for the high strain rate nematic phase , and",
    "hence might enhance the stability of common stress phase separation .",
    "similarly , the intrinsic inhomogeneity ( although weaker ) in cone - and - plate rheometry induces a preference for the common stress interfacial configuration @xcite .",
    "we are also unable to say anything about the number or spacing of bands .",
    "analogies with equilibrium systems suggest that phase separation would coarsen until the system formed two bands at different strain rates ( for phase separation at a common stress ) .",
    "this is the behavior seen in visualizations of flow in couette , cone - and - plate , and pipe geometries , where the intrinsic inhomogeneity provides a `` seed '' for macroscopic phase separation @xcite .",
    "recent visualization of banding in lamellar surfactant systems @xcite indicate that phase separation at a common strain rate can exhibit bands ( disc - like bands in couette flow ) whose initial spacing depends on the applied strain rate and coarsen in time .",
    "unlike common stress bands , which are expected to ( and do ) form macroscopic bands in couette flow , there is no boundary effect in couette ( aside from perhaps sedimentation ) which would encourage common strain rate bands to coalesce readily .",
    "normal stresses may play a role in this process .      in calculating the phase diagrams we have calculated the stability of the fluid under conditions of either fixed strain rate or fixed stress .",
    "these limits of stability , analogous to spinodals in equilibrium systems , are displayed in figures  [ fig : tie ] and  [ fig : ties ] .",
    "note that the stability limits and critical points differ , depending on the control variable ( stress @xmath136 or strain rate @xmath95 ) . to see why this is , note",
    "that schematically the dynamical equations of motion have the form @xmath192 where @xmath193 comprises the dynamical variables ( order parameter @xmath35 and composition @xmath19 ) .",
    "the second equation relates the stress to strain rate and dynamical variables at steady state ( or in the zero reynolds number limit ) , which implies that the strain rate @xmath95 , for a given stress , is a function @xmath194 .",
    "consider fluctuations about a steady state @xmath195 : @xmath196 .",
    "the dynamics for the fluctuation obeys @xmath197    the limit of stability for common strain rate is calculated using the fluctuation matrix @xmath198 , while the limit of stability for common stress was calculated using @xmath199 .",
    "these correspond to different stability criteria .    the question of which spinodal could be observed in an experiment relies on the accuracy of prescribed stress and prescribed strain rate rheometers . for a rheometer operating at a prescribed strain rate , then if @xmath200 goes unstable through @xmath198 ( in eq .",
    "[ eq : dtx ] ) , the stress increases due to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dtsigma ] ) and no attempt is made to control it , leading to instability .",
    "however , consider a rheometer which maintains a prescribed stress .",
    "if the system goes unstable in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dtx ] ) , the bulk stress will change due to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dtsigma ] ) . a sensitive and fast enough",
    "rheometer will respond by adjusting the strain rate accordingly , to maintain the imposed stress .",
    "hence , instability would be determined by the sum @xmath201 .    similarly , in equilibrium systems",
    "a locus of stability may be defined by , for example , the diverging of isothermal or adiabatic , or isobaric or isochoric , response functions ( or the vanishing of the appropriate modulus ) .",
    "for example , the isothermal and adiabatic compressibilities @xmath202 and @xmath203 differ by a term proportional to the quotient of the square of the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath204 and the isobaric heat capacity @xmath205 : @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the specific volume .",
    "@xmath208 vanishes along the spinodal line @xmath209 , while it is evident that @xmath210 ( proportional to the sound speed ) does not .",
    "however , in equilibrium , the critical point is uniquely defined in phase space , which is related to the fact that , for example , pressure is a unique _ function _ of the volume , and is in fact a state variable .",
    "conversely , we can see from the shape of the stress ",
    "strain rate curves for the doi model ( _ e.g. _ fig .",
    "[ fig : constit]c - e ) , that the stress can be a multivalued function of strain rate ; _ i.e. _ it is not a state function .",
    "hence there is no compelling reason to expect critical points at imposed strain rate to be the same as critical points at imposed stress .",
    "similarly , the _ true _ spinodal , or locus of stability , is uniquely defined in an equilibrium system because of the convexity requirement on the entropy @xcite , and there is no such universal convexity requirement ( barring entropy production , which is minimized only under restricted conditions , and only locally rather than globally ) for non - equilibrium systems .",
    "the liquid crystalline suspension under flow , indeed any system which undergoes a macroscopic bulk flow - induced phase transition , is analogous to an equilibrium ternary system comprising species @xmath86 , @xmath211 , and solvent . in our case , the roles of @xmath86 and @xmath211 are played by the rigid rod composition @xmath19 and either the stress @xmath136 or strain rate @xmath95 , depending on the nature of the phase separation . for phase separation at common stress ,",
    "the phase diagram in the stress - composition plane @xmath212 is analogous to the @xmath213 plane for the equilibrium system , while the @xmath117 plane is analogous to the @xmath214 plane . in either case , the density variables , @xmath215 in flow and @xmath216 in the analogous equilibrium system , are different in the two coexisting phases .",
    "the slope of the `` plateau '' in the @xmath217 plane , as the system traverses the two - phase region of the phase diagram , is analogous to a slope in the @xmath218 plane , the latter indicating that the chemical potential ( or osmotic pressure ) of the two phases varies across the coexistence region .",
    "can this analogy be extended to the possibility of phase separation at common stress _ or _ common strain rate ? certainly , one can consider a ternary system under conditions of either imposed @xmath219 or imposed @xmath220 , for which one generally expects difference spinodal lines .",
    "that is , the spinodal is determined by the instability of a matrix in the two - dimensional space spanned by @xmath219 and @xmath221 , and fixing @xmath219 or @xmath220 projects this instability onto different subspaces .",
    "experimental conditions may dictate that the spinodal line under fixed @xmath219 is more likely to be seen by , since @xmath219 is conserved and can not equilibrate quickly to satisfy an imposed @xmath220 .",
    "however , we are not aware of any ternary equilibrium system for which the equilibrium coexistence conditions can differ ; that is , equilibrium is _ always _ specified by equality of @xmath220 and @xmath222 in the two phases , and never by equality of @xmath219 .",
    "in this work we have proposed a straightforward phenomenological extension to the doi model for a solution of rigid rod particles . we have added entropic terms , and included inhomogeneous terms in order to calculate , for the first time , phase separation in shear flow .",
    "the main results of this study are as follows :    1 .",
    "phase separation may occur under conditions of common stress _ or _ common strain rate , with different interface orientations with respect to flow geometry for the two cases .",
    "2 .   although both phase separations are possible , the phase diagrams in the @xmath191 and @xmath188 planes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mu ] ) suggest that phase separation at a common strain rate is metastable .",
    "this can be traced , for this model , to the shear - thinning character of the transition . for a shear thickening transition",
    "an equivalent argument suggests that ( if both are kinematic possibilities ) common stress phase separation is metastable with respect to strain rate phase separation .",
    "3 .   the limits of stability ( `` spinodals '' ) and critical points for systems at prescribed stress and prescribed strain rate differ ; the difference of spinodals is similar to equilibrium behavior , while the difference of critical points is related to the fact that neither stress or strain rate are always unique state functions . 4 .",
    "an argument based on minimizing the chemical potential predicts a complex crossover from common stress to common strain rate phase separation for controlled strain rate experiments .",
    "the veracity of this assumption is unknown .",
    "we have calculated phase coexistence among three phases ( paranematic , flow - aligning nematic , and log - rolling nematic ) , where only two phases existed in equilibrium .",
    "we expect phase coexistence to be the stable configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tieboth ] ) , although phase coexistence could exist as a metastable state with approprate preparation .",

    "experiments have accessed such negative slope composite curves under controlled stress ( rather than controlled strain rate ) conditions @xcite .",

    "the phase boundaries are slightly shifted .",
    "studies at different aspect ratios suggest that shear flow enhances polydispersity effects relative to their effect on equilibrium phase boundaries .",
    "we close by enumerating several open questions .",
    "first , systems such as wormlike micelles probably possess some combination of a perturbed isotropic - nematic transition and a dynamic instability of the molecular constitutive relation .",

    "second , it would be desirable to have a model shear - thickening system in which to calculate properties of banded flows , to compare and contrast with the shear - thinning system studied here and to understand experiments on a wide range of systems , including clays and surfactant systems .",
    "third , we have not addressed the number and possible coarsening of bands and band configurations ; and the kinetics of phase separation has hardly been treated theoretically @xcite , with experiments also at an early stage @xcite . finally , we do not yet know the conditions which may , if at all , distinguish between common stress or common strain rate phase coexistence .",
