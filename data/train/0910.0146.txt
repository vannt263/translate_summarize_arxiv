    "despite the success of the standard model(sm ) there are still unsolved problems in particle physics which motivate searches for more fundamental theories .",
    "one of the most appealing extensions of the sm is the left - right symmetric model based on gauge group @xmath0 where parity is spontaneously broken and smallness of neutrino masses arises naturally .",
    "however like the sm , this left - right symmetric model also suffers from the hierarchy problem : the masses of the higgs scalar diverge quadratically . as in sm ,",
    "supersymmetric(susy ) counterpart of the left - right model cures this hierarchy problem .",
    "hence left - right supersymmetric model @xcite becomes an appealing model which can cure many problems in the standrad model .    among many attractive features of this model",
    "is the capability to explain the smallness of the neutrino mass via so called seesaw mechanism . due to inclusion of right handed neutrino states as a principle ,",
    "such models provide a natural explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses @xcite via see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "this class of models also provide a natural embedding of electroweak hypercharge , giving a physical explanation for the required extra @xmath1 as being generated by the difference between the baryon number ( @xmath2 ) and the lepton number ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the minimal susy left - right model have been reviewed extensively where the number of higgs fields is the smallest possible .",
    "it is found that minimal model suffers from problem with spontaneous parity breaking as we expect parity breaking at low energy theory .",
    "recently , the spontaneous parity violation was shown in an extension of supersymmetric left - right model @xcite where the extra field added to the minimial field content is a bitriplet under @xmath4 .",
    "there are many models which can achieve spontaneous parity breaking by adding more fileds to minimal susylr field content . in the next section",
    "we discuss this minimal susylr model and its extension by adding two extra higgs triplets  @xcite .",
    "then we describe our model with higgs doublets instead of triplets and discuss the possible phenomenology associated with it .",
    "the minimal set of the higgs fields in the non - susy model consists of of a bidoublet @xmath5 and a @xmath6 triplet @xmath7 . in the supersymmetric version ,",
    "the cancellation of chiral anomalies among the fermionic partner of the triplet higgs fields @xmath7 requires introduction of the second triplet @xmath8 with opposite @xmath9 quantum number . due to the conservation of the b - l symmetry ,",
    "@xmath7 does not couple to the leptons and quarks .",
    "another bidoublet @xmath10 is introduced to avoid the trivial kobayashi - maskawa matrix for quarks .",
    "this because supersymmetry forbids a yukawa coupling where the bidoublet appears as a conjugate .",
    "the complete structure of the field content of the minimal supersymmetric left right model is given by @xmath11 @xmath12 where the numbers in the brackets denote the quantum numbers under @xmath13 . also here",
    "the convention is such that @xmath14 under @xmath15 , but @xmath16 under @xmath17 . unlike in mssm here the higgs sector",
    "consists of the bidoublet and triplet superfields : @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 under the left - right symmetry the fields transform as @xmath21 it turns out that left - right symmetry imposes rather strong constraints on the ground state of this model .",
    "it was pointed out by kuchimanchi and mohapatra @xcite that there is no spontaneous parity breaking for this minimal choice of higgs in the supersymmetric left - right model and as such the ground state remains parity symmetric .",
    "if parity odd singlets are introduced to break this symmetry @xcite , then it was shown @xcite that the charge - breaking vacua have a lower potential than the charge - preserving vacua and as such the ground state does not conserve electric charge .",
    "breaking @xmath22 parity was another possible solution to this dilemma of breaking parity symmetry .",
    "however , if one wants to prevent proton decay , then one must look for alternative solutions .",
    "one such possible solution is to add two new triplets superfields @xmath23 , @xmath24 where under parity symmetry @xmath25 .",
    "this field has been explored extensively in @xcite . as worked out in the paper  @xcite in this model",
    "the @xmath17 breaking takes place in two stages . @xmath26",
    "the superpotential then takes the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are symmetric matrices .",
    "it is clear from the above superpotential that the theory has no baryon or lepton number violation terms .",
    "as such @xmath22-parity , defined by @xmath30 , is automatically conserved in the susylr model . in this model",
    "the authors arrive at @xmath31 which relates different symmetry breaking scales .",
    "however this is achieved under the assumption that @xmath32 is of the order of electroweak scale .",
    "also the neutrino masses arise in this model through the so called type ii seesaw mechanism coming from the majorana mass term of the neutrinos . here",
    "we want to explore another possibility of obtaining neutrino masses without introducing majorana neutrino masses but by adding a set of singlet fermions which we discuss below .",
    "in the present paper we discuss another alternative implementation of supersymmetry as well as left - right symmetry with a different seesaw mechanism for generating small standard model neutrino masses .",
    "unlike in the model we discussed in the previous section here the triplets @xmath7 s are replaced by four doublets with odd @xmath33 charge .",
    "we show that the ground state of this model breaks parity and also obeys electromagnetic charge invariance .",
    "also the addition of one parity even singlet @xmath34 per generation will give rise to neutrino masses from so called type iii seesaw mechanism .",
    "although type iii seesaw was already there in the literature  @xcite here we incorporate it within a supersymmetric left - right model and talk about the possible phenomenology .",
    "since we want seesaw only in the leptonic sector we assign appropriate quantum numbers to the singlet such that it couples only to leptons and hence may be worth studying from pamela  @xcite positron excess point of view .",
    "the non - supersymmetric version of the left - right model with type - iii seesaw has been worked out in  @xcite . here",
    "we however consider fermionic singlets instead of triplets(as in conventional type - iii seesaw ) .",
    "the superfields are @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where the numbers in brackets correspond to the quantum numbers corresponding to @xmath39 .",
    "the symmetry breaking pattern is @xmath40 the superpotential relevant for the spontaneous parity violation is given as follows @xmath41 the corresponding f - conditions are @xmath42 here the neutral fields only acquire any vacuum expectation values(vev ) otherwise they will lead to breaking of the electromagnetic charge invariance . also we have neglected the slepton and squark fields since they would have zero vev at the scale considered in our model .",
    "the vacuum of our model should be consistent with the above equations .",
    "we assign the vev s to the neutral fields : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the equations of phenomenological relevance are as follows @xmath50    from the above relations we can show that parity is broken spontaneously and at the same time electromagnetic charge is automatically preserved .",
    "also there is a seesaw between @xmath51 and @xmath52 from the above equations and hence we can arrive at small neutrino masses",
    ". however the effective @xmath53 term becomes @xmath54 which becomes of the order of @xmath55 , the right handed breaking scale which is generally much higher than the electroweak scale .",
    "this will make the standard model higgs bosons @xmath56 very heavy . to avoid this , as shown in the next section we add two extra triplets with @xmath33 charge zero to the above field content .",
    "as we have seen in the last section , keeping the right handed breaking scale higher than the electroweak scale makes the electroweak bosons very heavy .",
    "to get rid of this problem we add two extra triplet superfields @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "these triplets play similar roles in symmetry breaking as in @xcite discussed in section  [ aulakh ] .",
    "although we include them in our model to get rid if the problem just mentioned , our main focus in on the new phenomenology arising from the singlet superfield .",
    "after the inclusion of these extra triplets the superpotential takes the following form @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath29 are symmetric matrices .",
    "+ now for the spontaneous symmetry breaking purpose we need to minimize the scalar potential . in supersymmetric theories minimization of the scalar potential corresponds to @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "writing the f - terms and their component forms as shown in appendix [ sec : ap1 ] will determine the vacua of the model which has to be consistent with those equations .",
    "since only neutral fields can acquire vev we assign them their vevs as follows : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . here",
    "we have assumed @xmath66 so that the terms containing @xmath67 can be neglected . under these conditions",
    "the component form of the f - terms mentioned in appendix [ sec : ap1 ] become @xmath68      after getting the above equations relating different vev s we have to scale them in such a way that these relations remain consistent . from equation [ f2 ]",
    "we have @xmath69 which says that @xmath51 is of the order of gev since @xmath70 are of the order of electroweak scale . from equations [ f4 ] and [ f5 ] , we will get the seesaw relation like @xmath71 which gives the much needed seesaw between the scales @xmath51 and @xmath52 . as we see in the next section",
    "this is crucial to generate small neutrino masses .",
    "we summarize all the energy scales for the consistency of our model in the table [ table1 ] . to keep the effective @xmath53 term at the electroweak scale we set the scale @xmath72 at the electroweak scale . in that case from equation [ f3 ]",
    "it is clear that the scale of @xmath32 should be of the order of @xmath52 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]",
    "the model we have worked out can have various possible phenomenological consequences both from collider as well as astrophysical point of view . among them , neutrino masses , dark matter candidates and leptogenesis are of primary interests .",
    "neutrino masses arise naturally in this model by so called type iii seesaw mechanism .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix in the basis @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "after orthogonalization we get the following expression for @xmath76 mass @xmath77 where @xmath78 the first term in equation [ nu1 ] is the usual type i seesaw contribution .",
    "the second term is the type iii seesaw contribution .",
    "if the elements of the matrix @xmath79 are small compared to those of @xmath80 , then it is easy to see from equations [ nu1 ] and [ nu2 ] that the type i contribution becomes negligible compared to the type iii contribution .",
    "this double seesaw was also worked out in @xcite where the right handed neutrino masses come out after integrating out the extra fermionic singlets @xmath81 .",
    "the smallness of standard model neutrino masses arise naturally by suitable adjustment of the scales @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we can easily get the small @xmath84 neutrino masses using the values given in table [ table1 ] in the above expression . +",
    "it should be noted from the neutrino mass matrix that these mass terms allow the mixing of an r - parity odd singlet fermion @xmath81 with an r - parity even neutrino .",
    "note that the superpotential preserves r parity .",
    "the mild r parity violation occuring in the neutrino mass matrix should be understood as an accidental consequence of @xmath33 gauge symmetry breakdown .",
    "apart from these mass terms there are however no vertices in the model which violate r - parity and hence would not lead to dangerous proton decay .",
    "thus the accidental r - parity breaking in our model is phenomenologically acceptable .",
    "+ in supersymmetric models with conserved r - parity the lightest supersymmetric particle is stable and hence a viable dark matter candidate . in the supersymmetric left - right model with gauged b - l",
    "which we have discussed in the previous section r - parity is automatically conserved except for the mass terms which mixes neutrino with the singlet fermion . in most susy models the neutralinos ( the neutral gauginos and higgsinos ) are the best dark matter candidates since they satisfy the relic density of dark matter as observed by wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) . like the minimal susylr model with type 2 seesaw , in our model",
    "also we have thirteen neutralinos : linear combination of three neutral gauginos and ten neutral higgsinos .",
    "the standard relic abundance analysis can be done for neutralino dark matter using publicly available packages like darksusy@xcite , micromega @xcite etc .",
    "we however are not going to do a detailed analysis of neutralino dark matter in our model . instead of this , we want to focus on some new candidate in our model which can be a dark matter candidate and can overcome the difficulties associated with the usual neutralino as dark matter candidates in existing models .",
    "+ neutralino dark matter scenario has faced severe problems after experimental results from various indirect detection experiments like pamela , atic have come out .",
    "the pamela has observed excess positrons in the cosmic radiation but no excess anti - protons @xcite .",
    "the positron fraction increases as the energy is varied from 10 gev to 100 gev .",
    "although there are many explanations for the observed excess in terms of astrophysical sources @xcite , the connection to dark matter annihilations seems very promising as well as exciting .",
    "however the existing dark matter models in particle physics mostly consider neutralino as a dark matter candidate and neutralinos generally annihilate more preferentially into heavier fermions such as quarks due to helicity suppression of majorana fermions .",
    "thus the standard neutralino dark matter candidate wo nt be able to explain the excess of positrons and simultaneously the lack of antiprotons as observed by the pamela .",
    "+ there have been a large number of attempts to explain the positron excess coming from cold dark matter annihilation .",
    "most of the literature talk about hidden gauge force with a light ( @xmath85gev ) gauge boson and the dark matter particles annihilate via this new gauge boson exchange to lighter fermions ( leptons ) . thus annihilations into quark - antiquark pairs are kinematically forbidden .",
    "this scenerio has been discussed in detail in @xcite and the references therein .",
    "however if we can find some particles within existing frameworks which have no direct coupling to quarks and also can eliminate all the channels through which those particles can annihilate into quark - antiquark pairs while keeping the same channels to leptons open we can possibly explain the observed positron excess .",
    "but while doing so we have to make sure that the dark matter candidate satisy the observed relic abundance constraints also .",
    "that will be slightly non - trivial since in this case the dark matter particle has fewer annihilation channels than the standard neutralino in mssm which may result in very high relic abundance of dark matter .",
    "+    in our model we have two such particles which has no annihilation channels to quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "the singlet fermion @xmath81 and its superpartner @xmath86 .",
    "the superpartner @xmath86 will be naturally protected by r - parity if it is the lightest among the superparticles .",
    "however the singlet fermion @xmath81 can in principle decay to lighter fermions .",
    "but we can incorporate some discrete @xmath87 symmetry under which @xmath88 and hence it will become a stable particle . from the superpotential it is clear that @xmath81 has no direct coupling to quark - antiquarks and being a singlet it has no annihilation channels to quark - antiquarks via s - channel exchange of gauge bosons .",
    "however @xmath81 has direct coupling to leptons .",
    "they can annihilate into electron - positron pairs through t - channel exchange of higgs boson as shown in [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the detailed quantitative analysis of the relic abundance of such a dark matter candidate is a part of future work .",
    "the calculations regarding the positron excess will go on similar footing as done in @xcite .",
    "there they considered the case of a right handed neutrino instead of the sterile fermion @xmath81 we have here .",
    "although the @xmath89 s have similar annihilation channels in our model like right handed neutrinos have in the model @xcite , the mass mechanism is entirely different in the two cases .",
    "+ the leptogenesis mechanism in this model can be very different from the usual susylr model due to the absence of higgs triplets with even b - l where the leptogenesis arises from the doubly charged higgs or a heavy neutrino .",
    "this has been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "apart from all these this new model can have good collider phenomenology in terms of the extra fermionic singlets .",
    "these singlets can be produced in the collider through processes like @xmath90 by the channel shown in [ fig:1 ] where the leptons @xmath91 can come from various intermediate products like photons , z bosons etc .",
    "we have implemented type iii seesaw in the minimal supersymmetric left right model by replacing the b - l even higgs triplets with b - l odd higgs doublets and an extra fermionic singlet per generation .",
    "we have also shown that the minimization of the scalar potential gives us a vacuum which does not allow left - right symmetry .",
    "thus spontaneous parity violation can be naturally achieved .",
    "we have also shown the neutrino mass matrix in our model where the small standard model neutrino masses can be obtained by suitable adjustment of various scales of symmetry breaking consistent with the f - term conditions .",
    "we have also commented on the possible dark matter candidates in the model .",
    "since r - parity is conserved in our model except for the mass terms mixing neutrino with the singlet fermion , the neutralinos are of course good dark matter candidates like in many supersymmetric models .",
    "apart from that the extra fermion @xmath81 as well as its superpartner boson @xmath86 can be more interesting as dark matter candidates from experiments like pamela , atic point of view since they have annihilation channels only into leptons and not to quarks .",
    "we have also mentioned the possible channel which would be of interest in the collider aspects of these new singlet fermions .",
