    "the fast development in nanotechnologies has spurred the investigation of quantum effects in electronic devices at submicron scale  @xcite . in past years , the attention has been devoted mostly to the study of charge transport and related phenomena in electronic nanocircuits  @xcite . here",
    "spectacular effects have been predicted and also experimentally observed , including quantum interference pattern  @xcite , single electron injection and control in quantum conductors  @xcite and coherent behavior in hybrid devices  @xcite .",
    "+ conversely , the question how thermodynamic aspects such as heat transport , power conversion and energy exchange work at the nanoscale has posed new interesting challenges  @xcite .",
    "a precise control and manipulation of heat flows in quantum conductors can lead to interesting applications , i.e. , new logic devices based purely on thermal transport . towards this goal , pioneering experiments have achieved the phase control of coherent thermal transport in hybrid quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "+ in this respect , the possibility to tune and control some physical parameters by means of external fields and time - dependent potential is of great interest  @xcite .",
    "indeed , periodically driven system can be immediately associated to thermal machines or heat engines which are based on cyclic operations .",
    "different papers focused on the effects induced by an external driving field both in closed and open quantum systems .",
    "for example , the influence of an ac field on the efficiency of thermoelectric setups or heat pumping mechanism on quantum dot based devices have been investigated  @xcite .",
    "+ dynamical aspects of time - dependent energy and heat flows have been addressed in order to understand fundamental thermodynamical problems such as energy exchange , work distribution and entropy production ( see reviews  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ interestingly , locally applied time - dependent voltages can lead to heat pumping mechanisms in quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "the peculiar characteristic of heat pumps is that a direct heat current is generated by a purely ac drive which acts against some present thermal gradients .",
    "moreover , it can also generate dc finite current signals even in a purely equilibrium situation , in absence of any thermal or voltage bias  @xcite .",
    "+ recently , a lot of attention has also been put on the interplay between heat and spin transport properties , in the emerging research field of spin caloritronics @xcite .",
    "thermally driven spin sources are very interesting for the improvement of spintronic devices , which are believed to be more efficient with respect to their electronic counterparts  @xcite . striking",
    "experimental results in this field have extended thermoelectric concept to spin transport by the observation of spin - seebeck @xcite and spin - peltier @xcite effects in magnetic systems .",
    "intriguingly , spin - dependent effective temperatures of electrons were observed in nanopillar spin valves powered by a heat source , thus showing that electron heat conduction can depend on the spin degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "+ among all mesoscopic systems for the investigation of spin transport properties , a relevant role is certainly played by two - dimensional topological insulators ( 2dtis)@xcite . these system are constituted by a wide bulk gap and charge and energy transport are mediated by the presence of edge states .",
    "these are constituted by two counter - propagating electronic states with opposite spin polarization ( spin - momentum locking ) , and are also called helical edge states  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as long as time - reversal symmetry is preserved , electrons flowing along these edge states are topologically protected against backscattering and transport occurs in the so - called ballistic regime  @xcite .",
    "experimental evidences of 2dtis were reported in cdte / hgte @xcite and inas / gasb @xcite quantum wells and have been predicted for a large class of new materials which relies on the presence of strong spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .",
    "these systems constitute an interesting playground to study coherent heat transport in which the spin degree of freedom can play a non - trivial role  @xcite . moreover , the unavoidable presence of e - e interactions in helical edge states  @xcite can dramatically affect the dynamics and have important consequences on thermal transport properties  @xcite .",

    "we consider a 2dti device in a double quantum point contact geometry  @xcite . in this setup tunneling of electrons",
    "is allowed by the presence of constrictions and can lead to quantum interference effects .",
    "we also introduce a model to couple electrons of the top edge to a local time - dependent gate potential located above a single qpc .",
    "our aim is to investigate the generation of a direct heat current by the time - dependent drive along the edge of a 2dti .",
    "we demonstrate that the presence of an ac field can generate dc finite current signals in absence of thermal or voltage bias , relying on a quantum pumping mechanism .",
    "we inspect the interplay with the peculiar spin properties of helical edge states , demonstrating that in the proposed setup a polarized heat current can be enstaured , carried solely by a single spin species .",
    "finally , the presence of e - e interactions can strongly modify the behavior of the heat pumped current in this device .",

    "it turns out that in the non - interacting case also pumped charge current is fully polarized and carried solely by spin @xmath2 electrons .",
    "the presence of interactions induces the same qualitative changes discussed for the heat current and the associated oscillations can be explained in full analogy to what happens for @xmath110 .     and heat current @xmath173 , as a function of the gate amplitude @xmath138 . in the upper panel @xmath80(non - interacting case ) and in the lower panel @xmath153 .",

    "the pumping mechanism relies on the presence of an external gate potential placed on top of one of the two constrictions which acts on the system with an external ac field .",
    "we have developed a microscopic model of the coupling between the external gate and the electrons of the edge states of the 2dti .",
    "we have therefore evaluated the average heat and charge currents pumped into the system as a function of various parameters , taking also into account the presence of e - e interactions . in the non - interacting case , this setup generates finite heat current which is carried solely by a single spin species , resulting into a fully polarized heat flow .",

    "<S> we consider transport properties of a two dimensional topological insulator in a double quantum point contact geometry in presence of a time - dependent external field . in the proposed setup </S>",
    "<S> an external gate is placed above a single constriction and it couples only with electrons belonging to the top edge . this asymmetric configuration and the presence of an ac signal </S>",
    "<S> allow for a quantum pumping mechanism , which , in turn , can generate finite heat and charge current in an unbiased device configuration . </S>",
    "<S> a microscopic model for the coupling with the external time - dependent gate potential is developed and the induced finite heat and charge current are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that in the non - interacting case , heat flow is associated with a single spin component , due to the helical nature of the edge states , and therefore a finite and polarized heat current is obtained in this configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of e - e interchannel interactions strongly affects the current signal , lowering the degree of polarization of the system . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also show that separate heat and charge flows can be achieved , varying the amplitude of the external gate . </S>"
