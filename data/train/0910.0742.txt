    "whether or not the physical constants are truly constant is not only a fundamental issue in physics but also an important probe of the theories of extra dimensions . since the early studies of dirac @xcite , many theoretical models that could accomodate the variation of physical constants have been proposed @xcite .",
    "unification theories such as superstring theories predict the existence of an additional scalar field @xmath9 called  dilaton \" and the destabilization of this field @xcite might cause the variation of coupling constants . in",
    "more phenomenological contexts , dynamical scalar fields introduced to explain the recent discovery of the accerelated expansion may be non - minimally coupled to gauge fields in the standard model , which may also lead to time varying coupling constants @xcite .",
    "thus , investigating the variation of the coupling constants can be an important probe of these theories .",
    "not only these theoretical sides but also the observational analysis of various systems have been playing an important role in the investigation of the time variation of physical constants . among them , the claim for the deviation of the past value of the fine structure constant @xmath6 from the present one by using the high - redshift quasar absorption system @xcite had the great impact on this topic .",
    "further analysis for the quasar absorption spectra gives the support for this positive result of a cosmological variation of @xmath6 @xcite , though some authors takes objection to such variations @xcite .",
    "stimulated by these studies from both theoretical and observational sides , various constraints on the time variation of the fine structure constant @xmath6 have been investigated from diverse observations .",
    "we briefly summarize those terrestrial and celestial limits on @xmath6 as follows ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the atomic clocks constrain the current value of the temporal derivative of @xmath6 as @xmath10@xcite .",
    "the measurement of the frequency ratio of aluminium and mercury single - ion optical clocks provides @xmath11 @xcite . from the analysis of sm isotopes in the oklo natural reactor in gabon , we get two bounds on the variation of @xmath6 as @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite , which measures the value at the redshift @xmath14 constraint . from the spectra of quasars ,",
    "several limits have been obtained using various data sets : @xmath15 ) from the keck / hires instrument @xcite , @xmath16 from the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) instrument @xcite .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) provides constraints at very high redshifts ( @xmath17 ) , for example , @xmath18 @xcite . finally , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measures @xmath6 at @xmath19 and the limits from wmap 1-year , 3-year and 5-year data read @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath22 @xcite respectively , all of which are at @xmath23 recently , menegoni et al .",
    "@xcite obtained more improved result @xmath24 at @xmath23 from wmap 5-year date combined with acbar , quad and bicep experiments data .    along with @xmath6 ,",
    "several observational constraints have been obtained on another physical constant , the proton - to - electron mass ratio @xmath25 . as in @xmath6 , atomic clocks",
    "very tightly constrain the current value of its temporal derivative as @xmath26@xcite .",
    "reinhold et al .",
    "@xcite reports the non - vanishing variation of @xmath27 as @xmath28 from a weighted sum of accurate @xmath29 spectral lines in two quasar systems ( corresponding redshifts are @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) . based on the quasar absorption spectra of @xmath32 , the limit is @xmath33 at @xmath34 @xcite and further detailed measurement by the same method tighten the bound as @xmath35 @xcite .    in this paper , using wmap 5-year data , we focus on the cmb constraint on @xmath6 in the case that the multiple physical constants may vary with time simultaneously according to the expectation values of a single dilaton field @xmath9 .",
    "although similar analyses has been done for bbn @xcite , quasar absorption system @xcite or the oklo reactor @xcite , few attempts from cmb data have been made except for several preceding literatures @xcite , which treated simultaneous variations of only @xmath6 and @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to @xmath6 and @xmath1 , many theoretical models predict the time variation of the qcd scale @xmath3 ( which results from the variation of the strong coupling constant ) , so it is important to include the @xmath3 effect in the analysis .",
    "we consider the effect of varying @xmath3 as the change in the proton mass @xmath2 which is assumed to be proportional to @xmath3 , the neutron mass also changes . in this paper",
    ", we neglect the difference between the proton mass and the neutron mass , and when we refer to the time variation of the proton mass @xmath2 , we implicitly include the time variation of the neutron mass assuming that the neutron mass changes in exactly the same way as the proton mass . ] .",
    "thus , we consider simultaneous variation of @xmath6 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . since how the variation of @xmath3 is related to that of @xmath6 or @xmath1",
    "depends on the details of the unification model @xcite , we here adopt a specific example of the relation among those physical constants following @xcite or @xcite , which is based on a low energy effective theory of string theory .",
    "the newly incorporated change of @xmath3 leads to a new and tighter constraint on the time variation of @xmath6 .",
    "we also obtain a constraint on @xmath27 induced by the time dependence of @xmath36 and @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : effect ] provides how the variation of each physical constant affects the cmb power spectrum both qualitatively and quantitatively with particular attention to @xmath3 .",
    "section [ sec : dilaton ] briefly describes the model we adopt based on string theory which governs the time evolution of the three physical constants we consider , namely , the variation of the fine structure constant , the electron mass and the proton mass . in section",
    "[ sec : constraint ] , we provide the limits of those variations .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusion .",
    "the details of the calculations of the degeneracy and parameter dependence are given in the appendix a. in appendix b , we present a forecast for constraints from the planck experiment .",
    "as is well known , a primary cmb photon is a relic signal from the last scattering surfuce about thirteen billion years ago , which means that the most important process for cmb photon is the recombination .",
    "it has been known that changing the value of the fine structure constant @xmath6 and the electron mass @xmath1 affects the cmb power spectrum mainly through the change of the epoch of recombination @xcite .",
    "the larger value of @xmath6 or @xmath1 at the recombination epoch causes the higher redshift of the last scattering surface because the hydrogen binding energy scales as @xmath37 .",
    "this results in three characteristic signatures in the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropy , namely , shift of the peaks to higher multipoles , increase of the height of the peaks due to the enhanced early integrated sachs wolfe effect , and decrease of the small - scale diffusion damping effect . to be more precise , however ,",
    "the process of the recombination depend on @xmath6 and @xmath1 in a subtly different manner as will be explicitly shown in eqs.([4v-1])-([4v-4 ] ) in the argument of the four cmb - characteristic variables below .",
    "the time variation of the proton mass @xmath2 affects the cmb power spectrum mainly through the baryon density @xmath38 . in the standard cosmology with no variation of physical constants , the baryon density scales as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the scale factor and the subscripts  rec \" and  0 \" denote values at the epoch of recombination and the present epoch , respectively .",
    "when we allow the time variation of @xmath41 , there is an additional change as @xmath42 where we define @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the effect of changing @xmath44 is very similar to changing @xmath45 .",
    "one may even consider that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are totally degenerate .",
    "however , there appears a subtle difference as regards the baryon number density @xmath46 which affects the recombination process .",
    "this is because , contrary to the case of @xmath38 , the scaling @xmath47 is not affected by the variation of @xmath41 ( note that @xmath48 )",
    ". thus , suppose one increases @xmath45 and decreases @xmath44 while preserving the value of @xmath49 , @xmath50 is increased .",
    "this is the reason why varying @xmath45 ( as is done in the usual parameter search ) and varying @xmath44 are different and we can break the degeneracy between them in the parameter estimation although the degeneracy turns out to be rather strong .",
