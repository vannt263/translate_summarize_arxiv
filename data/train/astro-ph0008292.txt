    "calculations of the reflected spectrum expected from x  ray illumination of an accretion disk around a black hole are extremely important .",
    "the reflected continuum and especially its associated iron k@xmath0 fluorescence line ( see e.g.  basko , sunyaev & titarchuk 1974 ; lightman & white 1988 ; george & fabian 1991 ; matt , perola & piro 1991 ) are perhaps the only spectral features expected from optically thick material in the vicinity of a black hole , so can be used to test theoretical models of accretion in strong gravity ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 , dabrowski et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "this is especially relevant since there is much current debate on the structure of the accretion flow .",
    "the `` standard '' accretion disk models of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 : hereafter ss ) are clearly incomplete .",
    "they can produce uv and soft x  ray emission , but not the hard x  ray power law out to 200 kev .",
    "this is observed to carry a significant fraction of the luminosity in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and galactic black hole candidates ( gbhc ) in their low / hard state .",
    "something other than the ss disk is required .",
    "the two current candidates are either magnetic reconnection regions above the accretion disk , or that some part of the accretion flow is in an alternative ( non  disk ) configuration .",
    "the idea of magnetically powered active regions above a disk ( e.g. galeev , rosner & vaiana 1979 ) gained considerable plausibility from the recent discovery that the accretion disk viscosity is driven by a magnetic dynamo ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) .",
    "buoyancy could then make the magnetic loops rise to the top of the disk , where the optical depth is low so that the energy released in reconnection can not thermalize ( e.g. di matteo 1998 ) .",
    "such active regions could give the hard x  ray spectra which are seen from agn and galactic black hole candidates ( haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ; stern et al .",
    "1995 ; beloborodov 1999a , b ) .",
    "spectral transitions between the low / hard state and the high / soft state in gbhc might then be associated with the disk becoming radiation pressure dominated .",
    "this occurs at a few percent of the eddington accretion rate , roughly as observed in cyg  x1 and other gbhcs .",
    "perhaps magnetic buoyancy transfers more energy out of the disk and into a corona in gas dominated disks than in radiation pressure dominated ones ( nayakshin 1999a ) .",
    "current ( though still incomplete ) mhd simulations do show strong magnetic fields in the low density regions above and below the disk ( hawley 2000 ) , although they do not yet carry enough power to reproduce the observed low / hard state ( miller & stone 2000 ) .",
    "the idea of an alternative accretion flow became a serious contender with the rediscovery of another stable solution of the accretion flow equations for mass accretion rates below @xmath1 per cent of eddington .",
    "the standard ss disk model derives the accretion flow structure in the limit where the gravitational potential energy is radiated locally .",
    "this assumption is relaxed in the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) models , so that the energy can be transported radially ( advected ) , as well as radiated locally .",
    "there are two key ( and currently uncheckable ) assumptions underlying this : firstly that the viscosity mechanism gives the accretion energy to the protons ( as opposed to both protons and electrons ) and secondly that the protons transfer this energy to the electrons only via ( rather slow ) electron  ion ( coulomb ) collisions .",
    "this gives an accretion flow which is optically thin , geometrically thick and _ hot _ , with typical electron temperatures of order 200 kev as observed ( e.g. narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "this model provides a rather natural explanation for the low / hard to high / soft spectral state transitions in gbhcs , as adafs can not exist at high mass accretion rates .",
    "the electron ",
    "ion collision rate increases with the density of the flow , and so above a mass accretion rate of @xmath1 per cent of eddington ( as long as the disk viscosity parameter @xmath2 ; esin , mcclintock & narayan 1997 , quataert & narayan 1999 ) the electrons can drain most of the energy from the protons .",
    "advection is then unimportant as the electrons radiate the gravitational energy released locally , and the flow collapses into an ss disk .    in the one model",
    ", there is an optically thick disk extending down to the last stable orbit at 3 schwarzschild radii . in the alternative ,",
    "the inner disk is truncated , with the optically thick , cool flow replaced by an optically thin , x  ray hot plasma .",
    "the reflected spectrum gives an observational test between these two scenarios .",
    "firstly the amount of reflection should be different .",
    "a disk with active regions above it should subtend a solid angle of roughly @xmath3 , whereas a truncated disk with the x  ray hot plasma filling the `` hole '' in the disk will subtend a rather smaller solid angle . secondly",
    ", for the ss disk there is material down to the last stable orbit .",
    "reflection features from the inner disk should then be strongly smeared and skewed by the combination of special and general relativistic effects expected in the vicinity of a black hole ( fabian et al .",
    "this material is not present in the truncated disk models , so they should have narrower lines .",
    "the seminal asca observation of the agn mcg63015 showed that the line is so broad that accretion disk models require that the material extends down to _ at least _ the last stable orbit in a schwarzschild metric ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ) , and that it subtends a solid angle of @xmath4 with respect to the x  ray source ( lee et al 1999 ) .",
    "this very clear cut result gives strong support for the existence of an ss accretion disk , although other interpretations in terms of optically thick , highly ionized cloudlets close to the black hole rather than a smooth disk flow may be possible ( karas et al 2000 ) .",
    "however , the line and reflected continuum seen from the gbhcs in their low / hard state ( where the x  ray continuum bears a remarkable similarity to that from seyfert 1 type agn ) are _ not _ the same as that seen in mcg63015 .",
    "the gbhc have reflection amplitudes which are rather less than expected for a hard x  ray source above a disk ( e.g. gierlinski et al . 1997",
    "; done &  1999 ) .",
    "the iron line does not generally show the extreme smearing associated with material within 5 schwarzschild radii , although there is detectable broadening of the line showing that there is cool , optically thick material within @xmath5 schwarzschild radii ( , done & smith 1997 ; 1998 ; 1999 ; done & 1999 ) .",
    "it is also emerging that while some seyfert 1 agn do have extremely broadened iron lines like mcg63015 ( e.g. ngc 3516 ; nandra et al .",
    "1999 ) , others look more like the gbhc in not having the extreme skewed lines expected from the very inner disk ( e.g. ic4329a ; done , madejski &  2000 ) , and that many do not show reflection subtending the expected @xmath3 solid angle ( smith & done 1996 ; zdziarski , lubiski & smith 1999 ) .",
    "can this be interpreted as a strong evidence that the accretion flow is not always given by an optically thick disk ?",
    "such a conclusion is plainly consistent with the data .",
    "perhaps the objects with extreme line profiles have high mass accretion rates , where the adaf s can not exist .",
    "perhaps these are the analogue of the gbhc in their high / soft state ( done &  1999 ; zdziarski et al . 1999 ) .",
    "alternatively , ross , fabian & young ( 1999 ) argue that the lack of strong reflection and extreme relativistic smearing does not necessarily imply the absence of an inner disk , because the reflection signature from the disk can be masked by complex ionization effects . for completely ionized gas , there is no photo  electric absorption opacity left , so the reflected spectrum is simply due to electron scattering in the disk atmosphere .",
    "there is then no characteristic iron line or edge feature from the inner disk , so the extreme relativistically smeared components of the line are not present .    however , illumination of a disk with density given by the ss models results in a power law distribution of ionization state with radius ( ross & fabian 1993 ; matt , fabian & ross 1993 ) .",
    "this does not fit the data when the inner radii have a high enough ionization to mask their reflected signature (  et al .",
    ", 1998 ; 1999 ; done & 1999 ) .",
    "the key problem is that the observed reflected spectra from the low / hard state gbhc are relatively neutral (  et al . , 1998 ; 1999 ; done &  1999 ) . yet",
    "if the inner disk is extremely ionized , then there should exist a transition region in which the disk is cool enough for h and he  like iron to exist , before getting to the low  to  moderate ionization material at larger radii .",
    "these species give an unmistakable reflected signature , with very strong , highly ionized line and edge features ( lightman & white 1988 ; ross & fabian 1993 ; matt , fabian & ross 1993ab ;  et al . , 1994 ; matt , fabian & ross 1996 ; ross , fabian & brandt 1996 ) , which are simply not present in the data .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that either the disk really does subtend a small solid angle to the x  ray source , or that its ionization state drops dramatically ( as a step function rather than a power law ) from extreme ionization to relatively neutral ( done &  1999 ) , or / and that the x  ray source does not illuminate the inner disk ( e.g. through the anisotropic illumination pattern resulting from trans  relativistic outflow from magnetic reconnection : beloborodov 1999a , b ) .",
    "this argument is based on reflection models which neglect the energy change which can result from compton scattering below @xmath6 kev , and assume that the ionization state is constant with depth in the material .",
    "in practice , at high ionization states the electron temperature in the disk can be high enough to cause appreciable comptonization smearing of the resulting reflected spectrum and line .",
    "also , there is vertical ionization structure of the illuminated material , the details of which depend on the vertical density structure of the disk ( ross & fabian 1993 ; et al 1994 ; matt , fabian & ross 1996 ; ross , fabian & young 1999 ) .",
    "ross , fabian & young ( 1999 ) argue that these effects alone are sufficient to hide the otherwise unmistakable signature of highly ionized reflection from h and he like iron , but this has yet to be tested against real data .",
    "however , all these works use an _ assumed _ vertical density structure .",
    "this is a very crude simplification , which can severely misrepresent the reflection signature from the disk ( nayakshin 1999b ; ross , fabian & young 1999 ) .",
    "x  ray illumination _",
    "changes _ the density structure of the material .",
    "material at the top of the disk is heated by the illumination , and so can expand , lowering its density .",
    "deeper into the disk there is less x  ray heating , so the material is cooler , and hence denser .",
    "the self  consistent density structure is especially important as there is a thermal ionization instability which affects x  ray illuminated material in pressure balance ( field 1965 ; krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ; kallman & white 1989 ; ko & kallman 1994 ; r@xmath7aska & czerny 1996 ; r@xmath7aska 1999 ; nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 , hereafter nkk ) .",
    "this can result in the ionization state of the material changing very rapidly , with a highly ionized skin forming on top of a mainly neutral disk .",
    "if the ionization state of the skin is high enough to completely strip iron then it is almost completely reflective , and forms no spectral features .",
    "the observed reflected signature is then dominated by photons reflected from deeper in the disk , where the material is mainly neutral .",
    "although the material is still expected to be less ionized at larger radii , the meaning of less ionized is very different from that in the constant density models  the skin remains completely ionized with a negligible amount of h and he  like iron , but its thomson depth decreases with radius ( see nayakshin 2000 ) .",
    "the instability gives a physical mechanism for a discontinuous transition in ionization state , as required by the data .",
    "the small observed solid angle subtended by the disk could then be an artifact of fitting single zone ionization models to data from systems with more complex ionization structure .",
    "ideally we would want to reanalyze the data , fitting these x  ray illuminated disk reflection models to derive the solid angle subtended by the reflecting material . if these models give a worse fit to the data than the single ionization models , or if they give a derived solid angle of the reflector which is much less than @xmath3 then the `` hole in the disk '' geometry inferred from the single zone ionization models is still favored . if instead the complex ionization reflector models are a better fit to the data and give a solid angle which is compatible with @xmath3 then the ss disk with magnetic coronal x  ray source is probably correct , and the previous results which ruled out this geometry are a model dependent interpretation of the data .    however , direct data fitting is prohibitively cpu intensive . the models require simultaneous computation of the hydrostatic , ionization and energy balance for the illuminated gas plus optically thick radiation transfer and relativistic effects to determine the reflected spectrum .",
    "a single model calculation requires @xmath8 day of cpu on a 500 mhz workstation .",
    "given this , we have chosen to tackle the inverse problem . instead of fitting real data with the complex ionization reflector code",
    ", we use the complex ionization reflector code to synthesize a spectrum with the same signal  to  noise and spectral resolution as given from typical _ ginga _ observations of the low / hard state spectra from galactic black hole candidates .",
    "we then fit this model spectrum with the standard ( and computationally very fast ) single zone ionization reflection models which are widely used in x  ray spectral analysis .",
    "we can then quantify the effect of using the single zone ionization reflection models to describe a more complex ionization disk structure .",
    "we show that the resulting spectra from a complex ionization structure disk subtending a solid angle of @xmath3 are well fit over the 220 kev range by the single zone reflection models , but that the presence of the ionized skin leads to an underestimate of the covering fraction of the reflector .",
    "the ss disk models then can not be ruled out by the fact that single zone ionization reflector models derive a solid angle of @xmath9 .",
    "the complex ionization structure disks can also produce a correlation between the amount of reflection as measured by the single zone ionization models and the spectral index ( as observed e.g. by zdziarski et al . , 1999 ) _ without _ changing the solid angle subtended by the disk .",
    "we end by discussing how we can observationally distinguish between the truncated disk models and complex ionization structure .",
    "we use the code of nkk to calculate the reflected spectrum from an x  ray illuminated disk atmosphere .",
    "this code computes the vertical structure assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , solving simultaneously for the density , ionization structure and energy balance of the illuminated gas , as well as doing the radiative transfer for the continuum and emission lines .",
    "locally , the amount of photo  ionization can be described by the parameter , @xmath10 , which is the ratio of the illuminating radiation pressure ( @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the illuminating hard x  ray flux ) to the gas pressure ( @xmath13 acting outwards , where @xmath14 is the hydrogen density and t is the temperature ) .",
    "this relates to the more usual density ionization parameter @xmath15 by @xmath16 .    as results of nkk show ,",
    "the vertical density structure of the illuminated layer is rather complex ( see also nayakshin & kallman 2000 ) , as the gas in radiative equilibrium with the illuminating x ",
    "rays is subject to a thermal pressure ionization instability ( krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ) . in the context of the given problem",
    ", the instability can be described as following .",
    "the x  ray heating clearly depends on height , with the material at the top of the layer being heated the most . because the material is in pressure balance ,",
    "the gas pressure is smallest at the top of the disk , so @xmath17 is at its maximum here .",
    "this corresponds to the uppermost stable branch of the ionization equilibrium s  curve ( see fig . 1 in nkk ) , with low density material which is highly or completely ionized .",
    "atomic cooling is negligible so the temperature is a fraction of the local compton temperature ( see krolik et al . , 1981 and nayakshin 2000a ) ; compton heating is balanced by bremsstrahlung and compton cooling .",
    "going deeper down into the disk , the x  ray heating decreases with optical depth to electron scattering , @xmath18 , and the gas pressure increases .",
    "hence , both the temperature and ionization parameter @xmath17 decrease .",
    "however , there is then a turning point on the s  curve ( point c in fig . 1 of nkk ) .",
    "at this point the temperature and density is such that the rapidly increasing bremsstrahlung cooling causes the temperature to dramatically decrease .",
    "this pulls the gas pressure down , but hydrostatic equilibrium requires that the gas pressure must monotonically increase as a function of depth into the disk .",
    "the only way for the pressure to increase in a region with rapidly decreasing temperature is to rapidly increase the density , but this pushes up the cooling still further , and so decreases the temperature .",
    "ionic and atomic species can now exist , so line transitions give a yet further increase in the cooling .",
    "eventually this stabilizes onto the bottom part of the s curve , where the x  ray heating is balanced primarily by line cooling from low temperature , high density material .",
    "this results in an almost discontinuous transition from a highly ionized , hot and relatively tenuous skin to mainly neutral , cool and relatively dense material over a very small ( @xmath19  see appendix in nkk ) change in optical depth at @xmath20 few .",
    "the optical depth where this instability occurs plus the compton temperature ( which depends on the illuminating power law as well as the local thermal disk spectrum ) are the main determinants of the resulting reflected spectrum .",
    "the majority of the reflected flux arises from the hot layer if its optical depth @xmath21 .",
    "the reflected spectrum then contains the imprints of the ionized material which can be either highly ionized ( where iron is mainly he or h  like ) , or extremely ionized ( where even iron is completely stripped of bound electrons ) depending on the equilibrium compton temperature ( nayakshin & kallman 2000 ) . for smaller optical depths , @xmath22 ,",
    "most of the reflection occurs in material below the ionization instability point , so the reflected spectrum contains the signatures of the cool material at low ionization states .",
    "nkk define a dimensionless parameter @xmath23 , which is essentially the ratio between the gravity force and that from the x  ray radiation pressure ( @xmath24 ) . where gravity is dominant ( @xmath25 ) then the vertical disk structure is close to that of an un  illuminated disk ( assumed here for simplicity to be the gaussian density profile expected from a gas pressure dominated disk : shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) and the optical depth of the hot , ionized layer is very small .",
    "conversely , where @xmath26 then the illumination determines much of the vertical structure , and the optical depth of the hot layer is large .",
    "nkk give a simple analytic approximation to this hot layer optical depth of @xmath27 ( see also kallman & white 1989 ; nayakshin 2000 for more accurate analytical estimates of @xmath18 ) .",
    "given that the observations of flat spectrum agn and low / hard state gbhc seem to show small but not negligible amounts of low to moderate ionization reflection , then the parameters which are most likely to reproduce this are @xmath28 , which corresponds to @xmath29 for hard spectra .",
    "if the compton temperature in the upper , ionized skin is high enough then the reflected spectrum from this will be featureless , and so not detected in x  ray spectral fitting .",
    "the observable reflection signature will then be given only by the material below the ionization instability point , where the incoming flux has been decreased by scattering in the hot layer .",
    "this reflected continuum then has to escape out through the hot layer , so scattering again reduces its amplitude and introduces some broadening to the reflected features",
    ".    a truly self  consistent model should uniquely determine the illuminating flux at the surface of the disk as a function of the system parameters ( mass , radius and mass accretion rate through the disk ) .",
    "since the x  ray energy generation mechanism for magnetic flares is not yet understood in detail then such a model is not yet available .",
    "instead we _ assume _ a given x ",
    "ray illuminating flux in order to demonstrate the physical behavior of a disk atmosphere irradiated by magnetic flares .",
    "we calculate the angle averaged upward reflected spectra ( corresponding to an inclination of @xmath30 ) resulting from a disk at @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , the schwarzschild radius ) , with an accretion rate of @xmath33 onto a super  massive black hole of @xmath34 .",
    "the large black hole mass means that we avoid disk photons potentially contributing to the observed bandpass .",
    "we assume a power law illuminating continuum with exponential cutoff at 200 kev .",
    "the illumination parameter is fixed at @xmath35 , and the resulting angle averaged upward reflected spectra ( so corresponding to an inclination of @xmath30 ) are calculated for photon indices of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we do not include any general or special relativistic shifts for simplicity .",
    "figure [ fig : spectr_tempr ] shows the reflected spectra ( without the illuminating power law ) and the gas temperature profiles for the 6 different values of @xmath38 .",
    "we simulate a 10ks observation with the ginga x  ray satellite , using the fakeit command in xspec ( arnaud 1998 ) , adding 0.5 per cent systematic errors to the results since it seems unlikely that any satellite will be calibrated to better than this limit .",
    "we compare these simulated spectra with the angle dependent reflection code of magdziarz & zdziarski ( 1995 ) , with ion populations calculated as in done et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , implemented in the pexriv model in xspec .",
    "this calculates the continuum reflection for an input spectrum which is a power law with exponential cutoff . it does not include the associated iron line , so this is put in as a narrow ( intrinsic width fixed at @xmath39 kev ) gaussian line of free normalization , and energy ( except that this latter is constrained to be between 5.5 and 7.5 kev , as expected for iron with some shifts allowed for doppler and gravitational effects ) .",
    "we assume solar abundances ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) and an inclination of @xmath40 .",
    "we also include a free absorbing column in our fits so as to match as closely as possible the uncertainties which arise in fitting real data .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the spectral index and amount of reflection inferred from fitting the simulated datasets with the pexriv model , with full results given in table 1 .",
    "there is a clear correlation of the amount of reflection and its ionization state with spectral index . for hard spectra",
    "the ionization of the detected reflected spectrum is low , and the amount of reflection is much less than unity .",
    "this is because the compton temperature of the upper layer of the disk is high , its ionization is extreme and it is thomson thick ( @xmath41 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectr_tempr ] ) .",
    "this produces a reflected spectrum which is mostly from electron scattering in the skin , which has few spectral features and can not easily be identified as reflected flux .",
    "the ionization drops dramatically at the depth where the ionization instability sets in , so there is also a small reflected component from low ionization material which is fit by the pexriv model .",
    "however , this itself has to escape out through the skin , and so some fraction is compton scattered , reducing the line and edge features from the low ionization reflected spectrum , but keeping its overall shape .    for steeper spectra the compton temperature of the upper layers drops , so that its ionization is not so extreme , leading to strong spectral features from the ionized upper layer , plus the skin is actually thinner ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and hence most of the reflected flux is easily identified .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] also shows the detected line equivalent width .",
    "it is generally low , but consistent with the theoretically expected equivalent width for the given ionization state ( assuming that resonant trapping is not important ) and spectral index , scaled by the observed solid angle (  & czerny 1994 ; george & fabian 1991 ) .",

    "the only observable reflected signature then comes from the material below the ionization instability , which has low  to  moderate ionization .",
    "the instability suppresses any signature of h and he  like iron , which was the key argument used by done &  ( 1999 ) against substantial ionization of the disk .",
    "where the optical depth in the ionized skin is @xmath144 then the observed reflected spectrum and line derived from single zone ionization models is suppressed by about a factor 34 , as observed in the flattest agn and gbhc .",
    "thus , the geometry in which the disk covers half the sky as seen from the x  ray source ( e.g. , magnetic flares above a disk ) _ can _ be consistent with the observed data because the reflected spectra computed with hydrostatic balance models _ appear _ to have a small reflection fraction when fitted with the current single  zone models .",
    "however , more detailed studies of this issue , with radial stratification of the skin properties , and with effects of possible x  ray induced evaporation ( which is important for magnetic flares , see nkk ) is needed to resolve the issue truly self  consistently .",
    "we estimate that thomson depth of the skin should be in the range of unity to few to explain spectra typical of hard state of gbhcs . at first glance",
    ", this seems to be a rather narrow range in parameter space , making the model appear contrived .",
    "however , the dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath12 becomes very weak once @xmath145 , because the incident x ",
    "rays are efficiently down  scattered in the skin . as discussed by kallman & white ( 1989 ) and nayakshin ( 2000a )",
    ", it is then very difficult to produce @xmath146 a few even with arbitrarily large values of @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the range of `` acceptable '' values of thomson depths , @xmath147few , may actually correspond to a change in the x  ray ionizing flux by several orders of magnitude , and hence the model may be quite robust in the parameter space .",
    "we find a strong apparent correlation between the inferred intrinsic spectral index and the amount of reflection and its ionization ( see fig",
    ". 2 and table 1 ) . the gas pressure at which the transition from the hot to the cold material occurs , @xmath148 , scales with the compton temperature as @xmath149 ( see eq . 4 in nayakshin 2000a ) .",
    "therefore , the cold layer lies closer to the top of the skin for larger @xmath38 for a given illuminating flux . in our numerical simulations the thomson depth of the skin changes from @xmath150 for @xmath151 to @xmath152 for @xmath153 ( see fig .",
    "the thicker the skin , the more it masks the cold material below it ( e.g. , see nkk ) , and so the correlation between @xmath38 and @xmath154 that we found in this paper is to be expected .",
    "the correlation of the inferred ionization state ( @xmath155 ) with @xmath38 comes about as a consequence of changes in @xmath18 and the actual ionization state of the skin with changes in the spectral index . in particular , when @xmath38 increases , the compton temperature , and hence the skin s temperature , decrease ( see nayakshin & kallman 2000 on this ) . for @xmath156 ,",
    "the skin is highly ionized , rather than extremely ionized , and so it produces strong features from h and he  like iron . however , its optical depth is not very large for the parameters chosen in this paper ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . hence",
    ", there is a substantial contribution to the reflected spectrum from the low to moderate ionization material under the ionized skin .",
    "the `` observed '' ionization state is a compromise between the optically thin , ionized skin and the low ionization material below , which then leads to the inferred correlation of @xmath155 and @xmath38 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that a larger thomson depth of the ionized skin leads to larger integrated x  ray albedo , @xmath157 .",
    "the thermal flux resulting from reprocessing of the incident x  ray flux is @xmath158 .",
    "thus , the thicker the ionized skin , the less reprocessed radiation will emerge , which means that compton cooling of the magnetic active regions above the disk will be reduced .",
    "this is why nayakshin ( 1999b ) and nayakshin & dove ( 2000 ) find that larger values of @xmath18 lead to hotter coronae above the disk , i.e. , smaller values of @xmath38 if the optical depth of the corona is fixed .",
    "in other words , a complete self  consistent calculation , where @xmath38 is not a fixed parameter , but it is rather found via balancing energy heating and cooling in the corona would produce _ even stronger _",
    "apparent correlation between @xmath38 and @xmath154 than the one we found here .",
    "these findings appear to be very relevant for the recently found correlations between @xmath38 and @xmath154 for a sample of agn and gbhcs , as well as for some individual sources ( e.g. , zdziarski , et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "note also that the correlation between @xmath155 and @xmath38 inferred in our models suggest that sources with steeper x  ray spectra should produce spectra that _ appear _ to be more ionized than those of sources with harder spectra .",
    "this statement is only correct in the statistical sense , though .",
    "namely , if for every @xmath38 there is a range of illumination parameters @xmath23 , then at a given @xmath23 , there will be a correlation of @xmath155 and @xmath38 similar to that shown in fig .",
    "1 . folded with a range of @xmath23 for every @xmath38 , one still expects to see a similar correlation , probably somewhat weaker than the one we found here .",
    "this theoretical expectation does indeed appear to match the behavior of the ( steep spectrum ) narrow line seyfert 1 s , which have a large amount of ionized reflection ( nls1  pounds , done & osborne 1995 ; vaughan et al .",
    "this supports the picture where the difference between nls1s and normal seyfert 1s is that nls1s accrete at a high fraction of the eddington limit ( pounds et al .",
    "1995 ) , as the steep spectrum gives a low compton temperature and so reflection from highly ionized as opposed to extremely ionized material .",
    "however , this correlation does _ not _ hold for mcg63015 , which has a steep spectrum together with a large amount of apparently _ neutral _ reflection ( lee et al 1999 ; zdziarski et al 1999 ) , although the variability of the line may indicate that ionization effects are important ( reynolds 2000 ) .",
    "clearly the models used here are incomplete .",
    "the optical depth of the ionized layer changes as a function of radius , and relativistic smearing effects should also be included .",
    "however , it is clearly necessary to develop a basic understanding of how the complex ionization models differ from simplified single zone ones for a specific radius with no relativistic effects .",
    "having understood that , one can move to the reflected spectra for complete disks , which we plan to do in future work .    based on physical intuition and some preliminary work",
    ", we can speculate on the full disk spectra .",
    "nkk and nayakshin & kallman ( 2000 ) show that if the illuminating x  ray flux , @xmath159 , exceeds that of the locally produced disk thermal emission , @xmath160 , and the x  ray spectrum is relatively hard , i.e. , @xmath161 , then the skin is nearly completely ionized . the depth of the completely ionized skin decreases with increasing radius in the disk ( see nayakshin 2000a ) .",
    "hence , larger radii contribute relatively more of the atomic features ( e.g. , k@xmath0 line and iron edges ) to the overall spectrum , while smaller radii contribute less . if @xmath162 in the inner disk then the extremely relativistic reflected signature will be absent from the data . a low ionization reflection signature is only seen from radii larger than the point at which @xmath163 .",
    "this would suppress the broadest components of the iron line , so could make the derived line profile look _ qualitatively _ like that from a truncated disk ( see fig .",
    "2b in nayakshin 2000b ) .",
    "one still hopes that detailed and direct spectral fitting , combined with future more sensitive observations , will allow us to discriminate between the physically truncated and completely ionized disks .",
    "the key element in the complex ionization models is that for hard x  ray spectra the ionization instability results in a sharp discontinuity between the extremely ionized ( invisible ) skin and the low ionization material which gives a clearly identifiable reflection signature . given further complications that can arise due to relativistic broadening in the disk , it is quite likely that the _ full _ x  ray illuminated disks have a reflected continuum which can mimic that of a truncated disk .",
    "can we then distinguish between these two models ?",
    "we have shown that there are _ observational _ tests .",
    "firstly broad bandpass , high signal  to  noise data should show the deficiencies in the pexriv model fit ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "such data currently exist only for the galactic black hole candidates , with cyg x1 having the best determined spectrum ( gierlinski et al .",
    "1997 ; di salvo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these clearly show that the reflected spectrum from single ionization state material illuminated by a comptonized continuum is insufficient to describe the observed spectral curvature .",
    "further , even in the 220 kev bandpass there is an observable difference between the single zone and complex ionization reflection models .",
    "the complex ionization disks predict the existence of a highly ionized reflected skin which contributes to the spectrum at low energies .",
    "physically , since there is no photo  absorption opacity left in the skin , photons of all energies are scattered ( reflected ) rather than being absorbed in the skin .",
    "the low ionization reflection component has negligible flux at low photon energies ( see , e.g. , basko et al . 1974 , lightman & white 1988 ) , so that spectrum from complex ionization models yields a soft excess as compared with the single ",
    "zone models , which can be modeled by a broad spectral component at low energies .",
    "an additional and significant source of the soft x ",
    "ray excess is the bremsstrahlung emission in the skin , and compton down  scattered reflected flux . according to the analytical theory of the compton  heated completely ionized skin ( krolik et al .",
    "1981 ; nayakshin 2000 ) , cooling due to bremsstrahlung emission constitutes between @xmath164 zero ( at the top of the skin ) and @xmath165 of the total cooling rate ( on the bottom ) .",
    "the characteristic temperature at which the compton  heated branch ceases to exist is of order a few hundred ev to a few kev ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , so that the soft x  ray excess will be rolling over at similar energies , consistent with our results here .    there is a considerable evidence for a similar soft excess in the galactic black hole candidates .",
    "cyg x1 plainly shows such a component in asca ( ebisawa et al . , 1996 ) and",
    "sax ( di salvo et al . , 2000 ) data , and this is probably the reason why the rxte results include a blackbody at @xmath144 kev rather than a reflected component ( dove et al 1997 ) .",
    "figure 5a shows the pca rxte data of cyg x1 ( dataset 10241 , as used by dove et al",
    ". , 1997 ) fit to a simple single zone ionization model ( @xmath166 ) , while figure 5b shows the resulting fit including soft component ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "the spectrum is much better described with the inclusion of the soft component .",
    "the resulting spectral curvature is detected at @xmath168 per cent confidence on an @xmath169 test , and these real data look remarkably like the synthesized model spectra shown in figure 4 .",
    "clearly this can be interpreted as strong evidence for the existence of complex ionization structure in the accretion disk .",
    "however , this is not unambiguous as the gbhc have other ways to produce spectral curvature since the seed photons from the disk are so close to the energy range observed .",
    "a truncated disk with hot inner flow produces a comptonized spectrum where the first few scattering orders are anisotropic , since the illuminating disk photons are anisotropic .",
    "this produces a soft excess of about 10 per cent of the isotropic spectrum , i.e. similar in size to that expected from the complex ionization reflected spectrum ( p.t .",
    ", private communication ) .",
    "additionally , the transition between the cool truncated disk and hot inner flow is unlikely to be completely sharp , and there may be a further soft component from heated disk material .",
    "these would both affect the gbhc spectra more than those from agn , so perhaps the true test of whether the disk has complex ionization structure or is truncated is whether the agn with flat spectra are significantly better fit by including a soft excess component",
    ". however , even with the agn there are ambiguities .",
    "one of the most promising models for the origin of the variability behavior of agn and gbhc has spectral evolution of the comptonized component from individual flares .",
    "this results in a time averaged spectrum which is significantly curved , similar to the curvature seen here in cyg x1 ( poutanen & fabian 1999 ) .",
    "we caution that deconvolving the reflected spectrum from more realistic , complex continuum models will have to be done before we can observationally test whether the truncated disk or complex ionization models give a better description of the data .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that reflected x  ray spectra from models which include hydrostatic balance for the illuminated gas have very different properties than single zone ionization models . in the former models , due to the thermal ionization instability , the vertical disk structure is almost discontinuous , with a dramatic transition from an extremely ionized skin on the top to a low  to  moderate ionization material below it .",
    "the reflection signature is then a composite of a power law like spectrum from the extremely ionized material , and a low  to  moderate ionization reflection siganture from the material below the skin .",
    "the constant density reflection models do not have such a discontinuous behavior . as a result , when the spectra of hydrostatic balance models are fit with simpler , single ionization zone models ( done et al .",
    "1992 ; magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) , the physical parameters of the reflector can be miscalculated by a large factor .",
    "the single zone models fit to the low  to  moderate reflection component , which is weak even with respect to the incident power law due to scattering in the ionized skin .",
    "but the ionized skin reflection can not be reproduced in the single zone models , so this power law like reflected component is misidentified with the incident power law .",
    "since the reflected fraction @xmath170 is proportional to the ratio of the inferred reflected spectrum to that of the illuminating , then this further dilutes the `` observed '' reflected fraction .",
    "this implies that the values of @xmath171 often seen in gbhc and agn may be an artifact of the constant density reflection models used , and need not necessarily mean that the cold ss disk is truncated at some distance @xmath172 .",
    "further , our results also imply that a low value of ionization parameter ( and `` neutral '' line at 6.4 kev ) , as found by the single zone ionization models , _ does not _",
    "prove that the material is actually cold .",
    "on the contrary , the upper layer of the disk may be completely ionized and obscure the cold material below .",
    "these findings are in agreement with earlier suggestions of nayakshin ( 1999b ) and ross , fabian & young ( 1999 ) .    in addition",
    ", we find an apparent correlation between the power law index @xmath38 of the x  ray continuum and the reflection fraction .",
    "this correlation is similar to the one reported by zdziarski et al . , ( 1999 ) for agn and gbhc .",
    "we produce the correlation using only the physical nature of the ionization instability for x  ray illuminated gas in hydrostatic balance .",
    "this should operate in _ all _ models where the accretion disk is illuminated by an x  ray source .",
    "in particular , other ways to produce the correlation of the amount of reflection with @xmath38 such as a moving inner disk edge ( e.g. poutanen 1998 ) or with anisotropic illumination by magnetic flares ( beloborodov 1999a , b ) will produce even stronger correlations with the inclusion of the ionization physics .",
    "the _ only _ situation where the instability is unimportant for the observed reflected spectrum is if the optical depth of the hot layer is always very much less than unity .",
    "however , one clear prediction of the ionization instability is that the steep spectrum agn should have strongly ionized reflected spectra , which does indeed seem to be the case for the narrow line seyfert 1 class of agn ( although not for the archetypal extreme relativistic disk object mcg63015 ) .",
    "thus it seems likely that the ionization instability _ is _ important in determining the observed reflected spectrum , although it may operate in conjunction with anisotropic illumination or a moving disk edge .",
    "we show that reflection from the ionized skin produces a soft x ",
    "ray continuum which can be modeled as a broad soft x ",
    "ray excess , similar to that seen in data from cyg x1 . taken together ,",
    "our findings revive models for magnetic flares above an untruncated accretion disk in agn and gbhcs which seemed to be ruled out by observations of the small solid angle of the reflector ( see , e.g. , the discussion in done &  1999 ) .",
    "it seems likely that radial gradients in the ionization structure should be able to suppress the extreme relativistic iron line profile from the inner disk , and so lead to the observed apparent truncation of the disk in the low / hard state gbhc and in some agn .",
    "however , this should be confirmed by further detailed modeling involving complete disk spectra and relativistic smearing .",
    "finally , another difficulty in unambiguously determining between complex ionization structure on a disk which extends down to the last stable orbit , and a truncated disk , is that the underlying illuminating continuum shape is not well understood .",
    "continuum curvature can mimic the `` soft excess '' signature of complex ionization structure , and is predicted in the truncated disk geometry , and by models of the variability .",
    "sadly , the observational constraints on the geometry of the accretion flow around the black hole in cyg  x1 still can not distinguish between disk / coronae and adaf models for the x  ray emission .",
    "on the other hand , new data and complete disk calculations may present better constraints , allowing these very different geometries ( and accretion theories ) to be distinguished .",
