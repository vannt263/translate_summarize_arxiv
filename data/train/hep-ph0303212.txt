    "in 1953 , at the bagnres de bigorre conference  @xcite , which roberto salmeron attended as member of the manchester group , dalitz showed the following inequality  @xcite : @xmath1 the @xmath2 in eq .",
    "[ eq : dalitz ] , partner of the @xmath3 in the celebrated puzzle , is nowadays known as @xmath4 .",
    "the hypotheses leading to eq .",
    "[ eq : dalitz ] were the existence of an isospin triplet ( @xmath5 ) and the conservation of isospin in the @xmath6 decay .",
    "none of them was founded . nevertheless , owing to the @xmath7 rule , eq .",
    "[ eq : dalitz ] survived the introduction of the gell - mann nishijima scheme  @xcite and stimulated the discovery of the @xmath8 decay mode  @xcite .",
    "more than thirty years later , the same inequality was written in a paper  @xcite devoted to the `` calculation of exclusive decay modes of the tau '' , but the @xmath6 studied in the paper was the @xmath6 lepton .",
    "this coincidence can serve to illustrate the longevity and the generality of the isospin relations .",
    "however , in the following pages , we will discuss only their applications  @xcite to the decay modes of the @xmath6 lepton .",
    "the proof of an equation like eq .",
    "[ eq : dalitz ] starts from the identification of the different possible isospin states for the hadronic system .",
    "the amplitudes for a given charge - configuration ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 for three @xmath11 s with @xmath12 ) are linear combinations of the isospin amplitudes ; thus the partial widths are linear combinations of the squared amplitudes and their interference terms .",
    "generally , a large fraction of the interference terms are killed by the integration over the phase - space .",
    "the remaining terms are bounded by the schwartz inequality  @xcite .",
    "the resulting constraints can be geometrically represented by an allowed convex domain in the space of the charge - configuration fractions , @xmath13 .",
    "if all the interferences vanish , the domain is a polyhedron , convex hull of the points that describe each isospin state .",
    "hence , the first step in the construction of the allowed domain is the setting up of a basis for the isospin states , adapted to the implementation of the pauli principle .",
    "such a basis was constructed by pais  @xcite with the object of studying the many pion systems produced in @xmath15 and @xmath16 annihilations .",
    "the construction is based on two simple remarks : _",
    "i ) _ the representations of the isospin group su(2 ) relevant for @xmath17 systems are also representations of so(3 ) , _ ii ) _ the group of @xmath18 orthogonal unimodular matrices , so(3 ) , is a subgroup of the group of @xmath18 unimodular matrices , sl(3 ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath19 is the three - dimensional space of the isospin states of one pion , the space of the states of @xmath20 pions , @xmath21 , supports representations of both sl(3 ) and the symmetric group @xmath22 , which acts on @xmath21 by permuting its factors .",
    "standard properties of the representations of linear groups  @xcite imply the decomposition @xmath23 where the symbol @xmath24 , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , is associated to a three - row young diagram ; @xmath27 is the irreducible representation of @xmath22 determined by the diagram , and @xmath28 an irreducible representation of sl(3 ) . for a given @xmath20 ,",
    "the correspondence between the representation of sl(3 ) and @xmath29 is one  one . the representation @xmath28 is characterized by the two numbers : @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "as a representation of so(3 ) , @xmath28 is no longer irreducible because of the invariance under so(3 ) of the contraction operation  @xcite .",
    "its decomposition into irreducible representations of so(3 ) reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath34-dimensional irreducible representation ( integer isospin i ) .",
    "the multiplicity @xmath35 was computed by racah  @xcite .",
    "it can be written : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the greatest integer contained in @xmath38 for @xmath39 , and @xmath40 for @xmath41 . for systems of two pions , we get :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for any @xmath29 , eq .",
    "[ eq : racah ] implies the relation @xmath42 which can also be obtained directly from the symmetry ( @xmath43 ) of a contraction .",
    "if both @xmath30 and @xmath31 are even , @xmath44 , otherwise @xmath45 .    from the equations ( [ eq : sunsp ] ) , ( [ eq : slso ] ) and ( [ eq:01 ] ) , we see that the sole degeneracy of the @xmath20-@xmath11 states @xmath46 with @xmath47 , ( @xmath48 and @xmath29 fixed ) is due to the permutation symmetry .",
    "these states form an irreducible representation of @xmath22 .",
    "since a permutation preserves the charge - configuration ( @xmath49 ) of a @xmath20-@xmath11 system , the irreducibility implies that the clebsch - like coefficients used to write the isospin states as combinations of charge - configuration states are determined by @xmath48 and @xmath29 only .",
    "in other words  @xcite , the coefficients of the charge - configurations are a class property .",
    "furthermore , since the permutation symmetry properties of the momentum and isospin amplitudes are the same , because of the pauli principle , integrating over the phase - space kills all the interference terms for a @xmath20-@xmath11 system with @xmath47 ; the allowed domain in the space of the charge - configuration fractions is a polyhedron .",
    "let s take the simple example of the @xmath12 , @xmath50 three-@xmath11 system alluded to in the introduction . for so(3 ) , an isospin one is a vector , and any vector made of three vectors can be written @xmath51    as an isospin function , @xmath52 describes an @xmath50 state with the two first @xmath11 in an @xmath53 state : @xmath54 .",
    "it is then straightforward to write the other terms by cyclic permutations and get the ratio @xmath55 the symmetry class @xmath56 , is associated to the one - dimensional space of completely symmetric states ( @xmath57 ) for which the ratio is @xmath58 ; the class @xmath59 to the two - dimensional orthogonal space ( @xmath60 ) , with @xmath61 .",
    "an example of state in the @xmath62 class is given by a @xmath63 system , which is represented by @xmath64 , where the vector product ( @xmath65 ) is interpreted as the combination of two isospins one into an isospin one .",
    "thus the charge - configuration fractions are : @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "the weights @xmath68 depend on the dynamics .",
    "in the fermi statistical model  @xcite , they are proportional to the dimension of the representation @xmath27 of the permutation group @xmath22 ; here @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath71 states are allowed , they have to share the symmetry properties of @xmath53 or @xmath50 states , so that interference terms must be taken into account .",
    "it can be checked on eq .",
    "[ eq : racah ] that , for @xmath72 , @xmath73 for all @xmath29 .",
    "thus , for @xmath72 and @xmath74 , the charge - configuration coefficients are determined by @xmath75 , @xmath48 and @xmath29 only .",
    "tables of the coefficients can be found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "they are computed by explicitly constructing tensors with the required symmetry , as in the previous example , or by more sophisticated methods  @xcite .",
    "the possible hadronic systems channels have to be treated separately because @xmath76 decay violates isospin . ] ( @xmath77 ) in the semileptonic decay @xmath78 are : @xmath17 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the properties of the charged weak current imply that the total isospin is 1 for the strangeness zero final states , and 1/2 for the others .",
    "thus the isospin of the @xmath17 system is 1 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 ; 0 or 1 for @xmath85 ; 0 , 1 or 2 for @xmath86",
    ".    for all the cases but @xmath86 the isospin amplitudes can be labelled by the symmetry class @xmath29 only and the interference terms are killed by the integration over phase - space .",
    "thus the partial width for a given charge - configuration ( @xmath87 ) can be written : @xmath88 where the coefficients @xmath89 can be found in tables  @xcite .    for positive g - parity systems ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) ,",
    "the weak current is related by an isospin rotation to the electromagnetic current , hence relations can be established between the @xmath6 partial widths and the cross sections of @xmath0 annihilations .    for @xmath86 , a more detailed analysis taking into account the interferences is needed .",
    "= 7.5 cm      for a @xmath93 system , there are two possible symmetry classes and the isospin constraint is eq .",
    "[ eq : dalitz ] .    experimentally , the ratio @xmath94 is nearly 1 because of the dominance of the @xmath63 intermediate state",
    ". a detailed analysis of the final state  @xcite , taking into account the isospin symmetry breaking caused by the difference of the @xmath95 and @xmath96 masses , predicts a ratio 0.985 , in good agreement with the measurements  @xcite .    for a @xmath97 final state , three charge - configurations and four symmetry classes",
    "are present .",
    "the production of @xmath76 contributes to the @xmath98 and @xmath99 final states .",
    "the comparison of the measured branching ratios  @xcite ( after @xmath76 subtraction ) with the allowed domain is made in fig .",
    "[ fig:5pi ] .",
    "it shows the dominance of @xmath100 , which is due to the @xmath101 intermediate state .",
    "the final states of an even number of pions are produced by the vector current , which is related by an isospin rotation to the electromagnetic current .",
    "since the isospin rotation commutes with the permutations , the relation between @xmath6 partial widths and @xmath0 cross sections  @xcite can be written for each symmetry class @xmath29 : @xmath103    = 7.5 cm    there is only one class for @xmath104 systems . for @xmath105",
    "final states the possible classes are @xmath106 and @xmath107 . since there are two charge - configurations for both @xmath6 decays and @xmath0 annihilations , the correspondence between cross sections and partial widths is very simple : @xmath108 thorough comparisons  @xcite of @xmath6-decay and @xmath0-annihilation data for the two- and four - pion channels , including the consideration of isospin symmetry breaking , have been made recently in order to improve the theoretical determination of the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath109 .",
    "they show some discrepancies between the @xmath0 and @xmath6 data , as well as between different @xmath0 experiments .",
    "four classes can contribute to the @xmath110 states production , and only three charge - configurations are possible in @xmath6 decays as well as in @xmath0 annihilations .",
    "therefore , even with complete measurements it would not be possible to predict the partial widths from the cross sections or conversely . nevertheless , with two measurements in @xmath0 annihilations ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) and in @xmath6 decays ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) , it is possible to determine the contributions of the four classes , or , at least , to check the consistency of the different measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig:6pi ] displays the allowed region in the plane of the charge - configuration fractions and the ratio @xmath115 of the measurements  @xcite , after @xmath76 subtraction ( grey area ) .",
    "the large @xmath116 ratio observed in @xmath0 annihilations implies the dominance of @xmath117 and/or @xmath118 , quantitatively shown  @xcite by the diagonal hatched region in fig .",
    "[ fig:6pi ] .",
    "the location of the intersection of the two regions corresponds to @xmath117 , in agreement with the observed  @xcite importance of the    = 7.5 cm    @xmath119 production .",
    "discrepancies appear when the total cross section for @xmath0 annihilations into @xmath110 is taken into account .",
    "it allows an estimation  @xcite of the total @xmath120 branching ratio , which together with the measured @xmath113 gives the vertical hatched band in fig .",
    "[ fig:6pi ] , clearly incompatible with the other estimations .",
    "two hypotheses can be contemplated : either the @xmath0 cross sections are overestimated by a factor of roughly four , or the @xmath0 annihilations into @xmath110 receive a large contribution from @xmath53 , @xmath121 final states . in the second hypothesis , the cross section for would be three times larger than @xmath122 .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath110 channel to the estimation of @xmath109 is small  @xcite , however the second hypothesis , if true , could have a not completely negligible impact on the estimation .      for @xmath124 , the isospin 1/2 implies the ratio @xmath125 , to be compared with the experimental value  @xcite@xmath126    for @xmath80 systems , the number of charge - configurations is greater than the number of symmetry classes .",
    "the resulting relations between branching ratios are @xmath127 for three and four hadron final states .",
    "the data for the @xmath128 final states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kpipi ] .",
    "the location of the experimental point is consistent with the observed dominance of the intermediate states @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "= 7.5 cm    in a @xmath132 system , the possible values of the @xmath132 isospin are 0 and 1 . for @xmath133",
    "the isospin of the @xmath17 system is @xmath134 ; it can be 0 , 1 or 2 for @xmath135 .",
    "both axial and vector currents contribute to the decay , leading to @xmath136 ( v ) and @xmath137 ( a ) for the g - parity of the hadronic system , and @xmath138 .",
    "since the @xmath139 quantum numbers are different for the axial and vector currents , there is no v - a interference term in the partial widths .",
    "the g - parity of a @xmath132 system is related to its isospin and orbital momentum by @xmath140 , thus for a given ( v or a ) current the values of @xmath141 associated to @xmath133 and @xmath135 are different and there is no interference term between @xmath133 and @xmath135 amplitudes .",
    "this imply  @xcite , for any charge - configuration ( @xmath87 ) of the @xmath17 system , the equality .",
    "@xmath142 from cpt invariance , @xmath143 , but the ratio @xmath144 is a free parameter depending on dynamics and the respective contributions of v and a currents  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : kkpi ] shows the agreement of the data  @xcite with eq .",
    "[ eq : kkpi ] in the case of the @xmath145 final state .",
    "the ratio @xmath146 is found equal to 1 in agreement with the observed dominance of the intermediate state @xmath129 .",
    "the isospin amplitudes for a @xmath82 final state can be labelled by @xmath147 , @xmath148 and the symmetry class @xmath29 of the @xmath17 system .",
    "if no @xmath149 amplitude is associated with @xmath29 , there is no possible interference term and the class is described by a point in the space of the charge - configuration fractions .",
    "if @xmath149 is possible , there is one interference term , but only one since @xmath150 ( section [ sec : iso ] ) , thus the class is described by a two - dimensional elliptic domain  @xcite .",
    "the allowed domain in the space of the charge - configuration fractions is the convex hull of the points and ellipses associated with the symmetry classes of the @xmath17 system .",
    "[ fig : kkpipi ] shows a projection of this multidimensional domain in the case of @xmath151 .",
    "it implies the following inequality  @xcite : @xmath152 which , together with the relation @xmath153 ( eq .  [ eq : k3pi ] ) , gives the constraint @xmath154 on topological branching ratios .",
    "isospin relations have been used in @xmath6 lepton physics for nearly twenty years .",
    "their first applications  @xcite were the estimation of @xmath6 branching ratios from @xmath0 annihilation data , the bounding of the contributions of unobserved channels , and the elucidation of the `` one prong problem ''  @xcite .    today , a large number of decay modes are tabulated  @xcite , the order of magnitude of the smallest measured branching ratios is @xmath155 , and the data from @xmath6 decays are used  @xcite to complement and correct the information given by the @xmath0 annihilations .",
    "the observed discrepancies can only be solved by experiment . however , quoting from blackett s closing remark at the bagnres conference  @xcite : `` if the history of scientific discovery is any guide , the same increase of accuracy which will serve to settle our present controversies will equally , surely , itself bring to birth new controversies by leading of some discoveries .
