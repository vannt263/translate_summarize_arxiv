    "in this letter we address , once again , the question of how the temperature ( t ) and the chemical potential , in our case isospin chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) , affect the behavior of the linear sigma model . the question is interesting , since this model , proposed by gell - mann and levy @xcite represents perhaps the most simple realization of qcd at low energies , being also renormalizable @xcite .",
    "of course , there are other low energy realization of qcd as , for example , the no - linear sigma model , and its treatment according to chiral perturbation theory @xcite .    in both approaches for the low energy realization of qcd ,",
    "the fundamental questions concern the occurrence of phase transitions , as , for example , restoration of chiral symmetry , the presence of a pion superfluid phase , etc , as well as the evolution of parameters in the model with emphasis on mesonic masses and/or couplings constants .",
    "the recent analysis in the frame of chiral perturbation theory for masses and phase transitions has been done in @xcite .",
    "the novelty of this article is the analysis of the @xmath0 role , together with t , in the context of these questions .",
    "effects of pure finite temperature have been discussed in the past many times @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite the chiral symmetry restoration at finite t and finite baryon density has been discussed .",
    "the chemical potential involved in their analysis is the baryonic chemical potential .",
    "it is well known , @xcite , that the dependence of the low energy effective lagrange parameters on t and the chemical potential is different if we consider the baryonic chemical potential or the isospin chemical potential , which is related to the existence of an asymmetric charge state of matter .",
    "the @xmath0 , as well as the temperature dependence in the linear sigma model have been discussed very recently in @xcite .",
    "now , their treatment is based on the cornwall - jackiw - tomboulis ( cjt ) , formalism , which allows them to obtain the mass evolution from certain gap equations .",
    "an analysis of finite isospin chemical potential as well as finite temperature effects has been carried on in the frame of the nambu - jona- lasinio model , @xcite , where the authors also include a discussion of the linear sigma model .",
    "it is interesting , therefore , to compare the prediction of the one loop correction , including @xmath0 and t , to the masses in the model and compare the results with the approach in @xcite .",
    "as we will see the results for the pion mass evolution coincides almost completely , been the behavior of the scalar meson sigma , however , quite different in both approaches .",
    "first , we will consider briefly the problem of chiral symmetry restoration due to the tadpoles , which in fact depends only on t at the one loop level .",
    "then , we go on into the problem of the determination of pion an sigma meson masses . the fermions , which in the model correspond to the nucleons , are quite massive and stable .",
    "in fact , regarding phase transitions only the lower mass states are relevant .",
    "the linear sigma model is defined through the following lagrangian :    @xmath1    @xmath2\\psi + \\frac{1}{2}[(\\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma)^{2}+(\\partial_{\\mu}\\boldsymbol{\\pi})^{2}]-\\frac{\\mu^{2}}{2}[\\sigma^{2}+\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{2 } ] -\\frac{\\lambda^{2}}{4}[\\sigma^{2}+\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{2}]^{2}\\ ] ]    @xmath3    notice that we have a scalar field @xmath4 and a vector of isoscalars , the pions ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "notice also that due to the presence of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking term @xmath6 , we have @xmath7 , @xmath8 . shifting the @xmath4 field as @xmath9 were @xmath10 , we have a new lagrangian given by @xmath11 :    @xmath12\\psi + \\frac{1}{2}[(\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\pi})^{2}-\\mu_{\\pi}^{2}\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^2]\\ ] ]    @xmath13-\\lambda^{2}vs(s^{2}+\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{2})-\\frac{\\lambda^{2}}{4}(s^{2}+\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{2})^{2}\\ ] ] @xmath14 @xmath15    where we have defined :    @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18    we defined the charged pions as :    @xmath19    @xmath20    the important object , in order to fix @xmath21 , as function of t , is to impose @xmath10 .",
    "this means that the sum of tadpoles must vanishes , i.e. :    @xmath22{figuras / counterterm.eps } + \\frac{1}{2 } \\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figuras / tadpolesigma.eps } + \\frac{1}{2 } \\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figuras / tadpolepio.eps } + 2 \\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figuras / tadpolefermion.eps } = 0\\ ] ]    this can be rewritten as :    @xmath23    in the previous equation , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , denote the corresponding tadpole corrections .",
    "notice that we have included symmetry factors .",
    "if we neglect the chemical potential associated to the fermions , due to their very high mass , the previous relation gives us an evolution of @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath28 fields are isoscalars , i.e. there is no isospin chemical potential associated to them .",
    "the influence of @xmath0 on the vacuum stability appears only in higher loop tadpole corrections .",
    "the thermal corrections for @xmath29 are obtained by taking the thermal part of the propagators in each tadpole .",
    "thermo field dynamics ( tfd ) is an appropriate formalism for dealing with thermal loop corrections in the real time formalism . for one loop corrections ,",
    "the matrix propagators reduce to the well known dolan - jackiw propagators .",
    "the propagator for a bosonic scalar field is given by :    @xmath30    and for a fermion field , by    @xmath31    in the previous equations , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , denote the well known bose - einstein and the fermi - dirac statistical factors , respectively .",
    "@xmath34    the most natural way to introduce a chemical potential in field theory is to consider it as a zero component of an external constant gauge field , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this way , for example for the scalar bosonic propagator we have now    @xmath35    if we take only in to account the finite thermal corrections we get    @xmath36    where ,    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    the evolution of @xmath27 is shown in fig.1.we notice that @xmath21 vanishes only if @xmath6 is absent .     field , @xmath21(t ) ]    for the numerical purposes we will use , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 .",
    "recently , @xcite , the existence of a scalar meson with @xmath44 has been established .",
    "an analytic treatment of @xmath29 is only possible in the low or high energy temperature regime . in fig.1",
    "we show the numerical results . as a consequence of the thermal tadpoles ,",
    "the tree level potential energy of the model ,    @xmath45^{2}+ \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{2}[\\sigma^{2}+\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{2 } ] -\\epsilon c\\sigma \\label{pot1}\\ ] ]    develops a non trivial temperature dependent minimum for @xmath46 .",
    "in fact we get ,    @xmath47    where @xmath27 .",
    "if we start from the nambu - goldstone phase , @xmath48 , we can see that for @xmath49 the potential has two minima as it is shown in fig.2 ,     mev ]    however , when @xmath50 the potential starts to develop only one minimum .",
    "this fact , shown in fig.3 , represents the occurrence of a phase transition from the nambu - golstone mode into de wigner mode , if we neglect the explicit chiral symmetry breaking term @xmath6 , as it is discussed in @xcite .",
    "in order to find the mass corrections for the @xmath28 we need to evaluate the diagrams shown in fig.4 ,     self energy corrections , @xmath51    whereas for the charged pions we have only the two diagrams shown in fig.5 .    , @xmath52 self energy correction , @xmath53 and @xmath54    the self energy corrections @xmath55 allow , according to the well known procedure of summing geometric series , to define a dressed mass i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath55 can be decomposed as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the thermal corrections to the self energy .",
    "@xmath59 is the zero temperature self energy and it will not be considered here , since it is absorbed according the usual renormalization procedure at zero temperature .    the self energy correction for @xmath28 does not depend on the isospin chemical potential @xmath0 , since as we said we are not considering here a @xmath0 associated to the fermions . on the contrary ,",
    "the self energy corrections to the charged pions will have now thermal and @xmath0 dependent contributions .",
    "our results are plotted in fig.6 for @xmath28 and in fig.7 for the charged pions . the chemical potential contributes , as it was expected to increase de mass for the charged pions .    .",
    "]     and @xmath60 . ]",
    "the relevant diagrams , where the @xmath4 meson is represented by the dashed line , are shown in fig.8 .    ]",
    "the results for the sigma meson mass are shown in fig.9 and fig.10 . from the technical point of view , as usual , the principal value has to be use in order to handle the poles .",
    "the growing of @xmath61 , as function of t , does not correspond to the @xmath61 evolution in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "this is due to the mean field approximation they followed .",
    "in fact , this effective approach is quite more complicated than the usual loop expansion for the masses .     in function of t. ]     in function of @xmath0 . ]    to summarize , we can see that the isospin chemical potential contribution , both for the masses as well as for the vacuum evolution is quite small compared to the temperature dependence .",
    "the pion masses at the one loop order have have a very similar behavior to the corresponding masses in the mean field approaches .",
    "however , the sigma meson mass is quite different in both approaches .",
    "the loop expansion predicts a steadily growing for the sigma meson mass as function of t with small correction due to @xmath0 .",
