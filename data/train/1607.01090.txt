    "mira variables and long period variables ( lpvs ) are low- to intermediate - mass ( @xmath9 ) asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars that pulsate with a period range of 100 @xmath10 1000 days .",
    "they are surrounded by large and extended dust and molecular shells , and in sources with mass - loss rate higher than @xmath11yr@xmath1 , we sometimes find maser emissions of h@xmath0o , sio , or oh @xcite . because of their high mass - loss rate , they are also important source to study chemical composition of the universe . another characteristic of the sources is concerned to their periodic variation .",
    "the relation between k band apparent magnitude ( @xmath5 ) and logarithm of pulsation period ( @xmath8 ) of mira variables is well known in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite .",
    "if the lmc distance is given , the relation can be converted to a relation of absolute magnitude ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath8 , then it can be used as a distance indicator . since there is a metallicity difference between lmc and our galaxy , it is also important to establish this @xmath13 relation using sources in our own galaxy .",
    "since the lpvs are very bright in infrared , we can use them to probe a region where interstellar extinction is strong such as the direction of the galactic center and galactic plane .",
    "however , a construction of the @xmath13 relation for the galactic mira variables has long been difficult because of large errors in @xmath12 due to distance uncertainty .",
    "making use of a high performance of the vera array @xcite , which is a japanese vlbi project dedicated to the galactic astrometry , we aim to construct the @xmath13 relation for galactic lpvs .",
    "r ursae majoris ( r  uma ) is an o - rich mira variable @xcite with a pulsation period of 301.6 days ( gcvs ) .",
    "the h@xmath0o masers associated with r  uma also exhibit regular periodic variation with a phase lag of @xmath30.3 with respect to the optical light curve @xcite .",
    "although the hipparcos satellite has measured the annual parallax of 2.37@xmath21.06 mas @xcite , its corresponding distance of 422@xmath14 pc still has a large error and it brings an uncertainty to the absolute magnitude . in this study , we observe this source with vera to obtain more accurate distance based on an precise astrometry of h@xmath0o maser positions .",
    "a high resolution vlbi map gives an angular distribution of maser spots around the star .",
    "then , a time series of multiple vlbi observations can add kinematic information to the masers .",
    "this helps us to understand a global picture of circumstellar medium on the schemes of time and space . in case",
    "the maser distribution is relatively isotropic like a mira variable ` t  lep ' in our previous study @xcite , a circumstellar kinematics can be derived from an analysis only using vlbi maps .",
    "the detailed procedure is given in section 3.4 in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the number of the maser spots is small or the distribution is far from isotropic , the same procedure can not offer a reliable kinematic picture of the maser spots . in this study",
    ", we propose a new method to obtain a kinematics of the circumstellar masers in r  uma .",
    "we solve the @xmath13 relation of the galactic mira variables based on the latest results from astrometric vlbi observations .",
    "infrared photometry is also used to measure an apparent magnitude in @xmath4 band .",
    "we have observed h@xmath0o maser emission at the rest frequency of 22.235080ghz ( 6@xmath15 - 5@xmath16 transition ) associated with r  uma at 24 epochs between 2006 april and 2008 july with a typical separation of 12 months using the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) .",
    "the vera consists of four antennas of 20 m aperture at mizusawa , iriki , ogasawara , and ishigaki - jima @xcite .",
    "an extra - galactic continuum source j1056@xmath177011 was also observed simultaneously with a dual - beam system equipped with the antennas @xcite to maximize on - source integration time of each source . this continuum source is used as a position reference in our phase - referencing analysis .",

    "the received source signals from two receivers were recorded using the sony dir2000 system with a recording rate of 1024 mbps in 2-bit quantization , yielding a data with its total bandwidth of 256 mhz .",
    "this total bandwidth of 256 mhz was divided into 16 if channels of 16 mhz bandwidth .",
    "one if channel was assigned for the maser emission from r  uma , while the other 15 if channels were assigned for continuum emission from the reference source j1056@xmath177011 .",

    "i d 24 ) , a broader frequency spacing of 31.25 khz corresponding to a velocity spacing of 0.4216 kms@xmath1 was adopted .",
    "for the data of reference source j1056@xmath177011 , each if channel data were divided into 64 spectral channels .",
    "the synthesized beam size was typically 1.2mas@xmath200.8mas with its major axis position angle of 155@xmath18 .",
    "calibration and imaging were performed using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software package .",
    "we performed an amplitude calibration using @xmath19 .",
    "bright continuum sources 3c273b and 4c39.25 were used in a bandpass calibration of the receiver of r  uma , while a position reference source j1056@xmath177011 was used in the calibration for the other receiver .",
    "we used a task fring to solve residual phase fluctuations of the reference source j1056@xmath177011 , and a task calib was also used to solve shorter phase fluctuation .",
    "then , the solutions of phase , rate and amplitude were applied to the data of r  uma . the instrumental phase difference between the two receivers , which was measured during each observation using the correlated data of noise signal injected into the two receivers from artificial noise sources installed on a feedome base of the vera antenna @xcite ,",
    "was also applied in the reduction process . since the @xmath21 delay tracking model used in the mitaka correlator was not accurate enough for precise astrometry , we calibrated them based on more accurate delay tracking model .",

    "if we can directly detect a central star with our vlbi method , it is easy to know internal motions of maser spots with respect to the central star .",
    "but it is difficult , and we have to introduce some reasonable assumption in order to estimate internal motions of the maser spots .",
    "for example , an isotropy of circumstellar kinematics was assumed in our previous study @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we try to reveal the internal motions of the maser spots with a method using an astrometric measurement from hipparcos satellite  @xcite .",
    "proper motions of each maser spot measured in our vlbi observations ( @xmath28@xmath29 ) involve various kinematics , such as the galactic rotation , a systemic motion of the star , and their internal motions .",
    "a proper motion of r  uma measured by hipparcos ( @xmath28@xmath30 ) also include the same kinematics as @xmath28@xmath29 except for internal motions of the maser spots .",
    "therefore , a remainder of two measurements ( @xmath28@xmath29 @xmath10 @xmath28@xmath30 ) should give internal motions of the maser spots on the rest frame fixed to the central star .",
    "in the revised hipparcos catalog  @xcite , the proper motion of r  uma is reported to be @xmath28@xmath30 @xmath31 masyr@xmath1 .",
    "for maser spots detected more than two continuous epochs , we estimated their proper motions .",
    "since the parallax of 1.97 mas determined in section  [ sec_parallax ] is the same for all maser spots , we used the fixed parallax and re - fitted all the individual maser spots solving only for internal motion . by subtracting the @xmath28@xmath30 from the proper motions of each maser spot",
    ", we obtained internal motions @xmath32 and @xmath33 for 38 out of all 72 maser spots , and presented them in table  [ maser_table ] in unit of masyr@xmath1 .",
    "we also presented errors of the internal motions @xmath34 and @xmath35 on the table which are quadratic sums of two errors from hipparcos catalog and our vlbi observation .",
    "since measurement accuracy of proper motions in our vlbi observation is , on average , 0.2masyr@xmath1 , resultant errors are almost dominated by the error from hipparcos measurement .",
    "a proper motion of r  uma system can also be estimated from our vlbi observations .",
    "we averaged out all the proper motions of maser spots and obtain a motion of @xmath36 masyr@xmath1 and @xmath37 masyr@xmath1 in ra and dec , respectively . in the ra , two proper motions from hipparcos and vera are consistent within their errors .",
    "in the dec , however , there is a difference of @xmath32 masyr@xmath1 between two measurements .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_internalmotion ] , we found unisotropic distribution of maser spots .",
    "we think the systemic motion derived from vera possibly be biased due to this unisotropy .",
    "therefore , in this section , we used the proper motion in hipparcos catalog to inspect internal motions of the maser spots .    in figure  [ fig_internalmotion ] , internal motions of maser spots on sky plane",
    "are indicated with arrows .",
    "proper motion of 1 masyr@xmath1 corresponds to a transverse velocity of 2.41 kms@xmath1 at the source distance of 508 pc .",
    "an arrow at bottom right shows a proper motion of 3 masyr@xmath1 ( @xmath38 7.22kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "average errors of internal motions are 0.90 masyr@xmath1 and 0.88 masyr@xmath1 in ra and dec , respectively .",
    "most @xmath33 show essentially larger velocities than their errors @xmath35 , and therefore , we think our analysis gives an reliable picture of the internal motions especially along dec axis .",
    "maser spots at the southern area of the map show southward motions , and on the contrary , two spots at the northern area show northward motions . with regards to the ra axis ,",
    "@xmath32 values are same as their errors , and this brings a large uncertainty to directions about the internal motions along ra axis .",
    "nevertheless , we can conclude that there is no remarkable systemic motion along ra axis enough to be detected with this method . as a result",
    ", our analysis of internal motion revealed an outward motions with respect to the central region of the map .",
    "a root sum square of internal motions along two axes @xmath39 gives a transverse velocities on the skyplane .",
    "an average of the transverse velocities was obtained to be 6.61 kms@xmath1 . in the next section",
    ", we will give a more detailed study to capture a global picture of the maser spots and the central star .",
    "finally in this subsection , we mention a binarity of the r  uma system .",
    "there are some agb samples known as a binary stars , i.e. , mira ab system @xcite , r  aqr @xcite , and so on .",
    "the r  uma is one of possible samples of binary system .",
    "@xcite studied fluxes of some agb stars at near - uv , far - uv , optical , and near - ir bands .",
    "they concluded that the far - uv excess likely results either directly from the presence of a hot binary companion or indirectly from a hot accretion disk around the companion .",
    "if the r  uma forms a binary system and the binarity affects internal motions of maser spots , astrometric measurements of the maser spots include the binary motion .",
    "then , a remainder @xmath28@xmath29 @xmath10 @xmath28@xmath30 still have some contribution from the binary motion .",
    "however , as presented above , we could not detect any systematic motion for all maser spots but detected expanding like motions .",
    "this can implies that there is no large binary effect that seriously disturb our consideration of internal motion .",
    "therefore , we have not considered the binarity in this section .      based on the distribution and internal motions of the maser spots revealed in previous sections",
    ", we will discuss the position of the central star .",
    "now we focus on the motions of the maser spots along dec axis . in figure",
    "[ fig_yvsvy ] , we show a relation between @xmath33 and @xmath40 of 38 maser spots . since there seems to be a gradient of @xmath33 , we fitted this data to a linear function .",
    "then we obtained a relation of @xmath41 , which is presented with a solid line in figure  [ fig_yvsvy ] .",
    "for @xmath42 , this relation gives a @xmath43 , and this @xmath40 value can be considered as a possible @xmath40 position of the central star . in figure",
    "[ fig_internalmotion ] , this @xmath40 value is presented with a solid horizontal line with peripheral region ( gray colored ) indicating its error . along the ra axis , it is difficult to find a gradient , we could not conduct the same analysis as the dec axis .    independently",
    ", we tried to estimate a stellar position using the angular distribution of maser spots . a cross on the map indicates an estimated stellar position of @xmath44 mas which was obtained by simply calculating medians of two ends in ra and dec axes .",
    "assuming this position , we calculated angular distances @xmath45 of the maser spots from the central star . here , we introduce a simple uniform expanding shell model @xcite of @xmath46 where @xmath45 is an angular distance from the central star , @xmath47 is the shell radius , @xmath48 is the radial velocity of the star , and @xmath49 is an expansion velocity of the shell .",
    "figure  [ fig_pv ] shows a @xmath45 vs @xmath50 diagram of the 38 maser spots .",
    "a shape of the model on this figure shows an ellipse .",
    "we assumed a @xmath48 of 40.49 kms@xmath1 which is obtained as a center of @xmath51 values of maser spots .",
    "since a distribution of the data on the @xmath52 plane is too narrow to numerically solve suitable @xmath49 and @xmath47 , we assumed a @xmath49 to be 6.6 kms@xmath1 which is an average of transverse velocities of the maser spots obtained in previous section . using all maser spots",
    ", we solved a @xmath47 to be 85@xmath22 mas , which is presented with solid line in figure  [ fig_pv ] . for comparison ,",
    "we also presented two models whose outer radius of 120 mas ( dashed  line ) and an inner radius of 65 mas ( one  dotted chain line ) .",
    "latter two models are not obtained from numerical fitting but we assumed fixed radii . in figure  [ fig_internalmotion ] , the shell model with a radius of @xmath53 85 mas is presented as a dotted circle whose center is assumed to be the cross symbol .       and @xmath54 of the maser spots .",
    "a solid ellipse indicates an uniform shell model with a radius of 85 mas obtained from a numerical fitting .",
    "dashed and one - dotted - chain lines indicate models with shell radii of 120 and 65 mas , respectively .",
    "expansion velocities of @xmath55 6.6 kms@xmath1 are fixed for all models .",
    ", width=321 ]    by revealing accurate motion of circumstellar matter , properties of stellar wind will be inspected and it helps us to understand mass - loss process .",
    "however , the distributions of circumstellar matter sometimes show symmetry , and sometimes show asymmetry . a conventional method for determining the circumstellar motion based on the vlbi data , which assumes uniformity or symmetry for circumstellar matters ,",
    "intrinsically has limitation to derive the real picture .",
    "therefore , it is important to create different method which does not need any assumption about symmetry or uniformity for circumstellar matter . a capability of the new method , which combines vlbi and other independent astrometric data , was presented here .",
    "to acquire more accurate picture of internal motions using the same method , accurate systemic motions of stars are required .",
    "the gaia satellite   , launched in 2013 , is an ongoing astrometric program which expected to measure accurate proper motions for large amount of stars .",
    "for very bright stars , like nearby mira variables , a japanese satellite nano ",
    "jasmine   will also be a powerful and promising telescope to determine their proper motions . in near future ,",
    "more accurate proper motions of stars measured by new satellites will be tied up with vlbi measurements of maser spots , and circumstellar dynamics of many sources can be studied with the same method in this study .",

    "sequences c and c in their classification correspond to groups of variables pulsating in a fundamental tone and a first - overtone , respectively .",
    "since distances of the galactic sources can not be treated as identical like sources in the lmc , the same relation should be studied in @xmath56log@xmath24 plane , where @xmath12 is a @xmath4 band absolute magnitude . in this section ,",
    "we confirm a location of r  uma on the @xmath56log@xmath24 plane , and solve a zero - point of the galactic @xmath56log@xmath24 relation based on recent astrometric results .    during the last decade",

    "the error is determined as a root mean square of distance based error and apparent magnitude error . adding this new source",
    ", we summarized the sources in table  [ parallax_table ] in an increasing order of pulsation period together with all galactic lpvs whose distances are determined with astrometric vlbi .",

    "<S> we have measured an annual parallax of the mira variable r  ursae  majoris ( r  uma ) with the vlbi exploration for radio astronomy ( vera ) . from the monitoring vlbi observations spanning about two years , we detected h@xmath0o maser spots in the lsr velocities ranges from 37 to 42 kms@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we derived an annual parallax of 1.97@xmath20.05mas , and it gives a corresponding distance of 508@xmath213pc . </S>",
    "<S> the vlbi maps revealed 72 maser spots distributed in @xmath3110 au area around an expected stellar position . </S>",
    "<S> circumstellar kinematics of the maser spots were also revealed by subtracting a systemic motion in the hipparcos catalog from proper motions of each maser spots derived from our vlbi observations . </S>",
    "<S> infrared photometry is also conducted to measure a @xmath4 band apparent magnitude , and we obtained a mean magnitude of @xmath5 = 1.19@xmath20.02mag . using the trigonometric distance , the @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> is converted to a @xmath4 band absolute magnitude of @xmath67.34@xmath20.06mag . </S>",
    "<S> this result gives a much more accurate absolute magnitude of r  uma than previously provided . </S>",
    "<S> we solved a zero - point of @xmath7 relation for the galactic mira variables and obtained a relation of @xmath63.52 @xmath8 + ( 1.09 @xmath2 0.14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> other long period variables including red supergiants , whose distances were determined from astrometric vlbi , were also compiled to explore the different sequences of @xmath7 relation . </S>"
