    "transition distribution amplitudes ( tda ) were firstly introduced in ref . @xcite as objects parametrizing soft part of the amplitudes for hadron - antihadron annihilation @xmath0 or backward compton scattering @xmath1 , where the hard scale is provided by high virtuality of one of the photons . in some sense tda s are hybrids of the ordinary distribution amplitudes ( da ) and generalized parton distributions ( gpd ) ( see @xcite for a review ) . however",
    ", if one restricts oneself to the mesonic case , they are more similar to gpd s - the difference is that we deal with matrix elements which are non - diagonal not only in momenta but in the physical states as well . nevertheless , from kinematical point of view , both are almost identical and therefore we can use similar variables as skewedness for example . in practice",
    "we consider two kinds of tda s : vector and axial , depending on nature of the bilocal quark - antiquark operator sandwiched between photon and meson states",
    ". for experimental issues of transition distribution amplitudes see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to avoid complexity of bound state physics",
    "we limit ourselves to pions only .",
    "pions are goldstone bosons of broken su(2 ) chiral symmetry and their properties are to large extent determined by the symmetry ( breaking ) alone rather than by the complex phenomenon of confinement .",
    "after such simplification , we can use the non - local semi - bosonized nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model to get an insight into tda s . on the other hand , since transition distribution amplitudes are related to anomalous diagrams , they can serve as a demanding tester of the non - local models .",
    "we shall come back to this point later in this paper .",
    "first estimates of tda s were made in refs . @xcite .",
    "the first one @xcite was based on general qcd symmetries supported by simple quark model , while the second @xcite and the third one @xcite made use of spectral quark model ( sqm ) @xcite and pauli - villars regulated njl , respectively .",
    "the calculations in sqm respect all qcd symmetries by definition ( i.e. lorentz invariance , ward identities , anomalies etc . ) . in pauli - villars regulated njl model the presence of the finite regulator @xcite gives normalization for the vector amplitude which is not consistent with axial anomaly .",
    "in @xcite we calculated tda s numerically in the non - local chiral quark model , however , since we have used `` naive '' currents we also broke the normalization condition of vector tda .",
    "in the present paper we extend our calculations from ref .",
    "@xcite in twofold way : we use the full non - local vertices and obtain not only numerical but also analytical results for some of the tda s . as a result",
    "we recover correct normalization conditions fixed by axial anomaly and give predictions for axial form factor which is not restricted by anomaly .",
    "our results are here in qualitative agreement with experimental data . since we revised our old calculations using different method we traced the mistake in the vector amplitude , which however does not change qualitative results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we review the non - local chiral quark model and give the prescription for modified currents .",
    "next , in section [ sec : definitions ] , we recall the definitions of tda s and relevant sum rules .",
    "section [ sec : results ] contains our results with special emphasis on the role of the new pieces coming from the non - local parts of the currents . in section [ sec : formfactors ] we investigate the relevant form factors and finally we summarize our results in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "technical details are given in the appendices .",
    "in the following we use the non - local semi - bosonized namu - jona - lasinio model .",
    "it is based on the quark - pion interaction in the following form @xcite@xmath2 where @xmath3 is dynamical quark mass appearing due to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "meson field @xmath4 is given in terms of the pion field as@xmath5 where @xmath6 is the pion decay constant .",
    "one defines mass dependence on momentum as@xmath7 where form factor @xmath8 should vanish for @xmath9 and is chosen to satisfy @xmath10 .",
    "expression for @xmath11 was obtained analytically in euclidean space from the instanton model of the qcd vacuum and it is highly non trivial @xcite .",
    "therefore here we use the minkowski form proposed in @xcite @xmath12 which reproduces reasonably well the instanton result when continued to euclidean space .",
    "however , it can be also used directly in the minkowski space .",
    "integer parameter @xmath13 defines a family of models and allows to analyze a dependence of our results on the shape of @xmath8 .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath8 should vanish exponentially for large momenta in order to be consistent with ope .",
    "this is another reason for introducing @xmath13 parameter , which allows to control high momentum behavior .",
    "the method of fixing value of @xmath14 is described below .    it is a",
    "well known fact that due to the mass dependence on momentum the standard vector and axial currents are not conserved and ward - takahashi ( wt ) identities are not satisfied .",
    "although it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that this violation is not very large and almost does not affect shapes of tda s , it certainly affects overall normalizations .",
    "it is therefore necessary to resolve the problem of normalization if one wants to use tda s calculated in the non - local model for phenomenological estimates .",
    "there are several ways of constructing conserved currents in presence of non - local interactions see refs .",
    "however , it should be recalled at this point that none of them is unique , because current conservation fixes only the longitudinal part of a given vertex while the transverse one has to be modeled . in this paper",
    "we use the simplest minimal  vertices satisfying wt identities . for vector",
    "current @xmath15 we replace @xmath16 by the following non - local vertex@xmath17 where the non - local addition reads@xmath18 this form of non - locality does not introduce singularities as required by general prosperities of vector vertices @xcite .",
    "axial current @xmath19 is made conserved by replacing @xmath20 by@xmath21 with@xmath22 in contrary to the vector vertex , the axial one contains physical singularity corresponding to the pion .    for a model given by @xmath13",

    "can be calculated analytically - see the appendix of @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : model_param ] we present @xmath14 for given values of constituent quark mass @xmath25 and power @xmath13 .",
    "let us recall at this point that there exists another expressions for @xmath23 , namely the pagels - stokar formula @xcite . as shown explicitly in _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite it accommodates a non - local pion - quark interaction , however it corresponds to the naive axial current @xmath26 which , as mentioned above , does not exhibit pcac . on the contrary the birse - bowler formula @xcite takes into account the non - local axial current ( more precisely its derivative , which is determined unambiguously ) .",
    "@xcite for discussion .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath14 _ does not correspond _ to the qcd scale characteristic for the present model .",
    "indeed function @xmath27 does not change much for different @xmath28 except for the high momentum part .",
    "therefore , as pointed out in @xcite , the precise definition of the scale can be done only within qcd , while within an effective model one can only estimate the order of magnitude . for the instanton model",

    "our approach follows closely the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite with one important modification . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have used the momentum dependent constituent quark mass and the nonlocal pion - quark interaction , however , both vector and axial currents were not modified to satisfy ward - takahashi identities .",
    "we have argued in @xcite that such an approach  although inconsistent  gives reasonable shape for the tda s missing , however , normalization .",
    "indeed , our present findings confirm this conclusion .    in order to satisfy wt identities",
    "the `` naive '' qcd currents require modifications if the quark mass depends on momentum .",
    "such modifications are not unique because wt identities do not fix the longitudinal part of the current . in the present paper",
    "we have used the simplest possible modifications of the vector and axial currents given by eqs.([eq : vector_vertex ] ) and ( [ eq : axial_vertex ] ) .",
    "more importantly , we have used the nonlocal vertex not only for the photon coupling to the quark loop but also for the vector operator defining the tda .",
    "this modification is not obvious for the following reason .",
    "factorization of the physical process into hard and soft parts is done in qcd in terms of the operator product expansion and the relevant operators entering the definition of the soft part are therefore indeed the `` naive '' qcd operators . in our language",
    "this would correspond to neglecting @xmath108 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : v4 ] ) .",
    "we have checked that this would lead to the violation of the normalization condition for vtda . in the case of atda",
    "the non - local part of the axial current does not contribute , since it enters the piece proportional to the pion da ",
    "see eq.([eq : defatda ] )  but not the atda itself .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows . the normalization of tda s in the vector channel  which is fixed by the axial anomaly  turns out to be correctly reproduced in our approach . at the same time",
    "normalization of atda s is lowered due to the non - local term in the vector current . as a result",
    "the two normalizations are no longer equal , as observed experimentally .",
    "the shapes of the tda s are similar to the ones obtained in the local model and in the non - local model with naive currents . in the case of vtda s",
    "we observe , however , small difference between distributions with positive and negative @xmath109 what was previously not the case .",
    "atda s acquire negative contribution from the non - local piece which makes the differences between positive and negative @xmath109 s even more profound than in the previously considered models .",
    "we have also investigated dependence of tda s on the choice of constituent quark mass @xmath25 and the shape of the cutoff function @xmath27 .",
    "dependence on the power @xmath13 entering @xmath27 is rather weak , whereas the dependence on @xmath25 is effectively important only for atda for negative @xmath109 .",
    "we have also calculated the corresponding form factors .",
    "axial form factor is quite robust with respect to the shape of the mass dependence on momentum .",
    "pion - to - photon transition form factor , which is directly related to the vector form factor , can be compared with experimental data .",
    "we compare it with cello , cleo and recent babar data in low energy regime in fig.([fig : ffactor ] ) and conclude that our results reproduce quite well its @xmath96 dependence .",
    "let us finish by a remark that we have worked in the chiral limit where @xmath110 .",
    "the effects of adding small current masses are expected to be small , however , only further study can show whether they will be able to correct small deviations from experimental values of @xmath111 .",
    "finally the modifications of the nonlocalities that are still possible as far as longitudinal part of the currents is concerned deserve further investigation .",
    "the authors are grateful to w. broniowski , e. ruiz arriola and a. dorokhov for discussions .",
    "the paper was partially supported by the polish - german cooperation agreement between polish academy of science and dfg .",

    "we recall that @xmath114 . for",
    "the inverse scalar propagators we use@xmath115    let us now turn to vtda .",

    "<S> we find that due to the non - locality in the vector current , the value of axial form factor at zero momentum transfer is lowered with respect to the vector form factor . </S>",
