    "to study hadrons as impurity particles in nuclear medium is an important subject to investigate ( i ) the hadron - nucleon interaction , ( ii ) the change of nuclear medium by the impurity effect and ( iii ) the change of hadron properties from qcd vacuum to finite density .",
    "there have been many studies for light flavor hadrons up to strangeness  @xcite . now",
    "the heavy flavor hadrons , i.e. charm and bottom , are investigated for future experiments at gsi - fair , j - parc and so on  @xcite .",

    "kondo effect _ induced by @xmath2 mesons in nuclear mater .",
    "the kondo effect is the phenomena that the resistance of electrons in metals becomes enhanced at low temperature when there exist impurity atoms with finite spin  @xcite .",
    "this is explained by ( i ) existence of degenerate state ( fermi surface ) , ( ii ) quantum effects and ( iii ) non - abelian interaction , i.e. spin - exchange interaction , between the electron and the impurity atom , as long as the impurity is sufficiently heavy in mass , as discovered by kondo  @xcite . due to the universality of the kondo effect",
    ", it is widely discussed not only in condensed matter but also in artificial materials and recently in nuclear and quark matter at extremely high density  @xcite .    _ anticharm - strangeness _ ( @xmath5 ) mesons , i.e. @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath7 ) mesons with quark content @xmath5 , are particularly interesting to study the kondo effect in nuclear matter . due to spin 1 of the @xmath1 meson ,",
    "the spin - exchange interaction between the @xmath1 meson and the nucleon provides the non - abelian ( spin - exchange ) interaction relevant to the kondo effect .",
    "the @xmath0 meson can also play the role in the spin - exchange interaction through the process @xmath8 for the nucleon @xmath9 , although there is no direct spin - exchange between the @xmath0 meson and the nucleon .",
    "because charm quark mass is much larger than the low - energy scale of the qcd , a few hundred mev , we may regard approximately the charm quark mass infinitely large . then , we can adopt the heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) as the fundamental spin symmetry based on qcd in the heavy quark mass limit  @xcite . in terms of hqs , in fact , @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons are considered to be the hqs partners .",
    "therefore , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons should be included simultaneously as the dynamical degrees of freedom , leading to the mixing of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in nuclear matter . in this case , both of them contribute to the kondo effect .",
    "the hqs must be better for antibottom - strange mesons , i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) mesons .",
    "we denote @xmath0 or @xmath1 by @xmath13 for a short notation . in literature , there are many applications of the heavy quark symmetry to the anticharm(antibottom)-light flavor mesons in nuclear systems  @xcite ( see also references in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there are remarkable properties of @xmath13 mesons , which are similar to or different from @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath7 ) mesons with isospin 1/2 .    1 .",
    "there is no short - distance repulsion from the quark exchange in the interaction between a @xmath13 meson and a nucleon .",
    "this is in contrast to the interaction between a @xmath17 meson and a nucleon  @xcite .",
    "hence the @xmath1 meson can access the deep inside of nuclear medium as @xmath18 in nuclear matter does  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 meson has an electric charge @xmath19 , hence it can be bound in atomic nuclei especially with large baryon numbers ( e.g. @xmath20pb ) thanks to the attraction from the coulomb force even when the strong interaction is attractive only weakly .",
    "the bound state may exist even for repulsion , if it is sufficiently weak .",
    "this is known also for the @xmath21 meson in atomic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "3 .   the @xmath1 and @xmath16 mesons can be regarded as a quasi - stable state in strong interaction in vacuum .",
    "although both of them can decay to a @xmath0 or @xmath14 meson via a pion emission , the decay width is very small due to the close thresholds  @xcite .",
    "4 .   there is no isospin effect for the @xmath13 meson due to isospin 0 .",
    "this is complementary to the case of the @xmath17 meson with isospin @xmath22 , where both isospin - independent interaction and isospin - dependent interaction contribute simultaneously .    by using these similarities and differences of @xmath13 and @xmath17 mesons",
    ", we can study the properties the kondo effect for the @xmath2 mesons in nuclear matter in multiple perspectives .",
    "for example , it was shown that the kondo effect induced by the isospin - exchange interaction for the @xmath13 meson and the nucleon can exist in nuclear matter and in atomic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this is complementary to the kondo effect induced by the spin - exchange interaction .",
    "we may consider the charge - conjugate state @xmath23 and @xmath24 mesons as well . in this case , however , we have to consider additional channels such as @xmath25 , which should be covered elsewhere .",
    "the difference of the properties between the @xmath13 ( @xmath17 ) meson and the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) meson arises essentially from the breaking of charge conjugation at finite baryon number density .",
    "the study of @xmath23 and @xmath24 mesons is not covered in the present study .",

    "[ sec : kondo_scale ] , adopting the perturbative approach , we present that the effective interaction between a @xmath13 meson and a nucleon in nuclear matter becomes enhanced at the low - energy scale in infrared region , whose scale of singularity is given by the kondo scale .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : mean_field ] , we proceed to investigate the physical meaning of the kondo scale beyond the perturbation .",
    "we consider the mean - field approximation and show that the kondo scale is in fact related to the mixing strength between the @xmath13 meson and the nucleon , leading to the non - trivial behavior of the spectral function of the impurity particle in nuclear matter .",
    "we find that hqs plays the significantly important role to realize the kondo effect as the result of the mixing of the @xmath0 meson and the @xmath1 meson in nuclear matter .",

    "we rewrite @xmath48 in the rest frame @xmath49 as @xmath50 with the pauli matrices @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) for spin .",

    "the light - quark spin is decoupled from the heavy - quark spin in hqs , because the heavy - quark spin is independent of the interaction in the heavy quark limit  @xcite .",

    "the former and the latter modes correspond to the broad resonance and the delta - like peak , respectively . in case ( ii ) , the peak positions become split as the hqs breaking is added perturbatively . in case ( iii ) , it is reasonable that there is one state at @xmath181 and three states at @xmath178 , whose energy positions are in correspondence to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson masses .",

    "this results suggests that the realization of the overlapping between the energy position of the @xmath1 meson and the fermi surface is energetically most favored for the ground state . in the mean - field approach , therefore , the energy position of the @xmath1 meson is chosen automatically to minimize the total energy of the system with the kondo effect .",
    "this is consistent with the discussion in the perturbative approach .",
    "finally , we compare the present result with the  triplet - singlet kondo effect \" in the condensed matter physics , which can be realized in quantum dot systems  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the spin - triplet impurities in metal induces no kondo effect , namely no enhancement of the effective coupling at the low - energy scattering , when higher order loops are included in the renormalization group equation ( the  underscreening \" effect )  @xcite .",
    "however , the situation is different when the spin - singlet impurity exists in the energy region near the spin - triplet impurity . in this case , the kondo effect is induced by the mixing between the spin - triplet and spin - singlet impurities  @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to the kondo effect for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons in nuclear matter in the present study . in our case , the @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) meson",
    "is assigned to the spin - triplet ( spin - singlet ) impurity . as a starting point , we have considered the mixing between the @xmath1 meson and the @xmath0 meson as a natural result of introducing hqs in eq .",

    "we discuss the @xmath13 meson in nuclear matter . considering the spin - exchange interaction between the @xmath13 meson and the nucleon , we find that the effective coupling constant becomes logarithmically enhanced due to the kondo effect at the low - energy scattering for @xmath59 , whose scale of singularity is given by the kondo scale .",
    "for @xmath60 , in contrast , the mixing between the @xmath1 meson and the @xmath0 vanishes in the low - energy scattering , and the @xmath1 meson remains as a stable state in nuclear matter . as for the enhanced effective coupling for @xmath59 , we furthermore analyze the ground state in the mean - field approach , and find that the kondo scale is related to the mixing strength between the @xmath13 meson and the nucleon , leading to the non - trivial behaviors of the spectral function of the impurity .",
    "the spectral function of the impurity is the important information for experimental research of the kondo effect of the @xmath13 meson in nuclear matter .",
    "the present result can be straightforwardly applied to the @xmath201 meson .",
    "we have considered either proton or neutron as the nucleon isospin .",
    "when we consider both proton and neutron simultaneously , we will find easily that the coherent state as a sum of the proton and the neutron contributes to the coupling to the @xmath13 meson , and the other combination orthogonal to the coherent state remains as a free state with no coupling to the @xmath13 meson .",
    "the spectral function of the @xmath13 meson is the same .",
    "there are several unsolved problems . in the present analysis , we consider only @xmath53 interaction and neglected @xmath202 ( @xmath203 ) , because the latter channel is not directly related to the kondo effect .",
    "however , for more precise study , considering the latter channel must be important .",
    "for example , it is known that there can exist a strong interaction in the @xmath204-@xmath205-@xmath206 channel so that the resonant state is formed at mass position about 2780 mev  @xcite , corresponding to the exotic @xmath207 state discussed in the quark model  @xcite .",
    "application of the kondo effect to other heavy - light mesons such as @xmath17 mesons as well as @xmath23 and @xmath24 mesons @xcite will be an important subject",
    ". the competition or cooperation between the isospin - exchange interaction and the spin - exchange interaction will be interesting .",
    "studying the chiral partners is important also . particularly , chiral partners of the @xmath13 meson , the @xmath208 @xmath209 meson and the @xmath210 @xmath211 meson , are quasi - stable states with small decay widths , and hence they will be useful for investigating the partial restoration of the broken chiral symmetry in medium  @xcite .",
    "heavy - light - light ( @xmath212 ) baryons  @xcite and heavy - heavy - light ( @xmath213 ) baryons as well as heavy - heavy meson ( @xmath214 ) are also interesting objects to be investigated for the kondo effect .",
    "those subjects are left for future works .",
