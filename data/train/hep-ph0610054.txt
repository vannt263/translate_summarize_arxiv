    "supersymmetry provides an elegant solution to the gauge hierarchy problem , and grand unified theories ( guts ) gives us a simple understanding of the quantum numbers of the standard model ( sm ) fermions . in particular , the success of gauge coupling unification in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) strongly supports the possibility of the supersymmetric guts  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the electroweak gauge symmetry can be broken by the radiative corrections due to the large top quark yukawa coupling  @xcite , and the tiny neutrino masses can be generated naturally via the see - saw mechanism .",
    "therefore , supersymmetric guts may describe all the known fundamental interactions in nature except gravity .",
    "the interesting question is whether we can test supersymmetric guts at future colliders and experiments .",
    "the major prediction of supersymmetric guts is the dimension-5 proton decay from the colored higgsino exchange  @xcite .",
    "this kind of proton decay is suppressed due to the yukawa couplings .",
    "however , we can introduce the non - renormalizable operators to mimic such proton decay , _",
    "i.  e. _ , generic dimensional-5 proton decay opertors with planck scale suppression and without yukawa coupling suppression  @xcite .",
    "so , even if we observe such proton decay at future experiments , we can not confirm the possibility of supersymmetric guts .",
    "if string theory is correct , it seems to us that one new clue is the little hierarchy between the gut scale @xmath1 and the string scale @xmath2 .",
    "it is well - know that the gauge coupling unification scale in the mssm , which is called the gut scale in the literature , is around @xmath3 gev  @xcite .",
    "the gauge coupling unification in the mssm is based on two implicit assumptions : ( 1 ) the @xmath4 normalization is canonical ; ( 2 ) there are no intermediate - scale threshold corrections . on the other hand ,",
    "the string scale @xmath2 in the weakly coupled heterotic string theory is  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the string coupling constant .",
    "note that since @xmath7 , we have @xmath8 thus , there exists a factor of approximately 20 to 25 between the mssm unification scale and the string scale ( in the strong coupled heterotic string theory or m - theory on @xmath9  @xcite , the eleven - dimensional planck scale can be the mssm unification scale due to the large eleventh dimension  @xcite .",
    "but in this paper we concentrate on the weakly coupled heterotic string theory . ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the scales @xmath1 and @xmath2 implies that the weakly coupled heterotic string theory naively predicts wrong values for the electroweak mixing angle ( @xmath10 ) and strong coupling ( @xmath11 ) at the weak scale . because the weakly coupled heterotic string theory is one of the leading candidates for a unified theory of the fundamental particles and interactions in the nature , how to achieve the string - scale gauge coupling unification is an important question in string phenomenology  @xcite .    in general , we can always achieve the string - scale gauge coupling unification by introducing additional vector - like particles with arbitrary masses or arbitrary sm quantum numbers .",
    "therefore , in order to have interesting and natural models , we make the following three requirements for the additional vector - like particles : + ( 1 ) all the vector - like particles are standard .",
    "we define the standard particles as the particles that can decay into the mssm particles via yukawa couplings .",
    "so , the extra vector - like particles are not stable , and then there are no strong cosmological constraints on them . + ( 2 ) all the vector - like particles must form the complete gut multiplets .",
    "so , we do not need to split the multiplets , which is a generic problem in the guts .",
    "+ ( 3 ) all the vector - like particles must have masses around the tev scale or close to the string scale , and the string - scale threshold corrections can not be very large which is unnatural .",
    "so , the tev - scale vector - like particles can be produced and tested at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and the superheavy vector - like particles can be considered as the string - scale threshold corrections . also , there are no intermediate - scale threshold corrections .",
    "+ from requirement ( 2 ) , we can not achieve the string - scale gauge coupling unification in all the guts with simple gut groups , for example , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "also , in the mssm or standard - like supersymmetric standard models that can be constructed from the weakly coupled heterotic string theory directly , to achieve the @xmath15 and @xmath16 gauge coupling unification at the string scale , we either need intermediate - scale ( @xmath17 ) threshold corrections or very large string - scale threshold corrections  @xcite , which violates the requirement ( 3 ) . in addition , to achieve string - scale gauge coupling unification , we should introduce at the tev scale sets of vector - like particles in gut multiplets , whose contribution to the one - loop beta functions of the @xmath4 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 gauge symmetry , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , satisfy @xmath21 . since there is no such set of vector - like particles forming complete gut representations in the pati - salam models with symmetric @xmath15 and @xmath22 , we can not achieve the string - scale gauge coupling unification with the above requirements .",
    "furthermore , in the pati - salam models with asymmetric @xmath15 and @xmath22 , similar to the mssm or standard - like supersymmetric standard models we can not achieve the string - scale gauge coupling unification for @xmath23 or @xmath24 unless there exist intermediate - scale or very large string - scale threshold corrections .",
    "thus , in this paper we will not consider the mssm , standard - like supersymmetric standard models , and pati - salam models with asymmetric @xmath15 and @xmath22 , although these models can be constructed in the weakly coupled heterotic string theory  @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , in the flipped @xmath0 models  @xcite , we do have such kind of vector - like particles , for instance , the @xmath25 and @xmath26 with respectively the quantum numbers @xmath27 and @xmath28 under the @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "especially , flipped @xmath0 models can be constructed naturally in the weakly coupled heterotic string theory at kac - moody level one  @xcite .",
    "therefore , with the requirements above , we can only achieve the string - scale gauge coupling unification in the flipped @xmath0 models elegantly .",
    "in fact , introducing such vector - like particles with masses in the intermediate scale , the string - scale gauge coupling unification has been realized previously  @xcite .",
    "we also require that all the gauge couplings have no landau pole problem below the string scale . to systematically study the string - scale gauge coupling unification , we consider all the possible sets of vector - like particles with masses around the tev scale .",
    "and we introduce vector - like particles with masses close to the string scale which can mimic the string - scale threshold corrections .",
    "we emphasize that all of these vector - like particles can be obtained in the interesting flipped @xmath0 string models from the four - dimensional free fermionic formulation of the weakly coupled heterotic string theory  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for the supersymmetry breaking scenarios , we will consider the low energy supersymmetry , high - scale supersymmetry  @xcite , and split supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "we will show that the string - scale gauge coupling unification can indeed be realized .",
    "for the high - scale supersymmetry and split supersymmetry , we also calculate the corresponding higgs boson masses .",
    "furthermore , we briefly discuss a simple flipped @xmath0 model with string - scale gauge coupling unification and high - scale supersymmetry breaking by introducing only one pair of the vector - like particles at the tev scale , and we predict the higgs boson masses . also , we briefly comment on a simple model with low - energy supersymmetry and one pair of intermediate - scale vector - like particles .",
    "and we briefly comment on the mixings among the sm fermions and the corresponding extra vector - like particles .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly review the flipped @xmath0 models and the calculations of higgs boson mass in the high - scale supersymmetry and split supersymmetry .",
    "we study the string - scale gauge coupling unification in the flipped @xmath0 models in section iii .",
    "we discuss simple flipped @xmath0 models with string - scale gauge coupling unification in section iv .",
    "we comment on the mixings among the sm fermions and the corresponding extra vector - like particles in section v. our discussion and conclusions are in section vi .",
    "the renormalization group equations ( rges ) and beta functions for the non - supersymmetric and supersymmetric standard models with additional vector - like particles are given in appendix a , and for the flipped @xmath0 models with additional vector - like particles are given in appendix b.",
    "in this subsection , we would like to briefly review the flipped @xmath12 model  @xcite .",
    "the gauge group for flipped @xmath12 model is @xmath29 , which can be embedded into @xmath13 model .",

[ higgse1 ] we label the states in the @xmath40 multiplet by the same symbols as in the @xmath41 multiplet , and for @xmath42 we just add `` bar '' above the fields .",
