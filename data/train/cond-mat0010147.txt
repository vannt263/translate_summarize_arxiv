    "the modification of the dynamical properties of liquids in confined environment relative to the bulk is a field of rapidly growing interest because of the close connection with relevant technological and biophysical problems .",
    "the specific differences in behavior are , among others , due to different interactions between liquid and substrate , the size of the confining region , and the size of the particles composing the liquid .",
    "nonetheless some underlying common features can be sorted out of the extremely rich and diversified phenomenology available .",
    "@xcite in fact there are two main causes for the change of dynamics of a confined liquid with respect to its bulk phase : the first is the influence of the interactions of the liquid with a rough surface , which is expected to slow down the dynamics ; the second is the confinement effect that can lead to an increase in the free volume of a molecule , which then results in accelerated dynamics together with a decrease of the glass transition temperature relative to the one of the bulk phase .",
    "the interplay between these two effects depends crucially on the particle density and the size of the confining system .",
    "@xcite    in particular the dynamical properties of water in restricted geometries and at interfaces have recently been studied intensely because of the important effects in systems of interest to biology , chemistry , and geophysics , whose behavior depends on how the pore size and structure influence the diffusion of water .",
    "those properties are particularly relevant in understanding phenomena like the mobility of water in biological channels  @xcite or the dynamics of hydrated proteins .",
    "@xcite    it is well known that liquid water shows a very peculiar behavior in the supercooled phase .",
    "the study of water approaching a glass phase is still a challenging problem since below @xmath0  k one enters the so called _ no man s land _",
    "@xcite , where nucleation processes take place and drive the liquid to the solid crystalline phase , preventing the observation of the glass transition .",
    "@xcite it is unclear until now how confinement could change this scenario .",
    "it would be particularly important to understand whether the glass transition temperature could be experimentally accessible for confined water . in this respect",
    "the modifications induced by the confinement on the dynamics of water on supercooling are of extreme interest .",
    "computer simulation is a very suitable tool for exploring the liquid in the range of the supercooled regime without the limitations of the nucleation process which takes place in the real experiment .",
    "dynamical properties of different types of liquids in confined geometries have been studied in recent years by computer simulation .",
    "@xcite for water confined in micropores there are a number of computer simulation studies on the mobility of water .",
    "@xcite it is still difficult , however , to find general trends ; systematic studies of the dynamics of confined water have not been attempted until now .    for confined and interfacial water inelastic neutron scattering and nmr spectroscopy found a slowing down of the dynamics relative to the bulk phase .",
    "@xcite for water in contact with proteins there are also signatures of a transition of adsorbed water to a glassy state , which is driven by the protein surface .",
    "@xcite moreover , recent simulation and experimental studies showed a typical spectral glassy anomaly , the so called boson peak .",
    "@xcite    in the many experimental studies of confined water that have been performed water in vycor is of particular interest  @xcite , since vycor is a porous silica glass characterized by a quite sharp distribution of pore sizes with an average diameter of @xmath1   .",
    "the pore size does not depend on the hydration level and the surface of the pore is strongly hydrophilic .",
    "moreover , the water - in - vycor system can be considered as a prototype for more complex situations of interfacial water .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we present the results of a molecular dynamics study of the single particle dynamics of water confined in a silica cavity modeled to represent the average properties of the pores of vycor glass .",
    "@xcite we will concentrate on the dynamical behavior of the confined water at half hydration on supercooling . in previous studies",
    "the static properties of this system were investigated .",
    "@xcite    in the second section we recall the general theoretical background which concerns the modern interpretation of the glass transition and we will concentrate on a short description of the mode coupling theory ( mct ) .",
    "@xcite in section iii we explain the technical details of our simulation of molecular dynamics ( md ) . in section iv we discuss the important layering effect that we observe in the confined water .",
    "this effect forms the basis for a layer analysis of the dynamical results that we introduced for the density correlator .",
    "@xcite in section v this analysis is carried out for the system at ambient conditions . by means of this layer analysis",
    "we can find agreement with the mct predictions and estimate the values of some relevant parameters of the theory as exposed in section vi where the properties of the system upon supercooling are analyzed .",
    "section vii is devoted to the conclusions of our work .",
    "glasses are a very popular subject of the contemporary science literature .",
    "but in spite of the huge experimental , computational and theoretical efforts made , a unified picture able to account for the behavior of the liquid from its normal state throughout supercooling and vitrification is still lacking .",
    "theoretical physicists are developing a first principle theory for glasses  @xcite , based on the phenomenological ideas introduced by kauzmann  @xcite and developed later by adam , gibbs and di marzio .",
    "@xcite    a scenario emerges that can be pictured by considering the free energy landscape or alternatively the potential energy landscape .",
    "@xcite in the high temperature regime the free energy functional has only one relevant minimum and correspondingly there are several directions in the configurational space with negative eigenvalues .",
    "the liquid behaves `` normally '' , and diffusion is stochastic , i.e. , there is only one relevant timescale and the relaxation process is of debye type . as one starts supercooling ( i.e. cooling the system below the melting temperature @xmath2 ) the system approaches an important crossover temperature @xmath3 referred to as the temperature of kinetic glass transition .",
    "mct  @xcite in its idealized version is able to describe the dynamics of the liquid in great detail with precise predictions on the behavior and the analytical shape of the density correlators ( see next subsection ) for systems sufficiently close to , yet above @xmath3 .",
    "the region above @xmath3 is only landscape influenced .",
    "@xcite at @xmath4 the number of directions leading to different basins goes to zero .",
    "@xcite in the region below @xmath3 there is an exponentially large number of minima in the free energy separated by barriers that are high compared to thermal energy . in this respect @xmath3 represents a cross - over temperature from a liquid - like regime to a solid - like regime where only hopping processes can restore ergodicity .",
    "below @xmath3 the supercooled liquid is in fact frequently trapped in one of the local free energy minima and only activated processes take the system from one minimum to another one in the energy landscape .",
    "@xcite this region is strongly landscape dominated .",
    "@xcite    in the `` many valley picture '' the liquid - glass transition occurs at the kauzmann temperature @xmath5 , where the configurational entropy , which measures the logarithm of the number of accessible minima , vanishes and , correspondingly , the free energy barriers diverge .  @xcite the transition at @xmath5 can be considered as an ideal glass transition which can take place only at an infinitely slow cooling rate , where it would be signaled by the divergence of the viscosity .",
    "this ideal second order transition is related to the singularities which are found at finite cooling rate in experiments at the conventional glass transition temperature , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "in this paper we will focus on the relatively high temperature region where dynamics can be studied by md , i.e. the supercooled region where @xmath8 is above and approaches @xmath3 . here",
    "mct in its idealized version works very well for many systems .",
    "@xcite    mct is able to describe the dynamics of a liquid when the single entity , molecule or atom , is trapped by the transient cage formed by its nearest neighbors .",
    "this transient caging is responsible for the stretching of the relaxation laws and the separation of time scales . in its idealized version mct",
    "does not take into account the hopping processes .",
    "this version predicts a transition to a non - ergodic system at @xmath3 , when all the cages are frozen .",
    "nonetheless , hopping processes are not relevant for most liquids above @xmath3 .",
    "an asymptotic expansion in the region near the ideal singularity ( at @xmath3 ) yields predictions of the functional form of the time correlators and the critical exponents .",
    "these predictions have been tested both by experiments and md simulations for many glass formers .",
    "mct thus renders possible , among others , an estimate of the behavior of the time correlators close to the crossover temperature .",
    "@xcite    mct predicts a two - step relaxation for the dynamics , which is the signature of the cage effect .",
    "well above @xmath3 , after an initial ballistic regime , the particle enters the stochastic diffusion regime , and its mean square displacement ( msd ) increases linearly with time . in the supercooled region above @xmath3 , after the short time ballistic regime , the particle is trapped by the barrier created by the nearest - neighbor cage ; brownian diffusion is restored only when this cage relaxes .",
    "this behavior is reflected in the self part of the density autocorrelation function , and in any other correlator which has a nonzero overlap with the density . in particular ,",
    "when approaching @xmath3 from the liquid side , the fourier transform of the density correlator , the self intermediate scattering function ( isf ) , @xmath9 , has a two step relaxation behavior with a fast and a slow decay .",
    "after the fast decay it enters a plateau region , corresponding to the rattling of the particle in the nearest - neighbor cage , which is called the @xmath10-relaxation region . after the time interval of the plateau , which becomes longer when approaching @xmath3 , the function @xmath9 decays to zero",
    "this long time relaxation is called @xmath11-relaxation . in the @xmath11-relaxation region",
    "it has been shown that the relaxation process is well described by a stretched exponential @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the long relaxation time and @xmath10 is called the kohlrausch exponent .",
    "mct predicts that , when @xmath3 is approached , the @xmath11-relaxation takes place on increasingly longer time scales , so that the relaxation time @xmath13 diverges with a power law @xmath14 as a consequence , the diffusion coefficient @xmath15 , which is predicted to be proportional to @xmath16 , goes to zero at @xmath3 with the power law @xmath17 .    in the idealized version of mct",
    "the system becomes non - ergodic at @xmath3 , defined as the temperature of structural arrest ; below @xmath3 the cages are frozen and only hopping processes can restore ergodicity . extended mct  @xcite takes into account this effect .    finally , we recall that , since the mct description of the kinetic glass transition is based on the cage effect , the relevant length scales are of the order of the nearest - neighbor distances . consequently the dynamical quantities in @xmath18 space display this effect most clearly for values of @xmath18 close to the maximum of the static structure factor @xmath19 .      in recent years",
    "it was discovered that spc / e  @xcite supercooled water has a temperature of structural arrest @xmath3  @xcite coinciding with the so called singular temperature @xmath20 of speedy and angell .",
    "@xcite as stated above , mct predicts that close to @xmath3 the liquid dynamics is dominated by the `` cage effect '' .",
    "water does not behave like normal glass - forming fluids in this regard , since the cage effect is not a consequence of an increase of density upon supercooling but rather seems to be determined by the increase of the hydrogen bond stiffness , which makes the cage more rigid as the temperature is lowered below room temperature .",
    "the long time behavior of the single particle dynamics is well described in terms of the mct and the dependence of @xmath13 ( and @xmath15 ) on temperature are found to agree with the power law , eq.([taul ] ) .",
    "successive simulations over a wide range of pressures and temperatures  @xcite and theoretical studies  @xcite fully confirmed the mct behavior of this potential .",

    "they are similar to features found in other simulation studies ; for typically strong glass formers they can be attributed to the so called boson peak ( bp ) .",

    "since we can carry out a precise line shape analysis by using only two relaxation processes , where the long time part is perfectly described by the @xmath11 relaxation of the mct , we can test the predictions of the mct which concern the values for the kohlrausch exponent @xmath10 and the long relaxation time @xmath13 .",

    "the behavior of the parameters is compatible with the mct .",
    "as shown in the insets of both figures the kohlrausch exponent @xmath10 starts from values close to 1 at low @xmath18 and high temperatures and reaches a common plateau at large @xmath18 .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with the interpretation of the kinetic glass transition by mct in terms of the cage effect , since for @xmath51 larger than the cage size we expect to find that the stretching of the exponential at long time eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) is less relevant .",
    "thus the kohlrausch exponent is expected to go to 1 for large @xmath51 when the system enters the normal debye regime of diffusion in the long time decay region of the isf .",
    "of course this limit is reached at higher values of @xmath18 at higher temperatures , where the debye regime is more easily established , as seen in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] and  [ fig:15 ] .",
    "the oscillation in the plateau region does not allow for the calculation of the mct parameters a and b related to the power laws of approach to and departure from the plateau .",
    "it is however shown that for large @xmath18 values the kohlrausch exponent coincides with the scaling exponent b.  @xcite we therefore obtain @xmath52 in this system for both the @xmath40 and the @xmath30 directions .",

    "this behavior is common for glass formers close to the kinetic glass transition and has been found for instance in glycerol .",
    "@xcite in the interpretation we must take into account that @xmath13 measures the timescale of the final relaxation of the cage with the subsequent decay of the self correlation function of the densities over the length scale @xmath51 and the diffusion of the molecule over distances of the order @xmath51 . in the diffusive regime valid for large @xmath51 we expect @xmath54 . at variance with bulk water",
    "we do not find any crossover of the behavior of @xmath16 from a @xmath53 to a @xmath18 proportionality at high @xmath18 ,  @xcite except , perhaps , at the lowest temperature .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] there is a clear evidence of a bump at @xmath38  ps which is preserved at the different temperatures as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] for @xmath55  @xmath56 .",
    "the position of the bump is independent of @xmath18 , which is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] at @xmath32  k and which is also found at all other explored temperatures . as mentioned in sec .",
    "vi  a , similar effects have been observed in computer simulations of other glass formers  @xcite and have been attributed to the existence of a boson peak ( bp ) .",
    "the bp is present in many glasses as a consequence of an excess of vibrational modes and can be detected even in computer simulation in spite of the finite size effects .",
    "@xcite we do not want to enter here in a detailed discussion of this behavior , but we recall that the bp is considered as a precursor of a glass transition when it appears in the liquid state .",
    "we notice that as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] , the bp feature appears clearly for the inner shells while it is much less evident in the outer layer contribution .",
    "while in some respect the substrate seems to enhance the effect relative to bulk water  @xcite , it appears that water in the outer shells is not able to sustain the vibrations which are considered responsible of the overshoot , possibly because we keep the atoms of the silica substrate rigid during the simulation .",
    "we intend to discuss this point more extensively in a future paper .",
    "the technique that allows for the best comparison with our md results is quasielastic neutron scattering ( qens ) .",
    "in fact the self dynamic structure factor as measured by incoherent qens is the time fourier transform of the isf .",
    "the first data appeared in literature on water - in - vycor were well fitted with a jump - diffusion model in a confined medium .",
    "@xcite this model was giving reasonable relaxation times , but the size of the confining region was unrealistic , @xmath57   .",
    "an analysis based on mct of those data was successively proposed .",
    "@xcite the data were also well fitted and the results were consistent with the appearance upon supercooling of a slow dynamics due to the approach to the kinetic glass transition .",
    "the @xmath18 dependence of the inverse of the structural relaxation time appeared for the @xmath58 hydration level upon supercooling , as a power law with an exponent ranging from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "@xcite the fits were however performed on a limited @xmath18 range , approximately from @xmath61 to @xmath62  @xmath56 .",
    "these findings have been confirmed by a recent qens experiment where a full set of high resolution data on water confined in vycor glass has been analyzed for different hydration levels upon supercooling .",
    "@xcite the experimental exponents obtained from the fits to a limited range of @xmath18 appear to be slightly different from ours .",
    "in fact we find , see figs .",
    "[ fig:14]-  [ fig:15 ] , a value which is approximately @xmath63 at high temperatures and slightly decreases for the lowest temperature .",
    "however an analysis performed on a more extended q value data , up to @xmath64  @xmath56 showed an exponent which is @xmath63 at high temperature and decreases at lower temperatures , similar to what we found in the present simulation .",
    "@xcite    it is important to notice that the qens response function is able to probe only the mobile water , namely the water above @xmath3 , because of experimental resolution limitations .",
    "therefore the experimental data appear so far compatible with our findings .",
    "in this paper we presented the results obtained by molecular dynamics on the single particle dynamics of spc / e water confined in a silica pore , which represents an approximation to the system of water confined in vycor .",
    "this system can also be considered as representative of the more general case of water confined in a hydrophilic nanopore .    through the study of dynamic time correlators such as the mean square displacement ( msd ) and the self part of the intermediate scattering factor ( isf ) , we investigated the onset of slow dynamics when the hydration level in the pore is decreased or when the liquid is supercooled .    at ambient temperature we found that upon decreasing the hydration level a flattening of the msd takes place after the initial ballistic regime and before the onset of the stochastic diffusion . in correspondence",
    "a two step relaxation behavior appears in the isf , which displays a strongly non - exponential decay at long time . in this way",
    "the single particle dynamics has the signatures of the presence of a cage effect as predicted by mode coupling theory ( mct ) .",
    "apparently the effect of hydration is similar to the effect of supercooling in bulk water , but the long time relaxation of the isf can not be fitted by the stretched exponential predicted by the mct . by performing a layer analysis it becomes possible to separate the contribution to the dynamics of the water molecules close to the substrate ( bound water ) from the contribution coming from the molecules which are in the internal layers ( free water ) .",
    "the subset of molecules belonging to the bound water shows density oscillations and appears to be in a glassy state with very low mobility already at ambient conditions .",
    "the free water shows a dynamical behavior typical of glass forming liquids .",
    "this behavior can be accounted for by the idealized mct in analogy with previous findings on spc / e water in the bulk phase .",
    "@xcite we would like to stress , however , that in the present work we have considered a much more complex system than the bulk , where an additional anisotropic effect and a perturbation by the substrate is present .",
    "the fact that mct could be used in this framework as a unifying theoretical approach is highly relevant as a guideline for the systematic study of the important phenomenology of confined and interfacial water .",
    "we show evidence that the hydration level together with the hydrophilicity of the substrate play , through the layering effect , an important role in determining the dynamical properties of confined water . as far as the anisotropy of the system",
    "is concerned , we did not observe large differences in the behavior along the confined direction ( @xmath40 ) and along the pore axis ( @xmath30 ) , where periodic boundary conditions are applied , apart from the fact that the mobility along the @xmath40 direction is smaller than in the @xmath30 direction .    by supercooling confined water at half hydration",
    "we have found that the subset of free water undergoes a kinetic glass transition , which can be described in terms of the mct .",
    "the layer analysis makes possible the calculation of various important quantities related to the glass transition , like the temperature of structural arrest , @xmath3 , and the critical exponent @xmath65 .",
    "similar results have been obtained from a preliminary analysis of the full hydration case .",
    "@xcite    mct has been largely used in the interpretation of the phenomenology of liquids in the supercooled phase . in the recent attempts to develop a unified first - principles theory for the glass transition",
    "it has been recognized that mct keeps its validity in describing the liquid just above the temperature @xmath3 .",
    "it is time to test this theory for confined fluids , where , in spite of the experimental and computer simulation efforts , the phenomenology of the dynamics of the confined and interfacial liquids upon supercooling is still unclear .",
    "we have shown evidence that the mct can be applied to the interpretation of the dynamical behavior of supercooled confined water , if the layering effects determined by the interaction with the hydrophilic substrate are carefully taken into account .",

    "<S> the time density correlators show , already at ambient temperature , strong deviations from the debye and the stretched exponential behavior . both on decreasing hydration level and upon supercooling we find features that can be related to the cage effect typical of a supercooled liquid undergoing a kinetic glass transition . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless the behavior predicted by mode coupling theory can be observed only by carrying out a proper shell analysis of the density correlators . </S>",
    "<S> water molecules within the first two layers from the substrate are in a glassy state already at ambient temperature ( bound water ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining subset of molecules ( free water ) undergoes a kinetic glass transition ; the relaxation of the density correlators agree with the main predictions of the theory . from our data </S>",
