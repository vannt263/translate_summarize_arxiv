    "however , not all cases of practical interest were explored in these early studies .",
    "one relevant example is scattering in the yukawa potential in the limit of very strong interaction  @xcite .",
    "this limit received attention only after it was recognized that it applies to elastic collisions involving highly ( negatively ) charged particles in complex ( dusty ) plasmas  @xcite .",
    "the interaction can be either repulsive ( particle - particle collisions ) or attractive ( particle - ion collisions ) .",
    "more recently , the results for classical scattering in the yukawa potential in the limit of strong interaction  @xcite have been used in the context of transport properties of strongly coupled plasmas  @xcite and to describe self - scattering of dark matter particles  @xcite .    an interesting result from the studies of classical scattering in the strongly attractive yukawa potential",
