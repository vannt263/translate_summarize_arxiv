    "none of the standard model particles can account for the dark matter that makes up most of the mass in the universe .",
    "we report the latest results of a search for dark matter in the form of relic sterile neutrinos ( see kusenko 2009 for an up - to - date review ) .",
    "the motivation for considering the sterile neutrino , one of a number of feasible dark - matter candidates , is two - fold .",
    "first , the discovery of ordinary neutrino masses is most easily accommodated by means of the so - called seesaw mechanism , which calls for some new gauge - singlet fermions .",
    "if all of these fermions have very large majorana masses , there are no additional degrees of freedom ( particles ) at the low energy scale . however",
    ", if one of these mass parameters lies in the 130  kev range , the corresponding _ sterile _ neutrino can be the long sought - after dark matter particle  @xcite .",
    "second , the physics of supernovae , that often assists in ruling out hypothetical low - mass particles , provides some intriguing clues in favor of the existence of sterile neutrinos with the same parameters that are required to explain dark matter .",
    "such particles would be anisotropically emitted from a cooling newly born neutron star , inducing a sufficient recoil momentum in the neutron star to explain the observed velocities of pulsars  @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations offer the best probe of this well - motivated dark - matter candidate  @xcite . in the early universe",
    ", sterile neutrinos may be produced through non - resonant oscillations @xcite , resonant oscillations  @xcite and via various other channels  @xcite . the kinetic properties of dark matter relevant for structure formation on small scales ( i.e. , how `` warm '' or `` cold '' the dark matter is ) depend on the production scenario , as well as the particle mass  @xcite .",
    "the generic prediction is that relic sterile neutrinos must decay into a lighter neutrino and a photon  @xcite .",
    "since this two - body decay of a 130  kev mass particle produces a narrow line with energy @xmath3 , x - ray astronomy provides a unique opportunity to discover these relic particles .",
    "archival x - ray data has been used to set limits on relic sterile neutrinos ( see the review in kusenko 2009 ) .",
    "in addition , a dedicated search for sterile neutrinos using the _ suzaku _ x - ray telescope has recently been conducted by  @xcite ( hereafter , lkb ) . here",
    "we will present new results from the search using the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory .",
    "our analysis of data on the willman 1 dwarf spheroidal galaxy yields evidence of a 2.5  kev line , consistent with the decay of a relic sterile neutrino with mass 5  kev ; and , with an inferred line strength consistent with that expected if all of the dark matter is composed of sterile neutrinos produced by oscillations .      given the uncertainty in sterile neutrino properties , and the importance of dark matter discovery , one ought to explore the x - ray band with existing instruments using well - chosen targets .",
    "while the decay timescale greatly exceeds the hubble time  @xcite , the emissivity may reach detectable levels in regions of large dark matter surface density , such as galaxy clusters , m31 , and local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the last offer , arguably , the most promising opportunity because of the proximity and high dark matter density in these systems , and the absence of additional competing internal x - ray sources .",
    "_ suzaku _ observing cycle 2 observing time was awarded time to study the best available targets at that time : the ursa minor and draco dwarf spheroidals ( lkb ) .",
    "subsequently , a new sub - population of faint milky way satellites discovered in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) were found to have very high mass - to - light ratios @xcite .",
    "these rival or surpass ursa minor and draco as compelling targets for sterile neutrino searches .",
    "we were awarded 100 ks of observing time in _ chandra _ cycle 10 to investigate one of these  namely willman 1 .",
    "these data represent the first x - ray observations of this extreme system ; and , we report on our findings here .",
    "the basic equations relating the galaxy parameters ( distance 100@xmath4 kpc , dark matter mass in projection @xmath5 m@xmath6 ) , x - ray observables ( line energy @xmath7 , line flux @xmath8 ) , and sterile neutrino parameters ( mass @xmath9 , mixing angle @xmath10 , fraction of dark matter in sterile neutrinos @xmath11 ) , are the following ( loewenstein et al .",
    "2009 , kusenko 2009 , and references therein ) : @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 the abundance of sterile neutrinos produced through non - resonant oscillations may be calculated for given values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , assuming the standard early thermal history of the universe .",
    "this relation determines @xmath11 as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , assuming that all sterile neutrinos are produced in this way as first proposed by @xcite , and lower limits on @xmath11 if there is some non - negligible lepton asymmetry  @xcite or if some other production channels contributed more than the oscillations to the sterile neutrino relic abundance  @xcite .",
    "lkb did not detect a sterile neutrino emission line in ursa minor _ suzaku _ spectra .",
    "the line flux upper limit was used to derive an excluded region in the @xmath15 plane for the case where all of the dark matter is composed of sterile neutrinos .",
    "a more general constraint was inferred from the condition that the line flux upper limit not be overproduced through oscillations at the sterile neutrino relic density corresponding to each pair ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we derived line flux upper limits using a maximum - likelihood approach that , along with the lack of intrinsic x - ray emission , enabled us to minimize systematics , and account for those that remained .",
    "the resulting constraints on sterile neutrinos are illustrated in figure 9 of lkb .",
    "although the constraints from this single _ suzaku _ observation are comparable to previous results over the entire 120 kev mass , the allowed range does not rule out sterile neutrinos as a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "we therefore expanded our search to the willman 1 system  conducting the first x - ray observation of one of the new sdss dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "the capabilities of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory are well - suited to the compact size of willman 1 ; and , these data provide a good complement to the broader beam observations of the more extended classical milky way dwarf spheroidals ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "willman 1 ( _ chandra _ obsid 10534 , seqnum 600727 ) was observed by _",
    "chandra _ on january 27 - 28 2009 for 102745.5 seconds .",
    "the data was taken in timed vfaint mode , and was pipeline - processed on 2009 - 2 - 10 using ascdsver 7.6.11.10 .",
    "we use ciao version 4.1.2 ( caldb 4.1.4 ) , and xspec version 12.5 in our analysis .",
    "chips 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 were on during the observation .",
    "willman 1 was positioned at the acis - i aimpoint , and we generally restrict our analysis to the i - array ( chips 0 - 3 ) data .",
    "we analyze the standard level 2 event file , and also reprocess the level 1 event file in order to implement the vfaint data - mode quiescent background reduction technique . for the latter ,",
    "likely background events are flagged based on the pulse heights in border pixels of the 5x5 pixel event islands ; default split threshold and trail parameters are adopted .",
    "these events , as well as those corresponding to bad grades , are removed as the new level 2 event file is generated .",
    "no flares are found upon examination of the light curves ; and , time intervals where the count rate deviates by more than 10% of the mean are excised .",
    "the final exposure times are 99400 and 97100 seconds for the cleaned pipeline processed and reprocessed event files , respectively .",
    "we consider off - axis ( s2 , _",
    "i.e. _ chip 6 ) , blank sky , and stowed data sets as candidates for constructing background spectra .",
    "the last corresponds to events collected with the acis stowed while the hrc - i is in the focal plane ; and , has been demonstrated to be consistent with the dark moon .",
    "that is , it can provide an estimate of the pure particle background ( pb ) .",
    "in contrast , the blank sky and s2 data include the cosmic ( cxb ) and galactic ( gxb ) x - ray backgrounds ( which vary over the sky , especially the gxb ) .",
    "the blank sky and stowed event files are reprojected using the willman 1 aspect solution .",
    "the quiescent pb reduction procedure may also be applied to these background event files .",
    "if dark matter is composed of sterile neutrinos , their presence in the milky way results in line emission in the s2 and blank sky data that will reduce the signal if subtracted out as background . additionally , the s2 chip is still within the solid angle subtended by the willman 1 dark halo ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , our constraints are derived from the pb - subtracted spectra from which no astrophysical sources of extended x - ray emission have been eliminated .",
    "source and background spectra are extracted from identical @xmath17 circular apertures centered on the willman 1 position or its equivalent in detector coordinates , except for the s2 chip background spectrum that is extracted from a @xmath18 circle optimized in a way that accounts for chip uniformity and point sources near the edge of the chip .",
    "the s2 chip center is @xmath19 ( 165 pc ) from the position of willman 1 , and lies outside the region where stellar velocities are measured .",
    "the allowed dark matter profile thus spans a large range : the average surface mass density in this field may be as large as @xmath20% , or as small as @xmath21% , that in the central i - array extraction region .",
    "regions corresponding to point sources detected in the willman 1 image via application of the ciao wavelet point source detection algorithm are excluded .",
    "background spectra are re - scaled based on the relative count rates in the 9 - 12 kev band where virtually all events are due to the pb .",
    "the pb has been found to vary significantly in normalization , but not in shape , so that the rescaled pb spectra can be used to construct an appropriate pb - subtracted source spectrum .      in our analysis of the _ suzaku _ data on the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy",
    ", we based our constraints on the total ( unsubtracted ) spectrum . because the _ chandra _ pb is higher , but more precisely determined",
    ", we adopt a more conventional approach here and consider background - subtracted spectra , grouped to a minimum of 15 counts per bin , utilizing @xmath22 statistics to derive best fits and parameter uncertainties .",
    "the cleanest pb subtraction is realized utilizing the source and stowed background spectra with application of the vfaint data - mode quiescent background reduction technique , although using the corresponding pipeline - processed datasets yielded similar results ( with slightly larger uncertainties ) .",
    "the source spectrum is fitted with a model consisting of a solar abundance thermal plasma ( to model the gxb ) and power - law ( to model the cxb ) absorbed by the galactic column density . in this case",
    "the gxb component is not required , although the upper limit on the flux is consistent with the larger - scale average gxb surface brightness measured in the _",
    "rosat all - sky survey_. the best - fit ( @xmath23 ) power - law photon index is 1.8 ( 1.4 - 2.7 at 90% confidence ) , and the normalization consistent with the fraction of the cxb unresolved by our observation ( @xmath24% ; mushotzky et al .",
    "figures 1a and 1b show the total , ( stowed ) background , and background - subtracted spectra for cases utilizing pipeline - processed , and reprocessed ( reduced - background ) event lists . the best - fit power - law model , and fit residuals , are also shown .",
    "we show the full 0.3 - 12 kev energy band , although the fits are conducted over 0.4 - 7 kev .",
    "there are pb - related residuals in the background - subtracted spectrum above 7 kev where the _ chandra _ sensitivity experiences a steep decline .",
    "some of these persistent residuals may be attributed to the fact that the time - dependent gain correction can not be re - applied to the background data , as was done with the source data .",
    "the blank - sky background ( sb ) is significantly brighter than the source spectrum below 1 kev .",
    "the total pb - subtracted 0.4 - 7 kev surface brightness is @xmath25 higher in the sb than in willman 1 . evidently the gxb is brighter in the former and , as a result , the sb - subtracted spectrum ought to be utilized with care ( figure 2 ) .",
    "also , as previously mentioned , if there is dark matter decay in the x - ray band there will be a contribution from the milky way halo to the sb that is absent in the pb .",
    "in deriving upper limits , we divide the spectrum into low ( @xmath26 kev ) and high ( @xmath27 kev ) energy segments , since any gxb emission will be negligible in the latter .",
    "the high energy segment best - fit ( @xmath28 ) power - law slope is 1.77 ( 1.22 - 2.37 at 90% , confidence ) . at low energies , power - law ( @xmath29 , slope = @xmath30 ) and thermal * apec * ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 kev ) models provide acceptable fits .",
    "we conduct monte carlo numerical experiments ( lkb , and references therein ) where we find that , in fits to simulated continua spectra with models that include an emission line , the fit is improved by @xmath33 with @xmath34% frequency  closely approximating that for a @xmath22 distribution with two degrees of freedom .",
    "we thus adopt @xmath33 flux limits , derived from adding an unresolved gaussian component in 10 ev intervals over the 0.4 - 7 kev bandpass to simulated spectra of the best - fit line - free model .",
    "the errors are averages over 100 simulations that are initiated using parameters from fits to a seed simulation ( and not the best - fit parameters to the actual data ) , so that the uncertainties in the parameter values are taken into account .",
    "line fluxes are allowed to go negative ( as is the case with the simulations ) .",
    "the upper and lower line flux limits , in 200 ev bins , based on the pb - subtracted fits are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the latter are negative over the entire 0.4 - 7 kev bandpass .",
    "the constraints based on the sb - subtracted fits are similar in magnitude above 2 kev .     line flux upper ( solid histogram ) and lower ( broken histogram ) limits in photons @xmath35 s@xmath36 . ]",
    "the mapping of the willman 1 constraints onto the sterile - neutrino - mass - mixing - angle plane ( equation 4 ) is shown in figure 4a . as discussed above ( section 1.3",
    "; see also section 3 in lkb and section 5 below ) there are two kinds of limits , both of which are shown .",
    "the first assumes only that the thermal history of the universe is given by standard big bang cosmology .",
    "sterile neutrinos are ruled out for the region in parameter space where the flux from sterile neutrinos produced at minimal abundance via the dw mechanism @xcite exceeds our derived limits .",
    "the second limit is that which overpredicts the derived limits if sterile neutrinos account for 100% of the dark matter ( dark - matter fraction of sterile neutrinos @xmath37 ) , regardless of how they are produced . in figure 4b ,",
    "the former limits , which are the most general , are compared with those we derived in ursa minor with _",
    "the smaller _ chandra _ beam and more compact willman 1 dark matter distribution compensate somewhat for the higher sensitivity of the _ suzaku _ measurement to yield constraints at sterile neutrino masses @xmath38 kev ( corresponding to photon energies in the spectra @xmath39 kev ) of similar magnitude to those derived for ursa minor in lkb .",
    "this comparison utilizes a projected mass enclosed within the relevant radius of 55 pc ( @xmath17 at 38 kpc ) @xmath40 m@xmath6  corresponding to a mass surface density of @xmath41 m@xmath42  as determined by projecting the best - fit nfw @xcite mass model in @xcite .",
    "the 90% confidence contours for the nfw parameters allow values of @xmath43 that are @xmath44 lower , and @xmath45 higher .",
    "in addition , we estimate that the milky way dark matter halo and the extragalactic dark matter contribute an additional @xmath46 m@xmath42 ( xue at al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) .",
    "while maintaining a fiducial mass of @xmath47 m@xmath6 , we show the effect on the general constraints of varying the surface density , and hence the effective mass in the fov , by factor of two in either direction in figure 4b .",

    "in addition to the limits derived above , we present evidence of a spectral feature consistent with a 2.5  kev line from decay of a 5  kev relic sterile neutrino .",
    "the largest residual excess emission to the pb - subtracted willman 1 spectrum with respect to the best - fit continuum model occurs at @xmath49 kev .",
    "when we add an additional gaussian component , we find that @xmath22 improves by 5 ( figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "the line - width is consistent with an unresolved feature broadened only by the instrumental line spread function , as expected considering the small willman 1 velocity dispersion . for",
    "power - law - plus - gaussian fits to the 2.2 - 5 kev spectrum , the best - fits and uncertainties on the line energy and flux are @xmath50 kev and @xmath1\\times 10^{-6}\\ { \\rm photons}\\ { \\rm cm}^{-2}\\ { \\rm s}^{-1}$ ] , where the errors are 68% ( 90% ) confidence limits for two degrees of freedom corresponding to @xmath51 ( 4.61 ) ( section 3 ; yaqoob 1998 ) .",
    "the corresponding confidence contours are shown in figure 7 , as is the @xmath52 ( 99% confidence ) contour .",
    "the 2.2 kev limit was chosen to avoid the energy associated of the peak of the brightest of the pb au fluorescence lines , and with the deep _ chandra _ mirror iridium edge ( chartas et al .",
    "2000 ; there is also a shallow edge at @xmath53 kev that does not impact our results ) .",
    "the issue of these instrumental features is specifically addressed in section 4.2.4 . however , extending the range to the full 1.1 - 7 kev high energy segment bandpass yields a consistent measurement ( @xmath54\\times 10^{-6}\\ { \\rm photons}\\ { \\rm    cm}^{-2}\\ { \\rm s}^{-1}$ ] ) as do fits over other subsets of this bandpass . in the 2.4 - 2.6 kev energy interval , the total , pb , and source counts are @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , respectively . in the composite models the emission line component accounts for 90% of the flux .",
    "20 counts in this interval are expected based on the best - fit power - law model _ without a line_. figure 8 shows the unfolded spectrum  the ratio of the data values to the product of the model multiplied by the response , all multiplied by the model values  over the 1.5 - 5 kev spectral region .",
    "the feature is not positively detected in the global blank sky spectrum ( abazajian et al .",
    "2007 , and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath58 upper limit based on the reprojected estimated sb of willman 1 is @xmath59 .",
    "when we utilize the sb , or appropriately - scaled s2 , spectrum as background the fits are not significantly improved in models with an additional emission line , although the upper limits are consistent with the line flux based on the pb - subtracted spectrum . as the sb ( figure 2 ) and s2 spectra overestimate the willman 1 background , and will include a contribution due to the milky way dark matter halo ( plus , possibly significant , additional emission from the outer willman 1 halo in the latter ) , the expectation that the pb - subtracted spectrum is most sensitive for these purposes is confirmed .",
    "notably , the flux is consistent with the narrow region in the mass - mixing - angle plane where the dw neutrino oscillation mechanism produces all of the dark matter ( and where sterile neutrino emission from neutron stars may explain pulsar kicks  see next section ) .",
    "figure 9 shows the predicted flux at each energy @xmath7 assuming dw production of sterile neutrinos of @xmath60 , and @xmath37 .",
    "we compare this with the @xmath58 upper limits derived from monte carlo simulations ( see section 3 ) , and our measurement . even accounting for uncertainties in the dw production rate , and allowing for a factor of four uncertainty in the mass , a fluctuation at this level maps into this narrow region only over @xmath61 kev . at lower energies",
    "the predicted line flux is below our sensitivity , while at higher energies a much stronger feature would be expected .",
    "that is , the likelihood of a marginal feature compatible with the simplest sterile neutrino hypothesis is much less than the likelihood at some random x - ray energy .",
    "upper limits for a line - free spectrum .",
    "the solid and broken lines show the expected line flux from sterile neutrino radiative decay in willman 1 , assuming @xmath37 and taking into account the hadronic uncertainties in production ( asaka et al .",
    "2007 ) , which affect the relation between the mass and the mixing angle corresponding to a given value of @xmath11 .",
    "the dotted curves allows for a factor of two uncertainty in mass in either direction ( @xmath62 ) , _ in addition _ to the spread in possible production rate . ]",
    "we re - examine the _ suzaku _ spectra of the ursa minor and draco `` classical '' milky way dwarf spheroidals to check for consistency with the line flux limits of the 2.5 kev candidate sterile neutrino radiative decay emission line in willman 1 . the projected mass estimate adopted in lkb within the _ suzkau _ spectral source region for ursa",

    "other factors that contribute to a lower background in the willman 1 observation are the lower point source detection threshold ( about 5 times as many point sources are detected ) , the higher concentration of willman 1 that allows us to use a a smaller spectral extraction region , and the ability to pre - filter the particle background ( see section 2 ; the draco observation was conducted in faint , rather than vfaint , data - mode ) .",

    "of course , the gravitational potential wells in dwarf spheroidals are far too shallow ( their observed velocity dispersions corresponding to @xmath21 ev temperatures ) to bind gas hot enough to collisionally ionize s to this degree , and there are no significant sources of photoionization . if hot plasma were somehow responsible for the willman 1 2.5 kev emission line , one would expect much stronger accompanying emission in si - k and fe - l shell emission that is not seen  unless the elemental abundances are highly and uniquely peculiar . when we attempt to fit the willman 1 spectrum with a thermal plasma model ( best fit temperature , @xmath92 kev ) , we find that the 2.5 kev line may be accounted for only if the s / fe abundance ratio exceeds @xmath93 the solar ratio .      the limits based on lyman-@xmath94 forest data @xcite allow up to 40% of dark matter in the form of 5-kev sterile neutrinos produced via dodelson - widrow ( dw ) scenario @xcite",
    ". however , if there is any contribution from the higgs boson decays , the resulting population of relic sterile neutrinos has about three times smaller free - streaming length than the dw population @xcite .",

    "improper subtraction of the pb could conceivably produce artefacts in the subtracted spectrum that may be misinterpreted as a feature .",
    "we address this issue , as follows , by applying an analysis procedure to the willman 1 spectrum along the lines that we implemented in analyzing the _ suzaku _ dwarf spheroidal spectra ( see section 4.2.1 , lkb ) .",
    "we consider the full unsubtracted , and unbinned , spectrum in the 2.2 - 5 kev band .",
    "the reduced - background pb spectrum ( section 2.4 ) is fit by a model consisting of a power - law and two gaussian emission lines with energies corresponding to the brightest au fluorescent features @xcite , and line - widths that are free to vary .",
    "the addition of a line at 2.51 kev does not improve the fit , and the @xmath95 line flux upper limit is @xmath96 .",
    "if we then fit the total ( unsubtracted ) spectrum with the same baseline model , the addition of a line at 2.51 kev improves the fit by @xmath97 and the best - fit line flux of @xmath98 ( @xmath95 errors ) is consistent with the estimate based on the pb - subtracted spectrum .",
    "if we allow the line energy to float , we find energy @xmath99 kev and flux @xmath100 ( @xmath101 errors ) , again consistent with the initial estimate .",
    "the improvement in fit over the baseline model is @xmath102 .",
    "if we then go back and refit the pb spectrum with an additional line with energy fixed at 2.57 kev , we find that the @xmath95 line flux upper limit is @xmath103 , and the inclusion of the line does not improve the fit ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "these considerations indicate that the 2.5 kev feature is not an artefact of inaccurate pb subtraction .",
    "the unbinned pb and total spectra and best fit models are shown in figure 11ab ; the same comparison with the data rebinned ( in the plot only ) is shown along with the two best - fit models in figure 12 .",
    "confidence contours are plotted in figure 13 .              our re - examination of the other x - ray dwarf spheroidal datasets yields an intriguingly similar weak 2.5 kev feature in the _ suzaku _ xis1 spectrum of ursa minor ,",
    "but fails to confirm the presence of an emission line at the expected strength in _ suzaku _ and _ chandra _ data on draco and the _ suzaku _ xis03 spectrum of ursa minor .",
    "@xcite do not detect a feature in either the sculptor or fornax dwarf spheroidals ; although , it is notable that these systems have relatively low mass - to - light ratios @xcite  increasing the possibility of the presence of the diluting effects of an unresolved stellar component ( the former is known to have a population of x - ray binaries ; maccarone et al .",
    "2005 )  a factor that is also an issue in m31 ( see above ) .",
    "detection of a 2.5 kev line from sterile neutrinos is impeded in the most massive dark - matter dominated systems , which are well known to retain hot metal - enriched ( interstellar , intragroup , or intracluster ) gas with line - emission from highly ionized s. such sources of confusion are absent in the extreme baryon - poor faint and ultra - faint dwarf spheroidals , making them the cleanest targets for confirming or refuting the evidence for 5  kev sterile neutrino dark matter uncovered in willman 1 .",
    "that is , the current absence of other positive detections may , in every case , be accommodated with confirmation of the willman 1 provisional detection reported here  given the uncertainties in mass profiles and various other factors discussed in this section .",
    "our measurement lies near the limit of faint source line fluxes attainable with the best current detectors and , even in the most promising targets , the possible presence of sterile neutrinos with the most suitable parameters in terms of viability as a dark matter candidate lie tantalizingly close to the edge of detectability .",
    "it is notable that the willman 1 x - ray observation is unique in that it represents the only deep _",
    "chandra _ exposure of a very high mass - to - light system , so that all sources of competing 2.5 kev line and continuum emission of astrophysical origin are minimized . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamical nature of willman 1 remains unresolved and continues to be investigated @xcite .",
    "additional observations of this  and/or other similar  dwarf spheroidals may be required to settle the question of whether the willman 1 feature is real or spurious .",
    "one can take two different approaches to interpreting the spectral line from a decaying relic particle .",
    "if one assumes dark matter is solely composed of sterile neutrinos , then the number density of particles is determined by the particle mass and the mixing angle is inferred from the line flux .",
    "alternatively , one can relax the assumption equating the relic density and total dark matter density @xcite  e.g. , there may be additional contributing dark matter components .",
    "regardless of any additional physics , sterile neutrinos of a given mass and mixing angle are produced by neutrino oscillations  @xcite at a rate that is calculable and can not be reduced by any unknown high - scale physics .",
    "the contours for the allowed ranges of mass and mixing angle are somewhat different depending on whether the relic sterile neutrino density is assumed to be equal to the measured cosmological density of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "we show the results of both approaches in figure  [ fig : chandra_dm_pulsarkicks ] .",
    "m@xmath6 is assumed @xcite .",
    "the inferred parameters are consistent with the pulsar kick mechanisms based on either resonant ( msw ) or non - resonant production in the cooling neutron star ( see text , kusenko 2009 ) . ]    interpreted as a sterile neutrino radiative decay , the emission line energy and 90% flux limits imply @xmath105 kev , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , where the projected mass in the _ chandra _ beam is normalized to the fiducial value of @xmath108 m@xmath6 .",
    "@xmath109 represents an absolute lower limit to the mixing angle , regardless of the sterile neutrino production mechanism .",
    "if there was some dw production , at least @xmath110% of the dark matter must have been produced in this manner ( based on the minimum production and lower line flux limit ) . if the dw mechanism is responsible for all of the sterile neutrino production , @xmath111 , where the lower ( upper ) limit corresponds to the line flux lower ( upper ) limit and the maximum ( minimum ) production ; and , @xmath112 .",
    "the data is consistent with dw production and @xmath37 ( figure 9 ) for @xmath113 , where the lower ( upper ) limit is derived from the minimum ( maximum ) flux and production . the corresponding mixing angle for minimum",
    "( maximum ) production is @xmath114 .",
    "in fact our best fit flux matches that expected for average dw production and @xmath37 for @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) , which is close to our fiducial mass ( figure 9 ) .",
    "the allowed region may be further circumscribed if combined with previously derived constraints .",
    "limits have been derived using a variety of datasets ( mostly based on _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ data ) , employing a variety of data reduction , background mitigation , and statistical techniques to derive upper limits , taking diverse approaches ( if any ) to account for emission associated with baryons ( see above ) , and depend on different methods for estimates ( and associated uncertainties ) of the dark matter content in the field - of - view .",
    "the limits based on _ chandra _ deep field measurements of the unresolved x - ray background originating in the milky way dark matter halo @xcite are perhaps the most directly comparable in that deep _ chandra _ acis - i data ( some of which was taken in vfaint mode ) was utilized .",
    "these constraints are consistent with dark matter being composed of @xmath117 kev sterile neutrinos produced by the dw mechanism .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations of diffuse emission in the m31 halo are formally inconsistent with our best - fit flux under the same assumptions .",
    "however , taking the uncertainties into account , an ample region of concordance is retained that includes parameters where @xmath37 and non - resonant oscillations are the dominant , or sole , mechanism of sterile neutrino production ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "this interpretation has immediate implications for particle physics and astrophysics .",
    "in particular , supernova physics is altered dramatically by the emission of a 5  kev sterile neutrino that has a mixing angle @xmath118 .",
    "first , the emission is anisotropic , with the direction of anisotropy set by the electron spins polarized in the magnetic field  @xcite . while the overall energy removed by sterile neutrinos with 5  kev mass and @xmath119 is small , the anisotropy in the emission of sterile neutrinos plays a central role in generating the supernova asymmetries .",
    "second , the lepton number , energy , and entropy transport in the cooling neutron star are affected , and an increase in the electron neutrino luminosity can preheat the material in front of the shock wave , adding to the energy of the overall explosion  @xcite .",
    "third , the neutrino - driven kick enhances the convection in front of the neutron star , which causes some energy increase of the shock wave  @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations of this effect show the formation of asymmetric jets with the stronger jet pointing in the direction of the pulsar motion  @xcite .    from the point of view of particle physics , the 5  kev sterile neutrino with a small mixing angle can be accommodated in a seesaw mass matrix that satisfies all the experimental and observational constraints @xcite .",
    "the values inferred from the _ chandra _ observations allow for all dark matter to be produced via neutrino oscillations , so that no additional production mechanism is necessary .",
    "this , however , does not preclude the 5  kev mass from being generated via the higgs mechanism by a vacuum expectation value of an electroweak - scale singlet higgs boson , which may be discoverable by upcoming experiments at the large hadron collider  @xcite .",
    "the x - rays emitted by dark matter decay during the `` dark ages '' could produce a strong enough ionization to enhance the formation of molecular hydrogen , which , in turn , could speed up the formation of the first stars  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding predictions for 21  cm and other observations depend on the knowledge of the particle mass and mixing angle  @xcite that are greatly refined if the dark matter particle has the mass and mixing inferred from _",
    "observations of willman 1 .",
    "finally , there is no doubt that observational cosmology will take advantage of our finding if it is confirmed .",
    "if dark matter emits a narrow spectral line in x - rays , one can hope to map out the three - dimensional dark matter distribution , including the redshift , using future x - ray telescopes such as _ astro - h _   and _ ixo_. such data could be used to study the expansion of the universe on cosmological distance scales .",
    "we presented results of a search for a radiatively decaying dark matter emission line in the _ chandra _ spectrum of the ultra - faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy willman 1 .",
    "@xmath33 upper limits on the line flux over the 0.4 - 7 kev bandpass were translated to an allowed region in the sterile neutrino mass - mixing angle plane for the case where all of the dark matter is composed of sterile neutrinos regardless of how they are produced , and in the more general case where their abundance is not assumed but is calculated under the assumptions that minimize it .",
    "these constraints are consistent with and therefore , given the uncertainties in mass determination , reinforce those derived from previous x - ray analysis of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( lkb , riemer - sorensen & hansen 2009 ) .",
    "we uncovered evidence of an emission line in the willman 1 x - ray spectrum with energy @xmath50 kev and flux @xmath120\\times 10^{-6}\\ { \\rm photons}\\ { \\rm cm}^{-2}\\ { \\rm s}^{-1}$ ] , where the errors are 68% ( 90% ) confidence limits .",
    "this was based on an excess to the continuum measured by fitting the particle - background - subtracted source spectrum , where the vfaint data - mode quiescent background reduction technique was applied .",
    "consistent parameters were found using maximum likelihood fitting to the unbinned , unsubtracted spectrum .",
    "re - examination of _ suzaku _ data of the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal , and _",
    "data on the draco dwarf spheroidal , reveal a possible confirmation in the _ suzaku _ xis1 spectrum of ursa minor , but not in any of the other spectra .",
    "evidence of dark matter radiative decay in willman 1 remains provisional due to the low level of significance , but uncontradicted . in the short term ,",
    "additional x - ray observations of sdss dwarf spheroidals are needed , while future high energy resolution x - ray spectroscopy should prove definitive .",
    "we derive the range of allowed sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle implied by the 90% confidence limits of line energy and flux , assuming that either ( 1 ) dark matter solely consists of sterile neutrinos regardless of how they are produced , or that ( 2 ) they are solely produced by neutrino oscillations regardless of whether the abundance matches that of dark matter as inferred from cosmology .",
    "remarkably , the two allowed regions strongly overlap  that is , the observations are consistent with the narrow region in the mass - mixing - angle plane where neutrino oscillations may produce all of the dark matter ( although it allows for some non - dw production )",
