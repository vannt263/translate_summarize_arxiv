    "the knowledge of these interactions is crucial for a better understanding of the strangeness sector of the hadronic equation of state , in particular , beyond ground state baryon density .",
    "for instance , compact astrophysical objects such as neutron stars might be strongly affected by the presence of hypermatter due to a considerable softening of the hadronic equation of state at very high baryon densities  @xcite , which , however , seems to be in contrast with the recently observed neutron star of about two solar masses  @xcite .",
    "hypernuclear structure provides information around saturation density only , while the production of hypermatter in nuclear reactions induced by heavy ions and by antibaryons covers a broader region in baryon density , isospin asymmetry and single - particle energy  @xcite .",
    "nuclear reactions further can be useful for the formation of exotic hypernuclei and help to understand the limits of the nuclear chart also into the strangeness sector  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the investigation of hypernuclei is important for spectroscopy of conventional nuclei @xcite , since single hyperons bound in finite nuclei do not experience the pauli blocking and thus serve as probes for many - body dynamics .",
    "the hypernucleus is a bound nucleus with one or more nucleons replaced by @xmath0-hyperons .",
    "so far only single-@xmath0 ( or @xmath3 single - strange ) and double-@xmath0 ( or @xmath4 double - strange ) hypernuclei have been found experimentally . in the first case",
    "the physical properties of the hyperon - nucleon interaction can be studied , while in double-@xmath0 hypernuclei also the hyperon - hyperon interaction is accessible .",
    "experimental information on single-@xmath0 hypernuclei is conventionally provided by spectroscopy using pion or kaon beams , by high energy protons , and by electroproduction  @xcite . in these cases",
    "the structure of rather cold hypernuclei at ground state density is explored . in reactions induced by intermediate energy heavy - ion beams ,",
    "however , a quite different scenario is encountered : hyperons are produced at densities higher than saturation , and then can be captured by nuclear fragments . therefore , in such reactions one might explore indirectly the high density behaviour of the hyperon - nucleon interaction .",

    "in contrast to heavy - ion collisions and proton - induced reactions , where strangeness production proceeds mainly through meson rescattering and resonance decay , here the main production mechanism for hypernuclei arises from @xmath11- and @xmath12-annihilation .",
    "this channel has very high cross section at panda energies , i.e. , @xmath13 mb , which is almost a factor of @xmath14 higher than the corresponding @xmath15 cross section  @xcite . according to the panda proposals ,",
    "double - strange hypernuclei are expected to be produced through the capture of primary cascade particles ( @xmath2 ) into secondary targets , which then are converted inside a nuclear fragment into two @xmath0 hyperons .",
    "recently we have studied the formation of s=-1 single - strange hypernuclei in heavy - ion collisions and high energy proton - induced reactions  @xcite .",
    "our theoretical estimates on the production probability of strangeness carrying nuclei seem to be compatible with the hyphi experiment  @xcite and are also close to other theoretical analyses  @xcite . here",

    "however , the conventional rmf approach fails to describe empirical data on antiproton production in @xmath30-nucleus and nucleus - nucleus interactions by imposing only g - parity @xcite .",
    "this problem has been related to a linear energy dependence of the proton - nucleus optical potential , which is not consistent with empirical data and results to a divergent linear behavior for the antinucleon - nucleus interactions .",

    "however , an answer on the question , whether the cascade particles give the major contribution to the formation of double - strange hypernuclei or not , depends on two issues .",
    "first , the @xmath2 particles have to be slow in order to be captured inside the residual system , otherwise the relativistic mean - field , in particular its lorentz - vector component , is too repulsive and the resulting effective potential too shallow for a capture into a bound state .",
