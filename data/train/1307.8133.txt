    "flow of granular media can be difficult to predict and challenging to model because of the inherent complexity of the collective motion of large numbers of particles . yet",
    ", granular flows can sometimes be modeled using a continuum approximation , for example , as in the case of flow in a rotating tumbler  @xcite and flow down an inclined plane or heap  @xcite .",
    "the usual assumption in these geometries is that spanwise particle motion is primarily diffusive and averages to zero .",
    "however , there are situations where spanwise flow occurs . for example , in a partially - filled , long cylindrical tumbler rotating about its axis , endwall friction causes pathlines to curve near the endwalls  @xcite . in the case of bidisperse particles ,",
    "this out - of - plane flow can drive axial segregation and initiate axial band formation @xcite .",
    "and @xmath0 denote the rotation speed and flowing layer velocity , respectively , and @xmath1 is the dynamic angle of repose of the free surface with respect to horizontal . ]        here we consider flow in partially - filled three - dimensional ( 3d ) tumblers , such as spherical tumblers [ fig .",
    "[ figmodel](a ) ] @xcite , rotating with angular velocity @xmath2 about a horizontal axis @xmath3 that intersects the tumbler at its `` poles . ''",
    "our interest derives from the desire to extend the understanding of granular flow in quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) cases  @xcite to fully 3d flows .",
    "we consider the situation where the free surface is essentially flat and continuously flowing  @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the surface of the flowing layer maintains a dynamic angle of repose with respect to horizontal @xmath1 which depends on the frictional properties and diameter @xmath4 of the particles , and the rotational speed of the tumbler @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "a simple model of 3d flow in a spherical tumbler  @xcite assumes that flow in each plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation is essentially that of a two - dimensional circular slice of the appropriate diameter , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figmodel](a ) . in this reduced quasi-2d geometry , particles enter the upstream end of the thin , rapidly flowing layer from the fixed bed ( the region of particles in solid body rotation ) , flow downslope , and return to the fixed bed following the idealized streamlines shown in fig .  [ figmodel](b ) .",
    "the streamwise velocity profile in the flowing layer decreases approximately linearly with depth  @xcite , while the portion of the ` solid body ' region nearest the flowing layer exhibits a much slower creeping motion  @xcite .    despite the attractiveness of its simplicity , there are indications that the 2d flow assumption is imperfect",
    ". simulations of monodisperse flow in a partially - filled spherical tumbler  @xcite indicate a slight out - of-@xmath5-plane curvature in the trajectories of surface particles .",
    "asymmetries between the upstream and downstream portions of the curved trajectories manifest as axial drift . unlike a partially - filled cylindrical tumbler  @xcite",
    ", the trajectory curvature can not be directly attributed to frictional endwall effects .",
    "rather , the curved particle trajectories appear to be related to the relative curvature of the tumbler walls to the surface of spherical particles as the paths of large particles curve more than the paths of small particles for the same tumbler diameter .    in this paper , axial drift",
    "is examined in experiment and simulation .",
    "experimentally , particles are tracked on the surface and along the tumbler wall to measure the axial drift .",
    "cross sections of the tumbler are also imaged to visualize the axial motion of colored particles within the bed .",
    "discrete element method ( dem ) simulations are performed to obtain particle trajectories and velocities to understand the axial drift in more detail .",
    "similar axial drift occurs in both experiment and simulation over a range of tumbler and particle parameters , confirming the robust nature of the phenomenon .    , vs.  normalized axial position , @xmath6 , for @xmath7 in a spherical tumbler .",
    "curves extend from the equator to the maximum axial position of the free surface .",
    "the region between vertical dashed lines represents the initial position of the tracer band ( @xmath8 ) in experiments and simulations . ]",
    "the tumblers in these experiments were clear acrylic spheres rotated at constant angular velocity about a horizontal @xmath3 axis by a motor . in the band drift experiments ,",
    "a @xmath9-cm diameter tumbler was filled to a fill fraction ( by volume ) varying between @xmath10 and @xmath11 with @xmath12 mm diameter soda - lime glass beads ( siliglit deco beads , sigmund lindner gmbh , germany ) and rotated at @xmath13 rpm . a tracking band [ fig .",
    "[ figcrosssection](a ) ] was formed by filling the space between two thin partitions ( at @xmath14 cm and @xmath15 cm ) with light colored beads and filling the exterior with dark colored beads . to reduce electro - static interactions between particles and the wall ,",
    "the inside of the tumbler was either wiped with an antistatic wipe ( staticide , acl inc . ,",
    "chicago , il ) or treated with an antistatic spray ( sp 610 , sprayon inc . ,",
    "cleveland , oh ) prior to filling . to reduce inter - particle static",
    "charging when the relative humidity was below 50% , a small amount of deionized water ( typically 2 - 5@xmath16l ) was allowed to evaporate in the sealed tumbler to increase the relative humidity above 50% .    to view cross sections on @xmath17 planes perpendicular to the flow direction in experiment after tumbling ,",
    "the grain bed was immobilized by pouring hot gelatin into the tumbler .",
    "once the gelatin cooled to room temperature , the tumbler was placed in a freezer to set the gelatin .",
    "the tumbler was then cut in half along the meridional plane and photographed .",
    "additional parallel planes behind the initial cut were exposed by carefully removing particles with a scraper .",
    "two sets of images were obtained for each experiment from the halves created by the initial cut .    before presenting the experimental results",
    ", we note that the time between surface particle passes through the flowing layer @xmath18 is always less than the tumbler rotation period @xmath19 for @xmath20 and , as a consequence , the number of particle passes ( cycles ) is always greater than the number of tumbler rotations .",
    "this occurs because the bed surface in any quasi-2d slice perpendicular to the rotation axis subtends an angle , @xmath21 measured with respect to the rotation axis ( fig .",
    "[ figtime ] inset ) . ignoring the relatively much shorter time spent in the flowing layer",
    "( see appendix  [ restime ] ) , @xmath22 .",
    "for all @xmath23 @xmath24 and thus @xmath25 varies with axial position since the surface of the particle bed does not extend to the poles .",
    "figure  [ figtime ] shows the predicted value of @xmath26 as a function of normalized axial position @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the tumbler radius . for fixed @xmath27 @xmath26 increases with @xmath29 while for fixed @xmath29 @xmath26 decreases ( increases ) with @xmath6 for @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) . at @xmath32 @xmath26 @xmath33",
    "is independent of @xmath34    .[simtable ] dem simulation parameters [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "the negligible flowing layer passage time assumption made in sec .",
    "ii was verified by experiments and simulations with @xmath35 mm colored tracer bead in a bed of @xmath36 mm beads .",
    "a larger tracer was used because it remained at the top of the flowing layer and at the tumbler wall when in solid body rotation , which allowed the time spent in solid body rotation to be measured .",
    "@xmath37 was used because @xmath26 should be independent of @xmath3 for this fill fraction .",
    "the relative flowing layer time , @xmath38 , and the solid body rotation residence time , @xmath26 , were measured for 20 tumbler rotations .",
    "results in table  [ timetable ] indicate that @xmath26 is slightly longer than the predicted value of 0.5 for @xmath32 probably due to a small degree of internal slip and slight rearrangement  @xcite of particles in the fixed bed as the tumbler rotates .",
    "@xmath38 is about an order of magnitude less than @xmath26 .",
    "it increases slightly with rotation rate , which is probably a result of the thicker flowing layer at these high flow rates . from simulations ,",
    "the flowing layer at the equator was 1.3 times thicker at 30rpm than at 3rpm , resulting in a twofold increase in flowing layer passage time .",
    "flowing layer passage times can also be estimated from experiments in a quasi-2d circular tumbler by jain et al .",
    "@xcite and from the model of christov et al .",
    "@xcite ; both methods give values similar to those obtained in tracer experiments ( table  [ timetable ] ) .",
    "for the dem simulations , a standard linear - spring and viscous damper force model  @xcite was used to calculate the normal force between two contacting particles : @xmath39\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$ ] , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the particle overlap and the relative velocity ( @xmath42 ) of contacting particles @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively ; @xmath45 is the unit vector in the direction between particles @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; @xmath46 is the reduced mass of the two particles ; @xmath47 $ ] is the normal stiffness and @xmath48 is the normal damping , where @xmath49 is the collision time and @xmath50 is the restitution coefficient  @xcite .",
    "a standard tangential force model  @xcite with elasticity was implemented : @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the relative tangential velocity of two particles  @xcite , @xmath53 is the tangential stiffness , and @xmath54 is the net tangential displacement after contact is first established at time , @xmath55 .",
    "the velocity - verlet algorithm  @xcite was used to update the position , orientation , and linear and angular velocity of each particle .",
    "tumbler walls were modeled as both smooth surfaces ( smooth walls ) and as compositions of bonded particles ( rough walls ) .",
    "both wall conditions have infinite mass for calculation of the collision force between the tumbling particles and the wall .",
    "rough walls were used exclusively for double cone tumbler simulations .",
    "most spherical tumbler simulations used smooth walls , though a few used rough walls for comparison  both wall types produced similar results . to characterize the mean velocity field , the spherical computational domain was divided into cubical bins of width @xmath56 . in most cases , this bin width adequately resolves the flowing layer , as the thickness of the flowing layer typically ranges from @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "local flow properties were obtained by averaging values for all particles in each bin every 100 time steps for a total of 15s of physical time .",
