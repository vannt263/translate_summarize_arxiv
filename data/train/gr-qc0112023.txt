    "in recent numerical simulations @xcite of gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field in 2 + 1 dimensions with negative cosmological constant @xmath3 , threshold solutions were observed , exhibiting features characteristic of critical collapse @xcite , namely power - law scaling and continuous self - similarity ( css ) .",
    "it has been argued by garfinkle @xcite that this behavior is governed by an exact css solution of the @xmath4 theory . to show that such a solution is indeed a critical solution , one should investigate near - critical configurations to see whether they describe black hole formation .",
    "however , as a strictly negative cosmological constant is necessary for the existence of black holes in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite , one should first extend the garfinkle solutions to @xmath5 , a hard problem which has not yet been solved in generality .    in this talk",
    ", we shall present a new class of @xmath6 css solutions which can be extended to @xmath5 , and show that a class of nearby solutions do indeed describe black hole formation . after reviewing the garfinkle solutions",
    ", we describe the new css solutions and their extension to @xmath7 quasi - css solutions .",
    "we then perform the linear perturbation analysis in the background of these threshold solutions .",
    "imposing appropriate boundary conditions , we obtain discrete modes describing black hole formation , and discuss the determination of the critical exponent .",
    "the einstein - massless scalar field equations with cosmological constant are g _ - g _ = _ _ - ( 1/2 ) g_^ _ , ^2= 0 . assuming rotational symmetry",
    ", we make the double null ansatz : ds^2 = e^2(u , v)dudv -r^2(u , v)d^2 , = ( u , v ) .",
    "the field equations then take the form & r_,uv = ( /2 ) r e^2 , & + & 2_,uv = ( /2 ) e^2 - _ , u_,v , & + & 2_,u r_,u -r_,uu = r_,u^2 , & + & 2_,v r_,v -r_,vv = r_,v^2 , & + & 2r_,uv + r_,u_,v + r_,v_,u = 0 & .",
    "assuming @xmath6 , garfinkle found @xcite the following exact css solutions ds^2 & = & -a()^c^2dd - ( + ) ^2d^2 , + & = & -2c ( + ) , depending on an arbitrary constant @xmath8 and a scale @xmath9 .",
    "these solutions are continuously self - similar with homothetic vector @xmath10 and , for @xmath11 , agree well near the singularity with numerical results of @xcite .",
    "however , it has not been possible up to now to extend them to solutions of the full @xmath5 equations with both css behaviour near the singularity , and the correct ads behaviour at spatial infinity .    from the garfinkle class of css solutions ( [ garm])-([garp ] ) , we derive a new class of css solutions by an infinite boost @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , arriving at ds^2 = -|a(-/)^c^2dd - ^2 d^2 .",
    "these new solutions obviously inherit the css behaviour of the original garfinkle solutions .",
    "the transformation to new null coordinates @xmath15 , @xmath16 leads to the simpler form of these solutions ds^2 = dudv - ( -u)^2 d^2 , = -c(-u ) ( @xmath17 ) , which may be checked to solve exactly eqs .",
    "( [ ein1])-([phi ] ) .    the generic solution ( [ new2 ] )",
    "has four killing vectors .",
    "while this spacetime is devoid of scalar curvature singularities , the study of geodesic motion shows that for @xmath18 only radial geodesics can be continued through the null line @xmath19 , while nonradial geodesics terminate at the singular point @xmath20 . on the other hand , for @xmath21 nonradial geodesics terminate on the null line @xmath19 .",
    "so the @xmath22 solution is an extreme solution separating the @xmath23 solutions with a point singularity from the @xmath21 solutions with a null line singularity .",
    "now we proceed to extend the second class of @xmath6 css solutions ( [ new2 ] ) to exact quasi - css solutions of the full @xmath5 equations ( the self - similarity being then broken by the cosmological constant ) .",
    "we make the ansatz ds^2 = e^2(x)dudv - ( -u)^2 ^ 2(x)d^2 , = -c(-u ) + ( x ) ( x uv ) .",

    "to ascertain whether the quasi - css solutions of the preceding section are threshold solutions for black hole formation , we study their linear perturbations , along the lines of the analysis of @xcite . the relevant time parameter in critical collapse being the retarded time @xcite @xmath26 ,",

    "so , up to gauge transformations , the general solution of this system depends only on two integration constants , which should be determined by enforcing appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the three boundaries of our quasi - css solutions are @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 ) , and @xmath38 ( the ads boundary ) . on the singular boundary @xmath19",
    ", it seems natural to impose that the perturbed metric component @xmath39 does not diverge too quickly , which would conflict with the linear approximation .",

    "this last condition ensures regularity on the line @xmath36 .",

    "it turns out that this last condition is always satisfied up to gauge transformations .",
    "this is due to the fact that the perturbed scalar field becomes negligible at spatial infinity , so that the asymptotic behavior is that of @xmath25 ( the effect of gauge transformations is to shift the value @xmath41 for which the ads boundary is attained ) .    to enforce our boundary conditions on the line @xmath36 ,",
    "it is enough to know the behavior of the solutions of the linearized system near @xmath42 .",

    "black hole formation is characterized by the appearance of a central singularity hidden by an apparent horizon",
    ". the definition of these notions can be quite ambiguous in linearized perturbation theory . for our present purpose",
    "we shall identify the central singularity with the coordinate singularity of the linearized perturbed metric = e^2r = ( -u)^e^2(x)[(x ) + ( -u)^-((x ) + 2(x)(x ) ) ] = 0 , and define the apparent horizon by r_,v = ( -u)^1+( + ( -u)^- ) = 0 .    in the case of the solution ( [ solb ] ) , for @xmath54",
    ", a spacelike coordinate singularity appears at @xmath36 , hidden behind a preexisting spacelike apparent horizon , which seems to be eternal ( fig .",
    "1 ) . such a situation does not seem to correspond to collapse , but rather to a static configuration . indeed , consider the exact static solution of the einstein equations ( [ ein1])-([phi ] ) with @xmath6 @xcite ds^2 = a r^c^2(dt^2-dr^2)-r^2d^2 , = cr .",
    "putting @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and expanding in powers of the small parameter @xmath28 , we get to first order ds_0 ^ 2 & = & |a(1-c^2(-u)^--1)dudv-(-u)^2 ( 1-c^2(-u)^--1)^2d^2 , + & = & -c(-u ) + c(-u)^--1x , which agrees with the first order expansions ( [ pr])-([pp ] ) for @xmath6 and @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 .",

    "the btz metric can be rewritten in the double - null form @xcite ds^2 = 1(1+uv/4l^2)^2[dudv - ( u+(m/4)v)^2d^2 ] , which corresponds to the first order expansion ( [ pr])-([pp ] ) for @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ( the linearized solution is exact in this case ) .",
    "consider now the second solution ( [ solb ] ) .",
    "for @xmath66 , a coordinate singularity and an apparent horizon , both spacelike , appear simultaneously at @xmath36 , and converge towards the ads boundary @xmath67 for a finite value @xmath68 of the horizon radius ( fig .",
    "the fact that this apparent horizon is born together with the singularity suggests that it is not automatically regular .",
    "indeed , the curvature invariant r + 6= 4e^-2_,u _ , v , evaluated on the apparent horizon , generically diverges on the original null singularity @xmath19 because @xmath69 .",
    "so the apparent horizon can be regular at birth only if e^-2_,u|_ah(x=0 ) = 0 , which leads to an eigenvalue equation relating @xmath49 and @xmath70 .",
    "while there is some ambiguity in the linearization of ( [ regb ] ) , it seems to lead @xcite to a single solution @xmath52 , @xmath71 .",

    "we obtain for the preferred value @xmath83 the critical exponent = 2/5 .",
    "this differs from the two conflicting values ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) found in the numerical analyses of @xcite , but is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we have constructed a one - parameter ( @xmath70 ) family of exact time - dependent solutions to the einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant and a massless scalar field as source .",
    "these solutions are continuously self - similar near the singularity , and asymptotically ads at spatial infinity .",
    "we have then analyzed the linear perturbations of these solutions , and discussed the subtle question of boundary conditions .",
    "these led to two possible growing modes .",
    "the first mode , ( [ solb ] ) , is characterized by the presence of a presumably eternal apparent horizon .",
    "this is simply the linearization of the static btz black hole in the sourceless case , and very probably of static singular solutions in the general coupled case .",
    "the second mode , ( [ sola ] ) , exhibits the characteristic features of black hole formation , i.e. the simultaneous appearance of a spacelike singularity and its shielding apparent horizon , which then expands up to a finite size .",
    "the condition of regularity at birth of this apparent horizon selects a unique value of the parameter @xmath70 , leading to a value of the critical exponent which is of the order of the values derived from the numerical simulations .",
    "while these results are rather satisfactory , we think that further analytical work on this simple 2 + 1 dimensional model should further clarify the situation and help us to understand better the phenomenon of black hole formation ."
