    "the concepts of momentum and position set together on an equal footing define what is known today as phase space @xcite , geometrically a differentiable manifold @xmath0 endowed with a symplectic form @xmath1 ( nondegeneracy could be relaxed @xcite@xcite , but here we keep to the symplectic case ) .",
    "this generalizes hamilton s formalism , as presented in standard textbooks @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "usually , however , the phase space is first treated as an euclidean @xmath2-space , or even a cotangent bundle , with canonical coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "while hamilton s equation can be generically written down for each real differentiable function on any symplectic manifold , other important and familiar features of the canonical formalism do not always extend in an obvious fashion .",
    "furthermore , although darboux s theorem allows for a local canonical coordinatization of general symplectic manifolds , this is not always the most convenient one to use .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have a formalism which takes into account the specific geometry of the phase space , explicitly , as a further step of the `` geometrical revenge '' in dynamics @xcite .",
    "actually , the importance of considering nontrivial geometries can be seen from many different perspectives .",
    "although the law of inertia sets euclidean geometry in a priviledged status , once a system is subject to nontrivial constraints its proper phase space geometry ceases to be trivial , generically @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "similarly , for a system which is invariant under a group of symmetries , it is often possible to eliminate redundant degrees of freedom and the reduced phase space is also generally nontrivial @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "alternatively , not to mention relativistic contexts , one may be interested in the classical limit of quantum systems , which are non - euclidean , as spin systems @xcite@xcite .",
    "equivalently , it is convenient to have formalisms of classical dynamics intimately connected to some important representations used in quantum mechanics . for instance , coherent states @xcite@xcite or , more pertinent to this work at hand , the `` center representation '' of operators ( cartesian weyl symbols ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "again , it is desirable to have these `` semiclassical '' formulations in nontrivial geometries , but this requires previously well defined classical formalisms .    particularly , we need well defined generating functions for finite canonical transformations .",
    "when @xmath0 is the cotangent bundle over a configuration space @xmath4 , these functions naturally take their values on @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath0 is a khler manifold @xcite@xcite , whose metric and symplectic form are related via its complex structure , one can define generating functions which are bi - holomorphic on @xmath6 , in which case the trajectories are complex . despite the utility of the complex and the configuration space actions in treating a variety of problems , we can greatly benefit from a formalism leading to actions which are real differentiable functions on nontrivial symplectic manifolds , in relationship to the real hamiltonian flows obtained from a real variational principle .    here",
    "we present such a formalism .",
    "this work is a generalization on concepts developed for euclidean spaces @xcite@xcite , or for linearized neighborhoods of general symplectic manifolds @xcite , dating back to the original work of poincar @xcite .",
    "the generating functions are real functions on @xmath0 itself and not on a pair of local lagrangian coordinates .",
    "an argument of one such function , @xmath7 , can be viewed as the `` center '' of the canonical transformation @xmath8 which the function generates implicitly .",
    "the corresponding variational principle states that , for an appropriate family of paths @xmath9\\rightarrow m$ ] whose endpoints are `` centered '' on @xmath10 , the action @xmath11 is stationary for a classical trajectory . here",
    ", @xmath12 is the symplectic area between the curve @xmath13 and the geodesic arc , centered on @xmath10 , returning from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "the restriction on the full foregoing theory is that @xmath0 be a symmetric symplectic space @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath0 admits of a complete affine connection such that every point @xmath7 is the isolated fixed point of an involutive symplectomorphism which coincides with geodesic inversion at @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly , the above formulation of the variational principle is invariant at least with respect to general transformations on @xmath0 preserving the affine connection and the symplectic form .",
    "the generalization from flat to nonflat symmetric symplectic spaces starts with the notion of double phase space , @xmath16 @xcite@xcite .",
    "while in the flat case we define the reflection - translation group , from which the flat theory develops ( @xmath17 2 ) , the equivalent construction for nonflat spaces is not enough and we must use the fact that @xmath16 is a symplectic groupoid @xcite@xcite .",
    "then , via a `` symmetric exponential map '' , we view all structures of @xmath16 in ( a subset of ) the tangent bundle over @xmath0 , @xmath18 .",
    "there we define the notion of central groupoid ( @xmath17 3 ) .",
    "the properties of the pullback symplectic form allows us to see the graphs of canonical transformations as lagrangian submanifolds @xmath19 of ( subsets of ) @xmath18 and define , in @xmath17 4 , ( local ) generating functions for finite canonical transformations ( more generally , relations ) , which are real functions on @xmath0 .",
    "such functions generate well defined canonical relations only when @xmath19 is a graph over the zero section of @xmath18 . for canonical transformations",
    ", there is a further graphical condition .",
    "these considerations are discussed in @xmath17 5 .",
    "the composition of two canonical transformations @xmath20 , as generated by such `` central actions '' , is treated in @xmath17 6 . here",
    ", again we find that despite their abstract nature , the rule for composing them is very simple . if @xmath21 is the central action for @xmath22 , the composed central action for @xmath23 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the symplectic area of the geodesic triangle with given midpoints . on general symmetric",
    "symplectic spaces , the importance of this function was first realized in the context of star product quantization @xcite , whose euclidean version has long been well established using the idea of centers and chords @xcite@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the above rule naturally generalizes the result previously obtained on @xmath26 @xcite@xcite . by iterating these compositions , in @xmath17 7 ,",
    "we arrive at the central variational principle by taking the limit of an infinite number of infinitesimal canonical transformations ( @xmath17 8) .",
    "finally we discuss the temporal evolution of such `` finite - time extensions '' of hamiltonians describing , in @xmath17 9 , a central version of the hamilton - jacobi equation and , more generally , their time derivative with respect to any hamiltonian flow , mixing hamilton - jacobi with poisson brackets .",
    "while presenting these concepts we often make use of particular spaces to illustrate the text .",
    "we have focused on the simplest two dimensional cases : the euclidean plane @xmath27 , the torus @xmath28 , the sphere @xmath29 and the noncompact hyperbolic plane @xmath30 .",
    "of course , extending these examples to their cartesian products @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , etc ... is reasonably straightforward and has not been considered here .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the theory in principle applies to generic symmetric symplectic spaces of arbitrary ( even ) dimensions .",
    "consider the euclidean plane @xmath27 , representing the very simplest phase space of a single degree of freedom .",
    "@xmath27 is a group , under vector addition , and we can also identify the group product as a free transitive action of @xmath27 on itself , the translations : @xmath34 .",
    "further , @xmath27 admits a natural involution @xmath35 , which represents a reflection , or rotation by @xmath36 , through the origin . together with the identity transformation this gives an action of @xmath37 on @xmath27 .",
    "we can form the semidirect product : @xmath38 , which is called the reflection - translation group and can also be seen as a normal subgroup of the inhomogeneous symplectic group . then , @xmath39 is the element of @xmath40 which acts as reflection through the point @xmath41 : @xmath42 . @xmath43",
    "satisfy : @xmath44    now , let @xmath45 be such that @xmath46 .",
    "then , @xmath47 is called the center of the pair @xmath48 . actually , @xmath49 , coinciding , for the euclidean metric , with the midpoint of the geodesic arc joining @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "identifying @xmath52 , the transformation @xmath53 is a bijection .",
    "finally , we see how the group of translations on @xmath27 can be interpreted as a composition of pairs : let @xmath54 , @xmath55",
    ". then @xmath56 .",
    "but noticing that the action @xmath57 can be identified by any of the sets @xmath58 uniquely , we can rewrite the composition of translations as : @xmath59    although ( 2.2 ) was derived from the group product on @xmath27 it can be generalized for spaces which are not groups . in other words , we can turn the argument around and identify ( 2.2 ) as the fundamental algebraic structure on @xmath60 .",
    "this introduces the concept of groupoid .",

    "part of the following theory , namely the local definition of central generating functions ( @xmath17 4 ) , can be developed on general symplectic manifolds @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",

    "we should note that , with greater care , the above rules can be generalized to multiple mixed compositions of central actions and , even more generally , central relations whenever meaningful .",
    "corollary 7.1 generalizes a previous result on @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "we remark that some of the above discussion regarding composition of midpoint triangles , in more general symmetric symplectic spaces , has been approached independently from the point of view of associativity for star products @xcite .",

    "then , as with spherical triangles , a near - bijection between the sets of vertices and midpoints allows for a unique definition of the quadrilateral geometry either way , i.e. each quadrilateral is uniquely determined by its vertices or its midpoints ( with a few exceptions ) and the only restrictions on the latter derive from the restricted groupoid @xmath586 .",

    "using lemma 7.1 , we obtain this simplest composition of three central actions on @xmath30 .",
    "see appendix for a more detailed analysis on these quadrilateral geometries .",
    "besides providing explicit equations for compositions of three central actions , the previous discussions further illustrate some kinds of constraints which the midpoints , or centers ( the arguments of the composing actions ) are subject to . in this respect ,",
    "the euclidean plane presents the feature that , when the number of composing actions is even , no restrictions apply , but when the number is odd , there is a degeneracy in the determination of the @xmath891-polygon from its midpoints , corresponding to a linear functional restriction @xmath892 on the arguments of the composing central actions . for the torus , one must further add the groupoid restrictions .",
    "on the other hand , in the nonflat cases studied , such a degeneracy is an exception and its corresponding extra constraint is not present .",
    "when considering only those polygons which can be obtained by iterated ( standard ) central groupoid compositions , there is a near - bijection between the sets of midpoints and vertices . on @xmath30 ,",
    "intrinsic restrictions on the midpoints exist , though , which show explicitly in the midpoint area function , whatever the number of composing actions . on @xmath29 , only the ( standard )",
    "central groupoid restrictions apply , in every case .",
    "another way to view degeneracies and extra constraints is the following : let @xmath893 be a candidate for the set of midpoints for an @xmath871-polygon on @xmath0 .",
    "also , for each @xmath894 , let @xmath895 be the corresponding involution whose fixed point is @xmath894 .",

    "the exception , in both cases , is when @xmath902 and for these sets of points the corresponding circumscribed polygon is not uniquely defined by the midpoints , but so is its area .",

    "again , this previous analysis can be adapted to @xmath30 , with care ( refer to @xcite for hyperbolic geometry and trigonometry ) .",
    "on @xmath30 we do nt have problems of antipodals or sign choices , since @xmath882 , always . on the other hand , the analogous to ( 6.8 ) , namely ( 6.10 ) ,",
    "is well defined only when ( 6.11 ) is satisfied .",
    "but once @xmath1129 is well defined , we go through the argument backwards from @xmath1130 , to see that the triangle is also well defined .",
    "see @xcite for alternative discussion .    _ quadrilateral computations _ :",
    "again we proceed in the spherical case and later adapt the hyperbolic formulas .",
    "consider a short quadrilateral with vertices @xmath22 and midpoints @xmath1131 , s.t .",
    "@xmath1132 , @xmath1133 .",
    "this means that not only the sides , but also the diagonals are short .",
    "now , denote by @xmath476 the midpoint of the diagonal @xmath1134 and by @xmath1135 its half length .",
    "similarly , denote by @xmath1136 .",
    "then , each of the triangles @xmath1137 and @xmath1138 are uniquely determined by their midpoints @xmath1139 and @xmath1140 , which shall be denoted by @xmath1141 and @xmath1142 , respectively , with the same notation referring to their respective areas .",
    "further , we denote @xmath1143 . from the triangular analysis , we know that @xmath1144 , @xmath1145 . similarly for the other partition , @xmath1146 , @xmath1147 , where @xmath1148 distance @xmath1149 , @xmath1150 being its midpoint , and so on .",
    "therefore , @xmath1151 these equations generalize the parallelogram relation on the plane , @xmath1152 , but contrary to the plane , they impose no constraint on the midpoints . to compensate for this fact , in the spherical case",
    "the 4 midpoints uniquely determine the area as well as the specific geometry of the short quadrilateral .",
    "in other words @xmath1153 and similarly for @xmath1150 . to see this ,",
    "let s denote @xmath1154 .",
    "@xmath1155 , @xmath1156 . also , we denote by @xmath111 the involution through @xmath10 and consider the element of @xmath566 defined as @xmath1157 . similarly , @xmath1158 .",
    "now , for any element @xmath1159 , consider the vector field @xmath1160 defined by @xmath1161 iff @xmath1162 s.t . @xmath1163 .",
    "then , the condition which guarantees that triangles @xmath1141 and @xmath1142 compose into a quadrilateral @xmath1164 can be written as @xmath1165 .",
    "but , @xmath1166 only if the pole @xmath1167 of @xmath1168 lies in the polar line of @xmath1169 , which is defined as the orthogonal geodesic to @xmath1170 , at @xmath476 .",
    "thus , the first condition obtained is that @xmath1171 and @xmath1172 be collinear .",
    "that is , @xmath1173=0 $ ] .",
    "in fact , we have more : @xmath1174 , @xmath1175 .",
    "therefore @xmath1176=0 $ ] .",
    "we can thus write @xmath1177 . further : denoting @xmath1178distance @xmath1179 and @xmath1180distance @xmath1181 , we have @xmath1182 , but since @xmath1183 and @xmath1184 , it follows that @xmath1185 .",
    "then , we get : @xmath1186 . the sign choices must be made with care , but for small convex quadrilaterals we take the @xmath1090 choice twice . in this case , with @xmath1187 , we have that @xmath1188 .",
    "analogous equations hold for @xmath1189 .",
    "we have fixed the geometry of the small convex quadrilateral uniquely from the midpoints @xmath1190 , as mentioned earlier .",
    "the exception is when @xmath1191 , but now , contrary to the euclidean plane , this is really the exception , not the rule . as for the area , from ( 6.8 ) we have @xmath1192 .",
    "then , in this simpler case , denoting the quadrilateral area by @xmath840 , we get @xmath1193 , @xmath1194 here we have restricted to convex quadrilaterals decomposed in small triangles ( area @xmath1195 ) .",
    "greater care is needed for the sign choices in the expression of @xmath1196 , otherwise . as for the restrictions , in this simpler case , by imposing @xmath1197 , we get @xmath1198 , and cyclic . again , in transposing to the hyperbolic plane , we do nt have as many worries about sign choices , however in this case the analogous area function , @xmath1199 , where @xmath1200 , is well defined only when @xmath1201   and , as in the triangular analysis , once this holds the convex quadrilateral exists .",
    "and so on for the general case .",
