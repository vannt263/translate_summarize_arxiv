    ", the bicep2 claimed that they discovered @xmath10 after foreground subtraction with @xmath11 disfavored at @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the large value of @xmath13 claimed by the bicep2 implies a large - field inflation because of the lyth bound  @xcite . by the way , the renowned starobinsky model  @xcite is fully consistent with the planck data by predicting a very small tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath14 , being a large - field inflationary model also .",
    "there are some arguments in the literature  @xcite that the bicep2 collaboration underestimated the foreground , so that @xmath15 may still be consistent with the data .",
    "therefore , the inflationary models with @xmath16 are still alive in the present situation .",
    "the actual value of @xmath13 is going to be established by new observations in a not so distant future .    under such circumstances , we are interested in embedding the inflationary models consistent with current observations into a more general framework motivated by particle physics and a fundamental theory of quantum gravity such as superstrings or m - theory .",
    "it is natural to consider supergravity  @xcite for that purpose because ( i ) supergravity emerges as the low - energy effective action of superstrings , and ( ii ) the energy scale of inflation is higher than the electroweak scale but is lower than the planck scale where some unknown uv effects may come in .",
    "we pursue _ minimal _ realizations of inflation in supergravity , by minimizing a number of the matter d.o.f . involved .",
    "describing inflation and , in particular , a large field or chaotic inflation  @xcite in supergravity is known to be _ non - trivial _ , because of the presence of the exponential factor and the negatively definite term in the @xmath0-type scalar potential . a shift symmetry of the khler potential plays the crucial role in the model building of chaotic inflation in supergravity  @xcite . in those pioneering papers",
    "yet another chiral superfield ( sometimes called the ( s)goldstino or polonyi superfield ) of the @xmath17-charge @xmath18 , with the vanishing vacuum expectation value , was introduced to allow a positively definite inflationary scalar potential .",
    "later on , some extensions of that idea with more general chaotic inflationary potentials were introduced in supergravity in refs .",
    "a different approach for inflation in supergravity with vector or tensor supermultiplets was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was extended to embed arbitrary scalar potentials in refs .",
    "all those methods employ the second superfield , in addition to that containing inflaton .",
    "inflation with a single superfield , or `` sgoldstino inflation '' , was previously studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , and it was concluded that a large - field inflation is virtually impossible in that case @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , new models with a nilpotent chiral goldstino superfield were proposed  @xcite , which lead to the standard volkov - akulov action for goldstino in nonlinearly realized supersymmetry , and a large field inflation is possible .",
    "though those models have only one dynamical complex scalar , their fermionic sectors are much more complicated . in this paper",
    "we adopt the standard ( linearly realized ) supergravity , with only one chiral ( inflaton ) superfield , eluding the known no - go statements .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that there is another minimal scenario in which inflation is driven by gravitino condensation  @xcite , though with the use of a dilaton chiral superfield in conformal supergravity , in order to make gravitino lighter than the planck scale .    in our previous short paper  @xcite we proposed some new supergravity models , realizing a large field inflation and extending the quadratic  @xcite and the starobinsky  @xcite models , by using a single ( inflaton ) chiral superfield only , in the standard supergravity .",
    "the required degrees of freedom , other than those of the standard supergravity including graviton and gravitino , were reduced by half from those available in the literature where either an extra chiral  @xcite or an extra vector  @xcite superfield are required , in addition to the inflaton supermultiplet . a discovery of the fact that a large field inflation is possible in supergravity with a _ single _",
    "chiral superfield was exciting , though the scalar potential , which we obtained in a very straightforward way , was not very transparent or illuminating enough , in contrast to the simple scalar potentials of refs .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "the reason is that the suitable khler potentials and superpotentials were found by a trial and error procedure in ref .",
    "@xcite . moreover ,",
    "_ supersymmetry _ ( susy ) was broken in the vacuum at the inflationary scale in some of the models presented in ref .",
    "though it is not necessarily a problem , it may be inconsistent with the low - energy susy scenario incorporating the gauge coupling unification and reducing the hierarchy problem of scalar masses .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a new , special and much larger class of the minimal models , employing a single chiral superfield , which ( i ) lead to very simple and ( almost ) arbitrary scalar potentials , and ( ii ) preserve susy at the end of inflation .",
    "we show that it is possible to get a single field scalar potential , like the one of global susy @xmath0-term , in the proposed class of supergravity models when using the stabilization mechanism to be explained in sec .",

    "[ sec : origin ] we propose a mechanism for the possible origin of the key quartic term in the khler potential via integration of heavy superfields .",
    "in ref .  @xcite our method and results were not practical enough , in order to derive explicit scalar potentials suitable for inflation , because the scalar potential derived from our khler- and super- potentials of supergravity had a complicated form .",
    "one of the technical reasons was the real part @xmath19 that was effectively fixed to a non - zero value @xmath20 .",
    "it is actually more convenient to redefine the superfield so that the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of its leading scalar field component vanishes .",

    "then the scalar potential is greatly simplified to @xmath30 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to its argument , and @xmath31 is the canonically normalized inflaton field . demanding a real function @xmath29 may look like a strong condition , but it is obviously satisfied in the case of a monomial superpotential that is sufficient for the simplest chaotic model with a quadratic potential . on the one hand , even if the reality or phase alignment condition is not the case , inflation could occur with a straightforwardly obtained but a little more complicated scalar potential  . on the other hand , if it is satisfied at a high - energy scale , the functional form of @xmath29 is preserved by the non - renormalization theorem  @xcite .",
    "the superpotential can be viewed as a small explicit breaking of the shift symmetry in the sense of t hooft  @xcite .",
    "hence , one expects the shift symmetry breaking terms to be suppressed by the same scale as the superpotential also in the khler potential due to quantum corrections .",

    "the quartic term in the khler potential plays the key role in stabilization of the non - inflaton scalar of the inflaton superfield in our class of models .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the quartic term may be by assuming its presence at the tree level .",
    "the quartic term respects the shift symmetry , while all kinds of terms allowed by the symmetries of the theory should generically be included into the effective field theory .",
    "the remaining questions are ( i ) how much the quadratic and cubic terms have to be suppressed , and ( ii ) what is the mechanism for their suppression .",
    "it requires a separate investigation .",
    "however , as a preliminary test , we find that small quadratic and/or cubic terms destroy the cancellation of the no - scale type model .",
    "hence , our khler potential should be regarded as a tuned one , in order to suppress the quadratic and cubic terms . without such tuning",

    "though a thorough study of the origin of the quartic term from superstring theory is beyond the scope of this paper , we briefly discuss the possible origin of the quartic term in the qft framework , which serves as an existence proof .    in the following , we consider coupling of the inflaton to other superfields , and",
    "discuss the effective terms to be obtained through integrating out these superfields .",
    "the idea is to give the @xmath102-dependent masses to the other superfields .",

    "the quantum corrected frame function @xmath192 is left .",
    "see appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of the quartic stabilization term for the stabilizer field .",
    "the quartic term must preserve shift symmetry , so we can not introduce a coupling to the superpotential that is holomorphic .",
    "( shift of @xmath54 changes the phase of the superpotential ; @xmath193 collectively denotes other superfields ) .",
    "however , @xmath54 can be moved into the khler potential by a khler transformation , @xmath194 and @xmath195 . ]",
    "therefore , we consider a coupling in the khler potential . let us suppose the following khler potential : @xmath196 where @xmath197 is a function of @xmath198 , and @xmath127 is the kinetic function for other superfields .",
    "if @xmath54 breaks susy , it gives @xmath193 mass by the term like @xmath199 , but we do not want susy to be broken above the inflation scale .",
    "let us take a simple superpotential for @xmath193 , @xmath200 , where @xmath118 is a mass parameter much larger than the inflaton mass .",
    "masses squared divided by the coefficient of the kinetic terms for scalar and spinor particles are approximately @xmath201 and @xmath202 , respectively , in the jordan frame .",
    "then the one - loop correction to the frame function @xmath128 is @xcite @xmath203    after expanding @xmath204 as @xmath205 , one can easily see that the quartic term appears , as well as the higher and lower order terms .",
    "the full expression is long and is not illuminating . the higher order terms do not affect our inflationary dynamics as far as it is expanded around the vev .",
    "the zeroth and first order terms correspond to renormalization of the newton constant and the field .",
    "the coefficients of quadratic and cubic terms can be eliminated at some renormalization scale @xmath206 by tuning @xmath207 and @xmath208 in the non - minimal coupling function @xmath209 .    hence , as was anticipated above , it is possible to obtain the quartic term in @xmath210 from quantum corrections of heavy fields , with some tuning to suppress the unwanted terms .",
