    "little is known about @xmath2 and only recently was it shown that @xmath2 diverges when the dimension @xmath6 tends to infinity ; see @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present article is to establish that @xmath2 is equivalent to @xmath7 as @xmath6 tends to infinity .",
    "in particular , this result shows that @xmath2 has the same principal asymptotic behavior for large @xmath6 as the corresponding critical parameter ( which has been explicitly computed in @xcite ) attached to the percolation of the vacant set of random interlacements on @xmath8-regular trees .",
    "we now describe the model .",
    "precise definitions and pointers to the literature appear in section [ sec1 ] .",
    "random interlacements are made of a cloud of paths , which constitute a poisson point process on the space of doubly infinite @xmath0-valued trajectories modulo time shift , tending to infinity at positive and negative infinite times .",
    "the nonnegative parameter @xmath3 mentioned above plays the role ( roughly speaking ) of a multiplicative factor of the intensity measure of the poisson point process .",

    "we refer the reader to remark  [ rem4.1 ] for more on this matter .",

    "remark [ rem4.1 ] ) that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is another critical value introduced in @xcite .",

    "it is an important and presently unresolved question whether @xmath28 actually holds .",
    "however , it is known that the connectivity function of the vacant set at level @xmath3 , that is , the probability that @xmath10 and a ( distant ) @xmath29 are linked by a path in @xmath18 ( i.e. , the probability of a vacant crossing at level @xmath3 between @xmath10 and @xmath29 ) has a stretched exponential decay in @xmath29 when @xmath3 is bigger than @xmath26 ; see theorem 0.1 of @xcite",

    "the statement corresponding to ( [ 0.6 ] ) for bernoulli percolation is an asymptotic lower bound for the critical probability ( a lower bound , not an upper bound , because the density of @xmath18 decreases with @xmath3 ) , whereas the required lower bound in the bernoulli percolation context follows from a short peierls - type argument ( cf .",
    "@xcite , page 640 , @xcite , page 222 , or @xcite , page 25 ) ; the proof of ( [ 0.6 ] ) for random interlacements is quite involved .",
    "the long - range dependence present in the model is deeply felt .",
    "an important feature of working in high dimension is that the @xmath31- , euclidean and @xmath32-distances all behave very differently on @xmath0 ; see ( [ 1.1 ] ) . at large enough scales ( i.e. , euclidean distance at least @xmath6 ) ,",
    "the green function of the simple random walk `` feels the invariance principle '' and is well controlled by expressions of the type @xmath33 , where @xmath34 does not depend on @xmath6 and stands for the euclidean norm ; see lemma [ lem1.1 ] .",
    "however , at shorter range , the walk feels more of the tree - like nature of the space and the use of bounds involving the @xmath35-distance becomes more pertinent [ cf .",

    "the above dichotomy permeates the proof of ( [ 0.6 ] ) .",
    "we use a modification of the renormalization scheme ( `` for fixed @xmath6 '' ) employed in @xcite .",
    "the renormalization scheme enables us to transform certain local controls on the probability of vacant crossings at level @xmath36 , @xmath37 , small , into controls on the probability of vacant crossings at arbitrary large scales at a bigger level @xmath38 .",
    "the local estimates entering the initial step of the renormalization scheme are developed in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "these involve controls on the existence of vacant crossings moving at @xmath35-distance @xmath39 from a box of side length @xmath40 for the interlacement at level @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath8-regular tree model lurks behind the control of these local crossings .",
    "the key estimates appear in theorem [ theo3.1 ] and corollary [ cor3.4 ] .",
    "these estimates result from an enhanced peierls - type argument involving the consideration of what happens in @xmath42 @xmath35-balls , each having an @xmath35-radius @xmath43 and lying at mutual @xmath31-distances of at least @xmath44 . for this step ,",
    "part of the difficulty stems from the fact that the local estimates need to be strong enough to overcome the combinatorial complexity involved in the selection of the dyadic trees entering the renormalization scheme .",
    "the renormalization scheme is developed in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "it propagates along an increasing sequence of levels @xmath45 , with initial value @xmath46 and limiting value @xmath47 , uniform estimates on the probability of events involving the presence of certain vacant crossings at level @xmath45 . roughly speaking",
    ", these events correspond to the presence in @xmath48 boxes of side length @xmath49 of paths in  @xmath50 .",
    "the boxes can be thought of as the `` bottom leaves '' of a dyadic tree of depth @xmath51 and are well `` spread out '' within a box of side length @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the paths start in each of the @xmath48 boxes of side length @xmath55 and move at euclidean ( and hence @xmath35- ) distance of order @xmath39 from the boxes .",
    "the estimates are conducted uniformly over the possible dyadic trees involved ( cf .",
    "propositions  [ prop2.1 ] and [ prop2.3 ] ) .",
    "the main induction step in the above procedure ( cf .",
    "proposition [ prop2.1 ] ) relies on the sprinkling technique introduced in @xcite to control the long - range interactions .",
    "the rough idea is to introduce more trajectories in the interlacement by letting the levels slightly increase along the convergent sequence  @xmath45 . in this way",
    ", one dominates the long - range dependence induced by trajectories of the interlacement traveling between distant boxes . in the present context , the method uses , in an essential way , quantitative estimates on harnack constants in large euclidean balls when the dimension @xmath6 goes to infinity .",
    "these estimates crucially enter the proof of proposition [ prop2.3 ] .",
    "the bounds on the harnack constants are derived in proposition [ prop1.3 ] with the help of the general lemma  [ lema.2 ] from the , which is an adaptation of lemma 10.2 of grigoryan and telcs  @xcite .",
    "let us now describe how this article is organized .    in section [ sec1 ] ,",
    "we introduce notation and recall several useful facts concerning random walks and random interlacements . an important role is played by the green function bounds ( see lemma [ lem1.1 ] ) and by the bounds on harnack constants ; see proposition [ prop1.3 ] .    in section [ sec2 ] , we develop the renormalization scheme .",
