    "high redshift ( high - z ) sne ia have been observed by several groups : the high - z team @xcite , the supernova cosmology project @xcite , the supernova legacy survey @xcite and the equation of state : supernovae trace cosmic expansion survey @xcite .",
    "however , since wide field observations are required to obtain comparable numbers of sne ia , few have been observed in the intermediate redshift range ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the sdss - ii supernova survey carried out a three year project @xcite to obtain multi - band light curves of sne ia at intermediate redshifts .",

    "the observed cadence was two days minimum for the same sky region .",
    "analysis was conducted in real - time to assign sn candidates for spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "follow - up spectroscopic observations were carried out at a large number of telescopes to determine at least the supernova type and redshift ; the 2.4 m hiltner , the 2.5 m not , the 3.5 m sdss arc , the 3.6 m ntt , the 4.2 m wht , the 8.2 m subaru , the 9.2 m het and the 10 m keck i telescopes .",

    "we used the subaru telescope for follow - up spectroscopic observations of the sn candidates found by the sdss - ii supernova survey for the first two seasons ( years 2005 & 2006 ) .",
    "the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was used in the long - slit mode .",
    "the atmospheric dispersion corrector ( adc ) was used in our observations .",
    "the instrumental dispersions were 1.34  / pix .",
    "we used a 0.8  slit for sn candidates and a 2.0  slit for spectroscopic standard stars .",
    "the pixel scale was 0.104  and the data were read out with three pixel binning in the spatial direction . in order to obtain spectra in as wide a wavelength range as possible , we observed red and blue sides separately with different sets of grisms and filters .",
    "we obtained a red side spectrum first to identify the `` siii  @xmath56355 '' feature which characterize sne ia and then a blue side spectrum unless the weather was bad or the observing time was limited .",
    "sn candidates were observed at the time when they were as close to zenith as possible and above an elevation of 30@xmath6 , so that they suffered the least from atmospheric absorption .    for year 2005 , we adopted the following grating and filter combinations for the blue and the red sides ; ( i ) 300 line mm@xmath7 grating blazed at 5500  ( 300b ) and the l600 filter , which is sensitive in the wavelength window of 4000 to 6000  , and ( ii ) 300 line mm@xmath7 grating blazed at 7500  ( 300r ) and the sy47 filter , which is sensitive in the wavelength window of 5000 to 9000  .",
    "the configuration for year 2006 was the same as the first year except the filter for the blue side .",
    "we replaced the l600 filter with a l550 filter which is more efficient for shorter wavelengths , widening the spectral window to 3600 to 9000  .",
    "table [ setups ] summarizes our configurations .",
    "because of the subaru s large aperture and a superb seeing site , we observed the subset of sdss targets with large host galaxy contamination .",
    "we aligned the slit so as to go through each sn candidate and host center .",
    "the slit angles were initially determined from the images taken by the sdss 2.5 m telescope , but then adjusted by checking the @xmath8-band images taken by the subaru telescope at the time of each observation .",
    "this slit alignment enabled us to simultaneously determine the sn type as well as its redshift .",
    "the redshift was generally determined using spectral lines of the host galaxy ( see  [ zz ] for details ) .",
    "the observations of the sn candidates were not typically made at the parallactic angle , and the observed spectra should be color corrected due to differential atmospheric refraction when the airmass was large .",
    "the atmospheric refraction was corrected by the adc .",
    "89 % of our targets were observed at an airmass smaller than 1.5 .",
    "we usually observed two spectrophotometric standard stars each night for the flux calibration ; at the beginning and the end of observations .",
    "table [ stdstar ] summarizes the list of standard stars observed in years 2005 and 2006 .",
    "all the sn candidates were observed for @xmath9 seconds for both the blue and red sides .",
    "candidates spectra were observed only once .",
    "the only exception was a peculiar variable sn10450 .",
    "we observed sn10450 with an exposure of 900 seconds and 1,800 seconds (  [ zz ] , @xcite ) .",
    "we determined types and redshifts of each target via real - time analysis .",
    "this information was collected by our spectroscopic coordinator and reported to the international astronomical union ( iau ) .",
    "type identification of three targets in our list was delayed due to high contamination by the host galaxy and lower s / n .",
    "detailed off - line analysis identified these three targets as sne ia .",
    "the spectroscopic data were reduced using the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) and our own programs written in c. the signals from objects were recorded in two - dimensional ( 2d ) ccd detectors ( called ,  frames \" hereafter ) .",
    "we carried out the reduction to obtain calibrated 2d spectra along the spatial and wavelength axes with iraf as follows .",
    "* bias subtraction : * even when the exposure time was zero , the pixel adu counts were not zero but some positive value ; a bias voltage was applied when reading the ccd to avoid negative values due to readout noise .",
    "this bias value ( adu counts when the exposure time was zero ) had to be subtracted from every frame .",
    "we used an overscan region of 2d bias spectra to subtract the bias .    * flat fielding : * we observed three dome flat fields for each grism and filter combination and created high s / n dome flats by taking the median of these three dome flat frames .",
    "we corrected for the non - uniformity by dividing the bias subtracted frame by the median dome flat field .",
    "* wavelength calibration : * we used night glow oh emission lines recorded in object spectra for the red side and the th - ar lamp emission lines taken separately from object frames for the blue side .",
    "the overall wavelength calibration was done using a legendre polynomial of third order for the red side and a legendre polynomial of fifth order for the blue side .",
    "the polynomial order was determined to minimize the rms of the wavelength residuals .",
    "* distortion correction : * our spectra are distorted in the spatial direction to some extent .",
    "we obtained a spatial distortion map for each frame by tracing the spatial location of spectrophotometric standard stars at each wavelength .",
    "we positioned the telescope so as to obtain spectra of objects and standard stars at the same position on the ccd .",
    "we then used the distortion map to correct for each object spectrum .",
    "* background subtraction : * background photons from night glow contaminated the frames .",
    "we subtracted this background contamination by masking the object region and fitting a low order polynomial function to the spatial profile along the wavelength axis .",
    "* flux calibration : * we observed spectrophotometric standard stars : bd+28@xmath64211 , feige110 , gd71 , bd+75@xmath6325 and feige34 .",
    "library spectra in iraf were used for bd+28@xmath64211 , feige110 , bd+75@xmath6325 and feige34 .",
    "a spectrum in the hst calibration database system ( calspec ) was used for gd71 to create the sensitivity function for the flux calibration , which is expressed as a fifth order cubic spline function .",
    "the best fit polynomial function was searched for each standard star spectrum .",
    "table [ stdspec ] is the list of spectrophotometric standard stars and the origin of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) used in this reduction .",
    "the extinction file for the mauna kea telescope was used to remove the telluric extinction .    *",
    "correction for dust extinction in our galaxy : * we corrected for dust extinction in our galaxy using @xmath10 and the color excess @xmath11 from @xcite .",
    "the extinction was assumed to follow the @xcite law .",
    "we developed c programs for the following processes :    * telluric absorption removal : * any spectra observed from the ground suffers from telluric absorption lines due to water and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere , especially at wavelengths longer than 5000  .",
    "the deepest is the a - band line at @xmath127600  . for targets at @xmath13 , most of our sample , this absorption is superimposed around the  siii  @xmath55972 \" or ",
    "siii  @xmath56355 \" feature . since flux calibration is not perfect for the removal of sharp lines , we derived telluric - line correction factors which varies with wavelength using the following process : ( i ) composite spectra for each season ( year 2005 and 2006 ) were created from all the frames of a spectrophotometric standard star obtained during our campaign of the year .",
    "bd+28@xmath64211 was used for this purpose , since this was the best observed standard star during the relevant seasons ( table [ stdstar ] ) .",
    "( ii ) a corresponding spectrum in the hst calspec database was chosen for comparison .",
    "library spectra of bd+28@xmath64211 are also available in the iraf package ; however , the size of the wavelength binning is smaller for the hst calspec spectrum ( 5  , black line in figure [ compbd ] ) , than the iraf spectrum ( larger than 50  , red pluses in figure [ compbd ] ) .",
    "moreover , the hst spectrum does not suffer from telluric absorption .",
    "note that up to a 10 % difference in flux between these two spectra ( bottom panel of figure [ compbd ] ) is observed .",
    "( iii ) the extent of absorption at each wavelength was examined by comparison of these spectra .",
    "figure [ telrm ] shows telluric - line correction factors for year 2005 ( red ) and 2006 ( green ) .",
    "calibration uncertainties are up to 4% near 6000  between these correction factors , perhaps due to different telescope pointing directions and atmospheric conditions at the observation times of the standard star and object observations .",
    "this could produce a comparable uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration . .",
    "we performed the telluric - line correction by dividing an observed spectrum by correction factors from the same year .",
    "it should be noted that residuals of telluric - lines could remain to some extent after this process because of variable atmospheric conditions .",
    "* seeing measurement : * seeing is the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the spatial profile recorded on the detector .",
    "we calculated the seeing using a 2d spectrum of a standard star , observed with a 2.0 \" slit ( wide enough to pass through all the photons from a point - like object ) , along the spatial and wavelength axes .",
    "the spatial profile of the star was traced in the wavelength direction with a gaussian function to obtain the seeing size as a function of wavelength .",
    "we used bd+28@xmath64211 , since this was the best observed standard star .",
    "figure [ seeing ] is an example of the seeing size in arcsec measured for bd+28@xmath64211 taken on the night of oct .",
    "27 , 2006 .",
    "the seeing is known to vary as an exponential with wavelength .",
    "we obtained the index of the seeing - wavelength relation for the subaru / focas instrument of @xmath14 : @xmath15 we used this relation for the sn extraction .",
    "the index for the focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph ( fors ) attached to the very large telescope ( vlt ) was reported to be -0.29 @xcite .",
    "the subaru / focas result is comparable to their value .",
    "* sn extraction : * the observed sne suffered from host galaxy contamination .",
    "the best way to eliminate the galaxy light from the sn candidate may be to observe the same galaxy with the same telescope configuration after the candidate disappears ; however , this takes considerable time . as an alternative",
    ", we have developed algorithms to eliminate the galaxy contribution .",
    "two proposed methods had been discussed in the literature : one was to extract sn spectra from 1d galaxy - contaminated spectra with the aid of galaxy template spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the other was to extract sn spectra from 2d galaxy - contaminated spectra without the aid of galaxy template spectra @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the latter method is that no assumption of a host galaxy spectrum is necessary . for this method",
    ", one should determine the spatial profiles for the sn and host components for the extraction .",
    "we developed an algorithm of sn extraction based on the latter concept .",
    "the basic concept is similar to the technique used by the supernova legacy survey collaboration @xcite , but developed independently .",
    "a model spectrum @xmath16 is assumed to be the sum of the sn and host galaxy flux : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the pixel index in the spatial direction and @xmath5 is the discretized wavelength .",
    "the function @xmath19 is the sn candidate flux density in the pixel ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 is the host galaxy flux density . the spatial profile of a point source @xmath19 is assumed to be a gaussian function : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the bestfit gaussian width for the sn candidate .",
    "the spatial profile of the extended component @xmath21 is assumed to be the sum of two gaussian functions .",
    "the summing was introduced in order to approximate the bulge and disk components of the host galaxy .",
    "we should note that a convolution with the psf of more sophisticated functions such as the de vaucouleurs @xmath24 law or an exponential law are more suited to fit galaxy morphologies .",
    "although a sum of two gaussians is just an approximation , the @xmath25 of fitting tells us that this approximation is reasonable for the majority of our sample . for our hosts with complicated spatial profiles",
    ", we performed a @xmath25 fitting by adjusting two gaussian peak positions representing the hosts",
    ". a larger number of gaussians or a more generalized function @xcite would be required for hosts with more complex spatial profiles .    in the fitting process",
    ", photon statistics was assumed to be the only source of the uncertainty @xmath26 .",
    "this uncertainty was assumed to be constant in the spatial direction @xmath27 and was estimated from the blank areas adjacent to the object .",
    "the width of the blank ( no sn nor hosts ) area was typically 25 arcsec on both sides , centered on the object .",
    "we minimized : @xmath28 where @xmath29 was the observed flux density at each pixel .",
    "the fitting was done with a two stage process .",
    "first , the model function @xmath16 was fitted to the averaged spatial profile created by averaging the 2d flux over the wavelength ranges ( 3600 to 5400 , 4000 to 6000 and 5000 to 9000  ) to determine the central positions and the widths of each component such as @xmath23 .",
    "the width @xmath23 should be identical to the seeing size .",
    "then , the spatial profile at each wavelength was fitted , with the spatial positions of the sn and its host fixed at the values obtained in the first step and the widths changing due to the seeing - wavelength relation of equation [ sw ] .    after finding the parameters ,",
    "a candidate spectrum @xmath30 , its uncertainty @xmath31 and the host galaxy spectrum @xmath32 were derived .",
    "if we created sn spectra by integrating flux over too wide a @xmath18 region , the s / n ratio became low .",
    "we restricted sn candidate flux within the fwhm ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35 , and the integral was calculated using the trapezoidal formula .    the sn flux uncertainty @xmath31 was estimated from : @xmath36 therefore",
    ", @xmath37 host galaxy spectra were constructed by subtracting the sn component @xmath38 from @xmath29 . in figure [ sec ]",
    ", we show an example of the sn extraction procedure .",
    "we should note that the fitting would be affected by the presence of emission lines .",
    "our method fits spatial profiles at each wavelength with the sum of two or three gaussian functions .",
    "when a host galaxy spatial profile can be approximated by a gaussian , the total spatial profile would be the sum of two gaussians .",
    "for the galaxy approximated by two gaussians , the total would be that of three gaussians .",
    "spatial profiles at the lines could be too complicated for our model if there were strong lines from host galaxies .",
    "since sne ia do not show emission lines in their spectra , we can regard emission lines in the extracted sn spectrum , more than 80 % of our sample , as those originated in their host galaxies .",
    "we can regard absorption lines in these spectra as galaxy origin if its width is smaller than expanding velocities of sn ejecta ( @xmath39 km  sec@xmath7 ) .",
    "a profile fit to a gaussian function might miss a few percent of the observed flux .",
    "an analysis of spatial profiles for standard stars showed a slight excess in flux at the outskirts of the spatial profile compared to the prediction of the gaussian function .",
    "we neglect this excess for our current analysis .    * combining spectra : * in most cases ,",
    "sn spectra were taken with two different combinations of grisms and filters : blue and red side spectra .",
    "we combined these two spectra by taking the average flux within the overlapping wavelength regions and scaling the red side to match the blue side flux and re - binning to 2  per pixel .",
    "the result is a contiguous science spectrum together with an uncertainty spectrum representing the statistical uncertainties in the flux in each binned pixel .",
    "* slitloss correction : * since seeing sizes were comparable to the slit width , some fraction of the object photons could not go through the slit .",
    "we corrected for this slitloss by estimating @xmath40 magnitudes at the spectroscopy date from light curves and spectra .",
    "magnitudes at the spectroscopy date were determined by interpolating the bestfit templates for the salt2 light curve fitter ( see the light curve fitting in  [ salt2fit ] ) .",
    "magnitudes were synthesized from spectra using @xmath40 filter responses .",
    "we matched the interpolated magnitudes with the synthetic magnitudes to determine a second - order polynomial slitloss correction function ; @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a coefficient .",
    "this function was determined for each spectrum .",
    " [ zz ] describes the method for determining types and redshifts for all the subaru targets and the following sections are dedicated only to sne ia .",
    "one can determine the redshift of the supernova either from the supernova itself or from the host galaxy ; the latter was our primary choice .",
    "the representative emission lines are balmer lines ( h@xmath43 and h@xmath44 ) and forbidden lines of [ nii ] , [ oii ] , [ oiii ] and [ sii ] .",
    "redshifts were determined from the wavelengths determined by fitting gaussian functions to all the emission lines .",
    "the absorption lines we used were ca h&k , mgb ( sn12991 ) and nad ( sn12979 ) .",
    "we identified absorption lines by visual inspection .",
    "the final redshift was the average value of all measured lines with equal weight .",
    "lines and their rest - wavelengths are listed in table [ emit ] . if there were no spectral lines in the host galaxy spectra , we adapted the technique of spectra template fitting to the sn spectrum .",
    "this technique cross - correlates sn spectra with a series of sn library spectra ( spectral templates and high quality nearby sn spectra ) and search for the @xmath25 minimum to determine redshifts and types ; details are explained in @xcite .",
    "the redshifts for 64 objects were determined from spectral lines of their host galaxies and seven were from the fitting of sn spectra .",
    "figure [ sbr_z ] shows the redshift distribution for all our targets except 1 agn at @xmath45 .",

    "we used the spectral surfaces of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) that we also used for the cosmological analysis of @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath65 is the normalized deviation from the typical spectrum @xmath62 and can be approximated with @xmath68 as @xmath69@xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath70 is the color law of a third order polynomial function monotonically increasing with wavelength and @xmath71 , the deviation from the mean sn ia ( b - v ) color , is its coefficient which is sensitive to both intrinsic color diversity and the host - dust reddening .",
    "we selected every photometric point of the @xmath40 band light curves unless a bad @xmath72 was assigned ; this happened when the photometric scaling factor was low , the rms magnitude of calibration stars was high , the variation in sky brightness was high , the frame fit quality for the sn photometry was poor , or no calibration stars were available in the frame ( corresponding to the @xmath73 as recommended in @xcite ) .",
    "we did not use @xmath74 and @xmath75 band data , since their s / n were not good enough for detailed analysis .",
    "the output parameters of this code were rest-@xmath76 band maximum magnitude @xmath77 , which is derived from @xmath63 , spectral deviation @xmath65 , color excess @xmath71 , and the date of maximum luminosity @xmath78 . in figure",
    "[ sbrdist ] , we present the distribution of sn phases at the spectroscopic epoch ( upper left ) , the redshift ( upper right ) , the spectral deviation @xmath65 ( lower left ) and the color excess @xmath71 ( lower right ) for the subaru sample . the sn phase is defined as the difference of dates between the spectral observation and maximum brightness divided by @xmath79 .",
    "we can see that the range of phases varies from -7 days to + 30 days and that the highest number is in the bin @xmath80 after maximum brightness ( top left panel ) .",
    "the redshift distribution reaches to the @xmath81 bin and it peaks at the @xmath82 bin ( top right ) .",
    "the lightcurve - width histogram resembles a right rectangle shape , with its oblique side decreasing with the value of @xmath65 .",
    "the number shortage of sne ia with large @xmath65 values is due to a bias that arose when the subaru targets were selected ( left bottom ) .",
    "most of the sample fall in the color range from -0.2 to 0.2 .",
    "the salt2 fitting gives large positive values of this parameter for ambiguous targets sn12844 , sn12979 and sn14475 , which are @xmath71 @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "these might be cool or dusty sne .",
    "we carried out followup spectroscopy of 71 sn ia candidates discovered by the sdss - ii supernova survey .",
    "nearly 90 % of the observed spectra were identified as sne ia , showing the high efficiency of the photometric selection .",
    "sn cosmology and related work , such as the study of spectroscopic diversity , will benefit from our observations .",
    "the number of sne ia in the intermediate redshift range has increased substantially .",
    "although observed spectra are a combination of the sn flux and the flux of their host galaxies , we succeeded in extracting the sn component from the observed spectra using code developed by the author .",
