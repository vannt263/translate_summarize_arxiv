    "the search for extrasolar planets around main sequence stars has already harvested thousands of candidates over the past decade ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although the number of confirmed exoplanets is now well over a thousand , no exomoons have yet been confirmed , though the smallest exoplanet detected has twice the mass of the moon @xcite . to date , no detections of extrasolar rocky objects with masses an order of magnitude lower than a lunar mass @xmath5 g have been reported .    in this letter , we propose a method to detect objects with masses several orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath3 in close orbits around white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "wds are ideal for two reasons .",
    "first , the small size of a wd compared to that of a main sequence star makes the detection of faint companion objects and their properties much easier @xcite .",
    "second , evidence for circumstellar rocky material already exists .",
    "the presence of metal enrichment on the surface of many wds suggests accretion of rocky debris , since the sedimentation timescale of wds is often orders of magnitude shorter than their age .",
    "the inferred metal accretion rates can not be accounted for by the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at least 30 wds show evidence for dusty disks that are within the roche zone of the host star @xcite .",
    "the  standard model \" ( see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) for these disks is that they originate from a close - in minor planet that was perturbed by an outer planet into the roche zone , where it disintegrated into a disk @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a small fraction of the disks might be accounted for by scrambled comets @xcite , though the metal abundance of most of the dusty disk wds favors tidal disruption of rocky objects .",
    "consistency with the dusty disk model places lower limits on the population of rocky objects around wds .",
    "@xcite developed a theoretical model where an underlying mass distribution of asteroids gradually accrete onto wds , and concluded that to explain photospheric absorption lines , asteroids of masses @xmath6 are required for typical wds .",
    "the minimum total mass required to explain the metal pollution alone in one dbz wd is @xmath7 @xcite , roughly the mass of ceres , the largest asteroid in the asteroid belt . with recent work estimating that @xmath8 wds with an age of 20200 myr accrete planetary debris @xcite , a method to directly detect such objects should either lead to many detections or a revision of the current paradigm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we study the properties of objects with masses much less than @xmath3 arounds wds . in  3 , we calculate the minimum size of objects that could be detected with existing telescopes and the future james webb space telescope ( jwst ) .",
    "finally , we discuss possible issues as well as the significance of detection ( or upper limits ) in  4 , and summarize our conclusions in  5 .",
    "the tidal locking timescale for a gravitationally bound rocky object with @xmath10 at an orbital radii @xmath11 au around a wd is @xmath12 yr @xcite ,    i.e. , much shorter than the planet formation timescale of @xmath13  10 myr for the objects under consideration .",
    "we thus expect that virtually all asteroids should be tidally locked to the host wd .    over the age of the solar system , only objects with a mass @xmath14 can retain volatiles at 50 k @xcite . at higher temperatures ,",
    "a much larger mass is needed , since the timescale for the atmosphere to leak away is dominated by an exponential in inverse temperature , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the atomic weight and @xmath17 is the radius of the object which has units of pressure : @xmath18 . with @xmath19 , we obtain a critical mass for sphericity @xmath20 . for a rocky body with a composition similar to that of the moon , @xmath21 kpa and @xmath22 .",
    "thus we expect objects with @xmath23 to be spherical . a more detailed analysis @xcite refines @xmath24 by less than an order of magnitude . ] . therefore , the objects under consideration here are unlikely to have atmospheres .    in the absence of an atmosphere ,",
    "the temperature differences between the night and day sides of an object must be of order unity , because thermal conduction is inefficient .",
    "the situation is more dramatic than in the case of our moon , because one side of the object will be tidally locked with the wd illumination .",
    "the power transmitted by thermal conduction is    @xmath25    whereas the power radiated due to blackbody radiation is of order @xmath26 for an object at 600 k with mass @xmath4 and a thermal conductivity @xmath27 , radiation is 7 orders of magnitude more efficient than conduction .",
    "another way to decrease the contrast between the day and night side is by tidal heating of the objects .",
    "the power @xmath28 generated by the oscillating tidal forces as the object cycles from apoapsis to periapsis is @xcite    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the minor planet s tidal dissipation function @xcite . for @xmath31 and a semi - major axis @xmath32 au ,",
    "@xmath28 is 15 orders of magnitude less than @xmath33 .",
    "the upper bound on the temperature of the object is obtained at the roche radius @xmath34 , giving @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are the temperature , radius , and mass of the wd .",
    "dust and small rocky objects are expected to disintegrate at the rock sublimation temperature of @xmath39  1500 k @xcite . motivated by dusty debris observations , we target asteroids which do not contain a significant amount of ice , since these will sublimate at even lower temperatures .",
    "that magellan fire or jwst miri could detect for both sirius b and g29 - 38 with a @xmath13 hr exposure as a function of the minor planet temperature @xmath40 . on the upper axis , we plot the normalized orbital period @xmath41 of the asteroid . for sirius b , @xmath42 and for g29 - 38 ,",
    "ground based telescopes like magellan are only sensitive out to a wavelength of @xmath44 , and thus quickly lose sensitivity to cooler asteroids .",
    "limited photometric stability of jwst may increase @xmath45 . ]    next , we show that it is feasible to observe objects with a mass as low as @xmath4 with jwst . the temperature @xmath40 of a minor planet with exposed area @xmath46 separated by a distance @xmath47 from a wd with temperature @xmath36 is given by balancing the heating from the wd illumination with cooling from blackbody radiation : @xmath48 , where we neglect the albedo @xmath49 for a rocky object .",
    "this yields @xmath50 . at the roche zone",
    "orbital separation of @xmath51 au , @xmath40 could reach @xmath52 . for a fixed orbital distance",
    ", the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath53 depends on the flux of the wd as follows :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the distance from earth to the wd .",
    "the distribution of wd temperatures can be written as @xmath56 .",
    "assuming self - similarity in the temperature profile as the wd cools , @xmath57 .",
    "for a constant production rate of wds , @xmath58 , this yields @xmath59 , which is in reasonable agreement with observed wd statistics @xcite .",
    "since the number of wds out to a distance @xmath55 scales as @xmath60 , this implies that the minimum distance needed to observe a white dwarf with temperature @xmath61 scales like @xmath62 , or    @xmath63    therefore it is typically advantageous to target hot wds , even though they are rarer and therefore farther away .",
    "note that equation ( [ snt ] ) applies to asteroids whose temperatures are roche limited . in the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectrum , the flux from the asteroid will oscillate with an amplitude @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the inclination of the orbital plane relative to the line - of - sight .",
    "unless @xmath66 , we will see oscillations with a period equal to the orbital period of the object , as the body alternates between exposing its day to night sides .",
    "roughly 100 times more wds are feasible for this technique compared to transiting systems .",
    "therefore , we can target wds which are closer by a factor @xmath67 than in transit surveys , with a flux higher by @xmath68 , improving the resulting @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the most abundant wds are a few gyr old and have temperatures in the @xmath69 k range",
    ". however , emission from asteroids would be difficult to observe from the ground for cold wds , since the sky is bright at ir wavelengths @xmath70 , whereas the peak emission from a rocky asteroid is at @xmath71 . for instruments sensitive to @xmath72 , only a few systems are hot enough and close enough to be observed from the ground .",
    "the brightest wd in the sky is sirius b , with v magnitude 8.3 and an effective temperature of @xmath73 k. the estimated age of sirius b , @xmath74 myr @xcite , is sufficient to allow for planetesimal formation , a process which occurred in our solar system on a @xmath13  10 myr time scale ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although sirius b orbits the main sequence star sirius a , they are separated by 3  11.5 arcsec ( 8.2  31.5 au ) , making it possible to resolve sirius b alone . with a @xmath75 duty cycle over @xmath76 hrs ( for a few hours of total integration time ) , it will be possible to detect the variable emission from an object with a mass @xmath77 with the folded - port infrared echellette ( fire ) on one of the twin 6.5 meter magellan telescopes .",
    "of these objects requires a photometric stability of @xmath78 ppm on a few hours timescale .",
    "rms fluctuations of @xmath79 ppm have already been achieved on one minute timescales ( see figure 6 of @xcite ) ; fluctuations on 2 hour long timescales should be @xmath80 assuming white temporal noise , giving us the desired sensitivity .",
    "however , atmospheric effects such as a time - dependent airmass could lead to systematic errors on hour - long time scales , though calibration against nearby stars may alleviate such issues .",
    "although we simulate observations with fire , an imager such as the mmt and magellan infrared spectrograph detection ( mmirs ) would achieve virtually identical limits and allow for real - time photometric calibration against other stars .",
    "alternatively , the odds of finding an object may be increased around dusty , metal - rich wds .",
    "the most well studied dusty wd is g29 - 38 ( see e.g. @xcite ) which has a temperature @xmath81 k and is 14 pc away .",
    "g29 - 38 s roche zone coincides with its sublimation zone , implying that periodic flux variations can occur over exceedingly short timescales @xmath82 hr . in figure 1",
    ", we show the minimum mass @xmath45 that a @xmath13 hr observation with fire on one of the magellan telescopes could detect on both sirius b and g29 - 38 .",
    "as the temperature of the objects drops , the minimum mass increases dramatically since fire is only sensitive out to a wavelength of @xmath44 . for g29 - 38 ,",
    "the required photometric stability is only @xmath79 ppm , as the white dwarf is cooler than sirius b and poisson - limited size of the objects is much larger .    in calculating detectability thresholds",
    ", we assumed that the signal to noise for detecting an asteroid is limited by the poisson noise of photon counts from the host wd :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the number of photons per unit wavelength per unit emitted surface area received by the telescope from a blackbody at temperature @xmath61 over an integration time @xmath85 . @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the effective surface areas of the planet and white dwarfs , respectively .",
    "the normalization of @xmath88 is fixed by the brightness of a wd .",
    "requiring @xmath89 , we solve for the minimum size of a asteroid that can be detected as a function of wd parameters .",
    "for real observations , the required exposure time may be greater by a factor of order unity depending on the spacing of the observations in the time domain .",
    "once evidence is found for a asteroid , follow up observations with a similar integration time but with a cadence optimized for the period of the asteroid would give the best statistics .",
    "submillimeter observations with ground - based experiments like the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) could constrain the population of cooler asteroids , though the signals would be periodic on a longer timescale as the orbital period scales @xmath90 .",
    "hotter asteroids could also be targeted , but alma would then probe the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectrum where it is not possible to constrain the temperature of the asteroid and therefore difficult to distinguish it from atmospheric features on the surface of a wd ( see  4 ) .      a space - based mid - infrared telescope will dramatically improve our constraints on rocky bodies , allowing detection of asteroids around older , cooler wds . in particular , the mid infrared instrument ( miri )",
    "onboard jwst is sensitive in the 5  28.3 @xmath91 spectral range , which will dramatically decrease the minimum observable mass , especially at lower temperatures where the peak emission is at @xmath92 .    in figure 1 , we show the minimum mass that a @xmath13 hr observation with jwst could detect on both sirius b and g29 - 38 .",
    "note that the logarithmic slope is much shallower for jwst than magellan . at @xmath93",
    "k , jwst will improve constraints on asteroid masses by three orders of magnitude if a photometric stability of @xmath94 ppm per one - minute exposure is achieved . for cooler , more distant white dwarfs ,",
    "the required photometric stability is less stringent .",
    "a potential source of error in future observations might be distinguishing asteroids from atmospheric features on the wd such as spots , although there is currently no evidence @xcite .",
    "one simple way to break the degeneracy is to constrain the effective temperature of the object . in particular",
    ", the period of the flux oscillation allows one to predict ( up to a factor of order unity due to uncertainty in albedo ) the temperature of the asteroid . for a fixed integration time , the fractional uncertainty in the temperature of the minor planet is @xmath95 in the limit where the spectroscopic band is much wider than the wavelength spread in the emitted spectrum of the asteroid .",
    "unless experimental constraints force us to observe only in the rayleigh - jeans regime of the spectrum , only a factor of order unity more integration time will be necessary to constrain the asteroid s temperature to a value much cooler than any plausible spot on the wd surface .",
    "if multiple asteroids are orbiting close in , fourier analysis in the time domain should distinguish the various objects , as asteroids on different orbits will have different periods .",
    "note that the discovery of objects at multiple periods would require be increasingly harder to explain with spots , as a naive model would have all spots rotate with the same period .",
    "furthermore , detection of multiple blackbody components with effective temperatures given by the inferred orbital radii would be a way to confirm the multiple asteroid interpretation .",
    "on the other hand , if there are multiple asteroids with very similar periods but different orbital phases , @xmath53 will be reduced as the differing phases wash out the amplitude of the periodic signal . in the limit of a thin dusty disk ,",
    "the observable periodicity is lost .",
    "consequently , our observational strategy is optimal if asteroids do not spend too long near the roche zone ( such that many asteroids could be in similar orbits ) nor too little time near the roche zone ( such that few asteroids will ever be detected ) .",
    "the detection of asteroids around wds would be a powerful probe of planetary physics .",
    "a survey of nearby wds by jwst could constrain the distribution function @xmath96 , where @xmath40 and @xmath97 are the temperature and mass of asteroids , respectively .",
    "@xmath98 can then be used to infer the statistical evolution of asteroids with time , since @xmath36 is linked to the age of the wd by the wd cooling function .",
    "for example , the tidal disruption model implies that @xmath99 must be intimately tied to the abundance of dusty disks @xmath100 .",
    "a generic prediction of this model is that any changes in the mass of debris disks should be accompanied by metal accretion onto the surface of the wd and/or a non - trivial @xmath101 dependence .",
    "since constraints have already been placed on @xmath102 , observations of @xmath99 could falsify or refine this model .",
    "in addition to detecting minor planets , this technique could also harvest exoplanet detections , though we would expect @xmath103 for planets with atmospheres . to distinguish a large planet with a small @xmath104 from a small object with a larger @xmath104",
    ", the blackbody spectrum of the object could be obtained and used to infer the effective surface area .",
    "furthermore , the mass of close - in exoplanets could in principle be constrained by observations , as tidal forces should pull the planet into an ellipsoid .",
    "as a planet orbits the wd , the effective area of the planet will change over a period @xmath105 , as opposed to flux oscillations with a period @xmath61 from the planet s day / night temperature gradient . +",
    "we have shown that the periodic flux variability from the night / day oscillations of close - in asteroids allows existing and future telescopes to detect objects with a small fraction of the moon s mass .",
    "a possible strategy would be to use an existing - ground based telescope to search for asteroids around nearby wds with @xmath106 12,000 k. jwst can then be used to follow up ground - based observations in order to improve the associated constraints by a few orders of magnitude on already - observed targets and to sample the asteroid environments around the entire population of local wds .",
    "the unique environment of wds thus affords an unprecedented window into the physics of planet formation ."
