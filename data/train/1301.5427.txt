    "a counterintuitive feature of relativistic particles is the unimpeded penetration through high and wide potential barriers , termed klein tunneling.@xcite rooted in negative energy states in the barrier , klein tunneling is caused in graphene by a particularity of the band structure.@xcite the intersection of energy bands at the edge of the brillouin zone leads to a gapless conical energy spectrum in two inequivalent valleys .",
    "low - energy quasiparticles are described by a massless dirac equation@xcite and have a pseudospin which gives the contribution of the two sublattices of the graphene honeycomb lattice to their make - up .",
    "the projection of the pseudospin on the direction of motion  is responsible for the conservation of pseudospin and the absence of backscattering for potentials diagonal in sublattice space.@xcite this allows an experimental verification of klein tunneling in a solid state system .",
    "early resistance measurements across a barrier indicated klein tunneling@xcite and in a conclusive experiment klein tunneling was revealed in the phase shift of the conductance fringes at low magnetic field.@xcite    due to klein tunneling electrons can usually not be confined electrostatically .",
    "thus , designs for circuitry taken from traditional semiconductor - based electronics can not be used in graphene and unconventional electronic devices are designed on optical analogs.@xcite this has lead to the proposal of a potential step as a lens for propagating electron beams @xcite or the experimental implementation of the counterpart of an optical fiber cable.@xcite    in the present work we study , guided by the analogy to mie scattering of light on small particles,@xcite the scattering of a plane electron wave on a circular potential step in graphene . the set - up we consider is a plane graphene sheet on a gated substrate with a separate circular region to tune the potential step by applying a bias .",
    "circular dots have mostly been analyzed in etched structures with a focus on electron confinement as potential hosts for spin qbits.@xcite moreover , single dots and voids@xcite as well as multiple dots arranged in a corral@xcite have been used to model the scattering by impurities or metallic islands placed on a graphene sheet .",
    "the configuration we consider has been studied for bound states in unbiased graphene@xcite and for its ray optical scattering properties in single and bilayer graphene.@xcite we show that the dot operates as an electron switch with the preferred scattering angles controlled by its size and applied bias . for small dots forward scattering and klein tunneling can be almost completely suppressed due to a fano resonance@xcite between the background partition and the resonant contribution to electron scattering .",
    "for a gate potential that is smooth on the scale of the lattice constant but sharp on the scale of the de broglie wavelength the low - energy electron dynamics is described by the single - valley dirac - hamiltonian @xmath0 where r is the radius , @xmath1 the applied bias of the gated region , and @xmath2 are pauli matrices .",
    "we use units such that @xmath3 and the fermi velocity @xmath4 . we do not consider effects of disorder or edge roughness of the step , which are beyond the present continuum approach . our focus is on the analogy to optics .",
    "the difference between dirac s equation , governing a two - spinor wavefunction in 2d , and maxwell s equations in 3d limits this analogy .",
    "in particular klein tunneling , which is also found for a smooth gate potential @xcite or from a tight - binding calculation,@xcite has no optical equivalent .",
    "known phenomena from mie scattering will appear in graphene in new guise to satisfy the absence of backscattering . to solve the scattering problem ,",
    "we expand the incident plane wave in eigenfunctions in polar coordinates , @xmath5 and match the reflected wave @xmath6 and the transmitted wave @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the wave vector inside the gated region ) term by term so that continuity of the wavefunction is satisfied .",

    "the similar form of the scattering coefficients @xmath28 in optical mie scattering@xcite and in graphene should allow for the same scattering phenomena .",
    "indeed , the scattering efficiency as a function of @xmath29 and @xmath30 shows the same trends : @xmath31 features sharp resonances due to the excitation of normal modes for large @xmath30 and small @xmath29 and a broad and overlapping ripple structure for larger @xmath29 ( cf .",

    "a small @xmath32 leads to a large @xmath30 while @xmath33 entails @xmath34 .",

    "this is surprising as the incident electron impacts non - normally on parts of the circular gated region which should give rise to reflection .",

    "the electron density increases dramatically inside the dot ( fig .",

    "the current field inside the dot is @xmath59 an analysis of this expression ( see fig .  [ figure3 ] for the @xmath36 mode ) reveals a vortex pattern symmetric to the @xmath60-axis which dominates the near - field ( fig .",

    "the incident wave is fed into vortices , which trap the electron .",
    "note that the particle is confined in vortices , not by total internal reflection.@xcite the vortex pattern of the mode @xmath28 is dominated by @xmath61 vortices close to the boundary of the circle which are reflected by @xmath62 preferred scattering directions in the far field .",
    "the radial reflected current @xmath63 shows that for the @xmath36 mode only forward scattering is favoured ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]f ) , while for higher modes more preferred scattering directions emerge ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]i for @xmath37 ) .    for small electron energies",
    "the @xmath36 mode is relatively broad compared to the sharp resonances of higher modes .",
    "constructive and destructive interference between a resonant @xmath28 mode and the off - resonant @xmath36 mode can give rise to fano resonances similar to the effect of the hybridization between a continuum and a discrete level in electronic transitions.@xcite in optics they are routinely used to tailor properties of plasmonic structures@xcite and have recently been identified for mie scattering by a sphere,@xcite where they allow to switch from forward to backward scattering .",
    "the scattering efficiency reveals no fano signatures but the angle dependent scattering which depends also on the phases of the scattering coefficients encompasses interference effects .",
    "remarkably we find that over a fano resonance a small variation of parameters can lead to dramatic changes in the near field , such as an inversion of the vortex pattern which causes in the far field a change in the preferred scattering direction and even leads to a suppression of klein tunneling and electron depletion behind the quantum dot .",
    "figure  [ figure4 ] gives the example of the @xmath37 resonance ( preferred scattering angles @xmath64 ) , over an off - resonant @xmath36 background ( preferred scattering angle @xmath65 ) .",
    "for @xmath65 the contributions of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 mode can have the same amplitude and interference causes an asymmetric lineshape of @xmath48 across the resonance with enhancement above and suppression below .",
    "this can be understood from the vortex structure in the near field . above the resonance destructive interference",
    "suppresses counterrevolving vortices and electrons stream through the center of the gated region . below the resonance",
    "the couterrevolving vortices are enhanced and suppress forward scattering ( fig .",
    "[ figure4]a , b ) .",
    "only side scattering remains in the far field ( fig .",
    "[ figure4]c ) and , most notably , in the near field the current field shows a depletion of klein tunneling at the dot ( fig .",

    "to sum up , we demonstrated that a circular gated region in graphene may act as a lens focusing a dirac electron beam . scattering resonances enable particle confinement and",
    "interference effects may switch forward scattering on and off .",
