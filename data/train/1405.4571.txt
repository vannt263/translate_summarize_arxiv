    "cooperative multiple - input and multiple - output ( mimo ) systems can obtain diversity gains by providing copies of the transmitted signals with the help of relays to improve the reliability of wireless communication systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind these cooperative relaying systems is to employ multiple relay nodes between the source node and the destination node to form a distributed antenna array , which can provide significant advantages in terms of diversity gains .",
    "several cooperation strategies that exploit the links between the relay nodes and the destination node such as amplify - and - forward ( af ) , decode - and - forward ( df ) , compress - and - forward ( cf ) @xcite and distributed space - time coding ( dstc ) schemes @xcite , @xcite that employ space - time codes @xcite have been extensively studied in the literature . a key problem that arises in the cooperative mimo systems and which degrades the performance such systems is the existence of delays between the signals that are space - time coded at the relays and decoded at the destination .",
    "delay - tolerant space - time coding ( dt - stc ) schemes @xcite-@xcite which address the delay between the relay nodes have been recently considered for distributed mimo systems . extending the distributed threaded algebraic space - time ( tast ) codes @xcite , damen and hammons designed a delay - tolerant coding scheme in @xcite by the extension of the galois group and field employed in the coding scheme to achieve full diversity and full rate .",
    "a further optimization which ensures that the codes in @xcite have full diversity with the minimum length and lower decoding complexity is presented in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite propose delay - tolerant distributed linear convolutional stcs which can maintain the full diversity property under any delay profile . in @xcite , a precoder based on the linear constellation precoder ( lcp ) design is employed to construct an optimal dt - stc to achieve the upper bound of the error probability .    in the literature",
    "so far , two basic configurations of distributed space - time schemes have been reported : one in which the coding is performed independently at the relays @xcite and another in which coding is performed across the relays @xcite .",
    "it is not clear the key advantages of these schemes and their suitability for situations with delays .",
    "in addition , the work on delay - tolerant space - time codes has focused on schemes that do not employ feedback to improve the performance of the systems .",
    "strategies to exploit feedback and improve the design of distributed space - time coding schemes remain unexplored .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an adaptive delay - tolerant distributed space - time coding scheme that employs feedback and devise a design algorithm for cooperative mimo relaying systems with delays at the relay nodes .",
    "a delay - tolerant adjustable code matrices optimization ( dt - acmo ) algorithm based on the the ml criterion subject to constraints on the transmitted power at the relays for different cooperative systems is presented .",
    "adaptive optimization algorithms using least - squares ( ls ) estimation method are developed for the dt - acmo scheme in order to release the destination node from the high computational complexity of the optimization process .",
    "in particular , we consider network configurations in which the coding is performed across the relays and independently at the relays to study existing and the proposed delay - tolerant distributed space - time coding scheme .",
    "we study how the adjustable code matrix affects the dstbc during the encoding process and how to optimize the adjustable code matrices by employing an ml detector .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the simulation results lead to the conclusion that with the same number of antennas at the source node and the destination node in sas and mas , if the number of the relay nodes with single antenna is the same as the number of multi - antenna relay nodes , the same diversity order and ber performance can be achieved when the synchronization is perfect at the relay node .",

    "it is worth to mention that the delay profiles in the simulations are different . in the proposed algorithm",
    "the df strategy is employed which requires re - encoding at the relay nodes , and the full alamouti scheme is obtained at each of the @xmath101 relay nodes .",
    "the results illustrate that without the dl , by making use of the randomized encoding technique in @xcite , a @xmath103db ber performance improvement can be achieved compared to the d - alamouti scheme with and without the delay .",
    "it is also worth to mention that the dt - acmo algorithm can be employed in the mas to achieve a better ber performance as both of algorithms employ dstcs and can perform the optimization at the destination node . with the consideration of the delay profiles ,",
    "the results indicate that the diversity order will not reduced , and using the dt - acmo rls algorithm an improved performance is achieved with @xmath105db of gain as compared to employing the rstc algorithm in @xcite and @xmath106db of gain as compared to employing the traditional dstbc algorithm .",
    "the simulation results illustrate that for mas with different dstc schemes when the same delay profiles are considered , a @xmath35db performance improvement is obtained .",
    "it is because when the full dstc schemes can be obtained at the relay nodes employed in mas , at the destination node a delayed symbol matrix with increased dimension is received which means the observation window is bigger than that with the non - delayed mas .    #",
