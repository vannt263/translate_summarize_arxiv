    "probability distributions that take correlations into account , can be in some cases constructed by deformation of mathematical independent laws @xcite . along this line of approach , a variety of generalizations of the binomial distribution have been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "the generalization consists in replacing the sequence of natural numbers that correspond to the variable of the original binomial distribution , by an arbitrary sequence of non - negative numbers .",
    "consequently , their factorial and combinatorial numbers are redefined , in such a way that the simple powers of `` win '' ( `` loose '' ) probability must be replaced by characteristic polynomials whose degree is the number of wins ( loose ) .",
    "these polynomials are obtained through generating functions that force the generalized distributions to still satisfy the conditions of normalization and non - negativeness .",
    "resulting probabilities @xmath25 can be symmetrical or asymmetrical , and represent the probability of having @xmath6 wins and @xmath26 losses , in a sequence of @xmath7 _ correlated _ trials .",
    "we shall be concerned with a particular set of _ symmetrically _ generalized binomial distributions , so as to preserve the win - loss symmetry , which is an essential prerequisite for the distribution to be used in the present analysis of strongly correlated systems and their entropic behavior .",
    "the generating functions of this particular set are @xmath27-exponentials ( @xmath4^{1/(1-q^{gen})};\\,e_{1}^z = e^z)$ ] , where _ gen _ stands for _ generating _ , and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath2 being a parameter to be soon defined .",
    "these generating functions are the only ones , besides the ordinary binomial case ( which corresponds @xmath30 ) , that yield probabilities which obey the leibnitz triangle rule ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the family of the generated probabilities depends on two parameters ( @xmath31 , @xmath2 ) , where @xmath31 is the `` win '' probability , @xmath32 is the  loss \" probability , and @xmath2 characterizes the generating function .",
    "a variety of @xmath3-statistical functions @xcite related to the probabilities @xmath0 emerges , all of them univocally defined by @xmath24 , and whose respective @xmath33 indices appear to obey an algebra that reminds the underlying algebra in @xcite .",
    "in fact , such probabilities provide a probability distribution function of the scaled quantity @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) that is likely to achieve any of the complete set @xcite of bounded support @xmath8-gaussian @xmath36 ( where _ disc _ stands for _ discrete _ , and @xmath37 ) , where @xmath38 is a generalized inverse temperature ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the @xmath3-gaussian form corresponds to strongly correlated random variables , and arises from the extremization of the nonadditive entropy @xmath40 ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , where bg stands for boltzmann - gibbs ) @xcite under appropriate constraints @xcite .    since the proposal in @xcite , several statistical models which provide , in the @xmath22 limit",
    ", @xmath3-gaussian attractors have been constructed @xcite .",
    "some of them exhibit extensivity of the boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath43 , and at least one of them exhibits extensivity of the @xmath44 entropy for @xmath45 @xcite . in particular , the @xmath27-exponentially generated probabilities @xmath0 exhibit an extensive @xmath43 @xcite , and they appear to provide @xmath11-gaussian attractors ( where @xmath46 stands for _ attractor _ ) . an outstanding fact is that these probabilities have been rigorously deduced a priori , imposing a particular structure of the generating function ( see also @xcite ) under non - negativeness and normalization probability conditions .",
    "in addition to these properties , these probabilities can be shown to correspond to the plya urn model @xcite .",

    "@xcite , based on the @xmath27-exponential generating functions .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the characterization of the involved @xmath3-gaussian distributions ( where @xmath3 refers to @xmath8 for finite @xmath7 , and to @xmath11 in the @xmath22 limit ) in the generalized probability distribution of the ratio ( number of wins)/(number of realizations ) .",
    "section [ sec4 ] describes large - deviation - like properties of the distribution of the scaled quantity @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "section [ sec5 ] deals with the behavior of the large - deviation probabilities with regard to the @xmath10 limit distribution , which violates the law of large numbers .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in a sequence of @xmath49 independent trials with two possible outcomes , `` win '' and `` loss '' , the probability of obtaining @xmath6 wins is given by the binomial distribution : @xmath50 where the parameter @xmath31 ( @xmath51 ) is the probability of having the outcome `` win '' , @xmath32 corresponding to the outcome `` loss '' .",
    "therefore , the bernoulli binomial distribution above preserves the symmetry win - loss .",
