    "relative entropy with respect to @xmath2 is defined as @xmath3 and the shannon entropy of @xmath4 is defined as @xmath5 the usual convention is @xmath6 if @xmath7 and @xmath8 if @xmath9 . ] or kullback - leibler divergence @xmath10 between two probability measures is a fundamental quantity that arises in a variety of situations in probability theory , statistics , and information theory . in probability theory , it arises as the rate function for estimating the probability of a large deviation for the empirical measure of independent samplings . in statistics , for example , it arises as the best error exponent in deciding between two hypothetical distributions for observed data . in shannon theory , it is the penalty in expected compressed length , namely the gap from shannon entropy @xmath11 , when the compressor assumes ( for a finite - alphabet source ) a mismatched probability measure @xmath2 instead of the true probability measure @xmath4 .",
    "relative entropy also brings statistics and probability theory together to provide a foundation for the well - known maximum entropy principle for decision making under uncertainty .",
    "this is an idea that goes back to l.  boltzmann , was popularized by e.  t.  jaynes @xcite , and has its foundation in the theory of large deviation .",
    "suppose that an ensemble average measurement ( say sample mean , sample second moment , or any other similar linear statistic ) is made on the realization of a sequence of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables .",
    "the realization must then have an empirical measure that obeys the constraint placed by the measurement  the empirical measure must belong to an appropriate convex set , say @xmath12 .",
    "large deviation theory tells us that a special member of @xmath12 , denoted @xmath13 , is overwhelmingly more likely than the others .",
    "if the alphabet @xmath14 is finite ( with cardinality @xmath15 ) , and the prior probability ( before measurement ) is the uniform measure @xmath16 on @xmath14 , then @xmath13 is the one that minimizes the relative entropy @xmath17 which is the same as the one that maximizes ( shannon ) entropy , subject to @xmath18 .",
    "this explains why the principle is called maximum entropy principle . in jaynes words , _",
    "`` ... it is maximally noncommittal to the missing information '' _ @xcite .    as a physical example ,",
    "let us tag a particular molecule in the atmosphere .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the height of the molecule in the atmosphere .",
    "then the potential energy of the molecule is @xmath20 .",
    "let us suppose that the average potential energy is held constant , that is , @xmath21",
    "= c$ ] , a constant .",
    "then the probability distribution of the height of the molecule is taken to be the exponential distribution @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "this is also the maximum entropy probability distribution subject to first moment constraint @xcite .    more generally , if the prior probability ( before measurement ) is @xmath2 , then @xmath13 minimizes @xmath24 subject to @xmath18 .",
    "something more specific can be said : @xmath13 is the limiting conditional distribution of a `` tagged '' particle under the conditioning imposed by the measurement .",
    "this is called _ the conditional limit theorem _ or the _ gibbs conditioning principle _ ; see for example campenhout and cover @xcite or csiszr @xcite for a more general result .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath10 behaves like `` squared euclidean distance '' and has the `` pythagorean property '' ( csiszr @xcite ) . in view of this and",
    "since @xmath13 minimizes @xmath24 subject to @xmath18 , one says that @xmath13 is `` closest '' to @xmath2 in the relative entropy sense amongst the measures in @xmath12 , or in other words , `` @xmath13 is the forward @xmath25-projection of @xmath2 on @xmath12 '' .",
    "motivated by the above maximum entropy and gibbs conditioning principles , @xmath25-projection was extensively studied by csiszr @xcite , @xcite , csiszr and mat @xcite , csiszr and shields @xcite , and csiszr and tusndy @xcite .",
    "more recently , minimizations of general entropy functionals with convex integrands were studied by csiszr and mat @xcite .",
    "these include bregman s divergences and csiszr s @xmath26-divergences .",
    "@xmath25-minimization also arises in the contraction principle in large deviation theory ( see for example dembo and zeitouni s @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is on projections or minimization problems associated with a parametric generalization of relative entropy . to see how this parametric generalization arises",
    ", we return to our remark on how relative entropy arises in shannon theory . for this",
    ", we must first recall how rnyi entropies are a parametric generalization of the shannon entropy .",
    "rnyi entropies @xmath27 for @xmath28 play the role of shannon entropy when the _ normalized cumulant _ of compression length is considered instead of expected compression length .",
    "campbell @xcite showed that @xmath29 \\to h_{\\alpha } ( p ) ~ ( \\mbox{as } n \\to \\infty)\\ ] ] for an i.i.d .",
    "source with marginal @xmath4 .",
    "the minimum is over all compression strategies @xmath30 that satisfy the kraft inequality assigns a target codeword length @xmath31 to each string @xmath32 . ] , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the cumulant parameter .",
    "we also have @xmath35 , so that rnyi entropy may be viewed as a generalization of shannon entropy .    if the compressor assumed that the true probability measure is @xmath2 , instead of @xmath4 , then the gap in the normalized cumulant s optimal value is an analogous parametric divergence quantity , which we shall denote @xmath36 @xcite . the same quantity . ]",
    "also arises when we study the gap from optimality of mismatched guessing exponents .",
    "see arikan @xcite and hanawal and sundaresan @xcite for general results on guessing , and see sundaresan @xcite,@xcite on how @xmath36 arises in the context of mismatched guessing .",
    "recently , bunte and lapidoth @xcite have shown that the @xmath36 also arises as redundancy in a mismatched version of the problem of coding for tasks .",
    "as one might expect , it is known that ( see for example , sundaresan ( * ? ? ?",
    "v-5 ) ) or johnson and vignat ( * ? ? ?",
    "* a.1 ) ) @xmath37 , so that we may think of relative entropy as @xmath38 .",
    "thus @xmath1 is a generalization of relative entropy , i.e. , a _ _ relative @xmath0-entropy__.    not surprisingly , the maximum rnyi entropy principle has been considered as a natural alternative to the maximum entropy principle of decision making under uncertainty .",
    "this principle is equivalent to another principle of maximizing the so - called tsallis entropy which happens to be a monotone function of the rnyi entropy .",
    "rnyi entropy maximizers under moment constraints are distributions with a power - law decay ( when @xmath39 ) .",
    "see costa et al .",
    "@xcite or johnson and vignat @xcite .",
    "many statistical physicists have studied this principle in the hope that it may `` explain '' the emergence of power - laws in many naturally occurring physical and socio - economic systems , beginning with tsallis @xcite . based on our explorations of the vast literature on this topic",
    ", we feel that our understanding , particularly one that ought to involve a modeling of the _ dynamics _ of such systems with the observed power - law profiles as equilibria in the asymptotics of large time , is not yet as mature as our understanding of the classical boltzmann - gibbs setting .",
    "but , by noting that @xmath40 , we see that both the maximum rnyi entropy principle and the maximum tsallis entropy principle are particular instances of a `` minimum relative @xmath0-entropy principle '' : @xmath41 we shall call the minimizing @xmath13 as the forward @xmath1-projection of @xmath2 on @xmath12 .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to study forward @xmath1-projections in general measure spaces .",
    "our main contributions are on existence , uniqueness , and structure of these projections .",
    "we have several motivations to publish our work .",
    "* we provide a rather general sufficient condition on the constraint set under which a forward @xmath1-projection exists and is unique .",
    "this can enable statistical physicists to speak of the rnyi entropy maximizer and explore its properties even if the maximizer is not known explicitly . while the existence and uniqueness of @xmath1-projection for closed convex sets @xmath12 was shown for the finite alphabet case by sundaresan @xcite , here we study more general measure spaces ( for example @xmath42 ) .",
    "* unlike relative entropy , its generalization relative @xmath0-entropy does not , in general , satisfy the well - known data processing inequality , nor is it in general convex in either of its arguments .",
    "nevertheless , there is a remarkable parallelism between relative entropy and relative @xmath0-entropy . in particular , they share the `` pythagorean property '' and behave like squared euclidean distance .",
    "this too was explored by sundaresan @xcite for the finite alphabet case , and we wish to extend the parallels to more general alphabet spaces . * we provide information on the structure of the rnyi entropy maximizer , under linear statistical constraints , whenever the maximizer exists .",
    "this can provide statistical physicists a quick means to check if their empirical observations in a particular physical setting conform to the maximum rnyi entropy principle .",
    "it also provides a means to estimate the appropriate @xmath0 for a particular physical setting .",
    "interestingly , the rnyi entropy maximizers belong to a `` power - law family '' of distributions that are the natural parametric generalizations of the shannon entropy maximizers , namely the exponential family of distributions . * in a companion paper , we shall show that a robust parameter estimation problem is a `` reverse @xmath1-projection '' problem , where the minimization is with respect to the _ second _ argument of @xmath1 .",
    "if this reverse projection is on a power - law family , then one may turn the reverse projection into a forward projection of a specific distribution on an appropriate linear family . in that paper",
    "we shall also explore the geometric relationship between the power - law and the linear families .",
    "* one may think of the maximum entropy principle or the minimization of relative entropy as a `` projection rule '' ; see section [ p1:sec : transitivity ] for projection rules with some desired properties .",
    "three of these properties are `` regularity '' , `` locality '' , and `` subspace - transitivity '' .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath1-based projection rule is regular , subspace - transitive when @xmath43 , but `` nonlocal '' . any regular , subspace - transitive , and local projection rule",
    "is generated by bregman s divergences of the sum - form @xcite . in our , as",
    "yet not very successful , attempt to characterize all regular , subspace - transitive , but possibly nonlocal projection rules , we wished to understand as much as we could about a particular nonlocal projection rule .",
    "the understanding we have gained may be of use to the wider community interested in axiomatic approaches to abstract inference problems .",
    "it is known ( see for example @xcite ) that @xmath36 is the more commonly studied rnyi divergence of order @xmath44 , not of the original measures @xmath4 and @xmath2 , but of their escort measures @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the normalization that makes @xmath45 a probability measure .",
    "@xmath46 is similarly defined . while the rnyi divergences arise naturally in hypothesis testing problems",
    "( see for example csiszr @xcite ) , @xmath1 arises more naturally as a redundancy for mismatched compression , as discussed earlier .",
    "moreover , @xmath36 is a certain monotone function of csiszr s @xmath26-divergence between @xmath45 and @xmath46 . as a consequence of the appearance of the escort measures ,",
    "the data - processing property satisfied by the @xmath26-divergences does not hold for the @xmath1-divergences .",
    "it is therefore all the more intriguing that it is neither the @xmath26-divergences nor the rnyi divergences but the @xmath1-divergences that share the pythagorean property with relative entropy .",
    "however , quite recently , van erven and harremos @xcite showed that rnyi divergences have a pythagorean property when the forward projection is on a so - called _ @xmath0-convex",
    "set_.    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ p1:sec : alpha_relative_entropy ] , we formally define @xmath1 and establish some of its basic algebraic and topological properties , those desired of an information divergence . in section [ p1:sec : projection ] , we establish the existence of @xmath1-projection on closed ( in an appropriate topology ) and convex sets .",
    "the proof for the case @xmath49 is analogous to that for relative entropy ( * ? ? ?",
    "the proof for the case @xmath50 exploits some functional analytic tools . in section [ p1:sec : pythagorenproperty ] , we present the pythagorean property in generality and derive some of its immediate consequences in connection with the forward projection . in section [ p1:sec : projection_for_linear_family ] , we characterize the forward @xmath1-projection on a linear family of probability measures , whenever it exists . in section [ p1:sec :",
    "transitivity ] , we establish a desirable subspace transitivity property and further prove the convergence of an iterative method for finding the forward @xmath1-projection on linear families . in the concluding",
    "section [ p1:sec : open - questions ] , we highlight some interesting open questions .",
    "the companion paper @xcite will explore the orthogonality between the power - law and the linear families , will exploit this orthogonality in a robust parameter estimation problem , and will study the reverse @xmath1-projection in detail .",
