    "the interaction of charge carriers with the crystal lattice is a fundamental ingredient for the description of materials .",
    "in addition to its role for superconductivity , electron - phonon coupling manifests itself in phenomena such as the peierls transition @xcite and polaron formation @xcite .",
    "electron - phonon coupling appears to play an important role in a number of strongly correlated materials such as the manganites @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , even a single electron coupled to quantum phonons represents a complex many - body problem @xcite , and systems with a finite band filling are even more demanding .",
    "much of our knowledge about the effects of electron - phonon coupling in low - dimensional systems comes from investigations of simplified microscopic models . among these models ,",
    "the holstein model @xcite and its generalizations play a central role .",
    "the focus on holstein - type models is a consequence of its relative simplicity , namely a density - displacement coupling and einstein phonons , which makes the models amenable to exact numerical methods such as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) or the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) ; for a review of existing work see ref .  .",
    "in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) case considered here , holstein - type models have also been studied with the bosonization method in combination with the renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite",
    ".    a critical look at the available literature reveals that , despite the substantial body of results , the understanding of the half - filled holstein and holstein - hubbard models is incomplete .",
    "apart from discrepancies in the critical values obtained with different numerical methods , there is a long - standing argument regarding the existence of a metallic phase .",
    "whereas more recent large - scale numerical studies @xcite support an extended metallic region as a result of quantum lattice fluctuations , similar to the spinless holstein model @xcite , earlier numerical and analytical results imply an insulating ground state for any nonzero electron - phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "a recent functional rg study confirmed the existence of an extended metallic region @xcite .",
    "complications also arise when trying to understand numerical results in terms of luttinger liquid theory .",
    "most notably , the numerically determined values of the luttinger parameter @xmath0 @xcite conflict with the observed behavior of the correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the fact that the electron - phonon interaction gives rise to a spin gap @xcite , so that the low - energy physics is described by the luther - emery fixed point @xcite .    here , we reveal the key role of the spin degrees of freedom for the observed inconsistencies .",
    "in addition to surveying previous results , we present new results for holstein and purely fermionic models .",
    "a comparison between spinful and spinless holstein models allows us to separate the effects of backscattering from retardation effects related to the lattice dynamics . on the other hand , transitions from a luttinger or luther - emery liquid to a cdw phase can also be investigated in numerically more accessible fermionic models , for which a quantitative comparison between theory and simulation is possible .",
    "the central findings of this work are as follows .",
    "( i ) previous claims for the absence of a metallic phase @xcite are shown to be unfounded .",
    "instead , the spinful holstein model seems to support a peierls transition at a nonzero critical electron - phonon coupling .",
    "( ii ) the metallic phase of the spinful holstein model is characterized by power - law ( dominant ) charge and ( subdominant ) pairing correlations , and exponentially suppressed spin correlations .",
    "( iii ) the spin gap caused by backscattering lies at the heart of the conflicts between numerics and theory .",
    "in particular , the expected luther - emery behavior is only observed on length scales larger than the inverse spin gap .",
    "( iv ) the pairing of electrons into spin singlets ( bipolarons ) provides a connection to the physics of the better understood spinless holstein model , and suggests that the correct low - energy picture of the holstein model is that of hard - core bosons with repulsive interactions .",
    "the latter problem can be solved exactly , and provides a natural explanation for the existence of an extended metallic region in the holstein model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the relevant models .",
    "the qmc methods are briefly explained in sec .",

    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions , and the appendix gives the derivation of the scaling behavior of the charge susceptibility .",
    "the 1d holstein model is defined as @xcite @xmath1 the first term describes the hopping of electrons between neighboring lattice sites with amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "the second term describes the lattice degrees of freedom in the harmonic approximation ; the phonon frequency is given by @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the lattice displacement ( momentum ) at site @xmath6 . the electron - phonon interaction described by the third term couples the electron density at site @xmath6 with the lattice distortion at the same site .",

    "we simulated the models defined in sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] with two different qmc methods .",
    "first , we made use of the continuous - time interaction expansion ( ct - int ) method @xcite which has been successfully applied to electron - phonon lattice models @xcite .",
    "the phonons are integrated out analytically , and the resulting fermionic model with nonlocal ( i.e. , retarded ) interactions is simulated @xcite .",
    "we refer to previous publications @xcite and reviews @xcite for technical details .",
    "second , we used the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) representation @xcite , which in principle provides a more favorable linear ( as compared to cubic for the ct - int method ) scaling of computer time with system size @xmath29 and inverse temperature @xmath30 .",
    "it was previously applied to the holstein - hubbard model @xcite . for the holstein model , the phonons",
    "have been treated explicitly in the occupation number basis . in order to avoid negative vertex weights , a cut - off on the maximum phonon occupation",
    "needs to be imposed .",
    "however , unlike exact diagonalization or dmrg methods , the computational effort scales only linearly in the phonon cut - off , allowing us to choose it sufficiently large to make the resulting systematic errors completely negligible .",
    "while the employed update scheme is inherently grand - canonical , measurements were restricted to half - filled configurations . )",
    "for which @xmath31 corresponds to half - filling , we used @xmath32 and a chemical potential @xmath33    in the sse representation , the directed loops algorithm @xcite allows us to update the purely fermionic models very efficiently and to reach significantly larger system sizes compared to the ct - int method .",
    "in contrast , the phononic operators of the holstein model are updated by exchanging pairs of phonon creation and annihilation operators on the same site with diagonal electronic operators , and vice versa , with metropolis probabilities @xcite .",
    "the number of diagonal phonon operators between the pair enters the acceptance probabilities as an exponent .",
    "thus , in the nonadiabatic regime , @xmath34 , the acceptance rates for phononic updates are exponentially suppressed , leading to prolonged autocorrelation times .",
    "this can be remedied to some extent by the use of quantum parallel tempering @xcite .",
    "still , for @xmath35 we found that the ct - int method is in fact competitive .",
    "we measured the real - space correlation functions in the charge , pairing , and spin channels , @xmath36 here @xmath37 , and the pairing operator is given by @xmath38 in the spinful case , and by @xmath39 in the spinless case .",
    "we also consider the corresponding structure factors obtained via fourier transformation , @xmath40",
    "we begin with an overview of important previous results for the half - filled holstein model .",
    "the reason for focusing on the pure holstein model is that it features only one phase transition , whereas the holstein - hubbard model exhibits mott and peierls transitions @xcite .",
    "a variety of numerical methods have been applied to the half - filled holstein model , most notably exact diagonalization @xcite and qmc methods @xcite , as well as the dmrg @xcite .",
    "the first study was carried out using a qmc algorithm @xcite . based on results for the real - space charge correlation function , and reassured by",
    "approximate analytical arguments , it was claimed that the spinful holstein model at half - filling is a peierls insulator for any finite phonon frequency @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec : metallicphase ] that this conclusion was incorrect .",
    "accordingly , all ensuing numerical works suggest that the model instead has an extended metallic phase where quantum lattice fluctuations destroy the dimerized peierls state below a critical value of the electron - phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "the numerical phase diagrams @xcite agree with respect to the overall features but , as discussed below , there are nonnegligible differences regarding the phase boundaries . despite these quantitative uncertainties ,",
    "the dmrg and qmc results rather firmly establish the existence of a phase transition from a spin - gapped metallic phase to a charge - ordered insulating phase with increasing electron - phonon coupling .",
    "interest in the holstein(-hubbard ) model revived when qmc simulations @xcite suggested the existence of a metallic phase with dominant pairing correlations , as indicated by a luttinger parameter @xmath42 .",
    "however , it was soon shown that for @xmath43 charge correlations always decay slower than pairing correlations @xcite .",
    "this conflict between the numerical values of @xmath0 and the behavior of the correlation functions has not been resolved .",
    "an important property of the metallic phase is the existence of a spin gap , first pointed out in ref .  , which arises from the pairing of electrons into spin singlets .",
    "in the language of bosonization , the spin gap is caused by attractive backscattering of electrons , similar to the attractive hubbard model .",
    "a detailed discussion of the spin gap can be found in ref .  .",
    "the most compelling evidence for a spin gap is the dominance of charge correlations over spin correlations , which is not possible in a gapless luttinger liquid @xcite but observed in the holstein model in the entire metallic phase @xcite , as well as the numerical finding of a luttinger parameter @xmath44 incompatible with the su(2 ) spin symmetry of the holstein model @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : correlations ] ) . an important corollary of the existence of a spin gap in the metallic phase is that the relevant fixed point in the thermodynamic limit is not the luttinger liquid but the luther - emery liquid , which is much more difficult to analyze .      in the static ( classical phonon or adiabatic )",
    "limit @xmath45 a mean - field ansatz @xmath46 reveals the peierls instability inherent to 1d systems without quantum fluctuations . because the energy gain outweighs the cost for dimerization , any nonzero electron - phonon coupling leads to an insulating peierls state .",
    "this conclusion holds for both the spinful and the spinless holstein model . in the opposite , anti - adiabatic limit @xmath19",
    ", the holstein model can be mapped to the attractive hubbard model with an instantaneous interaction @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the half - filled attractive hubbard model is metallic for any @xmath16 , and has a spin gap @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the effective backscattering matrix element @xcite . while representing valuable limiting cases , neither the static ( @xmath45 ) nor the instantaneous ( @xmath19 ) limit captures the theoretical problem of electrons coupled to quantum phonons .    the strong - coupling approximation presented by hirsch and fradkin @xcite starts from electrons paired into spin singlets and considers the effect of second - order hopping processes to derive an effective hardcore boson model with pair hopping @xmath50 and nearest - neighbor repulsion @xmath51 , both functions of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the strong - coupling results give @xmath54 for any @xmath41 which , according to the bosonization results for hardcore bosons , implies that the system is in an insulating , charge - ordered phase for any @xmath43 .",
    "in contrast , a similar approximation for the spinless holstein model gives @xmath55 .",
    "[ interestingly , the same difference between the spinful and spinless cases is also predicted for the su - schrieffer - heeger model .",
    "in contrast to the holstein model , these analytical predictions ( @xmath55 for the spinless model , @xmath56 for the spinful model ) have been confirmed by numerical simulations , see ref .   and references therein . ]",
    "the strong - coupling approximation highlights the relation of the spinful holstein model to hardcore bosons ( corresponding to electron pairs ) , but is considered to be unreliable in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "in particular , for sufficiently small @xmath52 , the approximation of electron pairs as hardcore , onsite objects breaks down .",
    "instead , the system may be regarded as consisting of interacting singlet bipolarons whose size depends on @xmath52 and @xmath57 .    because we are considering a 1d system ,",
    "important insights can be gained from the bosonization method together with the rg . for electron - phonon models ,",
    "such an approach involves an additional approximation .",

    "[ fig : uv2 ] , we show results for @xmath146 in the insulating cdw phase ( @xmath230 ) . for @xmath213 , the spin gap is not resolved in the luther - emery phase for @xmath21 ( see fig .  [",

    "the minimum at intermediate @xmath29 persists for slightly larger @xmath231 ( but is shifted to smaller @xmath29 because the spin gap increases with increasing @xmath231 ) , whereas for large @xmath231 the gap is large enough to be resolved even for small @xmath29 . for these parameters ( e.g. , @xmath220 ) , @xmath146 is monotonic and exhibits a clear divergence . because @xmath146 even diverges ( logarithmically ) in the metallic phase for @xmath232 ( see fig .",

    "numerical results for the correlation functions reveal that in the spinful holstein model at half - filling , charge correlations dominate over pairing correlations down to very small values of the electron - phonon coupling @xcite . at the same time , spin correlations are suppressed relative to charge correlations @xcite . for a 1d metallic system , this necessarily implies a gap for spin excitations @xcite , consistent with the observation of @xmath233 @xcite .",
    "the gap arises from the pairing of electrons into spin singlets ( bipolarons ) or , in the language of bosonization , from attractive backscattering which is a relevant perturbation of the tomonaga - luttinger fixed point .",
    "the spin gap makes the luther - emery liquid the relevant fixed point for a low - energy description of the metallic phase , and significantly complicates the analysis of numerical data because a crossover from the luttinger to the luther - emery fixed point takes place as a function of distance . for distances smaller than the inverse spin gap ,",
    "correlation functions resemble those of a gapless luttinger liquid , whereas for large distances the corresponding luther - emery results are approached . because the spin gap is small in the metallic phase for typical phonon frequencies , it appears highly nontrivial to reach the correct low - energy fixed point numerically .",
    "importantly , the exponents for charge and pairing correlations are expected to change in the same way when the spin gap is resolved , leaving the conclusion that the metallic phase is a repulsive luther - emery liquid unchanged .",
    "the fixed - point crossover and the complications in determining the luttinger parameters and the phase boundary are absent in the spinless holstein and @xmath2-@xmath17 models .    assuming that the spin gap in the holstein model is roughly determined by the corresponding attractive hubbard interaction @xmath47 , the critical values @xmath234 ( for @xmath88 ) and @xmath137 ( for @xmath136 ) translate into @xmath213 and @xmath235 , respectively .",
    "hence , the results for the attractive hubbard model in fig .  [ fig : attractivehubbard2 ] should be representative of the largest spin gaps in the metallic phase of the holstein model for typical phonon frequencies , and suggest that the luther - emery regime will be hard to reach numerically ( e.g. , for @xmath213 , @xmath207 sites are not sufficient ) .",
    "if system sizes are too small , correlation functions will not display the expected behavior .",
    "the numerical finding of @xmath42 in the metallic phase has motivated much of the recent work on the holstein model .",
    "initial claims of dominant pairing correlations turned out to be incorrect , and the system instead exhibits dominant charge correlations suggestive of @xmath236 .",
    "we have shown that the inconsistent values of @xmath0 can not be explained by retardation effects ( @xmath0 deviates even more from 1 for higher phonon frequencies ) . instead ,",
    "because very similar problems arise in simulations of the attractive hubbard model , we attribute the complications to backscattering and the spin gap .",
    "while theories of metal - insulator transitions in luther - emery liquids are less controlled than for luttinger liquids @xcite , a consistent picture of the spinful holstein model is in terms of interacting bipolarons that order into a cdw state at @xmath82 .",
    "such a description was previously suggested for the extended hubbard model @xcite , and also emerges from a strong - coupling approximation of the holstein model @xcite . for simplicity , we focus the discussion on hard - core bosons , although bipolarons in the holstein model can also be extended .    adopting the bosonic picture ,",
    "the bosonization and rg methods predict metallic behavior ( reflected in a vanishing two - particle electronic charge gap ) for @xmath237 ( we drop the index @xmath93 when referring to the bosonic picture ) . similar to spinless fermions , a metallic phase with dominant charge correlations and subdominant pairing correlations exists for @xmath238 . at @xmath239 ,",
    "a mott transition to an insulating cdw state takes place .",
    "clearly , the bosonic picture provides a strong connection to the spinless holstein model , where the luttinger liquid to peierls insulator transition may be understood in terms of a mott transition of spinless fermions .",
    "the value of @xmath106 at the peierls transition in the spinful holstein model is not known from theory ( the assumption of @xmath107 in ref",
    ".   seems unjustified because there is no cancellation of interactions at @xmath82 ) .",
    "the transition from a luther - emery to a cdw phase was studied for the @xmath16-@xmath17 extended hubbard model , where the symmetries for @xmath21 imply that the critical value is @xmath107 .",
    "however , the bosonic low - energy theory of the holstein model contains an interaction between pairs of electrons , and we therefore expect a different scaling dimension and critical @xmath240 .",
    "additionally , the role of quantum lattice fluctuations needs to be addressed .",
    "indeed , recent functional rg results for the holstein model @xcite confirm the existence of a finite metallic region .    for numerical investigations of the holstein model , it is important to recognize that the system size has to be sufficiently large to resolve the spin gap in order to allow for a meaningful comparison with the bosonic picture .",
    "the electronic luttinger parameter @xmath106 may in general not have a simple relation to the @xmath240 of the bosonic picture .",
    "of particular interest is a numerical calculation of bosonic pairing and density correlation functions .",
    "the latter would permit to test the bosonic picture and the corresponding bosonization results ( including the transition at @xmath239 ) quantitatively .",
    "we carried out extensive quantum monte carlo simulations to resolve conflicts regarding the existence of a metallic phase and the value to the luttinger parameter @xmath106 in the one - dimensional spinful holstein model at half - filling .",
    "in addition , we considered the spinless holstein model and minimal fermionic models that capture the charge - density - wave transition .",
    "first , we showed that the results of ref .",
    "are partly incorrect ( likely due to autocorrelations ) , and should hence not be regarded as evidence for the absence of a metallic phase in the holstein model , in accordance with recent functional renormalization group results that predict a nonzero critical electron - phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "our results for the real - space correlation functions in the metallic phase are consistent with luttinger liquid physics for the spinless holstein model , and luther - emery physics for the spinful holstein model . in the latter case ,",
    "spin correlations are suppressed with respect to charge correlations due to the existence of a spin gap , although the gap is typically not fully resolved in numerical simulations . in both models ,",
    "charge correlations dominate over pairing correlations , which suggests predominantly repulsive interactions .",
    "given a metallic phase at weak coupling , we investigated in detail how the spin gap manifests itself in finite - size simulations . by comparing results for the spinful and the spinless holstein model , as well as for fermionic models",
    ", we revealed that complications in accurately determining @xmath106 appear to be generic for spin - gapped phases , but independent of retardation effects . as a function of distance ,",
    "correlation functions reveal a crossover from luttinger liquid behavior at short distances to luther - emery behavior at long distances .",
    "a nonzero spin gap also affects the possibility of using the charge susceptibility to track the peierls transition , which may explain existing deviations between phase boundaries in the literature .",
    "our results and analysis of previous work suggest that even with state - of - the - art numerical methods the paradigmatic spinful holstein and holstein - hubbard models remain challenging .",
    "finally , our work motivates further numerical and analytical investigations . on the numerical side",
    ", it would be useful to find alternative ways to determine the critical value of the peierls transition , and to measure bosonic correlation functions to verify the low - energy description in terms of bipolarons .",
    "on the theoretical side , an improved understanding of the origin of logarithmic corrections to @xmath106 , and of the mott transition in a generic luther - emery liquid would be desirable .",
