    "the discovery of x - ray afterglow emission with the narrow - field instruments of the bepposax satellite ( costa  1997 ) has given a dramatic boost to both , observations and theoretical investigations of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) over the last few months .",
    "in particular , this finding has triggered a wealth of rapid follow - up observations in the x - ray , optical , infrared and radio bands .",
    "this has even lead to the development of a strategy of localizing the x - ray afterglow of strong grbs with non - imaging x - ray instruments ( scanning with the pca onboard rxte ) .",
    "also , a procedure has been set up to recognize when individual dwells of the rxte all - sky monitor cover batse burst locations and to derive arcmin size locations within a few hours ( smith  1998 ) .",
    "x - ray follow up observations are primarily performed with the asca and rosat satellites . while asca s unique strengths are the very rapid response time ( 12 days ) and the high spectral resolution of its x - ray ccd camera ( murakami  1998 ) , rosat can provide arcsec positioning and , due to its superb sensitivity , a rather long lever arm for studying the x - ray intensity decay up to 14 days after a grb . here",
    "i sumarize some results which have been obtained over the last months with rapid rosat follow - up observations of well localized grb error boxes .",
    "other areas of grb research with rosat can be found elsewhere , such as the investigation of small ipn error boxes using the rosat all - sky survey data in bor  ( 1994 ) , a summary of all rosat pointings on grb error boxes and a correlation of grb locations with serendipituous rosat pointings in greiner ( 1997 ) .",
    "motivated by the occurrence of a few very long lasting grbs and by the detection of distinct spectral softening over the burst duration several attempts have been made in the past to observe well - localized grbs with rosat as quick as possible after the grb event in the hope to find the `` smoking gun '' . to this end ,",
    "the grb had to be localized accurately ( to fit the field of view ) and quickly , and the grb location had to be within the rosat observing window ( @xmath030% of the sky at any moment ) . in retrospective , these rosat observations were done not quick enough and/or with too short exposure times .",
    "beginning with grb 970228 and the establishment of the approximate 1/t x - ray intensity decay law , rosat observations were sensitive enough to detect the x - ray afterglow of ( some ) grbs .",
    "since then , every grb with a location inside the rosat viewing zone has been observed with rosat as quick as possible .",
    "we note , that grbs 970402 and 970508 were not observable for rosat due to solar angle constraints .",
    "in several cases , even a second follow - up observation has been performed to allow a variability check of the detected x - ray sources . tab .",
