    "recently the study of the nonequilibrium processes of deposit formation became one of the most active research areas in physics and chemistry because of both fundamental and practical interest @xcite .",
    "the essential progress in this field was reached owing to application of computer simulations methods for studying the problems of adsorption , formation of thin films and coating .",
    "there exists a limited number of computer models , allowing to carry out effective calculations and to establish the main scaling laws for formation of deposits @xcite .    among the most popular models for deposit formation simulation are the models of random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) , ballistic deposition ( bd ) and random deposition ( rd ) @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the particles get fixed after deposition and do nt move , so these models describe the growth processes far from equilibrium .",
    "it is also assumed that particles are rigid and can not overlap . in rsa model ,",
    "particles get fixed at some distance one from another @xcite . in rsa model with the nearest neighbor ( nn ) exclusion , configurations with the particles having nearest neighbors are eliminated .",
    "in fact , it means existence of some repulsion between particles . in rsa model ,",
    "all sites in the lattice can be filled with equal probability . however , this requirement is not fulfilled on deposit formation . in this case",
    ", the previously deposited particles can screen free sites , located below .",
    "so , we named the variant of rsa model for deposit formation as rsa deposition model ( rsad ) . in bd model ,",
    "the particles stick at the point of their first contact .",
    "it means existence of the short - range attraction . in rd model , the particles deposit without sticking and it means existence of the short - range repulsion .",
    "recently , a number of mixed or competitive models were proposed .",
    "they are based on consideration of deposition for different kinds of particles @xcite    in this work , the competitive ( 2 + 1)-dimensional model with three kinds of particles , depositing according to the rules of random sequential absorption deposition ( rsad ) , ballistic deposition ( bd ) and random deposition ( rd ) , is investigated .",
    "this model allows to explore a wide class of systems with different interparticle interactions , which vary from a complete repulsion as for rsad model to short - range attraction as for bd model .",
    "the paper is organized as follow .",
    "the model is described in section [ model ] . in section",
    "[ results ] , the scaling behaviour of the deposit density and concentration of the structure defects are discussed for different values of the competitive model parameters . concluding remarks are presented in section [ conclusions ]",
    "the competitive ( 2 + 1)-dimensional model , which combines models of the random sequential adsorption deposition ( rsad ) , ballistic deposition ( bd ) and random deposition ( rd ) , named by as rsad @xmath0 ( rd@xmath1bd@xmath2)@xmath18 , where @xmath13 and @xmath19 parameters are fractions of particles with different kinds of interparticle short - range interaction potentials .",
    "a particle of rsad or bd or rd kind randomly falls straight down onto a growing surface , one at a time , and deposits at a site of the cubic lattice .",
    "parameter @xmath13 characterizes the short - ranged next - near - neighbor repulsion of particles in the deposit , and parameter @xmath14 characterizes adhesion of particles . in the extreme case of @xmath20",
    "all the particles are of rsad kind .",
    "this case corresponds to the strong repulsion between particles in nn sites and they can deposit only in the next nn sites .",
    "when @xmath21 , @xmath22 , all the particle are of bd kind and newcomer sticks to the deposits at a point of its first contact .",
    "when @xmath23 , @xmath24 , all the particle are of rd kind .",
    "this case corresponds to existence of the short - ranged repulsion between particles and formation of completely compact deposits .",
    "the density of a deposit may be defined as @xmath25 where n is the number of deposited particles , and @xmath26 is the volume of deposit .",
    "the value of @xmath10 is calculated at a moment when saturation was reached in the system with the volume @xmath27 . at this moment , filling of the system with new particles was terminated .    for rsad model ,",
    "the structure of deposit becomes more regular at large deposit height @xmath9 , and in the extreme case of @xmath28 , the ideal checkerboard - ordered structure get formed . in this ideal structure , the empty lattice sites alternate with occupied ones and each empty ( or occupied ) site has exactly @xmath29 occupied ( or empty ) nn sites .",
    "but at small values of @xmath9 there exist some defects in the regular structure ( fig .",
    "[ f01 ] ) , when nn exclusion number @xmath30 is different from 6 .",
    "the concentration of defects @xmath31 may be defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the nn exclusion number averaged over all the occupied and empty sites in the horizontal layer with the constant @xmath9 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are applied along the horizontal directions @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the size of the base @xmath11 was varied within the interval of @xmath36 and deposit height was @xmath37 .",
    "the values of @xmath10 and @xmath38 were averaged over @xmath39 of different configurations for each fixed set of parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "at the beginning we studied the scaling behavior of the deposit density @xmath10 in cubes with varying sizes @xmath42 .",
    "a clear scaling law of the following type was observed : @xmath43 here , @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the scaling exponent and @xmath46 is the amplitude .",
    "figure [ f02 ] shows @xmath15 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 versus @xmath13 dependencies at different values of @xmath14 .",
    "as we have noted previously , for rsad model ( @xmath4 ) in the limits of @xmath47 and @xmath8 the ideal checkerboard ordered structure get formed , that corresponds to @xmath48 . with increasing of @xmath13",
    "when @xmath14 is a constant the density of a deposit @xmath15 always goes through the minimum at @xmath49 . the value of @xmath50 increases with decreasing of @xmath14 .",
    "the point of @xmath6 and @xmath7 corresponds to a pure bd model for which @xmath51 ( this value in accordance with data @xcite ) .",
    "the point of @xmath6 and @xmath52 corresponds to the pure rd model , when @xmath53 and compact deposit forms .    at first glance , the @xmath15 versus @xmath13 behavior is somewhat anomalous",
    ". really , the effective repulsion between particles decreases with increase of @xmath13 ( at constant @xmath14 ) .",
    "so , we should expect compacting of deposit and increase of @xmath15 .",
    "another interesting feature is that the scaling exponent @xmath45 decreases abruptly with @xmath13 decrease in the interval of @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , we observe two different scaling regimes with large and small values of scaling exponent @xmath45 . for the pure rsad model ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "scaling exponent is @xmath55 . in a regime",
    "far from pure rsad model , the scaling exponent falls within the interval of @xmath56 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath46 continuously grows with @xmath13 increase and it approaches zero at @xmath54 , which results in large errors of @xmath45 estimation ( see insert in fig .",
    "[ f02 ] ) .",
    "the nature of unusual behavior of the deposit density @xmath15 with variation of @xmath13 may be understood more clearly from the analysis of defects evolution during the deposit growth .",
    "the initial abrupt decreasing of the deposit density with @xmath13 increase ( at @xmath57 ) reflects generation of defects in the ideal checkerboard - ordered structure .",
    "naturally this results in loosening of the structure of deposit .",
    "the point of density minimum at @xmath58 corresponds to a kind of equilibrium between the processes of birth and vanishing of defects . with further @xmath59 increase , effectiveness of regeneration of the ideal checkerboard - ordered structure decreases .",
    "finally , it results in increase of @xmath15 with @xmath13 increase .",
    "the described behavior of @xmath15 can be compared with behavior of the concentration of defects @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ f03 ] shows the typical map of the defect annihilation heights in the plane of @xmath61 for the pure rsad model . here",
    ", the lighter color corresponds to the higher deposit coordinate @xmath30 , at which defects disappear in the ideal rsad structure .    at initial moment of deposit formation , there arise a lot of defects in the ideal rsad structure .",
    "this is a result of the absence of correlations between deposition in the columns at small height of the deposit .",
    "these defects can spread in the direction of deposit formation along @xmath62 axis and their concentration in each layer @xmath63 increases or decreases owing to the processes of defect birth ( at @xmath64 ) or annihilation , respectively .",
    "figure [ f04 ] shows the examples of defects concentration @xmath65 versus deposit height @xmath9 dependences for the case when @xmath52 .",
    "the similar dependences were also observed for other values of @xmath14 .    for pure rsad model ( @xmath66 ) the concentration of defects @xmath67 continuously decreases with increase of the deposit height @xmath9 .",
    "in the limit of @xmath68 the defectless checkerboard - ordered structure get formed . in the latter case ,",
    "the obvious scaling behavior of @xmath69 dependencies is observed for systems with different size of base @xmath11 .",
    "we believe that a simple power law can be applied for description of @xmath69 behavior in the limit of @xmath70 @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the scaling exponent of defects annihilation for the pure rsad model .",
    "this behaviour is rather similar to the critical annihilation of inter - domain boundaries in the model of competitive growth by saito and muller - krumbhaar ( smk ) @xcite ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "prediction of the scaling exponent in critical annihilation is not trivial . for normal brownian motion of annihilating defects the scaling exponent should be @xmath73 @xcite . in @xmath74 dimensional smk - model another scaling exponent @xmath75 @xcite was observed .",
    "this result was explained by existence of different mechanisms of the critical annihilation of defects in smk and random walk motion models .",
    "it was conjectured that the lateral displacements of inter - domain boundaries in the smk model are controlled by the same processes as those causing roughening the outer interface width and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the roughening exponent . on the other hand",
    ", the value of @xmath77 can reflect the growth mechanism , geometrical confinement of growing interface , space dimension , etc.@xcite .",
    "for example , for usual models of kpz class of universality @xcite the roughening exponent is @xmath78 in @xmath74 dimension and is @xmath79 in @xmath80 dimension @xcite .    for pure rsad model ( @xmath66 ) and an isotropic system ( @xmath81 ) , we can estimate the value of the scaling exponent in eq .",
    "[ nheq ] as @xmath82 , where @xmath55 is the scaling exponent for the density of deposit in eq .",
    "indeed , we believe that the scaling changes in the deposit density @xmath10 and in the concentration of defects @xmath65 are controlled by the same process , and @xmath83 . the dashed line in fig",
    ". [ f04 ] corresponds to the slope , estimated from scaling of the deposit density .",
    "but for anisotropic systems @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , the concentration of defects decrease more quickly than it is predicted by the power law in eq .",
    "[ nheq ] , and the most obvious deviations are observed with increase of the system anisotropy degree at high @xmath9 ( see fig.[f04 ] ) .    in a general case of the competitive model rsad @xmath0 ( rd@xmath1bd@xmath2)@xmath3 , the patterns of defect distributions in a deposit can be more complicated . here , defects can birth or can vanish and competition between these processes results in formation of a certain defected structure with the finite concentration of defects . for mixed model at @xmath86 , the critical behavior of ( [ nheq ] ) type disappears . in the limit of indefinitely large @xmath9 ( @xmath87 ) ,",
    "the concentration of defects remain finite and has a nonzero value @xmath88 . with @xmath13 increase , which corresponds to the weakening of repulsion between the particles , increase of @xmath88",
    "is observed ( see insert in fig.[f04 ] ) , and in the limit of pure rd model , ( @xmath6 , @xmath52 ) , @xmath89 , because deposit is compact in rd model and even local checkerboard - ordered structure is absent .",
    "it was demonstrated that implementation of the rsa rules for 3d- growth of deposit on a cubic lattice with the nearest - neighbor exclusions results in formation of a checkerboard - ordered structure .",
    "the initial disorder of this structure critically disappears when the deposit grows and , finally , an ideal checkerboard - ordered structure gets formed . in a competitive rsad@xmath0(rd@xmath1bd@xmath2)@xmath3 model",
    ", the deposit density goes through the minimum with variation of @xmath13 parameter at constant @xmath14 .",
    "such behavior reflects the influence of competitive processes related with the birth and annihilation of defects .",
