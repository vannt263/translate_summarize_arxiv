    "the mechanical behaviour of a flowing granular material depends strongly on the grain compaction .",
    "while dense granular media usually exhibit relatively slow motions with predominance of friction , less dense ones are usually found in vigorous motions with predominance of two - particles collisions .",
    "the collision - dominated regime is well described by kinetic theory , with the concepts of granular temperature and inelastic collisions . on the contrary ,",
    "the current description of dense granular flows is not so fully satisfactory .",
    "it must be understood that we are not questioning the description by soil mechanics of quasi - static and highly stressed granular materials , but the description of flows with relatively low stress levels encountered , for example , in avalanches down an inclined plane .",
    "several recent works ( see e.g. @xcite ) concluded rather pessimistically about the possibility of describing dense granular flows within the realm of continuum mechanics .",
    "in fact , the experimental observation that most dense flows display a typical thickness of a few grain diameters must not be a factor of pessimism .",
    "we know from several examples in suspension mechanics that the continuum approach can cope with high velocity gradients in one direction , provided one has some statistical homogeneity in the other two directions .",
    "this situation is exactly the one met in sheared granular media , provided we discard transient effects and focus on the final stationary state .",
    "once the continuum description is accepted , the number of relevant field variables must be decided .",
    "there is no doubt that the grain velocity is relevant and it is not less clear that the grain compaction is also a pertinent variable .",
    "in fact the widely used assumption of an incompressible medium is not tenable .",
    "it contradicts the dilatancy concept and , as will be seen below , the transport coefficients of a dense granular medium display enormous variations with only tiny modifications of the compaction .",
    "our aim is thus to propose a model for dense and stationary shear flows in which the grain compaction and the grain velocity are the two fundamental variables .",
    "one could also suggest the fluctuational kinetic energy of the grains ( the granular `` temperature '' ) as a third variable .",
    "however , since we limit our analysis to stationary shears , the granular temperature is no longer an independent variable .",
    "the role of the embedding fluid will be neglected everywhere , and for these `` dry '' granular media , the main issue is to propose a constitutive relation for the granular stress . to compare with previous works on dense flows , we can say we adopt a phenomenological description somewhat similar to that proposed two decades ago by savage @xcite and by johnson and jackson @xcite . like these authors",
    ", we introduce a stress tensor split into a frictional and a collisional contribution .",
    "however , the collisional contribution is concerned with rebound - less impacts characteristic of high grain concentration , and is free of any restitution coefficient .",
    "our constitutive relation for the particulate stress has a form somewhat similar to that proposed by ancey and evesque @xcite , the main differences concerning the role of the grain compaction and a more detailed expression of the granular pressure .",
    "our model also shares some common features with the model proposed by bocquet et al .",
    "@xcite and by louge @xcite , but instead of extending the kinetic theory approach to large compaction , we prefer here to develop a model specifically devoted to dense media .",
    "moreover , the model we propose is quite simple in so far as it denies any special role to the compaction gradient @xcite and avoids the non - locality concept @xcite .    discarding two - particles collisions and",
    "any restitution coefficient means that our model is restricted to volume fractions in the range between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the maximum grain compaction @xmath1 corresponds to the highest possible random packing ( with @xmath2 for two - dimensional flows and @xmath3 for three - dimensional ones ) while @xmath0 is the smallest compaction compatible with the existence of a continuous network of contacts between grains . as suggested by azanza @xcite",
    ", one can define @xmath4 as the minimum compaction for which the two - particle distribution function exhibits some swelling at a distance of _ two _ diameters . with this definition , @xmath5 for two - dimensional flows while @xmath6 for three - dimensional ones .",
    "a phenomenological order parameter description of granular media was recently proposed @xcite .",
    "we acknowledge this approach looks efficient in describing a large number of phenomena observed in dense flows , but it suffers from two serious drawbacks .",
    "the first one is the huge number of possible candidates for the order parameter .",
    "for example , in the model to be presented below , the reduced compaction @xmath7 could play this role .",
    "a second difficulty concerns the relevance of the ginzburg - landau relaxation equation for the order parameter . here",
    "we consider the standard conservation of mass and momentum only , without any extra equation .    the description of stationary free - surface shear flows is given in section [ sex : free ] while that of confined shear flows is presented in section [ sex : con ] .",
    "section [ sex : exp ] compares the model predictions with experimental and ( or ) numerical data .",
    "the final section insists on the limitations and necessary improvements of the proposed model , which must be considered as a minimal one .",
    "as a prototype of shear flow with free surface , we consider the gravity - induced chute ( over a heap or an inclined plate , see figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) with an angle @xmath8 relative to the horizontal plane .",
    "the mean grain velocity is parallel to the @xmath9-axis , @xmath10 , while @xmath11 and the solid fraction @xmath12 depend only on @xmath13 , the _ distance to the free surface_. the granular stress tensor is noted @xmath14 and the equations of motion are :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the constant mass per unit volume of the grain material and @xmath17 is the acceleration of gravity .    for dense granular media ,",
    "the granular stress is a consequence of long - lived contacts and bounce - less impacts between grains .",
    "long - lived contacts result from compressive forces acting towards the boundaries of the granular medium . in the geometry",
    "considered , they take part in @xmath18 since @xmath13 is the direction of main compression . whether gravity is responsible for compressive forces or not , we choose to scale the compressive stress with @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the grain size .",
    "the compressive stresses are related to the grain volume fraction as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the non - dimensional compressibility of the granular medium . in free - surface shear flows",
    ", gravity is the only source of compaction and the magnitude of the compressive stress will also depend on @xmath8 .",
    "it is clear that the compressive role of gravity is maximum when the compression axis @xmath13 is vertical while this role vanishes when gravity is orthogonal to it .",
    "consequently , the general form of the gravity - induced compressive stress is @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25= 0 .",
    "the exact expression of @xmath26 is not important because , as will soon be seen , the stationary flows exist in a very limited range of @xmath8 only",
    ". one of the simplest function of @xmath8 which meets the above requirement is @xmath27 , and we assume henceforth that the contribution of long - lived contacts to @xmath18 can be written in the form @xmath28 . to this gravity - induced contact stress must be added a rate - dependent impact stress . on purely dimensional grounds , this second contribution can not be but bagnold - like and the full normal stress finally appears in the form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the compaction - dependent intensity of the normal stress induced by the shear rate .",
    "concerning the shear stress of the flowing granular medium , we assume it is made of a coulomb - like contribution with a friction coefficient @xmath31 completed by a bagnold - like contribution involving a coefficient @xmath32 representing the compaction - dependent intensity of the shear stress induced by the shear rate @xmath33 the model expressions ( [ tzz ] ) and ( [ txz ] ) contain four functions of the grain compaction . before giving them some explicit ( and tentative ) expressions , let us comment on their expected general behaviour .",
    "these four functions are characteristic of the dense regime and have a meaning in the range @xmath34 only .",
    "we expect @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 to become infinite when @xmath38 , because no motion nor extra compaction is expected above the maximum random packing .",
    "we also expect @xmath35 and @xmath37 to vanish for @xmath39 , because the normal stresses must vanish for the most tenuous contact network . concerning the friction coefficient @xmath40 , it is the only coefficient which remains finite when @xmath41 and it presumably increases @xcite for smaller compactions . in short , the three scalars @xmath35 , @xmath37 and @xmath36 are strongly increasing functions of the compaction , while @xmath40 has a much smoother behaviour .",
    "since we neglect the role of the embedding fluid , the granular stress must vanish at the free surface and consequently @xmath42 everywhere . in this case , when solving the equations of motion ( [ stress ] ) with the model expressions ( [ tzz ] ) and ( [ txz ] ) , one arrives at a compaction profile and a velocity profile which are solution of : @xmath43 } \\label{dens}\\ ] ] and @xmath44 at the free - surface the solid fraction is @xmath0 ( remember we limit the description to the dense regime ) . according to ( [ dens ] ) the solid fraction increases towards its maximum value @xmath1 over a depth which scales with the grain diameter but depends on @xmath45 if @xmath46 is different from zero .",
    "hence @xmath46 represents the relative magnitude of reynold s dilatancy .",
    "concerning the velocity profile , its characteristic value scales like @xmath47 and according to ( [ velo ] ) its solution exists for any angle @xmath8 verifying the inequality @xmath48 .",
    "for certain values of @xmath8 this inequality is possibly satisfied in a part only of the full range @xmath49 .",
    "it is obviously not evident to deduce four functions of the compaction from the rather scarce experimental or numerical results on stationary shear flows .",
    "_ we assume henceforth that _ @xmath40 and @xmath50 _ are independent of the grain compaction_. then , a stationary solution is possible in a well - defined angle range @xmath51 , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 . to obtain more quantitative results",
    "we consider separately the chute over a heap from that over an inclined plane .      in the heap case ,",
    "provided @xmath40 and @xmath46 are independant of the solid fraction , one can deduce from ( [ dens ] ) and ( [ velo ] ) the total granular flux flowing down the heap @xmath54 : @xmath55 the grain velocity @xmath56 at the free surface @xmath57 and the relative velocity profile @xmath58 since the free - surface velocity and the flux are expected to have finite values for @xmath59 , the two functions @xmath60 and @xmath32 must be such as to guarantee the convergence of the above integrals . in this case @xmath56 and @xmath54 are function of @xmath8 with numerical prefactors depending on one s peculiar choice for @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in what follows we adopt the simple expressions @xmath61 the same expression for @xmath35 was already proposed by savage @xcite and leads to an exponential - like volume fraction profile : @xmath62 with @xmath63 @xmath64 represents the typical thickness of the layer flowing down the heap , and it increases from @xmath65 to infinity when @xmath66 .",
    "the relative velocity profile is also exponential - like for @xmath67 ( see figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) but displays a bagnold - like region of inverse concavity for @xmath68 ( see figure [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the numerical solution can be fitted by the analytical expression @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 the total flux flowing down the heap is @xmath72 the dependence on @xmath8 of @xmath73 and @xmath54 are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .      the flows over inclined rough plates are more difficult to handle because the constitutive equations ( [ tzz ] ) and ( [ txz ] ) hold only in the bulk of the dense granular medium and are likely to be modified close to the rough plate .",
    "since the role of the plate rugosity is difficult to assess quantitatively , we discard the description of the `` basal layer '' close to the plate @xcite and assume a slip velocity @xmath76 at some distance @xmath77 above the rough plate",
    ". then we apply ( [ tzz ] ) and ( [ txz ] ) to a layer of thickness @xmath78 , so that the free surface is located at a distance @xmath79 above the rough incline . in the slab of thickness @xmath78 ,",
    "the solid fraction increases from @xmath80 at the free surface to the value @xmath81 at a distance @xmath77 from the rough plate where the velocity is @xmath76 .",
    "the total flux through the core region is now given by : @xmath82 a rough plate is likely to slow down the core region more efficiently than a heap would do and we expect @xmath83 . as a consequence , @xmath84 as given in ( [ qplate ] )",
    "is not expected to exceed @xmath85 given in ( [ qheap ] ) .",
    "when forcing a flux @xmath86 to flow down a rough plane inclined at angle @xmath8 , two different situations are encountered : when @xmath87 is larger than @xmath88 , the granular medium will rearrange so as to flow down over a heap of angle @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "this gives a possible explanation for the `` immature sliding flows '' that were observed in some experiments @xcite . due to the very large increase of @xmath54 with @xmath8 ( see figure ( [ fig : fig4 ] ) ) and because the experimental flux is limited to some maximal value , immature sliding flows were observed for small angles close to @xmath91 only .",
    "conversely , when @xmath86 is smaller than @xmath85 the whole layer of thickness @xmath78 is in motion with a velocity everywhere larger than @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , when @xmath92 , the bagnold - like velocity profile ( which could hardly be observed in heap flows , see fig .",
    "( [ fig : fig3 ] ) ) is now invading the whole core region .",
    "in fact , when expressions ( [ eq : fmut ] ) are taken for granted and @xmath93 , the total flux ( [ qplate ] ) has the special form @xmath94 when the role of the velocity slip can be neglected , the second contribution gives the @xmath95 scaling which seems to be corroborated by experiments @xcite , as well as numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "in the two - dimensional shear flows we will consider the pressure load exerted on the boundaries of the granular medium is supposed to be applied along direction @xmath13 , which is thus the direction of main compression .",
    "because gravity plays a minor role concerning the compressive forces , the constitutive relation for @xmath18 is simply ( compare with ( [ tzz ] ) ) @xmath96 whatever the angle @xmath8 between the @xmath13 axis and gravity .",

    "we will distinguish the situation without and with gravity , the first case corresponding to numerical simulations and the second one to experiments .      in this case",
    "the normal stress is also a constant @xmath103 all over the granular layer and the constitutive equations ( [ tzzbis ] ) and ( [ txz ] ) give : @xmath104 depending on the sign of @xmath105 , we will have a static or a moving medium . in the static case",

    "it is clear that @xmath126 results in @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the compaction of the moving medium is thus reduced at the upper plate as compared to its static value while it is enhanced at the lower plate .",
    "the velocity profile is then deduced from the compaction profile @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the dimensionless shear @xmath131 .",

    "fig ( [ fig : fig6 ] ) shows the compaction and velocity profiles for two different values of @xmath142 investigating the two different situations depending whether localization occurs or not .",
    "a second type of confined shear flow is the chute between two vertical plates ( see figure [ fig : fig7 ] ) .",
    "the compaction is due to a pressure load @xmath103 exerted on the two plates along direction @xmath13 .",
    "the flow and the gravity are oriented along direction @xmath9 .",

    "the computed relative velocity field is represented in fig ( [ fig : fig8 ] ) together with the fit @xmath161",
    "neglecting the influence of gravity ( as was done in most numerical simulations ) our model leads to a uniform solid fraction and to a uniform velocity gradient , in conformity with results presented in figures 5b and 5c of @xcite for the dense flow regime .",
    "when gravity is taken into account , a shear localization is possible , depending on the magnitude of the pressure load as well as on the thickness of the granular layer .",
    "unfortunately , we are unaware of experimental or numerical data with which the predictions of fig .",
