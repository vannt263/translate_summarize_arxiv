    "many ideas about the nature of @xmath0-ray bursts have been discussed during last 25 years after their discovery ( for a review , see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . among these ideas",
    ", there was a suggestion that the sources of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) are at cosmological distances , i.e. at a redshift @xmath10 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "after the batse data became available ( @xcite , 1994 ) , the idea of a cosmological origin of grb sources has come to be taken very seriously ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent detections of absorption and emission features at a redshift @xmath11 in the optical afterglow of grb 970508 ( @xcite ) and at redshift @xmath12 in the host galaxy of grb 971214 ( @xcite ) clearly demonstrate that at least some of the grb sources lie at cosmological distances .",
    "a common feature of all acceptable models of cosmological @xmath0-ray bursters is that a relativistic wind is a source of grb radiation .",
    "the lorentz factor , @xmath5 , of such a wind is about @xmath13 or even more ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a very strong magnetic field may be in the plasma outflowing from cosmological @xmath0-ray bursters ( @xcite , 1994a , b ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it was pointed out ( @xcite , 1993 ; @xcite ) that the kinetic energy of relativistic winds may be converted into non - thermal radiation of grbs when these winds interact with an ambient medium ( e.g. , an ordinary interstellar medium or plasma which is ejected from the predecessor of the burster ) .",
    "recently , the interaction between a relativistic magnetized wind and an ambient medium was studied numerically ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and it was shown that electrons of the ambient medium which are reflected from the wind front are accelerated up to the mean energy of reflected protons . in this paper",
    "we study both the spectrum of electrons accelerated at the wind front and their non - thermal radiation .    a plausible model of cosmological grbs",
    "is discussed in   2 .",
    "the main results of our numerical simulations of the interaction between a relativistic strongly magnetized wind and an ambient medium are presented in   3 . the spectrum of electrons which are accelerated at the wind front and their non - thermal radiation are considered in ",
    "4 . finally , our main conclusions are summarized and discussed in   5 .",
    "the energy output of cosmological @xmath0-ray bursters in @xmath0-rays typically is @xmath14 ergs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and may be as high as @xmath15 ergs ( @xcite ) or even more ( @xcite ) .",
    "these estimates assume isotropic emission of grbs .",
    "such a high energetics of cosmological @xmath0-ray bursters and a short time scale of @xmath0-ray flux variability call for very compact objects as sources of grbs ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these objects may be either millisecond pulsars which are arisen from accretion - induced collapse of white dwarfs in close binaries ( @xcite ) or differentially rotating disk - like objects which are formed by the merger of a binary consisting of two neutron stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such very young fast - rotating compact objects have two possible sources of energy which may be responsible for radiation of cosmological grbs .",
    "these are the thermal energy of the compact objects and the kinetic energy of their rotation .",
    "the thermal energy may be transformed into @xmath0-rays by means of the following sequence of processes ( for review , see @xcite ) : ( 1 ) emission of neutrinos and cooling of the object ; ( 2 ) absorption of neutrinos @xmath16 and formation of a fireball which mainly consists of electrons and positrons ; ( 3 ) expansion of the fireball and formation of a relativistic shell , @xmath17 ; ( 4 ) interaction of the shell with an external medium and acceleration of electrons to very high energies ; and ( 5 ) generation of @xmath0-rays by high - energy electrons . the maximum thermal energy , @xmath18 , of very young compact objects is high enough to explain the energy output of cosmological gbbs , @xmath19 a few @xmath20 ergs .",
    "however , the fraction of the thermal energy that is converted into the energy of the electron - positron fireball and then into the kinetic energy of the relativistic shell is very small and can not be essentially more than @xmath21 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , the efficiency of transformation of the kinetic energy of a relativistic shell into radiation can not be more than @xmath22% ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , neutrino powered winds outflowing from compact objects may be responsible for the radiation of cosmological grbs only if they are well collimated , with opening angle about a few degrees or even less . for both young neutron stars and post - merger objects ,",
    "such a collimation of neutrino powered winds is very questionable ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .    the rotational energy of the compact objects at the moment of their formation may be comparable with the thermal energy , @xmath23",
    ". the efficiency of transformation of the rotational energy to the energy of a relativistic strongly magnetized wind and then to the energy of high - frequency radiation may be as high as almost 100% ( see usov 1994a , b ; blackman et al .",
    "1996 and below ) .",
    "for some time the theoretical expectation has been that rotation powered neutron stars ( pulsars ) should generate collimated outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the crab , vela , psr b1509 - 58 and possible psr b1951 + 32 all show evidence that this is indeed the case ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if the energy flux from the source of grb 990123 in the direction to the earth is only about ten times more than the energy flux averaged over all directions , the model of grbs based on the rotation powered winds can easily explain the energetics of such an extremal event as grb 990123 ( @xcite ) .",
    "such an anisotropy of emission from the burst sources does nt contradict available data on grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of typical grbs with the energy output of @xmath14 ergs",
    ", this model can explain their energetics even if the emission of grbs is nearly isotropic .",
    "therefore , the rotational energy of compact objects is a plausible source of energy for cosmological grbs , not the thermal energy .    in many papers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; blackman et al . 1996 ; @xcite ) , it was argued that the strength of the magnetic field @xmath24 at the surface of compact objects may be as high as @xmath25 g or even more .",
    "such a strong magnetic field leads to both deceleration of the rotation of the fast - rotating compact object on a time scale of seconds and generation of a strongly magnetized wind that flows away from the object at a relativistic speed , @xmath26 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the outflowing wind is poynting flux  dominated , i.e. , @xmath27 , where    @xmath28    is the luminosity of the compact object in the poynting flux , @xmath29 is its luminosity in both electron - positron pairs and radiation , @xmath30 is the speed of light , @xmath31 is the radius of the compact object and @xmath32 is its angular velocity ; @xmath33  cm and @xmath34  s@xmath35 for both millisecond pulsars and post - merger objects . for compact objects with extremely strong magnetic fields , @xmath36  g , it is expected that @xmath37 is @xmath38 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a plausible magnetic topology for a relativistic magnetized wind outflowing from an oblique rotator ( @xmath39 ) with a nearly dipole magnetic field is shown in figure  1 , where @xmath40 is the angle between the rotational axis and the magnetic axis .",
    "near the rotational poles , the wind field should be helical ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is because the magnetic flux originates in a single polar cap .",
    "near the rotational equator , the toroidal magnetic field of the wind should be striped and alternates in polarity on a scalelength of @xmath41  cm .",
    "these magnetic stripes are separated by thin current sheets @xmath42 . off the equator ,",
    "the magnetic flux in the toward and away stripes is unequal if @xmath43 . in other words , in the striped region ,",
    "the wind field is a superposition of a pure helical field and a pure striped field with nearly equal magnetic fluxes in adjacent stripes .",
    "since the luminosity of a @xmath0-ray burster in a relativistic magnetized wind drops in time , @xmath44 , the wind structure at the moment @xmath45 is similar to a shell with the radius @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a numerical index , @xmath48 , and @xmath49  s is the characteristic time of deceleration of the compact object rotation due to the action of the electromagnetic torque and the torque related to generation of gravitational radiation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the thickness of the shell is @xmath50 .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field at the front of the wind is about    @xmath51    where @xmath52s@xmath53  cm is the radius of the light cylinder .",
    "non - thermal radiation from a relativistic strongly magnetized wind depends on whether the wind is striped in the direction of its outflow or not .",
    "if the wind is striped ( see fig.1 ) , the magnetic field is more or less frozen in the outflowing plasma at the distance @xmath54 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , where    @xmath55    at @xmath56 , the wind density is not sufficient to screen displacement currents , and the striped component of the wind field is transformed into large - amplitude electromagnetic waves ( laemws ) due to development of magneto - parametric instability ( @xcite , 1994a , b ; blackman et al .",
    "1996 ; @xcite ) .",
    "[ for a criterion for electromagnetic waves to be considered as laemws see   4 .",
    "] the typical frequency of generated laemws is equal to @xmath32 , and their amplitude is @xmath57 .",
    "outflowing particles are accelerated in the field of laemws to lorentz factors of the order of @xmath58 , and generate non - thermal synchro  compton radiation with the typical energy of photons in the range of a few @xmath59  mev ( usov 1994a , b ; blackman et al . 1996 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a long high - energy tail of the @xmath0-ray spectrum may exist up to @xmath60  mev .",
    "this is consistent with the observed spectra of grbs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the radiative damping length for laemws generated at @xmath61 is a few orders of magnitude less than @xmath62 ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , at @xmath63 laemws decay almost completely , and their energy is transferred to high - energy electrons and then to x - ray and @xmath0-ray photons .",
    "it is worth noting that when the magnetic axis is perpendicular to the rotational axis , @xmath64 , the electromagnetic field of the poynting flux ",
    "dominated wind is purely striped just as vacuum magnetic dipole waves ( @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", almost all energy of the wind is radiated in x - rays and @xmath0-rays at @xmath61 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the total energy output in hard photons per a grb may be as high as @xmath65 a few @xmath20 ergs .    at @xmath63 and @xmath66 ,",
    "the magnetic field is helical everywhere in the outflowing wind ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "such a relativistic strongly magnetized wind expands more or less freely up to the distance    @xmath67    at which deceleration of the wind due to its interaction with an ambient medium becomes important ( @xcite ) , where @xmath68 is the density of the ambient medium and @xmath69 is the kinetic energy of the outflowing wind , @xmath70 .",
    "substituting @xmath71 for @xmath72 into equation ( [ bobj ] ) , we have the following estimate for the magnetic field at the wind front at @xmath73 :    @xmath74    for typical parameters of cosmological @xmath0-ray bursters , @xmath75  g , @xmath76  s@xmath35 , @xmath77  ergs and @xmath26 , if the ambient medium is an ordinary interstellar gas , @xmath78  cm @xmath79 , from equation ( [ bdec ] ) we have @xmath80  g.    it is suggested by mszros and rees ( 1992 ) that in the process of the wind  ambient medium interaction at @xmath81 , an essential part of the wind energy may be transferred to high - energy electrons and then to high - frequency ( x - ray and @xmath0-ray ) emission . this suggestion is confirmed by our numerical simulations ( see @xcite ; @xcite and below ) .",
    "hence , in our scenario in a general case , when the rotational axis and the magnetic axis are not aligned @xmath82 or perpendicular @xmath83 , there are at least two regions where powerful non - thermal x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission of grbs may be generated .",
    "the first region is at @xmath84  cm , and the second one is at @xmath85  cm .",
    "acceleration of electrons and their radiation in the first radiating region at @xmath61 were considered in details earlier ( usov 1994a , b ; blackman et al .",
    "1996 ; blackman & yi 1998 ) .",
    "below , we consider the spectrum of electrons accelerated at @xmath86 and their radiation .",
    "for consideration of the interaction between a relativistic magnetized wind and an ambient medium , it is convenient to switch to the co - moving frame of the outflowing plasma ( the wind frame ) . while changing the frame , the magnetic and electric fields in the wind are reduced from @xmath87 and @xmath88^{1/2 } \\simeq b$ ] in the frame of the @xmath0-ray burster to @xmath89 and @xmath90 in the wind frame . using this and equation ( [ bdec ] ) , for typical parameters of cosmological @xmath0-ray bursters",

    "the problem of the wind  ambient medium interaction is identical to the problem of collision between a wide relativistic beam of cold plasma and a region with a strong magnetic field which is called a magnetic barrier .",
    "recently , the interaction of a wide relativistic plasma beam with a magnetic barrier was studied numerically ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in these studies , the following initial condition of the beam  barrier system was assumed . initially , at @xmath93 , the ultrarelativistic homogeneous neutral beam of protons and electrons ( number densities @xmath94 ) runs along the @xmath95 axis and impacts at the barrier , where @xmath96 is constant .",

    "\\(1 ) two collisionless shocks form : an external shock that propagates from the wind front into the ambient medium , and an internal shock that propagates from the wind front into the inner wind , with a contact discontinuity at the wind front between the shocked material .",
    "the idea about formation of two collisionless shocks near the front of a relativistic wind outflowing from a cosmological @xmath0-ray burster is based mainly on both theoretical studies which have shown that collisionless shocks can form in a rarified plasma ( e.g. , sagdeev 1962 , 1979 ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) and the fact that such shocks have been observed in the vicinities of a few comets and planets ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "undoubtedly , collisionless shocks exist and can accelerate electrons to ultrarelativistic energies in many astrophysical objects such as supernova remnants and jets of active galactic nuclei .",
    "however , for the wind parameters which are relevant to cosmological grbs ( see   2 ) , formation of collisionless shocks in the vicinity of the wind front is very questionable ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . indeed ,",

    "a collisionless shock may form only if the characteristic size of the system is significantly larger than the shock thickness . in our case , the radius , @xmath72 , of the wind front is the characteristic size of the system . at @xmath86 ,",

    "an external collisionless shock can not form ahead of the wind front , especially if @xmath5 is about @xmath288 or even more . recently , brainerd ( 1999 ) came to the same conclusion from another consideration . as to the internal shock , it can not form in a poynting flux - dominated wind too ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our model of the wind  ambient medium interaction differs qualitatively from the conventional model which is based on the assumption that an external collisionless shock forms just ahead of the wind front .",
    "although it might seem that observational consequences of our model must differ from observational consequences of the conventional model significantly , this is not the case .",

    "therefore , if in the conventional model of grb emission from the shocked region ahead of the wind front the mechanism of electron acceleration by a relativistic , collisionless shock is replaced by the mechanism of electron acceleration at the wind front , this model will remain otherwise practically unchanged .    at @xmath289 ,",
    "the outflowing wind slows down due to its interaction with the ambient medium , and when the lorentz factor of the wind front is about several tens or less , an external shock may form just ahead of the front .",
