    "spectroscopy of positronium ( ps ) provides a sensitive test of bound state theory based on the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "because of the small mass of electron and positron , the effects of strong and weak interactions are negligible compared with the accuracy of present experiments .",
    "for this reason positronium represents a unique system which can , in principle , be described with very high precision by means of the qed only .",
    "tests of the qed predictions are made possible by the very high experimental accuracy of positronium spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the gross spectrum of positronium is well described by the schrdinger equation with the coulomb potential .",
    "energy levels are @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the principal quantum number . for the purpose of interpreting modern experiments the precision of eq .",
    "( [ elo ] ) is insufficient .",
    "corrections to the energy levels can in part be described by the quantum mechanics ; however , for a complete description one has to resort to the quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "unfortunately , an application of the qft to the bound states is difficult and special methods have to be devised @xcite .",
    "various approaches to bound state calculations have been reviewed e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "here we focus on a method close to the so  called non - relativistic quantum electrodynamics ( nrqed ) @xcite , which is an effective field theory based on the qed , for small energies and momenta .",
    "( [ elo ] ) implies that the characteristic velocity of the electron and positron in positronium is of the order of the fine structure constant @xmath5 .",
    "it is appropriate to apply a non - relativistic approximation to this system .",
    "recently much progress has been achieved in the framework of non - relativistic effective theories , mainly by employing dimensional regularization .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this regularization procedure permits an exact separation of effects arising at various characteristic energy scales . using that method , which we will call dimensionally regularized nrqed ( nrqed@xmath6 ) the complete energy spectrum of ps has been reproduced to order @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have computed @xmath8 corrections to the hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) of the ps ground state @xcite , confirming one of previously obtained numerical results @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we generalize that result to all @xmath2 states , confirming @xcite , and compute also their spin independent shift at @xmath0 ( obtained numerically in @xcite ) .",
    "it is convenient to describe the energy of an @xmath1 state of ps by dividing it up into the spin  averaged part and a part dependent on the total ps spin ( hyperfine splitting ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total spin value of the ps and @xmath11 are the spins of the electron and positron , respectively .",
    "one finds : @xmath12 both the spin  averaged energy and the hyperfine splitting can be represented by series in powers and logarithms of the fine structure constant . in the lowest order @xmath13",
    "is given by eq .",
    "( [ elo ] ) , and @xmath14 .    to order @xmath7",
    "the results for @xmath15 and @xmath16 were found in @xcite .",
    "those corrections have several sources : electron and positron charge radii and anomalous magnetic moments , vacuum polarization , two - photon exchange , two - photon annihilation and one - loop correction to the single - photon annihilation .",
    "current accuracy of high precision experiments requires a complete calculation of the @xmath0 corrections @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the most precisely measured property of positronium is the ground state hfs , i.e.  the energy difference between the two lowest states with total spin @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "two best experimental values are @xmath21 found in @xcite and @xmath22 obtained in @xcite .",
    "another quantity of the experimental interest is the energy difference of @xmath23 and @xmath24 states",
    "@xcite : @xmath25 the absolute accuracy of this measurement is clearly less impressive than that of the hyperfine splitting .",
    "however , since @xmath26 , a complete calculation of the energy levels at this order is warranted .    at order @xmath8 both @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be written as @xmath27 the logarithmic contributions at this order , @xmath28 , present in the annihilation @xmath29 and recoil @xmath30 corrections , were found first @xcite .",
    "@xmath31 arises from the radiative corrections to the breit potential at @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the three , two , and one - photon annihilation contributions giving @xmath29 were found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the non - annihilation radiative recoil contributions @xmath33 were calculated in @xcite , while pure recoil corrections @xmath30 were obtained in @xcite for the hfs and in @xcite for @xmath15 .",
    "in this paper we present an analytic calculation of the recoil and radiative recoil corrections , @xmath31 and @xmath34 , to energy levels of arbitrary @xmath1 positronium states .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : frame ] we discuss our method in general terms .",
    "section [ sec : hfs ] is devoted to the calculation of the hfs .",
    "many technical details of this calculation are discussed there . in section [ sec : lev ] we present a calculation of the average energy @xmath35 .",
    "it is very similar to hfs , except that some additional operators contribute .",
    "also the @xmath0 radiative recoil corrections are discussed .",
    "our results are summarized in section [ sec : sum ] , where also an overview of the theoretical and experimental situation is given and a complete analytic formula for the @xmath1 energy levels to order @xmath8 is presented .",
    "before getting into details , let us describe the general framework of our calculation of the @xmath0 corrections to energy levels .",
    "first , we calculate an on  shell scattering amplitude for non - relativistic @xmath36 particles to the needed order ( the fact that @xmath37 in ps serves as a counting rule for contributions of various operators ) .",
    "in addition to the leading , single coulomb exchange , this includes the relative @xmath38 breit corrections and also higher order @xmath39 terms .",
    "this non - relativistic amplitude is gauge invariant , and taken with a minus sign provides the potential for non  relativistic particles .",
    "next , we use the ordinary quantum mechanical perturbation theory to find the corrections due to that potential ; as unperturbed states we use the solutions of the schrdinger equation with the coulomb potential .",
    "we get the @xmath0 correction to energy levels as the sum of the first order correction due to @xmath40 perturbation and of the second order correction due to the breit hamiltonian .",
    "previously , this scheme was used for the calculation of the @xmath41 corrections to the levels of @xmath2-states @xcite and of the @xmath42 corrections to the levels of @xmath43-states @xcite .    in the present calculation the result of the non - relativistic calculation is divergent .",
    "this is because also the short - distance ( `` hard '' ) corrections contribute .",
    "they arise from virtual momenta regions of the order of electron mass and can not be obtained from the non  relativistic expansion .",
    "our calculation is performed in the spirit of nrqed .",
    "we apply dimensional regularization , which offers technical advantages over more common techniques , based on the introduction of an intermediate cut - off to separate the relativistic and non  relativistic momentum regions .",
    "dimensional regularization makes the matching of the low - scale effective theory and the complete qed extremely simple .",
    "we find that in the sum of the short and long  distance contributions the singularities in the parameter and @xmath44 . ]",
    "@xmath45 disappear and one arrives at a finite result .    the spinor algebra in dimensional regularization requires some comments .",
    "in order to obtain the energy shift due to an operator @xmath46 one has to calculate the trace of the form @xmath47 $ ] , where @xmath48 is an appropriate wave function .",
    "the spinor parts of the relevant wave functions are @xmath49 for para and orthopositronium states , respectively . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath50 is the polarization vector ( we average over its directions ) .",
    "the traces are calculated in a standard way in the @xmath51-dimensional space .",
    "one encounters only even numbers of @xmath52 matrices , and we treat them as anticommuting .",
    "since the matrix elements involve the positronium wave function , it is easiest to calculate for the ground state ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "however , once the corrections to the ground state have been found , there is a convenient way of finding them for excited states , with an arbitrary value of the principal quantum number @xmath4 .",
    "only the non - relativistic contributions have a non - trivial dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "their computation in dimensional regularization would be difficult . however , this task is simplified using other regularizations .",
    "finally , we eliminate the cut - off dependence by requiring that for @xmath53 the result matches the formula we found for @xmath53 .",
    "the freedom of choosing the regularization scheme simplifies considerably this part of the calculation .",
    "in this section we present a calculation of the recoil corrections to the ps ground state , @xmath54 .",
    "it is given as a sum of soft ( non - relativistic ) eq .  ( [ hfsnonrel ] ) and hard eq .",
    "( [ hard ] ) scales : @xmath55 those two groups of contributions are computed , respectively , in sections [ sec : soft ] and [ sec : hard ] .",
    "further , in section [ sec : nhfs ] , we find a generalization of this result for radially excited states ( arbitrary @xmath4 ) : @xmath56 , \\label{ehfsrecn}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the logarithmic derivative of the @xmath58-function and @xmath59 is the euler constant .",
    "the @xmath4 dependence of this result and its numerical value at @xmath53 are in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we divide up the non - relativistic contributions to hfs into 6 parts : tree level coulomb and magnetic photon exchanges , retardation , one - loop operators , and second iteration of breit hamiltonian which includes intermediate s and d wave states : @xmath60 these partial results , given in eqs .",

    "we identify the on  shell scattering amplitude , taken with the minus sign , with the matrix element of an interaction operator in the momentum representation .",
    "the soft scale contributions are calculated using the time - independent `` old - fashioned '' perturbation theory and the coulomb gauge .",
    "since this technique is not very common , let us recall its basic ingredients .",
    "exchange of a coulomb or magnetic photon is described , respectively , by @xmath62 or @xmath63 . in the latter case ,",
    "the denominator @xmath64 arises from the magnetic photon s phase space element .",
