    "the recovery of old solar observations lets one to extend time series of various solar parameters into the past , including solar diameter , sunspot number , sunspot areas , and even sunspot positions .",
    "sets of observations made during the same time period allow gaps to be filled , and provide either confirmation or reasonable doubt of the reliability ot those data .",
    "in addition , with these historical data , one can see how these parameters change with time ( @xcite ) .",
    "the telescopic observation of the sun began in 1610 with the records of the english astronomer thomas harriot , who was followed by other pioneers . in the following decades and centuries , until the digital era , large amounts of solar data was collected , and is now preserved in libraries and archives .",
    "this data is gradually been recovered , digitalized , and analysed with current technology ( @xcite ) . in the last few years , for instance",
    ", several software packages have been developed to analyse sunspot drawings .",
    "examples are hsunspots ( @xcite ) , digisun ( @xcite ) , and cams ( @xcite ) .    scans of the solar disk drawings made by the early solar observers in the first half of the 17th century , thomas harriot ( @xcite ) , galileo galilei ( @xcite ) , christopher scheiner ( scheiner , 1630 ) , and johannes hevelius ( @xcite ) , have allowed the sunspots heliographic positions to be determined and , from them , the rotation velocities of the groups ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for the second half of the 17th century , during the maunder minimum ( 16451715 ) , a period of low solar activity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , just some isolated observations have been located with which to estimate the rotation velocities of the sunspot groups .",
    "two examples are the cases of nicholas bion in 1672 ( @xcite ) and john flamsteed in 1684 ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a long series recorded by observers at the paris observatory which was recovered and analysed by @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sunspot drawings made by johann staudach in the period 17491799 were used by @xcite ( @xcite ) to determine the solar differential rotation in the second half of the 18th century .",
    "there is only very sparse information about the solar rotation during the first half of the 19th century , especially during the dalton minimum ( 18001825 ) .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) presented an estimate of solar rotation rate in the period 18471849 using the sunspot positions recorded by w. c. bond at the harvard college observatory .",
    "moreover , @xcite ( @xcite ) presented an inventory of the log books of samuel heinrich schwabe , the discoverer of the solar cycle , and an evaluation of the solar drawings contained in this source from 18251867 .",
    "recently , @xcite ( @xcite ) reported the heliographic coordinates determined from those solar drawings .    in the second half of the 19th century ,",
    "long solar observation campaigns were conducted by richard c. carrington ( carrington , 1863 ) , gustav sprer ( @xcite ) , christian f. h. peters ( @xcite ) , warren de la rue ( @xcite and @xcite ) , and the greenwich observatory ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , ( @xcite ) reconstructed the sunspots characteristics using the data of carrington and sprer .",
    "recently , @xcite ( @xcite ) ( cv14 hereafter ) have described the conversion to machine readable format of the large tables of sunspot positions observed by carrington , peters and de la rue , making a first analysis of the datasets .",
    "we have now determined the rotational speed of the sun using the different sunspots as tracers to exploit this old data and we have established a differential rotation law for each observational dataset .",
    "our interest in this analysis was twofold .",
    "first , we wanted to check the evolution of the differential rotation law over short times .",
    "and second , we used the sunspot area data published by de la rue to search for a correlation with the rotation velocity of the sunspot groups .",
    "cv14 have provided an electronic version of the sunspot position catalogues made by carrington , peters , and de la rue , taking into consideration the different coordinate systems that were used .",
    "carrington and de la rue used normalized polar coordinates @xmath0 and the `` carrington '' heliographic coordinates for each observation .",
    "this allowed a cross check to be made between them , revealing some typographical errors in the original papers ( see cv14 for details ) .",
    "a calculation mistake was found in the data published by @xcite ( @xcite ) because the @xmath1 correction was not used in the published original data .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) represented the sunspot positions in celestial cartesian coordinates @xmath2 and in the  peter ",
    "heliographic coordinates . in the same paper ( @xcite )",
    ", a table compiled by mr philip fox helps to transform the ",
    "peters  coordinates to the  carrington  coordinates .",
    "this again allowed us to do a cross check of the data and to correct some typographical errors .",
    "a consistent dataset is required for all the data to be analysed .",
    "for this reason , we used the file * comdata.dat * introduced in our previous paper ( cv14 ) . in this file ,",
    "the sunspot positions are given referred to the carrington heliographic coordinates calculated from the polar and cartesian coordinates listed by the three historical sources , and using the sun s physical ephemeris provided on the _ horizons _ web page ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use quotes in the name of the original carrington coordinates because we found a systematic difference between them and the coordinates that we calculated .",
    "we do not know the origin of this difference , but believe it to be related to the ephemeris ( see details in cv14 ) .",
    "carrington and de la rue identified the sunspot groups with a sequential number , trying to relate their observations on different days .",
    "but there are some incongruences in the data . for",
    "this reason we created an algorithm to cross - correlate the different observations .",
    "we named this algorithm `` friends , and friends of friends '' ( f&fof ) .",
    "the basic idea is that observation @xmath3 is a `` friend '' of observation @xmath4 if the time between them is less than 14 days , the absolute difference between their carrington heliographic longitudes is less than 5 degrees , and the absolute difference between their heliographic latitudes is less than 2 degrees .",
    "the second rule is that if observation @xmath3 is a `` friend '' of @xmath4 , and @xmath4 is a `` friend '' of @xmath5 , then observation @xmath3 is a `` friend '' of @xmath5 too .    with this simple algorithm we found 486 different sunspots , each with strictly more than two observations for carrington , 1071 for peters , and 470 for de la rue .",
    "carrington and peters observed simultaneously from 23 may 1860 to 24 march 1861 , and de la rue s entire campaign lies within peters observation run .",
    "using the same rules as the f&fof algorithm , we cross - correlated the sunspots observed by each astronomer , finding 104 coincident groups between carrington ( 21.4% of his total amount ) and peters ( 9.7% ) , and 157 between de la rue ( 33.4% ) and peters ( 14.6% ) .",
    "table [ diferenciesobs ] lists the differences in the heliographic coordinates between the values measured by each pair of observers .",
    "this table uses the median and the standard deviation associated with the median absolute deviation @xmath6 to avoid the outliers . for both pairs of observers ,",
    "the differences between their heliographic longitude and latitude measurements were less than @xmath7 in absolute value , allowing one to conclude that the coordinates obtained are compatible .",
    ".comparison between the heliographic coordinates observed simultaneously by carrington and peters , and by de la rue and peters .",
    "the value of @xmath8 used is the median of the differences in the observations in the sense carrington / de la rue minus peters to avoid outliers , and the associated error is the standard deviation related to the mad ( see the text for the definition ) . [",

    "table ii of @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite ) lists the penumbral , umbral , and total areas measured for each sunspot group .",
    "those data are probably the first published values of these quantities .",
    "note that @xcite ( @xcite ) determined average values of the sunspot group penumbral - to - umbral area ratio from these early observations by de la rue from the years 1862 to 1866 that were similar to the values reported by hathaway ( 2013 ) for the period 18741976 using the sunspot catalogue of the royal observatory , greenwich .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) and @xcite ( @xcite ) studied the relationship between the rotational velocity of a sunspot group and its maximum area .",
    "we analysed this correlation in the data of @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we did not consider the absolute rotational velocity because of its dependence on the heliographic latitude .",
    "instead , we considered the difference between the rotational velocity evaluated for each sunspot group and the differential velocity calculated using the coefficients given in table [ omega_diff ] . to this end",
    ", we took a logarithmic scale for the areas and split them into twelve equal width bins on that scale , and then averaged the velocities in each of those bins .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ area_v ] .",
    "one observes in the figure that the differences do not depend on the area , the mean value being @xmath9degrees / day .",
    "solar rotation is an important parameter in trying to understand our sun .",
    "there is little information available on solar rotation in the 19th century , however .",
    "we have tried to contribute to improving this situation by studying the sunspot catalogues published by carrington , peters , and de la rue in that century , covering the period 18531870 .",
    "we have determined the rotational velocity for each sunspot group identified in those catalogues . from our findings",
    ", we would highlight three results :      \\(ii ) fitting a differential rotation law @xmath10 , we found no differences between peters and de la rue s observations .",
    "there was , however , a slightly lower value for @xmath11 , the rotational velocity at the equator , for carrington s observations .",
    "there were no differences between the values of @xmath12 , the coefficient of the term that depends on the latitude , considering the error bars .",
    "this work was made possible by the recovery of three sunspot catalogues published in the 19th century .",
    "the study and merging of historical sunspot catalogues should contribute to our better understanding the state of the sun in the last two centuries at least ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
