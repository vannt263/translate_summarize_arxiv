    "the wave - particle duality is a striking manifestation of bohr s principle of complementarity @xcite which lies at the heart of quantum mechanics . in 1979 ,",
    "wootters and zurek @xcite first _ quantified _ the wave - particle duality in an einstein s version of the double - slit experiment .",
    "later , two kinds of _ duality inequalities _ were established in the standard mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) setup .",
    "the first one @xcite , @xmath0 is about the trade - off between the _ predictability _ @xmath1 of two possible paths taken by a particle passing through the interferometer and the _ a priori _ fringe visibility @xmath2 of the interference pattern emerging at one output port of the interferometer .",
    "this can be tested when the probabilities of taking the two paths are not equal so that @xmath3 .",
    "the second one @xcite , e.g. , @xmath4is about the trade - off between the _ distinguishability _ @xmath5 of the paths and the fringe visibility @xmath6 when each particle is coupled to another physical system which serves as a which - path detector ( wpd )",
    ".    another celebrated quintessential feature of quantum mechanics is that there exist incompatible observables , i.e. , observables which can not be jointly measured in a single device .",
    "however , in some cases , two incompatible sharp observables could still be jointly measured on condition that some imprecision is allowed .",
    "exactly speaking , the unsharp versions of these observables could be marginals of a bivariate joint observable , so that measuring the joint observable offers simultaneously the values of the two unsharp observables @xcite .",
    "the so - called joint measurability problem  given two unsharp observables , are they jointly measurable ? was first brought forward by busch @xcite who solved it in a very special case .",
    "though there have been many partial results concerning this problem in the past few years busch2,ueda1,ueda2,busch3,stano1,us , the necessary and sufficient condition for joint measurability of two general unsharp observables of a two - level system was derived only recently by three independent groups stano2,jm , busch4 .",
    "the problem of joint measurability has also been studied from other aspects , including the uncertainty relation @xcite , quantum cloning @xcite , and bell inequalities @xcite , and so on .",
    "recently , we have brought to light an intimate relationship between joint measurability of two unsharp qubit observables and the wave - particle duality illustrated in the standard mzi @xcite .",
    "in fact , the measurement made on the wpd provides us the which - path information , or the likelihood for guessing the right path  @xmath7 and meanwhile the counting detections at the output ports of the interferometer yield the interference pattern .",
    "since these two measurements are made on different systems and therefore can be made simultaneously , the whole setup provides _ de facto _ a joint measurement of two unsharp observables of the particle . due to the fact that the beam splitters in the standard mzi are _ symmetric _",
    ", i.e. , the proportion of the transmissivity and the reflectivity of each beam splitter is @xmath8 , the two unsharp observables turn out to be _",
    "orthogonal_. the condition for their joint measurability leads exactly to the duality inequality eq .",
    "( [ di ] ) .",
    "as well as we know , all duality inequalities so far have been derived in the standard mzi setup with symmetric beam splitters . in the present work we shall consider the wave - particle duality in a _",
    "general _ mzi setup with _ asymmetric _ beam splitters .",
    "when equipped with a wpd , this general mzi setup provides a simultaneous measurement of two _ non - orthogonal _ unsharp observables .",
    "the condition for joint measurability of these two observables @xcite enables us to obtain a duality inequality . unlike the symmetric case , two different interferences between two paths among four paths appear at the two output ports in the asymmetric case , and the _",
    "a priori _ path information is different for a particle detected at one output port and a particle detected at the other , thus needing to be treated more meticulously .",
    "consider the two - path mzi setup as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "1 . for a particle passing through the interferometer ,",
    "the two distinct paths after the first beam splitter @xmath9 define two orthonormal states @xmath10 and @xmath11 which span a two - dimensional hilbert space . without loss of generosity we can take @xmath12 as symmetric since the initial state of the particle is taken to be arbitrary .",
    "the second beam splitter @xmath13 is taken to be asymmetric and we denote by @xmath14 its reflectivity , i.e. , the probability of the particle being reflected , and @xmath15 the transmissivity .",
    "the action of @xmath13 on the particle is effectively a unitary transformation@xmath16on the above - mentioned two - dimensional hilbert space .     and @xmath17 record two interference patterns .",
    "the interference pattern recorded by the detector @xmath18 ( the detector @xmath17 ) comes from path 1 and path 2 ( path 3 and path 4 ) . in addition , a wpd is introduced whose initial state is @xmath19 . after interacting with the particle via a controlled unitary transformation ,",
    "a special observable @xmath20 of the wpd is measured , from which the path information of the particle is inferred.,width=321 ]    to obtain simultaneously the which - path information and the interference pattern , a wpd with initial state @xmath21 is coupled to the particle and two phase shifts @xmath22 are introduced for the two paths @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the interaction between the particle and the wpd is effectively a controlled unitary transformation @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the identity and a unitary operator act on the hilbert space of the wpd .",
    "thus the evolution of the particle and the detector after @xmath9 is governed by the unitary operator @xmath27where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be the state of the particle after it has passed through @xmath9 .",
    "then the final state of the whole system is described by @xmath31 distinguishing two paths among four paths -----------------------------------------    first of all , we notice that the asymmetric beam splitter @xmath13 can be regarded as a kind of which - path detector .",
    "consider a simple case where the probabilities for the particle taking the two paths after @xmath9 are equal , i.e. , there is no _ a priori _ which - path knowledge .",
    "if the reflectivity @xmath14 of @xmath13 is larger than @xmath32 and the particle is detected at the detector @xmath18 , immediately one can infer that the particle passes more likely through the path @xmath33 .",
    "so the asymmetric beam splitter introduces additional _ a priori _ which - path knowledge and accordingly the visibility observed at the detector @xmath18 would be decreased . in a general case where the probabilities for taking the two paths after @xmath9 , namely @xmath34 and @xmath35 , are not equal ,",
    "the _ a priori _ which - path knowledge provided by @xmath13 is different for a particle detected at one output port of the interferometer and a particle detected at the other output port .",
    "accordingly , two different interference patterns emerge at the two output ports . hence , in order to explore which path the particle passes through and to observe the interference pattern simultaneously , at first one should concentrate on particles detected at one output port and then choose a strategy to extract the which - path information from the measurements made on the detector , taking into account the corresponding _ a priori _ which - path knowledge .",
    "specifically , the introduction of an asymmetric beam splitter entails the need to distinguish _ two paths among four paths , _ see fig . 1 .",
    "on the observation of an interference pattern , e.g. , at the detector @xmath18 , two possible paths taken by the particles contributing to the interference are labeled with 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "when there is no wpd , the probabilities of taking the two paths are @xmath36which provides the conditional _ a priori _ which - path knowledge provided that detector @xmath18 fires .",
    "similarly , for the particles detected by @xmath37 , the probabilities of taking path 3 and path 4 are @xmath38respectively .",
    "note that ( 1 ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 are equal to @xmath41 when @xmath13 is symmetric , and so to distinguish path 1 and path 2 ( path 3 and path 4 ) is equivalent to distinguish the paths @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "hence in a standard mzi scheme it is not necessary to involve four paths ; ( 2 ) when @xmath42 , the conditional _ a priori _ path information @xmath39 is the same as @xmath43 , but not equal to @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , in the experiment scheme in @xcite only two paths need to be distinguished and the difference between @xmath41 and @xmath39 @xmath44 is used to gain the which - path information . in other words ,",
    "the asymmetric beam splitter in the experiment plays also the role of a wpd so that the path information and the interference pattern are obtained via the same detector .",
    "thus the setup in @xcite can be regarded as a standard mzi .    in the scheme we considered here , the predictability @xmath1 , the _ a priori _ fringe visibility @xmath2 , the visibility @xmath45 , and the distinguishability @xmath5 must be defined particularly for each pair of paths . in what follows",
    "we shall consider only the interference pattern registered by detector @xmath18 , and the case for the detector @xmath17 is similar .",
    "in this case the predictability of the paths 1 and 2 is obviously@xmath46the two paths taken by the particle are conditioned on the clicks in detector @xmath18 , whose probability is given by @xmath47 = rw_{+}+tw_{- } \\\\ & & + 2\\sqrt{rt}\\left\\vert \\left\\langle 0\\right\\vert \\rho \\left\\vert 1\\right\\rangle \\text{\\textrm{tr}}_{d}(\\rho _",
    "{ d}u)\\right\\vert \\cos \\left ( \\phi + \\alpha + \\delta \\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath48 and @xmath49@xmath50 .",
    "if the wpd is not turned on , i.e , @xmath51 , then the _ a priori _ visibility reads @xmath52it is easy to see that the well - known duality relation @xcite@xmath53still holds in the present case . if the wpd is turned on , then the fringe visibility reads@xmath54    a general strategy @xmath55 to guess the path taken by the particle is to divide the outcomes @xmath20 of the measurement of an observable @xmath56 performed on the wpd into two disjoint sets , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . if @xmath59 , then one guesses the path to be 1 ; if @xmath60 , then one guesses the path to be 2 .",
    "the probability of guessing the right path is given by confluence @xmath61this is because once the particle is detected in path 1 ( with probability @xmath62 ) , the wpd will be in the state @xmath21 ; once the particle is detected in path 2 ( with probability @xmath63 ) , the wpd will be in the state @xmath64 .",
    "let us denote @xmath65together with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the which - path _ distinguishability _ for the given strategy @xmath55 is then@xmath68",
    "the duality relation in an interferometer turns out to be intimately related to the joint measurement of two unsharp observables @xcite .",
    "generally , for a two - level system an unsharp observable is nothing else than a two - outcome positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) .",
    "two general unsharp observables @xmath69 and @xmath70 of a qubit take the form@xmath71where @xmath72 is the identity operator acting on the particle , and @xmath73 is the pauli operator .",
    "the non - negativity imposes @xmath74 and so on . when @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 are projectors of eigenstates of a sharp observable @xmath78 .",
    "so , generally an unsharp observable is the smeared version of a sharp observable . the above two unsharp observables are jointly measurable if and only if there exists a joint unsharp observable @xmath79 whose outcomes can be so grouped that the marginals correspond exactly to the two given unsharp observables , i.e. , @xmath80if @xmath81 then the necessary and sufficient condition for their joint measurability reads @xcite @xmath82    in our general mzi setup , the unsharp observable @xmath83 corresponding to the interference pattern registered in detector @xmath18 is given by @xmath84@xmath85 for an arbitrary @xmath30 .",
