    "the hypernova explosions accompanying grbs are type i@xmath2 ; i.e. , they show no hydrogen lines and no helium lines .",
    "arguments have been given that the helium lines would not be seen even if the helium were present , that helium would have to mix with @xmath3ni if the lines were to be seen , etc .",
    "thus , hydrogen is not present at the time of the explosion .",
    "as we shall outline , this is the situation in common envelope evolution in case c mass transfer .",
    "case c mass transfer means mass transfer after the helium burning of the giant is finished .",
    "for such a case the grb and hypernova explosion for nova sco ( gro j1655@xmath040 ) was described by @xcite .",
    "we can now reconstruct the explosion for this case , since the kerr parameters ( @xmath4 ) of nova sco and il lupi have been measured in the smithsonian - harvard - mit observations @xcite , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "they check against the prediction of @xcite ( denoted as lbw ) who found @xmath7 for both . from the @xmath4 we can construct available energies in the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "we have a simple guiding principle for the sources considered ; namely , that the explosion energy depends chiefly on the mass of the donor ( secondary star ) , and this is easily seen if the binaries are evolved in case c mass transfer , as we shall show .    in similar vein",
    ", the grbs and hypernova explosions can be constructed for xte j1550@xmath0564 and gs 2023@xmath1338 ( v404 cygni ) , the available rotational energy being nearly the same as in nova sco .",
    "@xcite also reconstructed the explosions of grs 1915@xmath1105 and v4641 sgr .",
    "they found the explosion of cyg x-1 , in agreement with @xcite , to be a dark explosion ; i.e. , orders of magnitude less explosive than nova sco .",
    "using the relation between the he core mass ( @xmath8 ) of a giant after finishing h - core burning and the initial giant mass ( @xmath9 ) , m_he=0.08(m_giant/)^1.45 , [ eq : mhe ] lbw found that following common envelope evolution , a_f ( ) ^-0.55 a_i .",
    "[ eq : af]here @xmath10 is the final separation of the he star which remains from the giant following the strip off of its h envelope , and @xmath11 is its initial separation , @xmath12 is the mass of the donor ( secondary star ) .",
    "noteworthy about eq .",
    "( [ eq : af ] ) is that the main dependence of the final separation @xmath10 is on the donor mass @xmath12 , only roughly as the square root of @xmath9 .",
    "the he star remainder of the giant and the donor are tidally locked at the end of common envelope evolution ( lbw ) .",
    "the tidal locking ends here , the kerr parameter of the black hole being determined by its angular momentum at formation , minus the decrease from angular momentum spent in powering explosions .    from kepler",
    "we have for the preexplosion period = ( ) ^3/2 ( ) ^1/2 [ eq : pb ] where @xmath12 and @xmath8 are the masses at the time of common envelope evolution . given @xmath13",
    "we can easily find the kerr parameter @xmath4 from fig .",
    "12 of lbw , reproduced as figure  [ fig12 ] here . in the case of nova sco , @xmath14day , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( lbw ) .",
    "the big advantage that case c mass transfer has is that it not only produces an explosion with no hydrogen envelope , but it produces a great deal of angular momentum , as quantified in the kerr parameter of the black hole , to power the grb and hypernova .",
    "the angular momentum results from the tidal locking of the donor and the he star , the latter falling into the black hole . in the core ,",
    "the helium is burned before common envelope evolution into carbon and , rather quickly , oxygen .",
    "the strong @xmath18-field lines , which at one end thread the disk of the black hole as it is formed from the collapse inwards of the ionized metals , are frozen at the other end in the metals and lock the disk tidally with these metals which constitute what is left of the original helium star .",
    "if we replace the helium star in the @xcite paper by our he star then the formation and spin up of the black hole is as these authors described .",
    "thus we basically have a collapsar with high angular momentum that has been spun up by tidal locking with the donor .",
    "note that there is no hydrogen envelope of the giant left , the hydrogen having been expelled in common envelope evolution .",
    "in table  [ tab - a ] we list the black hole masses , and our estimates of donor masses , all at the time of the end of common envelope evolution when the tidal locking was established between donor and helium star . these came from lbw and from @xcite .",
    "the kerr parameters are changed into energies using the blandford - znajek formulas @xcite e_bz=1.810 ^ 54 _ f(a _ ) [ eq : bz]where the efficiency @xmath19 for energy deposition in the ( perturbative ) fireball is taken to be @xmath20 ( for optimum impedance matching ) and f(a_)=1- .",
    "[ eq : fa ]    we note that cyg x@xmath01 ( 1956@xmath1350y ) probably went through a dark explosion @xcite meaning that at most , a very low energy , one or two magnitudes less than in the case of nova sco . the high kerr parameter ( @xmath21 ) for grs 1915@xmath0105 @xcite came chiefly from mass accretion following the explosion in which the black hole was born , and , therefore , had no influence on the grb @xcite .",
    "the measured kerr parameters are the present ones , and the energies to produce the grb and hypernova should be subtracted from our calculated ones .    what we see from table  [ tab - a ] is that the transient sources nova sco , il lupi , xte j1550@xmath0564 , and gs 2023@xmath1338 clearly had enough rotational energy to power both a grb and hypernova explosion .",
    "@xcite in discussing these for nova sco suggested that the energy was so great that the explosion disrupts the accretion disk ; this removes the magnetic fields anchored in the disk and self - limits the energy the blandford - znajek mechanism can deliver ( see the appendix ) .",
    "in addition to the 7 sources in table  [ tab - a ] , lbw worked out the kerr parameters of the 8 galactic x - ray transient sources with main sequence companions , all of which had @xmath22 s of @xmath23 which correspond to spin energies of @xmath24 ergs .    in @xcite",
    "the grb and hypernova explosion were reconstructed in all detail .",
    "the f - star donor in nova sco bore witness to the hypernova explosion through the @xmath25-particle nuclei deposited on it .",
    "in particular , a large amount of sulfur , which @xcite found typical of differentiating hypernovae from the more usual supernovae , was found .",
    "the kerr parameter of 0.8 found by lbw for the preexplosion spin was , within uncertainties , the same as the post explosion kerr parameters measured by @xcite .",
    "the grb was , of course , not recorded , but the rotational energy was tremendous so that the grb was either just begun or the accretion disk was smashed immediately .",
    "the system velocity was worked out .",
    "almost all of the natal angular momentum energy is still in the system , as measured by @xcite , meaning that very little was accepted for the explosion .",
    "in @xcite the population synthesis suggested a soft x - ray transient birth rate of @xmath26 sources per year per galaxy , which with @xmath27 galaxies within 200 mpc translates into 3750 gpc@xmath28yr@xmath29 .",
    "if we consider the beaming factor of @xmath30 , this is the same rate as the rate of subluminous sources investigated by @xcite , estimated at @xmath31 gpc@xmath28yr@xmath29 .",
    "the latter are thought to have come from low - metallicity galaxies , but it is none the less interesting that the rate of hypernovae from soft x - ray transient sources is the same as that of the subluminous bursts , especially because we have shown that only a small part of the black hole spin energy in soft x - ray transient sources went into the explosion , so that they would tend to be subluminous .",
    "the question of central engine for grb060218 was tackled by the 119 astronomers who signed the 5 papers in nature @xcite . from the supplementary information of @xcite one",
    "finds that the explosion 2006aj was type i@xmath32 in nature ; i.e. , in addition to no hydrogen lines , no helium nor carbon . the only place where this could occur was in a black hole in which convective carbon burning ceases because the carbon abundance drops below 15% : see fig .  1 of @xcite .",
    "this leaves no doubt but that the central engine was powered by a black hole , one of low mass .",
    "galactic grbs ( grbs from galaxies with solar metallicity ) must be subluminous , relatively little of their tremendous rotational energy being used up in the explosion . for",
    "the population of metal poor subluminous grbs one would expect their donors to be more massive because of their low metallicity .",
    "because of the more massive donors they will have less rotational energy , which may be all utilized in the explosions or , at least , will take larger to dismantle the disk .",
    "thus they would be of relatively long duration , but subluminous in the integrated energy in the explosion .",
    "recently an eclipsing binary m33 x-7 was discovered in a metal poor neighborhood ( @xmath33solar ) by orosz ( 2007 ) .",
    "this can be evolved like a more massive cyg x-1 , but with the advantage that one knows the donor to be @xmath34 at the time of explosion .",
    "the kerr parameter was @xmath35 and the angular momentum energy of @xmath36 ergs was too little to both power the jet for a grb and the hypernova , so the explosion was probably `` dark .",
    "'' had the donor been less massive , according to our arguments , then with more energy the grb and hypernova could have been powered .",
    "we agree that the subluminous bursts come chiefly from metal poor galaxies @xcite , giving the dynamical reason that they have low angular momentum energies because of larger donor masses .",
    "we show that the rotational energy of black holes in soft x - ray transient sources is greatest when the donor in the binary is of low mass . in the case of large donor masses ,",
    "the rotational energy in the black hole binary is lower .",
    "one can see that nova sco had a very high explosion energy from the fact that its space velocity after the explosion is @xmath37 km s@xmath29 as to compare with cyg x@xmath01 relative to cyg ob3 in the cluster of o - stars of @xmath38 km s@xmath29 , which is typical of the random velocities of stars in expanding associations @xcite .    the explanation of why the angular momentum energy is so high in nova sco was given on p.176 of @xcite : _  the massive star will have evolved through its supergiant ( he core burning stage ) before matter overflows its roche lobe . then , by that time , a main sequence companion must be at just the right distance to receive the overflow ; this means @xmath39 , the roche lobe of the massive star being at @xmath40 .",
    "since the binding energy of the envelope of the massive star goes as @xmath41 , this binding energy is very small , so that the envelope can be removed by the drop in gravitational energy of an @xmath42 main sequence star as it moves inwards in common envelope evolution with the massive star from @xmath43 to the much smaller roche lobe of the he star which results when the h envelope is removed from the massive star . in this way",
    "one could understand why all of the main sequence companions of the black holes in the transient sources were of nearly the same low masses , @xmath44 . \"",
    "_ for the companions with masses @xmath45 , the necessary drop in gravitational energy is only @xmath46 that of the @xmath47 companion , so the final @xmath10 can be an order of magnitude greater .",
    "the result is an order of magnitude lower rotational energy .    from the above explanation",
    "we see that the ultrahigh rotational energies in soft x - ray transient sources are a result of the low donor masses .",
    "the rotational energy drops roughly inversely with mass so we would expect it to be an order of magnitude less for stars of low metallicity whose masses are roughly an order of magnitude greater than stars in our galaxy .",
    "thus , cosmological grbs will not have so much rotational energy as to dismantle the disk , and may be able to furnish their rotational energy to the grb and hypernova . at least , now that we understand why galactic grbs are so energetic , we can offer reasons why the cosmological grbs have lower energy , but may be able to use up more of it in the explosion .",
    "measurement of the kerr parameter for xte j1550 - 564 ( j. mcclintock et al .",
    ", smithsonian - harvard coalition , in progress ) will enable us to say how much of the natal @xmath48bethes was used up in the explosion .",
    "in summary , the essential points of our paper are that the woosley collapsar model can be obtained from our case c mass transfer , but with the black hole having any desired angular momentum , by making choice of the donor mass .",
    "because the helium is burned preceding the explosion in case c mass transfer , the ashes of the central helium , carbon and oxygen , fall first into the black hole and ensure the tidal locking through the strong b - field lines which are frozen in the ionized metals .",
    "our results for the lbw calculation of kerr parameters have been confirmed by the smithsonian - harvard group . given the kerr parameters , we can make quantitative calculation of the spin energy of black hole .",
    "we give predictions for the kerr parameters of 12 galactic black hole sources which have not yet been measured .",
    "we note that the rotational energy of m33 x-7 was lower than that of cosmological grbs and suggest that these originate from low metallicity donors of somewhat less mass than that of m33 x-7 . our suggestion that xte j1550 - 564 should have the angular momentum energy in its explosion , which is as large as that of cosmological grbs ,",
    "should soon be tested by the measurement of the kerr parameter .",
