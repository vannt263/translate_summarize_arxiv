    "in the last decades , statistical mechanics has seen an outstanding progress as a powerful mathematical tool , physically oriented , for analyzing complex systems of the most diverse nature .",
    "a special impulse was later given to the interplay between concepts close to the realm of statistical physics , mostly within the spin glass theory @xcite , and the mathematical theory of complexity for optimization problems @xcite .",
    "in more recent years , the developments in complex network theory and its numerous applications have made even stronger the importance of statistical mechanics as a very interdisciplinary mathematical tool @xcite . in network theory ,",
    "elements and interactions are simplified as nodes and links between them .",
    "several models for growing or static networks have been proposed and turned out able to reproduce the main universal features observed in real networks .",
    "one of the most promising frameworks to analyze networks is provided by hidden variables models @xcite .",
    "the general idea behind hidden variable models relies on the possibility that each node is attributed a value @xmath8 that expresses its propensity to be connected to another node with hidden variable @xmath9 via a formula that relates @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "it turns out that this scheme is both very general and very powerful in the description of many diverse networks , especially with respect to the possibility of having analytic results .    in this paper , we use statistical mechanics to face and solve two concatenated problems in hidden variable models . we first develop a general approach to extrapolate the typical configurations of a generic hidden - variables model , _",
    "i.e. _ , we use statistical mechanics to derive , in the thermodynamic limit , the equations that describe , in the space of the hidden variables @xmath8 , the node distribution @xmath10 corresponding to the most important graph realizations ( the others being exponentially rare in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "then , we apply these general equations to random geometric graphs ( rgg ) @xcite where the @xmath8 s represent vector positions . unlike random or common complex network models , in rgg nodes",
    "are connected according to an underlying geometry ( euclidean or not ) . in particular , in classical rgg two nodes are connected if their distance is at most equal to a given threshold .",
    "rgg are important in many theoretical and practical aspects , but despite that , the exact analysis of rgg has been mostly confined to the euclidean @xmath11 and @xmath12 dimensional cases , and mainly focused on the percolation problem .",
    "notice that , when @xmath13 , rgg are not tree - like networks .",
    "in fact , they have dense loops , _",
    "i.e. _ , the probability that a random walk of @xmath14 links is closed remains finite for any @xmath15 , even in the infinite size limit ( for @xmath16 this amounts to a finite clustering coefficient ) .",
    "this fact avoids using the same probabilistic techniques , like the belief - propagation ( or bethe - peierls ) methods , which are exact only on tree - like graphs .",
    "it is worth mentioning here the kasteleyn and fortuin approach to the percolation problem @xcite , which maps the counting of connected clusters toward the mean - field potts model ; an outstanding example of how statistical mechanics can be used to solve combinatorial problems ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , when we are dealing with rgg , due to the presence of dense loops , the kasteleyn and fortuin approach would require to solve a non mean - field potts model , an analytically unfeasible task .    in this paper",
    "we adopt a different approach .",
    "we do not aim to analyzing the percolation problem in rgg , nor to have a full descriptive solution of rgg ( which would allow us to know all the graph metrics ) .",
    "rather , we look for reduced descriptive , yet exact , solutions . by using the hidden variable framework , and our general result for the typical configurations , we face a practical satisfaction problem : given @xmath0 nodes , a domain @xmath1 , and a desired average connectivity @xmath2 , find - if any - the distribution of nodes having support in @xmath1 and average connectivity @xmath2 .",
    "notice that this is a typical problem in ad hoc wireless optimized networks @xcite : embedded in a space with @xmath12 or @xmath17 dimensions , one has @xmath0 mobile devices that must be connected , in average , with a certain number of neighbors at a minimal cost .",
    "furthermore , it might also be required that the whole structure be a connected graph .",
    "however , we find out that , in the thermodynamic limit , nodes can only be either uniformly distributed or highly condensed in a small region , the two regimes being separated by a first order phase transition characterized by a @xmath3 jump of @xmath2 ( see fig.[fig0 ] for an example whose details will be discussed later ) .",
    "other intermediate values of @xmath2 correspond only to very rare graph realizations .",
    "the phase transition is triggered by the underlying geometry whose strength can be tuned by a parameter @xmath4 $ ] , with @xmath5 for rigid geometry ( only close nodes are connected ) and @xmath6 for rigid anti - geometry ( only distant nodes are connected ) . consistently , when @xmath7 there is no geometry and no phase transition .",
    "after discussing the numerical solution for rgg in @xmath11 dimensions , we provide a combinatorial argument to fully explain the mechanism inducing this phase transition in general rgg . in turn",
    ", the combinatorial argument leads us to recognize the phase transition as an easy - hard - ease transition , the hard solutions of the problem being located in between the uniform and condensed regimes , _",
    "i.e. _ , at the critical point .",
    "furthermore , we show that the hard solutions corresponding to connected graphs are networks quite heterogeneous .",

    "in fact , for such a specific example we have full control of the average number of links via the parameter @xmath40 inside the function @xmath28 .",
    "notice that , given any couple @xmath28 and @xmath27 , the hidden variable scheme defined through the steps _ i)-ii ) _ determines an ensemble of graphs whose properties , like average connectivity , degree distribution , density of triangles etc ... , are all mathematically encoded in @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "however , only in a few cases the relation between these ensemble properties and the parameters entering the functions @xmath28 and @xmath27 turn out to be relatively simple . in general , given @xmath28 and @xmath27 , we are not able to control directly the ensemble properties via these parameters , not even the average number of links .",
    "in fact , this is the case for rgg .",
    "therefore , for the sake of generality , we will allow for the presence of a chemical potential @xmath20 to be adjusted toward a suitable value in order to have a desired average number of links .",
    "let be given a hidden - variables model through the functions @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "there are two kinds of network ensembles that can be generated . inspired by statistical mechanics , we call these two ensembles : canonical and gran canonical .    _ canonical ensemble . _",
    "if we make a _ una tantum _ sampling of the @xmath8 s and these are kept fixed , we are dealing with an ensemble of graphs where the @xmath8 s play the role of parameters , while the random variables are the elements of the adjacency matrix @xmath41 , each taking the values @xmath42 or @xmath43 for the presence or absence of a link , respectively .",
    "examples include networks whose nodes have fixed expected degrees and , more in general , networks that can be described as exponential random graphs @xcite",
    ". one peculiar feature of the canonical ensemble is that the relative fluctuations of graph - observables that are extensive in the system size tend to 0 for @xmath44 .",
    "this fact allows to extrapolate many characteristics of the ensemble which we can define as `` typical '' @xcite .",

    ". another example is provided by gradient networks , where the @xmath8 s determine the flow directions @xcite .",
    "however , the gran canonical ensemble is not just an enlargement of the canonical one ; it has a quite different nature . unlike the canonical ensemble , in the gran canonical ensemble ,",
    "in general , fluctuations of extensive quantities can not be neglected . in particular , it has been shown that , in the scale - free model ( [ cm])-([rho ] ) , the number of links and the entropy are the only observables whose relative fluctuations can be neglected when @xmath45 @xcite . in order to calculate the ensemble averages , @xmath46 , one has to evaluate a generalized partition function , or functional generator , @xmath47 , where the @xmath48 and the @xmath49 are external fields conjugated to the variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "a manifestation of the large fluctuations of the gran canonical ensemble is that @xmath47 can not be calculated via saddle point techniques ( in appendix [ appa ] we show this in detail ) .",
    "however , under certain conditions , we can still find some typical features of the ensemble , exactly .",
    "in fact , if we limit the description of a graph to its hidden - variables sequence , such a plan is mathematically possible . to this aim",

    "note that , as the combinatorial argument makes clear , we are still able to build graphs with any desired connectivity @xmath2 . in order to do so , it is in fact enough to split the @xmath0 nodes into @xmath258 groups each containing @xmath259 nodes which , inside the group , are sufficiently close to each other so that each forms a fully connected graph of @xmath259 nodes .",
    "if the ratio @xmath258 is not an integer , it is still possible to consider slight variations of this construction in order to reach the desired average connectivity ( for example by introducing some asymmetry among the groups ) .",

    "the network so constructed is connected and can give rise to a wide spectra of cases according to @xmath39 - the exponent characterizing the degree distribution @xmath38 - which in turn depends on @xmath264 , but the network could also be non power law .",

    "the two cases correspond , formally , to @xmath289 and to @xmath290 , respectively , compatibly with @xcite .",

    ", we can analyze the percolation as follows .",
    "let us consider a @xmath333dimensional rigid ( @xmath5 ) euclidean rgg with domain @xmath334 . here",
    "@xmath8 represents a position vector in @xmath335 .",
    "given @xmath163 , two nodes are connected if and only if their euclidean distance is at most @xmath162 .",
    "given the number of nodes @xmath0 , the initial density @xmath27 ( which in turn defines @xmath1 ) , and the solution @xmath291 of eqs .",
    "( [ spq1 ] ) , let us define the following set in the continuum @xmath336 where @xmath337 stands for the @xmath333ball of radius @xmath162 centered at @xmath8 .",
    "the set @xmath338 provides the positions @xmath8 s where , in average , there is at least one node within the balls @xmath337 s .",
    "it is then clear that , in the limit in which we can neglect fluctuations of the node positions , the rgg will be percolating if @xmath338 is a connected set in @xmath334 ( in the topological sense ) . let us consider the standard case where nodes are uniformly sprinkled over @xmath335 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath339 . in this case",
    "we have also @xmath340 , from which we get that , depending on the value of @xmath162 , we have either @xmath341 , or @xmath342 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath335 is connected , the rgg is percolating if @xmath343 , and not percolating if @xmath344 , where @xmath345 where @xmath346 is the solid angle in @xmath210 dimension . despite our crude approximation in neglecting the node fluctuations",
    ", the dependence of @xmath347 on @xmath0 turns out to be correct ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , in @xmath12 dimension the percolation threshold @xmath348 , _ i.e. _ , the minimal value of @xmath162 where a giant connected component appears , is rigorously known to be @xmath349 . however , the critical value of @xmath162 above which the rgg is also connected , is rigorously known to be @xmath350 , therefore the argument of the above approximation is not fully consistent .",
    "however , it has the advantage that it is general and can be applied to any sprinkle @xmath27 , not necessarily uniform or nearly uniform . clearly , the smaller is the variance of @xmath351 , the better is the approximation .",
