    "even when the vla observations lack sufficient angular resolution to detect more subtle motions ( i.e. geometric parallax ) , they can provide not only the average proper motion of the region but also reveal the presence of stars moving with peculiar velocities with respect to the region , such as those found in the orion bn / kl region ( rodrguez et al .",

    "much more accurate astrometry can be achieved using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) techniques ( e.g. loinard et al . 2007 ) , but these observations are restricted to very compact and bright non thermal radio stars and can not be applied to thermal sources , where the emission is relatively extended and its brightness temperature is not expected to exceed @xmath5  k , far below the sensitivity of present day vlbi .",

    "the optically visible star svs  13 , discovered as a near - ir source ( strom et al .",
    "1976 ) , is roughly aligned with the chain of hh objects and was proposed as the powering source of this hh system .",
    "this association was questioned by rodrguez et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who discovered a cm radio source ( vla 3 ) located @xmath8 to the sw of svs  13 , and argued that this new object is a better candidate to drive the hh outflow .",
    "svs  13 is also associated with cm emission ( source vla  4 of rodrguez et al .",
    "1997 ) and mm emission ( looney et al . 2000 ) .",
    "bachiller et al . (",
    "2000 ) , through interferometric observations , found that svs  13 is associated with an `` extremely '' high velocity molecular outflow , although `` standard '' velocity gas was found in the vicinity of both svs  13 and vla  3 .",
    "subarcsecond vla observations at 3.6 cm and 7 mm by anglada et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2004 ) revealed that the radio source associated with svs  13 is actually a close binary with two components , vla  4a and 4b , separated by 0@xmath93 ( @xmath1065 au ) .",
    "interestingly , a detailed analysis of the positions and spectral energy distribution in the cm - mm range suggests that the two sources have very different properties : vla  4b appears to be associated with the observed strong mm emission , probably arising from a circumstellar dust disk , while vla  4a is the counterpart of the visible star svs  13 with dust emission absent or much less significant in this component .    since high velocity water masers are indicators of outflow activity and can be observed with high angular resolution , rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2002 ) analyzed archive vla data of the water masers associated with svs  13 in order to investigate which of the two stars of the binary system was the most likely candidate to drive the outflow .",
    "it was found that the water masers appear segregated in two groups , according to their position and lsr velocity .",
    "a group with the lsr velocity similar to that of the ambient cloud is associated with vla  4a , and a blueshifted velocity group is associated with vla  4b .",
    "this result was interpreted as favoring vla  4b as the outflow driving source .",
    "however , the study of rodrguez et al . (",
    "2002 ) was restricted to the line - of - sight component of the velocity .",
    "recently , hirota et al . (",
    "2008 ) presented vlbi astrometric observations with vera and derived absolute positions and proper motions of the order of 15 - 20 mas  yr@xmath2 ( corresponding to velocities of 16 - 22 km  s@xmath2 ) of the water masers associated with svs  13 .",
    "these observations confirm the positional association with vla  4a of the masers with an lsr velocity close to that of the ambient cloud .",
    "however , the proper motions ( velocity and direction ) relative to the sources could not be firmly established because of a poor knowledge of the absolute proper motions of the region .",
    "in fact , the optical data of herbig & jones ( 1983 ) suggest that the stars projected upon heavy obscuration ( presumably associated with the ngc 1333 cloud ) have an average proper motion of @xmath1010 mas yr@xmath2 relative to the stars near the edge of the obscuration ( presumably background stars ) .",
    "this suggests that the absolute proper motion of the region could have a significant contribution to the proper motions of the masers observed by hirota et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "in this paper we present an absolute astrometry analysis and proper motion calculations over 10 years of four thermal radio sources in the ngc  1333 region .",
    "there are no reports of absolute proper motions for embedded young stars in this region and our study provides the first determination of these motions .",
    "data at 3.6 cm continuum were taken using the vla of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao )  .",
    "the data consist of six epochs of observations , ranging from 1989 january 14 to 1999 july 3 , obtained using the a configuration of the vla , which provides an angular resolution of @xmath100@xmath93 .",
    "a requirement to obtain reliable astrometry is that the same phase calibrator has been used for most or preferably all observations .",
    "this requirement is accomplished in our case since all observations were made using 0333 + 321 as phase calibrator .",
    "data editing and calibration were carried out using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) package of nrao , following the standard vla procedures .",
    "the observation dates , the bootstrapped flux densities of 0333 + 321 , as well as the parameters of the synthesized beams , and the rms noise of the naturally weighted maps are given in table [ tabla1 ] .",
    "since the nominal position of the phase calibrator used in the first epoch was slightly different from that used in the other five epochs ( the positions of the phase calibrators are periodically refined at the vla ) , in order to obtain more accurate astrometry , we corrected its position using the task clcor of aips before calibration of the first epoch .",

    ", whose velocity is about one half the velocity obtained for the other sources .",
    "this possible velocity difference of 8 - 10 km  s@xmath2 between vla  4a and the ambient cloud may account for the yet unexplained large increase in the optical and near - ir brightness of vla  4a that took place in 1988 - 1990 ( eislffel et al .",
    "the source may have simply displaced from a very obscured region to a position where it became more easily detectable . however , because of the signal - to - noise limitation of the data plus the errors produced by the intrinsic differences in the morphologies , orientations and flux densities of the sources ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , we can not conclude that the differences between the values obtained for each source indicate statistically significant differences in the motions of the objects .    as a representative value of the proper motion of the ngc  1333 region as a whole",
    "we adopt the weighted average of the proper motion of the four sources , @xmath0 = 9 @xmath1 1 mas  yr@xmath2 and @xmath3 = @xmath410 @xmath1 2 mas  yr@xmath2 . assuming a distance of 235  pc for ngc  1333 , these values",
    "imply a velocity of 16 @xmath1 2 km  s@xmath2 along a p.a . of 140@xmath12 @xmath1 10@xmath12 .",
    "this is the first measurement of the proper motion directly made on embedded objects that belong to the ngc  1333 star forming region .",
    "therefore , we believe that our value is , up to date , the most representative of the proper motion of ngc 1333 .    the proper motion of the ngc  1333 region obtained from our data can be compared with the value expected due to the effect of the differential galactic rotation and the motion of the sun with respect to the lsr . assuming the solar motion with respect to the lsr based on the hipparcos satellite , ( u@xmath13 , v@xmath13 , w@xmath13)=(10.00 , 5.25 , 7.17 ) km  s@xmath2 ( dehnen & binney 1998 ) , the model of brand & blitz ( 1993 ) for the galactic rotation , and a distance of 235 pc for ngc  1333 , we would expect proper motions of @xmath0 = 2.9 mas  yr@xmath2 and @xmath3 = @xmath47.5 mas  yr@xmath2 , that imply a velocity of @xmath109 km  s@xmath2 along a p.a . of @xmath10160@xmath12 .",
    "this velocity is @xmath107 km  s@xmath2 smaller than the value obtained from our data .",
    "since the difference between the proper motion predicted by the model and our measurements is of the order of the one - dimensional rms velocity dispersion observed between molecular clouds ( 7.8 km  s@xmath2 ; stark & brand 1989 ) , we attribute this difference to the peculiar motion of the ngc  1333 cloud .",
    "we have looked for optical stars associated with ngc  1333 with proper motions measured by hipparcos .",
    "the only nearby star we find with these characteristics is bd  +  30@xmath12549 , a b8:p type star that illuminates part of the reflection nebula ngc  1333 ( e.g. rodrguez et al .",
    "1990 ) . for this star ,",
    "hipparcos reports proper motions of @xmath0 = 6.31@xmath12.35 mas  yr@xmath2 and @xmath3 = -8.87@xmath11.77 mas  yr@xmath2 ( perryman et al . 1997 ) .",
    "these values agree with the weighted average obtained by us at the @xmath11-@xmath14 level .",
    "our results confirm that the source vla  3 is a member of the ngc  1333 molecular cloud since this source shows the same proper motion that the other members of the cloud .",
    "although this conclusion alone does not resolve the problem of the identification of the powering source of the hh 7 - 11 system , our results discard the possibility that vla  3 is a foreground or background source not related to the ngc  1333 region .",
    "therefore , the proximity of vla  3 to the base of the hh 7 - 11 system is physically real , and not only a projection effect .",
    "the determination of the proper motions of embedded young stars in ngc  1333 is useful to reanalyze the proper motions of water masers reported by hirota et al .",
    "these authors report vlbi observations of two maser features associated with vla  4a ( svs  13 ) .",
    "they found absolute proper motions of the order of 15 - 20 mas  yr@xmath2 in a direction ( p.a.@xmath15114@xmath12 - 133@xmath12 ) roughly aligned with the jets and outflows in the region .",
    "however , as noted by hirota et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , these proper motions contain a significant contribution due to the relative motion of the ngc  1333 region with respect to the sun . in order to correct for the contribution due to the relative motion of the ngc  1333 region with respect to the sun , hirota et al .",
    "( 2008 ) subtracted the theoretical proper motion of the region due to the solar motion relative to the lsr ( neglecting the contribution of galactic rotation , that they show is small ) .",
    "this correction results in proper motions of the order of 7 - 14 mas  yr@xmath2 , and a significant change in the direction .",
    "the proper motions corrected in this way are not parallel to the hh 7 - 11 jet and co outflow . however , as we have discussed above , there is still a significant contribution due to the peculiar proper motion of the ngc  1333 region that must be taken into account for a proper interpretation of the results .",
    "our results show that the mean proper motion of the ngc  1333 region ( @xmath0 = 9@xmath11 mas yr@xmath2 and @xmath3 = @xmath410@xmath12 mas  yr@xmath2 ) determined from the four embedded thermal sources is comparable to the absolute proper motions found by hirota et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for the two water maser features associated with vla  4a ( @xmath0 = 17.9@xmath10.9 mas  yr@xmath2 and @xmath3 = @xmath47.9@xmath11.4 mas  yr@xmath2 for feature 1 , and @xmath0 = 10.6@xmath11.7 mas  yr@xmath2 and @xmath3 = @xmath410.0@xmath12.1 mas  yr@xmath2 for feature 2 ) .",
    "therefore , this correction appears to be very important to obtain the true proper motions relative to the region .",
    "the close coincidence for feature 2 suggests that this maser is almost stationary with respect to the cloud and that is not tracing significant peculiar proper motions .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the fact that the lsr velocity of the masers ( 7 - 8 km  s@xmath2 ) nearly coincides with the lsr velocity of the molecular cloud , as already noted by rodrguez et al . (",
    "after correction for the proper motion of the ngc  1333 region determined by us , feature 1 has residual proper motions of @xmath0 = 9@xmath12 mas  yr@xmath2 and @xmath3 = 2@xmath13 mas  yr@xmath2 .",
    "this indicate motions to the east ( p.a.@xmath1590@xmath12 ) with a velocity of @xmath1010 km  s@xmath2 , that align poorly with the chain of bright hh 7 - 11 objects and the molecular outflow .",
    "in any case , these small residual proper motions align much better with the faint chain of hh objects ( a , b , c and d ) found by davis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , that aligns in the west - east direction ( see fig . 2 of rodrguez et al .",
    "1997 where the positions of the sources discussed in this paper and the hh objects are also shown ) .",
    "we note , from the analysis discussed above , that we obtained proper motions of the maser features relative to the ngc1333 cloud .",
    "an unambiguous measurement of the proper motions relative to vla  4a would require to subtract the individual proper motion of this source instead of the average motion of the ngc  1333 region .",
    "the nominal proper motion velocity we obtained for this source is about one half the average value of the region .",
    "taken at face value , it could suggest that the vla  4a source has a significant velocity relative to the ambient cloud .",
    "however , the weakness of the source does not allow a reliable determination of its individual proper motion with the currently available data .",
    "additional , high sensitivity data would be required to investigate possible motions of the vla  4a source relative to the ngc  1333 cloud in order to accurately determine the motions of the water maser features relative to vla  4a .",
    "we have presented the results of multi - epoch high angular resolution vla observations at 3.6 cm of the ngc  1333 star forming region . from these observations",
    "we have measured the absolute positions at different epochs of four thermal sources ( vla  2 , vla  3 , vla  4a and vla  4b ) tracing ysos embedded in this region . all these sources show an absolute proper motion to the se , which we interpret as a proper motion of the ngc  1333 region as a whole . from our data",
    "we obtained the average values @xmath0 = 9 @xmath1 1 mas  yr@xmath2 and @xmath3 = @xmath410 @xmath1 2 mas  yr@xmath2 , that we interpret as representative of the proper motion of the molecular cloud associated with the ngc  1333 region as a whole .",
    "our results allow us to correct the proper motion measurements of water maser spots associated with vla  4a ( svs 13 ) obtained by hirota et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in order to obtain the proper motions relative to the ngc  1333 cloud .",
    "we conclude that feature 2 of hirota et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is practically stationary with respect to the cloud , and that the small residual proper motions of feature 1 indicate motions to the east , suggesting that none of these features is associated with the hh 7 - 11 system or the molecular outflow .",
    "our data also suggest that vla  3 is a member of the ngc  1333 molecular cloud , since this source shows a proper motion similar to that of the others sources embedded in the region . since the position of vla  3 appears close to the base of the hh 7 - 11 system , we conclude that this proximity is physically real , and not a projection effect .    _",
